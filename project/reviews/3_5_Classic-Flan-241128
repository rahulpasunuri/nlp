I made this flan in a large corning casserole because I was planning to make it for a crowd and couldn't deal with ramekins. It worked well, but I thought the flan had too strong of an eggy taste. Maybe 2 eggs and 2 yolks instead of 4 whole eggs would have made it a bit smoother and less eggy.

I grew up knowing flan as crème caramel. Simple recipe! However the caramel topping takes too long to make. Like katanas I recommend the "dry" method of caramelizing sugar. The texture of the flan is smooth and silky. The first time I made this I forgot to heat the water for the water bath and the flan took twice as long to set. If this happens to you, just tent the custard cups with aluminum foil and check custard periodically with the toothpick test. FYI, used vanilla bean instead of extract but it didn't seem to have much impact because of the strong flavor of the caramel.

I had trouble with the caramel sauce. First batch I pitched; it never got to amber. Second time around I just caramelized the sugar without water. I know from experience it works just fine that way. Cleanup is pretty easy--simply add water and boil; the caramelized remnants will dissolve into the water, dump, wash, done.

Easy and delicious. I used 1 TB of vanilla, 1% milk, and chilled it for 3 hours with great results. A great make ahead dessert for a party. I daresay you could eat it for breakfast...

Easy to prepare dessert that is packed with lots of flavor. It's firm but still creamy. I'm with everyone else...a few seconds makes the difference between carmel sauce with deep amber color and burnt carmel sauce. I doubled the recipe and made 8 larger flans. I found running a knife around the edges and dipping the ramekin in a bath of hot water helped the flan to come out quickly and easily. It's a sure crowd pleaser!

Made this for my brother's birthday because it's one of his favorite desserts and it was great. I did change one thing - instead of two cups whole milk I did one cup whole milk and one cup sweetened condensed milk and then decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup. I could have cooked the sugar and water a bit longer, but I was paranoid about burning it. It still tasted good, but didn't have the beautiful amber color.

I have tried many flan recipes over the years but this is the most simple and reliable one available. The difficult part is making the caramel due to the fact that once the sugar is really hot the difference between a nice flavorful syrup and a burned, smelly hard to clean pan is about 30 seconds....this dessert ALWAYS elicits favorable comments from guests.

delicious, easy. I followed the directions, except I made a 1.5x batch b/c I was cooking for 8. That made enough sauce for 8 ramekins w/ a little extra custard. Big payoff for a little prep.

definitely need to cook the caramel/syrup until thick in its pan! ten minutes seems about right. i used a round corningware instead of six ramekins, and it turned out well. i just rolled the thick syrup around the rims after using a pastry brush to "paint" the sides first, then allowed the syrup to thicken slightly on the bottom & sides. i also recommend boiling the water or using very hot water for the pan that surrounds the flan dish -- i used lukewarm water the first time, and it took about two hours to bake. this flan was firm-ish, but made a wet "sweaty" goo on its plate when served. the second time, using boiling water from my kettle for the pan, took 45-50 minutes to bake and looked much better! i also used mexican vanilla for a really flavorful taste. this is otherwise surprisingly simple with just a few (and common!) ingredients....

OK, the caramel syrup part is tricky- -you have to stay very close to the bubbling syrup because it goes from clear to gold to amber very quickly. Also, you need to lift it off the heat and pour it into the ramekins or big dish immediately. . .if you let it sit it will keep cooking and burn on you. You can use a soup spoon to distribute the syrup among six ramekins. It helps if you have someone to 'rock' them as you pour to better cover the bottoms, but don't fret if the caramel hardens without spreading. . .it will soften as it bakes. I found it wasn't enough to run a knife around the edges of the ramekins; I dipped each one in a hot bath for a few seconds, then gave it a good tap to invert. Picture perfect and very delicious!

It was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I would make it again. The only problem is that you have to empty the strainer very often.

Ok, so I haven't inverted the pan yet onto my cake plate. That will be the real test. I did taste a bit and it was delicious, classic. I found the caramel sauce to be difficult: i did 2 batches, the first one i used unbleached sugar and it really never turned amber. i dumped it. the second one i used the same sugar, but i could tell it was heading in the same direction so i added about 1/4 cup more of reg. sugar and it was perfect. what the recipe doesn't tell you is that when the caramel cools in the baking pan is hardens like candy. i couldn't imagine how it would possibly turn out ok, but now the caramel sauce is liquidy, just as it should be.

I'm not sure what I did wrong here. The first time I made the caramel, it went quickly from deep amber to burnt, and I had to toss it. The second time, I cooked it to more of a medium amber, but then when it baked it turned almost clear, with no caramely taste at all. The custard itself had an unpleasant eggy taste at the first bite, but subsequent bites were better. I was hoping for a beautiful turnout like in the photo, but got a pale, insipid flan instead.

Followed the recipe to the letter, and the results were great. Perfect, sure-fire, make-ahead dessert.
