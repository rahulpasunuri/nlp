I was looking for a taco salad recipe and this is it! I already had homemade taco sauce in the freezer so that is what I used to season the meat. The dressing for this salad is great! I did add corn and made salsa as well. We will be having this again.

I always follow the recipe EXACTLY the first time. If I don't like it, I make changes the 2nd time around. With this one, I know I will not be making any changes. It was WONDRFUL! It was simple, refreshing and tasty. I would NOT want to add sour cream to this salad as many have suggested. highly recommend! :)

tastes fantastic and love that salad and beef are placed on lettuce leaves. GREAT salad!

I made this for company for lunch. A GREAT! salad but it makes a ton. I've changed the servings from 6 to 10. I used ground turkey and reduced fat cheese. I served the salad with salsa and sour cream. It definitely needs more spice and the salsa did the trick. I would probably use salsa instead of the tomato sauce next time. I had leftovers for lunch 3 days later and it was still good. I wasn't sure how it was supposed to be served so I tossed it. If you used a shallow pan you could probably scoop out untossed layered servings. Reviews didn't mention how they served.

Tossed the greens (romaine, shredded red cabbage, arugula) with some of the dressing. Layered in baked tortilla bowls. Used fresh tomato, not sauce, in the beef. Added chopped sweet onion on top. Served with freshly made salsa and sour cream and the remaining dressing on the side. We ate every scrap.

I've made this twice, and the second time was even better. I added more serano peppers (2 more), and everyone loved the taste.

By far the best taco salad I have ever eaten. Holy crap. Very filling and even my salad-hater hubby LOVED it. The lime/cilantro/cumin/chili in dressing combined with the meat is quite savory.

This is a great recipe - I love the beef but add more of the spices. I serve this without cheese to make it healthier and it still tastes great.

I substituted Agave syrup for the sugar in the dressing and I found it to be very tasty. I omitted the serrano chiles and didn't think they were missed. Also, I'm not crazy about iceberg, so I used mixed greens and used guacamole instead of just avocado and omitted the beans and olives. I would definitely make it again and try to vary the recipe a bit

This was tasty and a nice departure from the usual taco salads--more of true salad than some of those in my file.Though it could not really be considered a light dish, it it certainly less heavy and more appropriate for summer than many other versions.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe to prepare when entertaining a group. I've made it many times and don't change anything except for using a mix of iceberg and leaf lettuces and cutting the dressing quantity in half. I love the taco meat. The presentation is also very pretty when served in a glass bowl.

Took this to the office party, and it was a HIT. Changes - No dressing - when I tasted it, I couldn't understand it. Perhaps it would have mixed well, but I didn't want to risk it. Much more salt in the beef. Green Peppers in the beef. Red Onion instead of yellow. Also, great beef recipe. At home, I like to keep the ingredients separate, so the meat can be warm and melt the cheese.

This is one of the six salads I made for a Salad Luncheon I hostessed at our home on Saturday. It was a smashing success! We live in an area that is highly cultural for Mexican Cuisine and most of my guests are picky on "fake" Mexican. This had the wonderful fresh and lively flavors we are used to, and it was authentic from the State of Sonora point of view! I did a mix of the stated Ice Berg with some Romaine and Red Leaf for color.

I made this recipe for my week's lunch and enjoyed it. I liked it a bit better warm then cold though so next time I might make it into a hot dish by substituting the lettuce layer with rice. I thought the dressing and the spices for the meat made this dish. I did make some changes. For the dressing, I omitted the sugar from the dressing; added 1/2 c nonfat plain european style yogurt; reduced oil to 2tbsp. For the filling, I substituted 1 lb of lean ground turkey for the beef. For the toppings, I used reduced-fat cheese and omitted the olives. It was pretty tasty and I'll definitely make it again someday.

My copy of this recipe is so worn I had to print a one. My family LOVES this recipe and requests it when we all get together.

WOw. This was good. I did add some sweet peppers I roasted (the mini ones you can get at Sam's) and a dollop of light sour cream on top. It was labor intensive due to all the chopping, but if you had some help in the kitchen it would go by in no time.

Rating: 3
I made the dressing with half yogurt, half sour cream instead of oil, and tweaked the amount of seasonings a little - it was excellent. I made my own beef recipe (sauteed onion, ground beef a can of refried black beans, a small can of chopped chilis, some cumin & chili powder) and we topped our salads with that, the dressing, chips and salsa. It was just the right thing on a very hot summer night.

I can't say this blew me away. It was ok, the meat was flavorful but it was not what I was craving all day long!

Frankly I don't understand the previous rave reviews. This was bland tasting, the meat layered on top of the lettuce wilted the lettuce, and the dressing was tasteless. This is definitely not worth a second try.

This is really good!! I substituted chickpeas for the black beans--don't like black beans, my husband doesn't like pinto beans. I also used guacamole instead of avacados. This was delicious, a traditional, comfort dish.

I am only rating the dressing part of this recipe since I did my own thing with the meat and salad part. I used plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream and used artificial sweetener instead of sugar. I also did a bit of olive oil and also added some red wine vinegar. Out of cumin, so used ground coriander. Tasted great! (Even my finicky husband liked it.)

I know I am in the minority, but this was no 4 star taco salad! The meat was okay, but nothing spectacular. The dressing was very oily and did nothing for this very basic taco salad. You can make this without a recipe, and I'm sure it would come out a lot better.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of flavors. It will be an excellent dinner salad for informal entertaining this summer.

Fantastic Recipe! This will be one of my go to entree salads. Substituted ground turkey for beef, added a touch of cinnamon, minced serrano chiles, smoked paprika and cumin seeds to the mixture. Substituted honey for sugar and added smoked paprika to the dressing. Reduced oil to 6T. Fabulous!

Yum!! I substituted a 1/2 cup sour cream for the 1/2 cup olive oil in the dressing to cut down on fat and to still have sour cream on the salad. It turned out delicious! My husband loved it too. This is so much better than any taco salad I ever had.

Rating: 3
Awesome taco salad! I made it with turkey and no one knew the difference. I used canned refried beans as one of my layers (instead of pintos). Also added corn, olives, chopped red bell pepper and a dollop of sour cream. We ended up not even using the dressing (although it smelled and tasted good) because with the refried beans, the sour cream and the taco sauce, it was "dressed enough"...it wasn't dry. We figured the dressing would only make it soggy, so we skipped it. Got rave reviews at our house and it was a great way to get my stepson to eat some fresh veggies. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it's taco salad...hardly "beyond compare", but VERY very good! =)

made this for a Cinco de Mayo lunch at work and it disappeared. Used lots more lime juice. Will probably grate some lime zest into dressing next time. Also for the beef--used Pico de Gallo instead of peppers and tomato sauce. It worked great and the beef wasn't so liquid.

Very good. My family loved it. Suggestion on adding sour cream. Put sour cream in a squeeze bottle if s and pipe in criss cross fashion across the top. Could also serve this way on the side. This is a great way to more evenly distribute sour cream to this and other Mexican dishes.

Excellent! Was a bit concerned with the dressing right after I made it; it had a very strong olive oil taste. So I made a mayo-taco sauce dressing as a second choice. But later, after flavors got acquainted, the lime-olive oil dressing was the favored dressing. Served it with both dressings on the side for my wife's Ladies Golf Group luncheon and got raves.

Great family meal.I used taco sauce instead of tomato sauce as suugested by another reviewer-it works well. (Boca ground beef substitute works great here-meat eaters would never even know) Spiciness can be adjusted according to taste. Serve with sour cream, extra salsa and taco chips on the side. I really like the dressing. It is nicely seasoned and the lime juice keeps it refreshing.In the end, the dressing makes this dish several cuts above fast food taste and quality.

Absolutely delicious, in particular the beef recipe here is amazing - really full of flavor. I would also consider just using the beef recipe to make normal tacos as well. Oh, and the Serrano chilies are fairly mild, so definitely add two.

Good recipe, but high in fat (lots of oil in avocados, cheese, the dressing and the meat, even when you drain it off). I'd probably make this again with lean ground turkey or with Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles, which, when seasoned well, are a great meat substitute.

Rating: 4
This recipe really exceeded my expectations. My husband doesn't like taco salads and he loved it! I know that some reviewers have not liked the dressing, but I think it really sparked the entire dish up. We served without chips but added a considerable amount of chopped cilantro as a garnish.

This is an okay taco salad. The beef mix was great.There is something kind of heavy about the dressing. We love cilantro and we love taco salad, but something about this one just didn't "click" with us.

Enjoyed preparing this one almost as much as eating the finished product! Used a bit more chili powder and cumin to the beef for extra heat, and used jalepenos instead of serranos (I already had these on hand). And, of course, had to add a dollop of sour cream on top. Yum! A definite keeper!

Excellent summertime dish. You can do all the prep stuff in the cool of the day and then assemble at dinner time. Took Stillwater's and Ann Arbor's advice and threw in some cooked sweet white corn; plopped spoonfuls of sour cream on surface. No further tweaking necessary. This one goes to my next class potluck.

This dish was easy to make and full of flavor. The tangy lime dressing was delicious. I did however substitute parsley for the cilantro. The meat was rich and flavorful without that packaged taco seasoning flavor. I added a handful of fresh cooked corn to the salad since it is in season. The corn added a nice sweetness to balance the sharpness of the lime dressing. I will make this again and pass along the recipe to friends. I am also going to use the meat recipe next time I make tacos.

I loved this taco salad far beyond the usual version. The dressing was especially fragrant & yummy - although my 7 yr old critic informed me it needed more lime! I didn't think the dressing was great when I tasted it alone but loved it on the salad!

Excellent salad! I crushed a handful of tortilla chips and spread on top of my salad, my wife preferred her chips whole and arranged around the plate. She added a dollop of sour cream on top of her salad, I opted for a few healthy splashes of Tabasco sauce on mine. The one major change I made to this salad was the avocado. I couldn't understand why one would want to use a California avocado when the Florida avocadoes are far superior. I did have to settle for California olives, though.
