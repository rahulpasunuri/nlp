Just made it. It came out wonderfully. I didn't have sweet pepper so I exchanged it with a poblano pepper.When I did that I thought that next time I switch the sausage and bacon with Mexican Chorizo sausage. Great dish as it is though. I think a dollop of sour cream might add to the depth of flavors.

I have eaten (been subjected) to breakfasts in England for many years. I would suggest serving the sausages on the side with a broiled tomato half.
