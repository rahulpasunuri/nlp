I made this sandwich for my family last month, and despite all the wonderful ingredients, we found it to be quite boring. I revamped it last night by doubling the amount of vinaigrette. I marinated the chicken in 1/2 of the vinaigrette for 30 minutes, and the roasted peppers in the other half. I used a stovetop grill pan to grill the chicken, which tasted much better. I also finely grated the parmesan cheese and sprinkled it on the bread slices before placing them under the broiler. I also cut the basil into a chiffonade and added it to the marinated peppers just prior to topping the chicken. Wow! We were all so amazed how the same ingredients when rearranged could make such a difference.

I made this for dinner and found it to be just ho-hum. I used grated parmigiano and didn't have basil so that could have contributed to the outcome. However, the 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and olive oil aren't enough to give this recipe the "wow" flavor as reported by other reviewers.

i make a sandwich similar to this all the time, and people love it. spread a cilantro pesto on the bread, and grill/broil/roast eggplant slices and red onion slices. the sandwich is big, and unforgettable.

Left out the cheese, used mayo flavored with cilantro, chipotle and scallion. Pureed the leftovers and served to my crazy 90 yr-old great-aunt. She thought it needed cumin.

Great meal for Sunday lunch or for a casual lunch for company.

I used mozzarella and the roasted red pepper relish that I had prepared for the goat cheese turkey burgers and it was wonderful and wonderfully easy. I will make this many more times. We had an ice storm today, so I couldn't get out to get the right ingredients. I will be anxious to try it the recommended way and see how that tastes.

Yummy. Didn't have fresh basil so used dry, mixed it with mayo. Turned out great!

This makes a perfect summertime lunch or dinner. My husband, who is extremely picky, went crazy for it. We've made it several times, making changes according to what I have in the kitchen, adding tomato, sauteed onions and/or avocado. A real family favorite and very quick to throw together.

This was suprisingly very good, I substituded green chili for the bell peppers.

We just had surprise company stop by when I was making this for dinner. They, along with the rest of the family, agreed that it was great. The roasted pepper (I used orange since I could not decide between red or yellow) blended well with the cheese and basil. I will definately make this again!!

My network connection died and so I didn't have the recipe while making this and forgot to add the salt and pepper to the vinagrette. Otherwise, though, the sandwich was pretty good and very easy to make. That Parmigiana type of cheese is quite expensive, though! Anyhow, overall this is a great chicken sandwich and I think the Balsamic vinagrette really gives it a great flavor. Worth trying, and probably a lot more flavorful with the pepper, etc.
