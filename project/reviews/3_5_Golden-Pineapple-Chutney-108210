WAY too spicy, and we like spicy. I even omitted the allspice berries entirely, and only used about half of the allspice powder and half of the hot sauce. It wasn't a pleasant heat, it was more of a bite, that totally overwhelmed the fruit. I added more sugar but that didn't help at all. It might be good without any of the spice; otherwise don't waste your time or money on this one. Sorry.

I loved this chutney. I made it as written except I did not add the asian pear. What a wonderful combination of flavors and colors! It does keep a very long time. Great for grilled pork and poultry.

I made this for Easter Dinner to serve with Ham. Very tasty- all the various fruits give it a deep flavor. I omitted the all spice, but I don't think it was missed.
