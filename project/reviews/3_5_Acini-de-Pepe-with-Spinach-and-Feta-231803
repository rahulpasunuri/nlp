This is an excellent side dish. Other commenters are right that lemon juice and toasted pine nuts are a good addition. It's also quite good made with whole wheat pasta (not usually a favorite of ours) and served at room temperature.

Made dish as written, it was just fine. I thought it was missing some high notes, and added juice of 1/2 lemon at the end. Still it is not a spectacular dish rather than a nice accompaniment to a spice entree. I would have added chopped roasted red pepper, lemon and some herbs like oregano or basil.

won't rate the recipe, give I've changed it... but, I threw in some dried cranberries and white beans into the spinach for a quick vegetarian meal. the cranberries added a little sweetness and beautiful color and the white beans made it more filling. highly recommended!

Quick and easy side dish. Prepared recipe as written with orzo. Nicely complimented baked chicken cutlets in a rosemary balsamic marinade.Would definitely make this again.

I made this with fresh farmers market spinach and rotini. I also used sauteed onion - didn't have green onion. Because my spinach was so nice I made it more like a wilted spinach salad: just combined everything (including the cooked pasta) in the frypan with the cooked onions for long enough to wilt the spinach. It was great.

Fabulous. I used capellini which was a great substitute for the orzo. I did need to add a bit more olive oil at the end. Minor details - be sure to salt the garlic/scallion/pepper flakes and again after the spinach is added. I crushed and then sliced the garlic to get nice big pieces that got all soft and caramelized at the edges. My husband and I scarfed down the entire recipe in about 20 minutes, it was really really good.

Wow! It's like an Italian macaroni cheese because it's sooo comfort food. Would be excellent with some grilled Italian sausage. I love the pine nut idea too, will try that one day. I didn't change a thing, except I let the feta come to room temperature so it would spread out amongst the pasta more evenly.

I liked the recipe. Very fast and easy for on-hand ingredients. I added toasted pine nuts and saw another reviewer did as well. It worked well. I will make again.

I made this to accompany the grilled tuscan pepper chicken on the site. It was good, not spectacular. I felt it was missing something and added the juice of a fresh lemon as I was mixing everything together. All in all was yummy with the chicken and was tasty at room temp.

This works - hot - cold or room temperature. Even those who say they don't like feta can't seem to stay away from this dish. I just took it to a pot luck with hope I would have some for lunch tomorrow. Didn't happen.

Very good. I may use less pasta next time, to make it more vegetal, but we liked the flavor and texture very much.

This is a fantastic easy weeknight meal. I took the spinach out of the freezer before I went to work in the morning and the dinner was ready when the pasta was cooked.

Great for a change up in pasta side dishes. This is healthy, easy and works great at a dinner gathering or even a pot luck. Taste great the next day if there is any leftovers.

My first review on epicurious is certainly to rave about this easy and tasty recipe. I didn't use any lemon, but after reading previous reviews, I will try it next time. I was generous with the garlic and had my feta and red pepper flakes on hand to adjust as I ate. Yum!

We've been known to have this twice a week! Ingredients are always on-hand, and it's so quick and yummy. We have used many different kinds of pasta, whatever we have fresh from the market. Yummy with everything from tiny shells to linguine. A great recipe for those who cannot consume dairy but really miss tasty pasta recipes.

Three forks because it is delicious! So glad to have a recipe for the acini di pepe that is not soup. I always have all of these ingredients on hand, which makes it even better for those "what are we having tonight" moments. Reheats well also.

Even in New York City I had a hard time finding acini di pepe but it was worth the search! I've served this dish three times (for different guests) with veal scallopini with olive & sun-dried tomato sauce. (Gourmet, Jan. 07) Delicious combination!

My family loves this just as it is! But I have also made it with shrimp to use as a main course! Yummy

I made this with 1 1/2 cups of bulgur wheat rather than pasta, which obviously is a very different dish, but I highly recommend it. I also used 12 oz. of fresh spinch rather than frozen, and I used the zest and juice of one lemon in the dish rather than as a garnish. It was absolutely delicious, both warm for dinner last night and cold for lunch today.

A perfect side dish to a spicy meal - so many compliments!!

This turned out great. I used spagetini though. I also added toasted pine nuts - yum. I think next time I'll add a touch more of the red pepper flakes. I think it would be good to add in mushrooms as well - maybe next time!

Nothing fancy though it was a decent side dish, a nice variation on other spinach and feta dishes. Next time, I think I'll add a little more feta and spice it up a little more.

I believe I added 2T of lemon juice to the dish as well -- I just like the flavor.

This recipe is a keeper! Only change I made to the recipe was to use brown rice instead of acini di pepe (because I had the rice on hand) -- a very filling and flavorful dish!

Simple and delicious. I used orzo and will definitely make this again!

I like this recipe - its easy and uses ingredients I usually have in the frig. Good side dish that doesn't overpower a good main course.

I'm giving this 4 forks without having changed anything in the recipe. My husband loved it. We made the entire recipe, and had it as a main course after a substantial salad. Still had another serving left over. Used the liquid that drained off the spinach as part of the pasta cooking water.

I was not impressed. I make a somewhat similar dish with orzo, broccoli, feta, kalamata olives, pesto, and red pepper flakes which is much, much better.

Really great. The next time I make it I'll add more feta and red pepper flakes to bump up the flavor a little.

I used quinoa instead of acini de pepe, and it was wonderful! An easy and flavoral dish. Will make again!

tasty as! to boost this "side dish" to a main, i used farfalle pasta instead of acini and tossed with hunks of pan-seared chicken (seasoned with only olive oil, balsamic vinegar and fresh rosemary). oh to die for and very quick. i made it two days in a row.
