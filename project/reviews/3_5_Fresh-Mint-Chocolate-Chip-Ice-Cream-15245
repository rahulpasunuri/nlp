I have made this recipe before (with half the amount of mint) and liked it. This time I added a can of coconut milk instead of cream and omitted the chocolate chips. Everyone agreed, it was delicious and refreshing.

Great recipe, although I altered it a bit. 1.5 cups cream, 1.5 cups 2% milk to make it lighter. Also, muddled the mint in the sugar first, then heated that together with the milk and cream. I used about a cup of mint at most. It wound up with a nice smooth texture and light green color. Mint flavor was distinct and fresh tasting, but not overpowering. I'll definitely make it again!

Delicious. My husband requested that I make it again for his birthday. NOTE: I used half the amount of mint it calls for and did not pack the leaves much. The flavor was still distinct and strong. The full 2 cups might have been overpowering. Also, the ice cream was very rich. You may want to adjust if that is not what you are looking for.

Butterfat content is too high, so I tweaked it. I used 1 c. lowfat milk, 1 c. half and half, 1 c. heavy cream. The fresh mint taste is delightful, and passed the family taste test. Much better than that fake green stuff.

Totally wonderful. Will definately make again. And yes, the best way to add the chocolate is to melt it and then slowly pour it into the freezer as it churns.

Perhaps the reason some of us are getting less than beautiful color from this ice cream is that we are using organic eggs?! Organic eggs have very orange/yellow yolks, so that might be it? I really liked this recipe, but it isn't off the charts so just three forks.

To be clear, this is not for everyone. It is highly unusual and very herbaceous/grassy tasting. It is indeed like pot ice cream, but in a good way. I used about 3/4 of the mint called for. I was worried about the grayish color, so I tried to choose mostly mint leaves that had not discolored yet at all and were bright green, and no stems. They still exuded a very dark gray color once chopped up fine. The cream was enough to dilute it, though, and once it had been churned, it looked pretty much white. it was so fresh tasting and different.

This was wonderful. I made it with 4 cups of half and half, but that was too rich. Next time, I'll make it with 2 cups half and half and 2 cups lowfat milk. I did cook the mixture a long time as the other folks have suggested. Wonderful, wonderful ice cream!

I only did a rough chop of the mint, yet the result was much too minty. I won't be making this again and I doubt we will eat what I made (a rarity in this household).

I am very disappointed in the reviews that this recipe has received. This ice cream was absolutely disgusting- flavor, texture and color were all horrid. It is VERY rich and heavy and an unappetizing grey-green color. The mint is simply too strong (2 cups as per the instructions) and boiling the milk gave it an off-taste. The two eggs make it way too rich and custard-like. The best thing about it were the chunks of high quality dark chocolate that I threw in there. A shame to waste chocolate like that! We chucked it- no one, children or adult, wanted to finish this. As my 6 year old son says, "yuck-a-roo!"

I have made this ice cream many times as it is one of my all time favorites. In fact I may have to stop making it because I eat too much of it, it's that good. I follow the advice of the reviewers, which is to chope the mint coarsely by itself and then adding it to the cream mixture. Then I simmer it for fifteen minutes as per instructions of one of the reviewers. I find that as you simmer it the color changes from a weird color to a beautiful pale green. I use plenty of mint from my garden. I've used less mint than the recipe and also the full two cups of packed mint. All variations are excellent. Adding creme de menthe will completely alter this wonderful subtle ice cream. In fact after the last batch that I made I think I'm going to eliminate the chocolate chips (I use miniature chips). If some one wants chips they can sprinkle it on their own serving, although I like one reviewer's suggestion of drizzling in melted chocolate at the last minute of churning. My ice cream maker does not allow for add ins while churning.

This is not the recipe for you if you are trying to replicate store-bought flavor; but if you're looking for something different it is wonderful! I followed previous reviewers' advice and halved the amount of mint leaves, and it was plenty. Also only did a coarse chop on them and agree that's probably best; and went a couple tablespoons lighter on the sugar and found it just right in terms of sweetness. Also, tried it with semisweet chocolate too and that's just as edible. I've tried 3 varieties of mint: spearmint (usually what's sold fresh in supermarkets), peppermint, and chocolate mint. Spearmint gave the most unusual flavor (but still delicious). My family preferred both the peppermint and chocolate mint batches to the spearmint one, though. Potted mint plants are very easy to buy and almost too easy to grow so there's no reason not to experiment with other varieties.

There's a better way to add chocolate chunks to your ice cream. If you just use normal chips or chunks, the chocolate is often too hard. Ive found that if you melt the chocolate, then drizzle a very thin stream of the warm chocolate into the ice cream during the last possible moments of churning, the chocolate hardens into melt-in-your mouth pieces that are nicely distributed throughout the ice cream.

i am writing a second review because we JUST finished the first batch of this ice cream that i made over a month ago. i have to say... THIS STUFF WAS FABULOUS! it was the perfect texture, and stayed perfect for the weeks that we had it in the freezer. i can't believe that i was underwhelmed by it the first day. so subtle and refreshing... head and shoulders above Ciao Bella's pint! i will make this again and again.

this recipe was good! quite good, in fact... but not exceptional or mind-blowing in any way. i coarsely chopped fresh peppermint and strained it out before cooling the custard. i find the mint flavor to be subtle and pleasant. however, it seems a bit too sweet. next time i may cut down on the cream (add more milk) and use a bit less sugar.

Ok...we were hoping to be one of the positive reviews...we tried everything...this tastes like grass. We had to toss it out, rinse out our mouths, and are now looking for another recipe.

Best mint chip ice cream ever! It's better than Ben & Jerry's! I used 2 cups of mint - muddled with sugar and cooked the custard longer than the recipe indicates per user suggestions. Be sure to cool the cream before adding eggs so they don't scramble!

I used half the mint... but I also 'rough chopped' it with a knife, then muddled it with the sugar. I also added 1 Tbsp. Creme de Menth and 1/2 drop green food coloring. It was very easy to strain the mint. Next time, I'll use 1 1/4 c. mint. It was wonderful.. GREAT texture

This recipe was absolutely disgusting. Ive made this type of ice cream before, and followed the recipe to a T. what we ended up with was a grayish-green mess (very odd color and very unappetizing looking)peppered with odd looking bits of mint leaves. I recommend using only recipes that include peppermint extract, not mint leaves, as both the color and the consistency of this turned out to be completely unappetizing and simply awful!

ATTENTION: This is not the same kind of "mint chocolate chip" ice cream you'd buy at the grocery store. Use a creme de menthe recipe for that. This is REAL MINT ice cream. Do not half the mint. Do not deviate from the recipe. You will be assimilated.

Don't be alarmed by the overwhelming marijuana scent to the ice cream. It does take a few bits each time it is eaten to get over the pot odor, but give it a chance. It is quite delicious! The custard was a brilliant way to make ice cream. The texture was right on! I will be using this as the base for most homemade ice cream from now on out.

I'm definitely making this again, and soon. It was one of the dishes I made for a "food porn" party, and it was quite worthy. I followed others' suggestions of halving the mint, and it was just right. Bright mint flavor, which I balanced with a 70% cacao content chocolate. The combination was just right. I followed the detailed instructions for temps in someone's comments, and the texture was just right.

This recipe is SUBLIME. In fact, in years of Epicurious usage, I think this might be the first time I came back to review the recipe. I was nervous about the eggs in the recipe, was afraid it would taste egg-y... It didn't at all... If anything, I would have used more mint - but it really is excellent as is, has a silky texture. I used high-quality chocolate and organic cream.

Honestly, both my friend and I who made this recipe thought it smelled and tasted more like it was made with pot than mint. We mostly ate the chocolate bits and threw the ice cream part in our bowls away. I wonder why there's such division in liking the recipe or not. Maybe it depends on what kind of mint you use? (We used standard store-bought mint.)

I made this with the recipe recommended by others, with only a cup of mint. My husband didn't kie it at all. He thought it was tasted a little too much like toothpaste, too minty. I loved it, and my kids liked it. I porbably wouldn't make it again though. I'd rather try something else.

I wish I had read the comments before I made the recipe because it was way too minty. Loved the rich custard. Will add less mint and more chocolate next time!

After reading other reviews I decided to adapt a technique from my mint sauce--I cut the mint into the sugar and added it into the milk mixture. I let it steep quite a while. Because my ice cream machine is large, I increased the cream by 1 cup and added an extra egg (I only used the yolks). Fantastic.

I used nonfat evaporated milk instead of heavy cream/milk. The taste was both rich and clean. Wonderful recipe.

This is a good recipe but definitely improved by the comments of other reviewers! I chopped 1 cup of mint roughly in the processor then added it to the milk/cream mixture rather than blending the two together. All of the flotsam strains out and you get less raw mint taste. A bit herbal for sure but pleasant!

Okay we cheated and used extract -- but this is a great BASIC recipe. Used 1 c H&H, 1 c whole milk, 1 c 1/2%, only 1/4 cup sugar and STILL found the result rich and pleasing. Would recommend 1 t mint extract -- 1.5 was too much. Next time I'll try a cup of raspberries and maybe lemon extract. And SOME time, I promise, I'll try the fresh mint! +++++ Update: 10oz frozen raspberries thawed with 1 T sugar, 2 t lemon extract in custard ... exquisite.

I followed, as nearly as I could, the notes of the reviewer from Atlanta, and got a superior result - my boyfriend was in ecstasy over this ice cream! I used perhaps one cup of mint, and I did simmer the mixture for 10 or 15 minutes. At first I could smell what other reviewers referred to as the "grassy" aroma, but the longer it cooked, the mintier it got. I suppose it just needs time to release the mint oils properly. Delicious!

Great recipe: creamy & minty. The 9 year old who helped me make it was worried that it "smelled like spinach," but dont' be put off: even she agreed that it didn't taste that way!

Great recipe even without the chocolate. definitely reduce the amount of mint. Also try changing the ratio of Milk to Cream to more like 50/50 or even 2/3 milk. This will make it lighter and less heavy. When you puree the mint, do it in a blender or food processor WITHOUT the cream. Then add the cream afterwards.

Don't let the bad reviews put you off - it is possible to make some of the most amazing and wonderful ice cream ever using this recipe! You get a "grassy" taste if you don't heat the cream and mint puree long enough. My suggestions: Use one cup of mint only, preferably a "chocolate mint" variety, if you've got it. Liquify it together with the milk. Stir in the cream. SLOWLY bring the cream mixture to 210 degrees, then let the temp drop back to 180-190 and keep it there for about 7 minutes. Then let it cool for 15. When you heat the custard mixture, make sure you do it SLOWLY, bring it to 170 or so, and keep it there (but no higher!!) for a minute or two. Then put the pot in some ice water, and keep stirring. Keep at it until the pot is cool enough so that the custard won't catch if you stop stirring. Strain it, and add a tablespoon of corn syrup (this helps consistency). You should end up with divine tasting ice cream with a perfect texture and pretty green color and is scoopable straight out of the freezer.

This was easy to make and it's delicious. It tastes different from using peppermint extract, but after a quick adjustment, you won't want to go back to the artificial flavor. The ice cream texture is smooth and rich, just like store-bought. Use 1 1/2 cups of mint leaves processed very briefly as suggested by others here. Just freeze any leftover mint leaves for another batch.

YUM! I loved this recipe! I followed the advice of others & used less mint & didn't chop the mint as finely. If you love fresh mint, you'll adore this ice cream. It's the perfect ending to a summer meal!

We thought this was a very good recipe. Delicious mint flavor. However, because of the warnings about the amount of mint, we used only one cup. I think two cups would be too strong and make for an altogether different ice cream, although my 12-year-old son and co-cook wants to try more mint next time, maybe 1 1/2 cups. We also followed the suggestion of not chopping the mint too finely, and all the little pieces strained out. Finally, we added a smidge of green food color to give it the more traditional green color. Very refreshing dessert!

I just made this recipe for a second time and would *highly* recommend one change: blend the milk, cream and mint VERY BRIEFLY so that mint is just ROUGHLY CHOPPED, not pureed. I did this with *fantastic* results. No mint pieces got throught the seive leaving me with a creamy, very pale, icy green delight. (I also substituted skim milk for half of the cream, also with great results.)

This is now my mint-chip ice cream recipe of choice. I found the grassy taste that was present after blending the mint and milk disappeared after I boiled the mixture. Perhaps the previous reviewers didn't boil it long enough? I also used only one cup of mint, and it was quite enough.

Is this recipe a practical joke? To be honest, it is a NEGATIVE four forks, but that was not a choice on the menu. This recipe blows! We definitely concur with the reviewer who called it "salad ice cream": it is nauseatingly plant-like. It will be a hit with cows. One of our party described it as "the roots of a plant fermented in moldy milk." If you really want this leafy flavor, simply go to your front yard and GRAZE AWAY! We added powdered sugar and Godiva liqueur, but even strong alcohol failed to mask the distinctly herb-like taste. The nadir of this experience is the aftertaste. If you begin eating it, never stop: the aftertaste may kill you. It's the only ice cream we've ever had that requires a CHASER. How disappointing to expect a pleasant dessert and instead get THIS HORROR!

I absolutely hated it... using real mint made it taste like eating salad ice cream or something.... it was too organic for lack of a better way to say it. However, oddly enough my guests thought it was great. I guess maybe I'm just too much of a critic.

Delicious! I agree with the previous comments, and when I made it, I only used 1 cup of mint, and it tasted great. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how long this keeps? Between the two of us we don't consume THAT much ice cream, and were wondering if a week or two was too long to keep this ice cream. Otherwise, it was delicious.

After reading the review before I made the ice cream, I went with a cup and a half of mint. It seemed a bit overpowering - and I will probably use only a cup next time. This was the most unusual and wonderful ice cream I have ever made.

I didn't buy enough mint to make two cups of leaves (only 1 cup), so I went with what I had, using a bit less sugar. The ice cream was lovely, with a silky, creamy texture, and a fresh, soft mint taste. It had a lovely sagey green colour (plus a few darker flecks which made it through the sieve). I highly recommend it, but probably would still use only one cup of mint, as it was lovely with just that amount. Now to grow some fresh mint!
