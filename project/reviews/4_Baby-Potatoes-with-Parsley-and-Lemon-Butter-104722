These were a hit & a keeper; my husband said I want to see these on the table again. I made them exactly as written except I cut the tiny red potatoes in half so that the cut side could caramelize & get all brown & crispy, they wont do that if the potatoes are completely covered in skin over the whole surface. I will experiment once in the future & try adding garlic as the other reviewers had done. I think that might be gilding the lily on an already perfect recipe but Ill try it someday because Im curious.

Fantastically easy to make. I used regular potatoes, but cut them about the same size of baby potatoes. Then I parboiled it only for 10 minutes. Added garlic, this added some kick and used an entire lemon juice. Lime works out just as well.

all I can say is WOW! Subtle lemony flavour, great recipe. Although I did add 2 cloves of garlic as other recommended (cause I LOVE garlic) and we used just Yukon Gold potatoes...

I love lemon, so I added a bit more than what the recipe called for. Delicious. Such an easy quick recipe, that dresses up a boring side dish of potatoes. Served with a little sour cream on the side. They were a complete hit!!

Quick, easy and yummy. I added a couple of pressed garlic cloves. I served it with an herb rubbed Sirloin Tip Roast and some sugar snap peas. Fabulous!

Very easy to make. Nice side dish. Enjoyed by all. I used baby dutch potatoes which cut down on cooking time even more. I will be making this often.

This is a really great potato recipe. I substituted chives for the parsley and lime juice for the lemon juice and peel. It turned out delicious. I served it with balsamic roasted carrots and broccoli with garlic and parmesan cheese, both from this website. I will definitely make this again.

This is a "keeper" for sure ! Everyone RAVED over the potatoes !!

This dish is delicious with most everything, and easy to prepare. Definitely try adding a clove or two of garlic and cutting the potatoes in half. They seem to absorb more flavor that way.

Made these last night to go with Asian Flank Steak from this site - excellent! I changed the recipe slightly (which I think is a pet peeve of many on this site). I added fresh asparagus to the boiling potatoes for 4 minutes, then continued with the recipe.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! The potatoes are extremely quick and easy to make and pair well with most any main course. I cut back on the amount of butter (for the health conscious, I think olive or grapeseed oil would work well, too). The crushed garlic, as suggested by other reviewers, is a nice addition. If you don't happen to have a fresh lemon on hand, lemon pepper can easily be subsituted (although you'll want to be sure to adjust or even omit the salt and pepper called for in the recipe).

I'm always looking for tasty and easy ways to dress up potatoes. These potatoes would go with most anything. I like that most of the recipe can be done ahead of time.

We loved this recipe. We cut the potatoes in four, and the potatoes absorbed the flavor beautifully. Thumbs up! We made it ahead, and put it in corning ware and just kept it warm.

Wonderful dish equally at home in the kitchen and dining room! And so easy to make--ahead of time for company or at the last minute for just the two of us . Another thing, the ingredients are all every day staples--no shopping required. I grow parsley outside my porch, but recently new yardmen dug it up(thought it was weeds!) so at the last minute I substituted parsley flakes and my husband never noticed the difference. I asked!!! Thank you.

Had it tonight..served with chic. piccata and made a quick dinner for guests..had the potatoes all ready and just tossed them into the skillet for a couple of minutes before serving. Only used the red potatoes and did cut them in half before I boiled them. Would do again. Good company recipe because I was able to do them ahead and still serve a hot dinner.

Simple, quick and tasty. A good side dish for a heavy meat entree. A good make ahead recipe if you're having company. The potatoes did not absord the other flavors so next time I will peel a strip of skin around the middle of each potato or slice them in half.

This dish was so easy to prepare. It was the perfect side dish for baked salmon and asparagus. My boyfriend and I are big lemon lovers so,naturally I had to make this. He liked it so much he had it for leftovers the next day(and his company provides catered lunches!) I used a combination of small red and white potatoes. I will definately make this again.

This dish was wonderful. What a great side for most main dishes. Very easy. Do the potatoes ahead of time and then you just have to heat them up in the pan before serving.

I love this recipe which I make, a little bit differently, by adding crushed garlic, it makes it even tastier.
