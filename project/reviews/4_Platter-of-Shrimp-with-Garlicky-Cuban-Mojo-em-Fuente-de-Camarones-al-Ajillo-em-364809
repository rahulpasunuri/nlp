I would give 5 forks if I could. The best shrimp I've made or eaten.

This is absolutely going into my regular lineup for easy weeknight meals and shrimp recipes. I gave 3 forks instead of 4 because I modified the cooking method. I did not butterfly and grill the shrimp, instead I followed another reviewers method and poached the shrimp. I boiled the shells with a bay leaf for about 15 minutes, discarded the solids and used the broth to poach the shrimp. Delicious! I made as an appetizer for a small dinner party, but I'll make it again and use the shrimp in a main meal. The shrimp and sauce would make an excellent addition to a salad, or a pasta dish.

Very tasty, I added cilantro as suggested by wallselm from san antonio, it was a good idea. I also butterflied the shrimp; but instead of grilling, I poached them with bay leaves,salt, lemon and garlic. Would make it again with a little less garlic. The recipe does make a lot, I have left overs, should add egg and parmasan and call it a Caeser salad dressing.

excellent! i would add cilantro for color and zing. when i butterflied shrimp, they stayed attached at tail and top, but came apart in middle, so i tucked tails in opening - perfect! "grilled" them on my panini press for 3 mins, no need for 5. served over brown rice with blanched broccolini, poured sauce over all. Garlic is basically raw -- not ideal for a first date.

I just love this recipe. It's easy, delicious and versatile. The mojo can be used with a variety of fish...even chicken. I especially love it because it feels like you're being "bad" but, really, it's pretty healthy.

I could drink the mojo it's so delicious, I also used the leftovers on top of salmon which was tasty! Quick and easy dinner for a work night.

If you love garlic you will love these! My husband wants them at least once a week. Great with summer cocktails.

I used part of the mojo as a marinate for the shrimp as suggested in the reviews. The mojo was tasty but I wasn't crazy about the whole dish. I don't know if it was the fact that I purchased a super large shrimp (butterflied it was like a baby lobster) that affect it the taste. I think I would try it with a smaller shrimp next time. overall it was just good, not outstanding.

Much better than boiled shrimp with cocktail sauce! I don't think you need to butterfly the shrimp, if you are short on time, just skewer them and grill. The dipping sauce is great, but it makes a lot and you won't even use half the amount.

Fast and good and sure to become a staple. One thing I'd change, I'd make the oil for the mojo just less than 1/4 cup. Also, the sauce has much better flavor at room temp/a little cold.

Very good, although rather than a dipping sauce I used the mojo as a marinade.
