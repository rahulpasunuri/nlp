YUM!! These look wonderful! These will make a great House Warming gifts and Thank You gifts! Im always looking for different ways to treat my friends and clients. I looked online and found a company that sells these polka dot pastry boxes that are so cute! They will make the gift complete. http://www.boxandwrap.com/bakerydots.html

as far as the confectionery sugar.... the Hungarian Walnut Chocolate Torte recipe has a recipe to make your own confectionery sugar for Pesach...

There is confectioner's sugar available for Pesach -- it uses potato starch instead of corn starch. Soy milk, OTOH, is not kosher for Pesach (not for Ashkenazim, at least).

Not a review either but an answer to help make the recipe acceptable for Passover. Don't use the version with confectioner's sugar but use the other coatings. Also, you can use other types of 'cream' instead of dairy cream. I'm allergic to dairy so would substitute a 'cream' made from coconut or soy.

Ok, so this isn't actually a review, but I really like that bird dish featured in your photo. Where can I get it?

Technically, this is not acceptable for Passover. The confectioner's sugar contains cornstarch which is not kosher for Passover. Also, because it contains cream, it would not be served with a meat meal.
