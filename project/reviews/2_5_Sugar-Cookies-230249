I made two batches and still got less than 30 cookies. People's review of too dry are acurate, I made ladies fingers for Halloween, and VERY difficult to roll out. I was successful and the cookies looked great, but the baking powder and salt really noticable, I think more so than the "sugar" part.

Everyone else was right. Too dry and crumbly, impossible to roll out, and very little of it. I tried to move it into a pan to make shortbread (as one reviewer recommended), but it crumbled beneath my fingertips. Not worth making, but if you did...place the dough directly into greased, small shallow bowl and press for one large cookie cake. Just trying to make it salvageable.

This recipie was no good at all. The dough was extremly dry, and it DEFINETLY doesnt make 30 cookies. I made 14! And do not roll the dough into balls, as I did. They do not cook all the way through, taste disgusting. I might make these again, but I will definetly take a few more hint from the reveiws!

these cookies were the best! Didn't get quite as much out of the dough as said but were absolutely wonderful! Added a little more butter but other than that they were quick, easy and delicious.

This recipe was so dry. Also there was no way this recipe made 30 cookies they must had to be the size of a quarter. We were only able to make 14 cookies. My children were very disappointed.

This was the nastiest recipe I have ever tasted. I threw up!

This recipe was so dry I couldn't even roll out the dough. I'll try again because they tasted okay, but not the best sugar cookie recipe out there...

I thought this was an easy, quick recipe for making cookies with my kids. Low fat and tasty. I'd add some lemon juice or zest for some added zing next time. It was an easy dough to roll out and make holiday cookies.

change the recipe completley: it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me... combine all ingredients in a bowl, and don't add vanilla extract. stir vigorously until crumbly and then compress into a disk. refridgerate, bake, and youi're done. it tastes like shortbread. this was a product of a hectic hankering for cookies.

When I made this I read the instructions wrong and ended up putting in 1/2 T of vanilla. The dough was brown but the cookies tasted really good. I did not make the icing.

Too much icing. Too few cookies. Made 20 cookies - not 30. Not even close.
