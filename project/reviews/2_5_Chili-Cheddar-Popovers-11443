These were just ok, I've had much better popovers. However, if you're needing to make some popovers quickly, these are the ones to make.

Very easy to make using ingredients I had on hand. I was afraid the chili powder was going to be overwhelming, but it wasn't. Next time I might add a little more cheese and something savory like onion or garlic powder.

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make and delicious. I was out of chili powder, so I left it out and it was great.
