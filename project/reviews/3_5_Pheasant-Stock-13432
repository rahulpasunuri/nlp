I cooked it my big webber kettle using coal spreaders and a pan under the meat during the BBQ. The results were outstanding. I also added soaked apple wood wood chips for another dimension. Do not over the meat. 45 to 50 minuets using a full chimney of white hot coals.

How about telling us how long to cook the stock for? I let it simmer for 2 hours, sit overnight, skimmed off fat and then simmered for another hour, but it seemed to me that perhaps it should have been longer. Also, my pheasants came with giblets so I threw those in too, fishing out the livers after they had cooked through and making a delicious chopped liver spread with them.
