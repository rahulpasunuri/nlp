Simple and superb. Not sure why--maybe I had particularly good, fresh green beans, or maybe I've always overcooked green beans. The short blanch was perfect.

I LOVE tarragon, but this salad is a little bland. It is much taster the next day, but it still needs something, and I am at a loss as to what. I might try it again if I can figure it out.

i have made this one twice now and i like it a lot, very mellow and fresh-tasting. it doesn't hurt to add some extra flavors to make it more robust, though. i experimented a bit & added sweet corn and some japanese rice seasoning to the 2nd batch. it turned out great!

I thought this was good and I'd make it again. It's a nice side dish that is a little different. We've been trying to eat more brown rice, and this was a nice opportunity.

I've made this a few times, but not as a cold salad. I just used dried tarragon as well. I think it is better once it sits for a bit.

i substituted chicken broth for half the water to add flavor; also used watercress instead of tarragon and added chopped cashews ... the whole thing turned out great; definitely not bland!

Bland? Don't think so. The olive oil and terragon blended beautifully with the rice and beans for a very nutty flavor.

This was not a bad dish, it was just very bland. I would not make it again, it was very easy though.
