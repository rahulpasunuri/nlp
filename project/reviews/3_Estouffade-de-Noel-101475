I had never made Estouffade de Noël and made this for dinner guests. This recipe is a bit vague but if you're a cook it's quite easy and delicious. Followed it to the letter and everyone raved. Served it with carrots vichy and herbed whipped potatoes.

A delicious and wonderful classic dish that is perfect for do-ahead dinner parties. I added mixed sauteed mushrooms consisting of fresh crimini, shiitake, portabella and oyster mushrooms.
