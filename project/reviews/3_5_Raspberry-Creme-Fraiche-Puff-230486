Could not find creme fraiche so whipped some sweet cream. Anything made with raspberries is a winner in my book.

It was so tasty. I made it for my boyfriend and family. They were raving about how good it was!

The simplicity of this recipe demands the best quality raspberries you can find. It also lends itself to substitution... if you can't find perfect raspberries... then blueberries, strawberries, or blackberries are a better choice. You're really show-casing the fruit. I've made this numerous times, or used the recipe for inspiration for other fruits, flavored cremes, etc. A great basic recipe!

Recipe is just too light the way it is & I felt it needed some ump...so I made a pastry cream and then folded the whip cream into it. Also, I could not find fresh raspberries so I used frozen and this worked out fine. I made a much larger version too to feed 6. My Puff Pastry brand (Tenderflake) comes with 2 squares so I used them both. Rolled them each out and cut each of them into 6 rectangles. I forked 6 of them so they would not rise for the bottoms of the dessert and left the other pastry as is for the tops. I did decorate the tops with some leftover pastry, simple criss crosses and then brused them with egg wash. Very quick, simple and elegant. My guests raved & I will definately make this again. I call my version, Napoleans.
