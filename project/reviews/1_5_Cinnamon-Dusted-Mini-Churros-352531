I had fun making these! They were very quick to make and easy clean up. I got great feedback from the party I made them for too. I wasn't able to use the star tip or real pastry bag but it ended up fine. They looked more like funnel cake but still delicious.

Good taste, but oil temp is very hard to control. Probably over browned a bit.

I used a professional fryer so I know I had consistent temperature oil and these still didn't turn out well. They were very dry.

BAD RECIPE

do not make these churros without professional help or experience. These churros taste BAD and they burn very easily when you depp fry them.
