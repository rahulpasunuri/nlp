Made this for the Superbowl and it was so good we called it "Snack Crack". Made a double batch of Pretzel Crunch and mixed with one bag of original Chex Mix and one bag of halved mini Reese's Pieces (they come already unwrapped). This will be our standard snack mix from now until forever.

EXCELLENT! added some chopped up reese's peanut butter per the same recipe in food and wine (after the mix cools). next time, will probably add some salted nuts as well. recipe is a keeper!

excellent! read the same recipe in food and wine - in which they added some reese's peanut butter cups cut up after mix cools. so good. next time will probably add some salted nuts to it as well. simple to make and a crowd pleaser.
