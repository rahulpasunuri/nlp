One of the best buttermilk biscuit recipes I've found. Just be sure to keep your butter well chilled and don't over-work the dough--I didn't roll mine, but just cut the dough into pieces and plopped it on the pan. Also, they took more than 20 minutes... more like 30.

I use this as launch pad for various biscuit experiments. For the brief period of time my favorite grocer had ramps, I made them per the recipe. I've substituted scallions/black pepper; leeks/coriander; and today, I was inspired to do a lemon zest/rosemary/cracked black pepper combo just because that's what I had on hand (and didn't have time to make the focaccia I wanted to with lemon/rosemary/pepper). In 15 short minutes, taste-tasting. I expect they'll be fine. I don't think there's too much liquid or that the dough is too sticky. I break up the butter into the flour with my hands and keep it fairly coarse; 3/4 cup buttermilk is the right amount to bind the dough. I also use a scoop - don't ever roll my biscuits as I don't like over-working the dough. I like the butter to have the space to explode, together with the baking powder, unconstrained and all rustic looking. AND its less to clean up.

Used 1 cup chopped leaks instead of the ramps and everyone was happy. If you use two large metal spoons to mix the dough and then use the spoons to deposit it directly on the floured surface, you avoid the sticky texture that comes from over handling. Just sprinkle a little flour on top before you start rolling out the dough and you are good to go.

I used about 1/3 to 1/2 cup buttermilk. The dough was easy to work with and the biscuits were delicious. I think 3/4 cup buttermilk is too much.

We've had ramps in our Indiana woods for years, but I never knew what to do with them. Imagine my delight when I opened the April Bon Appetit! We tried these biscuits and they were great; needed extra flour for a workable dough, but I think I'd use grated parmesan next time. Just delicious!

For the people who did not (or do not) know what ramps are: Do you not get the magazine? The recipe is from an article... on RAMPS! And it's not pretentious - that's what they're called!!

These were a big hit but I agree that the dough was very sticky and hard to work with. After I baked them I sliced them in half and added a little ham for a great Easter hors d'oeuvre. For those complaining about the ramps: this recipe was from a multi-page article in the April 09 magazine that explained what ramps are, how to find them, use them, etc.

I was pleasantly surprised to see this recipe just a few days after noticing how well the ramp in my own garden is doing. I found the dough was came out much too sticky in the batch I made, but otherwise thought they made a nice snack with a small chunk of blue cheese and some camembert. Next time I think I'd add a few things to give them a bit more zing, though. Not quite sure that yet (bacon or ham bits? parmasan slivers?), though.

We have ramps in our local grocery store in the spring. They are labeled ramps. If one would Google "ramp food" there are plenty of sources of information.

It does seem pretty silly to not tell us what ramps are since they are not easily available. Just use green onions with a small amount of chopped garlic to get a similiar flavor if you can't find ramps. Wish we could find ramps here in Napa!

I agree with EVERYONE who said to use the word "ramps" was pretentious and silly. For cryin' out loud! You can't find them in a store labeled "ramps," so to use the word in a recipe and not include the definition was AUREATE. (LOOK IT UP)

When I lived for a short time in WV Ramps grew wild on the mountain side. They a like a very strong scallion. Too strong for my taste. This recipe is great with scallions.

No need to feel sheepish, tetoncook. You're like the one kid in the classroom who has the guts to put up his hand and ask the teacher, while the rest of us hide our heads in the textbook. I, too, had NO idea what a ramp was ... so thanks for being the brave one!

Not impressed at all. Also used leeks but everything elso was the same. Just plain boring

Would have been nice for the recipe to say what a "ramp" is and/or give possible substitutions. Really, who on earth has ever heard of a "ramp"???

Simplystace - thank you so much for the wisdom. Sheepishly, tetoncook

A ramp, is a wild leek that grows abundantly here in Northern Michigan. They are spicy and somewhat garlic like in flavor. It is a favorite spring time activity for our family to forage for them to make soups, quiche, tarts and now we'll try them in biscuits. Get some if you can! Happy Spring!!!

Terrific! Who can resist a hot biscuit & the coriander gave it a nice surprising twist. Without the coriander, they reminded me of your recipe for Buttermilk Biscuits with Green Onions, Black Pepper, & Sea Salt. We did not cook an Irish dinner this year, opting instead to dine out. So I made these to go with the Irish dinner I made belatedly at home yesterday. I too have been a home cook for 41 yrs. & never heard of a ramp either, but assumed it was similar to a green onion. I went to the Epicurious dictionary & typed it in....bingo..... similar to a green onion, scallion, or leek, just a little more intense.

I've been a cook for almost 30 years - what the heck is a ramp?

These were the best biscuits I have ever made or tasted. I admit I did not have any fresh ramps so I substituted an equal amount of fresh leeks. When I get my hand on some ramps this is the first recipe I will try them in! I also ground my coriander in a molcajete as I usually do so I did not try the plastic bag method recommended here.
