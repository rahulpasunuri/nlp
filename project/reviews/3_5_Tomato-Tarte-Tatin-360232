Quite simply the best tarte tartin there is and especially when local tomatoes are at their best. My guests are often amused and confused when I serve this Guessing Game tarte and they argue over the fact that these are tomatoes.

Really easy to make. I have done this at least six time now all to raving comments, everyone wants the recipe. I learned the hard way, when it says medium heat for the stovetop cooking, keep it at medium to medium-low. This recipe is well worth the time invested.

Made this recipe for the first time last night and after 10 years on epicurious...this is my first review. It was that good. I'm not a huge tomato fan, and desser for me=chocolate. I was not dissapointed by a long shot. It was perfect, sweet, and the recipe was easy to follow. Messy, took a little bit, but it was fantastic!

I've made this twice and to great effect. The first time, I did not have the heat high enough and it took considerably longer to caramelize the sugar. The point to take away from this is that the final product definitely did not have a tomato taste - more like a sweet plum. The second time, I used a higher heat for caramelization and found that some tomato taste lingered, although both of my step- sons who aren't fond of tomatoes enjoyed the dessert and requested more. I did not use whipped cream with either attempt but will in the future. We consumed it more as a dessert pizza - a very innovative dish.

Amazing! Think tomato candy. Best dessert I've made in a long time.

I was intrigued by the sound of this recipe (tomatoes for dessert!), but was a little wary of the love it or hate it response by the reviewers. I brought this tart and a back up dessert (just in case!) to a dinner party. Turns out, I didn't need the back up dessert. Everyone loved the tart. The caramel had an excellent vanilla flavor, and the tomatoes took on an unexpected spiciness. The whipped cream added another unusual, but very tasty, twist to the dish. I would definitely make this again, but would reserve it for adventurous, food-loving guests.

Wow, this is really an extraordinary dessert! Very impressive and very easy to make. No way did it taste like tomatoes -- the tomato finally used like a fruit! I did have a problem getting it to release from the pan, so it was more 'rusic' looking that the photo in the magazine -- but it didn't detract from the taste. Will definitely make again.

Very strange recipe. We had to make it because you never know...uhhh.... but now we do. Tomatoes have no place in desserts. As an appetizer or light lunch, this would be good with a little tweeking. As a dessert, it is just too weird. It still tasted like tomatoes. I kept thinking it needed more cheese. There are too many good dessert options to bother with this.

Oh yeah! I made this with tomatoes from our garden and penzys vanilla. OMG. Sweet, interesting, with lovely vanilla scent. This was fabulous, interesting and well worth the time and trouble. If I have garden tomatoes, I would not hesitate to make this for any guest or family member.

This is great fun to make. It was a little sweet but my family was very pleased, especially my little tomato-hater. She said, "now this is the way to eat tomatoes". It was fun to listen to everyone guess what they were eating, they called out every red fruit you can imagine.

Made this with Roma tomatoes from the farmer's market. I did peel, seed and core my tomatoes and they held up beautifully to the cooking process. I made it exactly as described except I added a pinch of Kosher salt with the vanilla. Rave reviews and I will DEFINITELY make this again.

We made this on a cottage vacation for lunch and cut back substantially on the sugar (maybe a scant 1/4 cup) and added some rosemary. The tomatoes were amazing the way they caramelized in the pan. Will make again for a light lunch w a nice salad of mixed greens, blueberries and blue cheese. Delish.

The picture here is not the one which accompanied the recipe in Bon Appetit magazine. This one was taken during prep while the one in the magazine was of the finished product.

3 forks for novelty - nice way to use summer tomatoes. However, it was way too sweet! I would cut down sugar to 1/2 cup at the most, and then add a little lemon juice or a swig of balsamic with the vanilla. It was definitely different and visually appealing. Also, it was pretty easy with the puff pastry

I scored a bunch of home grown tomatoes from my boss, figured this would be a great dish to use them up. i was wrong. The tomato lover in me hated this. The describtion really says it all sweet with that clean tomato taste. It sounds good but it is just wrong. This is one thing though you have to try and make your own opinion on it. You will either hate it or love it. For me i would rather make a tomato salsa or brushetta with goat cheese than waste 8 large tomatoes on this.

This was extraordinarily fun to make, and to entertain my dinner guests with guessing what fruit the tomatoes were: I felt a little lost when trying to figure out just how much of the tomato to remove, but removing only the seeds (not the inner core) is the way to go. I had no problems with presentation; it looked beautiful. But the picture just looks like the 1st stage of preparation of the dish. You have never tasted tomatoes like this.

The taste was interesting but it looked nothing like the picture. I used very ripe tomatoes and they turned into mush.But everyone thought I should make it again. I thought maybe someone else might have some hints to make it look more appealing.

I thought "tomato dessert-- yuck!" but had to try it. It looked exactly like the picture when it was done, but I thought "gee, I wish those were plums!" When I tasted it I didn't like it. With that said, my husband really liked it and my mother (who is an excellent baker and very candid in her reviews of my baking) LOVED it. She said "what a genius mind thought of this!" It was definitely fun to try!

Very easy to make. It sounds odd, but it's like sweet summer flavors on pastry dough. We didn't tell one of guests what it was made out of and had him guess - he was very surprised it was tomatoes. Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the picture but it was still a nice presentation in an artisanal kind of way. It's another way to use up an excess of tomatoes from your garden. I will make it again this summer.

The only reason I gave this 4 forks is because I couldn't give it 5.

This is amazingly delicious. One of the best desserts I have ever had.
