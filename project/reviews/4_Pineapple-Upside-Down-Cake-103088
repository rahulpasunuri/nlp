Delicioso!! I'm a fan of cardamom so I followed the recipe as written and I was not disappointed. Easy to make and to eat! I used canned pineapple and it came out fine. I will make this again.

Aaack! I'm one of those people -- ! Didn't have rum so I swapped in half as much balsamic vinegar. Cake was fabulous. I did heed the comments of prior cooks, and cut the sugar back to half a cup. Was so pretty and delicious. Will make it again soon.

I cannot rave enough about this cake! First of all, everything I ever made from this Website and from Bon Apetite and Gourmet has never failed. Second, I always read the reviews and take comments into consideration. In this recipe, I reduced the Cardamom amount in half - only used one and a half teaspoon, and it came out delicious. I would like to note that I purchased individual pineapple upside down cake muffin tins, and originally made another cake from a recipe I found on allrecipes, but it came out more like a corn bread consistency. I didn't have fresh pineapple so used canned, and I didn't have dark rum so I used coconut flavored mini bottle of jamaican rum. Couldn't taste it in the final product so I'll remember to buy dark rum next time. Note that this makes enough for 8 individual cakes. I can't say enough about the cake, it was so delicious and the taste of it was sublime. Will defintely make again!

I made this recipe yesterday. Like many others, I omitted the cardamom (except as a garnish). Mine was also cooked at around 30-35 minutes. Was intensely sweet, so you can probably cut back a smidge on the sugar in the cake (although I haven't tested this). Overall very nice recipe.

Fair waring on this one: I bakes using all 3 teaspoons of cardamon. It was too overbearing. Everything else about the cake was sublime!, Light, yet moist and firm cake, gorgeous caramel rim and lovely, sweet fruit. I used 2/3 dark sugar to 1/3 light sugar for a richer caramel. I might consider a tsp of cardamon and one teaspoon or cardamon next time.

The cake topping was very sweet. I followed the proportions stated and used the iron skillet for caramelizing the sugar and baking the cake. The texture and turn-out from the pan were lovely, but the brown sugar topping didn't get quite to the deep flavor and nearly crunchy finish I'd hoped for, despite cooking and baking the full times suggested. Next time I'll cut back to 1/2 cup each brown sugar and butter for the topping. The suggestion to use o.j. in place of pineapple juice worked out great, since I used fresh pineapple. I used regular rum and 2 tsp. cardamom, and the cake flavor was delicious, moist, and subtle.

Yummy! This was very moist - and mine was done all the way through at just 30 minutes, so watch it! I made it with fresh pineapple, used buttermilk instead of pineapple juice (may help with moistness), and had hazelnut-infused rum on hand, so used that. Added pecan halves to the pineapple topping and it turned out wonderful!

Due to daughter's allergies, I modified the recipe a bit to make it dairy-free and soy- free. I also used a regular cake pan and a lot of cinnamon and allspice (instead of cardamom). Delicious!!! Even my 3-yr old couldn't resist. Full review at http://nomyumfree.com

My husband requested a Pinapple Upside-Down cake for his birthday. I found this recipe and since I had all the ingredients on hand it was a no-brainer. It came out FANTASTIC!!! So moist, not to sweet and hit the spot. He loved it. I used a bunt pan since my cast iron skillet is very large. Definately will use this recipe again and again and again.

Have made this recipe for years now. It is usually hailed as the best pineapple upside down guest have ever eaten. Never use the rum, as I am sober, but sure it would be great added in. Half the cardamom is fine with us. 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans in the topping are cool too. Use vanilla you are sure of...lots of market brands are recipe killers.

Super-b! Made this for my daughters b-day cake (by request), loved loved loved the addition of the cardamom.The cake was moist and delicious. I doubled the recipe for the cake as I had a larger cast iorn pan but only increased the ingredients for the topping by 1 1/2 and it turned out perfect. Will make this my staple Pineapple Upside Down Cake.

Everyone that tastes this cake loves it! After making it several times, I have decided that 1 tsp of cardamon is enough for me and that canned pineapple rings work fabulously if you don't have fresh on hand. Also, the pineapple rings are easier to place and make a really pretty presentation. Use good quality vanilla...it really makes a difference...and watch the time in the oven. 45 minutes is too long in my oven as it was perfect after only 30 minutes. Make it! You'll love it!

Nothing special at all. Topping was too much and too moist/wet. Cake was heavy and dry. Not sweet enough. Made exactly as written.

When rating, I only like to rate it against other of the same thing. So, I am rating this only against other pineapple upside down cakes I have made/tried. I made modifications, but kept the base recipe the same. I used a bunt pan, as I didn't have a cast iron skillet and thought it would look festive. I used canned pineapple, looking for the same taste I grew up with. I used a 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 t. allspice blend instead of cardamom. Small, to taste, modifications. This cake had a *perfect* crumb, just like I remember my mothers cake to have. And the right amount of crunch/bite to the caramel topping. Though, I should have let it simmer in the pan maybe a couple minutes longer for that true crunch. For the bunt pan, I simmered the butter/brown sugar in a pan stovetop first, then transfered to the bunt pan. I baked as directed.

I love this recipe! I did tweak it a bit because I didn't have vanilla so I used a vanilla liquer called Navan and I didn't have dark rum but I did have a coconut rum. I also cut back on the cardamon to 1 tsp. (I'm not very fond of the spice). I used a 1/4 Cup of the pineapple juice from the canned pineapple and to make up the 1/2 Cup, I used an OJ/Mango juice I had in frig....very yummy! Next time I will use more of the liquer & rum!!! When done, I sprinkled with Amaretto (as recommended by a reviewer). Again.....very, very yummy. This recipe is a keeper, for sure! Next time I hope to make it with a fresh pineapple.

This is a great recipe: delicious and simple. I've made it three times and everyone loves it. I never seem to have pineapple juice so just use OJ instead.

Made this as a treat for my Dad, its his fav. Loved the addition of the rum. Didn't have a skillet, made the topping in a pot and then transferred to a 9" cake pan. See my full review at: http://thebakerwithin.blogspot.com/2011/05/5050-weekend.html

This was fantastic. I opted for two teaspoons of cardamom and my wife loved it though I would have been just as happy cutting it by half. I did add one teaspoon of almond extract as well which made everything wonderfully aromatic. Next time, I may consider sprinkling the top with Grand Marnier or Amaretto rather than rum just to see how it turns out. Like others, I've also noticed the use of crushed pineapple instead of sliced as an interesting variation. Finally, I had a similar skillet-based recipe in a restarant, with it being served in a smaller skillet and the batter only being poured in the center 50% of the skillet. It is then served with a surrounding of pineapple chunks bubbling in the sugar/butter mixture. Divine.

Made this for Easter dinner for a friend who's been begging for years...I didn't have cardamom on hand so used cinnamon and used orange juice instead of pineapple juice (again, what I had on hand). Used 1 1/2 C. sugar to compensate for the sweetness of the OJ and it turned out perfectly! Love this recipe. My new favorite! Next time I'll have cardamom and give that a go, but cinnamon is a nice substitute. Will absolutely make again and again and again!

O Boy! Did I have my way with this recipe! I used almond and oat flour (save 1/4 cup of wheat), half the sugar and only one egg. My mother used to make this a lot with canned pineapple (and maraschino cherries!). I had a fresh pineapple that was on it's way to past ripe. I macerated some of the fruit for the juice and chunked the rest. For the topping I only used 1/2 stick of butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar, as I only have an 8" cast iron frying pan. IT TASTES GREAT!!!

Quite lovely. Made this for my husband's birthday cake (just after the holidays and couldn't face anything with frosting without groaning). Went over really well. Used two teaspoons of the cardamom and it didn't overpower the cake, but was rather subtle. My only criticism on the recipe is regarding the measurements for the butter. Preference would have been for proper measurements, not 3/4 of a sick of butter. When not working from a stick, makes additional thinking needed (again, after the holidays, can't really do without groaning).

Loved this cake. I did not think it was too sweet like some others have said. I only used one teaspoon of cardamom and thought it was just right. I made it in my 10 inch non-stick pan and it worked perfectly. It flipped nicely after the designated five minutes. I will definitely make this again. It was moist and flavorful and delicious!

I've always made the old-fashioned Better Homes and Garden cookbook recipe that calls for the canned rings of pineapple. The fresh pineapple is much nicer, less sweet. I don't care for the cardamom, certainly not 2-3tsp. of it. I used 1 tsp, and that was plenty for my palate. The caramelly bottom was gooey and yummy in my cast iron skillet.

Rating: 4
Excellent. The tastiest thing about this is the carmelized brown sugar. Make sure you stir with the butter for the 4 minutes, as it really sets this upside-down cake apart from the rest. I also skipped the batter here and just mixed up a vanilla cake from Trader Joe's. I also cut up a whole, not half a fresh pineapple. This got rave reviews at a party. Someone brought the run-of-the-mill canned pineapple upside-down cake, but mine was devoured. They tasted completely different.

Substitute peaches for pineapple. Use a deep (2") 12" wide skillet. Use 1/4 lb. butter & 1 cup brown sugar. Double the remaining ingredients and bake 55 min. Still working on this one, close to perfection. Need to get the the brown sugar topping a little more crispy. R Bowin, Albion, NY

I love rich desserts but this one was too much. I usually don't make comments on recipes in this case I felt compelled because the topping was too sweet even with the tartness of fresh pineapple. The topping could easily be cut in half. I made it to bring to work and share, everyone enjoyed and the only upside is that no one could really eat more than a sliver of this cake so it served a lot of people.

Excellent! I followed the recommendation for 1 1/2 teaspoons of cardamom, otherwise followed directions as written. I did not have the proper pan so I baked it in a springform pan and it came out perfectly and deliciously. I also put a raspberry in the center - yum!

This is a really good recipe - not 4 forks as I save that for fabulous. But didn't use the rum - subbed a little OJ. Also didn't use cardamom but added 1/2 tsp of chinese 5 spice instead. FYI I baked in convection oven and it was done at 350 in about 25 minutes.

This cake was a smash hit. DEFINITELY a "make-again". I only had an 8 inch cast-iron skillet so I reduced all ingredients by a third; except the rum of course - that I doubled. ;) And the cardamom - I used 1-1/4 tsp and it was perfect. Nicely spiced but didn't overwhelm the other flavours. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I puréed some leftover pineapple in lieu of juice. I did find it difficult to overlap the 3/8" slices of pineapple. Maybe it was the smaller pan or maybe I'll slice them more thinly next time. No real problems getting the cake out of the pan either. The only thing I wish I had done different was to reduce the cooking time appropriately to the smaller pan. But that was my fault.

This is a most excellent and delicious recipe. I only used 2 teaspoons of ground cardamom and the spice wasnot too strong. I also substituted fine pineapple chunks in place of the water in the cake mix and it turned out excellent.

This was my first time making Pineapple Upside Down Cake and I must say this recipe is absolutely amazing. I made a recipe and a half of cake batter because I was using a 12 inch cast iron skillet and it worked fine...Nothing dripped over and burned and the cake released and came out clean. I rated this a 3 because my only issue with the cake is that the butter/brown sugar mix for the topping was way too much and made the cake almost too soggy around the edges. 3/4c of brown sugar and butter should really be reduced to 1/2c of each. I added spiced rum to mine and soaked the pineapple in rum also. I also added maraschino cherries to the center of each pineapple ring for a little colour :)

I made this last night for the first time for my father-in-law's birthday and it was perfect!!!!!! I made a couple adjustments, for starters I used a bundt cake pan and it made for a beautiful presentation. I doubled the brown sugar and pineapple for the topping and melted the butter first so I could mix in the extra brown sugar and a little vanilla. For the cake batter I added about a cup of pineapple juice to thin it out a bit and it made it very light and moist. This is a new favorite for our family!! I can't wait for an excuse to make it again!!

This recipe was pretty good. The only reason for not giving it the full 4 stars is because the one ingredient which differenciates it from other recipes is the thing which also managed to... well, not exactly ruin it, but it did detract from what it could have been. I was actually looking forward to the unusual addition of the cardamom but we found that its distinct and unique taste did tend to take over the other flavors a little too much. It was a little too jarring. Your mouth is all happy with pineapples, brown sugar, cake.... and then all of sudden, your tastebuds get whacked with "One of these flavors is not like the others!" I used 1.25 tsp and I think if I were to make this again (which I probably will), I will probably use just 1/4 tsp, or more likely none at all. I think the rest of the recipe is very good, and the batter is great. It's also very easy to make; cleaning the pineapple is what took the longest. Using fresh pineapples is key. BTW, we learned that the way you pick them is by plucking the pointy leaves from the top, towards the center of the fruit; they should come out easily if the fruit is ripe. Next time, I will also use more rum at the end; I couldn't even taste it. It's worth trying this recipe with the cardamom the first time you make it, but do note that it is a very strong flavor (my house smelled like it, even though it was double-bagged in Zip-Locs). Overall, a very tasty recipe but for myself, I'd probably give the cardamom a miss next time. Once is enough. One addition which worked great with the other flavors was caramel. I tried it on the leftovers and it was super. That will definitely take cardamom's place on the ingredient list next time!

I just finished baking this cake and its already almost done. Its incredibly moist and flavorful. I have neither a cast iron pan or a cake pan but it baked up fine in my brownie pan. I also replaced the cardamom with nutmeg and was, I think, the happier for it. This is the best pineapple upside down cake I've ever made!

I followed the recipe with the exception of the caradamom (used 1.5 tsp) and I enjoyed the taste but it didn't remind me of my grandma's cake. My husband and nephews absolutely loved it though. I definetly could have used less caradamom.

Instead of the cardamon I used cinnamon and ginger about a teaspoon each. I did not use the liquer. I poured 1/2 the can of juice in a sauce pan with 1/2 C brown sugar, 4 T butter, 1/4 C maple syrup and heated just until simmering about 1 min and poured in bottom of glass baking dish along with pineapple chunks not crushed and rest of juice from the can. The batter was too thick so I then poured from the glass dish some of the juice into the batter until it looked like cake mix. I poured the batter over the pineapple juice mixture and spread evenly. This turned out so good. It tasted just like my Mom use to make. This is a wonderful recipe.

My husband asks for this cake every year on his birthday. We love it. I follow the recipe precisely, using the smaller amount of cardamom. I think the cast-iron skillet is key. I always serve it with fresh whipped cream, sweetened ever so slightly. I can understand that some might not like the cardamom flavor--I think it's something of an acquired taste.

Rating: 3
Wow! I have never made PUDC before, or for that matter, even tasted it, but this was pretty stellar, despite the minor alterations I made. First, I don't own any cast iron- I just don't like it- so I melted the butter and brown sugar in a stainless steel pan, and transferred it to a 9" cake pan. Next time, I might try to keep the pan warm, as the caramel solidified very quickly, though most of it melted nicely while baking. Second, I too used gluten free flour. No problems there. Third, I had no juice, so I pureed the other half of the pineapple, and threw that in, pulp and all. Perfect! I added some lemon and almond extract in addition to the vanilla, and threw some dried cranberries into the batter. Finally, I had no rum, so I used Guaycura Licor de Damiana, but only in the batter, and not on top. It looked so pretty when it came out that I didn't want to add anything. A little of the sugar stuck to the pan, but came loose easily, and still looked pretty when sprinkled on top. Next time-- and there definitely WILL be a next time-- I'd like to add some nuts to the batter. Reducing the cardamom to two and half tsps kept the aroma very exotic, but the flavor was not overpowering. Everybody raved about this cake, and we had a very light dinner in anticipation of dessert, once the aroma overtook my kitchen. I found the cake to be very moist and flavorful. It seems, perfect as it was with all the changes I made as a first timer, like this would be a really hard one to mess up!

This recipe was decent, but I don't know that the effort was worth a repeat performance. The cake didn't hold together very well, the top where the topping soaked in was nice and moist and flavorful, but below that was just a mush of kind of dry flavorless cake. I used my 10" calphalon non-stick frying pan for this and the batter went right to the top of the pan, but didn't bake over. Frustratingly, even with all of that butter oozing around, the pineapple still did not release well at all, only the 1 center pineapple piece stayed in place, the rest stuck to the pan and didn't look very good when I pressed them back into place. I only used 1 tsp of Cardamom as I was making the cake for my father-in- law, who isn't a big spice guy. It was a nice flavor without being distinctively flavored. Followed the rest of the directions to a t, but I wasn't wowed. If I go this direction again I may try the recipe on this site that calls for buttermilk... Good luck!

Pretty easy. I have an infant and was able to make this with baby in my carrier. This was delicious served warm. I agree with many previous posters that 3 tsps of cardamom would be too much. I used about 1/2 teaspoon because I was using seeds straight out of the pod. Didn't have pineapple juice, used apricot mango instead-- don't think it really matters what juice you use. Also didn't have rum so I used an herbal digestif liquer. I didn't pour any over the baked cake, just used a tbsp in the batter. I think more would be too much unless you want a really soused cake.

Rating: 4
This was delicious--definitely one of the best pineapple cakes I have had, and I think the recipe would work with certain other fruit-- pear comes to mind, despite its differences from pineapple. I used a 11 inch Le Creuset black enameled cast iron frying pan, and found that it stuck a little on top. Not sure if that was inevitable or just bad luck, and the cake was probably a little thinner than it would have been otherwise. I baked for 40 minutes to compensate. I also used orange juice instead of pineapple juice since I didn't have the latter. I did use 2 Tsp cardamom, and thought it was perfect-- seemed relatively subtle but gave the cake some fragrance that worked well with the fruit and the brown sugar.

I loved this-perfect for Easter. I did use a little more cardamom than called for and didnt find it cloying at all. I did bake it just a tad too long so was a tiny bit dry, will bake less time next go around.

My mom made pineapple upside down cake quite often when I was growing up, so this was certainly comfort food for me. I bought a 10-inch skillet specifically for this recipe and it was worth it because I'll make this again and again. My store didn't have pineapple juice, so I pureed the leftover half pineapple in a food processor and forced the pulp through a sieve--got plenty of juice to use in the cake. The cake was slightly crumbly, but delicious with the cardamom. Cardamom is certainly the prevailing flavor in the cake, very exotic and goes well with the fruit. Awesome recipe.

Rating: 4
I had never made pineapple upside down cake before, and it was a complete success. I only used half the cardamom called for (because of recommendations and because I ran out), and I used grapefruit juice in place of the pineapple juice because all I had was half a grapefruit sitting around. It was delicious! Even those among my guests who were dubious about the whole pineapple upside down cake concept took seconds. The cake itself was particularly delicious. Make this cake. Seriously. You won't regret it.

Rating: 4
If I could give this 5 forks, I would. My hubby just got seconds (well, I guess seconds & thirds would be more descriptive), and can't stop praising it. A couple of caveats: I reduced the butter/sugar of the topping to 1/2 stick butter and 1/2 cup sugar. And since we're both a little wheat adverse, I used spelt flour - and it's still an absolutely terrific recipe. As hubby said, "this is the best pineapple upside-down cake I've ever had - not too sweet, not too heavy, not too anything". 'nuff said.

I have made this cake 3 times and I continue to receive compliments. I use a can of pineapple rings, which I find much easier, not only for consistent ring-size but my grocery store is dicey with produce. Just cut the rings in half in the can and they make the most beautiful pattern on the bottom that people seem to think took forever. Do NOT add the rum at the end unless you just really love rum. Honestly, the rum in the batter gave it just enough flavor without being overpowering.

I made this cake this past weekend for my hubby. It looked beautiful and tasted amazing. The bad thing was that I made it in a springform pan and it leaked in my oven.

I made a simplified version of this cake and it was still really good. Dad and niece are picky eaters, so I left out cardamom and rum altogether. For the topping I used canned pineapple and rather than browning in a skillet as suggested, I simply buttered the bottom of baking dish, lined with pineapple, and dotted with brown sugar before adding batter. It was delicious and easy.

I made this recipe twice. The first time it came out great. I used pineapple puree instead of juice, and it was a fairly dry pineapple. It was good but missing that pineapple tang I think of with this cake. The second time, not QUITE as great. I used pineapple juice as called for, and added about 1 Tbsp. of pineapple juice to the brown sugar/butter mixture, and the pineapple itself was much juicier. I got that pineapple flavor I was looking for, but there was just too much liquid here this time, the pineapple slices disappeared into the cake, and the cake almost fell apart. Of course it still tasted delicious but not as pretty as the first time around. So, friends, follow the recipe exactly! It's a good cake, as long as you do that.

This cake rose up to the edge of the 10" Lodge cast iron pan. Be sure to use a larger or deeper pan if not using a cast iron skillet. Refridgerated well and was good the next day too. Be sure to line the pan completely with fruit, it helps keep the cake together by preventing it from absorbing too much liquid during the baking process.

The topping is a little on the greasy side but recipes for the cast iron skillet usually are - released beautifully. Adjust butter in topping to your taste & type of pan accordingly. Can make the topping as for a Flan to cut the grease even more. The batter makes a classic european spice cake (e.g. Apple spice teacakes) & is supposed to have a soft crumb & will not hold chunks of fruit together like a dense carrot cake. So fruit has to be sliced thin and layered on the pan. This cake will also fall apart if too much rum or syrup is drizzled on top. A very nice teacake & when made in a cast iron skillet, has crunchy edges.

Luscious Christmas cake! Still savoring it -- needed to get away from the table so thought I would review it. I substituted Cherry Liqueur for the rum, and added 2 extra tabs of butter to the batter - richer - and used Vietnamese Cinnamon in place of cardomom . For the topping, I used a full stick of butter and a cup of brown sugar - which gave more sauce on top. It was wonderful!

This recipe reminds me of the cake at Roy's restaurant; which, in my opinion, is the best there is. Yes, 3 tbs cardamom is way too much -- especially if you grind it yourself (like I do). I use green cardamom but you can try black or white if you prefer. I never have rum on hand so I use raspberry or orange liquor. This recipe gets my highest rating of 4 forks.

I received a fruit basket with a nice fresh pineapple in it so I made this cake yesterday with a couple of minor modifications. No cast iron skillet, so I put the butter-brown sugar mixture in a 9-inch square baking pan - all my round pans are springform and I wanted to avoid the leakage others (either here or as posted under other PUDC recipes) have experienced. Ground cardamom fresh from pods in mortar and pestle, about 1 1/2 teaspoons. The subtle hint of spice was just right. I used buttermilk instead of pineapple juice and added a little extra rum to the batter to thin it out a bit. The cake came out delicious; somewhat dense and didn't rise much (possibly from the buttermilk). I would add a litle soda if using buttermilk in the future (it's called for in the fresh PUDC recipe elsewhere on this site). A very homey yummy cake; certainly worth making!

I used two small cake tins with thickly sliced pineapples - ring in the center and quartered slices around it - I juiced the leftover pineapple including the core, used less than 1 tsp of cardamom seeds and 1/4 c. less sugar in the batter. Next time I will also use less sugar in the topping and even less cardamom ground from seed. However, my boyfriend thought it was the best thing I've ever made and he doesn't have a sweet tooth and I'm not too bad cook but, not much of a baker.

I will never make PUDC with anything but fresh pineapple from now on. This recipe was wonderful! I halved the amt of cardamom called for, since I used freshly ground pods and the balance was perfect. I also made this cake in a 12 inch skillet, which I think was the right size for the amount of butter and sugar called for in the topping. Also, don't be afraid to cut the pineapple rounds nice and thick - you'll be glad you did when you turn out the cake!

I'm not a wimpy eater, but I kept trying to ignore the cardamom flavor. Even after adding only 1 tsp, I was still wishing I had used cinnamon instead. Came out great in a greased springform pan. Will definitely make again, but no cardamom!

Made this cake for my own birthday. I cut the cardamom down to 1.5 teaspoons and was halfway hoping it would be too exotic for the rest of the family. I was wrong! It was wonderful!

Delicious! Though I cut the cardemom to 1.5 teaspoons, and it was a fine flavor. Not sure i wanted an overwhelming Indian Tea flavor.

I have made this cake a number of times now, and I am always amazed each time at how delicious it is! I follow the directions to a tee using 2 tsp. cardamom (grinding it fresh from pods makes it so much better)and would not think of substituting another spice in its place. I think it makes the cake!

I just made this recipe with a few adjustments. Instead of cardomom, I used 1/2 cup shredded coconut and added sour cherries in between the pineapple pieces on top. I also baked it in a springform pan with buttered sides to prevent sticking. It worked really well and the pan came away without any problems. I served it with coconut whipped cream and it was a massive hit.

We made this cake in a 10x3" round professional cake pan to allow plenty of room on the sides to rise, and lined the bottom with parchment, spraying the paper and pan sides with non-stick baking spray. Since it was a larger pan, we increased the brown sugar mixture by one-half, which was perfect if you like a goo-ier tooped cake. We also used just 2 tsp of cardomom (ground from seeds) and it was unusual and perfectly spiced. We used fresh pineapple rings (made sure my husband dried them three times!) and added maraschino cherries to the middle of the rings and gaps. It turned out onto a platter perfectly when done and was so lovely, we e-mailed a picture to our parents right away. Was a big hit at our Easter dinner... next time will try it warm with vanilla ice cream - yum.

Very yummy cake. I doubled the recipe with no problems. Had to substitute cardamom with allspice and nutmeg. Fresh pineapple is definitely the way to go, but I live in Hawaii where they are plentiful year round.

This cake is excellent. Reason for 3 forks is that I halved sugar and butter in topping and halved sugar in dough. Sugar amount in recipe is way too much for our taste. Also used 1tsp cardamom and removed cake from oven after 40 min. Otherwise followed recipe. Moist, delicious and a keeper.

Unbelievable recipe! I love PUSD cake; this is by far my all time favorite. The cardamom complimented the fresh pineapple exquisitely and made the recipe. Please try the recipe just as is... even if you typically are spice-shy.

This was great! I'd never made PUDC except with canned pineapple and a cake mix and I never will again! I used 3t cardamon because I'm typically one to add more spices, not less, and it was perfect! Cake was moist and stayed that way and the topping was terrific. DH preferred the leftovers cold. Very good, I'll definitely make it again!

Needed an old-fashioned comfort dessert for our Sunday Dinner club and this fit the bill. Used a little less cardamom but kept true to the recipe otherwise and it was delicious. Serve with a cold sip of Moscato d'Asti and you are in business!

This was great, although I left out the cardamon and substituted cinnamon. Mine ended up a little dry and I took it out at 35 minutes, maybe my oven was a little hot. I also used a calphalon non stick skillet instead of cast iron.

I had forgotten how good pineapple upside down cake is. I did not add the cardamom though. Without it the wonderful flavors of butter, pineapple, caramel and rum are allowed to take center stage. The cake crumb was dense to hold up to the topping and soak up the juices but remains very tender. I did not have pineapple juice on hand so I used orange juice and that worked out great as well. I have to remember to make this more often!

I used fresh pineapple, no cardamon, no rum on top, and it was still delicious. I would add in the recipe description that you need to lightly grease the cast iron skillet with vegetable oil or butter. Terrific!

Great- used 2 teaspoons of cardamon. I also used spiced rum instead of plain dark rum. Also used pineapple/orange juice by a lucky accident. Served at a party, and at least three people said it was the best they had ever had. So definitely give it a try.

Love this recipe. I use canned pineapple and maraschino cherries and reserve the liquid for the 1/2 c. pinepple juice part of the recipe. 2 tsp. cardamom works well, but those who do not like cardamom should not add it. I up the cardamom taste by using it in my whipped cream topping.

Really delicious. Used only 1 teaspoon cardamom, which was plenty. My pineapple juice was very sweet, so added about a tablespoon of lime juice. Used a heavy 9-inch cake pan instead of the 10-inch cast-iron skillet-, and cake fit fine, didn't overflow. Possibly the best pineapple upside down cake I've ever had.

I rated this recipe with 4 forks because even after burning the topping it still tasted wonderful. I can just imagine how it will taste without the burned topping. I did not use cardamon since I did not have this spice handy but next time, I will be sure to include it. The cake itself was pretty moist and tasty. Definitely a keeper.

This cake is spectacular. Made it for a friend's Bday last year. She asked for it again this!. 2 tsp Cardamom seems perfect. Not for the faint of taste. ;) Enough said... go make this cake!

This is a fabulous cake. I omitted the cardamon and added vanilla extract. I thought the topping that is prepared in the pan (butter and brown sugar) made the cake too sweet; I would reduce the amount of topping next time. I did not have a cast iron pan, instead I used a skillet to start the dessert and a ceramic dish to bake the cake in. The result was a moist cake with a rich and crusty topping...a definite hit!

Rating: 4
I loved this cake! I made it in a Pampered Chef bunt cake stone instead of a skillet and added 1/2 cup of shaved almonds to the mixture. With rum & fresh pinapple (and the absence of marashino cherries!), it's a far cry from the usual upside down cake. A bonus, the house smells AMAZING while it's baking!

This cake came out looking beautifully! But the Cardamom took over the flavor of the sweet pineapple. I substitued the pineapple juice for 1/4 cup pineapple juice, 1/4 cup lemon and orange juice. Overall I thought the recipie called for too much sugar so the tart lemon juice and less sugar ( 1/4cup less overall) helped. But the Cardamom really ruined the pineapple flavor for me. I used 2 teaspons of Cardamom. I would recommend ommiting the cardamom all together or just use a pinch.

Very good!! I added some chopped pecans and shredded coconut to the pineapple topping. I like cardamom in baked cakes and pastries, but I thought 3 tsp. a bit much so I added half the amount.

too much liquid in topping. cake turned to mush when put on platter. tasted very good, but presentation and texture certainly were lacking.. i used fresh pineapple and butter/b sugar per recipe. didn't add the sprinklings of rum, as additional liquid was clearly not needed. perhaps my pineapple was exceptionally juicy. will try again with a bit less of everything in topping. used 3/4 tsp cinnamon instead of cardamom, and thought it was a nice subtle touch.

This cake is easy and fun to make, and it's delicious. I'm not a lover of cardamom, so I only used one teaspoon(which was fine). I've made this cake four times and I always need more pineapple than the recipe calls for. Well worth the effort.

This was an excellent cake - very moist and delicious. I used only 2tsp. cardamom as 3tsp. seems to be too much and it turned out wonderfully. Take care not to beat the mixture too much or it will be tough. I made it with good quality canned pineapple and it turned out just fine, however I imagine if I had used fresh it would have been that much better. My guests all asked for the recipe. Nice served with vanilla bean ice cream.

I substituted 3/4 tablespoon of ground cinnamon for the cardamom, and the batter tasted good--not too spicy. Using fresh pineapple made the top of the cake look picture perfect.

THE BEST EVER! This is the best cake I have ever made -and I have made a lot of cakes!! Even better than some chocolate cakes (gasp!). I also used only 2 tsp cardamon and it really made the cake.

I came out beautifully from the skillet and was SIMPLE to make.

This won rave reviews from all of us on Father's Day. I used a large can of pineapple rings(20 halved pieces)and sprinkled chopped pecans over the pineapple before topping with the batter. It came out of the skillet with ease. This is my husband's favorite cake and this recipe will always be the one I make. It tastes delicious and so beautiful I think it could win a ribbon at the state fair! Also, I used 2 tsp. of the cardamon and it was just perfect.

I'm not a cardamon lover and nearly replaced it with cinnamon and ginger, but at the last minute, I decided to make a recipe as directed for a change. It was absolutely delicious! The amount of cardamon (2 tsp) gave it a very fresh taste and was a perfect complement for the pineapple and rum. I'd give this 3.5 forks.

This was terrific. I used canned pineapple and I put a maraschino cherry in the middle of each pineapple slice, a little bit of tradition. But I used the 3 tsp. cardmom which makes the cake, in my opinion. Otherwise, I followed ingedients and quantities to the letter. Also, the cake was as light as a feather, it quivered slightly as the pices were taken out, and was very moist. I think any cake that was tough and dry was probably overbeaten, I mixed mine just until the ingredients were absorbed. The rum was the finishing coup de grace. Just a great recipe.

This is a very good recipe; moist and flavorful. No beaten egg whites, as some recipes reccomend, but I like the resulting denseness. The second time I made this, I took a leaf from Cook's Illustrated's book: I used four tblsp butter and a cup of brown sugar to make the topping, and then cooked these together for four minutes to achieve a more caramelized consistency -- I liked the results very much -- a bit tarte-tatin-ish. Lacking a skillet, I did the cake in two stages and it came out beautifully. Also, in a pinch used canned pineapple which was, if less elegant, still very tasty.

This cake is by far the best pineapple upside-down cake either my husband or I has ever tasted. We used a delicious rum, Planters Gold (I know, rum is not usually described as delicious but trust me on this... this stuff is nectar) and the cake was so good. I didn't have any cardamom so I left it out and the result was still superb. When we finished the last bite, my husband asked when I would make another one. I don't have a cast iron skillet so I caramelized the sugar in my Calphalon, then poured it into a European style cake pan that I'd sprayed with non-stick. No problems turning it out and it looked beautiful. Try this cake!

I thought this cake was fantastic! It went untouched on my buffet table, because I had so many desserts, and I think when people think of pineapple upside-down cake, they think of the bland types with canned pineapple. This cake was moist and delicious on the inside with a chewier texture on the outside from the cast-iron skillet. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and I nearly ate the whole thing myself.

I loved this recipe. It can be made much simpler than recipe lets on. I didn't bother with the sifting and the slow additions. I just whipped all the cake ingredients in order and made the cake in a non-stick cake pan. The brown sugar topping requires a lot more brown sugar to butter. Also, if you put the pineapple slices at a 45 deg angle to bottom of pan you really overlap them and the finished cake has a zig-zag crown-like trim at the top. Laying the pinapple flat doesn't fit enough pineapple in and then the cake is too dry. Put some foil under the cake pans because the brown sugar bottom tends to boil over the edges of the cake pan during baking. Loved it!

Great cake. I sauted the pineapple cut into chunks in the brown sugar/butter until it begins to caramelize. Also, add freshly ground nutmeg to the topping and the cake and omit the rum. A real crowd pleaser!

I tried this recipe while visiting relatives in the Netherlands. Using a Calphalon non-stick pan (the Dutch equivalent from Vroom & Dreesmann)really made removing the cake effortless. I added coconut flakes and 1/8 cup coconut milk to make the cake turn out more like a pina colada; Yum!

Of the upside down cakes I have made, this one is by far the best. I like to chop the pineapple so, when eating the cake, it is easier to take bite-size portions. If larger pineapple sections are used, I find it more difficult to cut the cake without making a mess. Chopping the pineapple makes a better presention on the plate. The cardamom flavor is quite interesting, two tsp. is the correct amount.
