Made the dressing beforehand to try it out as I'm serving this to guests tomorrow, and it was a total let down. WAY TOO MUCH OIL. I definitely should have listened to the other reviews!!! Just threw it out completely, such a waste, and started over. This time using just over 1/2 cp of lime juice, but then 2 TBS oil and 4 tsp rice wine vinegar, with an extra dash of vinegar and an extra dash of chili powder. WHAT a difference oh my goodness. So glad I redid it, it actually tastes good now and is worth eating! Cant wait to see how it tastes over the slaw (which didnt seem to get bad reviews, which mostly were abt the boring dressing). Plan to serve with Barefoot Contessa's confetti corn and shrip quesadillas with a fun fruit salsa. should be a colorful meal!

I made this for a dinner party and it was an instant hit! I added some chopped scallions and substituted a bag of broccoli slaw for the jicama (couldn't find any in Maine) and also squeezed a half of an orange into the dressing and it turned out fantastic. The leftovers were even better the next day. I will definitely make it again.

I ran across this recipe a few months back and made it into a 4- Star southwestern side with one simple modification. JUST OMIT THE OIL and you have a fabulous bright slaw. THe reason this recipe has such low ratings is that the oil would diminish all those bright wonderful flavors. I am not a low- fat zealot; I use olive and canola oils in 99% of the salads I made--it simply isn't needed here. Lose the oil and you have a keeper you will keep coming back to.

I agree with "daiken." This is a very flavorful health-conscious recipe. Lacking ancho chile powder or any dried anchos, I used a smoky guatemalen chile powder the first time, which gave the slaw a little more fire than I might have preferred (even though I used less than the specified amount--so I topped it with bite-sized pieces of goat cheese to cool things down. The combination was superb. --I have already made it again--and this time a few of someone else's toasted pine nuts got mixed in, to excellent effect. I will definitely make it again.

The people who find this recipe to be lacking in taste must have burned off their taste buds with too many hot peppers. It is delicious. I grind my own ancho powder and two tablespoons gives the dressing just the right kick. My family loves it and guests are very complimentary. I wonder if those who add sugar overlooked the honey in the recipe. I tried a good olive oil the first time I made it but I found the oil taste a little strong. I much prefer the taste with canola oil (as per the recipe). Try scooping this slaw with tortilla chips.

I made the dressing only and it was horrible. No taste and very watery. I was looking for a thicker ancho chili salad dresing and this was certainly not it.

I have made this recipe repeatedly to rave reviews. I cut the oil which kicks up the flavor. I also make the dressing and then prepare the amount of vegetables needed for my meal plan and use only the amount of dressing needed. The rest of the dressing stores in the fridge nicely for next time. I never use Napa cabbage, just purple or green. This went great with a Mexican inspired theme dinner recently.

YUM YUM! Everytime I make this slaw I am asked for the recipe. I tweak it slightly by making the following changes; increase both the rice vinegar & chili powder. I also substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil. Be generous with the cilantro. Well worth all the chopping!

Agree with the people who said too much work for too little flavor. We increased the lime juice the second day (the recipe makes a TON of salad) which gave the salad some additional flavor, and we may also try the rice vinegar suggestion with a little sugar.

I should have incorporated some of the comments suggested when I made it. The recipe was lacking something that none of us could identify... mostly lacking zing. I am surprised it was a Bobby Flay recipe - expected more...

I LOVE Jicama, so it's a no brainer for me. I also cut down the oil (for health reasons). It's fresh tasting and very crunchy. I'd recommend it.

I was concerned about this recipe because of the comments by some of the cooks. I partially agree with them. The recipe is slightly off - So, I cut the oil in half, increased the chili powder and rice vinegar (by about 1 TBL each), and added one TBL of sugar. The taste was amazing. I'd definately make it again.

My husband gave this one fork; I gave it three, and we decided to split the difference. A fairly uninspired recipe, particularly if you skimp on or eliminate the jicama. There are better slaw recipes out there.

Great texture. Any crunchy veggies are a great addition. Light slaw a nice change from heavy mayo based versions.

I was looking for something different for our Father's Day bbq. I love jicama, and enjoyed the spicy peanut sauce recipe I found on epicurious, so I thought I'd give this a try. As one other reviewer noted (who I should have listened to), this recipe had very little flavor and was a whole lot of work.

I forgot to mention that I always use extra virgin olive oil.

We really liked the flavors in this dish. I added some scallions but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Goes great with baked beans and hamburgers.

This salad was wonderful. I served it for an "elegant" lunch with grilled quail. As suggested I made the dressing a day ahead and then cut the jicama and shredded the cabbage (napa wasn't available so I used savoy) and carrot in the Cuisinart. Next day the leftovers were still crunchy.

Delicious with Bobby's glazed porkloin recipe . . . perfect combination of flavors.

This recipe is too much work for too little flavor. I was very disappointed in the outcome...I expect much more from a Bobby Flay recipe!!
