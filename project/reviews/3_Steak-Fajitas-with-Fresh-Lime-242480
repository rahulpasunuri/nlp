Excellent! Made with chicken and used 1/4 or less of sriracha because my husband is sensitive to spicy hot food.

This was a good marinade for fajitas. I modified a little by adding some fresh cilantro and then grilling the steak. It had a good lime flavor, and wasn't overly spicy. We will use this one again, and next time offer to the kids as well.

We really liked this. First, I used flank steak from the local butcher, which really made a difference in the taste I think. It did take much longer to cook to get it to medium but maybe I didn't have the pan hot enough. I added red pepper, thinly sliced to the onion marinade and used chili garlic sauce instead of Rooster Sauce. We didn't have it with guacamole but it would go really well with the flavors, and help soften the kick of the chili. However, instead of store bought guacamole just get an avocado and mash it up with some salsa. It tastes better and it's better for you.

I don't know where to start.. browning has to do with the temp of the grill nothing else.. get the fire Hotter.. Much Hotter.. these marinades, as research and science have shown us, Do not soften meat. Skirt steak is lean and tough. so medium rare is what to shoot for.. I cook quickly and tu;rn turn turn.. also when nearly done, wrap in foil and let sit for ten minutes. Cut Against the Grain.. thin. thin thin.. if you want softer meat, ny strip..will do the job.. I am not sure what some folks are thinking .. Thank you..

This was really delicious! I used salmon instead of steak, no fajitas, just laid salmon over carmelized onion mixture. Used cilantro instead of basil. Yum! Will definitely make again!

recipe was good and easy to make. I thought the spices worked nicely together. I let the steak soak in the mixture for about 2 hrs, added yellow and green peppers to the onion mixture and grilled the steak separately, and it was delicious. If folks don't like skirt steak, buy a better steak. you'll like the result better I bet.

I also do not understand those who do not like this recipe. For me, the meat wasn't tough although I did slice it up into very small pieces. Now when I make it I use chicken instead though. It's a little lighter that way I think. Also, I put in a lot more lime juice than the recipe calls for and tad less of the srriracha. Otherwise, this recipe is super easy, quick, and delicious.

I am not a big red meat eater so I substituted chicken breast and it was yummy. The tomatoes and basil give it a wonderful taste and the lime juice adds a little extra kick, it would even be good over pasta.

I really wanted to like this recipe as well. I anticipated a flavor packed fajita from the ingredients and was disappointed. In the end, the only taste that came through was the heat from the chili sauce. I used skirt steak and it was really tough. Overall, it was a huge disappointment.

I really wanted to like this recipe. My family is always happy when we have fajitas. However, my twelve year old son nearly choked, my 16 year old with braces nearly lost a bracket because the meat was so tough! We ended up eating pasta and I threw the skirt steak into the slow cooker the next evening and shredded it and proceeded as the recipe directed. It was ok, just not what I had anticipated. Next time, I would use a different cut of meat.

I have to give an addendum to my original review. I made this recipe again with flank steak (last time I used strip steak) and I now agree with other reviewers that the meat did not get tender and was chewy. I still like the marinade flavor but would use other cuts of meat next time

Ugh! Terrible recipe. Slice the steak first, then marinade in lime, oil, chili powder and garlic. Cook in a cast iron skillet on high heat. Use same skillet to cook sliced bell pepper and onion and serve with homemade guacamole. If tomatoes are used, they should be quickly seared separately and tossed quickly with the rest of the ingredients, but for best results, omit cooked tomatoes. Instead, add diced tomatoes to the guacamole with lots of minced onion, garlic and cilantro. Yum! I'm always skeptical of any recipe that has you use store bought sauces. What's the point?

Just Ok Needs work.

Good advice on how to cook and cut skirt steak, Cook from NY. And, yes, freaksho, scoring skirt steak before marinating and giving the marinade time to penetrate are essential for building flavor. But even if you follow these methods, the recipe is quite lame and undeserving of the name "fajitas."

Rating: 0
Most skirt steak recipes I've seen recommend scoring or making small cuts in the steak to promote penetration of the marinade. I'm also surprised that it only called for 10 minutes of marinading. That seems short for chicken, let alone a piece of beef that needs some help getting tenderized.

I can't understand the people who don't like this recipe--the flavors are fabulous. You just need to remember to sear the meat at very high temperature, not cook it too long and cut on the diagonal. I've made this twice and love it.

this recipe should be called suckjitas. Please- you can do much better than this!

Not very good, and certainly shouldn't be called "fajitas." If you use store bought guacamole, you're crazy, since not only will it be full of toxic chemicals and preservatives, but it will taste lousy as well. If you're too lazy to make your own, then get some fresh- made from your favorite local taqueria.

I was lukewarm on this recipe. I used skirt steak and was careful not to overcook it. It turned out tender enough. However, as another reviewer mentioned, mine didn't brown well either. And I didn't like the whole cherry tomatoes in there. Too much of a mouth-full. I'd cut them in half next time. Lastly, I'm surprised no one had a problem with the Sriracha. I cut it back and still thought the dish was a bit hotter than I'd like. I would make again for a quick weeknight meal.

I loved this recipe. Traditional fajitas usually are too heavy for me. Other reviews complain about the skirt steak being tough, but that's not a fault of the recipe, it's the cut of meat. Anyway, everyone raved about it when I made it, and will definitely make it again!

This is not the best fajita recipe out there. I did use skirt steak and marinated it all day. It wasn't very tender and the flavors weren't stellar.

I thought the dish was delicious, the steak was very tender and tasty. Did not use skirt steak however. Had a wonderful authentic flavor. I served it with sour cream in addition to homemade guacamole.

I bought flank steak, marinated it for the recommended time. The flavors were wonderful, and the meat was remarkably tender after such a short marination time. I forgot the guac and wished I had had some. I liked the dish.

I used skirt steak but marinated it for much longer than instructed--perhaps a few hours. Other changes: strips of poblano pepper instead of tomatoes, no basil, grill pan rather than a skillet. The marinade is delicious and definitely a keeper.

I used skirt steak and marinated for about 20 minutes, but the steak was still tough. Not the best fajitas recipe.

I used flap steak, as skirt steaks were not available. Perhaps there was too much liquid, but the beef did not brown well, the mixture was was rather soupy, and the meat was chewy. I would probably not use the flap meat again, but might try with flank steak or sirloin, marinated longer for some flavor.

As promised, this was an easy and quick recipe - and most importantly very tasty! I accidentally bought strip steak instead of skirt steak, but I'm curious if those who got skirt steak thought 10 minutes was enough marinade time to get the meat tender.
