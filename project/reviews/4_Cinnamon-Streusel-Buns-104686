Overall a great recipe. I was worried the dough was too sticky but it was easy to roll out with ample flour dusting and an overnight rest in the refrigerator.I would, however try to melt the sugar in the butter and sprinkle the pecans as both of these made the streusel hard to spread, and the sugar came out more crunchy than chewy. I also added a few tbsp of maple syrup to the brown sugar butter mixture to make it a little more wet. It made a large casserole and a half, more than it says, at least mine did.

I've made many recipes for cinnamon buns over the years, and this is one of the best. The dough is very tender and not too sweet. It doesn't give a lot of caramel on the bottom, but doesn't need it. This is the recipe that my family enjoys most. I make the dough in the bread machine and it couldn't be easier.

What a treat! Not hard to make at all. Messy but not difficult. We got 3 pans (one glass pie dish and 2 8x8 pyrex) of 8 rolls each out of this one ball of dough. I added a few Tbl real maple syrup to the streusel mix and it was gooey and delicious. Also made a glaze of powdered sugar and maple syrup to drizzle over the top. (probably 1 cup pwdr sugar and 1/3 cup maple syrup?? thinned with 2 tsp milk until the consistency was right) Also added a tsp cinnamon to the dough as previous reviewer suggested. Can't wait for another reason to make these!

Every bit worth the effort and the firefighters I made them for loved them too. I will be making them again for Christmas morning......

Absolutely my favourite indulgent sweet recipe. I top them with LEMON CREAM CHEESE ICING and they are the best we have ever eaten. They have become a family tradition for Easter breakfast after 40 days of lent and treat fasting!

LOVED THIS RECIPE. It was simple and yummy. I have made this 3 times now in one week and they have all been conusumed all 3 times. I really like the simplicity of the dough and how you just mix and stick in the fridge. I would make a bit more steuusel though as i didn't think there was enough for the laying on the bottom of the pan as then you get the gooey part. I do wonder if i can freeze the dough for later use? Its easy and you will get great reviews!!

I loved these, hence the 4 forks, which I rarely give. If you are a fan of the chain Cinnabon, these will be a real treat. I made one small alteration to the recipe, and that was to substitute 1/2 a cup of wheat flour. I also left the dough in the fridge for 2 days before I got around to making the rolls. These are really, really good!

whoa! these are totally over the top. followed the recipe exactly--maybe a first ;)--and they turned out perfectly. very very rich, and somewhat time consuming, but wonderful results!

This recipe was okay. The dough turned out tender and light, but I am not fond of the topping. It was dry. Although I never expect completed recipes to look like the picture provided, I don't expect them to be so far away from my own experience. There was no lovely, sticky, caramelized topping. Mine turned out dry and made the entire recipe less than I had expected. Maybe an icing would have helped if it weren't for the fact that the recipe was already too sweet.

I halved the recipe and had to add more flour to the dough because it was more like batter than dough but still they were delicious. and yes, over night refridgeration is very important. will definitely make again.

These cinnamon buns were amazing! It was my first attempt ever to make cinnamon buns and they worked out, so it's not too complicated. I didn't have any milk, so I just added a little extra water. I was worried this might make them weird, but they were still delicious. Thanks!

These were fantastic and easy to make! They were devoured in a matter of minutes.

Followed recipe exact and had no problems with the dough being sticky. I ended up with 9 rolls (very generous in size) and they fit perfectly in the pan. I do agree with the other reviewers and will cut back by a 1/2 cup or so on the brown sugar. Other than that OUT OF THIS WORLD!

Excellent, and easy! I halved the recipe and put it in an 8 X 8 pan. I love not having to actually knead the dough, and leaving it in the fridge overnight is key. Even the next day, heated up in the microwave, they were still delicious.

All I can say is HEAVENLY! I made these for a playgroup at my house and loved the fact I could prepare it ahead of time. I started two days before I needed them and it worked out perfectly. Unlike the directions, I used my food processor to prepare the dough it it worked great. The dough is VERY, VERY sticky but refridgerating overnight makes rolling out a breeze. I also cut down the number of rolls to 12 and put them in a 13x9 glass pan. I then refrigerated the rolls overnight again and then baked them the next day when I needed them. They were fabulous!I did not find the brown sugar to be too much, either did my guests. In fact, to make them even more decadent, I made a cream cheese icing (see Maple-Cream Cheese Icing Recipe and omitted the maple syrup) which I piped on top when they came out of the oven. This are so good you'll be making them often. These would be great for a brunch or a holiday breakfast fare since all the prep work can be done ahead.Bon Appetit!

Absolutely wonderful. My son made them and sold them at a yard sale with hot coffee. He made more money on buns than we did on our stuff!

A very good foundation for a cinnamon bun. I used Canadian Maple syrup and white sugar in lieu of the brown sugar, and a cranberry granola mix with almonds for the pecans. Very easy, and almost foolproof. I have a catering company, and these buns were a success!

These are good, but the streusel is way too sweet. I will use about 1 1/2 cups brown sugar next time.

Have made this recipe twice. It's definitely easier to work with the dough after refrigerating overnight, if you have the patience to wait. Second time I cut into 12 portions which fits the pan much better. Only complaint is that I expected the brown sugar to carmelize somewhat - as it is, the topping is a little too sugary.

These are incredible -- relatively easy and very delicious.

these were great, but the second time i added cinnamon to the dough mixture itself. it made for a more flavorful bun. without the cinnamon in the dough, it was a little too sweet and not cinnamon-y enough.

These are delicious! My husband says they are "perfection"! I cut the salt down to 1 tsp. and the brown sugar down to 2 Cups. I also have had problems with pan size/undercooked centers. When I make them again I will use 2 pans. I also make them with 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white flour. Gives them more interest and texture.

I had some troubles with this recipe. It was very easy until I got to the pan size. There were a total of 16 buns and they were a very tight squeeze in one pan. I also refrigerated the buns overnight before baking them. Maybe that was the problem. The outer buns were very good, but the buns in the center of the baking dish were undercooked and gooey. I'll try making these again, but next time maybe divide them into two seperate pans.

I made these the night before and they were very well-received by my coworkers. The only problem I had related to the pan size, which was a little odd. Make sure the pan you invert the rolls into is a little bigger than the baking pan, or you'll have a mess.

VERY easy to make. Usually yeast type recipes scare me off but I've made this twice with the greatest of ease. I found that there was sufficient dough to make two extra buns - nobody shedding any tears over that here! Very tasty but I think I prefer a more syrupy, sticky, gooey, ooey type of filling. The filling was delicious inside the bun however I feel it was too sugar-crunchy on the top when too much accumulated. I guess that could be considered a good thing.

Very delicious and exactly what I expected. However, I doubled the topping and it was too much (sugar city). I would add perhaps a topping and a half and it would be perfect.

I made these over the weekend, and boy, is this one a keeper!! To date, my go-to recipe had been Cinnamon Rolls with Pecans (Bon Appetit 10/99), but I think these may have unseated the champion! While I still think the 10/99 recipe may be just a TINY bit better in terms of presentation and texture, this recipe was absolutely delicious and it's INFINITELY easier and less time consuming. Allowing the dough to rise overnight in the fridge really cuts out a lot of the time and labor associated with many other versions, and although I was skeptical about it, the rolls turned out wonderfully - large and dense, but very tender. As a result of the comment from one of the earlier reviewers, I made 50% more filling, but it was just entirely too much. Next time, I'll follow the recipe exactly. Perfect as is!

The recipe was easy for a non-baker like me. I ended up with two pans of buns and not enough streusel. They were a big hit at my daughter's sleepover

I am not a really good baker when it comes to yeast, but these buns were incredibly easy to make - my family didn't believe I actually baked them!
