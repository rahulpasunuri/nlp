Made it exactly as written. Well, I might have thrown in an extra clove of garlic for good measure. ;-) It was great. Served with rice. Will make it again.

Wonderful! - I used thighs instead of breasts. It came out super moist. And we're planning to use the herb butter on pork chops next.

oregano really overpowered the pepper flakes and garlic, it had an odd taste to it, my husband did not care for it - so next time no oregano

Lets just say chef Ramsey wouldn't have let me put this out on the floor. lol Next time I will use thinner chicken breast. So unfortunately I wasn't abe to enjoy it like I know I could have. Will definitly try again.

Started with good chicken, added butter and fresh herbs - the results had to be good, right? I was a bit disappointed. I expected more from this dish. Just OK. No synergy to the ingredients/methods to raise this to a more delicious meal.

I'll definitely make this again. I was looking for something quick to make with what I had on hand. I subsituted with about 1/2 tblsp of dried oregano and it was still really tasty. Check out the similar recipe from Gourmet Jul '05, "Pan Seared Chicken with Tarragon Butter Sauce."

A pretty easy, pretty tasty dish that I'd definitely make again. Nothing incredible, just a good, solid chicken dish.

Used less butter. Has a good taste. Cooked mushrooms in the butter mixture with the chicken and they were amazing!

The oregano sets the stage as the aroma fills the air during preparation! The chicken breasts look fabulous with their crisp, brown appearance. The flavor is simple and full of impact.

Great way to prepare chicken! I've served it several times to guests, and it's always a hit, even the time when I added WAY too much salt by mistake...:) I've used boneless/skinless and bone-in/skin-on breasts and even thighs in a pinch - it's always delicious. Be warned - the aroma may draw in strangers off the street.

Tasty but nothing special. We'll probably have it again as the husband said "save that recipe".

I was a bit hesitant to make this due to some of the reviews that said this dish was bland. This dish is FANTASTIC. I DID make a few adjustmants to the recipe though. Here they are: I used 4 large garlic cloves rather than just 1. I also added about 2 teaspoons of capers to the garlic butter. I pan fried some sliced mushrooms in butter and spread the mushrooms on top of the chicken after I had spread the oregeno butter on the skin of the chicken (on a plate and not in the pan). The result was a very gourmet dish that my wife loved with little effort. Again, HIGHLY RECOMMEND with these adjustments. Served with rice and steamed spinach. Yum.

NOthing spectacular. Did not meet my expectations -- this turned out to be basic chicken and bland.

Okay, but don't like it well enough to make again. My husband liked it with a side of spaghetti with marina sauce.

The dish was pretty good - not great but good. We followed the recipe exactly except for we did not use fresh oregeno - we used dried. It was a bit salty though and the flavor needed some zest - I am gong to try it again with capers.

I combined this recipe with the chilie and honey chicken recipe. (Due to our lack of some of the ingredients in this recipe). It was a wonderful way to spice up the chicken.

Rating: 4
This is by far my favorite recipe!!!I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and slice them down the middle, then I put the herb butter inside the breast. It comes out juicy and absolutely delicious! In the summer, it tastes awesome on the grill too!

Rating: 4
I doubled the amount of garlic called for the in the recipe, and used cubed chicken and 1 tsp of dried oregano instead, because that was all I had. I melted the butter mixture in a pan and sauteed the chicken in it. I served it with jasmine rice. The house smelled wonderful! Next time I would reserve part of the butter to put on top the chicken, though. This definitely goes on our 'make again' list, especially since it was so quick and easy! Next time I'll definitely try it with fresh oregano, I'm sure it will be even better!

Made it once per recipe with boneless breasts, and it came out tough. Next time around I kept the boneless breasts, but was still able to cut slits. Reduced oil to 1/2 tbsp, and cooked medium low uncovered 4 minutes on each side, then covered for another 6. Second iteration is WAY better, could cut the meat with a fork! It also worked for one to fold the chicken over a pat of the butter mixture. Perfect with some roasted potatoes and blanched vegetables, with a little country french bread.

Rating: 2
Easy and tasty, though hardly anything to write home about. It seemed to lack depth, as the oregano overpowered all else, although, admittedly, I may have added too much. This recipe is, however, definitely good for a weeknight, and I'll certainly make some variation of it again.

To be honest, I have not made this yet. However, I did want to post that the oregano garlic butter is AMAZING when stuffed inside chicken breasts and used in the Garlic Roasted Chicken breast recipe. Delicious!

Mine dried out, and I wasn't particularly impressed with the oregano garlic butter. Not a big fan of white meat to begin with, so maybe that was part of the problem, but this didn't change my mind.

Very good receipe, chicken is very moist. I used boneless chicken breasts and all fresh herbs, though dried them right before using. I aslo combined this receipe with the "garlic-roasted chicken breasts" receipe. Will definitely make again.

We loved this dish! It was fabulous. I have made it several times to rave reviews. The chicken comes out really juicy & the oregano & pepper flakes are a terrific duo !

Rating: 3
Quick, delicious, very juicy, very EASY! i don't like oregano so i used a mix of fresh herbs and it was fine. cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven which seemed a better fit than a regular fry pan for the halved breasts. you could cover it just so and the high walls allowed the meat to cook quickly and evenly.

We just finished snarfing down this wonderful dish and I am happy to report that my husband could only say, "Went down real nice". We followed the recipe to the letter and felt that it had a great flavor. Oh, one change. I took the leftover drippings and reduced it with some dry white wine. I poured it over the chicken on the plate. Nice twist.

This was okay, but my husband and I thought it just doesn't compete with the many good recipes available.

Rating: 2
I blew it! I used 2 cloves of garlic and the raw garlic flavor was overpowering. I also used fresh oregano which is much more subtle than the dried I have on hand. It really was lack luster, except for the over powering raw garlic taste. I would not make it again even if I used the correct amount of garlic.

Rating: 2
My wife enjoys more bland tastes than me and she thought this was pretty good. Myself, I found it a bit short in the flavor and WOW factor. It is a respectable way to cook up chicken, just not the type of full body flavor and appeal that I personally like.

Delicious and easy!

I cut down into the chicken breast and smeared the butter in (no red pepper flakes), and then wrapped it with string so that the butter was in in the middle, added a little salt and pepper and then fried, it was great!

Great recipe! Easy, quick and flavorful. Wonderful for a mid-week meal. I have about 4 or 5 compound butters on hand in the freezer at any given time and they are really yummy. Note to George - this recipe is titled EXACTLY as it is listed on Epicurious. I find that they usually are (I have TiVo, so it's easy for me to double-check the titles). The other way to find the correct recipes is to click on "TV" on the home page, then "This Season's Episodes". It will take you to each show, and then the recipes referenced on each show. VERY quick and user-friendly.

watching the show often then searching for the recipe can be difficult e.g.in this case sauteed v.panfried - I do not think in "panfried" terms It would be very helpful if in the broadcast it was indicated how the recipe would be listed in your 16000+ collection

Simple dish to make with exceptional flavors. I also used the great compound butter to top baked potatoes and vegetable side dishes.

Excellent. And easy. I will make this for my next dinner party. I slow cooked the chicken. Simmer everything, as I've been taught. My first party was a bit impatient, and I had to crank it up in the end, but next time, I will give it just a bit over an hour to cook. And I bet it will be better then the first time.

This was a fantastic recipe, Boyfriend loved it. Can't wait to make it again

I just made this tonight. It was very, very easy. I steamed some veggies, cooked some no-yolk egg noodles, and put the chicken on top (then poured extra juice from pan over it all). When I make this again I think I will chop up some sun-dried tomatoes and stick them inside. I used boneless/skinless breasts, cooked with the cover on the pan, and it took about 7 minutes per side. Terrific.

I followed the recipe as directed, but did use boneless/skinless chicken breast. It worked fine. My Husband said it was good, but not a WOW. I am a vegetarian so I can not rate the taste only the preparation.It was very easy to make and didn't take much time.(That is a plus in my book!)

Outstanding! I also used boneless chicken breasts and dried oregano as others have stated. The chicken was so moist and tender! My boyfriend and his brother gave me the "ultimate" compliment by saying i was as good a cook as thier mother! LOL!

I had boneless skinless breast, and they worked fine. The butter did melt out of the slits, but the flavor stayed with the meat. It was a quick easy chicken to do with asparagus risotto I was preparing.

Used dried oregano but loved it. Even better the next day in a tortilla....

Very easy and delicious! The chicken was moist (I cooked it the entire time with the lid on) and wonderfully buttery - the mixture squirted out like Chicken Kiev when I cut into my breast. Very good with a simple pasta (olive oil, garlic, parmesan, chopped fresh tomatoes), a salad and a loaf of ciabatta.

This was a great and relatively quick dish, and it was MUCH lighter than we expected. We used boneless/skinless breasts and simply covered the pan for the first half of the cooking time. It worked great. When the breasts were turned over, some of the butter naturally melted out into the juices of the pan, but by having the lid on, it didn't burn, plus you leave some of the fat in the pan rather than in the bird, but still get all the flavor. Another tip is to mince the garlic and then mash it in a small bowl with a fork (or mortar/pestle) instead of a knife. This helps retain some of the oil (=flavor!) rather than leaving it on your cutting board. Coarse Kosher-style salt is a must here, too. We had the chicken with just a salad and it proved a wonderful, light summer meal.

This recipe is incredible. Yes, the fat content is kind of high, but it's worth it to try it AT LEAST once (although after, you'll probably be eating it more-just don't send yourself into cardiac arrest :P). I used dried oregano and it was still really good, and I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I used Tabasco (a really odd subsitution, but it was the only spicy that I had on hand), and it still turned out wonderfully. I'm on a low carb diet, so this recipe is perfect and sooo good. This is hands-down a multiple do-over.

This was great. One word of caution: for those of you like me, who usually ups the amount of garlic in recipes, DON'T with this one! I used one clove for two breast halves and it was alot. I served this with capellini tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper, parmesan and chopped fresh tomatoes.

Very easy recipe and delicious. The entire family enjoyed it. i used toothpicks to hold the boneless chicken breast together and deglazed the pan with a little wine and butter and served it over angel hair.

This is very tastey and easy. I did have a slight problem with part of the chicken breast being tough, but the taste is so good, I will try again and not use such thick pieces, or lower the heat a bit. The yummy brown bits in the bottom of the pan prompted a white wine splash to get that flavor, but honestly it was not a contributor, the chicken is excellent on its own.

Wow! You must to try this one. I used dried oregano and bone-in thighs with skin. I will definitely make this again soon.

I pounded the chicken because I usually have no luck sauteeing thick chicken breasts on a moderately high heat without overcooking the outside and undercooking the inside. But after I pounded them, I found it difficult to cut pockets in them...so I ended up cutting each breast in half, sauteeing it a little first in olive oil, and then adding the herb butter to the pieces as they cooked. It went over very well with my husband and guests, and I was confident that I wasn't serving anyone raw chicken. Will make it again the same way. BTW this makes a nice entree alongside the Penne and Vegetable Gratin, also from epi.

This was a wonderful dish -- very flavorful and moist. As the chicken cooked some of the butter snuck out and created and yummy glaze on the chicken!!! I would definitely make this again.
