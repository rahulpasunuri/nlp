This was just OK. I used fresh grated ginger instead of crystallized. I actually added the sugar and lime last, and I think it tasted better with just lime zest added. The sugar and lime seemed to mute and blend all the other flavors, making it sort of bland. This was definitely a case where the combined ingredients were less tasty than the individual ingredients. Not impressed.

Excellent salsa. The only change for us is a bit more jalepeno.

Made it with only cantaloupe (no watermelon) and threw in some chopped red pepper for color. Also extra jalapeno. Yummmmy served w/grilled swordfish.

Delicious summer time recipe. Serve over grilled chicken or fish. Flavors are so great together, spicy and yet refreshing.

This salsa was full of flavor though could have used a little more kick. I used two jalapenos and felt three would have done it. Also, maybe a titch more of the ginger. It look beautiful and was a great variation of salsa for a picnic or bbq.

Great salsa. I add more jalapeno chilis for more spice. I get repeat requests at the office to bring this in. In fact, every summer people ask me to make this. I have started taking a copy of the recipe in when I make it, so people can make their own.

Lately I've really been into fresh fruit salsas-- this one is one of the most delicious I've yet to try. Goes very well with grilled ribs.

Have made it a couple of times; very refreshing on hot summer days. The jalapeno gives it a bit of a kick!

Excellent. Did this with the Bourbon based BBQ ribs (as per the menu in July 2000 BBQ issue of Bon Appetite. Everyone loved it.

I brought this dish to a BBQ and it got rave reviews from all! It was an excellent contrast with smoked beef ribs and spicy fried turkey as the salsa is cool and refreshing. It's also great on its own with the mix of sweet and cool fruit and mint with the spicy vegetables. This is definitely a keeper! The only variation I did was to include both cantelope and honeydew since I like them both and wanted the different colors.
