I served this for Thanksgiving and the tartness of the vinaigrette and freshness of the jicama and oranges were a great compliment to the richness of the turkey and trimmings. I used arugula because I couldn't find watercress. I also sprinkled the jicama generously with chili powder. Delish.

I was heartily disappointed. Fairly boring and a bit bitter.

Note: I used half the amount of oil in the dressing.

As published, I'd give this 2-3 stars because it was a little bland. Sprinkling a little chili powder on top (Mexican or chipotle) kicked this into a 4-star recipe. The chili powder balances the sweetness of the orange and the freshness of the jicama. I'll make this again.

Easy to make, and a nice contrast to rich food. I substituted spring mix for watercress because that is what I had on hand, and it does just fine. If you make the full amount of dressing you will have a lot left over, so I cut it in half. Got great reviews from my extended family.

I made this for Thanksgiving, thinking the citrus would be an nice accent to the turkey. The ingredient combo sounded great but mixed together, all you could taste was lime juice. Probably won't make this again.
