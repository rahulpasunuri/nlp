one of my favorite southeast asian dishes and this tastes great. Instead of making my own turnip cakes, I used pre-(home)made ones from the chinese market and it worked great.

Pretty authentic recipe. The "cake" takes a while to make but there isn't much effort involved. Next time I would use less oil. I omitted the kecap manis because I prefer the "white" version which doesn't have the sweetness of the kecap manis. I also added some sesame oil at the end for flavor and cooked the eggs in a separate non stick pan and mixed it in with the fried carrot cake at the end.

I LOVED this dish. Wasn't quick or easy but will definitely make again for a special and unusal brunch for guests...
