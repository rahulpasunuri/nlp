Very nice, simple recipe. I used Empire apples - about a dozen smallish ones in a 3lb bag. Easy to make adjustments to the recipe according to taste -- I threw in chopped pecans and almonds, and also added cinnamon. Basting often is key. Good for breakfast/brunch or dessert.

I sort of followed the reviewer who marinated the raisins. I marinated cranraisins in grand marnier,brown sugar and orange juice overnight. The fruit was nice and plump and then I filled the apples and added plenty of brown sugar. Basted it every 10-15 minutes. Everyone wanted the recipe. This is a keeper!

I thought this recepie had potential but as written sounded "bland" I marinaded the raisins overnight in triple sec and brown sugar with 6 cinnamon sticks, latter inserted between the raisins ( Californian Gold) into each apple. I topped off this mixture with brown sugar tightly packed around the raisins. When cooking I basted every 10 minutes through cooking time of 1 hr 10 mins but found that larger Mackintosh was best suited. I also cooked some apples with a "corkscrew" peel-i.e leaving 1/2 flesh exposed-this gave best results than 1/2 peeled or unpeeled-I tried all ways in the test . A drop of Marsala on each apple 1/2 way through cooking gave good results than ones not treated this way.Enjoy!! Mike

I used Gala apples, dark brown sugar and dark raisins. The best part of it was the plump, chewy raisins in the bottom. It wasn't extraordinary but I think it would make a nice dish at Thanksgiving for its presentation. I'll certainly add some cinnamon next time, though.

Did not like these at all. The extra raisins on the bottom burnt. It needed cinnimon. It did not have much flavor.

This dish is delicious. We made this on Halloween, to have something sweet other than candy, and the aroma is out of this world! I added some walnuts, which worked perfectly.

Very good baked apples--used Fujis, dark raisins, dark brown sugar, and a sprinkling of powdered ginger before the first basting. When done, I thought the leftover cider was a little thin, so I boiled it with an extra dollop of butter, a dash of honey, and a little cornstarch, then drizzled that over the apples. Excellent--my favorite baked apple.

I served this recipe at an Oktoberfest meal 42 guests. The only thing I changed was to add cinnamon before baking the Granny Smith apples. It was a hit. I will serve it again.

I love this dish. Although I would add some pecans and cinnamon to it. Its great on those cold a wintry days.

Decrease the sugar by half and substitute a light sprinkle of red hots to each apple. We like to add grape-nuts cereal to give it crunch & uncooked oat meal to increase nutriative value.

This one looked too sweet from first glance, so I spiced it up by spiking the apples' cavities with a few cloves and a cinnamon stick then filling them with the raisin mixture in which I used only half of the prescribed sugar. It was delicious--and I love the way the pat of butter gives the apples a lovely golden brown sheen.

My mom use to make this for us as kids. I loved it when she made it cause the whole house smelled of baked apples. Great dish.
