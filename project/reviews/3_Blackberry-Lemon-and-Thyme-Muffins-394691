Blackberry, Lemon and Thyme combination is killer. Texture and density of the muffins leaves something to be desired. Next time I plan on using a tried and true base for the muffin and add blackberries, lemon and thyme to it

Mine didn't look like the picture either, though they browned a bit. They did not look like a yellow fungus per the earlier reviewer but not quite ready for prime time either. The taste, however, was great. It is different than other flavor combinations but in a good way. I didn't have problems with density and found they came out lighter and fluffier than other muffin recipes. I thought the light muffins and crunch of the crumble made a nice combination of textures.

Marella, I am the person who didn't get the addition of egg yolk in the topping. I still don't. I'm making these again without the egg yolk. No other crumb topping ever adds that. I hope you have good luck with your next batch, but I think adding MORE yolk will be a bad idea.

Same issues as others reported. Topping looked sickly. Also, thyme was a bit bitter in the topping. I would reduce amount of thyme in the topping, add more sugar. I guess the egg is supposed to keep topping holding together but it didn't do much. Would probably add another egg yolk to see if that helps.

These are hard to review just for the fact that they look nothing like the photo. The tops did not brown at all and looked like some odd yellow fungus on top. The muffins are very good though. I thought I was gonna eat all the batter which was better than the baked product.Umm I'm not sure I'd be excited to serve at any special event due to looks. I don't get the use of the egg yolk in the crumb topping, haven't seen that before. But strangely, I will make these again for my family because they have an interesting flavor and they're also easy to bang out.

These are dense muffins and the topping didn't brown up. However, the flavor is wonderful.
