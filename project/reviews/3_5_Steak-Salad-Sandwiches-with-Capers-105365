I used hanger steak, sourdough bread toasted, topped with roasted garlic, steak salad, tomatoes and prevolone cheese then placed under the broiler as an open-faced sandwich. Yum.

i grilled a couple tenderloins along with the bread and served this as a main dish salad with the bread on the side - it was absolutely delicious!

Great sandwich to make with left over beef. My variation was with red leaf lettuce and pita bread. Will definately make again.

Made this with leftover grilled steak. It was quite good, but I would crush the capers to give the sauce more flavor. If you oversauce it, the steak gets lost. I will make again with leftover steak.
