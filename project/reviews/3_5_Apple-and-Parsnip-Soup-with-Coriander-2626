This is an OK recipe; I certainly ate the whole batch. It definitely will need thinning after pureeing, so be sure to have some extra stock on hand. The parsley is a must -- it needs the green, vegetal accent. I tried it with several different serving accents: creme fraiche, balsamic vinegar, fruit chutney; the balsamic was the most successful (but be sure to use a very light hand). What I didn't try but think would be very good is a gremalata ...

I made it as it says and I think it would taste better with a sweeter apple with a small amount of tart like a Pink Lady.

Really good and fairly easy to make. Finished soup reminds me for some reason of turkey stuffing with apples. ... without the turkey of course!

I made as written and thought it was pretty bland. I guess I'll stick to butternut squash bisque as my fall staple.

I had 22 lbs of Macoun apples and was very done making pies. Macoun + Parsnip did the trick. I added a boiling potato, garlic, shallots, an a dash of cumin. Really excellent soup. Perfect for an autumn night. Don't skip cilantro - adds a really nice kick.

So good! I added a potato, some fennel and a leek, just because I had them around and to add a bit of interest. I also added a bit of half and half and a splash of sherry at the end. Delicious on a rainy winter night.

Very similar in taste to the Parsnip Bisque also found on this site, but sweeter. A bit too sweet and simple in flavor for me, I'm afraid, but pleasant all the same. And easy, certainly.

Wonderful soup. I used leek instead of onion and added the coriander only after it was blended. The coriander adds a delicate flavor that works so well with the parsnip. Really great for the whole family

This soup was very easy, but prepared as written, it's mediocre at best. I used hand-picked macoun apples, fresh-from-the-farm parsnips, and fresh cilantro. It was still kind of a dud. I livened it up as suggested with some cayenne, a few red pepper flakes and a TB of honey. Served with bread. Probably not something I'd make again.

This was really easy and my husband and I both loved it for a cooler October evening in Minnesota!!! I also added 3 cloves of garlic. Delicious!

Tasty and easy. I did add a clove of chopped garlic and a half teaspoon of grated ginger, and replaced the butter with bacon grease. I'll definately make this again- a great fall soup.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving and thought it was wonderful. I did nor blend it completely, so that it would have bit of texture left in it and not be too babyfood-like. It got great reviews from all of the guests. And it was even better the next day.

I was a little bit concerned about the recipe being a bit thin on flavor initially, so I added a clove of garlic, plus a little ground fennel and cayenne. It really became a very complex and delicious soup with these additions. I will definitely be making it again (I also canned it to preserve the soup, so I got about 8 individual meals out of the recipe)

Fabulous soup! Rich and flavourful.

This probably would have been better if I'd had the whole amount of parsnips to offset the tartness of the Granny Smiths. I could only find 1# of parsnips and used the 1.5# of apples. I also used whole cardamom as I didn't have time to crush it. The taste was good but it was extremely acidic. My son wouldn't eat it. It it hadn't been so acidic - tasted like a cup of vinegar was added - it would have been quite good. Will try again with more parsnips or less apple (as recipe states!)

Surprisingly good. Made this because I came across some beautiful, plump, fresh parsnips in a local produce store. They were so sweet (sweeter than the apples) that I had to add a little lemon juice at the end to offset it. The ground coriander contributed to the overall flavor without being identifiable. Even those who are usually indifferent to parsnips liked this soup.

We compete with some friends of ours in and variation of Iron Chef Battle. This dish was part of our winning line-up for Apple Battle. If you want to be daring, try smoking the apples first. It's easier than it sounds- buy some wood chips suitable for a smoker, put them in the bottom of a large stock pot (not non-stick) over low heat. Once the chips begin to smoke, place the apples in a steamer basket over the chips and cover the pot. Let them smoke about ten minutes.

This was very good. I had had a spectacular parsnip and apple soup a couple of weeks before at a restaurant in NYC and was trying to recreate that soup. This came close after I added some chunks of Honeycrisp apple--the apple flavor wasn't right. Perhaps I should have used the Gala or Granny Smith apples.

Super soup - have made it many times. Yesterday, I subbed pears for the apples and it was a taste sensation! Mmmmm what a treat! Try it, you won't believe how delicious it is with pears!

This soup is delicious!

The marriage of parsnips & apples was helped immeasurably with the addition of the cilantro. Definitely a keeper. Can be served either hot or chilled.

Yummy! The parsnips give it a wonderful flavor. Even without the coriander (which I forgot to add) it's delicious.
