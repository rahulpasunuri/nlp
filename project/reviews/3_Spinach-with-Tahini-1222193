Delicious, though I took the suggestions of the others and used more lemon and garlic but less water. Adding cumin really made a difference as well. Certainly going to make this again.

This is an exceptional recipe. Even our picky 9 year old son loves it!

I love this recipe. I eliminated the sesame seeds, the tahini is enough. I mainly make it with Swiss chard, but I have made it with spinach and sometimes with broccoli or cauliflower. My husband and I love this sauce so much I usually make extra.

Easy and different. Will make again. Used these proportions for 1 10 oz bag of spinach which was fine for 2 people. Definitely cut water in "dressing" to 2 T. If it seems to thick, don't sqeeze out all the spinach cooking liquids. Steaming, blanching, whatever. Will maek again.

This was good, but not great. I made chicken satay w/peanut sauce, and this was too busy with that entree. I should have paired it with a grilled fish entree.

I would use less or no water next time and more lemon juice - I agree that it was way too runny. Also, I made it with red chard -- wouldn't do that again as it turned the sauce pink. It still tasted good, but it looked pretty weird. Cumin or cayenne is another good idea.

This was good, but this was my first time using tahini, and I had to wrestle with the can to scoop it out and remix with the oil it had separated from. Is this normal for tahini?

This recipe gets good marks for being amazingly easy, but the finished product is nothing special. I would reduce the amount of water in the sauce by half as it's a bit too thin and runs right off the spinach. Still an easy and colourful side dish for a weekend dinner, and the tahini gives the spinach a fantastic nutty flavour.

Tried the recipe with swiss chard from the garden; otherwise, as written. It was bland, but had potential. Next time, a little more lemon to brighten, maybe some cumin or cayenne to add other interest.

Who needs creamed spinach? This is just as richly smooth, and suitable for vegans and meat-eaters alike - delicious! We like our greens well-flavored, so added an additional garlic clove, a couple more pinches of salt, and two dashes of hot pepper sauce - just right - otherwise it would be too bland for us. And if you're ever feeling lazy and short of time - the sauce works just as well with a box of defrosed chopped spinach - you'll just have a few tablespoons left to use as as a yummy salad dressing the next day thinned with a little more lemon juice and water. Such a versatile recipe!
