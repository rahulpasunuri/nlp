I make this recipe every Christmas to bring to my cuban friend's annual pig roast. I get nothing but rave reviews from both seasoned flan connesiuers to first timers! The pumpkin and gingersnaps realy give it a taste of the season.

This was just OK. My husband who always loves to eat dessert thought it was too sweet.

Awesome. This is my favorite flan recipe. I use anout 3/4 of a can of pumpkin and add a little bit of vanilla. The gingersnap crust adds texture and a wonderful spicy flavor.

I followed the recepie carefuly and did not achieve a smooth flan surface. Taste was good.

Didn't have gingersnaps so left off that bit and was still a huge hit - every bit gone.

Delicious, however 1 pound of gingersnaps made too much crust. There was enough crust to make at least 2, maybe 3 flans. I made it again today, with 1/3 the crust recipe.

A great hit! Found that there was enough filling/crust left over after 6 ramekins to make a loaf-pan worth.

The gingersnap crust and pumpkin lent a unique touch to traditional Spanish flan that I so love. I used canned pumpkin and 2%milk. This is a wonderful recipe!

YUMMY! I lightened this up by using lowfat condensed milk, fat free evaporated milk and 4 eggs and 4 egg whites. I didn't make the crust, and it was very good even so. I used canned pumkin. It was very yummy, everyone raved!
