This was a waste of a good aubergine. Just don't do it. And it def needs more grilling than that!

This is a great sandwich that makes me look foward to lunchtime while at work! I also use watercress instead of arugula and it tastes GREAT. add a dash of hot pepper flakes too, mmm!!!! easy. delicious.

To make it even easier, use store bought hummus. Very heathy and nice change from ham & cheese.

This sandwich had a very unique flavor. It was a nice change from your regular meat/cheese sandwiches. I would definitely recommend trying this for something new and light.

Very tasy and quick. I wish restaurants would serve sandwiches like this instead of the usual, boring "smoked turkey and cheese".
