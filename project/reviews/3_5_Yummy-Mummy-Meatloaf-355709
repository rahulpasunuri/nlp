Very nice idea for Halloween. You can use a different recipe for the meatloaf if you prefer.

The meatloaf recipe was OK, but the fun was in wrapping it up in noodles. I added more olives to the meat mixture with some feta and herbs. The adults had as much fun as my child. Will use the idea again for Halloween themed dinner.

Easy to make and delicious. I changed the size to be individual meatloaves which cut the cooking time. My kids enjoyed helping me place the pasta over the meat, and decorate.

We served this at the Halloween party in 2009 and not only did the adults like it but the kids did too. My boys ate black olives without complaint for the first time that night. I added an extra can of tomato paste to make it a little more "tart" but other than that, the recipe is pretty satisfying! And it looks cool.

this was so much fun to make and eat. I made my own favorite turkey loaf, then followed the rest of the directions. kids wrapped the mummies and we all loved this recipe.

Easy to make and very kid-friendly. Lean ground turkey tasted great in place of the ground beef. We skipped the dipping sauce because the sauce on top was enough for us. Using the measurements listed, the sauce was tasty and smelled great as the kids waited for it to finish cooking.
