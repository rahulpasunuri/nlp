I make this with vegetable broth, half and half, add 1/3 c. parmesan and 1/2 t. thyme and let it sit for half an hour to firm up. Then I serve it with a black bean, corn and fresh tomato salsa. Sounds like a strange combination, but everyone has seconds!

My parents, grandparents and theirs have been making polenta for a very long time. They add either kidney beans or browned Italian sausage chunks toward the end of the polenta's cooking process. (Personally, I enjoy the polenta without those additions.) Once cooked, the polenta is spread out to about an inch and a half thick, then topped with fresh Marinara sauce and plenty of freshly grated Pecorino Romano sprinkled on top of the sauce.

Made this with frozen corn and it worked out great! I also used 1/2 & 1/2, and think next time I will try it with milk. Needed to add some more liquid, however my dinner guests loved it. A KEEPER & REPEATER!

Roasted the corn first by soaking it in the husk for 30 min and then grilled in the husk for 15 minutes & mixed it in right at the end. Came out great.

To add to my previous post, I will say I used canned corn - and only one standard sized can of corn. The recipe probably called for a bit too much actual corn...

This polenta is a KILLER recipe. I've used it a few times. I usually stir in a combination of whichever cheese I have on hand right at the end. The chicken broth / cream liquid base is what gives it such awesome flavor. The use of corn adds texture and is really visually pleasing as well. A+!

3 forks because I don't know what type of polenta requires this much time to cook, but mine (Polenta Valsugana), was done in less than 10 minutes, so I suggest you tweak the recipe to suit the cooking instructions on the brand you use. I first roasted the corn, and believe it enhanced the flavor (and added some colorful specs in an otherwise monotone dish), since I was serving this with braised lamb. I also added parmesan cheese, then filled ramekins, a wee bit of parmesan on top and baked at 350 for 10 minutes. Made a nice polenta cake, which was a lovely presentation.

Oh my gosh! Just get a spoon and dig in for this one. Absolutley perfect--I substituted half and half for the cream but otherwise stayed with the recipe. It is to die for!!

It seems like people are pretty divided about polenta - either love it or hate it - so I was a little reluctant to serve it at a dinner party (alongside a pork with cherry balsamic sauce - lovely!). Every plate was scraped clean and guests were asking for more.

Really good and easy. Used the leftovers to make a corn polenta cake the next day. Spread leftover in a greased baking pan and pop in the fridge. The next day bake 10-15 min. in a 350 oven. Could also try to do "polenta corn cakes with Wild Mushroom Pan Roast "21" club."

I liked this a lot. It was very good (almost a 3 1/2 forks). It was a little dry so I had to add a little more chicken broth & I thought it was too much corn so I didn't add all of it. Other than that it was great. I served it with BBQ chicken.

This recipe is a definite keeper! Super easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. It had my husband-a confirmed polenta and grits hater--eating third helpings.

Finished the recipe with a good handful of fresh grated Vacche Rosse Parmigiano, otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Guests raved; almost to my dismay, there were no leftovers. Will definitely make again, as it's sure to be even better when made with same-day-fresh corn.

I made this recipe for my husband and I as part of a romantic dinner. It was outstanding!! I couldn't stop eating it. I used Red Mill Coarse Cornmeal and cooked it as directed. Again, I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

Fantastic - the corn now a days is almost like eating sugar.....so I used 5 ears instead of 3. This rates with comfort food!!!

I poured the polenta into an oiled baking dish and when completely cold, pan fried squares of the polenta, yum, yum, it was delicious with the Tuscan Chicken.

Great side dish. Even early spring Florida corn was good. Can hardly wait for August's fresh corn, picked the same day.
