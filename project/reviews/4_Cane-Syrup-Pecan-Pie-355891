I have now made this recipe three times and it has turned out perfectly, each time. A beautiful pie packed with flavor. Cane syrup (I use Lyle's) makes for a MUCH more flavorful pie than corn syrup! This is my go-to pecan pie recipe.

My husband loves pecan pie and I've tried many, many recipes over the years looking for a pie that wasn't cloyingly sweet. The search is over, this one is incredible. I used Lyle's Golden Syrup, dark rum, and store-bought crust. Beat with a mixer, but let it rest for a few minutes before I popped it in the oven Definitely making again.

This pie was incredible - the texture and richness of the filling was divine! It received rave reviews at our Thanksgiving dinner. Thrilled to finally have a pecan pie recipe to make for years to come!

Served this at Thanksgiving. It was such a hit among our crowd that we made a second one. Not too sweet. Perfect!

My Grandmother from Alabama always made pecan pie with cane syrup. It's the traditional way. The cane syrup works especially well with the bourbon and brown sugar (Grandmother never used bourbon!) ;)

No review because I haven't made it yet, but I have a question and don't know where else to ask. The recipe does not say, so for those who have made it, is this for a regular or deep dish pie? I have a 9", 2" deep pie plate I want to use and need to know if I am going to have adjust this recipe or not. Thank you!

Amazing - best pecan pie I have ever had and the recipe is spot on an very simple.

Another reviewer mentioned that they'd substituted golden syrup for the cane syrup: finally, something to do with that can of Lyle's! The result was very sweet but with a great clear, rich flavor -- much tastier than the kinds I've made before. I also doubled the chopped pecans and soaked them in bourbon for an hour before adding them to the filling. That was fantastic. Next year I'll plan ahead and buy the cane syrup but otherwise I'll keep it exactly as is.

I have found a very similar recipe which uses Prichard's Fine Rum. The recipe can be found here: http://prichardsdistillery.com/recipes.cfm

This is simply the best pecan pie recipe I've ever eaten...and I've eaten many!

Voted as the best pecan pie ever by myself and everyone who tasted my rendition of this pie. I would venture to say this might possibly be the best recipe I've ever used. Though to be honest, I did let the bottle run over a bit when I measured out the bourbon. Don't bother making this if you don't make your own crust... it would be a shame to waste such a lovely filling on a mediocre pastry. I didn't have any trouble with the marshmallow effect (beat mine by hand) and the gooey caramel center did something fabulous with the buttery pie crust that words just cannot explain.

The best pie I've ever made. Ever. I'll admit I was a little loose on the measurements-maybe heavy on the butter, the pecans, and the bourbon, and a little light on the syrup. But really--OMG this was so good. I used a large shallow ceramic tart pan, and I think that made it even better. Also my crust came out well, which surely contributed to the fireworks going off on my tongue. I think the marshmallow problem is definitely due to using a machine mixer. I mixed mine by hand with a whisk and had no marshmallow blow out issues- but I also had almost no air bubbles in my mix. I have a gas oven that never gets quite hot enough, and heats only from below, so I didn't have any issues with a burnt top, and the bottom of my crust caramelized with the gooey filling. Did I mention how awesome this recipe is?

I've made this recipe about 5 times now. I haven't had any issues with burnt pecans on the top, but I have experienced the "marshmallow fluffing" effect. I figured out that it happens because the filling is too fluffy and full of air. The solution is to let the pie rest for a good 40-60 minutes after you pour in the filling, before you bake it. I believe the freshness of your eggs may also effect how fluffy it gets / how long it takes to rest. I find bourbon preferable to rum in this recipe. I have made it with Lyle's Golden Syrup, and also with home-made "cane syrup" from this recipe: http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/tips-techniques/pantry-staples-diy-cane-sugar-syrup-131934

This is one toothsome recipe. It is fabulous. Not only would I make it again but I have!

I can't rate this recipe because I don't know if I did something wrong or if the recipe is wrong. I have made pecan pie many times before but this was my first time trying this recipe. About 30 mins into the cooking time, it started to puff up like a marshmallow and it charred and burnt like a marshmallow. I followed the recipe so I'm not sure what happened. I feel like the temperature was too high or something. Obviously, I couldn't serve a burnt pie, so it was of no use to me. That being said, the non-burnt inside of the pie was the best pecan pie I have ever had! The filling is so creamy and smooth in texture. Also, the flavor is amazing. However, until I figure out what went wrong, I can't make this again. I followed the recipe exactly and I am an experienced baker and I make pecan pie every year. I beat the mixure in my KitchenAid for 10 mins until it looked fluffy. It turned the color of dijon mustard--maybe I beat it too long? Who knows... Anyways... disappointing that it puffed and burned like a marshmallow. But the flavor and texture of the insides was amazing!

Everyone loved this pie. It's not as sweet as ones made with corn syrup and the rum is a nice touch. My new favorite pecan pie.

I had never made a pecan pie before, so I didn't know to cover the top; the pecans are between overly-toasty and straight up burnt. Otherwise, it's a lovely pie and very tasty, just know to slap some aluminum foil on top for half the baking time or so (also put another pan under the pie plate, as the filling may leak over a bit too).

This is the best tasting pecan pie I have ever eaten! It is so rich and carmelly, and the bourbon is a perfect accent. I chose this recipe because I was looking for an alternative to corn syrup, and I was more than satisfied with the result.
