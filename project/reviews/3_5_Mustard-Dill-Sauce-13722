I was looking for a recipe where I could use quite a bit of dill. It was fast to whip up and I just added a pinch of salt to taste. Yummy!

Well, I made this and thought it was quite tasty, then looked at the recipe and realized I had left out the sugar. Didn't add it after reading other reviews, but did add a bit of lemon juice, meyer lemon, maybe 1 tablespoon. Three of us liked it quite a bit.

This was a little thin but absolutely full of fabulous flavour. Took my salmon cakes over the moon because of its robust and bold flavour. Loved it but might make with low fat sour cream next time.

I thought the taste was a little off, sort of like it needed to be 'cooked'. I warmed it in the microwave for 1 minute: that worked fine. I also added some horseradish. Maybe next time I'll sautee some chopped shallots and add the sauce ingredients for a variation on this sauce.

I substituted tarragon for the dill. It wasn't bad, but I agree with a previous reader that something was off. I think the mustard overpowered the sauce. Perhaps less mustard next time...

I thought this tasted really strange. The combination of flavours was just off... the sugar + mustard overpowered the dill, and the whole thing was watery and unappetizing. Won't make it again.

It was great. There was no salmon so i did it with Tylapia, it was great, everyone loved it.

We loved the sauce on salmon. We also served it with steamed broccholi and red potatoes. We'll make this again for sure.

Substituted with dijon mustard, adjusting the amount to taste. Served it with salmon papillotes with julienned mixed vegetables. Wonderful flavors...

Coarse grained mustard a must. Sugar to taste - I found the amount suggested too much. Thicken leftovers with sour cream for next day munching with raw veggies.

I just wanted to remind people that they are not confined to the recipe's ingredient list. You can all actually use fat-free half-and-half, and you will cut out the majority of saturated fats from the recipe. As it stands, the benefits of the Omega-3 fatty acids are practically only enough to counteract the negative effects of the sat fats in the heavy cream. Fat-free half-and-half is really an easy alternative...Maybe not for special occasions, but perfect for the average night.

Too much mustard - it completely overpowers the dill, not to mention the fish it is intended to enhance. Perhaps mixing in sour cream to cut the mustardy taste would be helpful.

I've made this twice and it has been spectacular both times. Roasting the salmon in the broiler is a fantastic way to cook it. I added about 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper to the dill sauce and used half of the sugar. Made rice pilaf and served with salmon on warm platter.

Excellent. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added less sugar. Delicious with the salmon, but I can see that it would be great with steak or chicken, too.

This sauce MADE the salmon!!! I did 1/2 the receipe and only used 1 tsp of sugar. It was just wonderful. Definitely a "keeper".

Nice sauce for the broiled salmon. I halved the recipe and it was plenty for 3 filets. I used whole grain mustard and substituted white wine for the water in the recipe. Definitely reduce the sugar.

Limit the sugar and this is a great dill sauce. Easy to prepare and save for the next time.

Great sauce for fish, chicken, maybe even lamb chops. I served it with the Broiled Salmon recipe. Based on other reviews I reduced the sugar to half and it added a nice subtle flavor. Well worth a repeat.

the only thing I would chane about this recipe, is adding a white "dry" wine to the sauce as a base...

This Mustard Dill Sauce recipe is too sweet for my taste. The Mustard Dill Sauce that is linked to the Oven Poached Salmon is much better.

Rating: 3
Very good sauce. I used it with red steelhead trout. Went over real good. I did follow the lead of the more experienced cooks (I'm a retired novice cook) and cut the sugar back to 1 tsp. I think any more would have been too sweet. Since we had a lot left over, I am going to follow the lead of others and develop it into salad dressing.

A good sauce for the salmon. I used 1/4 cup coarse-grained dijon mustard (already on the sweet side) and 2 tsp. of sugar. One of our dinner guests said he doesn't like mustard but I saw him pouring this sauce over his salmon.

yum!!!!!! lOVED IT- Used Basil instead of thyme and served with fresh asparagus. The flavor of the salmon really came out nicely.

This was an excellent sauce for the attached salmon recipe. As some readers suggested, I lessened the sugar addition (just added bits until I thought it tasted right).

This sauce was fabulous. My very picky mother loved it as well as everyone else. I took other's suggestions - made half and had plenty, used very little sugar, and dried dill. It was a natural with salmon.

Wonderful Recipe! Made the sauce and used it with Salmon Steaks. Very easy to make and very tasty!

I used "light" cream to reduce fat content and used just a sprinkling of sugar, and took another reviewer's tip and briefly microwaved the sauce to thicken it slightly - very, very good!

Rating: 4
This is a winner. An interesting flavor presentation. I might work on reducing the fat content however! Can I get away with less creama and still have great results?

My husband really liked the sauce. I put half Dijon and half coarse-grained mustard. It made more strong mustard taste. I put only 1 tsp. of suger. IT'S EASY & TASTY!!

My husband and I thought this was great. My 12 year old son liked it, too, but only in a small amount. I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough mustard, and it was more than enough for the 1 1/2 pounds of salmon we had. Wonderful - we'll definitely have this again (might reduce the sugar next time, though).

Made this tonight for dinner. My husband doesn't usually like salmon and he licked his plate! It only took 20 minutes from start to finish - so its super easy. We'll be adding it to our repertoire of meals to make with a baby underfoot (fast, easy & good!)

I used 1% milk for the water and cream and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. A mix of dijon and horseradish mustard, 1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp., 1 Tbsp. of sugar and 1 Tbsp. dried dill. I didn't change the oil. I heated it for approx. 3 min.on high in the microwave, 1 min. at a time, stirring each time to thicken slightly. We ate it room temp. and my 12 yr. old loved the sauce! Thanks - absolutely delicious with salmon.

Definitely a must when we have broiled salmon. Go easy on the mustard!

Wonderful flavours! I served this on freshly caught salmon and it was devine. The only change I would do for next time, is cut the recipe in half and adjust the sugar. Made way to much sauce; but then I could serve it on chicken, vegetables, etc......the list is endless!

This recipe is excellent! I substituted basil for the dill and it was delicious on both salmon and also on chicken! I have made this recipe many times now and friends consistently rave about how good it is. And it's so easy! I have also substituted half and half for the cream and it tastes just as delicious. I think you definitely have to be a mustard fan to truly appreciate this recipe though.

Given the raving reviews, I feel I need to add a word of caution - not everybody likes it. I followed the recipe, and used high quality ingredients. Nobody liked it. The mustard overpowered the dill, and I was unable to fix it.

This sauce was excellent, I substituted half and half for the whipping cream. I can't wait to make it again. Everyone loved this, it tasted like something from a fancy restaurant.

I loved this recipe!! It was easy and the sauce was yummy!!! There was plenty of sauce leftover so the following night I mixed it with a little balsamic vinegar and olive oil and it made a great salad dressing! I will definitely make this dish again.

Very good but a tad too sweet for my tastes. I think next time I'll leave out the sugar and add more mustard.

I made this dish two nights ago and my husband raved. To be quite honest with you I agreed whole heartedly how amazing it was. The dill mustard sauce complimented the salmon beautifully. I would make it for company over and over. I will just have to invite many friends over instead of having them all at once. Just to let you know I made it again tonight and I had to just let you know how much I appreciate the recipe.

This sauce is a snap but very flavorful. Makes for an elegant presentation when spooned over the salmon. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Highly recommended.

My husband & I both love this sauce with the salmon. We substitute 1% milk for the cream, however, and it still comes out great.

My husband and I thought this sauce would go better with chicken rather than the salmon. It was still good with the salmon, but would really be better with chicken.

THIS WAS ESPECIALLY EASY TO PREPARE AND SIMPLY DELICIOUS. I SUBSTITUTED NUTRA SWEET FOR THE SUGAR AND ADDED DICED PEELED AND SEEDED CUCUMBERS FOR A BIT MORE TEXTURE.
