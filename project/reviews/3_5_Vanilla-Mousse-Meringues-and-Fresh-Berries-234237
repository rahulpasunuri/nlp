I've made this recipe twice now. The first time, I followed it exactly (with the exception of reducing the total sugar in the meringues to 1 1/2 cups). It got rave reviews, and a request from my guests for the recipe.

Is no one concerned about the risk of salmonella from the raw egg white?

was looking for a light dessert, and this seemed to fit the bill.... did not make meringeues as time did not permit, so instead picked up some real nice almond crisp cookies from Trader Joes -- they looked like bakery quality, not boxed.... made the rest as directed, although I too did not blanch orange -- pour quoi? Used Greek Fage brand yogurt (which is thick and pre- strained) yet still strained in cheese cloth as directed, although, for only 2 hours, again due to time constraints... would have been better to strain a bit more, as the mousse did not hold its form (kind of spread on plate). Also, balked at the $5 per berry carton price, so used some glorious blackberries (found for $3.69) and used fresh chopped mango and papaya, that I already had on hand. Strawberry coulis was good -- used squeeze bottle to drizzle/squirt into a design on bottom of plate. Then spooned dollups of mousse on top of that, scattered good amount of fruit/berries around dollups, propped almond cookie in mousse and garnished w/ mint sprig. nice presentation - mousse is very light tasting - might consider doing a very small drizzle of balsamic glaze on fruit next time.... for a little kick... and also for the variation of color on the plate -- try this one out, and be a bit creative w/ it - I believe people just plain like the sound of "vanilla mousse" - when I announced dessert, there were a lot of "oohhhh, vanilla mousse!" exclamations from my guests. Not only must something taste good, it should also be pleasing to the ears and eyes as well!

Wonderful! The strawberry coulis is a dramatic, delicious touch. I agree: one meringue is enough, no need to blanch the orange. Very easy to make with a gourmet presentation. If you have too much meringue batter, fold in some chocolate and dried cranberries and bake in the oven for meringue crisps.

The Vanilla Mousse is terrific and super easy, but no need to get fussy blanching orange julienne; just make plain ol' box grater fine zest. Two meringues makes too much of an ultra-sweet dessert. Next time, I'll use one--nobody could figure out how to eat it and keep it on the plate, and few people finished it. Needs to be a smaller presentation, although it is dramatic and beautiful. Next time, I'll also drizzle chocolate--why not?! The Bergomot mint sprigs right out of the garden were also a big hit as they offset the sweet. Served with an orange muscat, which is NOT going to be the wine of choice. I suggest a Prosecco.

I used a squeeze bottle to drizzle the strawberry mixture over the top, and it did look terrific. Also, the taste was good. In retrospect, I would have used much less sugar in the mousse mixture - maybe 1/2 cup. The orange flavor was terrific. Also, I made the whole thing the day before - meringues, mousse, and coulis - so just assembled and served. Usually I'm a chocolate dessert person, but I'll make this again.

I only read the recipe, but it really looks good. The recipe makes more sense if you realize that you click on Meringues and Strawberry Coulis to get to those recipes. I like the fact you can do so much ahead, and this is a perfect Easter dessert.

Read the recipe with interest, but there is something missing. There are no instructions for cooking the merigues. It appears as though the titles are out of sequence as well. Will there be a reprint or should we follow a standard cooking proceedure?
