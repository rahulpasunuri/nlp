I'm not usually much on sweet salads, but this one is fantastic! I made it for a family dinner and everyone raved!

My grandmother used to make this for me - I add potatoes, garlic and onion just like one of the reviewers said - it's always outstanding....and you can do this on top of the stove or in a crock pot - and yes it's fool proof.

I salivate re-reading this recipe. One important change. Dump the kraut into the bottom of the dish, place the ribs on top and squeeze BBQ sauce on the ribs. Cover for 1-1/2 hours, then continue to bake uncovered for another 1/2 hour. Yum Yummy!

I added quartered potatoes, garlic and onions. The flavor was very good and without draining the kraut, it wasn't too salty or sour. The BBQ sauce added a nice spicy tang. This was an easy dish to make for that after-work dinner. The three hours baking time was exact for my oven also.

Write up says one thing (don't drain) and list of ingredients states "drained" ??

Amazing flavor for so little work! Next time I will use more sauerkraut. I used boneless pork shoulder country-style ribs and they were very meaty and good. I will definitely make it again (soon, because I have 1/2 bottle of BBQ sauce to use up).

I have to say... very good! And to think that the main work involved opening a can (the sauerkraut, of which I only used half, by the way)! Rarely have I worked so little to get so much taste. I highly recommend this recipe!

I partially drained the sauerkraut and placed it on the bottom of the dish with the ribs on top. I covered the whole dish and slowly cooked it as directed. I think the kraut steamed the ribs and infused them with more flavor. Delicious!

I've been making this for years & years. Didn't realize there was a recipe for it. I started out wanting to use up some bbq sauce. The sweet/sour taste is great! I also cook in my slow cooker. House smells wonderful! Finger lickin' good!

Cooking ribs has always intimadated me but not with this recipe. It's frequently the requested dinner from my kids.

So what is the big deal? Spareribs and sauerkraut is an old German recipe that I and many Germans have been making for years. The barbecue sauce is completely unnecessary. It is better without it. Just ribs and kraut. Sprinkle a few caraway seeds on top before baking.

While this was incredibly easy, it was not outstanding. I used "bagged" sauerkraut, rather than canned, but otherwise followed exactly. I used our household favorite barbecue sauce too. It certainly was tender, but somewhat flavorless! I may try one more time, with a different brand of kraut, but it just didn't have the "zing" I was expecting. If I do repeat, I'll follow the suggestions in the notes from the test kitchen, and baste frequently. Perhaps the juices will add flavor?

As good as predicted. Used baby back ribs which cooked faster. Everyone had thirds, at least.
