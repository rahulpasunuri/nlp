A delicious and easy mid-week pasta meal! Made two modifications: used chopped fresh basil vs dried (I had it on hand) and I used 2 cups in total of the chicken broth. I cooked one cup in the pasta when it was still firm (added a lot of flavour to the actual pasta) until it was al dente, and the other cup I added to the sausage/onion/garlic mixture and reduced it slightly to intensify it's flavour. My children loved this with my son eating two helpings, yet it had a lot of flavour to please an adult palette. Absolutely will make it again!

when it came time to saute the garlic and onion, i also added fresh broccoli flourets, sliced zuccini and sliced baby carrots. it was delicious with the added veggies!

This is good for my kids, but I would not make it for company.

delicious - but for those not understanding the broth concept...the key is to cook the pasta in the water until slightly tender but still FIRM, drain it and return it to the pot, add the broth and continue cooking it so as to absorb almost all of the chicken stock, infusing it into the pasta (leaving just a bit of liquid) - then toss the sauce over, top with cheese - you'll be surprised with this result. I also add 1/4 cup broth to the meat mixture just to moisten slightly...

This was great, and I loved the idea that there was no thick gloppy sauce so it was naturally lower in fat, but I had to make some modifications for our own personal taste! I don't see the reason for the chicken broth in this recipe unless it actually coats the pasta. I increased the chicken broth to 2 cups, and added 2 tsp of cornstarch to the broth and simmered it in a small saucepan on the stove before tossing it with the linguine. I also increased the crushed red pepper by 1/2 tsp. I agree fresh herbs would have been better, but the dried worked well too! Always looking for new and interesting ways to use Light Kielbasa, so this will be a repeater!

Quick and simple. It has a nice kick to it. I'd be interested to see what the addition of tomatoes as suggested by the others would do. It's a nice and different middle-of-the-week dinner.

I don't understand the role of the chicken broth in this dish. Everything looked great until I added the chicken broth. If I made this again, I'd skip the broth and probably add some tomatoes.

This is one of my most sought after receipes. I cut back on the crushed red peppers for the kids. I like chopped tomatoes in this. Fresh herbs are much better but the dried ones do well in a pinch.

I have been making this recipe since getting the issue back in 1995. It has been one of my husbands favorites ever since!

Wonderful if you like spicy food. I make it all the time. A family favorite.

The dish was missing a sauce - I will be making it again but doing something about the lack of sauce... and there was too much linguine for the amount of sausage... I think it is a good basis for a much better recipe with the addition of a sauce.

A word to the wise. Using powdered cayenne instead of crushed red pepper was a good substitution, but I recommend only using 1/4 tsp. or you might knock yourself out of the water with spicyness.

Sorry...I was not impressed at all. Using dried herbs is a bad choice since there really isn't a sauce that would help to soften them. Definitely use fresh if you decide to try this recipe.

This dish was quick and easy to prepare. It tasted good, but I think I would make it more spicy the next time.

I received rave revues with this dish. I added 1/4 c white wine to deglaze my skillet prior to returning the sausage and added a little garlic butter to the linguine after tossing it in the chicken stock. Have already passed the recipe on to my kids because it was so easy to fix.

Very good and easy to prepare. I did use a little red wine to deglaze the pan before adding the sausage to the onion/spice mixture. Served with a seminola bread and Chilean Caubernet Savignon. Excellent
