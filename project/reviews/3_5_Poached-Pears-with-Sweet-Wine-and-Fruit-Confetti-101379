There were several problems for me with this recipe. I used a white Moscato wine, and thus the pears turned brown since the recipe did not mention putting the pears in water with lemon juice before cooking them. I would also recommend halving the pears and removing the stem and all the core as well. This will also help the pears cook evenly all the way through. Many of my pears were cooked on the outside, but the middles were still raw. Finally, the sauce took longer to cook and thicken, closer to 20 minutes. I used cornstarch as a thickener. Otherwise, we loved the taste and would try this again but with better cooking methods.

This was a stellar finale to a wonderful meal. I used mango instead of cantaloupe, which gave the confetti a wonderful tang. I did use Moscato wine, but any sweet wine would be fine, and reduced the liquid to a thicker consistency (e.g. thin caramel sauce). Presentation is everything - one guest literally squealed with delight when she realized the intact pear was hollowed out. Hubby later suggested I fill the cavity with mousse or whipped cream for 'next time' - and yes, there will be a next time! This was an amazing dish, and easy to make ahead.

When all is said and done, these pears could just have well been poached in a sugar syrup. The flavors of the ingredients were lost completely. Surrounding the pears with the fruit "confetti" was pretty, but the recipe isnt worth it. Its just sweet.

This was a wonderful dessert, I served it after brunch. It's very sweet! Also I used cornstarch instead of arrowroot- 2 1/4 tsp.

Good healthy dessert recipe. I bought Bosc pears and they took forever to cook. Maybe they weren't ripe enough. I used a Sauterne wine and would like to try the Moscato but didn't find any this time. One problem, for 6 serving you have to buy large quantities of the cantaloupe and strawberries but then who doesn't like fruit.

This was an easy and beautiful dish to make - a great alternative to my usual baked apples. Yum!

This was a delicious, impressive and excellent compliment to my usual baked items. I suggest preparing this a day ahead. Keep in mind that 3 1/2 cups of wine is about 1 bottle, just in case you double the recipe. Enjoy!!!!!
