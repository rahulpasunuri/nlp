This is a keeper! We used ribeye steaks instead because that was what we had on hand. I added extra beef broth since my reduction left me with no sauce (user error). Also didn't have parsley on hand for the cheese. Can't say that it was missing. Yummy!

This is obviously an indulgent recipe, but it really delivers. I was a little weary of the cooking method, but my filet was amazing. Nice crust on the outside, beautiful med-rare in the middle. The sauce is fantastic and the blue cheese topping really puts this in the orgasmic category for me. Rave reviews from everyone, this is awesome!

Very good recipe but take it easy on the blue cheese, it can be a bit rich. I am going to try it with goat cheese next time as I think that would be good too. Panko is a must to make it nice and crispy.

This is an amazing recipe. I have made it twice this week. I was skeptical about pan frying and broiling filet, but it melted in my mouth. I tried it tonight using sirloin (for my children) and it was pretty bad (luckily I made filets for the adults).

I skipped the panko/bleu cheese crust but made the sauce and steaks as directed. I think the only change I made was to skip adding the last tbs of butter to the sauce and forgetting to reboil it for two minutes after adding it to the pan drippings from the steak. Oh, and I used a really bad $5 red wine. Even so, the sauce was amazing! Absolutely delicious and pretty easy too. Next time I'll try to "healthify" it a bit by using olive oil instead of butter. I hope it works because I'd love to make this sauce a staple.

I made this dish for a couple of friends for a semi- formal dinner. AMAZING...... I thought it was easy to make and exceptional in flavor.

Not impressed at all. Against my better judgement (due to the reviews) I followed the receipe to a tee. All filets should be grilled. Sceond of all, a good filet does not need all this crap on it

The hundreds of reviews are a reflection of how SUPERB this recipe is--it definitely won't disappoint; serve it to guests to impress.

A real show stopper. The fragrance alone will stop your guests in their tracks. I recommend using a garlic press (everyone should have one of these) as I prefer fresh garlic.

I just the sauce from this recipe and used it over simply grilled steaks. The sauce did not impress on its own -- I think it needs the counterpoint of the blue cheese crust to work. I wouldn't recommend it alone.

This recipe is AWESOME. I am from Minnesota and have had the original as well. Very tasty. I do believe they grill on applewood and charcoal as well, though, which may add some more flavor to the steak.

I thought this was wonderful -- can't decide if I like it more or less than the beef medallions with cranberry-port sauce and gorgonzola, also on this site. Both are wonderful, but I have to say the cranberry flavor in the other recipe was a wonderful complement to the bleu cheese. Anyway, both are delicious. Highly recommended.

I had to cater for some meat eaters and vegetarians ... so for the veggies, I substituted huge Portabella mushrooms for the steak and used the topping and sauce as per recipe. Followed others' advice and grilled (broiled) the steaks, turned out perfect served with sides of garlic mashed potatoes and steamed spinach. Rave reviews from everyone!!

Super yummy! Would absolutely recommend for any occasion. I actually made it for myself while hubby was out of town. Paired it with truffled mashed potatoes (white truffle oil, sold at Trader Joes, don't spend the $$$ at the supermarket unless you have to, sour cream and butter) and a fabulous red wine from the Paso Robles region in Central California...wonderfully decadent. Can't wait to try it on others.

Wonderful for a special candlelight dinner with good friends. We seared the steaks first and finished in a 250 degree oven as recommended by other reviewers.

Loved this!!! Made it exactly to the recipe, and wouldn't change a thing! We loved that it was a little different than the standared "red wine sauce" that usually accompanies steak, and so I definitely would not strain the sauce before serving. Chopped the shallots and garlic very fine and it went perfectly with the "lumpy" blue cheese crust on the steak. The blue cheese added just the right contrast without being overwhelming. Was not difficult at all to prepare; one of the easier dishes since both the blue cheese topping and the sauce can be pre-made and stored in the refrigerator. We served this with olive oil and garlic potatoes, and the two were excellent together. We scooped the sauce over the potatoes and scraped our plates! YUM!!!!!!!

Followed the recipe, just delicious!

Rating: 2
I followed every part of this recipe with diligence, including the exact brand of bleu cheese (Maytag) and used a quality dry red wine, etc. I think this recipe has incredible potential... BUT... I doubled the sauce volume (as others had suggested) yet otherwise decided to follow the recipe EXACTLY. I did NOT strain -- I wish I had. The problem is this... the shallots show this red sauce to be what it really is, purple (I think a more complimentary sauce to the steak would have been of a consomme nature, not a "lumpy" sauce). Less than attractive around your beautiful bloody-red filet mignon (for those of us that favor extremely rare steaks). The taste of the sauce is fantastic, but the visual is thumbs down (I'm big on presentation, so maybe this is unique to me). I might also question why the sauce required more butter added in the final stage... it had a wonderful flavor already, and didn't need the extra shot of fat. In fact, I think it introduced a greasy element that it didn't have before the addition of the butter. All in all, hard to fail when you're cooking a lovely filet mignon... so I can't help but be happy with my meal. But I don't think this recipe (as-is) warranted the expense or effort. That said, I will repeat this -- but the sauce will be strained. And I don't know that I'll double the volume of sauce -- there's such a thing as too much of a good thing. TWO FORKS only because I think this recipe requires serious adjustments. Has the potential to be a FOUR FORK steak... but what filet mignon doesn't?!! ;)

This is my new favorite indoor steak dish!! It was so tasty and incredibly easy to put together. I accidentally forgot to add the butter to the sauce at the end and we still loved it. The topping is very light, with just a hint of blue cheese, rather than a thick coating. Will make again & again!

Since my husband has just recently discovered that he absolutely loves blue cheese, I felt that I must give this recipe a try. I've now made it twice - once frying the steaks as the recipe states (which was very messy - little greasy splatterings everywhere!) and once broiling the steaks in the oven first. Both times the meal was fantastic! I'll experiment with grilling the steaks on the outdoor grill when the weather gets better. It's really the blue cheese and panko crust that makes the meal incredible regardless of how you cook the meat. I might even try making a topping like this on grilled burgers in the summer. This is very tasty and impressive meal that I will make again and again for both ourselves and for our meat-eating guests.

Made this on Valentine's Day for my husband. We both loved it! Suprisingly easy to make. Looked like it was ordered straight from a gourmet restaurant. Made with panko purchased from an asian store. It didn't say "panko" on the package - it had asian writing all over it that I could not read but the photo on the package showed a crispy breaded cutlet. It was cripsy and perfect. Can't imagine that it would be just as good with regular bread crumbs.

Oh this is heavenly. Made two changes. First, because my family isn't among the fotunate that eat filet on random thurdays, I used boneless ribeyes. Second, I didn't have panko on hand. Bon Appetit has said panko it the best substitute for fresh french bread crumbs, so I reversed this logic and allowed fresh french bread crumbs to stand in for panko. The meat was so tender I would have believed it was a filet if I hadn't purchased it myself. And the sauce cheese combination was spectacular!!!!

Maytag Blue cheese is a high-quality brand of domestic blue cheese that is readily available in many supermarkets or through mail order from Maytag Cheese Co. or even on the website http://www.cheesesupply.com/product_info.php/products_id/242 Good luck with it. You'll find it is among the best cheese around.

I'm not sure what Maytag blue cheese is. Will someone please clarify this for me? I made this recipe using plain blue cheese because I couldn't find Maytag. I thought it was very salty. I used low salt beef broth and Shiraz for the wine reduction. I suspect it was the kind of blue cheese I used. My husband loved it, though. He said it was elegant enough for guests. This is why I gave it 3 forks.

I thought this recipe was great, I'm always looking for new ways to use blue cheese, and Maytag is my favorite. The red wine sauce was great. Next time I make this I will use a less expensive steak, filet is a little pricey to cover up with a strong-flavored topping. If your grocer doesn't sell Panko, go to an Asian grocery store. The crunchiness of these crumbs is important to the texture.

The red wine sauce was amazing. I doubled it and it still wasn't enough. The blue cheese topping was bland, though. Although I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, I really don't think that was the problem. Next time I will increase the blue cheese. I really didn't like the frying of the steaks - next time I will just broil and add the topping at the last minute.

I was scared about the merlot reduction because it looked almost black after boiling, and I almost left it off. I'm glad I didn't; it was wonderful! Complimented the maytag-panko crust brilliantly.

We made this last night when we invited another couple over for dinner...amazing. We used a nice Zinfandel (Cline Zinfandel) fir the recipe which we also used for the Zinfandel glazed shallots that accompanied the steaks. We also included garlic mashed poted potatoes and pancetta green beans with the main course. One of our guests asked that we leave the blue cheese topping off since she's not a big fan of blue cheese. We did however include a small amount on he side for her which she quickly added to the top of her steak afetr trying. Even if you're not a blue cheese fan, you'll still like this!

This was very good, but under the guise of "what's on hand", I made a few mistakes that hopefully can be avoided in your kitchen. I used a Zin instead of a Cab, so the sauce was weak.

I used a cast iron pan, well heated in advance, olive oil to coat pan and did our steaks for 3.5 minutes each side and the 2 under the broiler. Came out perfectly medium, although I normally prefer med-rare. My sauce reduced much more quickly than the recipe states it should take and so I deglazed the cast iron skillet with some more wine and then added my reduced sauce. Comments such as "you've outdone yourself" were plentiful.

Excellent! Made it for Mother's Day and everyone enjoyed it. It was simple to make and the flavor was out of this world! Definitely will make it again for company.

Wowsers! An excellent recipe and I am not a blue cheese fan at all. But, I did enjoy these steaks and my guests were very impressed. Don't be put off by this recipe just because you don't like blue cheese - take a chance and you will be very pleasantly surprised!

I thought this was perfect. My low-carb friends were even willing to eat it despite the panko. I will make this again and again.

I made this dish as written, sans the Maytag Blue Cheese, which I couldn't find. We absolutely loved this dish and will be making it again in the future. We cooked the steaks for 6 minutes a side, which was a perfect medium. I think the Panko is key for that crunch, and I wouldn't substitute regular old breadcrumbs.

YES! Very good! Could not find Maytag Blue but used the Panko and a Danish blue and it was delicious. I am glad I knew what I was doing in the kitchen though.

Excellent! I would definitely pay for this in a restuarant. I used a cabernet shiraz and it turned out excellent; reduced the sauce a little too much but the overall taste was to die for!

Simply the best meal I've ever made. I too grilled the steaks first which added a nice flavor, and used an Australian Shiraz. I over reduced the sauce a little too much, but it was still amazing. I served with garlic steamed baby red potatoes and a pear-walnut-blue cheese salad which both complimented the filets perfectly. Even my very talkitive man was quiet at the table only letting out "MMM-HMM" and "oh yeah"s. All at the table raved and this will become a favorite to serve to my guest.

Great, easy and fast. I do recommend putting the sauce on the bottom rather than on top. The topping does get soggy. Super flavor and very tender. Will make this many more times.

Rating: 4
This came out delicious.. definitely a keeper. Basically followed the directions, except added more wine after the sauce had reduced to have a bit more liquid to pour around the steaks. Blue cheese+ rosemary+ filet mignon is a winner. Served with herbed mashed potatoes, sugar snap peas, and a shiraz-cabernet. Guests raved.

I didn't have panko, but I did find some cracker meal in the pantry, and it worked amazingly well. My guests were mental about it. Next time I think I'll increase the cheese. And use a REALLY stinky cheese.

Rating: 4
TO GOLDEN: The type of cheese (brand but more important quality) is VERY important and is possibly why you didn't enjoy the topping. Blue Cheese (or gorgozola as it is also called) is similar to Parmesan - you can get it processed and cheap but it tastes NOTHING like a good quality (and more expensive) variety... Try a wine and cheese shop or exclusive grocery next time.

EXCELLENT !!!

Rating: 2
I didn't much care for the cheese topping but I did really like the sauce and will definitely use that part of the recipe again. Maybe the topping too but perhaps only about half. And I would pour the sauce over the steaks and not around them as the recipe instructs. Our store didnt have the Maytag Blue Cheese and I used a brand by the name of Treasure Cave. I have never used Blue Cheese before for anything so don't know anything about brands and such...

Rating: 4
i have made this a few times, and in response to the last poster--i specifically over-reduce the sauce. the onions get really crispy and good, and the flavor is more concentrated. i really like it that way, so it's more like a topping of onions than a sauc-y topping. i'm going to make this for my mom for easter dinner because it's really simple.

Rating: 3
This is a superb addition to my filet mignon repertoire. I goofed when I was executing the sauce and reduced it too far while trying to do other things. I tried to correct by adding more wine and broth, but the steaks with the topping were pretty wonderful in spite of that! The panko is excellent in keeping the topping together without being too heavy and bready. The amount of cheese is a nice accent to the beef as is. I think more cheese would overpower the beef. A nice special dinner!

I served this dish to mark a special family occasion, with visiting relatives. They all loved it, and so did I. We also grilled the steaks, then finished them under the broiler with good results. I did not reduce the sauce enough, and although the flavor was good it was quite thin; I would spend more time reducing it next time. (I'm still learning). I took the advice of others and used Stilton. I used an Australian Shiraz (also previously recommended) by McWilliams which was LOVED by all; a great wine, and very reasonable. A very easy recipe other than my mistake during the reduction phase. This dish makes a great presentation!

This was absolutely amazing! Who would have ever thought a pan cooked filet mignon could taste so good! I've always looked for a good filet recipe for home and this is by far the best. Friends loved this dish. Was excellent with grilled asparagus and gorgonzola whipped potatoes. I tried doubling the topping the 2nd time and it was too overpowering. The recipe is just right. I couldn't find the panko so I used regular bread crumbs and it was fine. Delicious!

Made this for my husband last night. We both thought it was very good. I didn't have any beef stock, so I used some homemade chicken stock instead. This left the sauce with a rather unapealing color, but it tasted good. Definitely double the cheesy top and I think the steaks would be better on the grill.

We served this dish at a small dinner party and it was a hit. I would recommend doubling the amount of blue cheese crust. It was just delicious and everyone admitted that they would have liked more. We made it with grilled asparagus and gratin potatoes with tarragon and white cheddar (also on this site). The only thing we did differently is grill the steaks before broiling with the blue cheese crust.

To the "cook" from Pittsburgh, all I can say is what the heck are you talking about?? Is this review supposed to be about the recipe, or in reference to some obscure theatrical or written work that has nothing to do with this website? Please enlighten; I'm sure that I'm not the only one confused about this! By the way, I DID actually make this recipe and it was great. We had a good bottle of Australian Shiraz with it, which complemented the blue cheese (I used Stilton)flavour nicely.

Rather than engage in a point-by-point response to the textual interpretation of Jill from Exeter's pleas, I want to respond to the more general issue at hand. Let me preface my discussion by quickly reasserting a familiar theme of my previous letters: Jill maintains that unfounded attacks on character, loads of hyperbole, and fallacious information are the best way to make a point. This is hardly the case. Rather, there is growing evidence that says, to the contrary, that if I hear her gofers say, "Miss Jill's strictures enhance performance standards, productivity, and competitiveness" one more time, I'm certainly going to throw up. She is an opportunist. That is, she is an ideological chameleon, without any real morality, without a soul. Miss Exeter is differentiated from your average frightful, unbalanced liars and cheats by virtue of the fact that she wants to make individuals indifferent to the survival of their families. If Jill from Exeter's spokespeople are frightened that she might propound ideas that are widely perceived as representing outright nonrepresentationalism before you know it, they have only themselves to blame. That is why, come what may, we must lend support to the thesis that the long-term consequences of her perceptions are rarely examined, let alone subjected to scientific scrutiny.

Wine - I used a Cabernet and it was great. We just broiled the cheese on top of the steaks b/c we are on Atkins. But Panko can usually be found in the seafood section of your grocery store or the asian section. I've had more luck in the seafood section. Great recipe and a simple reduction - loved it.

Delicious! We grilled a huge, Fred Flintstone-size sirloin and then covered it with the panko/cheese mixture. I will make more sauce next time by doubling the amount of liquid while using the same amount of garlic and shallots. Maybe I reduced it too much, but my sauce didn't have enough liquid.

I made this for Valentine's Day and had guests over. They absolutely loved it. I had a hard time getting the blue cheese and panko bread crumbs to stick on top of the steak. But, I just scooped it on top after I took it out of the oven. My steaks were also more like 2 inches thick, but cooked them the same amount of time (for medium rare) and they came out perfect (maybe more rare).

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he is still raving about it. He absolutely loved it and so did I. I used dried Thyme instead of fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I would highly recommend this recipe

This was simply outstanding! I savored every bite, and I'm not even a big red meat eater! I made it with gorgonzola and a Shiraz, which is very dry and smooth. I also used saucer-size top round steaks, which are MUCH cheaper and almost as tasty as tenderloin. Be careful not to cook them too long in the skillet though. Top round is a bit tougher meat than tenderloin, so 5-7 minutes on each side is really enough for "medium" steak eaters.

My husband loved this recipe and ate every bite. I liked it, but ended up scraping off most of the topping as it was very strongly flavored. Maybe I'm just not into blue cheese. The wine sauce was good as well, though I added some balsamic reduction to thicken it and sweeten it up just a bit. It was easy to prepare which is always a plus.

Based on all the great reviews, I was excited to try this dish. However, I was disappointed. The crust was good, but the sauce wasn't. Maybe because I used a Merlot. My sauce separated and I did not like the texture the herbs gave it. I should have strained the sauce. Will not make again.

Incredible!!! I am picky and my husband doesnt like anything fancy. I told my husband I was making this dish and he complained "why would anyone ruin a perfectly good filet mingon with blue cheese?". I made 3 steaks, 2 crusted and 1 plain. He loved it ! Then wouldnt eat the 1 steak leftover the plain one, he had me add the blue cheese crust before he would eat it. The next night we went to a banquet and they served filet mingon... he whispered to me that it isnt nearly as good as mine ;-)

A most excellent recipe...very easy to make and quite delicious. My butcher didn't cut the filets to 1 inch, so I just cooked them a bit longer, but otherwise this is the best filet mignon I've ever cooked OFF the grill. Make a good amount of sauce - this was tasty too!

These steaks were EXCELLENT; according to my husband the best steaks we've ever made. The sauce was okay but nothing special, maybe I did something wrong. We will definitely make this again. Be careful cooking for 5 min. each side, if you like your steaks more toward the rare side, they will be overdone.

To the cook who had trouble deglazing... I was taught to always remove the pan from heat after deglazing, before you add the final amount of butter. That's what I did, and I had no trouble at all with it curdling. Other than that, the only thing I could think of was maybe you substituted margarine for the butter? That might also cause curdling, as well. Just a thought...

This was really good! Substituted Danish Blue-couldnt find maytag- and cut some butter into it as a previous reviewer recommended. Also subbed Sherry for red wine in the sauce. Everything tasted great, but sauce looked curdled after deglazing steak pan with it(any ideas about this?). Husband and I didn't mind since it still tasted good, but I wouldn't have wanted to serve that to company. Would make again, but i think i would not deglaze with the sauce - it tasted very good on its own and looked a whole lot more appealing. Also agree with other reviewer - sauce recipe serves 2 - definately need to double if serving for four.

Use the best black angus filet and maytag blue plus don't skimp on the wine.The sauce actually came out better the second time. It must be because I used a different wine. It was a real jammy zin. WONDERFUL!!

Based on the high ratings, I was anxious to make this. Sorry, but I have to disagree with the majority of other reviewers.

I almost bought Stella, because of the expense, but when I tried the Maytag, I discovered the difference! I did the recipe as called for, but only used 2 filets.

This was fabulous! I did pay $40/pound for Lobel's aged filets, but I think the recipe would be great with any tender meat. The only change I would make is to grate the shallots for the sauce to make it smoother, and more elegant.

This dish comes together very well, and the addition of panko adds a nice textural touch to ingredients that naturally compliment each other. If it is difficult to find Maytag blue (as it is here), you may substitute Danish blue, but I would cut with unsalted butter as this variety is quite sharp. The sauce was delicious- I was concerned by the amount of garlic, however, the "green" smell dissipates during reduction. I recommend tying the sprigs of thyme together, like a bouquet garni, and then removing it and the chopped garlic altogether when finishing the sauce- it makes for a more "finessed" presentation. I made this recipe for two, and the amount of sauce was perfect. It all went together very nicely with a Califonia zinfandel. I served the filets with truffled mashed potatoes and a simple, clean endive and pear salad. Happy New Year!!

WOW! We also served this for Christmas dinner and it was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.

We had this for Christmas dinner and it was spectacular! I doubled the sauce, had no trouble with it being thick enough. An earlier comment reminded me that the meat would continue cooking once out of the pan and I found that 4 minutes per side for a 2 inch filet gave us a beautiful medium rare piece of meat. I watched the broiler closely because Panko and cheese brown quickly. This is the easiest and most delicious way to serve tenderloin I have run across.

To the cook that asked about the panko vs. fresh bread crumbs. The answer is technically yes but you will in no way have the same crunchy crispness as you would with the panko. It is the panko trademark! That is what is so great about that stuff. Most supermarkets carry it now since it is growing in use and popularity.

Due to the price of filets, I used New Yorks ($14.59 vs. $6.99 per pound), cut them in half and trimmed them well. FABULOUS! I also used dried herbs this time and was as good as when I made it with fresh. DEFINITELY double the sauce (great on mashed potatoes) and puddle it on the plate. If you pass it instead and pour over the top of the crusted steak, it softens the crust. ENJOY!
