This recipe has great flavors. The warm onions on the dressed spinach and endive salad really went great together. I can't wait to make this again.

This sounded wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, but the onions turned out soggy, mushy, limp. It was too oily. Nice flavors, nice idea, but either I prepared it wrong or this need major modification.

This salad tasted okay but the onions were so soggy with oil and with their own juices. That made the endive and the rest of the salad too oily. It's gloppy consistency overwhelmed the crisp salad vegetables. I might try it again, but with MUCH less oil.

We loved this recipe & I sent it around to 3 other cooks. I had to double the olive oil and lemon for the dressing--even for 2 people and half of the salad greens it wasn't enough dressing with the original recipe. I served it with grilled pork chops, all on the same plate--yum!

This is really good! I found that for the amount of onions you really need 2x the amount of marinade and at least 1 1/2 x the amount of dressing. But it's really yummy!

I really enjoyed the mixture of the sweet onions and the tangy spinach/endive salad. It was easy to do and a nice change of pace...didn't change or add anything.

Loved the sound of this when the Nov issue of Gourmet arrived; finally made it, and it was nice, but seems to need a couple small modifications. First, the red onions sort of bled their color while roasting, turning an unappetizing gray color (maybe not all red onions are alike?); I'd leave them out or roast them separately another time. Also, my own personal preference would be to add the honey to the dressing, rather than to the roasting onions (they are already sweet enough; but the dressing is a bit tart) Had some leftover onions and used them again on a spinach salad with eggs, gorgonzola, and nuts, and it was a great addition. Maybe I like the warm onion topping idea better than the particulars of the salad in this recipe.
