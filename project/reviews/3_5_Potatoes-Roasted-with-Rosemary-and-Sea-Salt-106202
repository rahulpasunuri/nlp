I liked this recipe a lot! I used little golfball sized red skinned potatoes. I added italian dried herbs to the pre-cooking seasoning. I cooked them for 15 mins, turned them and cooked for another 10 mins. I then added the minced garlic and a 5" sprig of rosemary (to be discarded after cooking). I cooked it an additional 10 minutes. The garlic very crispy. ALMOST burnt, but still tasted good. I garnished with scallion and parmesan. All and all yummy and easy snack that can be cooked in the toaster oven. Next time I would chop, not mince the garlic or put it in the oven for 8 mins, not 10.

This recipe is delicious, of course! A classic that is so easy. I like to make extra potatoes to have with eggs the next day for breakfast. The oil is the key to crispy, amazing potatoes. Rosemary is the perfect herb. Yum yum YUM!

This is not a very good recipe for this classic dish. Because it was different we followed it to the letter. First, why would anyone chop garlic and rosemary and leave them overnite. The glory of home cooking versus prepared food is the freshness of the ingredients. This seems like bad advice and unnecessary because chopping this quantity of ingredients takes less than a minute anyway. My second problem with this recipe is that the small amount of rosemary cannot possibly contend with the amount of garlic. You need three sprigs of rosemary, and just strip the leaves off the stem, no need to chop them. Finally, the potato surfaces should be dried after the potatoes are cut up. Just dab with a paper towel so they are dry and can brown properly and the potatoes should be placed in the pan cut side down. All in all this is a very sophomoric version of an old time standby recipe. It is a wonderful dish if made properly, not the way this recipe advises.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is one of my boyfriend's favorites! I double the Rosemary quantity and I spread fresh Thyme over the potatoes when they are finished roasting. I think it adds a nice touch of freshness to the recipe!

Good, but nothing special. It's pretty hard to mess up roasted potatoes with garlic; 99% of recipes will be just fine if done right. These definitely hit the spot, although I couldn't taste the rosemary, so I'll up the amount on that next time. They are a more healthful, yet not nearly as memorable alternative to "Roasted New Potatoes With Garlic" on foodtv.com. I'm sure it's the butter :) Either way, these are easy and good and I'll make them again.

These were delicious and easy to do for a brunch. I actually partially roasted them through the first step and popped them back into the oven with the rosemary before guests were arriving.

Very simple and very delicious! I did leave out the garlic as we were having it in a few other dishes and I didn't want garlic overkill (if there is there such a thing??!). My three year old loved them and kept calling them 'fries'. Worked for me! Went very well with steak.

Rating: 3
This dish is wonderfully EASY... but to enhance the flavor of the garlic, the day before add the peeled garlic cloves to the oil you will be using. By soaking the garlic in the oil, the garlic flavor is infused throughout. I prefer adding fresh rosemary just before cooking though. It keeps the rosemary flavor sharper and fresher that way.

I have made these potatoes twice so far and they were a hit both times. My husband loved them for our Valentine's Day dinner, and our kids enjoyed them at a mid-week dinner. I love how crispy they are, and the flavors are great. Definitely will be added to our file of regular recipes.

I tripled this recipie for 4 people and had the right amount. I had to cook it for almost and hour to get the potatoes crisy, but they turned out really well. next time I think I'll cut the salt in half though.

I used red-skinned, yellow-fleshed potatoes; if you run across them, try them! Very nice flavor and texture. Also I boiled them 10 minutes before roasting (as suggested) and they crisped up nicely.

I've made this recipe twice and have loved it both times. The first time I made it as part of Christmas brunch, and the second was on Valentine's Day. I served it with filet mignon and creamed spinach. One of the best meals I've ever made. I like using large red potatoes because the wedges end up larger and look very pretty on the plate. Rather than add the garlic and rosemary after 20 minutes of roasting, I add them in right at the beginning. I had no problem with it burning.

This was great i made it super bowl sunday for my in-laws and they loved it. I would however cut back on the garlic by perhaps a clove. But it is a great little recipe!!

WOW! These potatoes were DELICIOUS! I left them in the oven longer than the recipe recommended, but they came out even better! (I added ten more minutes at the end to allow the potatoes more time to cook with the Rosemary and then broiled at the end to make the edges crisp.) This recipe was so easy and yummy, I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly -- I made it as a side dish for 8 people so I just estimated amount of garlic, oil, rosemary and salt. However, cooking time was a lot longer than 10 minutes -- more like 25-30. I used red potatoes diced and put them in a single layer on a baking sheet so I don't think the quadrupling should have changed cooking time this dramatically. (but I guess I could have misunderstood something). Anyway, the potatoes were delicious -- but just take care when timing the cooking.

The flavor of these potatos is great, and the ease probably constitutes a three fork. I used fresh rosemary and fleur de sel. They didn't get nice and crispy, however. I seem to be having difficulty in the crispy roasted potatos department...

This is great for entertaining. You can even make-ahead by putting all the ingredients together in a zip-loc storage bag and store it in the fridge. The flavor really infuses into the potatoes and it's all ready to pop into the oven during cocktails.

My husband and I do these often as our favorite potato side dish. However, we toss the potatoes in the olive oil/garlic/herb mixture and preheat our skillet in the oven at 425.

We thought these were delicious and we will certainly make them again. Another version that we absolutely love is "Tattooed Potatoes": pour 1/3 to 1/2 cup olive oil into a glass baking sheet, add salt and pepper and optional minced garlic; cut unpeeled red, white or small russet potatoes in half lengthwise; press a small rosemary sprig, small thyme sprig or Italian parsley leaves on to the cut side of the potato. Place cut side down in the pan. Bake until potatoes are browned, about 40 to 45 minutes (with a spatula, very gently move potatoes occasionally while cooking to avoid sticking). The cut side will brown beautifully and the herb will look like a stencil or a tattoo. They're delicious and very pretty.

Straight forward flavors that I enjoy. Next time I think I will only halve the potatoes (parboiling 10 mins. first so they turn out very crispy when baking) and mix them with oil and ingred. in a Ziploc bag (for less messy combining) before putting on baking sheet. No need to stir half way through the 20 mins. Delicious! KIMBER

Tasty. Not spectacular but hey it's a side dish. For the amount of time/prep it's worth it. As other reviewers noted, the garlic and rosemary didn't stick very well. I might add an extra splash of oil with the garlic and rosemary to see if that helps.

Excellent. A little Old Bay is nice as well in the mix. BTW, who get's a stomach ache from potatos? I mean really...

My wife and I really love this dish. We have made it at least four times in the past month and a half. I have found that a couple of good twists on the pepper mill is sufficient. I've also found that lengthening the first phase of baking to about 30 minutes before adding the garlic and rosemary really lets the potato wedges brown up nicely and even get a little crunchy around the edges. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this for a brunch and did not have to deal with left overs. Everyone loved it and it was easy to make. The brunch was for a group of senior citizens. I love roasted vegetables and will make this again and try adding peppers, corn on the cob, broccoli, asparagus, etc. to this recipe.

Making these again tonight. Husband loves these, while I think they're pretty okay. First time ran out of olive oil, so used vegetable oil. It had a better flavor, than olive (although not as healthful.) Used Alaea Sea Salt that I picked up in Hawaii. It adds a wonderful flavor and texture (medium coarse.) I've made these three times in the past month!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought this was a very easy side dish. I've made it several times since. Those who don't like pepper may want to cut the pepper in half or take it out completely--it's a lot for the small amount of potatoes used.

Good potatoes, but certainly not the best I've tried. Even with only 10 minutes in the oven, the garlic started to get too brown. They were easy to make, and the prep time was short, so I'd make them again if I was in a hurry. I used coarse kosher salt, too.

We have a similar recipe, but I think it's better. Don't use potato wedges, simply cut the potatoes in half, pleace them on a baking baking foil on a baking tray in the oven. Pour on olive oil, so that it runs off. drop a few Rosemary tips on the potato, pour on a teaspoon of coarse sea salt, then bake in a hot overn (200°C) for about 35 minutes. Now pour on melted butter and grated parmesan cheese, turn on the grill and grill till brown. Don't bother eating anything else, just take 10 half potatoes and stuff yourself. Bon Appetit.

These potatoes are very good indeed. Which is more than can be said for both reviewers on 3/15. Talk about looking for trouble where none exists! I think it was perfectly obvious to any normal person that Alabama was commenting good naturedly on her step-daughter's eating habits to indicate just how good this recipe is.

A family favorite! To make preparation a breeze and reduce amount of olive oil used, spray baking sheet with olive oil (I use my Misto filled with rosemary-flavored olive oil), arrange potato wedges on baking sheet; spray with olive oil and sprinkle with fresh-minced Rosemary---Yummy variations:add a few shakes of cajun seasoning (Old Bay Seasoning good too!) after (or in place of) the rosemary to add spice to the taste---and (or)add a few shakes of grated parmesan.

These are good, but there is a variation in one of Marcella Hazan's cookbooks that I think is even better. She says to boil the potatoes for about ten minutes or until barely tender, then drain and proceed as in this recipe. The result is a remarkably tender and creamy interior surrounded by a crisp exterior. I do it this way all the time, because I think the extra step is well worth it.
