This was great, I wouldn't change a thing but I do think you need to like grapefruit. But if you don't I can't imagine why you would try it in the first place?? Pretty stupid.

This was a lot of work, and at the end of the process, which used I don't know how many of my metal bowls, it was not more than so-so. I cannot figure out how this made the Gourmet cookbook. There are so many better recipes!

My best friend, who is a grapefruit fanatic, loved this pie! Also, people (like my Mom) who don't like grapefruit, liked it too. It's a easy, impressive, refershing summer dessert

Loved the meringue shell but family did not like the grapefruit so made again using lemon curd mixed with whipped cream as filling and more cream on top . Fantastic. Truly angelic
