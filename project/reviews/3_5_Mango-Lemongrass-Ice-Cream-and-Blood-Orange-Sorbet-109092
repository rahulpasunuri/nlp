This is a wonderful recipe. I used 2 tsp of lemongrass from a tube. Not great, but it is all they have in the boonies where I live. I also used mango pulp from an Indian grocery store as it has a rich sweetness to it. Works wonderfully.

Absolutely make these two recipes -- the mango-lemongrass ice cream is easy to make and the flavors are outstanding. It pairs beautifully with the orange sorbet. Definite keeper.

When something is underlined and in a different color, it's a link......duh......the LINK that says Blood Orange Sorbet has the recipe

This ice cream has a great base but the lemon grass flavor was over powered by the mango. It was tasty but the mango seemed to have an 'off' flavor.

Both the mango-lemongrass ice cream and the blood orange sorbet are terrific enough to stand on their own, but together they're a real knockout. My guests were blown away, and I'm sorry to say we had no leftovers. I hope previous "reviewers" who didn't even bother to try the recipes before posting reviews will not dissuade anyone from trying this great combo. The blood orange sorbet is easily found with the search tool.

You can't even make this recipe once because it's not complete. The ingredients sound exciting but I would like to see the complete recipes.

To the above reviewer..whenever the words (recipes, ingredients, etc) are in a different color and smaller font (blue on my screen), click on it and it will bring you to the recipe/helpful info on the site.....

don't know if I would make this dish you neglected to include how to make blood orange sorbet, I have never found this in gormet shops or in my local grocery stores.
