I made these with walnuts as I didn't have hazelnuts. They are very good. The one thing I didn't like about them was that when I went to take them off the cookie sheet, most of them broke into pieces and crumbs. Next time I think i'll try parchment paper. Also, they flattened out quite a bit once they were taken out of the oven. They taste great but i'm not sure i'd serve them to company because of the way they look.

These are like eating hazelnut clouds...delicious! I left them in the oven to completely dry out as the oven slowly cools...this ensures they remain crisp. Yummy.

Great - these cookies are terrific. Crisp, crunchy & nutty, but little fat & few calories. I'll make them again for sure.

Very nice if you're a big hazelnut fan, but i found the nutty taste a tad much. (i wanted something sweeter, i suppose.) but it's just what a meringue should be--light, airy, crisp but smooth. i would make this again, but not for myself.
