I haven't made this yet, but if I'm reading the recipe correctly, it says to line the pan with plastic wrap first before it's cooked in the oven. Won't the plastic melt?

This is great! I've been meaning to try a terrine or pate and this is easy technique and delicious. The second time I made it I added 3 puréed chicken livers and about a tablespoon of whole green peppercorns to the final meat mixture.

I have made this again this year for a holiday open house. I made the terrine in smaller pate pans so that the slices would be smaller. They were a huge hit!

Very nice. Easy to make, although need to plan ahead - but this makes it easier on the night of dinner party! Lovely taste, subtle, very nice with the red onion confit.

I made this for a special Christmas Eve dinner along with the goose. It was a major hit with everyone. I am going to make it again this year for an open house and slice it to serve with table water crackers

I don't understand why just one review?? This was GREAT!! Rave reviews on superbowl sunday and we are still enjoying. Mild, not a pate...but oh so subtle. Not difficult, not time consumming, just let everything sit the 24hrs. Epicurious, we need some 'New'receipes, Please!!oh yes, I added additional port to the onions and carmelized longer, Thank you.

We loved this dish! A very tasty and not too heavy starter. I added port to the confit and let it saute and caramelize longer than indicated in the recipe. Very good!
