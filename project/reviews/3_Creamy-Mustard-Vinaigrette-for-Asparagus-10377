Subbed greek yoghurt for the heavy cream and cut the vinegar in half and the oil by a third. The kids loved it!

This was OK but there are many other good (better) alternatives for dressing asparagus so would probably not make it again. The final product had a real "bite" and I spent entirely too much time trying to amend it - first added too much more sugar, then backed that off with the same stuff that gave the bite in the first place. Also I generally use a very flavorful Kalamata olive oil and I think its flavor was too assertive for this. Presented this with a dish of steamed white and green asparagus with a bit of grated romano. Again it was OK but too much work to get it right!

Ouch! I don't know if reducing the quantity of the vinegar/lemon juice or the mustard would help. This was sharp enough to cut the asparagus without a knife. It has possibilities but I will approach very cautiously next time.

I made the full recipe... then found out the asparagus had gone bad. I served it as a salad dressing to rave reviews from both husband and 8 year old. Quick, easy and delicious.

Half this recipe would be more than enough for a plateful of asparagus. Other than that, quite good. I used leftovers as a pungent salad dressing.
