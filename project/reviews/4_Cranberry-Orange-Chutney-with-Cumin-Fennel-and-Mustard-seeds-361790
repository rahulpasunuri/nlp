Wow! This is a flavorful and tasty recipe with just the right amount of kick. No more boring cranberry dishes at Thanksgiving.

So good! My changes were to use the whole serrano, seeds included, and to add some crushed red pepper flakes because I like heat. Also I couldn't find yellow mustard seeds so I stirred in a teaspoon of whole grain mustard while it was simmering. It was awesome! Spicy, sweet, and tangy all at the same time. If I make it again I'll only use one cup of sugar, it was a little too sweet.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. I used brown mustard seeds as that was all I could find. I also could not find unsweetened dried cranberries so I used sweetened and reduced sugar to a scant cup. I added a dash of ground cumin and a dash of ground yellow mustard (as well as the toasted seeds) to amp up the spices. Reduced liguids due to 12oz package of cranberries. I think I chopped/sliced the ingredients too fine - so I missed out on some of the texture. I was afraid of getting a mouthful of orange peel or ginger - should have trusted the recipe.

Followed the recipe with brown sugar and added red pepper flakes at the end. Love the texture and tanginess, but I think this chutney could benefit from more heat and more spice flavors. Seems to lack the depth I expect from chutney. Next time I would research some spice additions and double the serrano.

I, too, am only familiar with 12 oz bags of cranberries, so I adjusted tthe liquid to accomodate the cranberries and I reduced the sugar just a little as well. It was wonderful and I think my quest for the perfect cranberry chutney has finally come to a end.

Could someone tell me where you can buy a 1# bag of cranberries? They are all 12oz! I didn't realize it until I got home and ready to cook. You wouldn't think 4oz would make a difference, but it does. I'm still cooking it down,wish I would have cut back on the liquid. I agree that it is very sweet, it is very delicious! Nice blend of flavors.

This sauce came out thick and beautiful, and will probably be super good on turkey, but it is cloyingly sweet. I followed the recipe exactly except for ground cumin and I used craisins dried cranberries, which I suppose may be the reason it's so sweet. I would start with 3/4 cup of sugar and add more if it needs it toward the end especially if the dried cranberries are sweet too.
