Cake had good flavor but, found the coarse cornmeal a bit tough to the tooth. I would do it again with a slightly less corn meal.

The first time I made the cake, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was pretty good. The next time, I added a fair amount of cinnamon to the batter, and cooked for 40 minutes instead of an hour. It was much moister and more delicious! The cinnamon added a nice depth; next time I'd like to experiment with a vanilla bean! Delicious served warm with homemade whipped cream.

The cake was OK - I had to revise the caramel by using more sugar and no water and heating the sugar in a large skillet - I probably will not make this cake again :-(

A lot of work & not a lot of payoff. If I were to do it again, I'd make two layers of caramel & pear since they didn't hold up to the dense, mealy cake.

This was very easy, and delicious! I love the polenta in the cake. I think with a stand mixer, there is no need to separate the eggs. I will definitely make this again and again. I do think that I will double the caramel when making it as a dessert, but leave as written as an amazing breakfast cake.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and it turned out quite dry, and not very tasty. I wouldn't make it again. Not worth the effort!

Delicious, a keeper! Only change I made was to add the zest of one medium lemon which really brought it up to another level.

This came out nicely. The cornmeal added a lot of texture that made it a little heartier - more like a coffee cake. I used raw sugar and it tasted great.

I made this cake but the caramel as described didn't came right. I tried again twice but the results were the same. The third time I ommited the butter for the caramel and came out fine. I increase the amount of sugar for the caramel to a half cup. Otherwise this was a very tasty cake.

I made this cake but the caramel as described Didn't came ut well. To begin with adding butter to caramelized sugar freezes fast and dosn't allow the caramel to spread. I skipped the butter and I mede it with plai caramel without the the butter and came out very good. I will increase the sugar for the caramel to half cup of sugar. Otherwise was a very tasty cake.

Made this cake for a dinner party and it urned out beautifully but if I were to make this again I would change a few things. The cake itself was lacking flavor so I'd increase the vanilla to 1 Tbl. I'd also add a third pear and slice them thicker to increase the fruit to cake ratio (there is only a very thin fruit layer as is). Also the caramel was a bit tricky to spread and I don't think it added enough flavor to make it worth the effort, a traditional butter and brown sugar would suffice.

it's the best pear upside cake that I've ever made, separating the yolk and the whites made a huge difference in the texture of the cake. A rel keeper.

I made this cake both ways, yummy. Second way was much faster but didn't taste quite as good, just wanted to see if it would taste good anyway. Use canned pear halves, one box mix pinapple upside down cake. Follow directions for cake and use canned pear halves sliced as shown and some of the pear syrup (from can) instead of water in the bottom of the pan for the recipe. Came out good but needed the addition of a little clove and some real vanilla extract in the batter. Real hit with the hint of clove in the package mix.

This is delicious. The cake is rich but light. The cornmeal adds a lovely taste. The caramelized pears are wonderful. The caramel works fine with the parchment paper. Use a deep dish for this, it rises. I used a souffle' dish. I am not sure all the steps are necessary (separating the eggs and beating the whites) but it is delicious.
