My Mom used to make this all the time. She always called it One-of-a-Kind Senagalese soup. I always loved it and we served it for company in the summer because it tastes great and has a fun name and pedigree. I made this as-is (maybe a tad more curry) and it's pretty close to what I remember. Thanks for this memory.

This was great! I'm a vegetarian, so I used water instead of the chicken stock. I also used celery rather than celery hearts as other recommended. And I used goat's milk yogurt in place of the cream. Very nice curry flavor, and came together very quickly. This will become a new standby.

Cheapness and ease are why I gave this soup a three fork rating. This recipe did exactly what I needed it to: it used up the remnants of my CSA box that were about to spoil, and it cost nothing since it consisted exclusively of ingredients I had on hand. I found both the taste and texture a little weird, not anything I'd serve to company. But it's perfectly edible for me, and it's reasonably hearty for a cold winter night.

delicious! I added ginger. and used yogurt instead of cream.

This soup is delicious. We added carrots and coconut milk as well. It went so quick that I made more

This soup gets points for creative use of ingredients. Half and half is plenty rich enough; I would not use the heavy cream. The extra cost of celery hearts is not worth it over regular celery stalks. I enjoy unique combinations of food and I love curry, but this soup wasn't doing it for me or any of my adventurous eating family. The best thing about it is how quick it is to prepare - start to finish in well under 30 mins.

Very flavorful! I had no celery so added a small carrot. Extra curry. I used 1/4 cp. plain yogurt and milk instead of cream, more than a cup.

Good - and very easy. Like others, I was surprised that it worked - and my extremely skeptical husband (a banana for what?!?!) enjoyed it, too. We used light evaporated milk instead of the cream.

This is a wonderful soup. We doubled the curry and skipped the chives (didn't have any on hand) but otherwise followed the recipe. We will make it again as a first course.

I thought this soup turned out wonderfully. It is a very interesting and unusual combination of flavors and was very filling

My friends who were coming over for dinner all seemed rather turned off when I told them what was in the soup - until they actually tried it! It is such a simple and easy soup and tastes so delicious - very comforting, a nice winter soup. Don't let the somewhat odd list of ingredients scare you away from this great recipe.

Never would have guessed that this combination would be so tasty. Only had 1/2 cup of cream, so added FF 1/2 & 1/2 for the difference. Served it warm! Delicious and filling.

I didn't have any cream so I used whole milk instead. Also used indian curry paste from the jar instead of curry powder. It is a really nice interesting combination of flavors.

When I first saw this recipe I was curious to see how it would taste with the unusal ingredients. And to my surprise it was wonderful

Have made this soup several times now and think it is fabulous. My favorite cream soup. Use half and half instead of heavy cream and it works just fine. Also like a bit more curry than the recipe calls for.

Originally found this recipe in the cookbook, The Best American Recipes 2002-2003,and am delighted to say that I agree with the choice!

Quick and easy to prepare. I substituted coconut milk for the cream and garnished with a little chopped cilantro. Very nice flavour combination with the curry and subtle sweetness of the fruit.

I was also attracted by the unusual ingredients. Found the soup very tasty and it was a big hit with the family. Definitely a keeper!

The unusual mix of ingredients caught my eye, and I am so glad I tried it! The kids love it and ask me to make it often. I use half and half instead of heavy cream to lighten it a little and will try it with buttermilk next time. It is good both hot and cold.

Unusual, slightly sweet flavor. A real pleasure.

DELICIOUS! Excellent hot or cold. Advice: use a peeler to remove strings from the celery. If you don't, little stringy bits will be left after you blend. Also, I used whipping cream instead of heavy cream. Just as tasty.

I was a little sceptical before making this (because of the odd combination of ingredients), but the flavour was really exceptional. However, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the heavy cream really isn't necessary. It was actually quite tasty before the cream even got added. Next time, I'd try the buttermilk suggestion.

This soup is great fun. It's quick and can be made with things I usually have on hand. Try making it with non-fat buttermilk. That was all I had available last time, and it came out rich, creamy, slightly tangy and low fat! This is also a good thing to make with kids, since it uses ingredients they know but gets them used to tasting something a little exotic.

Surprisingly tasty! Heavy cream makes it a bit too rich--half-and-half is just fine. This will become a weeknight standby in our household--and, it's fun to make for guests and have them guess what's in it!

This soup was easy and tasted OK, although the chives didn't complement it as well as I'd hoped. Also, that heavy cream made it extremely filling.
