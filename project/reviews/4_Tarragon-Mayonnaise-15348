Was missing a few ingredients (yogurt, capers and horseradish), but this mayo on top of the salmon burgers made it phenomenal!

We served this with grilled salmon. Excellent!

Very fresh and refreshing; makes more than enough for the accompanying salmon burgers - leftovers were great on salmon salad sandwiches.

This is a delicious dip for chilled artichoke. I didn't add the yogurt, but instead increased the mayonnaise to 1/4 Cup. This is good for up to 2 weeks in the fridge

Better accompaniment to fish than standard tartar sauce.

Less tarragon should be used. Its flavour becomes ovewhelming, even in small doses.

This mayonnaise is so flavorful that it would also be good on a steak sandwich, as it also goes well with fish and chicken. This is pretty much an all-purpose mayonnaise. I did substitue the yogurt for sour cream as I copycat from Iron Chef NY. I also added some chives in addition to the green onions. Excellent mayonnaise and/or tartar sauce.

Very very good. I use this rather than tartar sauce for any fish recipe.

Excellent, a favorite in my house. Try sour cream instead of yogurt.
