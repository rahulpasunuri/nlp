I loved using brie in a pizza. I made my own pizza dough and only spread a thin layer of Dijon over the crust. I would suggest that instead of cubing the cheese cutting it into thick slices, so it melts and covers the pizza more evenly. I also substituted fresh sage for the oregano. This recipie was absolutley delicious!

Delicious. I use the fresh pizza dough from Trader Joe's and whatever mustards I have in the fridge - usually a mix of Mendocino hot & sweet and some kind of grainy dijon. Also - whatever ingredient from the onion family I have: shallots, red onions, vidalias, scallions. Finally, I peel, seed and coarsely chop the tomatoes. In other words, I use the recipe as a guide and have tried many of my own versions... and it's totally foolproof! TRY IT!

I loved this! Took less than 30 min from start to finish. I used a foccacia dough which I already had in the fridge, rolled it out, and spread a thin layer of olive oil mixed with italian herbs before spreading on a thin layer of mustard. I followed the rest of the direcetions except substituted fresh sage for oregano and a Tbs garlic for onion and only used about 6 oz of brie which was plenty to please. My boyfriend loved it too!

My friend Tanya made this for a girl's weekend appetizer and it totally rocked!! Everyone loved it and begged for the recipe, which she sent today. She also used a boboli pizza crust. I'm going to add prosciutto and perhaps some sage as well. Try it you'll love it!

I thought this was too heavy - I like the idea of the flavors but will try pizza crust instead of the pie crust. Too rich.

Sensational recipe! I never thought of using mustard like this in a pizza, but it tastes great. I must say I was a bit afraid of using Dijon, so I used a milder mix with some seeds. Great all the same.

This pizza was great. I had no idea brie could melt so nicely and taste so good on pizza. We used whole wheat pizza dough which we stretched out into a crust. Used Gulden's Spicy Mustard.......the exact amount the recipe calls for. I imagine if you use too much the mustard could overwhelm the pizza but in our case it was perfect. Everything else was as directed. I blotted the tomatoes with paper towels to soak up some of the excess moisture. Delicious! And my husband loved it too.

Wow. Incredibly easy, really yummy and my got rave reviews. Like a little pizza tart. To address the "watery" comments, I removed the juice and seeds from the tomato and used wedges instead of rounds. Had no problem w/time and temperature. Came out nice and crispy on the edges and soft in the middle.

This was really delicious, but it came out of the oven a little bit watery. Next time I would up the temperature to 450, and experiment with different cheeses.

My husband liked this, but I thought the flavor was a bit odd. I attribute this to the Dijon mustard.

Was running short on time so I made this recipe using a Boboli crust. It was fantastic. The mild creaminess of the Brie and the bite of the Kalamata olives was a great combo.

This has a wonderful presentation and delicious as well for a light lunch. I used the pie crust as indicated but cooked it a few minutes alone first. I liked it alot and would not try the pizza dough.

This is a delicious and easy to make pizza, with unusual flavor combinations. The only part that's difficult is cutting up the brie--it's so soft, it sticks to the knife, your fingers, etc...I found that freezing the brie for a half hour before attempting to cut it helped a lot.

I loved this recipe, but replaced the crust with fresh pizza dough that is so ubiquitous these days.

I also used a frozen pizza crust (Pillsbury style) and brushed it with a little olive oil as another reviewer suggested and it was very tasty - the mustard base gives it a unique flavour I think and it's a very tasty mix of toppings.

I liked this recipe -- not hard to make and it was nice to have a mostly-made-at-home pizza. I used a 12" pizza crust from the grocery store and it was fine. I did brush it with a little olive oil before putting on the ingredients. At most this pizza serves two -- and I was serving three. Next time I am going to make two of them.

I also used a frozen pizza dough and baked it on a pizza stone. It was excellent, I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe was a huge hit Easter Sunday...it was gone within 10 minutes. I will try using a pizza crust next time as the pie crust didn't get as crisp as I would have liked.

Wonderful recipe! I used refrigerated pizza crust (Pillsbury or similar) instead of pie dough and pre-cooked the crust according to package directions. Then topped the pizza as per the receipe. Other than the crust substitution, I didn't change a thing. My husband and I both raved about it. Will definitely make again.

The pizza was bland and even though I cooked it longer than the receipe called for it did not set in the middle, making it impossible to pick up and eat. Would not make again.
