Eh, it was okay. The ginger taste wasn't very strong though, I think the ginger would have been better cut in a different way or in much greater amounts. This being the case, the dish was pretty bland and adding salt just made it taste funny. Was not good as leftovers either.

I served this sidedish with ORANGE BRAISED CHICKEN THIGHS WITH GREEN OLIVES and they were delicious with the cumin tying them together.

We just love this dish! It goes well with chicken or fish and every person I've served this to asks for the recipe!

I would have to say this recipe was uninspiring. It seems like an average side dish. After tasting it I decided it needed something atop it. So I made black beans in a garlic, soy, ginger, scallion sauce then poured them over the pilaf. Much better results. I will say this the recipe was super quick and easy. Though easy doesn't always translate as tastey.

This was not a lot of effort and a very nice side dish.

Good recipe for a weeknight side dish, but not remarkable enough to make again. We like starchier rice dishes and never have been much for rinsing rice beforehand.

I found this recipe to be very bland. It just tasted like rice. Too much effort for such a small reward. Try the "BASMATI RICE WITH SUGAR SNAP PEAS AND GREEN CHILES" recipe if you want a great rice side dish. Note: even though the above mentioned recipe has jalapeno peppers in it, they did not make the dish spicy hot. They just added a little something extra to the dish. It got rave reviews at a recent dinner party.

I thought this was only OK. For all the interesting ingredients in the recipe, I thought it turned out rather bland. While I didn't find it objectionable in any way, I don't think it's worth saving the recipe to make again.

I will let you know tomorrow. But in the meantime, select the recipie, copy it and paste into Word with unformatted text.

This is a simple, lovely, aromatic rice dish. I served it with chicken apple sausages and a nice sauvignon blanc for a perfect light dinner.

To the cook from Phoenix, Arizona: There is an icon directly above the name of the recipe that says "Printer Ready Recipe." If you click on that you won't get all the banner ads that appear on the recipe page. Hope this helps.

I'm not wild about ginger so next time I'd add toasted coriander (instead of the ginger) to the dish as well as the cumin and serve it as a side dish to Mexican food. I don't have nearly the desire to be the 'talk of the table' as High Plains cook from Wyoming/Idaho etc. and I'm sure jasmine rice would make a big difference. Just make sure it's ORGANIC.

Wonderfully simple recipe, would make any household cook the talk of the table. As a suggestion, try jasmine rice as I did (the second time). The aromatic appeal increases two fold.

Loved the recipe. However in "Print Version" I was not happy with having "The South Beach Diet Online" banner included in the print out!!
