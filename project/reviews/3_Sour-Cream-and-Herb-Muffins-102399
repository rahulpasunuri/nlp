I made these as mini muffins (15 minute baking time), for a wedding cocktail hour, and, well, they were vaporized! I used low-fat buttermilk/sour cream and forgot the butter, and they were still delicious. Very delicately flavored; most guests picked up on the lemon flavor before the herbs.

My partner and I LOVED these! I did not have a muffin pan so I treated them as biscuits and they were GREAT! I also didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried herbs instead, using only HALF the amt. They turned out PERFECT. They were fantastic with breakfast.

These were very disappointing. Very little flavor except for a very salty taste from the baking soda. Completely not worth the effort of doing all the chopping of the fresh herbs or the expense of purchasing them. I would not make this again. My family, which will eat almost anything, did not like them at all. The leftover ended up going out in the lawn for the birds.

I made these for a luncheon- people loved them, but I thought they were only okay. They were very dense and heavy. They had a strong dill taste, although I may have added too much.

These muffins were really very good. I made them with an egg, spinach and cheese dish and they were a perfect compliment. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used half the specified amount and used dried. I think it worked out well. We liked them very much.

Like was previously mentioned, I made these muffins for a baby shower meal. I made a grilled chicken ceaser salad and a three cheese spinach torte. These muffins were a perfect complement. They were best fresh and warm. I made them in mini muffin tins which stretched the recipes and seemed more appropriate for a group of ladies. However, I rated them thre forks becasue they were not amazing. PS I'd enjoy connecting with other cooks from Albuquerque.

Not the greatest and they stuck to the muffin cups. I couldn't find fresh basil or marjoram (and didn't want to use the dill) so I used dry. Maybe that was the problem. I'll give them another chance when I find or grow the fresh herbs

I served these at a baby shower with a main-dish type salad and they were very well liked. Best when warm.

I'd make this, but I can't find my § teaspoon.
