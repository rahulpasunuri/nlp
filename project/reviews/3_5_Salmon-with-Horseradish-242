o forks isn't really a rating btw "by A Cook". Try using salmon that doesn't come out of the $1 bin if you want flavor, not that farm raised stuff.

Nice simple recipe to up the natural flavor of salmon. Works even better if blackened and grilled in addition to the sauce.

This was a wonderful dinner for a weeknight. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the yogurt sauce on rice and asparagus as well. Will definitely make this again!

This is a great go-to dish during the week. I always use non-fat greek yogurt and generously salt and pepper the salmon. Next time, I think I'll increase the amount of chives.

Very little work produces a good meal with this recipe. Only changes I made were to use reduced fat sour cream in place of the yogurt and up the amount of horseradish. Will do that again.

Maybe I would make it again with fresh horseradish. It is ok. The sauce went well on a (cooled) baked potato. It just has an odd consistency and there are so many other great ways to have salmon. Try the salmon and dill chowder.

For being so simple, this dish is superb. The favor is outstanding. Will make this dish over and over again.

Fast easy - nice alternative to a heavy cream sauce and has a great tangy taste w/out being over powering.

This is a great, quick & easy recipe that I like to make for myself if it's a late night after the gym. I don't like plain yogurt, but I did use it in this recipe & enjoyed it very much.

Quick, easy and very tasty. The sauce isn't very spicy, so if you prefer a bolder taste use some more horseradish. However, this is a great dish and full of subtlety.

This was so quick, easy and very yummy. It got a rave review from my husband who thought he did not like horseradish. Since the unflavored yogurt here is a bit on the runny side, I substituted creme fraise instead. Sour cream would be another good sub. I also broil the salmon instead of baking it. Just placed the rack 1/2 way down in the oven. Then broiled the fish between 10-12minutes. Perfect. I look forward to making this again.

Simple and delicious. Have made it twice, the first time with sour cream, second time with yogurt. Both were equally yummy. I like the idea of using dill, sounds good.

Excellent recipe. Simple, yet looks so elegant when prepared. Even the non-fish eaters loved this one. It definitely has gone into the rgular rotation.

This was delicious and so easy! I substituted dill for chives and I think that enhanced the flavor for me. Will definitely make this again.

I made this dish with Fat-Free Yogurt, and I wasn't too impressed with it. If I make it again, I might try low-fat or maybe try sour cream. There are definitely better, low fat salmon recipes out there.

This is definitely a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Simple, yet elegant enough to serve to guests and most importantly delicious! Enjoy it!

I first made this recipe a month ago and made it 4 more times. I love salmon and horseradish and always have plain yogurt in the house. The prep time is minimal and the flavor is great. The only thing I differently was to add a small amount of dill spice mixture. Be sure to drain the horseradish well. I didn't once and the "cream" was soupy.

I used fat free sour cream instead of yogurt and it was excellent. I would not cook it in the oven again however, it is much better on the grill. The Horseradish cream was great over baked potatoes too.

This recipe took me about 5 minutes in prep time, and it tastes fantastic! This is a great recipe for people just cooking for themselves, because you don't have to bake a pound of salmon to make this recipe work. Make sure to grate the horseradish very finely - I got lazy and larger pieces of horseradish obviously make the cream a bit harsher.

I've made this 3 times in 3 weeks, though once I used thinly sliced sirloin instead of salmon -- also excellent. I put asparagus in the baking dish 10 minutes before the salmon is done for a one-dish meal. The selling points of this recipe are the ease and quickness. And it seams relatively healthy.

I am a younger and more inexperienced cook and I love this recipe because while it tastes awesome, it's rather hard to mess it up. I go easy on the chives (a personal preference) and it still tastes great. I've tried it with salmon fillets and salmon steaks, but fillets definitely work best. Goes well with mashed potatoes and I think rosemary potatoes work well too.

My husband, not such the fish fan, loved this - it was so quick and easy, and with extra horseradish it had the right zing.

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe and I thought a good alternative to the usual dill sauce. I had to cook the fish a bit longer than it called for, but other than that it was tasty and easy to prepare.

I didn't care that much for the combination of flavors. I think I'd like it better with a different fish. I confess to having made a somewhat funky substitution - low fat lime yogurt for plain. I liked the sauce well enough and it was blessedly easy, but there's too many recipes out there to try to bother with this one again.

This dish was delicious and so easy! I didn't really measure out the horseradish or chives, I just added and tasted until it seemed right. We really enjoyed this dish and wouldn't hesitate to make it again. Great weeknight dish!

Very good,very simple. I go with the opinion the sauce does better with additional horseradish. I also used salmon fillets instead of steaks and the results were just as good I'm sure. Chives are important to the overall flavor so make certain you use them. Great paired with roasted balsamic sesame asparagus and wild rice. Enjoy!

It was suprisingly yummy! Very easy to make. I found that I also had to add more horseradish to suit my taste. I did not have chives or green onions on hand so I added some dill instead.

This is an incredibly simple recipe. If I make it again, it would be a quick preparation, weeknight supper. I would not consider it a company dish. I used about twice as much horseradish as the recipe called for, since I like it. I would do the same again.

I love horseradish, so I paired this with the beet & beet green risotto with horseradish. The two made a great dinner! This was very easy, and the no-fuss oven time gave me a chance to make the risotto. Make sure you get low-fat yogurt rather than nonfat yogurt--the texture is off with the nonfat variety.

This was a wonderful, very easy, very fast recipe! And low-fat, too! I found it very tasty. I used it on arctic char instead of salmon (char is a similar, but lighter fish), and it was delicious.

Big hit! I loved this recipe because it was so easy to prepare! My husband and I both liked the recipe because it was delicious! Salmon with Horseradish Cream is a new favorite at our house!

I found the result of this recipe to be very disappointing: the initial ingredients were very flavorful, but the dish turned out to be rather bland.

Having not had salmon since childhood, I had forgotten what strong a flavor it is. It does go fairly well with the horseradish cream sauce, but I think next time instead of baking the fish, I'll sear it with crushed peppers and use the sauce on the side. The sauce is 'warm' enough that the soft, moistness of the meat from baking doesn't take the dish far enough.

Very easy to make. Horseradish is a great flavor with salmon--which I wouldn't expect.

This was super - I made it for a large group for a holiday dinner, and it was very well received. Both I and my sister have made it again. I put more of the sauce on each fillet, as the sauce cooked is superlative, and we all wanted more.
