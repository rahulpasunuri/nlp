I tried the recipe with the caramelized onions as one reader suggested. Added flavor but a weird slimy texture inside. I would make again, but just stick to the recipe as printed.

I had some fresh spinach to use up from the local organic farm. After reading reviews here, the only other change I made (besides using fresh spinach) was to add a carmelized onion and mix in all the mozzarella but topped with a little parmigiana. The entire family loved it. The kids also liked it cold the next day. (I'd recommend heating.)

Very good, surprisingly easy. It takes some time, but all very simple steps, nothing complicated. Like others, I added garlic, onions, and nutmeg as well as dried chili peppers, oregano and chopped arugula to the spinach. Mozz cheese inside and out, melted well. Extra spinach/ricotta mix was spread around rolls to bake. Lots of possibilities here: sausage, squash, sun dried tomatoes etc.

Based on other reviewers, I made some substitutions. To begin with, I made this as a pan of lasagna used no cook noddles. Added caramelized onions (4-5 thinly sliced vidalias, sauteed in olive oil over med. heat for about 30 min until deeply golden brown). Added some grated parm. and mozz. to the ricotta mixture. Also added a generous helping of freshly grated nutmeg and a little Herbe de Provence. Did layers of spinach, onion, cheese and sauce and topped with sauce, cheese and onion.(Basically followed the directions on the back of the Barilla pasta box) Bake at 375 for one hour. Uncovered for 10. rest for 15. HUGE hit! Very easy. The carmelized onions make it.

Just made these and loved them. I took the other reviewers' advice and added a medium sauteed onion to the spinach as iot cooked, as well as a few cloves of garlic and a healthy sprinkle of nutmeg. Rolled half of the mozzarella in with the rolls and used the other half on top. Used an entire large jar of marinara and it seemed to be the right amount. Baked it covered and then uncovered it for about 10 minutes at the end. The pinwheels looked great, were very tasty and crowd-friendly, and still delicious as leftovers.

Good basic recipe but not flavorful enough for my family's taste. I added sauteed garlic and shallot to the spinach and additional pecorino cheese to the spinach mixture.

I made this tonight! Delicious and easy to make. I did make some adjustments based on other reviews and what I had at home. Used whole wheat lasagne, added garlic when I sauteed the spinach, added a bit of nutmeg to the cheese mixture, and I used grated pecorino romano in the cheese mixture. I'd definitely make this again.

I didn't do the rolling with this dish, just layered it like a regular lasagna. I used Classico vodka pasta sauce for a change of pace. It went over very well with the DH!

Tasty and impressive. I made a sauce instead of store bought, added toasted pignoli, sauteed garlic and nutmeg to the spinach stuffing and split the mozzarella between the stuffing and the topping.

Great light make ahead meal. Use a meat sauce to make it a little more hardy. Easy and enjoyed by all.

I made this for dinner for my finicky elderly parents, and they both liked it a lot. It's tasty and easy to make, though I didn't see the point of sauteing the spinach first, so I skipped that part and hence the 1T of oil. I added about a half teaspoon, more or less, of granulated garlic, which gave it a nice kick. Also used an Italian four-cheese blend, which was a nice sub for mozzarella. Served with salads and Texas garlic toast.

This was excellent. I made it with a four cheese alfredo sauce instead of a red sauce. I also added in a little bit of garlic into the spinach as it cooked. Will definetly make this again!!

This was a hit at our house. Very easy. I did add garlic when I sauteed the spinach. I used to bags of fresh baby spinach, instead of frozen. Also, I mixed the mozarella into the filling and used a whole jar of sauce, as others recommended. When it was done it looked dry but didn't taste particularly dry.

The concept was great and the lasagne rolls were easy to serve. However, I agree the the recipe was missing something. I would try again experimenting with the filling ingredients and making a homemade sauce. Since the cheese did brown, I also would try putting it inside instead of on top of the rolls.

I am a huge fan of spinach, and usually try any recipe that contains it, this recipe, however, was perfect, even my son loved it, and its fun for children to help with rolling the noodles.

I like to cut the rolls into thirds after baking, then arrange the "rosettes" on sauce in a shallow soup bowl. Pretty and more elegant presentation!

I followed the recipe and it came out edible. But next time, I would add more seasoning, I felt it was sort of bland. I would only use parm. cheese inside and out and I would prob. make a homemade sauce.

I loved this recipe, I only made a couple of changes. I put the mozzarella in the filling instead of on top, and just put parmesan on top. I found that the mozzarella got hard and brown on top. I also added some chopped garlic when i sauteed the spinach. And most importantly, I made a homemade tomato sauce.

I made this according to the recipe except added chopped garlic to the spinach mixture. It needed more salt than I used, but otherwise it was a big hit as Easter dinner.

I am so thrilled to have this recipe back. After 4 years and 4 moves, I am ready to make this again. I suggest using 2 jars of prepared sauce. One jar for the recipe as it stands, and another jar of prepared alfredo sauce to pour over everything. Top with additional parm. cheese. Buon Apetito!

This is time consuming, but easy. And delicious! And an attractive and colorful dish. I added some italian sausage. Shrimp would be wonderful too!

This was great with a few modifications, which I made based in part on others' suggestions. I increased to 3 cups (1 large jar) of sauce. I lightly sauteed 1/2 chopped onion, 1 tsp chopped garlic, and a small grated zuccini, then added these to the ricotta mixture. I also used low-fat ricotta and reduced parmesan to 1/3 cup to reduce fat content. Also I did not cook the spinach and it came out great. Finally I used the lasagne noodles that come in thinner- and wider-than-standard sheets, and I just cut them after cooking to a 6" length (because longer seemed to me to be too much pasta). The dish came out terrific -- delicious flavor, light tasting but very satisfying (I ate 1 1/2 rolls, my husband ate 2).

What a great concept! I gave it 3 forks just for the idea alone. The recipe is easy & pretty basic, (I had it assembled in 45 minutes). Can't wait to try it with my favorite lasagna /ingredients recipes.

We made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and doubled the recipe to take a dish to the in-laws, and it was wonderfull! This is easy enough to make for a regular dinner but looks and tastes like you spent a lot of time with it!!

Liked this a lot, especially without the mess. A much better alternative to standard lasagna. Some things I would change: more red sauce, as I think it lacked moisture; also, more chopped veggies add to the flavor, like zucchini and carrots.

This dish was very easy to prepare, although somewhat time consuming. I added one large chicken breast (chopped) to the filling mixture. With the addition of the chicken, it made 15 lasagne rolls. The overall taste was a little bland. Next time I'll add some garlic to the recipe. This is a great dish to make for company since it can be made ahead.

This was a great and simple recipe. I added some crumbled firm tofu and my husband never even knew! The mixture needed some pepper, nutmeg, and some chopped onions. This is definately going to be a family staple.

I am just learning to cook and this was so easy! I added a little bit of garlic and shrimp to the filling and it was delicious. My husband says there's hope for my cooking yet!

I liked this because it was easy, tasty and didn't get messy when served like lasagne usually does.

This recipe has rapidly become a family and guest favorite. I now have to at least double the recipe when I make (everyone wants seconds) and I always hope there will be leftovers. It is easy to make, can be made ahead & tastes and looks great. What more can a host(ess) ask for? And it's wonderful to serve my vegetarian and meat loving friends alike. I highly recommend it!

I HAVE MADE THIS DISH MANY TIMES.I LIKE IT BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE IT WITH DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS. YOU CAN USE MEAT FILLING OR VEGETABLES. IT IS EASY TO MAKE AND TASTES GREAT.

My husband and daughters really enjoyed this dish. I liked it because it is so fast and easy and the results are delicious. My ten year old loved rolling the mixture up in the noodles. Fun, family friendly recipe...

I was looking for a do ahead recipe to serve at my daughters birthday party and I was glad I chose this one. Very good, just make sure you have extra sauce on hand because a lot will be absorded while it bakes. Will definetly make this one again.

This was a fast and easy recipe, the first time i made it i substituted the spinach with lump crab meat. Very delicious.

A wonderful dish! Not that different from lasagna, but better somehow. I substituted "yogurt cheese" (strained plain yogurt) for half the ricotta - worked great. I think this recipe depends on good sauce, so it's a great place to show off home canned/frozen pasta sauce.

This dish makes a very nice presentation. It is also an easy dish. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and it came out excellent! I will be adding this one to my recipe book.

Excellent and easy, too. It's also a super way to get kids (or adults) to eat spinach!!

added a little bit of garlic and used canneloni tubes.
