Love this recipe. I make it as-is and it always disappears. My kids love it too.

I made this for a backyard BBQ w/ the following exceptions. I substituted the oil for sesame oil. Would be great with toasted sesame oil as well. I also used shallots in place of onion as that is what I had in the fridge. Came out yummy! I even used the leftover marinade as a salad dressing.

This is a fabulous recipe for tri-tip! Let it marinate at least overnight and then BBQ ... one of the best ever!

I've been on Epicurious for many years, and I only make 3 1/2 star recipes for better. I've made 100's of recipes from this site, and I have never given a recipe fewer than 3 stars. I thought all the highly rated one were sure winners. Until now. This one... tastes like sour vinegared meat which remains tough despite prolonged marinade. This is the least palatable dish I have ever made, even dating to back before I knew how to cook. Taste the marinade before putting anything in there you might later want to eat!

I loved the marinade/sauce. I recommend using a different cut of beef. I used top round London broil and it was too tough even after I submersed it in the marinade for four hours while poking it repeatedly with a fork. If you insist on using such a tough cut of meat, maybe you could marinate it overnight in lemon juice and then add the other ingredients to the marinade four to six hours before you cook it.

Excellent. I used flank steak on a cast iron stovetop grill pan. Everyone in my family of 5 enjoyed this and made no changes to the recipe. I was able to cook the steak and sautee green beans in the time it took for the vinegared rict to cook.

Great for a gathering. Do ahead recipe and easy. Used sirloin for tenderness and marinated overnight. Was a big hit.

Made London Broil for the first time with this recipe and it rocks! Tons of flavor. No need to search for another recipe. Very satisfied. Even my kids loved it!

really great marinade. took the advise of another and put all in the food processor including the rind. marinated londen broil overnight, strained the marinade, heated and served with the meat. the vinegar gives it a nice kick. the mango salsa was just ok and didn't add much so will omit it next time.i might try with a more tender cut of meat next as i'm spoiled by filets and this was a bit too far on the other side of tender.

Absolutely delicious! This is a great and refreshing marinade that has very clean and simple flavors, that still have depth. Easy to throw together. I didn't have time this go-around, so I only marinated for 30 min. at room temperature. I also pricked the meat liberally with a fork to help with the flavor penetration, and it was absolutely fine. Next time, though, I will definitely be marinating overnight. Will most certainly be keeping this in my repertoire.

This was not a good receipe. My husband said it was disgusting and I have to agree. What we didn't eat we threw away. There was nothing memorable about this at all.

This was a great recipe. The meat came out tasty and I heated the reserved marinade and poured it over the top. So good with vinegared rice. One suggestion... Iinstead of chopping each of the ingredients I just juiced the lemons and threw all of the ingredients into a food processor. It came together really quickly.

This was the best grill-out I've ever tasted. Followed the directions exactly and for the reserved sauce - strained the rinds/bay leaves/etc - so just the sauce was left to spoon over the meat. Perfect balance and harmony of tastes. Next time I may try with a more tender cut than london broil. I took other reviewers' suggestions and served this with mango salsa and the vinegared rice - wow wow wow.

Excellent recipe. Flavors were spot on and leftovers were amazing. Served at a large BBQ and 6 steaks went without leftvers!

This recipe is just great. The prep is a little extensive, but once it is marinaded, it is quick and easy if you prepared it the night before. This will be heavily employed in my grilling rotation this summer!

LOVED IT! This recipie is fantastic. It's easy and delicious.

Fab-u-lous! Loved it, so did my husband! The lemon flavor with the beef was wonderful. I boiled down the reserved sauce with what was left from the marinade. Strained it, then used 1 T cornstarch to thicken (made a smooth mixture in a cup with cornstarch and some of the sauce, added it back in and simmered). AWESOME! Served on greens with sauce drizzled over, made a salsa of mango, pineapple, jalapeno, red onion, cilantro mint, oil & vinegar.

This. Is. Awesome. I can't stress it enough. I was under time constraints, so I marinaded the round steak at room temperature 15 minutes on each side, then broiled it 5-10 minutes at 350 degrees on each side, basting when I turned it. The flavor of the lemon really comes through here, thanks to the chopped rind, and the meat was so tender! Definitely a repeat - next time I'll be sure to make ahead for the overnight marinade. :)

Delicious, especially on top of a fresh salad. Love the soy-lemon flavor combination!

This recipe was delicious! I marinated a bottom round roast in all of the sauce. After marinating, I blended the sauce in a blender to make smooth as a previous person had mentioned and cooked over the stove to thicken slightly. VERY GOOD! Served with sauted spinach and crusty bread to soak up extra sauce.

This was delicious - loved by all, even my finicky 10 year old. I used some of the marinade for the cooking liquid for jasmine rice and it turned out delectable. One caveat: this dish is extremely salty... I was drinking water all night after eating it. Next time I would try low sodium soy sauce.

Very nice, made it last week "just for us" and making it again for a party. Last time forgot to reserve part of the marinade so just boiled the drained one for the sauce - worked perfectly well.

These steaks come off the grill flavorful with an unexpected lemon bite to them. Nice! Sliced the leftovers thin for sandwiches... can't wait to get home tonight and make one.

Have made this twice. The hardest part is waiting for the steak to marinate & to eat the meal. Yum!

I fully expected to adore this recipe, but while it was good, not good enough. I marinated overnight, seared, then finished off in oven. It was semi-tender, just not nearly as flavorful as i'd hoped. Also I found marinade to be a bit on the oily side, even though I halved the amount. I think i will try this marinade on chicken though.

Couldnt imagine the whole lemon/beef thing but this was surprisingly good! The sauce was even better on the cold meat the next day. Will definitely be making this again!

About the reserved sauce, you don't cook the sauce that's been set aside. If you marinate the meat overnight, just be sure keep the reserved sauce in the refrigerator too. Then pull it out an hour or so before serving so it is at room temperature by dinner time. Just serve the sauce alongside the steak. It's also great on top of steamed rice. While living overseas in Asia Pacific, a similar sauce of soy, lemon, vinegar and onions was served with just about everything and with almost every meal-- fish, chicken, egg rolls, pork, etc. They call it "finadene." The sauce/marinade is a standby concoction in the Pacific islands. This flank steak is a delicious recipe and is a variation of one of our other favorite Filipino dishes called Bistek Tagalog, which is soy and lemon marinated strips of top round which are stir fried and then served with garlic fried rice. Mmmm!

The marinade is divine. I used New York's and marineted overnight, then grilled over coals. Served this with Vinegared Rice (recipe on site - highly recommended, a perfect combo) and garlic green beans. Raves all around.

I made this yesterday for the very first time and loved it. The only change I made was blending the remaining sauce in the blender for smoother consistency. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I did everything a cook could possiby do to undermine this recipe. Not because I wanted to. Just because of Murphy's law. It is a wonderful change from my usual Asian marinad. The steak (after 6 hours) was fork tender. Hubby doesn't appreciate rare steak. Guess what--the left overs are gone. We have no idea how the sauce was over the steak. Final Murphy's Law. Poured the whole thing onto the steak.

This was great. I served it as a steak salad and strained the saved back marinate as a salad dressing. It is one of the best dressings I've ever had.

The marinade was really easy to make. I had no regular vinegar so used apple cider vinegar with no problem. We were also short on time, so barely made the six hours. Still yummy. The lemons were a great touch. We used a 1.8 lb flank steak which served 6 easily.

Very good marinade, and so easy to make. By the way, the sweet component comes from the coriander seeds. Excellent BBQ steak!!

Superb! I paired this with the BAY LEAF RICE PILAF and everyone raved about it. This will definitely be made again. The only thing better than the way it tasted was the smell it gave off when it hit the grill. My mouth is starting to water just thinking about it.

A QUESTION ! the description of this dish says "The interplay of salty, sweet, and sour is pure Filipino". I don't see any sweet. no sugar, doesn't ask for a sweet asian vinegar, etc... ANYBODY, ANYBODY? what makes the sweet? (i rated it 3 forks so as not to disturb the rating it previously had)

Very Good! Had six people in for dinner. They loved it.One of the guests was a retired chef who had her own restaurant in New York City for many years. She asked forthe marinade recipe. Made my day.

This meat is so tender and delicious, you don't even need the extra sauce to put on it (but I still used it because it just made it that much more delicious)!! Definitely making this for my next BBQ!

The sauce used for marinade was actually very good. I have been looking for a good barbecue sauce and this one I will use again. Thanks Mr. Lagua and thanks also to Mr. Ariola for sharing this with us.
