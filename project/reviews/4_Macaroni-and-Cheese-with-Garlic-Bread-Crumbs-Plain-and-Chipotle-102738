I was craving macaroni and cheese when I went looking for a recipe on Epicurious. I found this one and made it for a company potluck. Every bit was consumed and enjoyed at the party and it totally satisfied my craving. I made it exactly as directed. It is not low-cal, but that is the point! I loved it and will make again for a large group.

This is my favorite crowd pleaser. I love the bread crumb topping. I made both varieties (peppered and not) and loved both. I have already made this three times.

Delicious! Next time, we'll double the pepper and use it for the whole recipe instead of just half. The garlic and peppers make the dish!

Hands down the best mac n' cheese recipe. I make this often for big gatherings and it's always a crowd- pleaser. Yes, it's really rich and I've substituted lowfat for whole milk but never skimp on the cream or cheese and the garlic breadcrumbs are a must. We like spice and use 3 chipotles for the spicy batch. Make this recipe - you won't be disappointed.

This recipe was delicious, but I would use half of the bread crumbs in the future. The crumbs took away a lot of the moisture in the dish.

Super delicious - but very rich. I made it for a potluck party, and everyone loved it. I used a mix of white and yellow cheddar, and used 8 oz. of pepperjack just for kicks. I also added some red pepper flakes. It turned out awesome. It had just a little bit of a kick. I left out the chipotle, so I can't comment on that. Overall, awesome!

I just made this-followed the recipe to the t & it came out so delicious. Yes, there is heavy cream, lots of beautiful cheese, and it's decadent. I mean, this is macaroni and cheese people! Don't skimp out with the ingredients like some others reviews have suggested. No fat-free or light cheese allowed! Go for the good stuff! If you are looking for a Mac and cheese to satisfy your craving, this recipe is for you, trust, it's sooooo good. Creamy, with a little bite, and crunchy, butterey goodness on top. It's just like heaven. Sit back, relax, and enjoy! You deserve it!!

Love this recipe, but we have made a bunch of changes to make it healthier, and the quality seems unaffected. We double the chipotle, and I use a bit more flour to thicken it a bit more. We substitute the dairy for lower fat versions; skim milk, light cream, margarine. For the cheese, we use half regular cheddar and half of a 75% reduced fat cheddar. We add in 20 ounces of cut spinach, into the cheese sauce at the end.

After all the rave reviews, I was disappointed. I will admit that I used Panko crumbs...WAY too many crumbs and too crunchy...spoiled the dish...the half with Chipotle was very underwhelming...wish I had added more. I intend to keep searching for my favorite mac and cheese.

Yum yummy! I used 3 kinds of cheeses, chipotle, and little chuncks of ham. I split the recipe in half but still ended up eating it all week. I didn't mind since it saved well and was delicious!

I added prosciutto to change the recipe into a meat dish and it turned out great. Next time, I would add more garlic and spices to the bread crumbs since they were a little bland. I also like the idea of mixing different types of cheeses as others have recommended.

The chiles were a unique addition, and overall this was a tasty dish (we made both versions). However, we all agreed that it was a bit too rich for us.

Four of us finished every crumb of 1/2 the recipe - my husband, who does not like mac and cheese, went back for 3rds! We particularly liked the garlic in the topping. I made a few changes because I decided to make it at the last minute and didn't have everything called for: used 2 cups of 2% milk, 1/2 cup of cream, 1/2 pound cheddar, 1/4 pound colby jack, and 1/2 c. Parmesan for 1/2 the recipe. It still tasted nice and rich, and I saved some calories.

I altered this to make it MUCH lower in fat/ calories. Below is my lower fat version, still awesome! (I also cut it in 1/2 since its such a large recipe) For bread crumbs: 1 tablespoons unsalted reduced fat butter 1 tablespoons olive oil 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped 1 cups coarse fresh low fat whole wheat bread crumbs (dry bread slices and then process in food processor) For Macaroni: 2-3 tablespoons chopped chipotle chiles in adobo (these are SPICEY- use caution!) 1/4 stick unsalted reduced fat butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1.5 cups non fat milk 1 cup non-fat sour cream 1/2 tablespoon dry mustard 1/2 pound macaroni 1 pounds Trader Joes 75% reduced fat Cheddar, grated *corn starch if needed to thicken sauce Make bread crumbs: Heat butter and oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook garlic and bread crumbs, stirring, until crumbs are golden. Transfer to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Make macaroni: Preheat oven to 350° F. Chop chipotles. Melt butter in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan over moderate heat, then add flour and cook, whisking, 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, cream, and mustard and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 minutes. Cook macaroni in a 6- to 7-quart pot of boiling salted water until just tender. Drain in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. Stir in white sauce, cheese, chipotles, and salt to taste. Fill a 1 1/2-quart shallow casserole with half of macaroni mixture. Bake in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until bubbly.

Fantastic! We made this for a huge group of kids and adults and both versions were a hit. I skipped the garlic bread crumbs and just used plain bread crumbs, but it was still fantastic. This definitely did not feed the number of people indicated. It was gone within minutes!

This is crazy good. I use the $9 per pouan extra-sharp white cheddar and go for it! This is THE MacDaddy Mac & Cheese at my house. It's most requested for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It freezes beautifully in the throw-away pans for travel. Just give it plenty of time to thaw (it's dense) and make your bread crumb topping just before you bake it. I've also added caramelized shallots to the bread crumb topping - it's a meal with a salad and a green veggie.

This is a GREAT recipe, I know it looks very simple, but the taste is delicious. The chipotle chiles add a great flavor - don't skip it! I had a hard time getting the butter/flour mixture to be smooth in texture, it may take longer than 3 minutes to get a smooth blend. If it's still a little lumpy, don't put the cream in yet! I had to do it twice to get it right...

Great mac n cheese! I use a combo of reduced fat and reg milk, and half-n-half, for the sauce. I don't find it makes any difference for the taste, and it's certainly healthier and a bit lighter. I also sometimes use reduced fat Cheddar, but only when I easily find it. Adding some seasoning is a MUST, otherwise the whole thing is just too rich and bland. I add a tiny bit crushed garlic to the roux, season the sauce with little extra mustard, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. My English husband swears he's becoming American b/c he loves mac 'n cheese!

I haven't made this in 4 years and almost could not find the recipe! PANIC! Ahh! This was the first time I ever made M&C from scratch. I was worried it would be a lot of M&C and that the Spicy one would be too hot! BUT no no no! It was the HIT!! It sold out first then everyone started to dig into the plain. Everyone could not stop raving and people took some home and one person even took my printout recipe. I knew I would make it again but haven't been able to find this recipe! This is a DEF Save to Recipe Box!

I made this for a large gathering; used 3 pounds of pasta and doubled the sauce based on previous reviews. I felt the sauce needed some zip to counteract the richness so added extra mustard, plenty of ground ancho chili and a couple of good shakes of nutmeg. Used several kinds of cheeses. Made two pans plain and and two pans chipotle, both topped with panko crumbs. The chipotle was definitely the most popular and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. This was part of a barbecue dinner with plenty of sides, and we had 1 1/2 pans left (but that's OK!). Thanks to previous reviewers for suggestions. I will definitely make this again, but not too soon (very rich and calorific).

Beware of the chipotle peppers in adobo. They are supremely spicy and can overpower the dish

This recipe is a winner-- it has gotten rave reviews every time I've made it (including from a friend who worked as a professional chef). The plain version is good, but the chipotle version is the real stand-out. However, I like stuff spicy and even I can only tolerate about half the recommended quantity of chipotle & adobo (maybe the bodega near my house just stocks the extra potent stuff). The homemade breadcrumbs are what really make this-- I buy a fresh loaf of multigrain bread, pulse a few slices in the food processor and proceed as directed.

This is the recipe they used to execute lactose-intolerant heretics and witches in the Middle Ages. You could probably cut the cheese and white sauce volumes in half, and this would still be delicious. Two pounds of grated cheese is about 8- 10 cups. The volumes of cooked pasta, cheese, and white sauce all seemed to be about equal. We only used about half the cheese because it looked so ridiculous. It's a great dish, but it's WAY over the top. I was able to eat about a cup of the finished product. We sprinkled cooked & crumbled chorizo sausage on top (under the breadcrumbs) prior to baking. I don't think this affected my overall opinion of the dish however. The sausage was lost in the "dairy storm". Proceed with caution.

C'mon, look at the ingredients, no wonder this tastes delicious. This is a once in a while thing, simply because it is so ridiculously bad for you. I skipped the cream and used 5 cups milk. Next time I think it will be skim milk. The good thing about this recipe is you can probably make it a little bit healthier each time by cutting back on stuff and seeing if it works.

This is an amazing recipe, one that everyone loves. If it were up to me, the chipotle version is the only one I'd make, but for the sissies in my family, I make the plain. The garlic bread crumbs are a MUST, and the whole dish can be used for just about any occasion!! Love, Love, Love this one!!

Delicious. Followed the advice of other reviewers, and used a combo of cheddar, jack, and parmesan. Salted the macaroni while cooking, but only lightly, and didn't salt anything else, and yes, it was still borderline too salty because of the cheese. Used panko, which added a nice bit of crunch. The chipotle is so good - used one tablespoon in a halved recipe, which was a perfect amount of spice.

This was awesome. I used regular bread crumbs and cooked them in the oil/butter. I also maded the whole thing chipotle and only used about 1 pound of mild cheddar. Everyone raved and I have been asked to make this particular recipe twice since I made it a month and a half ago and I am making it again for a gathering of about 100 people this weekend. There were literally no leftovers. Fabulous.

I made it but changed a few things...the proportions for the sauce seemed off, so I used only 1/4 cup flour and whole milk only, no cream. I also used a mixture of cheddar, gruyere, fontina and a little parmigiano...sooooo good!!! Also to save time I used panko bread crumbs. It was fantastic. And I made the whole thing chipotle, everyone loved it.

Instead of regular bread crumbs I used panko and it was fantastic. Made this recipe on several occasions and people always ask for the recipe.

This was fantastic! I used the chipotle (3 T) in the whole lot so I can't comment on how the plain mac is. I used a combo of 2% milk and half and half...with all of that cheese you will not miss the fat. I was alarmed when I saw the quantity of cheese I was stirring in...but it is worth every last calorie. The combo of smokey/spicy chipotle with the buttery garlic breadcrumbs was insanely good. I won't make this often since I am not looking for a heart attack, but this is a great splurge to make every once in a great while.

I made this for the first time with the following changes: I made 1/2 the sauce, used only whole milk (no cream), and 1 lb of pasta and all the bread crumbs, and no chipotles. I also assembled everything the day before and added the crumbs and baked it the next day. It was EXCELLENT - the bread crumbs really made this dish. Everyone loved it.

I rarely give 4 forks but this deserves it!! It is so good and mine came out perfectly. I made half the bread crumbs and 1/4 of the mac 'n cheese for the 2 of us - still another meal leftover.

This is the perfect hungover food, salty and loads of carbs! I cut it in half and only made the chipotle version. I modified it a bit to try to make it a bit healthier using other folks suggestions -- used half whole wheat pasta and skim milk. I added some bacon pieces to make it unhealthy again. I wish I had made more breadcrumbs but now I know for next time.

This is the best mac n' cheese. I added a bit more chipotle than called for, but it's probably not necessary. I used half white and half orange cheddar. There are restaurants nearby that serve what they call the "world's best" mac n' cheese, but theirs isn't even in the same league as this.

Rating: 4
I have made this more times than I can count, always getting rave reviews. I only make the version w/o the chipotles when I have unadventurous eaters to cater to...I add a hefty amount to the whole pan when making it for myself. The only thing I would change is to vary your cheeses up a bit. Co-jack or pepper jack are a welcome substitute for some of the cheddar, and I've tried various others with much success. Sure, Vancouver, its just mac and cheese, but its a solid recipe (which some of us need/want) and the crumbs and chiles really make it stand out.

My husband really loved this and he considers himself a macaroni and cheese afficionado. I thought it was good. This definitely is a recipe where the quality and flavor of the cheese makes the recipe. Also, don't forget the salt because this recipe could be dull without it.

This makes A LOT; Very very good, though. I used 2% milk instread of cream and whole milk, and it turned out perfectly cheesy without being too rich. The chipotles are hot, so add a little at a time (you really want the flavor, not the heat). They can be found in the ethnic section of the grocery store in a small can.

Wow, this was excellent. I doubled this recipe, but used 2% milk and 1 pint of cream and added a little bit of smoked fontina and mozarella (because I didn't have enough cheddar). I used ziti and yellow cheddar. I made this for my daughters 1st birthday party and it was literally gone in about 5 minutes flat. I made two- one with chipoltes, one without. The chipolte version was a hit. I will definitely make this again- using chipoltes in the entire dish!

Wow. All these brilliant ideas. We're talking mac and cheese, for pete's sake, not rocket science. Make a bechamel, use milk, cream,who cares - flavour to taste, throw in whatever you like (its comfort food after all) and use whatever pasta you have in the cupboard. Didn't you guys take Home Ec in high school? Garlic crumbs were a nice touch.

I have made this several times, and always to rave reviews. I only make half of the amount of sauce and use half of the recommended amount of cheese.

I couldn't find chipotles this time, so I made the plain version, and while it could have used a little more zip, it was still delicious.

Wonderful! I made two changes...I used only skim milk instead of whole milk and cream. It was still wonderfully creamy! I also used much less than 2 lbs of cheese. I mixed all the cheeses I had in the fridge (havarti, pepper jack, blue and some mild cheddar-- party leftovers) and it was just over a pound. Still great cheese flavor. It was a huge hit with my kids and I'll make it again, knowing that I can reduce the fat and it's still yummy.

Finally, a mac n' cheese that actually has cheese flavor... of course, it depends on what kind of cheddar you use. I used Extra Sharp stuff from Trader Joe's. Once I had grated two pounds worth I thought that the recipe must have a typo! Dang that was a lot of cheese. But it mixes in just fine. I also have found that if you replace the heavy cream with European style plain yogurt, it has more twang. My guest were rolling their eyes up into their head with pleasure. Then they wanted to take a nap. True comfort food.

The bread crumb topping was a great addition to this dish. Eventhought i didnt make the mac and cheese by scratch or by the recipe, using 3 boxes Kraft Delexe Mac and Cheese kit works just as well. I had to add alittle extra cheese but it was great. The only thing was that the recipes gave me too much bread crumbs some if you do what i did, just use 1 cup of crumbs and u will be fine. Well definelty make it again.

I've made this dish several times and it's a winner as far as comfort food goes. I agree with the other reviewers...the chipotles and fresh bread crumbs are a definite must. I've made this dish with fresh bread crumbs, canned bread crumbs and crushed croutons. All I have to say is fresh is best and crushed herbed croutons work well in a pinch. Canned crumbs are so so...it just looks like you topped the dish with playground sand... I also doubled up on the dried mustard for more zing..

My new comfort food! The BEST I've eaten and made. I cut down the flour as advised, but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. The chipotles are a must, and the fresh (not dried) bread crumb topping -- delicious. If your tastebuds prefer a little excitement over everyday hum- drum mac & cheese, this recipe's for you.

I used a mixture of fine cheeses - cheddar, munster, (adds creaminess)a delicious sweet swiss, and the last of my feta. I also used raosted green chilis that I had on hand instead of the chipotles. Everyone loved it - I tripled it for a huge crowd. One note - do not hold it for too long before serving because it will firm up quite a bit.

I tripled this recipe and made this for 20 people on a ski trip Feb 11th - 13th and folks loved it. The chipotle servings won out over the non-chipotle side, even by people who didn't like spicy.

Delicious! 3+ forks, really. I also lightened up on the cream, using 1 cup of heavy cream and 4 cups of lowfat milk. I decided to forego the peppers, and went a bit sweeter, adding a bit of nutmeg and paprika, like a bechamel sauce. I also used panko breadcrumbs. I made a single pan, which meant it needed to cook for nearly twice a long. This will be my mac & cheese recipe from now on!

Delicious. DEFINITELY add the poblanos - even my non-spicy-eaters loved the peppers. The cavatappi was the perfect pasta to use. As suggested, I only used 1/2 of the flour called for, and I reduced the cream to 1 cup from 2, using milk for the 2nd cup - I'll try using 2 cups of cream next time to see the difference. I also added 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce & a dash of paprika. I mixed up the cheese, using 1 lb. extra-sharp white cheddar, 1/2 lb. of gouda, and 1/2 lb. of mozzarella. I used Japanese panko bread crumbs, too, and they were great. I think it can be even better with some modifications, but it's a winner, for sure! Reheats very well. Enjoy!

Made on a cold December night when craving comfort food after braving the last-minute shoppers at the mall. Halved the recipe to make one casserole and used sharp cheddar and wheat crumbs (as it was all I had). Used Campanelle pasta and it worked great, bigger pieces of pasta for adults and the shape held the sauce very well. I did cook the roux longer than it stated, probably close to 3 minutes, then added the mustard to it and cooked for one minute before adding liquid. Made it plain this time and served it with grilled andouillie sausage . . . my boyfriend said that it was the best macaroni and cheese ever. Used milk and half and half (didn't have cream) but otherwise did not change the recipe from the original. I'm happy I tried it and look forward to playing with it (love the Worcestershire idea, I want to try it with a smoked cheese, maybe gouda?, and, having lived in New Mexico, may try green chiles rather than adobo, or salsa as I always have that on hand) Good luck and happy eating!

This is one of those I'm-not-sure; let's-try-it-again recipes. The crumbs are great. Initially I was hesitant to try the recipe because eggs are not included. I was later surprised how much better I liked the texture without the eggs. I'll try this again with variations on the cream and cheese and perhaps even the butter. After a couple of tablespoons we were all full. However with the first bite everyone was saying, "Wow!" This does deserve a second try. I see where someone else added a drop of Worcestershire. I have a recipe that requires this in mac as well. A welcome ingredient that's hardly detectable, at least, in my recipe that calls for this, but makes all the difference in the world in the flavor, just a slight hint that perfects the final dish.

Brought this to a pot luck and had three people tell me that it was the best macaroni and cheese they'd ever had.

Easy to make and tastes decadent.

Yum-my! This is better than the recipe in the "Best Recipes" cookbook published by America's Test Kitchen. I doubled the chipotles to mix in w/the whole batch, reduced the cheese to 1 lb., used whole and low-fat milk only, reduced the flour to 1/3 cup and it was still gooey and delicious.

This was fantastic. I used chipotles for the entire recipe and wouldn't change a thing! I also grilled some kielbalsa sausage then cut it into bite size pieces and then mixed in at the end with the mac & cheese mixture. Out of this world. Guest said it was by far the best mac & cheese she had ever had! It does make a ton, can easily be cut in half.

This was delicious and a big hit with all diners, from kids to septuagenarians. I used panko bread crumbs, and the garlic crumb topping was terrific. I also used yellow extra sharp cheddar, but next time would try for white extra sharp cheddar. The crumbs are a beautiful golden brown that would have looked better with white cheese; the yellow cheese made for an unwelcome velveeta appearance.

This makes a huge amount. Had enough leftovers to freeze! The cavatappi pasta is a great idea! Adds some texture. Instead of the chipotle, I added some frozen chopped spinach to the milk mixture while it was still hot. I used only 1 & 1/2 lbs. cheese instead of 2lbs and even then it was plenty. Definitely a good try but still not anywhere's near mom's mac&cheese!

Didn't do the chipotle version, as we'd just had chipotles in another dish. Halfway through the prep, found that I had only 1 lb. cheese. Added 1 tbsp. dry mustard, 1 tsp. worcestershire, and some Tabasco, to compensate for the missing cheese. Strange how the whole family raved about a dish as common as macaroni and cheese. This will be the only m&c I ever make. Next time I'll try it with the chipotles.

This has been my standard macaroni and cheese recipe for big family gatherings for a number of years now, and it's fantastic. I usually cut the recipe in half and make it all spicy, and I use all whole milk, and I like it better than the other versions. It's so easy and good, you can't find a better macaroni and cheese recipe.

Yum! First time to make mac & cheese. Great recipe! Used sharp white cheddar, a bit more chipotles & wheat breat for the topping. You can't tell a difference when it's sauteed w/butter & oil. Was really rich. I think next time I'll skip the cream & just use milk.

If you are looking for comfort food, look no further. Made it in ramekins, and served each with serrano wrapped filets and zucchini/yellow squash and herbs laced with madiera for a great sat dinner party. Was really great, might add some chunks of smoked ham the next time.

Great mac & cheese recipe. My husband loved it. I'll definitely be making this again!

We also made the entire thing spicy and I just wisked the cheese into sauce before adding to the pasta. I forgot to get breadcrumbs so I wound up using the new garlic ritz crackers crushed instead. This converted me into someone who now likes mac & cheese.

This really gets 3.5 stars. I am always looking for mac and cheese recipes for the adult "children" in my family seeking comfort food and this certainly fits the bill. I made the whole with the chipolte (no real kids) and the smoky, spicy peppers set off the rich cheddar to perfection. The garlic bread crumbs were a great addition. One note: my partner found the sauce very rich. While I found the richness part of the recipe's seductiveness, next time I may try replacing the cream with whole milk.

I've made this twice and both times it was a huge hit. I'd eat it once a week if it wouldn't kill me. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who loves cheese. It's good cold, too (we kept some in a cooler on a road trip), but not as good as it is warm.

This dish pleased my entire family, hurray! I reduced the flour to 1/3 cup and cooked for 2 minutes instead of 1 to get rid of the raw flour flavor and cooked the white sauce longer to thicken it. Next time I will add more chipotle. Loved the breadcrumbs.

Made this for my son's First Communion party. It was great and everyone loved it. Some of the kids even ate the spicy version, Followed the recipes exactly except added some different types of cheese--what was left over from making fondue a few days before. I will make this again.

We have been searching for a Macaroni & Cheese recipe to enjoy for awhile, and this one finally came through. I also halved the recipe, and took the advice of reducing the flour, with rave results. I lined the bottom of my baking dish with Spinach, fried onions and ham to make a meal out of it.

Rich, creamy mac and cheese, but I found the version with the chipotles a bit overwhelming and the version without them very bland. Next time I'm going to combine the two. The garlic breadcrumbs were FABULOUS!!!

Pastey. I did cut this recipe in half but found the white sauce to be pastey. If I were to make this again I would definately reduce the flour -- likely by half.

Very rich! I use half cheddar, half gruyere cheese for a nice melting combo. I also add 2/3 of the cheese to the sauce while it is simmering, which makes it nice & smooth - then layer the rest of the cheese on top in the baking pan under the bread crumbs for a nice crispy gooey crust. A diet dish this is not, but I have no problem with the amount of milk/cream. This satisfies my deepest comfort food cravings. The chipotles are a good addition - a little cayenne pepper helps as well.

I loved this mac n' cheese as did the folks that just left after a long night of sailing. I did make some changes. To the breadcrumbs I added some snipped sage and chive from the garden. To lighten it I used fat free milk and no cream. Once the roux was ready I added a shake of worchestershire & white pepper as well as a generous dose of sherry. Didn't have enough chedder in the fridge so I added some gorgonzola which complemented the chipotles nicely. Definately a do again.

This recipe was bland, and not very creamy. We didn't think the chipotle addition was a good combination. We would not make this again, as there are many more tasty mac & cheese recipes out there

Oh Boy! The stuff in the box, it's not! Granted it's not something I'll fix once a week. Or even once a month. But most certainly for those special events when one throws diets to the wind. It is fantastic!!! I made a recipe and a half & added 3 tablespoons of chipotle to the whole thing. We have wimps here, but anyone who enjoys spice will want to add more. I also used Panko crumbs. Found they make the best crust ever. It seemed like too much cheese & liquid. So I added another 1/2 pound of macaroni. It was the perfect consistincy.

This is the best mac & cheese I've ever had. The fresh bread crumbs with garlic adds great texture & flavor. At first I thought 2 lbs of cheese would be too much but it turned out perfect with the full amount.

This is really good Mac n Cheese. I would agree w/some of the other comments regarding the high fat in this dish. Next time I will use 2% milk and only 1 cup of cream instead of 2. That will certainly not make this a diet dish - however... every little bit helps.

This is the best macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten. The chipotle peppers add a wonderfully smoky taste, and the garlic crumbs were a perfect texture and taste addition. I served with a mixed green salad with just balsamic, salt, and pepper----acidity to counterbalance the rich main course.

I made this for Christmas, everyone loved it! I did freeze some of it and had it a week or 2 later and it was great. I also used 3 chiles and it was a bit spicy for the average person...so maybe I will use 2 next time. I am making it again for Superbowl...sure it will be a hit. again. And I did split it in half so the kids loved the plain version and the spicy lovers loved the spicy version. Very good.

Very yummy and very, very dense. I didn't have chipotle chilies, so I used powder -- it gave it a great bite!

I made this for Christmas dinner. I used Penne pasta instead of Macaroni. The kids liked it. My mom thought it was too zesty. I thought it was too rich. I won't bother with it again because it was just one more thing to cook amoung many. It's too much trouble to make if you're already cooking everything else from scratch in my humble opinion. I would take it to a pot luck though.

I can never justify using all that fat in a recipe. It is just so unnecessary. Here's how I modified it and got a delicious dish: used whole wheat bread to make the crumbs, added lots of salt & pepper, extra garlic and paprika and toasted them in JUST 1TB olive oil. left out the chipotle, used 1 cup heavy cream & 2 cups FAT FREE milk, made the roux w/ 1TB butter. I found that 1lb of cheese was more than sufficient. I also cooked a box of frozen winter squash in the microwave and mixed it in the pasta(whole wheat)before adding other ingredients. Now I disguised the veggies and my 3 year old son LOVES it!

I really love this comfort dish. I have made it for a few years to nothing but raves. It is perfect for casual entertaining,ie Superbowl. You gotta hve the chipotles!!! I recently had a mini party and served a baked country ham with dijon tarragon sauce, this recipe, sauteed greens and the Deep DIsh Caramel Apple Pie (from this site). Ir was homey and delicious.

I made this recipe last year for Thanksgiving. I had so many unexpected guests drop in, and every one of them LOVED this!!! I LOVE THIS!!! I am making it again this year and everyone is waiting eagerly to eat it again. I add a little more garlic than what is called for, and I haven't tried adding the chilies. I like it better so much better than just plain ol' macaroni and cheese. It is definetly a keeper :-)

I hadn't made macaroni and cheese in about 8 years, then I came across this recipe. It seemed like an easy, mid-week supper - just threw together a salad to go with it. My family raved and took seconds - even the dieters! And said: why have we waited so long for this? why didn't you make it like this before." So there you go - another nice Tuesday night surprise.

I had never made mac and cheese from scratch before, but this was a very simple and delicious recipe! It is a pretty large batch, I made a 1/2 recipe and had plenty of leftovers. Next time, I would consider adding in extra bread crumbs, they were the best part! May also try a blend of cheddar and another cheese. Yum yum!

This rendition of Mac and Cheese was very good -- I served with Vegetable Stuffed Peppers and everyone headed back for seconds. It is a very rich dish, but for those who love home cooking - delicious. The chilis made the dish, don't forget them.

Homemade macaroni and cheese is a staple in my husband's family and my mother-in-law has a recipe she's been using for years. I made this for them one night, and it passed the test. It was delicious. I doubled the recipe and it worked perfectly to dole out to several sets of friends. Reheating was a breeze and turned out fine. I also omitted the chiles because babies would be eating it and just used store bought bread crumbs in the interest of time.

Judging this recipe through a cost-benefit analysis, I found it very dissapointing. It is an adequate mac&cheese. If I am going to cook with ingredients as *rich* as these, I expect to gain incredible taste... This, however, was no better than my usual recipe using only 2% milk. *Not* very flavorful.

I used this as a "blueprint", as I didnt have any chipolte. I followed the recipe, and also added 4 oz of blue cheese(which just gives it a little more sharp taste). Just like Mom used to make!

Although quite rich, a great dish. I used one big baking pan and made the whole thing with the chipotles which are a great addition.

This is an excellent version of the old classic, and I didn't even bother with the chipotle chiles. Also used sharp NY cheddar, very likely added extra garlic to the breadcrumb topping. Very rich and not for the calorie-minded. Loved it!

This rich dish I would make for special occasions. I substituted canned green chiles for the chipotles which was delicious. I also used penne past which gave it a more sophisticated taste.

I thought this recipe was disappointing. Considering the richness of ingredients, it suffered from a lack of spice in the plain version. The chipotle version was improved, but the peppers overpowered the cheese flavor.

This is the best macaroni and cheese recipe I have come across. I also halve the recipe and it feeds my husband, two small children and me with enough is left over for the kid's lunches the next day! I use a bit of cayenne pepper instead of chipotle chilis (for convienence) and everyone loves it.

This was easy and delicious! I divided the recipe in half with no problem, and baked it in a single casserole dish. I left out the chipotle and only used 8oz of sharp cheddar cheese. It worked great! I'm excited to serve it to my 2 year old, rather than the boxed stuff.

My search is over! I cut this recipe in half and it made two meals for two people, with just a little left over. He ate the plain half and I ate the chipotle chile half. Next time I get all of the bread crumb topping, because he didn't particularly care for that--but I certainly did! This is old-fashioned comfort food to suit two very different tastes. The recipe looked a little daunting--its not; this is quite easy to prepare. Try this!

I found this recipe easy to assemble and the taste was great. Definately a keeper. Husband asked for seconds. I made it with the chipotle in adobo.
