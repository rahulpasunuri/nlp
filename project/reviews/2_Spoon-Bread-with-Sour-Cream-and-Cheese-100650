Loaded with cholesterol, suspect in technique and poor in flavour, an utter waste! I would NOT make again.

This recipe is tasty, but it's not spoon bread. The cornmeal is all at the bottom and the sour cream/cheese are all on top. I think this may have something to do with technique - usually the cornmeal is added to the milk on the stove, so the texture is consistently creamy and pudding-like throughout.

This is a excellent Spoon Bread, delicious. I would defenitly make it again.
