This never fails to impress. I'd give it more forks if I could. Fantastic in the Shallot Dijon gravy. Only one my family EVER wants for Thanksgiving.

Made with the Salted Roast Turkey with Herbs and Shallot-Dijon Gravy recipe. Used meat from turkey wings in the gravy. Easy!

Wow! I am so glad to see so many chefs from Northern Virginia! haha.. I made this last year to go with the Salt Roasted Turkey with Herbs and Shallot Dijon Gravy and I have to agree that it is the best stock! After making this, I don't want to even purchase store bought again.. it is really a beautiful process as well.. I loved the colors! Took pictures the whole time! haha

A fantastic stock that's well worth the effort. It made the best turkey gravy ever. And my cat loved the turkey/vegetable mixture that was left over!

This stock was delicious. I made no changes to it. I made extra so that I would have enough to add to my turkey soups. Wonderful addition.

I made this today in preparation for Thanksgiving (prepare as much as you can in advance - that is the key to success!). Wow is it good! Brown your wings and veggies well. It does need a little salt...I added about 2 tsps kosher salt. Also used about 6 lbs turkey wings (4 bigs ones). I think this will be great for adding to my stuffing AND for my gravy!

This stock is perfectly seasoned. It allows you to use all turkey juices in your gravy without the addition of other liquids (except for the water in the stock). The gravy will be perfectly seasoned and beautifully opaque and rich. It makes enough to season your turkey dressing as well. It's Especially good if you are making the dressing in a casserole dish. I make it all year for other uses as well. I do try to cook the wings low and slow, so they aren't overly browned. The color of your drippings with determine the color of your stock, so watch the browning during baking.
