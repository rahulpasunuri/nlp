This recipe was great and took less than 10 min to prepare this with a salad. I used canned Chipotle peppers in Adobo, a about three cloves of garlic, just a sprinkling of Maldon Salt and a tiny bit of sugar, used the zest of one lime and a bit of lime juice. I served it with a lime mayo (mayonnaise mixed with lime juice and lime zest to taste) and a salad of cucumbers, tomatoes and cilantro dressed with lime juice, olive oil and salt. Super fast and fresh, the smoke of the chipotle peppers was well balanced by the freshness of the salad.

First time and was very pleased. I will use less salt next time. I broiled the char. Fantastic. I also generously brushed more marinade on before broiling. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for the first time. I did not have "ground chipotle chile" so I substituted fresh ground chile paste instead. I did not grill the fish, I broiled it for 6 min, per the recipes alternate instructions. It all turned out AMAZING! Perfectly cooked fish, great flavors, I paired it with sautéed green beans and sautéed red peppers. It was a fantastic meal!

This recipe got rave reviews - everyone from my fairly picky teenage son to my not-big-fish-eater parents loved it. Only modification I made is that since I don't like smoky taste of chipotle, I used a little cayenne instead - only about 1/2 teaspoon, would use a bit more next time. The salt thing is puzzling to me. Recipe calls for salt (which is table not kosher salt). I followed recipe and it was not too salty for me - and I am not a big salt fan. That said, probably not a lot of danger going to 1TB of table salt first time you make it. This dish is EASY and great for a dinner party. And it's heart-healthy, which is great for those cooking low cholesterol like me (www.golowcholesterol.com) I highly recommend this recipe.

I'm always amazed by people on this site who don't cook the recipe as written the first time they make it, then go ahead review food they didn't actually make. Anyway, this is one of our favorite ways to prepare arctic char. We've never found it too salty. However, I think it might be if you use table salt instead of kosher salt. Most recipes seem to be calibrated to Diamond Crystal, which should be measured at roughly twice the amount of table salt. If you are using table salt, then 1 TBSP is probably closer to the amount needed for this recipe.

WAY too salty! I would cut it to 2 teaspoons. I made it with salmon and broiled it. It was OK, not sure if I will make it again or not.

Nice easy recipe. Great flavor. Thanks to the other readers for the salt tip.

we've made this a 1/2 dozen times. But we have the fish on a toasted roll with greens & a jalapeno/lime/dill mayo for a take on fillet-o-fish sandwich. mmmm

Cut the recipe in half for 12 oz of fish. Forgot the olive oil. Used chili pepper since that was what I had. It was way to salty for us. Really liked the combination of lime and garlic. Will make again but will reduce the salt by three quarters.

Well, I can't say I made it in the right proportions. I kind of took the ingredients and made a little marinade of it. For a .5lb cut of fish i used juice of 1 key lime, a pinch of salt and pepper, realizing now I forgot the olive oil... and I used siracha hot chili sauce, a teaspoon or so. It was ok, but I think the citrus and fish isn't as nice as a basic balsamic or ginger soy.

Wow - what a great recipe. I'll definately make it for guests. I decreased the salt to one tablespoon as suggested by others, but I used smoked salt instead. I also cooked the fillets on a water-soaked cedar plank directly on the barbeque to give it that extra smoked flavor and to keep it moist. It's winter here at the moment so it took about 20 minutes on med-high to get it done on the barbeque.

Have made this many times - always turns out great and is a favorite of our dinner guests. Only change I make is cut salt in half. Works well with arctic char or salmon. Never marinate longer than 1/2 hour - it sokes in too much and overpowers the fish.

I don't see what the hype is about. For me, the flavors simply didn't balance and do the fish justice. I was sorely disappointed.

This was a great dish. I have made it twice now - once with arctic char and once with salmon. I substituted a jalapeno for the chipotle and cut down on the salt like the other reviewers suggested. The second time, I put the marinade mixture through my mini chopper as it was difficult to mash the garlic and such without a mortar and pestle. I will definitely make this again!

I liked this and will make it again, but with some changes. I found the salt overpowering; next time I'll reduce the salt, increase the lime and chile, and put the ingredients in a blender to make a paste. Even as is, this was a nice dinner with rice and salad.

Very good. Made one change. Had recieved dried Habenero powder as a gift. Had to decrease the amount because of heat index, didn't want to overpower the fish. Beautiful. My husband said it was better than a 5 star restaurant. Healthy and simple!! Try the char-very mild fish. Make sure to get char fresh. Beautiful recipe!

This recipe is outstanding and so simple. We used salmon and were quite pleased with the result.
