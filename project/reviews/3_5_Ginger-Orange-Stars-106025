I gave it 4 stars but there are a few things that bakers should be aware of. The dough needs to stay cold in order to roll it out, cut it, and bake without sticking or spreading too much. I made the disks and put them in the refrigerator a day in advance. It rolls easily when cold and won't stick to the rolling surface if both sides are floured before rolling. When rolling, pull it up occasionally to rub around and re-distribute the flour on both surfaces of the dough. After the cookies from one disk are cut, put them directly into the oven. Wrap the scraps and put them back into the refrigerator, then start on the next disk and repeat. Also add orange juice to the frosting in place of water. Fantastic cookies!

After baking these cookies for only three and a half to four minutes, they came out nice and chewy. To achieve this, I rolled the dough out to the thinnest that I could get it and, as the recipe suggested, used a thin spatula to scoop them up. Because of this, few of them got "damaged". They spread very little, retainging their shape. Orange extract added to the icing added an extract burst of orange to the cookies, but they would be fine with just plain vanilla. These cookies are a yearly tradition.

I am not a big fan of gingerbread but the orange zest in these cookies made them worth making the exception. I underbaked them a bit to keep them moist. These will be made next year!

A nice twist on a ginger snap . . . When making these, I didn't find that they needed more orange flavor. However, instead of grated orange peel, like the recipe calls for, I only put in the zest. It was easier to break out the zester than chop peel, I guess. Perhaps that made a difference? Or perhaps orange zest and orange peel are the same . . . As just a simple cook, not a pastry chef, so how would I know? Anyway, I, unlike other reviewers, didn't find it necessary to add the orange extract to the icing. In fact, I for-went the icing altogether, and opted for an easier route- tubed icing from the grocery store. Yep, I cheated. Sue me! Actually, the truth is, I forgot to pick up a pastry bag when I picked up the mix master. Next year, I guess . . . By the way, most of the stars didn't turn out exactly as cut. They spread a tiny bit- not so much that you couldn't see the shape, but enough to make them look kind of chubby. The only batch that didn't was the one I refridgerated for a very long time- over 24 hours. The more you refridgerate these, the easier they are to cut out and roll. Otherwise it is a sloppy ordeal with a spatula, over-extended patience, and a ton of flour.

I was on an orange kick the last few days making all kinds of cookies with orange zest. This was the first time I made gingerbread cookies and the orange flavor just bursts out at you, making this one of the best Christmas cookies I've made. The cookies hold their shape well even when I used a snowflake cookie cutter. The flavor was outrageous. Even after a few days the cookie is still moist and flavorful.

I have been looking for a truly tasty gingerbread cookie recipe for years & this one is the best! The cookies are delicious and I have had no trouble working with the dough - even cutting out fancy snowflake shapes.

Very nice & tasty. Pressed them & sprinkled with powdered sugar.

Wonderful cookies, great combination of orange and spices! They are good for days if you keep them tightly covered. The dough is easy to work with. I roll them out to 1/8th inch and only cook them 8 minutes or so.

These cookies are terrific, the best ginger cookies I have ever found. I have made them every Christmas since the recipe first appeared. I have no trouble working with the dough. I keep the dough in the freezer, take it out about ten minutes before I plan to roll out the cookies and put the scraps back into the freezer to chill quickly. I usually roll them thinner than 1/4" and only cook them for 8 minutes.

I left out the cloves, and used orange extract instead. This made it more flavorful. I roll them out a little thicker than called for in the recipe, and use plenty of flour so that they don't stick. Now they are one of my favorites.

I didn't really care for these. I think they needed more orange flavor. The dough was a bit soft and sticky and the icing was unremarkable. You could find better recipes out there.

These cookies were absolutely delicious, and the stars are very pretty. I used fresh orange juice for the liquid in the icing, and everyone loved them. Not fun to make, though. The dough was the consistency of peanut butter--a sticky mess. Stars were hard to make because the dough stuck in the points. Will probably try these again because they were so good, though!

I had a little trouble rolling the cookie dough out - it has to be as cold as possible. I also put in orange extract into the icing. They are great cookies and smell very festive for the holiday season.

Based on the other reviews stating they had to use a lot of flour, I used a rolling pin cover, which really cut down on the amount of flour. I've added these cookies to my annual repetoire. Excellent!

Rolled mine between layers of plastic wrap, cut the stars, and then put the entire thing in the freezer for a couple of minutes, and they peeled off beautifully. I also used orange juice concentrate in place of half the water in the icing as I didn't feel the orange came through in the cookie. They are very pretty and tasty cookies for the holidays.

A Thanksgiving treat that all of my relatives loved! Easy to make, the only problem was, like another reviewer, I noticed that I used a lot of flour to keep the dough from sticking to the roller. Great tasting and they will definitely be made again!

These cookies were excellent. I put a little orange extract into the icing. I am glad I did, it made the icing very tasty. My Grandchildren just loved them.

A nice tweak on gingerbread cookies. I cooked some for the full 10 minutes, and felt they were slightly overcooked. The next batch, I took out of the oven at 8 1/2 or 9 minutes, and preferred them.

These cookies were delicious! I made the cookies using a non-stick cookie sheet without the parchment paper, and they turned out just fine. I did need a lot of flour to keep the dough from sticking to the rolling pin. The cookies look great on a serving platter and taste wonderful!

I thought these were GREAT! Unlike other reviewers, I found that the dough was easier to roll out and cut if it was cold. I kept putting pieces back in the fridge. I also used lots of flower when rolling them out, and continued turning the dough over as I rolled it so it didn't stick. A great holiday cookie! YUM! ...And they last for days!

This was a new and very festive Christmas cookie, easy to decorate, but time consuming overall. I used sorghum molasses which is probably the most robust of all the molasses flavors and that turned out good. The dough must warm up a little when you take it out of the refrigerator, otherwise it is difficult to work with. Underbake these cookies, otherwise they become too hard. I used orange juice in the frosting instead of water; that gave it a better flavor. The overall flavor of these cookies was just okay; the presentation was great. I cut them in five different size stars.

I thought these were great! I used mild molasses (since that's what I had), and I liked my second batch better, when I rolled them slightly thicker (about 1/4 inch) and slightly underbaked them for a softer cookie. They will make your kitchen smell wonderful!

A decent cookie, but next time, I will cut down or omit the cloves. I think they slightly overwhelmed the gingerbread. Also, the dough must warm a bit before being rolled out--otherwise it cracks and disintegrates when placing the cookie on the parchment. They were something new to try though, and fun to make. Cheers!
