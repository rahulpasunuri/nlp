I would have given this recipe 4 forks, but since I made many changes based on other reviewers comments, I only went with 3. The changes I made were as follows: 1)Omitted additional chicken broth. 2)Preheated oven to 450. Decreased temp to 350 when added chicken. Cooked at 350 for 20min per pound of chicken (that's 80 min. for 4 pounds). 3)I alternated the leeks with carrots and parsnips halved lengthwise. I found the chicken fabulous. It was very tender and juicy. I liked all of the vegetables underneath except the leeks. I followed advise of other reviewers and tried to peel away some additional outer layers of the leeks since they were large. They still didn't taste good. As such, I would keep the leeks because I liked the flavor they added to the chicken, but I wouldn't eat them at the end. With these changes, I have to say that this is one of the best roast chickens that I have ever made.

I used only chicken thighs, as that's what I had and I was looking for something easy and using seasonal vegetables. The chicken marinade was tasty and the leeks were tender, sweet and delicious. This is a good prep early and cook later meal.

The two reviewers before me are correct. You can't cook a 4lb chicken in that time. I had to cook it A LOT longer to make it edible. This is the first time I didn't read the reviews before I cooked. That will never happen again.

I wish there was a way to rate as no forks. The reviewer before me was right -- there's no way you can cook at 4lb chicken in 40 minutes. I only wish I would've read the reviews before I went head first into making this chicken for a dinner of hungry people!

Unworkable, imho. As written, this is a recipe for underdone chicken (4 pounds in 40 minutes?) over charred leeks. Mmmmm!! There are vestiges of a good idea done here, but it's not worth the effort.

I made a few modifications to the recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for a few hours before baking, with some dried basil thrown in. I also added carrots to the bottom of the pan (halved baby carrots) and omitted the broth. I baked it at 400: 20 min covered with foil and 25 without. (It could have used another 5 minutes without the foil.) I really enjoyed it! The chicken was really moist and flavorful, and the vegetables were great as well. Perfect for the night of the first snow in a Minnesota winter. It was really easy too; probably a total of 15 min prep aside from the baking. Recommendations: 1) To repeat what is below: DO NOT ADD BROTH. There is more than enough juice from the chicken to cook the vegetables. 2) Cut up the vegetables small. I halved one leek just lengthwise, and another I also chopped into smaller pieces and the second was more flavorful, better cooked, and since it was bite-sized, I didn't have to deal with cutting strings. Even half-sliced baby carrots were not cooked as thoroughly as I would have liked, so I'd recommend chopping them smaller as well. 3) Season the vegetables with salt and pepper before placing the chicken on top Enjoy!

The basics of this recipe are excellent...the flavors are very nice and it's a very easy and yet elegant fall dinner. My only note, and this may address some of the earlier comments- make sure to choose small leeks, or peel a few layers off larger ones or you will wind up with 'tough' leeks. Gorgeous, for both eyes and palate. Will definitely make again!

we used boneless skinless chicken breast. The Leeks were overcooked and stringy and overall not a great taste. Balsamic vinegar taste was too strong

Overall, the recipe is quite good, the flavor was distinctively different, but I think cutting the leeks into smaller pieces would work better. I would modify this to use a cut up chicken (or even boneless breasts, cut up)and would slice the leeks cross-wise, not length-wise. I also owe a thanks to a previous reviewer, who recommended leaving out the broth. I did that, too, and the chicken did have enough liquid to cook them thoroughly.

The chicken was moist & tender, but the leeks were kind of mushy and there was a lot of liquid left over. I alternated carrots (sliced halfways lengthwise) with the leeks and they turned out with a better texture. The chicken was good but the balsamic flavor wasn't that noticeable. I wouldn't say this is better than other roasted chicken recipes I've tried, however I plan to make it again with different vegetables underneath and more spices on top.

I modify this recipe by using whatever spice mix I have on hand, using onions and whole cloves of garlic (I didn't have leeks first time) plus additional veggies I have around. I bake at 350 for several hours with a light foil cover for the first hour. Also, putting a small base under the chicken to lift if off the bottom of the pan helps, we improvise with the ring of a tart shell! Has become a family favorite.

I read the other reviews and took them into consideration while preparing the chicken. I added more fresh herbs and garlic and used an aged balsamic vinegar. I did not pour the stock over the chicken to preserve the spices and sauce. It was easy to prepare and delicious, the leeks were yummy. Wonderful fall dinner.

Great use of our herb garden! Recommend using fresh chicken (ours was frozen and a little drier); added banana peppers and doubled the herbs adding some basil. The leeks are wonderful in this!

Bland.

This recipe sounded great on paper, but I hated the taste. It was probably just that I am not a huge fan of sage... it did give me a great idea for chicken breasts roasted on asparagus with a lemon honey glaze, though. I would try roasting chicken with leeks again, but using different spices, and I couldn't even taste the balsalmic vinegar.

This was great. The kids and husband all loved it. The chicken was moist and flavorful and it even looked beautiful. The only change I made was to use red wine instead of chicken broth and to increase the amount of herbs.

The leeks turned out tough and the sage flavor was barely identifiable. We tossed the leeks and ate the chicken, but I wouldn't make this again.

Delighted to find a recipe to use up my fresh sage, this fall. Leeks were positively luscious, cooked in the chicken drippings! However: pour cold broth over an uncooked chicken? No wonder one reviewer found the chicken bland; this step rinses the salt & pepper clean off. I instead poured it in the pan and then basted the chicken frequently, once the salt & pepper had cooked in. I also moderated the temperature, as 400 degrees will char a chicken's skin before the bird is cooked through (especially because my bird was rather large!). Besides those two details, this recipe strikes me as a fine, simple roast chicken perfect for an autumn Sunday.

I used almost all of the ingredients for this (used water instead of stock) and it was pretty good!! And I don't usually like sage! I would definitely make this again.

This recipe needs a tablespoon or so of lemon juice or other acid to balance the sweetness of the leeks and the balsamic vinegar. It also needs salt, probably about a half-teaspoon, maybe a bit more. With those additions, I think it could be great, but when I made it exactly as directed, it fell short of my expectations.

I really liked the method of roasting chicken suspended on leeks in broth. The sage-, vinegar-, and chicken-infused leeks were delicious, and the chicken turned out perfectly moist and delicately flavored. I didn't use a whole chicken, but rather two large chicken breasts with skin on and ribs still underneath. I'm definitely going to experiment with the herb mixture, since the balance there was off. The rosemary flavor didn't seem to meld with the other ingredients, but then I also replaced the balsamic vinegar with white wine vinegar, so I think I should have omitted the rosemary as well. I guess I can't really pass judgment on the recipe as written, since I haven't exactly followed it yet, but I like the basic parameters.

I riffed on the recipe, using cut-up chicken parts and dried herbs. I marinated the chicken overnight, which gave pretty good flavor, and cooked the leeks in a separate pan with the leftover marinade. A good combo.

The Chicken was rather bland, didn't keep much of the aroma, but the leeks were just great. Next time I'll try this with chicken wings, white balsamic vinegar and a good dash of dried sage, marinating the wings overnight...
