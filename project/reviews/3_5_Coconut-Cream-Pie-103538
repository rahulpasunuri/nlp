I did all the suggested substitutions (replacing 1 cup whole milk with 1 cup coconut milk; adding additional coconut to the filling and crust; reducing whipped cream) and the pie lacked flavor yet seemed to have too much fat. The fat coated the tongue even without any whipped cream at all.

I wanted to love this recipe with all the reviews but sadly it just didn't have the flavor it should have. I did all the suggested subsitutions. Add less whip cream on top, it drowns out the coconut filling.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe as is. If you have ever struggled -and have searched for a good custard recipe then try this one. For me, this was a fool-proof-tasty custard filling. I have since used this custard/cream for a banana cream pie as well (adding some toasted coconut on the top of the whipped cream). I also have cheated on the whipped topping and used my favorite short-cut. Cabots whipped cream in the can- it is as close to fresh whipped (taste wise) as you will find in a convience product. Whole foods carrys this product near me on the east coast.

A keeper, just make sure to use coconut milk in place of whole milk and add coconut extract to the topping. I'd also recommend adding another tablespoon of powdered sugar in the topping

Made it today as per recipe, and everyone raved about it. Might try coconut milk next time just to experience what everone is writing about.

To "A Cook from Riverside, CA"-- which Southern Living coconut cream pie recipe do you prefer? I am guessing the April 2002 recipe, but the Southern Living website lists 3 different recipes and I wanted to make sure. I'd like to compare the Epicurious recipe to Southern Living's but would much rather make two pies than FOUR!

I've been making this for years and it was good as is, but I have spruced it up over the years. I use a chocolate/macadamia nut crust. (2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs made from one package of Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers, 1/3 cup dry-roasted macadamia nuts (about 2 ounces), 1/3 cup sweetened flaked coconut, 1 stick unsalted butter, melted. Finely grind macadamia nuts in food processor. Transfer to medium bowl. Mix in chocolate cookie crumbs and coconut. Add butter and stir until blended. Press crumb mixture onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch pie dish. Cover and freeze 30 minutes. Bake until crust is golden, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.) And I add a vanilla bean and 1 teaspoon of coconut extract to the coconut filling.

Sorry, but in spite of all the great reviews this recipe just didn't float my boat. I had to make 2 pies, so I made this one and my old tried and true recipe from Southern Living with most of the embellishments suggested by other reviewers in both. Tasted side by side, this one came out pretty mediocre.

Rating: 4
Incredible! Made this pie for my mother's 85th birthday and everyone said it was THE BEST coconut cream pie they had ever had....a religious experience! As suggested by other reviewers I used 1 cup coconut for both the filling and topping. Also used 1 cup coconut milk vs. all whole milk and 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/8 tsp. coconut extract. Didn't use the graham cracker crust but substited the Easy Pie Crust from BA's Nov. 2000 issue. The pie was beyond description....very satisfying and not too sweet.

Rating: 4
This pie is delicious with the changes suggested by others. I added 1/4 cup coconut to the food processor for the crust and substituted 1 cup coconut milk for 1 cup milk. The suggestion for reducing the topping to 1 cup whipping cream is a personal preferrence. I preferred 1 cup and my husband thought it needed the 1 1/2 cups. Either way this pie is wonderful!

Rating: 4
This pie was so adored by everyone who tried it! Being a vegetarian, though, I left out the gelatin and added more cornstarch. It worked perfectly. I also doubled the recipe, used coconut milk and coconut extract, etc. as suggested. The best coconut cream I've ever had!!

I would like to mention that, being vegetarian, I omitted the gelatin and instead used a total of 1/2 cup cornstarch in the doubled recipe. It worked wonderfully!

I agree, this pie is 4+....but only if you do the substitutions (coconut milk,coconut extract, double the recipe,etc.....) I'm sure it was GOOD before, but it's EXCEPTIONAL with the alterations. Somewhat time consuming, but worth the effort, and not at all a bother if you're baking because you like to bake.......

I go along with the previous reviewers. I substituted coconut milk for 1cup of the cow's milk and added a little coconut extract, may add more next time.If you love rich and creamy....this is sublime.

I was unsure if to give this a 2 or 4 rating only because of changes I had to make to the original recipe in order to have it rate a 4. However, I made this following the original recipe to the "T" without any changes or alterations and found this pie is over rated. That scrumptous coconut taste you expect to get out of an excellent coconut cream pie just isn't there. But, then, I made this again using coconut milk instead of whole milk like others had suggested; The difference is like night and day! It brings out all the flavor of the coconut. Then, adding coconut extract to the whipped topping is the other key to obtaining all around full flavor of coconut. I would rate the second pie I made with a 4+ using the alterations suggested by others. I just think the pie should first be rated by it's original recipe and if any major alterations must be made, then that may as well be a whole new recipe up for review. I would call using Coconut milk a major alteration because not always is that readily available in our homes when we decide to make a coconut cream. Some may have everything but the coconut milk, come across this recipe which holds a 4 score and make it and then be dissappointed.

Rating: 4
this was great. I followed the previous review with the chocolate recommendations and it turned out amazing (love chocolate and coconut together). I used regular milk, but added coconut extract to taste. Also didn't add the cream to the mix at the end - by accident, mainly, but it tasted fabulous just the same.

Rating: 4
I made this pie for the first time for a luau, and everyone raved about it. I did follow other's advice and used coconut milk instead of regular milk. And, b/c I was short on time, I made a few of my own changes, namely: used a chocolate grahm craker crust (pre-made); used cool whip for the topping (not too much); and, drizzled chocolate syrup over the top. If you like chocolate and coconut combined, try it this way. It was absolute heaven, and not a crumb was spared.

My guests really liked this pie, though in my opinion there was way too much whipping cream for the top. As nice as it was I felt that I was eating a whipping cream pie rather than one with coconut.

Fantastic! I used a Mrs. Smith's frozen deep dish pie crust and, as recommended, substituted coconut milk for regular milk and everyone just raved! Yum!

Rating: 4
I,too, took the others advice and substituted coconut milk for the whole milk. I also prefer a shortbread crust, so that is what I used in place of graham cracker. I must say-this was THE BEST coconut cream pie I (or anyone else at my BBQ) has ever tasted. It was thick enough to cut and stand up beautifully on a plate, and the taste was beyond compare. I will keep this as a staple in my recipe file.

This was delicious. Family raved.. including my coconut cream pie expert of a father. However, I did, like others suggested-- substituted 3/4 cup milk with coconut milk. Next time I will also add some coconut extract, etc. or something more to the whipped topping.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL COCONUT PIE!!! THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS TO MAKE A MERINGUE TOPPING INSTEAD OF WHIPPED CREAM,BECAUSE I PREFER IT. I EVEN STARTED IT A COUPLE OF DAYS AHEAD OF A BUSY HOLIDAY WEEK AND MIXED IT WITH THE WHIP CREAM WHEN I WAS READY TO PUT IT IN THE CRUST.I LOVED IT AND SO DID MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

Love this recipe. I make it almost fat free for my husband with a few substitutions: use canola oil instead of butter, and low fat grahams in the crust. Use Land O'Lakes fat free half and half instead of milk, 1/2 cup egg beaters in place of eggs and yolks, no butter in the filling. And use fat free Cool Whip topping for the topping. It was excellent!

Rating: 3
Great pie and really a hit with the crowd. I did the coconut milk sub like mostly everyone. Also, try using shortbread cookies for the crust. I did that, mixed with shredded coconut, and it was wonderful. For best results, let the cake stay in the frige for a day, and the flavors will really burst out.

This was an excellent pie that my husband couldn't get enough of. I did make some modifications that other reviewers suggested: added 1/4 cup flaked coconut to the crust ingredients, and used 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract + 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract in the filling. The pie had a nice coconut flavor without being too intense.

This pie had a good texture and was refreshing, but it definitely needed more coconut flavour. I used 1 1/2 cups coconut in the filling, but it still wasn't enough for me. Next time, I'll add coconut milk as others suggested.

Made this for my dad for Father's Day. He loves coconut cream pie, and this was no exception. I followed the recipe exactly. The toasted coconut really made this pie delicious. The whipped cream topping was just right, and not too sweet. I spread a thin layer over the top of the pie and piped the rest around the edge in a swirly pattern. It looked beautiful and tasted great!

I am usually a little skeptical about making cream pies, but this one was great! I took it to work to celebrate some birthdays and everyone loved it. I did make a few alterations: I used a traditional flour/lard/butter crust, as I am not big on cookie crusts. I also substituted 3/4 cup coconut milk (which leaves a balance of 1.5 cups of regular milk), arrowroot starch for the cornstarch, 2 whole eggs instead of the 1 large and 2 yolks, and used salted butter, but left out the salt. Great pie!

This was a great pie, and more dense than I expected. My guests complimented it too. I used 2% milk instead of whole and unsweetened coconut powder rather than sweetened flaked coconut. Also, I used 2 whole eggs rather than 1 egg and 2 yolks. I used store-bought graham cracker crust. In the future, I will definitely cut down to 1 cup the whipped cream topping. This pie looked so goodk, my guests asked if it was store bought!

I made this for a party and received rave reviews! People took second helpings. I love coconut cream pies and this is the best one I have ever had! Outstanding recipe! I listened to another review and cut the whipped cream topping to 1 cup of whipping cream and 1 Tablespoon of powdered sugar. It was just the right amount of topping and did not take away from the coconut filling. Thanks for another great recipe!!! Love your website.

I have made this so many times now and I've never heard anything but high compliments. Everyone I've made it for has loved it. I used much more coconut than it calls for. It's so tasty! It takes some time to prepare, but it's well worth the time and effort!

5 forks if that was possible. Made it for my husbands bday - he really loved it. Not being a fan of coconut, cream pies or whipped cream, I couldn't believe how extraordinary this pie is. I'm craving it already and I wanted to lick the whipped cream off before he took the rest of it to work with him. I could've eaten the whole thing myself this is an incredible recipe!!!! You won't be disappointed. The gelatin doesn't go on the coconut just the milk and then it's added at the end. The recipe is confusing because there are 2 - 1/4 cups of milk one with gelatin and the other in the saucepan with the cornstarch. Also used more coconut on top as recommended by others. Did I mention it looked like it belonged on the cover of Bon Appetit.

A delighful variation on the traditonal coconut pie and great for those who struggle with pie crust. The toasted coconut makes give this pie a firmer texture and different color than the usual custard based coconut cream pies. It cuts nicely. I'm not sure if the gelatin is really needed. I followed directions precisely but was curious as to why gelatin is to be sprinkled over coconut and remain for 15 min. My husband rated this A+. It is not as sweet or rich as many desserts but is impressive and tasty.

To die for - sure to impress. I made this pie for a friend whose favorite dessert is coconut cream pie and he said this is by far the best he's ever had - better than any restaurant or bakery in the country! Easy to make, but the coconut is easy to burn.

Rating: 4
I made this pie based upon the rave reviews that were posted here & MAN was it terrific! Very light & creamy & SO easy to make. A word of advice - be sure to make the entire filling on the same day, or the custard becomes too stiff to fold in the cream. My only change was that I didn't use the whipped cream topping - it seemed like overkill & I didn't want to overpower the delicious filling. I served the pie with chipped cream on the side instead. A keeper!

I am a complete coconut freak and a friend who owns an Inn locally called to say she had made this pie and wanted me to be the guniea pig...unbelievable! This is the best, lightest, most "coconutty" pie I have ever had! I can't wait to make it myself! (it won't last long!!)

I made this pie for a friend's birthday, who requested it. It was my first time ever attempting coconut cream pie and it was an absolute hit. I heard from at least three people at the party that it was the best they had ever had and they would not stop raving. The crust was excellent, so I would recommend taking the 10 minutes or so that it takes. Watch your coconut carefully when you are baking it by itself! (I burnt the first batch.) Check it every 2-3 minutes. And make more than 2 tablespoons for your topping. I did an extra cup and that was perfect. I will definately make this one again!

This was fantastic! I followed several suggestions other cooks had, such as substituting lowfat milk for whole (I used 2% and it was wonderful) and using cinnamon graham crackers for the crust. I also doubled the custard recipe for a pie that was sky-high and fabulous. The one question I encountered with the recipe is that it states to sprinkle gelatin over the toasted coconut, but it didn't say how much, and then it referred to adding the gelatin to the custard later. I just skipped adding it to the coconut and put the whole amount into the custard directly. We adore coconut and loved this pie. Our guests raved about it also - we'll definitely make this again!

I was worried as I made this pie that it wouldn't be good--the coconut seemed too lumpy in the creme, the topping seemed not sweet enough and smelled like a dairy. Turns out that everyone loved it, myself included. I used about a handful more coconut in the creme mixture than called for, substituting about 1/3 cup of coconut milk for the 2% I used for the creme instead of whole. Next time, I would chop the coconut bits finer after toasting before adding them into the creme, but on a positive note, my aunt called the same night for the recipe.

The best coconut cream pie I've ever tasted. Easy to make, too, but not quick. It is very rich, however, so I'd cut it into smaller pieces the next time around. As recommended, I toasted a little extra coconut to sprinkle on top-- I did not find two tablespoons to be enough, either. Watch the coconut carefully while it's in the oven; it browned much more quickly than the recipe stated it would.

This is a great pie. It was easy to make and best of all, does not require a lot of baking. It has a nice custard texture but tastes very light. I made the crust with a box of graham crumbs because I was not sure of the size of crackers required for the recipe. MMmmmmm!

A good, basic coconut cream pie. The only problems I had were: I should have watched the coconut baking in the oven a little more closely; it can burn quickly. Also, don't be in a rush when cooking the custard...it can burn easily. Other than that, a pretty simple, good recipe.
