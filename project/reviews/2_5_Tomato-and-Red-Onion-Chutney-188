Good but not great. I think it's more my fault than the recipe's... too much salt and not enough cayenne. There seemed to be a little something missing though... at least it's a recipe to experiment with!

Delicious--I used regular tomatoes and sweetened lime juice and loved the results

I'm surprised to be the first to review this chutney recipe, as it's very, very good. I needed to substitute regular tomato and white onion and it worked out just fine. I did add a small pinch of sugar to the mixture. This chutney was recommended to be served as a side condiment for Spicy Lamb and Lentils, also on this site. I'm glad that I did.
