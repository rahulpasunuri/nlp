I make this every Christmas for a big family dinner. Everyone should make/eat this amazing cake at least once a year! Here are some tips to cut down on the expense and labor-intensive aspects of this recipe: TO SAVE TIME -- I skip the outer chocolate transfer sheet thing, and just frost the sides of the cake with the ganache. If you assemble the cake the night before serving, spackle the sides with ganache and put the cake in the fridge. By the next day, the ganache will be stiff and give a nice textured look to the sides. Then you can arrange your fruit on top and you're done. TO SAVE MONEY -- This recipe makes a ton of extra mousse, and some extra ganache as well. To cut down on cost, I made only 2/3 recipe of ganache, and about half the mousse recipe. In other words, for the ganache, 2 cups whipping cream and 1 lb chocolate. For the mousse, 2 cups whipping cream, 1/3 cup light corn syrup, 10 oz chocolate. That was plenty to spread over the layers of the cake, and after frosting the sides with ganache I still had some leftover ganache to put on the leftover half-layer of cake for a midnight snack. Hope this is helpful!

A friend of mine was getting fired from his job, so I searched for "triple chocolate cake" and found this recipe. After making it, my friend just stared at the cake and shook his head. It was the best he'd ever had. I have made the cake on two other occasions, and even went so far as to modify the recipe so it could be made with ingredients found only in Brazil. Every time it is made, most of the people who try it call it the best cake they've ever had. When I talk to friends from Brazil who I haven't spoken to in some time, the first thing they mention is this cake. I don't own transfer sheets, so I tend to rely on covering the outside of the cake with mouse and berries as decoration. It still looks delicious, even if it's a bit low-tech. I'm planning on making this cake again soon, if I can find someone to split the cost of ingredients with me. It really is the best.

This took a lot of time, but it is all very do-able if spread out over a two day period! Off the charts WOW! I added a layer of Vanilla Buttercream which everyone seemed to enjoy as well as serving it in a pool of Creme Anglaise....yummy. I will make this again and again... Although not too close together!

AMAZING, but cost almost as mcuh to make as the person was old (60). Way to expensive to make on a regular basis, but ideal for the chocolate lover on a special occasion.

The cake is amazing, there is no question there, but as for the transfer sheets, if you have a problem finding them, you can easily and cheaply make your own (and for you purists our there I know this not the real way of making them, but it does work). Take some wax paper and any kind of colored chocolate. Melt said chocolate and make any design you like on the wax paper, let it firm up and then treat as if it were the transfer sheets.

I made this cake for my son's high school graduation party (about 100 people). I 4 times the recipe using a 16 inch spring form pan. It was a sensation. Everyone loved it both in presentation and taste. I used the spring form to assemble to keep it all in line as suggested. I also freeze my layers when frosting with ganache. My family decided this cake was even better then the Raspberry Whipped Cream Chocolate Truffle Cake (You can find this cake on epicurious also).

I have made this cake a few times and each time it sinks as it is cooling on the shelf. I've baked it 10 minutes longer, checked oven temp. and still it sinks. I love the cake and haven't had a problem with any other part of the recipe. My friends and family love it. I'm just frustrated with the sinking middle. Any help would be appreciated.

This cake was a blast to make and though it takes a long time to make, each of the component parts are pretty easy. I was most concerned about the transfer sheets and that turned out to be pretty straight forward and simple enough (though bought sheets that were 15" long - my mistake). The presentation made it all worth the effort because everyone took out their cellphones and took pictures. And, yes it tasted as good as it looks though I used premium chocolate since cheap varieties taste cheap.

I made this cake for Christmas and it turned out exactly like the picture. It did take a long time to make, and my cake sank a little - but it tased great. It's a very impressive cake especially if you use the transfer sheets (which were easy to use). It's also very expensive, but worth it for a special occasion.

Solid chocolate cake recipe. Don't be afraid of the complexity of the recipe; it isn't too bad if you omit the gold leaf at the end. When I made it, I adjusted the ingredients slightly for altitude (I live at 4600 ft) and it still turned out moist and light. One caution, take the extra time to let the mousse harden (about 30 minutes) before stacking the layers together. I rushed this bit and the bottom layer of mousse started to ooze out of the side. One thing I do recommend to solve this problem is spring form pans. I used 9" spring form pans to bake the cakes, then I used it to clamp the cake layers together to keep them neatly on top of each other. Also, I put the stacked layers in the freezer before frosting it all over with ganache so it would keep still. Also, instead of gold leaf, white chocolate curls all over the top make it look "wedding quality." Seriously though, I have never baked a cake before, and this cake turned out awesome. Good luck!

This cake is worth the extra work. Delicious and impressive. I used chocolate sprinkles for the sides of the cake, I could not find the transfers.

Rating: 0
I think this cake is amazing, but I love chocolate so go figure! My favorite part is the way the cake looks once the transfer is on and the cake is embellished. Some say it's an expensive one to make , but I say that it looks like a million bucks! I found some inexpensive transfer sheets on this website... cheaptransfersheets. com At least that helps the cost a little... plus it gives a so many ways to customize!

Rating: 4
I agree with other reviewers - that you should allow plenty of time to make this cake...not only for baking & assembling, but also to obtain a transfer sheet (which REALLY adds to the cake's presentation!) I used premium quality bittersweet chocolate; considering the cost of the (3 lbs!) of chocolate - plus the fruit & the transfer sheet, this is an EXPENSIVE cake to make! I piled the mousse in- between 3 layers, and spread the remainder on top. (Unlike some reviewers - I used ALL of the mousse!) :) Happily - the cake turned out beautifully - with no changes to the recipe (other than using my convection oven, for baking). Besides it's impressive presentation, this cake is delicious - although very rich! Although I have been baking for many years, this was my first experience using a transfer sheet; I found that it's not that difficult, but here's a tip that I've (subsequently) learned: Since not all (10") cake pans are exactly the same, you should measure the circumference of the assembled cake - as well the exact length & width measurements of the transfer sheet(s), prior to applying the transfer sheets/ganache. You may find (as I did) that your cake is slightly larger than the transfer sheet design will cover. If that's the case, you may need to pipe a design to cover the gap. Or divide the transfer sheet and apply it in sections, as alternating panels.

I've made this cake several times and is always a big hit! I even did this for my niece's wedding cake with with a transfer of red and white hearts with roses on the top it was beautiful.

Rating: 2
Honestly, I was very disappointed. I baked my cakes in a convection oven until they passed the toothpick test, but they sank as they cooled. Measured very carefully and followed the recipe closely, but the mousse never became firm enough, and the ganache has too large a proportion of cream - I would use 2 1/2 cups of cream instead of the full 3. Definately half the mousse recipe is enough - I halved it and STILL had leftover. The good news is that you can make a trifle with the leftover cake bits (from leveling the tops) the leftover mousse and ganache. DO NOT MAKE THIS IN SUMMER! I suspect many of my problems were related to the Kentucky heat and humidity.

Rating: 4
I'd never made a cake before and this one was not easy! But I tend to be the overachieving type and decided, "Oh yes, I can do this." I did do it, but it took two days and I didn't get much sleep that second night I spent making the actual cake part and assembling all of the ingredients. The cake was absolutely delicious and everyone raved. If I ever have to make a cake again, I'd give this another whirl, but you really have to be up for the effort. I found it very, very labor intensive, and I didn't even attempt the gold transfer sheets!

Rating: 3
This cake is a bit of a chocolate overload, almost so much it will make you feel sick to eat it. Cut the mousse recipe in half or you will have a ton left over that will go to waste. Overall a cook looking and tasting recipe but save it for that cholcolate lover's birthday or some other special occasion.

Rating: 4
This cake definitely takes some time, but I think the result is totally worth it! The presentation again is enough to wow your crowd (and you will need a crowd to consume it--this is a RICH cake!). I am making it for my second time now. I do it in stages throughout the week, cakes first (freeze them--then you can make them as far ahead as you like), then mousse and ganache the day before assembling. I'm trying the transfers this time. Last time I just used cut parchment paper and it worked great. The cake recipe isn't my favorite. I'm actually using a different cake recipe this time. But the whole package is so divine that the cake will do. Make it to celebrate a special person and they will feel like royalty!

This is one RICH cake. Awesome if you are a chocolate lover! The cake came out a little crumbly, so making 4 layers was out of the question. It was still super scrumptious with just 2. I added a little powered sugar to the ganache to make a frosting to cover up the whoops, worked well instead of finding transfer sheets too. If you don't want to be eating mousse for a week, half the recipe. Overall a good cake. Definitely need help from friends to finish it though!

I was looking for a 'killer' birthday cake for my good friends surprise 50th and found this. It was everything I had hoped. Gorgeous presentation, wonderful flavor and really not difficult to make at all, even with the chocolate sheets. I made the cake, ganache, and mousse 2 days in advance then put it together 1 day ahead. Added the berries shortly before the party and it didn't seem like a lot of work. I would definitely make this again and again. I agree that you should cut the mousse recipe in half, although the mousse is a very nice dessert on it's own.

Time consuming but DELICIOUS. The presentation is very impressive. This is one of my favorite chocolate cake recipes.

Lots of work, but oh so yummy. It has always impressed everyone. I call it the $50 cake because of the cost though...esp. when berries are out of season. I half the ganache and the mousse. Sometimes I skip the ganache altogether and I don't even notice. I just frost the cake with the mousse( I don't half the mousse if I do it this way). There is a video podcast for making the chocolate bands if you can't find the designed ones....cuts down on the cost.

This cake has a wonderful presentation! I've make it for several special occasions. By making the cake, granche, and mousse a day ahead, assembly is a snap. Try it, you and your guests will not be disappointed!

It takes time, but being organized makes this recipe fun to prepare. I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao chocolate chips, which worked beautifully and saved lots of chopping. Didn't do the transfers; instead, out some extra mousse in a plastic bag, snipped the corner, and piped the mousse around the edges (it works). Oh, and everyone loved it :).

It is time consuming. Although tasted good, not sure if it's worth the labor. There are enough chocolate mousse cake recipes that take less time. I baked it in a 14-inch pan for a birthday. This recipe fits nicely in one 14-inch pan. Sliced it in half. I cut the ingredients in half for a second 14-inch pan for the 3rd layer but without chocolate chips for the batter. Ganache and mousse were one recipe worth---I took everybody's adice, and they were just enough for the entire cake. A full recipe for 30 minutes, half a recipe for 20 minutes in the oven. I checked doneness, but they both came out dry (used syrup). I used orange marmalade for the middle layer, and a hint of orange gave a superb flavor. The mousse was too stiff to spread after chilling it half a day. I had to let it sit at a room temp for a while and used a warm spatula to smooth the top. I didn't bother with the transfer either. I used a large-ish round tip to make a "dam" on the edge, and the side was covered by shaved white chocolate. Being December, berries were too expensive. I used frozen sweetened raspberries (thawed well, drain excess juice) in the middle that almost looked like jam. Strawberries on the outside, blackberries between. The chocolate flavor is so intense in this cake, so berries didn't matter much. Looked tasted just fine.

i have lost count of how many times i have made this cake. it is the most amazing choco cake EVER!:) i have downsized the recipe for 9in layers... i have made it with and without the choco wrap... i have used the interior for a rectangular engagement cake, but with white choco ganache for the outside... i made this cake into a 3 tier wedding cake for my brother's wedding, every friend has requested this cake for their b-day...etc. so if you want to impress... this is the cake. yes, it does take some time, but it's not a hard cake to make... you just need patience and organization. i always make the full amount of ganache, but for 10in layers, i make half the mousse recipe and that's plenty. i have used high quality and not so high quality choco and the cake has always turned out amazing... only food snobs can tell the difference:). anyway, this is a great cake so organize yourself and make it!

This is the richest chocolate cake I have ever made or eaten. I pick a special cake to bake for each one of my children's birthdays and this one was for my daughter's fifth. I am an avid baker and was a little nervous about trying this because it is so involved but it wasn't hard at all and took very little time. I made the mousse and the ganache late monday night then baked the cakes late last night(Tue.) and assembled the whole thing today(Wed.). My kids were thrilled to watch it come together as it is quite a sight! I would suggest chilling the cake to set the mousse before putting the ganache on the sides as it will seep out if has gotten a bit warm. I didn't make the chocolate strips for the outside, instead I used the left over mousse which I smoothed with a warm offset spatula. I really looked incredible. I also skipped the fruit on top and used some warm blackberry preserves as a sauce.

Rating: 4
This is certainly one of the most impressive cakes that I've ever made, although I must say that it was quite labor-intensive. The perfect cake for a large crowd with a definite chocolate addiction. Were I to make this again, though, I certainly wouldn't have purchased so many berries as they were quite expensive and I didn't use many of them. I also would cut the recipe for the cake by 3/4, then make one large cake (to cut in half) and one small one. (The recipe had a bit of a problem with calling for excess ingrdients.) Finally I would have used less cream in the ganache as it was too thin and there was too much of it. Sill, all in all it makes a really fantastic cake.

Rating: 3
i just finished making this (a 3 day event) and had some trouble with one layer that fell. also my mousse turned out really weird which must be my fault because i haven't read that problem in any of the other reviews. it seemed like when it settled, a whole bunch of chocolate separated from the cream and stayed on the bottom - i'm pretty sure i mixed it well enough before i put it in the fridge. anyone with any ideas on what i did wrong - please let me know. i bought too much fruit and am only using blackberries, blueberries and raspberries. i think it will be a hit at Grannie's 90th birthday. rated it 3 for difficulty (although i think it's worth it) and my mousse and falling layers issue.

Rating: 4
This was just awesome, but oh alot of work. My problem was after assemble (before transfers) it basically fell and the mousse was leaking out. It was just awful. After setting it in a springform pan and chilling overnight, it was fine. I continued on and amazingly it came out beautiful. I suggest your mousse be very cold and your kitchen not too hot. Good luck...it's worth the time and effort.

Rating: 3
I would give this a 4 but I did have some problems with the consistency of the cake, although I followed the instructions exactly - they fell in the middle and I could not cut them in half to make 4 layers, but they still tasted super and the overall outcome of the cake was a real keeper. I will try this again. It also would be great made with peanut butter mousse in the middle and topped with Reeses Peanut Butter Cups or peanuts. It's very rich - this cake goes a long way for a crowd of people.

This will be my third time making this cake. This time, it was requested and I was told that it would be my birthday gift to him. It is impressive, and if you love chocolate it's something else. The transfers add a certain flair and yes, it's an expense but you find yourself using them in other places for "more pieces of flair" elsewhere. Listen to the reviewer that said "Just a tip for those that had trouble cutting the cake, use a long knife and before each cut dip it in hot water, shake off excess." That was my only trouble with this cake. :) And it's been solved.

Crowd pleaser! People can never believe this is a home made and not store bought cake! It is a lot of effort however. I have made this cake about 5 or 6 times now. I have made the entire recipe, but once in a pinch used boxed cake mix (and added choc chips to the batter) and boxed mousse mix. That cake got the best comments! I have also followed the recipe except made everything (cake, genache & mousse) white chocolate and used only raspberries instead of mixed berries on the top. Yum! The transfer sheets are not as hard as you think, actually very easy if you follow the instrux exactly.

THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I HAVE EVER TASTED! It also presents like a work of art. I omitted the transfer sheets (too daunting) but it was spectacular anyway. The work that goes into it is well worth it. Make the ganache and mousse the day before and assembly is a cinch. Be sure to have enough chocolate and heavy cream on hand!

Was not able to locate a transfer so made my own. Only negative was difficulty cutting cake because of chocolate collar.

This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful and delicious cakes I have ever made. I use the Chocolate Fudge Cake recipe, and have yet to attempt the transfer (I rarely have time after all of the preliminary preparations this well-worth-it cake requires). Perhaps my favorite part is the remaining cake layer- what with all of the extra mousse and and ganache, it seems only fitting to make the three-layer cake for your guests and an additional single-layer cake for yourself.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent, impressive looking and decadent tasting cake, albeit very time consuming to make. Leave plenty of time to assemble day of. ALso, I've never made it with the tranfer sheets..they do look pretty and add a nice touch, but the cake is over the top with or without them, as long as you don't skimp on the chocolate. I find Valrhona bittersweet the best with this cake...smooth flavor and not too sweet. Whoever you make it for should feel pretty special.

Rating: 2
Granted this is much better than any boxed cake around, however my issue doesn't reside with the actual cake, or even the ganache. Both were nice standard recipes. I did however, dislike the mousse recipe. Of the many mousse recipes I have used before I have never made one with corn syrup in it, but I thought this time I would just to see what it was like. I thought the texture of the mousse combined with the syrupy sweet taste was very dissatisfying overall. I do like the idea of using transfer sheets - the cake came out looking great, but the mousse was overly sweet relative to other mousse recipes I have tried before.

Rating: 4
My favorite chocolate cake of all time, even though it takes a LOT of time. For a striaght chocolate mousse cake, just use the cake, ganache, and mousse - withhold berries and frost with the ganache. Chocoholic's paradise. Have made it rave reviews many times.

I've made this one a couple of times and yes, there is way too much mousse and ganache but hey, too much chocolate, is that possible? I substituted a chocolate genoise for the cake, which I brushed with a raspberry simple syrup and added glaze to the fruit made of rasperry jam. It is a spectacular dessert but not for the faint of heart or new bakers. I used the extra mousse and ganache in the phyllo pastry cup dessert I found on this site - yum.

I made only the cake and used it with other fillings. The cake rose nicely in the oven, but sank terribly in the middle when it cooled. It was quite dry, especially around the edges, which crumbled when I tried to take it out of the pan. I am a semi-professional baker and have never had a cake turn out so badly, looks-wise. The flavor was fine, but you would be better off doctoring a mix. Definitely not worth the time and trouble.

Made this cake twice...once with the full recipe, and once with only half the recipe. (Both times I used milk chocolate for the mousse, which cut the overwhelming taste of dark chocolate.) While the cake barely rises with the full recipe, the cake was fluffy when I cut all the ingredients in half and used a 6" pan. I have to say I prefered the denser cake, because it gives a nice juxt. to the light and fluffy mousse. And yes, there is way too much mousse and ganache -- but use the extra for creampuffs or eclairs, because then you get two unbelievable desserts with less work. (And they will be unbelievable desserts to anyone that tastes them...this cake garnered shocked wows from a university faculty party.)

Made this for a birthday celebration and it was very well received. I personally found the cake layers too dense, and the sank in the middle after taking them out of them oven. The cake was definately done, took a little longer than the directions called for. The ganache was good, but way too much. I used less than half of it, even after I poured it over the cake to entirely cover it. Mousse was fine and plenty as well. Next time I will use a lighter genoise cake for this recipe, because I definately thought the combo of the dense, rich cake plus ganache plus mousse was overdoing it a little, even for a chocoholic. We cut tiny pieces and people had the hardest time finishing even those. There can be too much of a good thing!

Rating: 4
One of the best desserts I have ever eaten and definitely the best dessert I have ever made. Furthermore, the presentation is extremely impressive (and impressively easy to assemble). My only negative comment would be that there is a lot of waste with this recipe; following the recipe exactly I only used about half of the ganache and mousse. Considering this is a rather expensive dessert (but well worth it), I will adjust the recipe accordingly next time.

Impressive recipe. Made it for my boyfriend's birthday last weekend. The ganache had a tough time setting in (summer) room temp. so I had to chill it in the fridge for 3 hrs. I only used up 1/2 the mousse for the cake (other 1/2 managed to disappear from the fridge though). I also skipped the chocolate collar & just used the ganache as frosting. Absolutely delicious.

This is an amazing cake - one of the few recipes I've made that look as good as(if not better) than the picture. I made it for a friend's 40th birthday, and everyone asked me which fancy bakery did I get the cake. It tastes fantastic too. I made the cake, ganache, and mousse the night before, and I had no problems with things being too soft. If you don't have a cardboard disc or tart pan bottom, here's a tip - take two sheets of baking parchment, fold them in half and lay them across your serving plate, folded edges together in the middle. Assemble the cake right up to applying the transfer. You can then pull out the parchment with all the drips and spills so your cake is resting on a clean plate.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I made this for a birthday and took leftovers (2 people can only eat so much chocolate-mousse-ganache-cake) to work. Many claimed it was the best cake they'd ever had. Make sure you don't skimp on the raspberry jam (I used a triple berry jam) -- it provides a wonderful, fresh contrast to the cake. I bought all the ingredients at Trader Joe's (using the imported Belgian chocolate) and with over 3lbs. of chocolate and about 7 cups of cream, it was quite an intensive process!

Rating: 4
Rave reviews from friends. I used both white and dark chocolate for a blob/marble effect for the transfers. It took much longer than stated until the they hardened up enough to stand up -- I also made the mistake of not chilling the mousse enough... make sure it really is chilled and stiff, or it will melt and glop off the sides uncontrollably. Definitely time-intensive (took all of the afternoon/evening!) and expensive, as noted, but you can't go wrong with 3.5 pounds of chocolate, 7.25 cups of cream, and a mound of berries. It's a heavy cake. But people are still talking about it, and it's been over a month.

I LOVE this cake!! This will be my 3rd time making it. I lost the recipe and was very happy to find it on your web site. The combination of chocolate and fresh berries is to die for, and the leftover cake layers themselves are perfect for brownie sundaes. The only problem is cutting it, its so beautiful that you don't want to mess it up and its so tall that its hard to cut a pretty piece. To find transfer paper go to Beryls.com. They'll have everything you need.

Definitely well worth the time and effort! I made it for a bridal shower, and it was the talk of the table. I couldn't find the transfer paper anywhere nearby, so I used parchment paper instead. It looked fabulous! I was going to brush some luster dust on for sparkle, but ran out of time. I suggest setting the cake out 15 minutes before cutting. Dip the knife in warm water before cutting each slice. Serve immediately, or things may start to get messy. Overall it was definitely an A+ recipe!

I made this for a babyshower. It was a big hit. I didnt have 10 cake pans, so I used 8in, worked fine. Used another Ganache recipe. Bought the transfer from a confectioners shop I located in the yellow pages ($3). I started making this cake at 2pm, took an hour for dinner and finished at 9. Not including cleanup. Pretty intensive. This was a pricey cake to make. Cheapest chocolate and berries, over 30 buck. Special cake for a special person though. Absolute show stopper.

I made this cake for my husbands birthday, what a hit, we brought it to a restaurant and the staff loved it. A little hint on cutting the cake, have a large cup of hot tap water with you and just dip the knife in it, wipe off the water a slice cake and it looks beautiful.

Made this for a girlfriend's birthday. It was a fabulous hit. I love chocolate and fruit together. The cake does take a while to do and can be costly; I can see how that cook almost racked up $60 in ingredients. Granted I increased the recipe by half, used the best chocolate I could find, and had to buy cake flour. I didn't do the transfers as I made it sheet cake style. I also sure didn't need to increase the ganache or mousse. Now what to do with the extras? Hmmm...

I made this cake for the first time for a bridal shower. I had no trouble with the recipe or assembly at all. When it came time to actually cut the cake, however, things got more difficult. It took a long time to get the cake disassembled enough to cut and serve. Next time, I will cut the cake after all of the layers are assembled and frosted. THEN, I will wrap it in the transfer sheets and pile fruit on top. Who would know if it were already cut anyway?

Did everything except the chocolate band/transfers as I ran out of time - just covered the cake in the mousse & ganache until even looked great - berries went around the cake at the bottom everyone thought it looked beautiful. One change I made was it was for a bday cake for someone who loves raspberries so I ommited one cup of cream in the mousse (the cream that is heated to melt the choco) and replaced with a cup of raspberry puree. It gave the cake a subtle but underlying berry flavour and more depth of flavour! YUM!

My friend made this cake for my birthday, and it was the best cake I've ever had. She put a glaze on the fruit on top, which was phenomenal.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out wonderfully. The only real challenge was working on the cake after the mousse was put on. After placing the mousse on the cake layers,I would leave the cake in the refridgerator for at least one hour before working the rest of the recipe. This cake was definitely time consuming, but the taste and presentation was well worth the work.

This was delicious, much easier and less time consuming than I thought it would be, and the presentation is fabulous. I forgot to add the chocolate chips and brushed each side or each layer with Kahluah. Delicious! I didn't bother with the transfers either, and instead evened out the cake with leftover mousse and poured over the leftover ganache, topping with berries. Everyone raved! Will definitely make it again.

Yum, yum, yum! It took a lot of work but everyone was so impressed and my GOODNESS it was delicious. Definitaly a cake only for special occassions, but it's worth every ounce of effort!

Wow! This cake is out of this world! It is suprisingly light for how much chocolate & cream go into it. It is time consuming but well worth it. Regarding the ganache not thickening enough I found whipping it for about 30 seconds after it chills will solve that problem. I was told by my dinner club guests that it was the best dessert they've ever had! Definitely will make again!

I just don't see where one reviewer got a cost of 60 dollars without the berries. They must have bought every single ingredient just for this cake. 2 pounds of chocolate (shop around online!), some transfers and cream doesn't amount to that much money. Silly.

The cake was a little dry. Check the cake earlier to compensate. The cake was a lot of work but absolutely delicious. It took quite a while for the ganache to thicken. Very light cake, not heavy so the taste is rich but not heavy. The mousse is great so it is worth making extra to have the extra left over for later.

This was an incredible dessert. It required a bit of work but was well worth it. Still getting rave reviews. No one wanted to cut it at first; it was 'a work of art'. Then someone tasted it and that was the end. No leftovers here.

I had a bake off between a freind and I at a baby shower for our freind. It was highly competitive...bragging rights were on the line! We each made 2 desserts (we kept them secret until we walked in the door). When I came in with this one the crowd erupted with cheers and I actually got a standing ovation. The presentaton of this cake is incredible. However it tied for second place because of the 4 desserts in the competition 3 were choclate and 1 was a lemon cake. since everyone had to eat all 4 to judge, I think the choclate overwhelmed people and they were happy with the lightness of the lemon cake- which won by 2 votes (out of 26 cast). It does take 2 days for this to make and set properly. I would only make 1/2 of the ganache and mousse.(I added a layer of cool whip between the layers too) the only other negative was that it was so pretty no one knew how to cut it, by the end it was a sloppy yet delicious mess.

This recipe is a chocoholic's dream come true! It's very rich and the presentation is extremely impressive but make sure you give yourself enough time. I started it on a Friday night for a Sunday morning brunch and found myself scrambling a bit at the end so it would chill long enough after assembled. I also experienced some difficulty with the chocolate transfer sheets but only because I wasn't very adept at placing them on the cake -- one half was not perfectly smooth, which was disappointing to me -- you need to work fast and not stick your fingers on the chocolate side of the sheet. Also, make sure you measure and cut your sheets accurately. All in all, I would definitely make this again but it would be for a very special occassion.

Nothing the bad reveiws I read about this cakesaid was true. The cake was perfect, chocolatey, flat in the middle, and it wasn't dry. THIS WAS THE BEST CAKE EVER.

made this for my grandparents 64th wedding anniversary and EVERYONE loved this cake. well worth the time and expense and would make it again in a heart-beat for another special occasion. unfortunately due to the amount of time it does take to make, it can't be made for just any day!

This cake was amazing! It was time consuming but the flavor and the presentation were outstanding. When next I make it, I think I'll make it as a two layer cake (rather than a three layer cake) -- there seems to be sufficient mousse and ganache for this. It is a delicious but very rich cake. The finishing touch with the transfer sheet gave a very professional look to this spectacular dessert.

Rating: 3
I thought the cake would be too much with the ganache and mousse. so when I made it I didn't make the ganache. I just made the cake and put the mousse on top and decorated it with a chocolate band around the side and some chocolate curls. Turned out excellent, definately will make again.

This was the most wonderful cake I have ever made. There were a lot of steps involved but it was easy and in the end it was all worht it. I have made it 3 more times since and it is just fenominal.

I would like to start by saying that, with all of the expensive chocolate and cream, this cake cost more than $60 to make (I didn't even bother with the berries on top because of the added expense). The cake layers were easy to work with, but I found them to be rather dry-- I suspect that they would benefit from being brushed with a syrup before layering with the jam. The mousse and the ganache both set well, and I only had 1 cup left of each. The reason this cake only warrants a 1 fork rating is because it really leaves something to be desired as far as taste goes. The ganache and the mousse were wonderful on their own but, in combination with the cake, they were just too rich. We cut it into 20 pieces, but I could tell from the looks on everybody's faces that they were being polite by finishing what they were served. The raspberry jam tasted very good with the chocolate but did little to cut the richness. There are so many better recipes on this website...

This cake was time consuming and a little intimidating, but well worth it! Every mom in the bowling alley wanted to talk to me after I walked by. It was kinda expensive, but seemed forgiving (I tend to wing the measurements). I used aluminum foil, dribbled white chocolate, and semi-sweet instead of transters.

Rating: 4
This cake--with out doubt--was fantastique! I had none of the afore mentioned problems with the fallen cake or the mousse....as for that-- did you use heavy cream or whipping cream? You should use heavy cream. The transfers were very easy to use. I'll make this a thousand times over.

I made this cake for a bridal shower and it received rave reviews. The cake itself is very moist and fudgy, and easy to work with. I would definately make this cake again.

This is a really fantastic and terribly decadent special occasion cake! The ingredients are so fabulous, abundant and pure, that it's difficult to screw up the recipe. The actual cake portion of the recipe sank in the middle for me, which might have made it more dense than it should have been. The cake portion tasted like a flourless cake--absolutely fabulous! The sunken cake also make a nice cavity for the mousse. Any advice on how to make the cake not sink in the middle?

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it looked as good as it tasted. I couldn't find the transfers so I made chocolate bark from dark, milk, and white chocolate for the sides. Also, I didn't put fruit on top. I just decorated the top with the mousse. It did take a lot of time but it was worth the effort.

Rating: 3
I thought this cake was delicious. I did have some problems with the recipe. First, the mousse seemed to set up nicely. Once I served the cake, within 5 minutes it almost started to melt??? The second problem was the ganache. I did not set up at all, even after 10 hours! I did halve the entire recipe. I ended up making my own chocolate frosting in place of the ganache. It was delicious. I probably won't make again because of the complications.

I made this cake twice so far, and it turned out great both times. The first was without the transfer sheets, the second with. Everyone was amazed at the presentation.

Rating: 4
This cake was both gorgeous and delicious. I found it to be very moist and very rich, and very worth the $$ and effort -- if you aren't afraid of chocolate!! I did not use transfer sheets, just smoothed ganache around the outside with an icing knife and piled the fruit on top.

Rating: 3
If your looking for a cake that will win the crowd with the presentation, this is definitely it. However, if your looking for a cake more for taste, this cake would not be worth the effort. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious-but plently of other cakes just as good with much easier assembly.

Rating: 4
After reading reviews I halved mousse and ganache, I had more than enough. I also had trouble finding the transfers, but the cake did not need them. It was wonderful. I also used strawberry preserves and just put strawberries on top. I iced the sides with the mousse and still had some left over.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday, and while the presentation was impressive, the cake itself was dry and excessively chocolaty. The ingredients were very expensive and it took a tremendous amount of time to make. Even if you live for chocolate, this was no different than just eating a bittersweet chocolate bar!

fabulous!I made this for my sister's birthday,she being a chocoholic and all.The texture was dense,which made it perfect for soaking with a liqeure----which I did and it was.I loved the cake itself not overly sweet or tangy!Reminded me of a german dessert.Will keep this one for myself.

My friend and I made this cake for my birthday and it was fantastic. It was very difficult to get the transfer sheets to be perfectly straight on the sides,and there is no way that you can use all of the mousse and ganache filling. The cake looked wounderful, and everyone was impressed.

Rating: 4
As the other reviewers have mentioned, this is a weekend project. My Mom and I made it for my Grandmother's 80th birthday and it was a huge success! Everyone, especially my Grandma, was so impressed! The transfers were surprisingly easy to use and the mousse was delicious enough to eat on its own. Just be sure to give yourself a couple days to make this. It was definitely worth the time and effort though.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful and everyone enjoyed it. When I make it again I will be sure to let the cake cool all the way before I spread the peppermint filling to keep it from oozing down the sides! We had alot of fun decorating it, this cake is worth the effort.

Wish that the cake was of a lighter texture. Used edible gold paint over the ganache that covered the sides of the cake. Looked beautiful!

This was a fabulous cake. I'm a novice baker and was very worried at first to take on this challenge. But with a little help from a good friend- we were able to pull it off! And it was well worth it. I couldn't get the transfer sheet in my area so we melted chocolate on wax paper. A little messier and no gold designs- but worked pretty well. I advise anyone who wants to make this with transfer sheets to check local stores or start searching the internet sooner than later!

Rating: 3
This was definitely worth all the effort, and the compliments I received on it. My friend was extremely appreciative of all the hard work I put into it for her birthday. Based on the other reviews, I halved the mousse and ganache. I baked the cakes the same day, but placed them in the freezer. The cake was delicious, and the presentation absolutely beautiful. I made a little whipped cream and served it on the side. People could not stop commenting on how great it looked and tasted. I will definitely make this again---no special ocassion needed!

Rating: 3
The cake was beautiful but I did have a problem during the baking. The cake came out perfectly but when it cooled the center sunk and a large rim around the cake remained. I tried to use it to hold the mousse but that didn't hold out too well. Did anyone else have the same problem? Everyone loved the flavor of the cake.

Rating: 4
This was the most beautiful and delicious cake I have ever made! I followed the instructions carefully and the cake turned out perfect. I also halved the recipe. The transfer sheet was stunning but a little tricky to apply, mine ended up having fancy waves in it which looked fabulous. My guests still rave about this cake to this day! Next time I will try it with white chocolate.

Although it tasted great and looked very pretty I have made better cakes for less time and definetly less money. However I would make the chocolate mousse again.

Rating: 4
This recipe takes forever and the ingredients cost a fortune. I had to set aside the night before and the next morning to make this cake. All the hard work and money invested in the cake was well worth the reaction I got from my girlfriend. The cake looks amazing when finished. Tastewise, be prepared for a choclate explosion. I would leave out the chocolate chips and perhaps reduce the total amount of semisweet chocolate by 1/4 to 1/3 if and when I make this cake again.

Rating: 4
I made this cake for my husband's birthday party. The reactions of my guests was well worth the expense and effort that went into this cake. I was told to quit my day job and become a baker. It was the most unbelievable cake I've ever eaten. If you love chocolate you must try this recipe. I can't wait for an occasion to make it again!

I made this for Christmas and while it was very good and the presentation was great, the time and expense was excessive. I ended up using all the mousse, but have about 3 cups of ganache left over!

I made this cake for my cousin's birthday party, and everyone loved it! This cake did take a long time to make, but it was well worth it. The only thing is, it was kind of expensive to make. I am going to make it again for the holidays, but this time instead of putting the berries on top( not in season) I will just make a design using white chocolate. I really recommend making this cake, it has a very elegent presentation, they even thought I bought it!

Ok, I know some people hate it when you review a recipe after having modified it, but I can't resist jumping on board to rave about this cake! I don't care for a fruit/cake combination, so I made the cake without the raspberry jam layer or fruit on top. So what? It's still INCREDIBLY GOOD. Very,very rich. I used 3 8 inch pans, and with my extra layer, I cut the cake into tiny circles with a cookie cutter, which I figure will make adorable petit four versions of this recipe. I halved both the ganache and chocolate mousse recipe and still have plenty left over for the petit fours. I made the cakes and ganache ahead of time and froze them on a Monday, made the mousse on a Wed, assembled the cake on Thursday to serve on Friday. IT still tasted great 3 days later. The mousse and cake recipes are fabulous on their own- the ganache is good but nothing really special. I'll definitely be making this again. I used Varlhona for the ganache but plain old chocolate chips for the mousse (much cheaper). Both were great.

Rating: 3
I thought the cake itself was very good, and the presentation was lovely. There were a couple of problems which kept it from being a 4-forker, though, and I'm wondering if other's had the same experience. First, the ganache did not set up well, and I'd probably substitute another ganache recipe next time. The other thing was that although delicious, the mousse loses it's light texture when the cake is chilled (as it must be) and becomes dense and heavy.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday celebration. It was time consuming, but well-worth every minute. The only downside to serving this, was that the cake received more attention than the birthday girl. Using the transfers turned out to be the easiest part of making this.

Very impressive looking cake. None of the components was difficult to make, but overall it was very time consuming. Still, the results were worth it. Don't be concerned about working with transfers - they are very easy and add a lot to the "wow" factor.

I don't usually like cake but this is spectacular! I ordered transfer sheets since I couldn't find any in Utah! It's been two weeks and I still haven't received them- so I used the extra ganache as a crumb coat and then topped with chocolate honey glaze and mounded the berries on top- still looks awesome. Only used 1/2 the mousse and ganache. I think the 10" cake could serve more than 20. If you make the ingredients the day before it's a quick assembly. Can't wait for my next party- hopefully I'll have the transfer sheets for cake #2!!

I made this cake for a special birthday. It was delicious and made the event spectacular. The only problem was never having worked with a transfer. In spite of my mistakes, it still came out great and I would make it again, but only for special occasions because of the time involved.

I substituted the dark chocolate mousse with a white chocolate one, adding grated orange rind, orange liquor and a bit of dissolved gelatine to create a bit more stability. The crowd roared and demanded more. Strange how a cake made for twenty persons was devoured by ten. Definitely four forks.

I made this cake for a dinner party where the guests were definite chocolate lovers! The dessert was a big hit and I had to invite everyone into the kitchen before cutting the cake, it looked so nice at the end (and it tasted wonderful!). However, putting the cake together was a chore. I made the ganache, mousse and cake the night before I assembled everything. The 3 cups of mousse between each layer seemed too much, and I ended up taking out half that amount so the cake would stay stable. The top layer ended up breaking and slid off the cake, so I kept having to prop it back together as it chilled in the fridge. I'm glad there was an extra layer of cake that was not used in the recipe, because I filled in the cracks with this extra cake before holding it together with mousse and ganache. The transfer paper siding and fruit on top hid all the shortcomings on the inside and it presented well in the end -- what a lot of work!

I made this cake for a Birthday party. People couldn't get over how amazing it looked & tasted or that it didn't come from a gourmet bakery. I got dizzy from all the compliments received. The chocolate cake came out moist, dark & delicious - one of the best tasting I have ever made - & I bake alot. I used valrhona cocoa powder for the cake & baked it for 30 min. I would make the cake again & frost it with a fudgy frosting for a delicious plain choc cake. The mousse was chocolaty but not too rich it complemented the rich chocolate flavor of the cake. I used ghiradelli semisweet chocolate chips & only made 1/2 the recipe - which was perfect. I didn't have 8 hrs for the mousse to set, so I put it in the freezer for 3 hrs stirring a couple of times & it set up fine. My ganache never firmed up enough to frost the cake. Even after chilling it for 3 hrs. So I just spread a thin film on ea.layer & put it in the freezer for 10 min. to firm. I ended up using the mousse to frost & fill in the gaps on the cake sides. The transfer paper was a 'breeze' to work with & really made a difference in the presentation. Follow directions exactly - but do measure your cake's height to make sure the band is not too tall/short. I already have a request to make it for another party.

This is my revised review, after making the cake, freezing it and having my cooking class test it (along with aother chocolate concoction): they loved it. Loved the cake, loved the mousse, etc. I would still make half recipe as before (if you think it's a king's randsom in the States, try Tokyo where 1/2 pint of heavy cream is $3.98)I used 2 eight inch round cake pans (for 1/2 the recipe) and served 16. Still falls into my NFC (not for catering) catagegory: too expensive, too time consuming, but I felt compelled to re-do my re-view. Unless I have an extra $100, I won't make the whole recipe though!

I made this awesome cake for a birthday party and everyone just about died they were so impressed! And I didn't even have the transfer! I made all the parts one day and assembled them the next. The "chocolate wrap" was much easier than I thought it would be; I'd never tried anything like that before. The total for the semisweet chocolate is 3-1/2 pounds and 7-1/2 cups of cream, a king's ransom, but worth it! Delicious!

This cake was fabulous!! I made it for my husband & girlfriend's birthday. Everyone loved it. You definitely need two days to make the cake -- a day to bake the cake, make the ganache & mousse and a day to assemble it. You can use a clear acetate that takes heat instead if you don't have the transfer but the transfer makes the cake look prettier. I had ganache & mousse leftovers and used it on the leftover cake layer. Everyone was just amazed at the taste of the cake. It was definitely the best chocolate cake all of us had ever tasted. It is well worth the work. It is also one of the most prettiest cake to look at. Oh..the chocolate mousse was to die for. And the surprise you get biting into the cake and getting a chocolate chip plus the different texture of chocolate. This is definitely a chocoholic cake. (P.S. - the cook from Japan should try this again at the full receipe.)

I made this cake for a going away party. It went together like a breeze - I was in a hurry and didn't have two days to make it so I hurried things along in the freezer. Took it to the party and the ooh's and aah's over its looks were plenty. When we went to cut it it had been sitting out and was perfect to eat and everyone just loved it. I had requests to make it again from everyone at the party.
