Easy and delicious. Used creole in lieu of dijon mustard. Took a good 15 minutes longer to roast than the recipe suggests. I set the coated rabbit pieces on top of vegetables tossed in roasted garlic oil, added a little chicken stock, and had a one-dish meal.

Super recipe...easy to prepare, and oh so tender. I prepared it in advance, and tucked the sheet in the fridge. Took it out 20 minutes before to come to room temp, and then proceded with the cooking. Made an easy and delicious dinner for guests with a minimum of disruption

While I understand that the butter called for was probably to prevent the rabbit from drying out (because it is a lean meat) and for flavour, I omitted it because I wanted to make it a bit healthier. Instead, I replaced the butter with 1/3 cup of safflower oil and mixed it in with the mustard. The herbed panko could still adhere to the meat and the rabbit came out tender and juicy on the inside, and crispy on the outside.

Easy to make and delicious. Panko crumbs keep crisp and add the perfect texture to the meat. I didn't have enough dijon so I mixed brown spicy to get one full cup. It turned out great. Will make it again.

My italian nephew raved about this recipe - even better than his mother makes!!!!

This recipe was quick and easy to make and was happy with the results. My only critique is that the Dijon was a bit over powering for a delicate tasting meat like rabbit. Next time I will reduce the Dijon.

I make a menu each week from a variety of sources. In the past 5 years, I can name 2-3 recipes I have made more than once, there are too many out there to waste my time on repeating. However, much to my chagrin, I am writing when I did not follow the recipe. (I rarely if ever follow recipes to the tee.) Now that you have my disclaimers, this recipe was fantastic with wild duck. The only change I made was to soak the duck breast in milk to rid it of the "game" taste. My children who hate having to eat "game" birds even loved it.
