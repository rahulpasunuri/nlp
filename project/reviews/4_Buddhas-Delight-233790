This is a great recipe but since we don't eat just vegetarian foods I add the traditional pork meatballs. This is a great recipe and worth all the time it takes.

Have not made yet, but am looking forward to it. I wanted to add that this is not a true vegetarian dish as oyster sauce is used. Vegetarians can substitute with vegetarian oyster sauce (made from mushrooms). True Buddhist vegetarians would also not be using garlic or onions as they are not considered pure. Works for semi-vegetarians like myself, though.

We just made this for Lunar New Year and it was excellent. The sauce was full of flavor and everyone at the table loved it. I had nine guests, so I thought I'd double it to get leftovers, but it got devoured, leaving none, sadly, for the next day. I couldn't find soy bean sprouts, so I just used regular bean sprouts and they were great. I will definitely make this again and again.

I made this and skipped the Gingo nuts. It was good and not any of the items were hard to find. Kids did'nt care for it so it did'nt make it into the weekly rotation. Budda teaches moderation so I only added 4 cloves of diced garlic to this recipe.

This recipe is an easier rendition of the traditional Jai that my family has made each Chinese New Year for generations and geneations--easier in that the ingredients are more readily available than some of the traditional things in my family recipe, such as lotus, lily pods, lily bulbs, dried chestnuts, dried oysters, 'sea moss', cloud ear fungus-mushrooms, fried tofu and fermented tofu to name a few. These items ar essential to our family recipe as each item represents a needed/wanted component for the coming new year. Look online and find the meanings each ingredient represents! Truely a delight, referred to as Monk's new year fare, it is an aquired taste for most Westerners. It is eaten at midnight New Year's Eve and for each of the three meals during the first day of the New Year. Include sweetened crysanthimum tea for New Year's fare....Gung Hay Fat Choy!
