I made this recipe with very few changes (more garlic, a variety of tomatoes, 6 fillets of sole), and thought it was fine. We served it over brown rice as a weeknight meal, and for all that roasting I thought it turned out good, but not great. I have a similar recipe from the naked chef that roasts cherry tomatoes with green beans together with anchovies, and I think it's a better take on this idea.

I am not sure how this got such great reviews. Sure, it was easy, but the flavor was so-so at best. Luckily my kids were hungry, or they wouldn't have eaten it.

This is a great recipe. It was easy to make and my guests loved it. Add garlic mashed and it is a beautiful dish.

We made it exactly as the recipe detailed and it was really good, but next time we'd probably add some more heat with red pepper flakes. Otherwise it was a really good dish and will make it again.

I had already marinated the sea bass so I just used the tomatoes and a Maui onion. I roasted those and then put fish on top to cook. We loved it. Nice way to 'sauce-up' the fish, and great with rice. I didn't bother put veggie in the dish, just on the side.

I am not sure who came up with this combination, but here is the lowdown... I think the green beans were added in for color and texture, they did not add flavor to this dish. My kitchen smeeled wonderful with the ginger and garlic, however, the taste just wasn't up to par. It is an O.K. easy dish, but save you sea bass for something more elegant.

This sauce was so delicious, I was literally eating the remains of my plate with my fingers! The combination of the curry and ginger with the roasted tomatoes was out of this world. I substituted red onion for the yellow for a little more sweetness. Fantastic!

A four-forker based on EASY and DELICIOUS! Would be great with other fish as well, such as halibut!

Easy, delicious. I made it with flounder and cut the fish cooking time. My in-laws loved it and my mother in law made it the next day for guests.

I loved this recipe. The only thing that I will do differently next time is double the amount of tomatoes and greenbeans.

Made it for the first time last weekend...it was so good that we're having it again tonight for guests. My only complaint was that the roasting pan was difficult to clean, even though I had sprayed it with cooking spray. The side dish I served with the sea bass was the "Golden Couscous" recipe and I highly recommend that also.

Followed the recipe to the tee and added curry poweder that my mother-in-law gave me from Guyana and oh my god it was to die for. Even my husband was such in awe that he scarfed down the whole meal. He loved it and i loved. Will definitly make it again for me and for company.

Subbed cherry tomatoes, halved, used haricot verte and sea trout. Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding. Wonderful blend of flavors.

This was a very easy yet tasty dish to make. Loved it, made it again in the same week! I tried halibut as a substitute fish, however, as suspected it was not the best fish to use. Any kind of sea bass will work.

Oh, my...was this ever good! I think I felt guilty with every bite since Chilean Sea Bass is being fished to extinction. No other fish could possibly work as well in this dish, though. I used a homemade curry that was a gift from a lady in Guyana. I was practically orgasmic at the dinner table...figuratively speaking.

Very good, very easy. I used a little more oil for blending it all together, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. The curry and ginger were not too strong. Just a very flavorful, healthy dish!

Tasty. Everyone raved about this dish. The good news is that it is so easy to make. I used frozen beans, defrosting them in the microwave and adding then on top of the roasted tomato/onion mixture (with a little water) after that mixture had carmelized, for an additional 15 minutes. I also used sea bass since it was on sale this week -- terriffic. I'm sure halibut will be great. I also used an add'l clove or two of garlic and a smidge more ginger. This is going to be a family favorite.

In the late summer, when farm fresh ingredients are right in your back yard, this is an incredible dish. I have also made this with scallops on top. Additionally I have used the roasted vegetables with rice for a vege summer dinner. Truly incredible!

We loved this dish. I cut back on the curry and ginger using only 1 teaspoon of each. Using fresh tomatoes and onions really adds something special to the mix of flavors. However, I tried this using frozen green beans. It worked just great and I didn't have to waste time on the green beans. Made this at least twice and would definitely make it again - more of a winter type dish.

I loved this recipe, but somehow the curry powder and ginger did not appeal to me in combination with the other ingredients. So, I left them out, and it became more of a Provençal dish-delicious! I used halibut fillets and I make this one often.

I made this for dinner for my husband and I and had to use halibut because sea bass has been unavailable for the last couple weeks. Except for the fish I followed the recipe and found it to be just okay not very flavorful. I love sea bass but can't imagine it would have made a lot of difference other than the texture of the fish. I usually try every sea bass recipe that sounds good. This was an okay miss.

I found this dish absolutely delicious. I am, however, glad that I was able to read all the hints from other cooks. I too used canned tomatoes and think I prefer them. I also pre-cooked the green beans in the microwave for about 1-1/2 minutes to insure that they would cook completely in the oven. Lastly, I did have to cook the fish significantly longer than the recipe called for - but I was prepared for this thanks to the comments from other cooks. All in all the dish was first class and delicious, albiet pricey! I spent almost $40 on Chilean Sea Bass. Next time I may try this recipe midweek with some Tilapia and see how it turns out.

Absolutely great - sophisticated, but my fish-loving toddler lapped it up. I used canned plum tomatoes (I recommend one large can for every three portions of fish) since fresh are not in season, haricots verts in place of regular green beans and powdered ginger (fresh would have been better, but I forgot to buy it and the powdered was quite acceptable.) In response to the reader who had trouble getting the fish done, I used convection bake and reduced the "vegetable only" cooking time by about 5-7 minutes. The "fish phase" cooked in the time specified in the recipe and came out perfectly.

I thought this was a great recipe. Everyone loved it. The string beans were perfectly done. The curry and garlic were just the right amounts...just a hint. I will certainly make this again. It looked very gourmet, but was one of the easiest things I've ever made!! Perfect!!!

Great recipe. Quick to make. I use either flounder or tilapia which seem to work just as well. Stirring frequently helps keep the green beans from getting chewy.

Generally the Bon Appetit recipes are marvelous -- this seems to be the one exception. I was so glaad I did not prepare it for guests! On the first roasting the pan started to burn in spite of the fact that I had followed the directions to the letter! During the second portion of the roasting, I added very delicate curry that I had brought back from a recent trip to Vietnam -- it never melded with the rest of the ingredients-- what a shame ! The fish took quie a bit longer than the suggested 18 minutes (and I even measured the thickness of the fish). Then just to make things a little bit worse -- the pan was such I mess I gave up and tossed it in the garbage!

When I was making this recipe I wasn't sure how I would like it but I have learned by now that the reviewers always get it right. Not only was this easy, healthy and delicious, it was visually pleasing too! Highly recommended..My husband even scraped the cooking dish clean! Not a crumb was left!

Flavorful, healthy, easy to make -- what could be better? This dish is nicely complemented by basmati rice and a dry Alsatian white wine.

I made this for a friend of mine who is not a fish or curry eater. He loved it. He thought it was really rich in flavor. It was, and it was also simple and relatively inexpensive.

Delicious! I used orange roughy and skipped the curry since it's not my favorite spice. Wonderful, healthy recipe. I served with the mashed potatoes w/spinach and gruyere cheese from the same issue. Great comfort food.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest dishes I have ever made. I used cat fish fillets instead of sea bass and it turned out great. My family loved it. Cheap too!

My husband and I loved this receipe. Wonderful flavors. I found it a little better if I didn't cook the tomatoes quite so long.

This is a very good dish for all the obvious reasons. One suggestion...let the sea bass sit in a brine of salted water while you cook the first ingredients, rinse before adding to the pan and do not salt the fish itself. This improves the texture. The dish actually merits 3.5 forks.

I made this dish for my sisters birthday. It was outstanding! The only item I did not use was the curry powder. Definately will make again!

My husband fixed this dish for Valentines Day and it was outstanding. Definitly on our list to make for ourselves and company.
