Thought this was a great recipe...I made it for brisket! The brisket was delicious, the gravy amazing and everyone raved about it. A nice change from the usual recipe.

I've tried a few short rib recipes and this was the best so far. Did not add baby carrots or olives; didn't have herbs de Provence so looked it up and made my own mixture; used store bought beef broth. It was amazingly good. Next time I'll try it in the crockpot.

Just started making these short ribs for the third time in 6 weeks. It is really best to make the day before, cool in the refrigerator, and skim off the fat the next day. Skipping the olives does not do any harm. Perfect with polenta. So good! We keep looking forward to the leftovers and then someone shows up and there never are any.

This dish was a tremendous hit ("restaurant quality"), which was especially gratifying because the work involved in preparing it was very moderate -- while you enjoy the fabulous aromas emerging from the oven. Served it on plain polenta, which worked perfectly as a nice contrast to the rich sauce. I used the best ingredients I could find (beef stock, red wine, beef, tomatoes, black pepper, herbes de provence, etc. -- all should be good quality). I also increased the amount of garlic dramatically, which is very safe to do in a dish that cooks for nearly 3 hours. And instead of adding water to cover, I simply added more wine and stock to have enough liquid. Looking forward to the leftovers!

I usually order short ribs when I go out and this is as good as any ones I have had at top restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area. I used fire roasted tomatos and I cut down on the garlic because we are not supposed to eat garlic and that worked for us. For the olives I used Kalmata Olives marinated in Napa Valley wine that I bought by accident. They were great. The only problem we had was that we ate too much....

Good, but not outstanding. I made this recipe twice. I must say the first time the olives ruined it completely so I omitted them the second time with much better results. Although the recipes states for short ribs "not cross flanken", I bought them by mistake, it turned out greasy but good anyway.

Made this last night pretty much to the T with one exception, I removed the ribs and used my hand blender to make a smooth sauce. It was excellent! I made it early in the day, put it outside and the removed the fat from the top. Put it back on the stove to heat it up and then removed the ribs and blended it. OMG, everyone raved about them. I will definitely be making these again!

We ate this the night I made it and (after removing solidified fat) the next day - it was great both times. I omitted the baby carrots though not the diced carrot - the baby carrots sounded out of sync without other large veg pieces. This was great though - fabulous fall/winter dish!

Made this the other night and it came out great. Husband raved. I followed the recipe exactly. When it came to the grease I used my gravy separator. Just ladled the sauce in, put back any solids that I got, and I would say it removed at least 90% of the fat. The next day I only took maybe 1/2 Tablespoon out. I also used the cross cut flanken ribs because that was what I had and don't know why the recipe says not to. This will definately be in my recipe box.

Don't even think about eating this the same day -- it is SO much improved on the second day.

Definitely make this the day before and let it chill to skim the fat. Believe you me, there will be something to skim. Short ribs are amazing, but not so lean. Best way to do this is during a nice six-inch snowfall, cook this at least 3 hours at 275 degrees. Then, take it out to the three-season porch to cool (covered) overnight. In the morning, it will be frozen, but the 1/2 inch or so of fat can be easily removed. Reheat and enjoy. Ignore the comments of your college daughter who says: "This looks like somthing the Vikings would eat, then toss the bones on the floor for the dogs."

This was delicious. I used my new dutch oven that I received for Christmas. I added more carrots, celery, string beans and a few pearl onions about a 1/2 hour before I took it out of the oven as others suggested. I also kept in the oven for closer to 4 hours. It was very simple and my family loved it.

Rating: 2
Disappointed in the results. I have made short ribs a few times before with far better results. The sauce was overly greasy and was missing the "wow' factor. I even let it sit in the fridge before skimming. I think I should have done the ribs in the oven first for this particular recipe or used boneless which tend to have less fat. Also, per some other reviewers a splash of balsamic could have helped. I wouldn't go out of my way to make this again. Take your expensive meat to another recipe on this site!

Rating: 4
I made this recipe as written except I cooked it for about 4.5 hours because short ribs are never tender enough after 2 or 3 hours. The sauce reduced a lot while cooking and toward the end I added some water to keep the ribs submerged. I did not add the olives in the end because it tasted so good without it, I didn't want to mess with it. Ribs were tender and delicious and this recipe came together very quickly. I pureed the sauce with an immersion blender to make it smooth.

Out. Stand. Ing! Cooked at 350 for an additional 30 minutes; otherwise followed exactly. Served over mashed po's. Nicoise olives FTW (ask your kids).

Since short ribs were pretty expensive, I made this recipe with two thick boneless pot roasts that I purchased at Sam's club. I cooked it in my staub dutch oven. My sons loved it. Will definitely make again. * served with creme fraise mashed potatoes.

Fabulous! I cooked it in my slow-cooker for several hours until the meat was falling off the bone. The olives (I used nicoise) really added something special to it. I exclaimed out loud when I tasted it!!

Wow - this a wonderful chilly night meal. It can cook for much longer at about 250 degrees. We kept ours in the Dutch oven for about 5 1/2 hours and it was fall-off-the-bone tender. I used San Marzano tomatoes and a little tomato paste and it made it very rich and fabulous. We served it with a cauliflower mash baked with Gruyere cheese and it was a terrific pairing. Great for entertaining b/c it can cook all day and mostly be ready when guests arrive.

This was a great dish but it took hours longer for the meat to fall off the bone than indicated in the recipe. I added mushrooms and balsamic vinegar which helped bring out the flavor. The ribs were very fatty so next time I will use a leaner short rib and possibly try a slow cooker.

This is a great recipe! Never made short ribs before & they turned out wonderfully. Didn't use the herbs or as much garlic (only 4 large cloves)but threw in a bunch of fresh thyme & added a parsnip at the end. Maybe my oven needs calibrating but at 300 degrees & 2 hours the ribs were still not falling off the bone. Increased temp to 325 and let it go another hour. Perfect!

The first time I made this I used short ribs and it was delicious. Since then I've used a pot roast and this is hands down the best roast I've ever had. The flavors are concentrated and delicious. The olives really add a wonderful switch up, and I like to add green beans in at the end as well. Serve it over mashed potatoes and it is comfort food at it's best.

This is a very good recipe for short ribs and easy to make. I cooked it a day ahead and refrigerated it overnight which made it easy to take out all the grease. It also gives the meat a chance to gain more flavor.

This was a big hit with my family -- my son specifically requested that I save the recipe so we can have it again. I halved the liquids, added a large handful of cippolini onions, and skipped the extra carrots and olives. After baking, refrigerated overnight so that I could easily skim off any extra fat before warming to serve -- over polenta, yummy!!!

Not the best short ribs ever. I can't say that I followed the recipe exactly but I have cooked enough to know that my changes weren't the reason the end result was just ok.

Rating: 3
I prepared the recipe as closely as possible to the original. (Sometimes I'm tempted to tinker but not last night.) It was pretty labor intensive. The result is very flavorful, but I'm not sure it warrants all the fiddling around. I make a fine potroast with essentially identical ingredients (less wine, rather less garlic, no olives) which is much less complex to prepare and which, we both agreed, tastes virtually the same as this recipe. Don't get me wrong; this was very good eating, but for for a virtually identical result, I prefer to stick with my simpler pot roast route, which involves 25 minutes with the seasoned, lightly-floured roast in a very hot oven in place of all the manipulations with the short ribs in the pot. Based on this, I may try adding more wine during the long baking step and reducing the volume as was done here.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I made it in the crockpot. I forgot the tomatoes, and added some dried mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. There was an enormous amount of fat, so about 2 hours before serving, I ladled out most of the juice and refrigerated it for an hour or so til the fat congealed. I scooped off the fat and added back the broth. Really terrific.

neither my boyfriend nor i are particularly big fans of ribs, but this recipe has changed our world! i had only 1.5 lbs ribs, but used the recommended amounts of the other ingredients (except garlic- used 3 cloves); also, i used kale in lieu of the celery, and a little basalmic vinegar in lieu of the wine.i added 8 golfball sized red potatoes. yield: 4 servings. supper experience: priceless

Friends have requested this one again. I followed this one to a 'T'. I used Zin ($10.00) and served a nicer Zin with dinner. Perfect. I did not use pre-cut small carrots. I bought baby carrots with the tops still on at Whole Foods. They taste like the real thing. Be careful not to add to much liquid. I bought frozen Veal Glaze instead of canned beef broth. Read a list of the ingredients on a can of beef broth. You don't want this in your recipe. Perfect.

I'm not a cook, but decided to make this and mashed potatoes for a friend that recently had a baby. I was shocked at the price of the meat (next time I'll shop around and not go to an expensive local markey!). But, it was worth every penny! It does make 6 generous servings. The recipe was easy to follow and turned out absolutely delicious - even though I forgot to add the olives in the end.

This recipe is unbelievable! It took a lot of time but it was soooo worth it. The meat just falls off the bones and the sauce is fantastic! I skipped the olives , parsley and baby carrots. I served this over homemade polenta and my dinner guests had fourths, they liked it so much.

This recipe was very good.I did as another reviewer did and browned the short ribs in the oven vs. on the stove top. After all other steps of the recipe were followed I baked it in the oven for 5 1/2 hours. Then after removing the meat and bones reduced the sauce by half then serving the stew over wide egg noodles. I did try the olives seperately with my portion and was glad I didn't add them to the whole recipe.My family loved it, this was quite tasty.

Unbelieveable complex flavors in this dish. I needed an impressive menu for a french dinner (for a fundraiser for a friend). It was perfect because it was 1) deliciously impressive and, 2) It can be made the day before and reheated. I did a practice run and it was obviously a no-fail recipe. Try it, you will be very pleased with the results!

This was AWESOME! Even our 16 year old daughter, my pickiest eater, devoured this. Did a few things a little differently. Browned the ribs in bacon grease rather than oil and then followed the recipe through the "bring wine mixture to a boil" stage. I did the braising in a large slow cooker. Poured the wine and tomatoes over the ribs. Used 2 Tbs of tomato paste with about a half cup of beef broth to thoroughly deglaze the pan. Poured all of the broth over the ribs with a quarter cup of white balsamic vinegar then fired up the slow cooker for six hours. Put the baby carrots in at hour 4 and added the olives at hour five. Wow!! This was great served over flat egg noodles with a salad. Can't wait to get at those leftovers...if my wife and kids don't get to them first.

I had been wanting to try this recipe for quite some time...and now I'm sorry to have waited so long. It's just outstanding. My guy gave it an A++. I used lean, boneless short ribs. Used half the amount of meat, but the full recipe for everything else. I followed the recipe pretty closely with the exception of adding about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Also, mine took about 3-1/2 hours to cook to the desired tenderness. Served it with soft polenta with mascarpone and a great salad. Definitely would serve this to company. It's a winner! Thanks for another great recipe.

Two ingredients can make this dish great: leeks and balsamic vinegar. I swapped leeks for celery and added balsamic vinegar--started with about a tablespoon and adjusted from there. Also, the liquid takes at least 20 minutes to cook down to a sauce. Very delicious.

This was amazing! Followed the recipe, but used kalamata olives instead of the nicoise, which I think gave it a deeper, richer flavor. Also used super lean short ribs--Holiday Market just happened to have some. Meat was still beautifully tender and flavorful--despite the lack of fat. Great recipe!

This dish was great, perfect for a cold day. I added 1/3 cup mushrooms after adding the broth. I also simmered on my stove for 4 hours rather than placing the entire thing in the oven. The olives added a depthness that the recipe would not have been the same without. Even my very picky boyfriend loved it.

This is a great recipe for a wonderful dish, very wine friendly, and good to make for a dinner party because it can all be done ahead. I took some tips from the TRU Cookbook, and braised the meat in the oven at 250 for several hours. Then I cooled everything, and refrigerated overnight. It is then easy to scrape off the fat from the sauce. When ready to serve, warm up the meat pieces in a 300 degree oven, covered with foil and a bit of the sauce. Take the reamining sauce and turn it into liquid velvet!!! as follows. Heat some oil in pan, cook some carrots, onion, and celery until softened and beginning to caramelize, then add the braising liquid, and cook over low heat for 1 hour. Strain out the vegetables, and continue to reduce the liquid over low heat until very thick. ( I also placed some fresh thyme and a bay leaf in with the veggies.) I served the warmed meat over mashed potatoes, and drizzled with the thick sauce. OMG!!! The flavor of the dish is very complex, with many layers of yumminess. I cannot give this recipe 4 forks, because I think it was much better with my modifications ala TRU. it was definitely better the second day, so again it's wonderful for a part. Enjoy.

THE BEST Short Rib recipe EVER! I ended up braising the ribs in the oven instead of stove top, at 425 degrees in a roasting pan for about an hour (don't forget to deglaze pan), meanwhile minced the onion, carrot and celery in the cuisinart. Sauteed that mixture in a couple tablespoons of fat from the braised ribs instead of the oil. Did not add the olives at the end, per my honey's request, and served his with wide egg noodles and mine with a baked sweet potato that I squeezed out of the skin. I did cook the mixture the day before and then refrigerated, scooped the congealed fat out the next night and heated in oven at 350 with the sweet potatoes on a rack below. Vonderbar! Love, love, love it. Highly recommend.

Fabulous! Very little prep work. It took only 15 minutes to chop everything by hand. I braised the ribs at the same time and followed the recipe exactly. We absolutely loved this dish. WOW! Sauce was only slightly thin but we did not mind as we put over baked potatoe as our side dish. The aroma during the baking cycle was gorgeous. I used a 2000 Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon as the wine. I will serve this recipe again!

This was good and was definitely comfort food, but just not great for the amount of work involved. I guess I expected it to be over the top, given the intro, and it just wasn't. I did follow the recipe to the letter and the sauce was way too thin.

This is perfect comfort food. I made about half the recipe for my wife and I and two daughters (no leftovers). They all loved it, (wife: "you outdid yourself"). I wouldn't serve this to guests as the ribs are a little fatty. The sauce has a very nice flavor.

I followed the recipe except that I left out the baby carrots. It was too watery and not very flavorful. I think it should be baked without a cover to reduce the sauce significantly.

I made this as written and it was absolutely delicious. It also was fairly easy and I made it the day before so all the work was done beforehand and it kept me out of the kithcen.

This is NOT baby back ribs folks. It is a slow cooked, hearty winter dish. If you want BBQ sauce, try a summer grilling dish, this is more of a stew (i.e. slowly cooked, and simmered to perfection). The meat was tender and delicious. Cooked to the directions ("falling off the bone") you can't miss. You want BBQ - go to Chili's.

We like more traditional BBQ ribs. This recipe would be much better & easier to make with a roast. My kitchen was a mess from all the transfering of meat & juices. I took the left over juices and vegatables and pureed them into a delicious spaghetti sauce.

I have made this several times after my gourmet buddies made it for me. It is fabulous. The sauce that's created with the wine (Merlot), beef broth (I always use homemade) and tomatoes is magic. I have served it on the same day, but it is even better if cooked the day before it's served.

Excellent savory recipe. I have made it many times. I render the ribs in the oven rather than in the pan; much cleaner and it takes out a lot of fat. Don't be afraid to try it!!: Place the ribs bone side down in shallow roasting pan, sprinkle with salt & pepper, and roast at 450 degrees for 45 minutes. Drain fat out of pan with baster and return ribs to oven for about 15 minutes more. Meanwhile you can sautee onions, etc.. Be sure to deglaze the roasting pan after removing the ribs by adding the wine and/or broth, return it to the oven for a few minutes and then scrape up the bits before adding to the onion mixture. Add the ribs and return to the oven and cook as directed.

Rich, rich, rich! I made this for someone who loves short ribs - and he said it was the best he'd ever had. I've also used the basics from this recipe [wine, aromatics, herbs, tomatoes, broth] as the foundation for a stew w/meat, potatoes, mushrooms, greenbeans, carrots. It was amazing, too.

I loved this dish, and got rave reviews! I browned the ribs on the gas grill at low heat. I left out the olives (I forgot them) and added a few dashes of liquid smoke for a slight smokey flavor! I made 15 lbs at one time and cooked them in a covered turkey roster in the over. These MUST cook for at least 3 hours to tenderize the ribs.

expected more, added lemon zest, still needs something, maybe a dose of balsamic vinegar? definitely make it a day or two ahead, like the notes recommend.
