Delicious! I only used 1/2 a stick of butter and some olive oil though. The sauce was still fantastic and the whole family thoroughly enjoyed it. Quick, effortless and flavorful.

This is one of my staples now. I make it for quick family dinners and also for company and it is always great. I use less butter, some olive oil and white cooking wine. Quick, tasty and easy!

I loved this dish but made a couple of changes. First, I only used 1/2 stick butter (sorry Julia Child!). Then I added some crushed red chili peppers. I added about 1/8 cup of dry white wine at the end to add a bit of liquid. I also added some thinly sliced lemon wedges towards the end of the cooking time. They softened up and added a nice visual addition to the dish. I served the shrimp over white rice that I made with chicken broth and carmelized onions (a pilaf).This was super quick and easy to make. I will be making this again!

What a fast, flavorful dish. We were pleasantly surprised at how much sauce is created in the dish while the shrimp cooks.

We just finished eating this. Delicous!! I took others' advice to use only 1 stick of butter and add 1/2 cup of white wine. Rather than using parsley, I used 2 tablespoons of fresh oregano, which I feel offers a stronger flavor that's delicious with butter and garlic. I baked the shrimp for 5 minutes before turning and then just another 3 after adding the lemon juice, zest, and oregano. One modification I would make next time is to reduce the amount of lemon juice. I found the flavor and tanginess a little overwhelming. By the way, I served this over brown rice that had been cooked in chicken broth with the zest of 1 lemon. I poured the sauce from the shrimp over the rice. Will make this again and again.

Tasty and not difficult. I used the wine and butter combination as recommended and sauteed this instead of baking. Next time I will decrease the lemon zest and increase the lemon juice, otherwise quite good.

Incredibly easy. I think the cooking time could have been reduced by a couple minutes. I used 1/2 wine & 1/2 butter as many recommended. Served over brown rice pasta. Very light and equally good as leftovers the next day!

Excellent recipe. We will make this on a regular basis!!

This was a good basic recipe which I tweaked a bit to give it more spiciness. I actually made this a while back so I don't remember exactly what I added. In any case I really love the lime flavour (we don't get lemons here so I used lime instead). I sauted it in the pan instead of baking it.

sauce was very nice (added some white wine) but who cooks shrimp for 10-15 minutes? came out pretty rubbery. instead of baking, better to quickly saute in sauce on stovetop.

Solid and easy--great weeknight dinner when served over rice.

I gave this recipe a "4" because it was sooo easy and tasted absolutely WONDERFUL!! It was a "quick" night dinner. I had about 1 1/2 lbs of cooked shrimp - so I melted the butter (1/2 stick) and wine (1/2 cup)in the microwave. Then stired in the garlic and parsley. Marinated the shrimp until the rice was done and then cooked it for about 5 min. - Turned the shrimp and sprinkled it with the remaining parsley,zest and lemon juice. Baked it for about 7 minutes. It was to die for!!! You just have to watch the shrimp because it doesn't need to be "cooked", just warmed. Both my husband and son LOVED it!!!

Great basic recipe with endless possibilities. I made an ample serving of the shrimp and served with rice. Had the leftover shrimp + sauce over pasta the next day for lunch. So easy, so simple, so good.

I made this dish for my husband tonight and he liked it. However, I did heed the advice of fellow cooks and added more garlic and cut down on the amount of parsley. My only advice is to drench the white rice(on which I served the shrimp atop)in the remaining garlic-lemon drippings to give it more flavor.

Very simple dish ... good for quick weeknight dinner. Added a few sliced Baby Bella mushrooms to the butter and sauteed before adding garlic, parsley and shrimp. Needed some pepper and also sprinkled on a bit of parmesan for last few minutes. Will definitely add to my "in a hurry" repertoire.

Very easy to make and delicious. Would make again. Would probably cut out some butter and not as much salt.

This is so fast and easy, and really good. I added green onions and also used wine in place of some of the butter as suggested. Served over angel hair pasta. Will definately be making it again.

I did not like this dish at all, but I gave it 2 forks because I changed the recipe a bit. I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of white wine as suggested. My butter was salted so I did not add any more salt. It turned out very bland. Maybe we like shrimp a little more spicy on the Gulf Coast. We added salt and pepper at the table, but it needed something such as green onion, worcestershire, or some other kind of seasoning. I am not an accomplished chef or anything, so maybe I cooked it wrong.

Oh my, oh my, oh my ..... this dish was absolutely fabulous. My boyfriend was a little skeptical because he thinks that shrimp were made for grilling, but this meal made a believer out of him! I also only used 1 stick of butter and instead added 1/2 cup of white wine. I also sprinkled on some red pepper flakes which gave it a nice kick. We had it over rice, but this dish would also be unbelievable served over pasta. I will DEFINITELY be making this over and over again!!!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Simple and easy to make. I added freshly ground pepper and doubled the garlic. Served it over rice and completed the menu with sauteed string beans, salad and plenty of bread to soak up the sauce. Next time I will add white wine in place of some of the butter. Terrific recipe.

My family really liked this recipie. The shrimp were tasty and it was so easy. I also used 1/2 c. of white wine and 1/2 cup butter and dried parsley instead of fresh (didn't have fresh,probably would ve tasted better). I served it with mom's fluffy white rice recipie. Thanks for the suggestions. Would make htis again and again.

As suggested, I used half butter and half white wine. After shrimp had baked, I mixed in cooked spiral shaped pasta, feta cheese and sprinkled with grated parmesan. Then I returned the dish to oven for 5 minutes. Outstanding.

I served this dish to dinner guests one evening. I did not know that one of our guests strongly dislikes seafood. He tried a "bite" to be polite. He ate his serving, had a second helping and asked for the recipe! It is very good.

Wow. Foolproof. Cheap, easy. You really can't mess this one up. I only use 3/4 a stick of butter but add a lot of white wine and put slices of lemon on top (looks nice, hides the fact that I usually use smaller shrimp.) Always a crowd pleaser...

I have served this dish twice to rave reviews. I butterflied the shrimp and substituted chardonnay for 1/2 half of the butter. Since I was serving company I allowed the shrimp to soak in the sauce in the fridge until time to cook. This allowed me to enjoy my guests. Shrimp was recently on sale and I have purchased more and plan to make this dish frequently.

Yes, there is a lot of butter in this dish! But that is why the dish tastes so good. I used less butter, than the reciped called for: just enough to cover the bottom of the baking dish I used, plus a little more to swirl the shrimp in (about 1 1/4 sticks of butter). It worked great. My boyfriend loved it and it was EASY! Use lots of parsley. To make this easier, I suppose you could just add the lemon and zest when adding the garlic. I added frozen peas to my white rice when I put the shrimp into the oven. When the shrimp was ready, so were the peas and the dish looked great!

This was amazing and super easy. I used prawns instead of shrimp and omitted the parsley and it was still great.

Tasty. It cooks fast, so keep your eye on it. Also, don't use substitutions. I used dried parsley instead of fresh, and the flavor suffered.

This recipe was wonderfully easy, with little mess and clean-up. The only think I wasn't thrilled with was how much butter there is! I substituted olive oil for part of the butter, which makes it a teeny bit more heart-healthy, but it's certainly not a dish I'd want to eat frequently...

I made this for 50 people for a church dinner, and everyone loved it. If you buy the shrimp already cleaned it cooks up in no time. I suggest serving it with a green vegetable (I did peas) and rice. The green looks really nice on the plate with the orange shrimp. A very elegant presentation without too much work!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful in it's simplicity. Speaking as a person who spends far too much time at work, I'm always looking for something quick, easy and delicious. This dish meets all of that criteria. It's a good weekday dinner for busy people without much time to plan or cook.

Much better than the similar recipe on this database. I recommend adding a bit more lemon juice if you are using bottled juice and can't get any lemon zest. Delicious and full flavored!
