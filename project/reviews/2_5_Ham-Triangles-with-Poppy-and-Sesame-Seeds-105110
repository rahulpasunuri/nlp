Delicious and pretty--I made for a wedding shower, and they were a hit. One tip--you don't need to butter them--the seeds will adhere to the filling.

A tasty addition to an English tea menu I prepared. As one of a selection of four, it nicely complimented curried eggsalad, smoked salmon, and cucumber sandwiches. I wouldn't make this as the only sandwich to be served

This was terrible. Sandwiches looked cute, but tasted bland. I used an excellent quality ingredients (e.g. I nice smokey ham) but they were still boring.
