I made half this recipe for 4 in a 7-inch springform and it worked perfectly! I took reviewers suggestion and doubled the lemon peel and added 50% more lemon juice. Great refreshing light flavor for cheesecake.

Made this cheesecake with a standard graham cracker crust. Increased the amount of lemon zest to 3T. but kept the amount of juice the same. Results were the perfect lemon taste. I used the water bath method and no cracks occurred. Topped off with sour cream & sugar mixture and returned to oven for 10 minutes. Because it was so creamy I partially froze the remaining half in order to get cleanly cut slices. This cheesecake freezes and defrosts well for last minute dessert.

Made this for a bbq this summer and it was a smashing hit. I went on the generous side of the lemon juice and peel and topped it off with a lemon curd from Trader Joe's. Delish..keep getting requests for the recipe...the crust really makes it pop from other graham wafer crusts.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, but I don't have a food processor so I used a blender for the crust. The cheesecake was creamy and my family loved it.

I made a crust of vanilla wafers and pecans, and topped the cheesecake with lemon curd. People were fighting for the last piece!

I have made this one several times and everyone keeps requesting it. I also double the lemon, and top with lemon curd. I have also made a raspberry sauce to drizzle over the top and garnished with raspberries.

Great! Thanks to the others for reommending the increase in lemon juice and zest, as well as recommending the lemon curd and the blackberry sauce (both on your site). I topped it with the curd and poured the sauce over the slices - a very attractive presentation. One slight problem: On removing the cake from the pan and slicing, the slices crumbled slightly. Any ideas on why? In any case, the curd and sauce covered it all up. Definitely a special-occasion repeater.

My cheesecakes tend to crack unless I use a water bath, so I topped it with lemon curd from this site as suggested by another reviewer. I had also doubled the lemon juice and rind as suggested by many, but if you think something can be too lemony, that was it. The person I made it for loved it, as it had a powerful lemon flavour without being bitter. Next time, I'll make the cake exactly as in the recipe and add the lemon curd topping to cover any cracks and add the zing without needing longer baking time.

I would definitely make this again and again and again. I agree with most other reviews, double the amount of lemon juice and I added more zest too. It will make the lemon taste more pronounce.

I recently made this one for the second time, but I hadn't made the hazelnut crust last time and just wanted to note that it was delicious! I used 2 bars of regular cream cheese and 1 bar of neufchatel, and the flavor and texture were great. But next time I think I'd up the total to 4 bars.

Made with 1/2 cp juice, and graham/gingersnap crust, guests loved it ate it all up. Required about 1hr and a few minutes to finish. Served with a blackberry sauce found on this site, yummy and pretty.

I doubled the lemon zest but used just a bit more juice so as not to change the consistency too much. Also used Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies and no sugar in the crust ( may try gingersnaps next time ). Served it with Raspberry Coulis. This is a lovely cheesecake that really doesn't need any sauce...it can stand on it's own.

Excellent lemon cheesecake. I've made it four times now with these additions: Double the amount of lemon juice & zest. Top baked cheesecake with freshly made lemon curd, (I found a recipie on this web site). Final topping: whip 1/2 pint cream until thick add a little sugar & then fold a small amount of Knox's unflavored gelatin (dissolved) into the cream. You will have many new fans.

This is a fabulous cheesecake if you like rich cheesecake! So rich you can feed a large group because you only want a small slice. I followed other reviewers comments and used 5 packages of regular cream cheese and 2 packages of 1/3 fat. I had too much for my 9" pan so next time I'll leave a package out. I also used 1/2 cup lemon juice in addition to the zest. Yum Yum. I received rave reviews! Just watch for browning in the beginning and cover with foil if necessary. Mine turned slightly brown after 8 minutes so I covered the top with a thin layer of whipped cream and topped with berries when serving. Didn't crack though.

I found this cheesecake to be a little bland, even after doubling the lemon zest and juice. I do not think I will attempt again.

Very tasty, mouthwatering, and smooth cheescake. Very easy to make. (substituted pecans for hazlenuts) Rave reviews from all of my guests....will make this one again!

I took the advice of the other readers and doubled the lemon. And I went one step further by spreading a thin layer of lemon curd on top then garnishing with raspberries and a drizzle of raspberry sauce. All my friends still talk about how this was one of the best cheesecakes they ever had.

I've made this cheesecake a number of times. It's a reliable hit. Seems to taste even better when made with free range eggs. Cake turns out a more golden color too.

This cheesecake is very easy to make and very delicious. I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice juice and 2 T of lemon zest with terrific results. Very lemony. My husband said it tasted better than any cheesecake he had had in a restaurant. A great desert that will impress your guests.

Read other reviews first, so felt comfortable using almonds for the crust. Also substituted a bar of neufchatel cream cheese. Turned out light and tangy. Made it for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it, including me. I'll definitely make it again, especially since it was so simple.

Terrific recipe! I doubled all the lemon ingredients as well to terrific effect. Used toasted pecans in the crust. Needs the overnight chill to set up fully. I cheated so it was softer but still tasted great with silken texture.

Wonderful recipe! As suggested, I doubled the lemon juice and zest. Also, I used toasted macadamia nuts for the crust. To safeguard against cracking, I put a pan of boiling water in the oven when I put the cake in. It turned out perfectly! The taste and texture can't be beat. My boyfriend and I loved it.

I read everyone's reviews before making this. I followed someone's advice and added more lemon zest and lemon juice to make it that much more "lemony". I would definitely make this again, just the way I made it this time.

This was an excellent Cheesecake, However I would read the other reviews and add your own favorite tips to cooking cheesecakes. Such as for this recipe, use a graham crust, add 1 tbl spoon of lemon, 1/4 cup of whipping cream and heaping table spoons of sourcream. This is an excellent recipe.

I have made this cheesecake several times and have not been disappointed. My husband is an expert "crust maker" and has started using walnuts instead of the hazelnuts that the recipe calls for. De-lish!

I have made many cheesecakes and this is by far the lightest. I doubled the lemon juice and zest to give it more flavor. I also made the crust with gingersnaps as another reviewer suggested. The results were amazing. I'm adding this one to my standards.

I've made this delicious cheesecake a couple of times, both special occasions, and it has been a big hit. Quite simple and nice in that you can make it ahead. I like garnishing with fresh strawberries or raspberries--any fresh berry would be nice. A winner especially in spring and summer.

This was the first baked cheesecake I'd ever made, or in fact eaten, so I wasn't 100% sure what to expect. It was easy, came out well, didn't sink or crack and tasted good, but it wasn't *delicious*. Quite a gentle lemon flavour. Guests really liked it, but I was less convinced it was worth it, somehow. It had a slightly granular texture, especially compared to my mum's no-bake, gelatin set cheesecakes; is this right for this kind of cheesecake, or is it my error? Didn't have enough crust mixture to make a 'wall' for the cheesecake, so put it all on the base. I also made a strawberry coulis to go with it; it was a refreshingly low-fat accompaniment to such a lard-fest as this cheesecake, looked desperately pretty, and complimented the lemon-hazelnut flavour rather well. I would make it again, but I will experiment with other recipes, too.

This was a hit yesterday at Sunday dinner. Everyone enjoyed it and it was extremely easy to make. I didn't have any hazelnuts, so I made the crust with vanilla wafers and butter. I also topped with a thin layer of lemon curd....Fabulous.

I made a macadamia nut crust instead and this was fabulous. Just the thing to top off dinner. My guests were impressed with the results.

Delicious!!! I made a topping as my centre sunk in. 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup double cream and 1 cup chopped hazelnuts mixed together on the stovetop. Result a lovely caramel which I cooled and poured on top of cake . Cooled. It definitely added to the overall dish. I was pleased and my guests delighted..

I used pecans instead of hazelnuts and topped it with lemon curd folded into sweetened whipping cream. It got rave reviews at a dinner party. Light and creamy but not overly rich with bright lemon flavor. A winner.

Yummy! I used pecans instead of hazelnuts because I didn't have any hazelnuts on hand, and they were excellent in the crust. I also covered the top of the cheesecake with homemade candied lemon slices--beautiful AND delicious! A worthwhile recipe for anyone who loves lemons and cheesecakes.

Superb! I've made it twice - once for a special occasion and the second time just for us! My 4-year-old loves it! Very creamy. I made the crust with walnuts both times. It must be out of this world with hazelnuts b/c it was great with walnuts. Keep an eye on it in the oven around the time that it should be finished. It was perfect both times!

I made this cheesecake twice and had to extend the baking time 20 minutes. It is wonderful.

I've already made it several times. My changes to the recipe include making the crust with gingersnaps, which I highly recommend (I can't resist the ginger-lemon combination) and making it as a lime cheesecake instead (still good, but not sensational) I haven't found the need to bake it for longer. Maybe my oven is fast.

This is a wonderful light (not low calorie) desert. I've made it twice. The only change I would make is to extend the cooking time an additional 10 to 15 minutes which I did the second time I made it.

Excellent cheesecake with a great crust. Crust would be a good foundation for a Key Lime Pie recipe
