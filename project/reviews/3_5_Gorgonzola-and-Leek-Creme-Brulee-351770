This was delicious. I made it for a gourmet Valentines Day dinner, and it was a hit. I didn't have a hand-held blowtorch though, but I placed it on the top rack of my oven that was on high broil. Be careful not to overcook the parmesan though, because there it is critical to take it out the short moment between undercooked, and burned, when it is just right

We always want to cook the best and the healthiest recipe that we can find from the internet. As a mother, I always want that and in able to keep up with those needs, I need to be focused and be creative. I always have Gourmandia. Com on my side to give me the appropriate recipes for the day and for me not to reiterate the recipe that I did the other day! Its just so innovative!

Incredible!! Served with a big fat ribeye. Easy to make but tastes very impressive. I used the dill and parmesan. One thing to note, I think the 275 oven was too slow. I baked at 325 and turned out beautifully. A keeper!
