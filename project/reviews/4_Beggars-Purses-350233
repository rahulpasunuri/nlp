Our dinner group had this along with the whole "living legends" menu. It was wonderful but hardly for beggars given the cost of the caviar. We think that smoked salmon may be a more affordable alternative, but the orignal is a real treat. Gorgeous too!

I will give these four forks to be give them a chance since 5 people posted reviews and none have tried the recipe. If anyone tries this recipe, please post your results. Thanks.

I plan to make these this week and will double the receipe. I must say, I am always amazed at some of the unexpected comments/reviews and find them to be entertaining. I often share those comments with my fellow cooks for a good laugh.

I have to agree with A Cook from Wayne, NJ. I haven't tried this recipe but some of these reviews are obviously from people who don't have a clue about cooking but think they're in a chat room. 4 ounces of salt for caviar?!!! Sour milk instead of sour cream????!!!! Epicurious editors should feel justified in printing only those reviews that actually make some culinary sense and have to do with the recipe. Please spare us from some of these! They are simply too painful to endure.
