This was good but much sweeter than I expected. Still tasted delicious over vanilla ice cream. Would taste even better over plain-tart frozen yogurt to cut some of the sweetness.

Caramel overwhelms blueberry flavor. Even though I cut down the sugar, it was too sweet. Wouldn't make again.

Yes blueberries are sweet, but how do you expect to make a caramel sauce without sugar? Easy to make and tastes delicious. Made it to serve on Tres Leches Cake for a Mexican dinner. Should be able to make this sauce with any berry in season.

You are kidding. 1.5 cups of sugar added to what is already one of the sweetest fruits - and this is listed as "healthy"?
