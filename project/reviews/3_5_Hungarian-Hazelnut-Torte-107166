I first made this cake several years ago for a party, and it was a huge hit. I make it occasionally for special occasions. It requires a little bit of patience, or the cake can become flat and lifeless. I brush the cake with frangelico or chambord and fill with raspberry instead of apricot.

I love classic Viennese style cakes and enjoyed this one. I had never made buttercream before and found this process quite easy to do (I usually find pastry cream frustrating). I left out 1/3 of the sugar throughout and the sweetness was just right for me. The overall flavor is light and delicate. I decided to slice the cake into three layers and fill with a little whipped cream (barely sweetened) to help balance the heavier buttercream.

Very "old european" type dessert. Classic standard that is fairly easy to make and looks great on the table. Serve with whipped cream topped turkish coffee.

This is as close to the recipe passed down in my family from my Magyar (Hungarian) great grandmother!

OK but not great. Flavor one-dimensional: overpowering hazelnut. Lacks complexity of typical Central European tortes. Apricot preserves not enough. Would retry with the following modifications: two layers of apricot preserves, lemon added to apricot preserves for more tartness, brandy or GRand Marnier added to buttercream.

It seemed like it took forever for me to make this cake and it was surprisingly disappointing when I tasted it. The cake was dry and the frosting was very soft (almost runny). I've made sure that I threw my copy of this recipe away so that I won't mistakenly make it again.

Time-consuming, but definitely worth it. This is hazelnut cake at its hazelnuttiest best.

my brother-in-law lives in budapest and gave us a bottle of Tokay dessert wine, as mentioned in the article about this torte. i made it for a lunch party and served it and the wine as dessert. my husband, who is not particularly generous with praise, called the combination "exquisite". now i have to get more of that wine!

It was certainly a beautiful presentation. When we cut into it we were dissapointed as it was just so-so. For the time it took to make it should have been a whole lot better. With so many other tortes available to make I'll pass on this one again

I made this for my mother's gourmet group and received rave reviews. They couldn't even save a piece for the chef - it was that good. It is time consuming, but the results are beautiful and delicious. A definite keeper!

Excellent torte, although it is somewhat time consuming to make, it is well worth the effort. I made it for my German father-in-law who loves European baking and he raved about it. I wouldn't change a thing - but you have to love hazelnuts as the flavor is very strong.
