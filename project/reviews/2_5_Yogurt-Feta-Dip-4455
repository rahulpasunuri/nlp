I would agree with another reviewer that the quality of ingredients makes or breaks this recipe. I used nonfat Greek yogurt, fresh feta, salt and pepper and minced fresh mint and parsley. It was served with grilled potatoes and chicken and was quite good.

Even with added salt, pepper, and cayenne it's pretty bland. I don't know what would improve it.

I agree, it wasn't salty enough. Actually, it was kind of bland. I ended up "doctoring" it with some pepper and hot sauce too. Okay, but I like the ricotta spread I came up with better.

How did you serve this dip...it looks good, but with what?

Maybe it's just me, but even with extra feta, I didn't find this salty enough! I sprinkled a little sea salt in, then added a just a little extra virgin olive oil. Turned out great! Excellent with fried sweet potatoes and am going to try it with fish sometime soon.

This recipe is definitely an expression of the goodness of the individual ingredients. I used greek yogurt (thick and yummy in and of itself) and greek feta, and minced the green onions very finely and then mixed everything together by hand. The dip was wonderful. A real keeper, and so super fast and easy to make. If I couldn't get greek yogurt, I think I would drain regular whole milk yogurt. Look for good artisnal feta--it will make a real difference.

I used black peppercorn feta, which added an extra dimension that I liked. However, this dip is a bit too salty and next time I'll probably reduce the amount of cheese and drain the yogurt a bit so that it's thicker.

To reply to the posted comment... you can usually find whole milk yogurt in a healthfood store. I've also started to see it more often in the supermarket because Pediatricians recommend it for babies so it's becoming a little more mainstream.

I could not find plain yogurt that was not non-fat or low fat. The recipe turned out runny. Also, the feta cheese seems awfully salty. Still, I would try it again if I could find the right yogurt.
