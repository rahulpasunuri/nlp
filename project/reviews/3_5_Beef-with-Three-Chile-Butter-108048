This sauce is perfect. I would put it on anything. It always impresses. I also found it very easy to make.

This is great. It's got a bit of labor so I use when I'm trying to impress, and it works! I always end up with extra sauce too.

I did not like the chile butter at all. My husband and I love spicy dishes and this was spicy but the flavor just wasn't good.

You can't easily go wrong with such a beautiful cut of meat, and I think that it's the real star of this recipe. I have mixed feelings about the chile butter. The strips of chile are surely edible, but they don't *look* edible. I recommend either cutting up the chiles into very small pieces (lots of work) or throwing the whole mix into a blender or food processor to make a puree after it's cooked. The butter is tasty to me, but be sure your guests like spiciness before you dump the butter all over their meat.

Fantastic. Made exactly as written, and will again!

Deliciosa, lo unico que hice diferente fue licuar la salsa, y la verdad creo que queda mejor de ese modo!!

This recipe was excellent! The only thing I did differently was blend the chile-butter sauce. I'll definitely make this again.
