It was just an OK cake, a little dry.

Unique flavor, blends well with Middle Eastern fare, but it's versatile enough to be served with other food as well. Given what others had said about its being flat, I doubled the recipe and baked in the same 13x9x2 pan for 50 minutes, and it was perfect; it was dense but completely cooked through. I took the advice to lower the sugar, so in the double recipe I used 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2 cups. The cake was perfect to me before the glaze. With the glaze it was over-sweet but I am not a glaze fan. I made a single recipe of the glaze for the double recipe since the surface area to cover was the same. If I make it again, I'd double the cake and halve the glaze - or skip it altogether. As for color, I added about 3 drops of blue and 12 drops of red and it came out the color of a whole wheat loaf.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I make it in a bundt pan and turn it over onto a glass cake plate with lid ~ it's all in the presentation. The cake looks as beautiful as it tastes! I have made it several times and have always gotten rave reviews.

I would not recommend this cake. It's tasteless even though I added extra lime zest, needs to be baked more than the recipe states and doesn't present well. Plus it has a LOT of sugar.

Great tasting cake. It is very low in height, as others have mentioned. The pomegranate juice and lime zest combine to give it a rather unattractive color though. Even the glaze didn't help. Next time I would add a drop of red color, to help it look as good as it tastes.

I was tasked with bringing a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean dessert to a party and was entirely at a loss. I stumbled on this and WOW. Not only is it incredibly easy (especially if you can find pomegranate seeds already husked), it's as beautiful in presentation as it is unusual. Very moist. I'd cut down on the amount of powdered sugar in the glaze - almost too sweet. I also accidentally shortchanged the amount of sugar in the batter by 1/3 of a cup and it didn't matter.

I thought this cake was delicious, and I did not have any problems with the texture as others did.

I made the cake for a pot luck. Instead of making the cake from scratch, I used a white cake mix. I followed the directions on the box with regard to the eggs and oil but substituted pomegranate juice for the water and added the yogurt. It turned out beautiful and fluffy. Be sure you bake it long enough. The glaze was wonderful when it seeped down into the cake and the lime zest, polmeranate seeds and mint made a beautiful holiday presentation. I am taking it for Thanksgiving.

If I could rate zero forks, I would. This was just awful. I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was OK, but the texture was like wet fudge. Also, the cake was very thin/flat. Regarding presentation: it looked like pasty, dead flesh with the lime looking like squiggly little worms.

Although this cake is a very flat cake it was delicious! I put the glaze on when it came out of the oven and did not poke holes in the cake as it seemed very porous. I then read that it was suppose to cool 15 minutes. Oops! It did not look great until I cut it into squares and put it on a clear dessert plate. Wow! It came to life and looked beautiful with the pomegrantes on top. I served it to my guests with gelato and it was a huge success. I would definitely do it again. A perfect finish to a lovely meal.

had terrible time with this recipe. the batter looked so flat when i put it in the pan so i made sure to take it out early (toothpick came out clean). however, after 5 minutes, i had a gooey underbaked mess. stuck it back in the oven--big mistake. went ahead and made the glaze. the cake tasted nice, the glaze was interesting but it was a flattened undercooked soppy mess. partly my fault for taking it out too soon, partly just an unworkable recipe. also, the lime peel in both the cake & the glaze was a little overwhelming. don't know whether i'll try again, even though i have leftover pomegranate seeds & plenty of juice.

Fantastic cake - super easy to make yet exotic taste. The pom. seeds and mint/lime finishes make it so beautiful and colorful. Definitely will make this again.

I saw this recipe in my new Bon Appetit, and couldn't wait to try it. The batter was incredibly tasty, but the cake itself was a gooey awful consistency. Ended up throwing the cake and recipe away. The glaze was very good, and I'll save that recipe for a different kind of cake.
