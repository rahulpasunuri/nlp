This recipe was satisfying & good but nothing exiting, as most roasted veggies are. This was my first time cooking/eating kohlrabi the flavor is hard to describe. To me it's mild & reminds me a little bit of a celery like flavor. After roasting it has a very soft texture and browns very nicely coated with the olive oil in the oven.

Very tasty, very easy and I added the pieces of onion that another cook suggested.

Had garden fresh kohlrabi and cooked it per directions. It does take a full 30 minutes and make sure you cut it into the correct dice or it will not be done at the same time. I think it could use some roasted onions or other root veggies roasted with it to add flavor. Not something I would seek out.........
