This is a relatively easy (labor-intensive, but easy) Trifle recipe that is certain to REALLY please all of your guests. It makes a beautiful presentation, is a bit decadent (as expected), and a great end to a formal or casual but elegant dinner. My local gourmet food store was out of champagne biscuits, so I tried shortbread to substitute on short notice (bad idea; they're too dense, IMO). One thing I DID do the second time I made this was to drizzle Godiva over the biscuits and let them saturate in the frig overnight - this truly elevated the recipe from very good to GREAT, and I received many fantastic compliments. It also balances the raspberry flavors without diluting them. This might also work well with Amaretto liqueur - that's what I will try next. Great trifle variation! Tip: Use the very best white chocolate you can find - the percentage of cacao and white cocoa butter will make or break this dish. Read the ingredient detail info on the back of the bars.

Annual favourite -- impressive presentation for guests, absolutely delicious, and easy to make! The only change I make is to substitute the simple syrup with Creme de Cassis (black currant liqueur). You could dip the Savoiardis in any fruit liqueur you like -- adds another layer of flavour.

Made this again for our annual Christmas gathering. You can't go wrong with this-it's a killer. Easy and quick to make, a little costly, but well worth it. It looks so good people are hesitant to start digging into it. Made recipe exactly as written.

Made for Christmas with my 15- year old budding baker son. Came out great. My BBS thought of adding shaved white chocolate for the top which made it extra special. My addition was a adding a bit of Chambord to the cookies along with syrup. A yummy holiday keeper!

This is a very delicious and easy dessert. I used a pound cake and amaretto (instead of almond extract) which worked out well. I found that it tasted better after sitting in the fridge overnight. Would definately recommend this recipe.

I have made this 3 times now and it was a hit everytime. Watch out not to overwhip the cream and make a day ahead, it comes out better when it sits overnight. I also use a 10 ounce bag of Ghiradelli chocolate but only fold in about 80% of it to keep the cream fluffier.

We enjoyed this recipe; it had a great flavor. It makes a lot of the white chocolate/cream, and I ended up not using all of it. Next time I'll increase the number of ladyfingers to give it a little more substance. The almond/raspberry combo is very nice.

This dessert is super easy and looks great. A few changes I made: I used angel food cake, and instead of dipping it, I drizzled it with orange juice (didn't want the cake too soggy) Other than that, I followed the recipe, and it was really good!

I've made this a few times and it never disappoints! Its perfect for the holidays or anytime you are serving a heavy meal. For what its worth, I've always been able to find Madeline's at Safeway. However I would like to solicit some advice. Every time I make it I am unable to keep the fluffiness of the whipped cream. How long is everyone waiting for the chocolate to cool before folding? Mine always seems to keep the fluffiness until the very last bit of chocolate that I add and then it becomes a little soupy. To overcome this I've separated one cup of whipped cream to add just in case. Appreciate any advice.

Absolutely yummy desert and fun to make. I combined this with another recipe on epi called mixed berries with mascoporne and limoncello. I left out the white chocolate and almonds. Instead I whipped fresh cream with some mascoporne, added some limoncello and sugar. No lady fingers used, replaced with pound cake drizzled with the limoncello-sugar water mix. Layered this just like the recipe called for, with some jam in between, topped with fresh berries. Made a day in advance for the alcohol to really soak in. Very pretty and relish served in glasses.

I made some adjustments but got rave reviews on this recipe. I made individual servings in tall glasses and halved the recipe. I had a nut allergy to deal with so eliminated the almond extract and substituted limoncello for the sugar syrup. I used all fresh raspberries in place of the frozen and marinated 1/2 of them in sugar and limoncello. There wasn't much lemon flavour. The presentation was a little messy but very well received. Crisp ladyfingers remained firm with a pound cake texture once it was served. I did sprinkle the toasted almonds on top for those who could eat them. Delicious.

This is the absolute best holiday dessert in the world. Tomorrow will be the third Easter I've served it (making it now), and I've never changed a thing. The crisp ladyfingers weren't that easy to find, but I finally tracked them at an Italian food store. I don't have a trifle dish, so I serve it a large glass bowl. Having a make-a- day-in-advance knock-out dessert for a holiday is such a beautiful thing!

I made this for New Years and everyone loved it! Beautiful to look at and delicious. I halved the recipe and served it in a large champagne glass. I also used the Chambord in place of the syrup and added Amaretto in place of almond extract. Used Ghiradelli white chocolate. Will make this again!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe but feel compelled to do so as it was an absolute hit at my family Christmas party. I plan on making it again for a New Years party I will be hosting. I did follow the recipe for the most part but did make some alterations as suggested by other reviewers. I am not a fan of soaked lady fingers which tend to end up mushy and had an impossible time finding Boudoirs or Champagne biscuits. I substituted pound cake instead and it worked out well. I did use the almond extract in the whipped cream mixture which others omitted but I am a fan of almond extract in the right dessert (and this is one of them). Also I saved the step of soaking pound cake in sugar/water/extract mix and opted (as others did) to soak the pound cake in Chambord, which was a fantastic alternative!! Would recommend this anyone as it is the absolutely delicious and not at all time consuming or complex. Enjoy!!!

This is one of the most delicious and easy recipes I have ever made. Prepared it for Christmas lunch. We were 8 people and I was worried that I would have too much left over as it states the quantity is for 16. Well, most of the trifle got eaten up! People were clamouring for more. I could not find raspberries, so used blue berries and blueberry jam. Delicious!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party last year and although it sat for the first hour, once word got out, it was gone in a flash. Barely a crumb remained. It was easy and fast to make, beautiful presentation, which trifles always are, and the flavors were spot on. Quite sweet with the jam and everything, but still no complaints. It is a dessert afterall. I could not find the champagne biscuits and used soft ladyfingers since that was all I could find. I did a very quick dip in the soaking liquid, but even that was not necessary. The ladyfingers pretty much dissolved in the trifle. Still quite delicious and I will make again for sure. Next time, I may try pound cake as I still don't know where to find those biscuits.

Rating: 4
This trifle is easy, impressive-looking, AND delicious -- that's a difficult combination to beat! I followed the recipe as written, but next time I might skip the sugar/water dipping phase as the ladyfingers I used were plenty moist from being topped with the melted jam. I'd also like to try it with pound cake instead of the ladyfingers. Do NOT skip the toasted sliced almonds -- they lend a wonderful crunchy texture to this otherwise super creamy dessert. This one would be great for a holiday party as well!

This is an amazing recipe. I have made it twice this holiday season and received rave reviews (more in the way of oohs and ahhs) both times. I too added the custard as an additional layer and also dipped the ladyfingers in chambord. I used unsweetened frozend raspberries which worked perfectly. Yummy and very easy to make.

I elimintaed the almond from this recipe. Used raspberry liquor in the whip cream/white chocolate mixture as well as in the lady finger dipping liquid - to which I also added the juice from the frozen sweetened raspberries instead of the sugar and water combo. Instead of fresh raspberries which are so expansive and unflavourful at this time of year, I used flash frozen raspberries - perfect. I topped the trifle with whip cream falvoured with the raspberry liquor and shaved dark chocolate. Beautiful.

Rating: 1
I added Chambord which gave the dessert some character. I also used 4 bars of Lindt white and probably could have just used Jello pudding with little sacrifice in taste or texture. Sorry, guests liked it but I thought it very SoCal Blonde- pretty to behold but utterly boring.

This was fabulous! I could not find lady fingers, so I substituted pound cake instead. It was a hit and everyone oohed and ahhed over the presentation.

Maybe I did something wrong, but next time I would buy more frozen raspberries and more than 1 cup of jam. Can't wait to make this again!

Delicious and so easy. Since the recipe first printed, I have made it for almost every special occasion...my son requests it instead of a traditional birthday cake. Just a note, for the people who say the ladyfingers disappeared, are you sure you are using the crisp ladyfingers? The boudoirs can be hard to find as another reviewer mentioned. They are also called savioridis which I have found in the Italian specialty section at Mollie Stones or Whole Foods. Trader Joes has a ladyfinger that is crisp, too. The soft ladyfingers are so delicate, they do seem to melt!

Yummm!! I made this for Mother's Day and got rave reviews. An extremely easy recipe that looks like you slaved over it. I will definitely make it again. As per the suggestions of other reviews I made the following changes: doubled the amount of almond extract in the whipping cream, used Sara Lee pound cake dipped in both sugar water then chambord, layered vanilla custard after the jam, soaked frozen sweetened raspberries in 1/4 cup chambord.

This is the best trifle I have ever made or eaten. It may even be the best dessert I have ever made or eaten. Raspberries may be pricey, but you really get your money's worth with this recipe! And to top it all off, it's quite easy to make. Try it-- you'll love it!

I made this trifle over the weekend and it was a hit. I was told the recipe was a keeper before my guests finished their servings! I did make some adjustments based on reading the reviews here. 1) I added more almond extract to the whipped cream prior to folding in the white chocolate.2) I wasn't able to find any lady fingers so I used Langues de Chat cookies, which were okay for the serving 5 hours later, but disintegrated overnight. 3) I used premade custard after the jam layer. 4) I used frozen raspberries (Europe's Best) since the fresh ones were so expensive ($4.99 for a half-pint) and my guests raved about the raspberries. 5) I whipped the whipped cream stiffer than recommended, which worked well when the chocolate sauce was folded in. I used Lindt white chocolate which was wonderful.

Rating: 3
Very impressive to bring to the table in Christmas day. I folded vanilla custard through the chocolate cream as trifle without custard is just not right!!! Used a mixture of hard amaretto biscuits as well as ladyfingers instead of adding almond essence to the cream and left out the raspberry jam altogether. The toasted almonds were great.

Everyone loved it, but somehow the ladyfingers disappeared by the time I served the dessert! (I assembled it the night before) No one knew, but it was like the disintegrated or something. I would use angel food or pound cake next time.

I've made this a couple of times and each with great reviews! One thing that I found helpful the second time around was to beat the cream until there were stiff peaks. I also beat the cream a little more once I added the chocolate mixture to keep some of the fluffiness.

This is my new favorite dessert! I am making it for Christmas dinner. I did a trial run of it two weeks ago and everyone raved about it. I left out all the almond flavoring and almonds and instead soaked the rasberries in rasberry liquour as someone suggested and added it to the chocolate whipped cream. Very light, so it's perfect after a heavy meal. Although a bit summery, it's very festive and refreshing in the winter.

I made this exactly as instructed for a Christmas dinner party at our home. As soon as the first 2 people took a bite out of it they said, "what is this?" It was a great dessert that fit the holiday season. This recipe replaces the Strawberry Cheesecake Trifle as the all-time favorite trifle at our house. Great dessert, and great looking as well.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have made it for Christmas the past 2 years since I found it in Bon Appetit. Only made a few changes; I omitted the almonds, we tried it the first time and didnt like the crunch, and we used bittersweet chocolate instead of white. We also added some blackberries with the respberries and and used Nilla Wafers instead of lady fingers. The dont get as soggy and they have a better texture I found

I was excited to try out this recipe because trifle is a favorite of mine. I made this for a dessert party and it was the hit of the party. I've made it many times since then, and it always turns out delicious. I used angel food cake cut up into cubes instead of the ladyfingers and it worked as a great substitute. If you want to impress guests with a delicious and easy to make dessert, this is your dessert.

It's a "five fork" dessert. I am making it again this week. Did not use almond extract. Used 4 pkg. fresh raspberries and raspberry liqueur (Chambord) in the dipping sauce and mascerated the raspberries. Used Sara Lee pound cake, toasted, (couldn't find hard ladyfingers) Good chocolate is important. I wouldn't use anything, but the best ingredients in this recipe. Served with prime rib roast for 8 guests.

I am in the minority here, but I didn't love this recipe, though my guests were very happy with it. I found it overly sweet and not very interesting, and I prefer trifle with egg custard rather than just the whipped cream and white chocolate used here. Some of the suggestions from other reviewers would probably improve this dessert (adding raspberry liqueur or brandy, for example). But I make a lot of desserts, and this one is not a keeper for me.

I made this for Christmas and it was so tasty, everyone loved it. I liked it so much because it was a light and full of delicious raspberries and white chocolate. YUM!

It added another dimension to the desert. Super!

This was 100% delicious - we all went crazy over it!! And it looked beautiful, too. I only had an 8-cup trifle dish, and it still worked (although filled to the gills!) I will make this EVERY year! (I did add a teeny bit more almond extract as per other reviewers).
