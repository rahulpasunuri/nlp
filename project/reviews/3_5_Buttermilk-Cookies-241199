One of my favorites. I particularly like the texture, and they have just the right amount of lemon. I usually make these instead of sugar cookies. For a fun variation, add 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds.

The taste of the cookie was great....not too sweet. I did not flatten the first batch, because I expected the cookies to spread out as they baked. I ended up with cake-like cookie balls. I flattened the second batch before baking, which helped. I actually piped the third batch onto the cookie sheet. Overall, I enjoyed the taste much more than the texture. I will experiment a bit with the recipe next time....

Two forks means "good," and that is all these were. They are basically an old-fashioned, cakelike sugar cookie. I didn't have problems with the dough being too dry, it is possible that the people who experienced that did not measure the flour correctly. At any rate, these were very cute when finished. The glaze is as others have said, very sweet and one-dimensional... I added the juice of half a lemon for some zing.

This is the first cookie I liked enough to bother joining the group so I could write a review. The thing I like about the cookie is how adaptable it is. I make a double batch - then before adding the flavoring - I divide into four smaller bowls and add different flavoring. Then I have a nice platter of cookies for events with different cookies for different tastes. My favorite is maple extract in both the cookie and the frosting. It's like a minnie maple bar without being oversweet and sticky. I also like the original lemon flavoring, or almond extract, orange extract w/mini chocolate chips,and peppermint extract. Not everything I've tried worked, but it was fun to play around with.

Like other reviewers, I made these to put leftover buttermilk to good use. I'd say they are mediocre. They are adequate for what I made them for- to bring to a community center social event. I followed the recipe exactly but did not put any icing on the cookies based on other people's comments & that I usually find confectioner's based icing way too sweet. The lemon gives them a nice flavor beyond the otherwise buttery taste. Mine came out kind of dry no matter how much I played with the baking time. I'll probably fish around for a different recipe next time I have buttermilk to use up.

These cookies are disgusting. Completely tasteless. DO NOT waste your time.

I used this recipe to get rid of leftover buttermilk and fell in love with it. I do not have that big of a sweet tooth, so I make smaller cookies. Instead of a Tblsp of dough, I use a tsp. They make great cookie bites that are a perfect snack. The only issue is it makes a TON of them so be prepared to bring some to work or send some home with friends.

1st time making these and I will totally make them again as well as recommend the recipe to friends. My only changes were I used 1c white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar; I chilled the dough overnight. They baked up nice and puffy with a crisp bottom. Next time I might make them into sandwiches with a lemon creme filling.

Like other reviewers, I had buttermilk to use up-these are okay-I flatten them a bit like others suggested to get them brown. Seem bland without the icing and too sweet withit-maybe add more buttermilk so it is not saw thick.

Perfect cookies if you don't have a big sweet tooth (like me)! I found them to be almost addictive, so I don't make them too often, or I will end up eating the entire batch myself. I also found that they tasted ever better after a couple of days in an airtight container. They get a bit tougher, but are still yummy!

these are soooo good... skip the icing though. A perfect, simple, tangy and super delicious cookie to have with tea or even espresso in the afternoon, or wit a glass of milk while they're warm out of the oven. Also this recipe makes more than enough to fill the cookie jar (if you can resist scooping the dough out of the bowl..). Highly recommend.

I had leftover buttermilk to use up, but I hate making cookies because due to the uneven heating in my cruddy oven, I have to rotate my cookie sheets every few minutes. However, if I make bars in a square tin, I can set a rotating tray in the oven and just let it go. So I turned these into a bar, which worked out GREAT because the light, cakey texture. I only used 2.5 cups of flour, added an extra tsp of vanilla, and didn't use any lemon zest. Instead, I chopped up about a cup of dried apricots and a little under a cup of sliced and finely chopped almonds. The almond and apricot complimented the sweetness of the recipe wonderfully. They came out moist and delicious, and have been a huge hit. I didn't make the glaze.

I made this recipe as a way to use up some of my leftover buttermilk. It was not quite what I expected. The cookies were much more cake-like and less crisp on the outer edges than I wanted. Next time, I'd flatten them up more on the cookie sheet. The glaze did not add much to the taste...maybe I'd use orange juice or lemon juice instead of the buttermilk next time. The good thing is they're EASY!

A very nice soft cookie. Easy to make. I found that working with the stand mixer instead of the hand mixer, much easier for me. I doubled the amount of lemon zest, however. Delicious.

These cookies are a good way to use up buttermilk left over from other recipes, but I wouldn't go buy buttermilk for the purpose of making them.

Rating: 3
Different cookie texture; almost cake-like, but with just enough crispness on the edge. I kept cookie dough recipe the same, but replaced meyer lemon extract for the vanilla in the glaze. After glazing cookies, I sprinkled tops with lemon zest and fresh thyme leaves. I think the zest and thyme added a little more complex flavor to a simple (albeit delicious) cookie. Using the lemon extract in the glaze cuts that "powdery" taste of the sugar.

These cookies were wonderful I substituted lime zest in the flour mixture and also lime juice and zest along with the buttermilk in the glaze. It looked so pretty with the bright green flecks of zest and very tasty.

Light and delicious, my mom said best cookie she'd ever tasted. We tried adding chocolate chips to part of the batter and choc chips & walnuts to another part, but the recipe is much better as is. (Chocolate and nuts too overpowering for such a delicate underlying taste).

These were amazing!!! All the reviews were right on...except the lady that didn't think they were worth it, I'm not sure she made them right! My fiance liked them so much, we are making another batch after 3 days! Neighbors also gave rave reviews. FYI for high altitude cookers, 12 min is the max you want to cook these.

I made these with almond extract in place of the vanilla in the cookies and I added about two cups of coconut. They are very good this way.

Terrific recipe. To get better lemon flavor, replace the vanilla with 1/2 t lemon extract and 1/2 t. orange extract. Use only orange in glaze. I separated glaze into three parts and dyed one red, one blue, left one as is. Made a great July 4th potluck offering. They were eaten so quickly!

I halved this recipe and didn't use lemon zest...I used 1 tbs grated ginger and then threw in some chocolate chunks. Yes, I know that I completely changed it. But the cookie base, that soft, gooey cookie, is EXCEPTIONAL. This is my new go to recipe for a cookie to play with. Yesterday I made them again but with white chocolate chips and salted peanuts. Absolutely divine.

Wow. I only add one cookie recipe to my binder once every year or two, so any recipe that makes the cut offers something original and delicious. This cookie fits both those descriptions. The buttermilk and lemon gave the cookie just enough acid to counteract the sugar. I added some lemon verbena (maybe 2T chopped) with the wet ingredients and was very pleased with the result!

Rating: 4
soooo delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written (oops, not exactly - I added about a tspn of lemon zest to the icing). It was light, fluffy, still a little crispy. I'll absolutely be making this again. I read a lot of reviews that said they were cake or scone- like, but I thought they were very cookie-like. :) Was pleasantly surprised and will be adding this to my recipe box.

These were really yummy, though I must agree that it is not quite right to call them cookies. There is actually a real "cakie" like this in Germany, though, which, ironically enough are called "Amerikaner", so Americans :) I decided to make these when I asked a friend to bring buttermilk for the pancakes I was making for breakfast and she brought twice the amount I needed. I added lots of extra lemon to bring out that flavor, which worked out nicely. I added a big sqeeze of lemon juice to the batter and put a little juice and lemon zest in the icing. They were reeally yummy. All my friends (even one particularly picky eater) really loved them. They were gone in two days, which is too bad, because they are the kind of cookie that get better in taste before getting icky. I will definetely make these again!

These are a hybrid of cookie, cupcake and scone... in terms of its texture. Flavour is good - lightly sweet, can't taste the lemon. Although good, these are nothing special. Wouldn't serve to guests. Nice with a cup of tea though.

These were a hit both at home and at work. I was too tired to do the glaze so I shortcutted to sprinkling powdered sugar on the cookie and the were fabulous. The texture was incredible and fluffy as described by so many previous posters. Everyone commented on the touch of lemon flavoring and I loved the lemon scent during the mixing process. I may have used more lemon zest then the recipe called for (1 lemon zested). I plan to do these again and step up my recipe to improve the appearance.

These were delicious - had a nice cake-like texture with crispy edges. After reading the reviews, I decided to add more flavor and substituted the zest from one medium orange for the lemon zest called for in the recipe. I also added 1 tsp of orange zest to the glaze.

We have decided to call these cakies instead of cookies. A wonderful recipe but certainly more like a tea cake in structure. I added a dash of almond extract to play on the lemon zest which yielded a lovely citrus/nutty flavor. Certainly a nice alternative to standard crunchy or chewy cookies, my family loved them.

These cookies would be lovely served as part of a high tea. They are mellow and fluffy. But if you are looking to make cookies as a treat for family or friends this is not your recipe. They are just rather dull and don't stand on their own.

I rated these cookies only two forks because they did not keep overnight. They were delicious out of the oven and for the first day. The next day they were a flavorless limp mess. If you make these, plan to eat them quickly.

quick and easy. my favorite way to make these is add 2 sliced rasberries on top (while glaze is still wet) to give a sweet/tart balance.

I suspect Miss Lewis was referring to her tea cakes when she spoke of buttermilk cookies. Her recipe, which is included in the cookbook she did with Scott Peacock, is divine.

Tried baking the cookies with and without parchment and they were delicately crisp around the edges without the parchment and still very soft. Those baked with the parchment were very soft. Divine and delicate, my co- workers are still thanking me for them after eating them 3 days ago.

This is a nice old fashioned drop type cookie. I increased the lemon zest and really liked the flavor. They taste a lot like madeleines-but with icing! The appearance is the only thing lacking. Not very seductive on the plate.

I just made these cookies, and I really like them! They remind me a lot of the tops off cupcakes. After reading other bakers' reviews, I used extra lemon zest (most of the zest from a pretty large lemon) and they came out with a delicious lemony flavor.

I loved this cookies! They are classic southern treats! I found that using home made lemon curd was a great way to pump up the lemon flavor by using that instead of a glaze. make these cookies often and everyone always likes them!

Personally I wasn't impressed with these...but 3 weeks after making them (and sending them to my husbands' work) he's getting requests for them. Go figure! I think I'd like them with a more pronounced lemon punch - which perhaps increasing the zest will do next time!

In general, I prefer cookies with some form of chocolate but these cookies were absolutely divine. I made them for my ladies poker night and everyone complimented me on them. Two things though: make sure the cookies are very cool before stacking as they will stick to each other and also, they are fine the second day (or even the third) just be sure to wrap them tightly or store them in a sealed container.

The texture is the highlight of these cookies. They were perfect - with a crispness around the perimeter and light and soft inside. The flavor was pretty good. (Since I'm not a huge fan of the sugar cookie family, my lackluster response is par for the course.) The glaze didn't work well for me. It looked pretty on top of the cookies, but it was just too sweet. For me, it didn't bring anything to the party except the harsh, overly sweet taste of confectioner's sugar - which isn't needed here.

They are wonderful. Even my business partner's little girl who does not like anything loved them. I would add more lemon zest.

i got rave reviews for these cookies! so i made them 2 days in a row! my husband and i shared one to taste and we both thought they were great. fun to make, easy to glaze and delicious. i used the zest of 1 lemon to simplify things - it turns out to be about 2 tsp. i'll definitely put this recipe in my favorites.

These were really great. I baked them at 325 because my oven runs hot, and they turned out juuuust right! Next time I would add double the lemon zest to the cookies, to balance out the buttermilk. Also, I glazed mine, let the glaze set, and then re-glazed them to get a little more intense sweet kick as well as a pretty opaque white look on the tops. Anyway, really light and delicious, can't wait to take them over to the neighbors!

These were excellent! I only made a 1/2 batch, they were gone quickly. I can't wait to make them again. These are for sure added to my 'favorites' when it is time to make cookies. Very simple, light, delicate. You can't eat just one!
