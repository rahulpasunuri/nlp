We really enjoyed this recipe as is as an alternative to eating radishes raw (and a great way to use garden excess). I recommend substituting the parsely for rosemary, however. Additionally, as a complete alternative, saute a clove of garlic in butter, and then add radishes, scallions, and sliced carrots. Complete with lemon zest, rosemary, and fresh ground pepper. Both versions are unique.

Tried this because I had a lot of leftover radishes from a holiday crudite platter and was curious to know if there was some way to prepare them other than contiuing to serve them raw. I followed the recipe fairly closely but at the end, on a whim, I added some crumbled feta and I think this made the dish more interesting. The cooked radish definitely tasted different, something like parsnip but somewhat more assertive. I served it more as an accessory than a true vegetable dish, offering it with roast beef, asparagus and potatoes. Its unique taste complemented the beef well and was attractive to look at as well. If the option were provided, I would have rated this 2 1/2 forks. Approaching delicious but not something you'd love so much as to want to do very often.
