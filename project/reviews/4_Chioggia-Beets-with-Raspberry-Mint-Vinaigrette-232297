I use regular beets and I roast them rather than boil them, but this doesn't hamper my enjoyment. This is absolutely delicious and has become a go-to recipe for side-dishes and light lunches.

I've probably made this salad half-a-dozen times in the past 3 months. I've always used regular beets, and I don't boil them but bake them in foil. Everything else I follow to the letter. It is so delicious, I can eat an entire pound of beets prepared this way as a single meal. SO TASTY!

Great recipe - so refreshing and a great display for the beets. It was very beautiful on the plate, and the mint with the orange really adds a nice pop of flavor.

Lovely way to use the beautiful and delicious chioggia beets from our farmers' market - keeps well in the fridge because of the lasting power of the vinegar and the beets. Would do just as well with half the green onions.

Very tasty salad. I have never seen chioggia beets--I used some small tubular ones. The mint is unique and actually made the salad seem cool even though it was served at room temperature. It was not necessary to buy more than one orange for the zest. One will do.

I made this recipe as-is, except used golden beets. It was great. It was fresh tasting with a lot of flavor and very healthy. What a great alternative for a fresh summer salad!
