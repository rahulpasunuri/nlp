Wow! This is a great easy weeknight meal, although I felt it was probably more like 4 servings than 2. I used 1/3 hot and 2/3 sweet sausage for just a nice touch of heat. Also used fresh parpadelle (bought from a local pasta company) which needed a little more thickness to hold the sauce so added about 2 tlb of heavy cream , some water cornstarch combo and tossed the pasta with about 2 tlb of butter...and doubled the garlic which is standard for my cooking...it was delicious and will be added to our rotation.

quite good and simple to prepare. tossed the pasta in olive oil to keep it from sticking while the sauce finished, and added some of the pasta water to thicken the sauce. hot italian sausage is my preference. will definitely make again.

I was looking for summer recipes and found this one. I used spicy Italian sausage and added a tiny bit of olive oil (not much though, since the sausage is oily enough), just for added flavor. I liked the light consistency of the sauce. Any thicker and it would have been too rich for a summer dish. My boyfriend liked it so much, he did the dishes!

Husband LOVED this recipe, despite initial concerns that it "wasn't like Mom makes". In fact, he asked that wI make it -- next week -- for his mom. That's the highest praise!

I searched for a recipe that sounded good, but simple. This one is simple, but not good. It is great! I gave it 3 forks instead of 4, because the sauce is slightly thin. I thickened mine by removing 1/4 cup of the sauce, adding a couple tsps. of flour, and returning this to the sauce to thicken. I liked it much better. So I give my revised version 4 forks!

This was simply delicious! I used one spicy and one mild italian sausage, three peppers and more garlic. Super good!!

I have mixed feelings about this dish: on one hand, the combination of ingredients isn't earth-shakingly original, but on the other hand, the proportions are good and results worthwhile. It's incredibly fast and, though the sauce is on the thin side, quite tasty. I used spicy turkey sausage, so don't think this would succeed with sweet (too bland), and also used 3 large garlic cloves, a hefty shake of onion powder, and 2 tbsp tomato paste in the sauce. Also used rigatoni instead of linguine, and will definitely make it again--it's super fast, good, and pretty healthy even if not the most original dish in the world.

I really enjoyed this dish and have made it several times since I found the recipe. It's easy, fast, pretty, even elegant in its own way. I used a red and an orange bell pepper, and added some fresh chopped parsley at very end of cooking time. More wine doesn't hurt either! This is a very adaptable recipe.

This dish was very good even though I don't care for bell peppers very much. I, however, did like the flavor they gave to the dish. The rest of my family loved it very much because they like bell peppers.
