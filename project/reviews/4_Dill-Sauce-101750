This was easy and so good! After tasting it, I did add more sour cream. I did end up adding more dill just because I wanted to use it up, and it stood up well with my salmon burgers with arugula.

This was a good bare bones recipe but i added lemon juice and loads more dill and green onions and it was awesome! i put it on crab cakes with a lemon and truffle rissotto.

This is a great recipe. We added a tablespoon of lemon flavored vinegar and it made it even better.

I had to add more sour cream as I could taste mayo, next time I will do 2 to 1. Took the recommendation of more dill and onion. I also added about 7 leaves (not sprigs!) of finely chopped rosemary. Super simple with no fancy ingredients!

I added far more dill and green onion. The sauce was easy and yummy.

I saw the suggestions to use cilantro and more dill- did both and added chopped tomatoes to put the sauce over wahoo fish. Was wonderful! Will definitely do this again!

OK, so I changed it a bit. I served this with fish (honey and soy glazed salmon-recipe at this site). I used dried, minced onion instead of fresh, because fresh onion, in something like this, seems to take over the whole flavor. I also changed the parsley to cilantro. I used about a tablespoon of dried dill. I really like dill and 1 teaspoon did not look like enough. Because of the dried onion, I made this a few hours ahead. We will use the leftovers as a dip, as this recipe mades quite a bit more than we needed.
