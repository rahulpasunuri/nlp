This is an amazing dish it wows company every time and it is so reasonable to make I made dinner for 20 people with this for $100.00 If you shop right. I get the Pork roast at Cost Co you have to cut it lengh wise though and then all the canned stuff at target! Great dish real wow power and so yummy.

This is an outstanding "do ahead" crowd pleaser for summer! (although I would eat it year round it's so good. I "tried it out" last week for our upcoming family vacation and there is NO QUESTION that I will make it again and again! You definitely can make everything the day before...just don dress the salad until the day of. I used a pork loin and marinated for a day and a half and seared it first on the BBQ before roasting. Fabulous! However, I do love tenderloins, and that's what I will use on our vacation.

This is one of the most colorful and beautiful dishes you will ever make. We have been making it for special occasions for years, and it will be the center of attention for Father's Day again this year. Everyone LOVES this!

OK, I did alot of tweaking, but the results were fabulous. Since I consider pork tenderloin to be dry and flavorless, I used pork shoulder. Sauteed the rub ingredients in olive oil, then browned the pork, then added 2 cups water and cooked in pressure cooker for 50 minutes. Made the sauce as writted, but blended with immersion blender after cooking. Made the salad as written except used rice instead of beans and used canned diced tomatoes. Overall great summer meal!

The pork was very good, but not amazing. I just don't care for oven roasted pork tenderloin, so after cooking it, I let it rest a few hours and then threw it on the grill to crisp up on the outside. The sauce was OK, but not stellar, but I did make a golden pineapple chutney that was fabulous with it.

i used a boston butt and cooked it on low in the slow cooker for about 7 hrs. i also added garlic to the sauce/marinade- because- why not? it's begging for it!

This was one of the first things I ever made for my husband (back when he was just a new boyfriend) and he looooved it. I reviewed it then (in 2000) as a total novice cook and I'll say it again now as a total intermediate cook: delicious! Anyone can pull this off and impress-- and possibly even get married. I haven't made it in a long while, but I'm putting it on our menu for next week 'cause I'm feelin' nostalgic. I wonder if he'll recognize it? (And, yes, even 10 years later I remember that the sauce didn't work out for me. I think it needs more time than the recipe calls for.)

Loved this dish, the orange ginger sauce was delicious, the salad was simple, healthy and delicious. The pork was excellent in cubano style sandwiches with provolone and mayos from another recipe (one with srirachi sauce and another w/ mint & shallots). Definitely a keeper, the salad wasn't as good the second day, got a little watery and mushy. Great on day one.

There is simply no better way to prepare pork! Perfect for summer entertaining, this is bursting with flavors that make your mouth happy. Easy and do ahead, fresh and healthy. I used a Pork Loin Roast and adjusted the cooking time accordingly.

I've been making both the pork and the black bean, heart of palm, & corn salad since I first saw this in the original Aug '92 Bon Appetit edition. I was so happy to find it online while away from my own kitchen and cookbooks. This is always a hit with family and guests, especially the salad. People are always asking for the recipes.

Just made this tonight for a dinner party that I catered. Everyone loved it. Served it with the black bean salad from this recipe, coconut rice and coconut creme brulee (both recipes from ecicurious.com). I did not, however, care for the sauce. It took over an hour to reduce to the right consistency and it was too strong w/ all those shallots (I even strained it before serving). I did serve it w/ the sauce and everyone else liked it. I hated it and thought the pork was juicy enough without it.

Rating: 4
I made this for a large family gathering and it was a big hit. I loved the different take on gravy (oj and ginger) and it was very easy to prepare. I used a 3.5 pound piece of meat and at the temperature recommended in the recipe it required about an hour in the oven to reach the required inner temperature. That being said, I didn't have quite enough time to let the meat rest before the crowd took over and dug in, so that is the only thing I would do differently. The take on salad was really different and refreshing (even a notoriously picky 10 year-old ate it) and I've been making this version of salad dressing for the rest of the summer!

This was a great summer recipe. Even my fiance' who doesn't like "salads," liked this very much. I made with thin pork loin medallions rather than than the full tenderloin and adjusted the cooking time. It was wonderful.

Rating: 4
A great summer dish, though I crave it in winter too. Sometimes don't bother with the pork rub and just use a pre marinated roast. The sauce is key but you have to let it simmer longer than suggested. Serve with a spanish rice on the side.

Rating: 2
I probably should give this recipe 3 forks because I marinated overnight and that was a mistake - made that great flavor a bit overpowering. The salad is fab - but definitely keep it in colander til ready to serve and then add the lemon juice etc. or you'll end up with too much liquid. My family makes a meal out of just the salad during the week.

Absolutely delicious! And, it can all be made ahead of time, which makes it even better. Perfect for a hot summer night. Also, I was able to get the sauce to a "syrup" consistancy by letting it simmer for close to 30 minutes (this was purely by accident, as I was doing something else and forgot about it being on the stove).

We loved the spice rub. I put it on a center-cut pork loin roast about 36 hrs in advance. Delicious, will definitely do that again. Wasn't crazy about the sauce, and it never seemed to get syrupy as the recipe described. Didn't make the salad but will try that next time.

Very good! I don't have much new to add here except that this meal was a great do-ahead. I cooked from 10-noon, then was able to be with my guests until dinner! Definitely make extra - even though my family is not big on meat, they ate all 2.25 pounds! (5 people)

I made this for friends and everyone thought it was wonderful. I put the rub on the pork a couple hours ahead and refrigerated. I made the salad and sauce a day ahead. This recipe is so easy and all make ahead. I roasted the pork on convection and it was so flavorful and moist. I served it with a baguette for a very simple but fabulous dinner.

I have made this dish many times for as few as 4 guests and as many as 24. Each time it has met with rave reviews and numberous requests for the recipe. My one suggestion is to be sure to allow lots of time for the black beans and corn to drain. Otherwise, the salad can become soggy.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe. To be able to make a dish this flavorful the day before -- could you ask for anything better? My guests loved it. I used less cilantro (we haven't fully developed our taste buds for this herb yet) and the result was still excellent.

This was pretty darn good, and very easy. I used a pork roast rather than a tenderloin, but it didn't make a difference. This is a fool-proof recipe, with great potential to be used with other types of meat and in other food venues. I made the accompanying salad, and I agree with the writer who said that the sum of the whole is greater than the parts. A super easy and elegant "company" dish. I would recommend de-glazing the pan with the sauce--Deep, rich and delicious, this recipe is a must-do.

This was great. I almost never write reviews, but this recipe is worth it. Despite the number of ingredients, it's not very hard to do, and my husband said it was like eating out, at home! I toned down the amount of onion and cilantro in the salad and loved it anyway.

I was the third person EVER to rate this menu and can't BELIEVE how many people have rated it since!! It is STILL the one I bring out to treat special guests to something off the beaten path. I still always get RAVE reviews. TRY IT - it is worth the time and effort.

Rating: 3
Highly recommended. Don't worry about the sweetness of the sauce - It cuts the richness of the pork and works well with the bean salad. I ended up adding more olive oil to the salad just before serving as well as tossing the spinach with a simple mustard vinegarette. I also grilled the pork instead of roasting in the oven. Great on a hot summer night.

Rating: 3
Lovely interplay of flavors in this completed dish. The gingered pork, soaked in the orange juice, brown sugar and ginger sauce when tasted alone seemed quite sweet--however, in concert with the mild, buttery avocado and the cilantro/lime/corriander soaked corn, tomato, black bean salad was delicious and unlike anything I can remember tasting before. My mother absolutely loved it, while her sceptical husband ate two large servings, but with suspicion, as he professed to prefer hamburgers.

Rating: 4
I think this recipe turned out more delicious than the sum of it's parts...The combination of flavors was great. It's winter here and I wanted hot side dishes, so I made the Cuban Black Beans and Sweet Corn Pudding recipes on epicurious. Instead of the black bean/corn salad I served the pork with a bed of lemon coleslaw (also epicurious)Whole menu was delicious...try it!

Not a fan of sweet meat dishes, I was pleasantly surprised.. the guests raved though.. I used a Pork Roast.. I added 1 tbs garlic to the spices and combined all with Olive oil to form a nice paste which I covered the roast with and let sit for a few hours prior to cooking... Also served all hot thickly sliced with Spinach and Avocado sliced on top... looked so nice one dinner guest even took a picture!!

Beautiful! I made this in Mid-August, on vacation at a rustic cabin. The guys wanted more pork, so make plenty. The ladies polished off the salad - it was so good! I loved every bit of the cilantro; my only change for next time would be less allspice in the sauce.

Rating: 3
Loved the pork- VERY simple and easy. I made this on a scorching hot day and it was great to just put the tenderloins in the electric fryingpan outside, brown them on high and then simmer on med. for 7-8 minutes. THe sauce was good, but I ran out of orange juice, so I made a reduction of saskatoon berries (we have lots of s. bushes on our farm) and used that as well - got rave reviews!! As for the salad, DEFINITELY do this one the night before. I used the prescribed amount of cilantro and it was very overpowering. It took 24 hours in the fridge to let the flavors blend and mello out. (For which I was grateful. I was ready to go to town and buy the ingredients all over again to make a non-cilantro powered salad.)

A great meal for a summer Sunday. I grilled the tenderloins and added roasted jalapeno to the salad. The only other thing I'd do differently next time is cut the sweetness in the sauce, as it can be a bit cloying. I might cut the brown sugar by a tablespoon or reduce the OJ somewhat and add chicken stock in its place. The allspice-infused pork was very elegant. Great for outdoor entertaining.

The pork: awesome, awesome, awesome!!! The sauce is surprisingly complex and good, and the pork cooks up tender every time. I have made it six of seven times now for company, and it never, ever goes wrong. Can't say I'm too pro on the salad, though. Never been a hearts of palm fan, myself. I serve this in the summer with a chilled honeydew bisque (which is a nice, sweet complement), good bread, a green salad, and follow with a cheese plate and grilled figs. Raves every time!

I thought it was great! Friends brought tenderloin already sliced so instead of roasting, we put the tenderloin on the grill pan. Perfectly light for a summer meal. I left the cilantro on the side as a garnish for the salad, and people could take some if they wanted it. Also, used one ear of fresh corn in place of frozen corn. Next time, use 2 ears.

I made this to take to the beach for a weekend.It was the perfect dish to end a relaxing,hot day .I prepared it the day before and simply put it on a platter and heated up the sauce.It was fabulous .I made it just as the recipe indicated and included the black bean corn salad which was very colorful and flavorful.We felt wer were vacationing in the islands.The dish got lots of "ooohs" and "aaahs" by other vacationers who were sadly eating their boxed version of fried chicken.Lucky us.

I love a recipe that does not require the cook to marinate overnight and this recipe was so easy. An excellent dish for a pork roast, tasty and perfectly cooked. Try paring the roast with apricot chutney and corn pudding or on a bed of baby spinache, white beans tossed with xtra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Rating: 3
I've done this one a couple of times. All were great. My favorite was when I grilled it rather than roasting. To do this, allow the pork to marinate overnight. Pan sear on all sides using olive oil to seal in the juices. Using a kettle grill like a Webber, pile two banks of coals on opposite sides of the bottom. Place a drip pan between and place the loin over the drip pan on the rack. Insert a meat thermometer and allow the loin to roast (no turning needed) until it reaches 170 degrees. Enjoy!

My husband must have said "Excellent!" fifty times during dinner!!! This is a very good recipe. The flavor is wonderful. I followed the recipe to a T and loved it. The only change I would make is the serving suggestion. I would not serve the salad on the same plate as the pork and avocados. This is just a personal preference as I can't stand my food touching! I am going to try the sauce with a pork roast (versus the more expensive tenderloin) and see how it works...my guess is it will be fabulous!

Rating: 4
This is a great meal for those that like ginger, orange, and pork. Roast pork is one of my favorites and this recipe will see our kitchen again. Besides the great tropical taste the pork was the most moist and tender that I have ever had. We did not make the salad but rather served the pork with rice and kidney beans flavored with coconut milk and scallions. They worked very will together. This was all followed by mango sorbet. If only I were enjoying this in Montego Bay and not Queens!

I've made the salad many times before as it goes well with just about anything. I've shared the recipe with others and they think it's very good, too. I finally made the pork and served it on spinach leaves with the salad as suggested. We would now rate the dish as given with four forks, because it deserves it. I didn't have an avocado, so fried up some tostones (Goya brand makes these frozen) as a excellent side dish. Note: it took a very long time for the sauce to reduce, so factor that in.

Very easy recipe to cook. Made a black bean & rice side dish along with some corn as accompaniments. Think that the side salad with this recipe sounds brilliant, however, I didn't make the extra effort to obtain all the ingredients that I needed. I tasted the pork right out of the oven & it was juicy. However, I didn't serve it to my boyfrient until later in the evening & I thought that the pork had dried considerably. Although, he gave it a "3 fork". (He know the rating system for my dishes & he helps me to assess recipes). It's fun.

We made this using a pork tri-tip roast and it was delicious. Cooking time was quite a bit longer, of course, than for the loins. The sauce perfumed the entire house as it was reducing; the flavors were bright and a great compliment to the meat. My husband made a rice pilaf, which was a good way to soak up every last bit of sauce. A definite make again recipe!

This recipe was a super- hit when I served it at a dinner party for 6. You can do almost everything in advance and it makes a very dramatic presentation when served. Plus, its delicious!

First of all, the salad is phenomenal! I cannot get enough of it. Easy, beautiful, healthy, and delic! I did not have as much luck with the meat, however. After 30 minutes at 450 degrees (I have never been concerned with my oven temps before), I had meat that registered at around 100-110 degrees. After putting it back in the oven at 500 degrees and still having no luck, I ended up slicing the meat and microwaving it, just so I could eat at a decent hour. My sauce did not turn syrupy, even after simmering 15 minutes. But in the end, it tasted great. My boyfriend liked it a lot. I will try it again, and use the salad with different entrees.
