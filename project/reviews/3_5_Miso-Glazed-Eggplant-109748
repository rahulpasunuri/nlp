Served this one as a side to a brined, green peppercorn glazed, crispy duck. Perfect! --I did, however, use seasoned rice vinegar, murin instead of water, and just a pinch of sugar, so maybe it's close but not the same.

Following this recipe exactly led to an overly salty eggplant. I had to scrape off the "glaze" so it would be edible. That said, after scraping the glaze off, it was delicious. Next time, I will use 1/2 as much miso and probably more water.

Lesson learned: read the reviews before making the recipe. The glaze was (as many others have noted) too thick. There was also so much of it that I assumed I should lay it on thickly Result: very salty, with the glaze overpowering the eggplant. I love eggplant and I love miso, so I'll try this again but I'll add more water and assume that the glaze suffices for at least twice as many eggplants.

Such an easy recipe to use the asian eggplants I always get too many of. I agree it's not a "glaze" in the strict use of the term, but do you care? It comes out looking appetizingly golden, it so easy to make and tastes OMG. Wouldn't touch a thing.

I was so wanting to love this recipe and just found it okay. I used a bit more water, per the previous reviews, about 2 1/2 Tablespoons, but still found the miso mixture very thick. Certainly not a glaze at all. I did use 1 Tablespoon of agave nectar, as another reviewer suggested as I didn't want it to be too sweet, so perhaps that threw something off. Bummer.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The only thing I would change is the amount of water in the glaze. As other have mentioned, it came out very thick, and because of that it didn't really soak into the eggplant as much as I would have liked. Other than that, the taste was wonderful; not too salty and well balanced.

I made this dish last night and found the sauce to be too thick. Next time I will add more water to thin it out. I also found the sauce burned quickly under the broiler so keep an eye on it. I added some extra sauce overtop when serving, which was totally unnecessary as the flavor overpowered the eggplant. All in all it was a quick healthy side and I would make it again.

A very nice recipe. The eggplant cooked perfectly. The miso glaze is a bit thick - I would recommend using more water to make a thinner glaze and coating the eggplant 3 or 4 times in between broiling (instead of 2) to make sure you have enough flavor.

Yummy! Lovely with some sushi rice and greens for a quick weeknight dinner. I think the cook time is a little high, though. Made the eggplant a bit too mushy. I'd like to try this on the grill this summer.

This is very similar to the Miso Eggplant served at my favorite Japanese restaurant. You MUST use white or yellow miso, red is too strong. I substituted mirin for the water and a teaspoon of agave syrup because I didn't want it too sweet, also a splash of soy sauce. Also, I brushed the eggplants with oil and broiled them skin side up first for about 2 minutes, turned them over, broiled them for 2 more minutes so they were already cooked before I added the miso mixture. They were both crisp and soft, really delicious. I tossed the extra miso mixture with some sliced cucumbers and served them with the eggplant. The flavor was different and also great on the cucumbers.

very the good and easy. if you have the right type of miso and good quality it will be worth it. but what i dont understand is why do people bother to rate this recipe if they don't even use the main ingredient for the glaze? the rating isn't accurate then!

This is delicious... but a better recipe in the miso and red curry eggplant with hericot vert. delicious!

Rating: 3
Lovely if made correctly. Be careful not to add too much ginger--I found it overpowered the shiso miso. The recipe will not be the same if you don't have the right kind of miso--the red miso does not have the carmel like sweetness of the miso called for in this dish.

This did nothing for me. What would you serve this with? BUT! (I hate it when people say they didn't use such and such ingredient!) I used dark miso as I was trying to use it up. Anyway, no great shakes.

Excellent recipe, I also added more fresh ginger, and with the left over marinade I used it on firm tofu that was then grilled until brown and firm. A great combo!

Very nice. I had no ginger in the house, so I used garlic which produced a tasty dish, but I imagine that ginger will be a better match. I also used a standard eggplant cut into eighths. I had about half the miso mixture left over afterwords and look forward to using it again.

This is a fabulous recipe. I only had one very large eggplant on hand, but it tasted just fine. I also used red miso and followed the advice of another reviewr by adding more sugar and it was a perfect combo of flavors, not too salty, not too sweet.

I was skeptical but used all the glaze -- it absorbed more than I'd expected after the first application and broiling, and it ended up nicely but not overly saucy. It was salty, but in a good way.

We really liked this recipe. I couldn't find white miso and used red. It was good that way. I did up the sugar just a bit...just tasted until I felt it was right.

perfect side to a japanese-style meal. incredibly quick and easy to make (assuming you've got everything in the pantry)

This is agreat alternative vegetable dish. I have made it several times and it is always disappears. I usually serve it with seared tuna steak and sesame greens beans.

I loved this dish. Used the right miso, but cut down on it a little, added extra ginger and also some mirin. Like the others said, I only used about half the sauce. Asian eggplants are a must.

I used small globe eggplants and cut them vertically in thirds. Following the advice of previous reviewers, I broiled them for five minutes, skin side up, first, then turned them and applied the glaze. Waited two or three minutes and applied a second round of glaze. The eggplants took on a lovely red color, were thoroughly cooked and not too salty. Half the glaze was left over -- anybody got an idea of how to use it up?

Rating: 3
Overall, the flavors and seasonings are very tasty. However, I do agree that it is on the salty side. The next time I make it, I'll brush the eggplant more lightly and expect it to be awesome. Easy to prepare.

Made it with red miso as that is what he had at home. It was good. Would advise to only use a light glaze. That's probably why other reviewers had a problem with it being too salty.

eggplant was completely overtaken by the miso, and it was extremely salty and unenjoyable to eat. not like the delicate glaze pictured in the photo at all.

We used the right miso and followed the recipe exactly, but it came out Miso-Crusted Eggplant. Too much miso, not enough liquid and oil, maybe. Very very salty and unpleasant.

Rating: 1
We ate it, but can't say we loved it. Didn't even bother trying to find out how it tastes the next day because I threw out the left-over. Maybe all the great Japanese restaurants in Tokyo spoiled it for me, but the miso in this recipe combined with the ginger is too overpowering. You can't taste the delicate Japanese eggplant at all.

This was great.... if grating ginger is a pain, try using a microplane zester. It does a great job (pardon the pun) of grating ginger and garlic.

After initial confusion over the Shiro Miso (I accidentally bought the brown miso. It had a completely different, and dare I say unwanted, effect) I finally got this recipe right. It was fabulous! Grating the ginger was kind of a pain, but I think next time I'll try store-bought ginger-garlic paste and see how that works. This was delicious with Holland Eggplants.

this is one of my favorite ways to prepare eggplant. another favorite is to roast the eggplant in the broiler. peel the skin off and cut into bite-sized pieces. drizzle with soy and sesame oil. very simple and very yummy.

ok but the miso is what makes it!! there is no reasonable fascimile!! this is most amazing way to make eggplant. i can't recommend it enough. there is probably a lot of variation from the kind of miso you use though--so experiment!

Ok, I admit that I didn't use the Miso, which I'm sure makes a big impact on the flavor. I wanted to, I just didn't have any in my kitchen. However, it was pretty good just throwing together some random asian ingredients I had in my kitchen, and what I really liked is that this is an eggplant recipe that cooks eggplant well without using 10 cups of oil. Make sure to cook it long enough, and turn the eggplant, otherwise you risk burning them.
