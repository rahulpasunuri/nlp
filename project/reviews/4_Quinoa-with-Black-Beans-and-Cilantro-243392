I make this recipe often. I add the juice of two limes, as well as the zest, and I double the cumin. Serve this with pan seared tilapia, topped with cilantro pesto and jalapeno lime butter. Beautiful and delicious, it will impress your guests!

I made this recipe with a side of chunky avocado mixed in with some lemon juice and accidently turned this dish into something that tasted like a delicious deconstructed burrito. This is my children's new favorite dish!

I am not a quinoa person at all. I just can't really get into it. But my partner is vegetarian and he loves it, so I've been trying to be flexible. I made this with pretty low expectations. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. I actually have made this recipe multiple times and it is my new go to quinoa recipe. It's not too fussy and is great on a cold night. I have found that really any crumbly cheese works, I especially like feta. Also lime juice is essential to this dish. I love the suggestions of avocado and corn and will try it. I bet it would work great.

The flavors of the cilantro, chili powder and coriander really set each other off. I did add the juice of one lemon as another reviewer suggested, and I only had one small red onion on hand, but it turned out great! This is an easy, tasty, and healthy dish that I'll make again!

Very good but needed to add lime and/or the fresh salsa that I had just made with lime/tomatoes/jalapeno/cilantro. Also tasted good with chips. Very tasty!

I loved this recipe! Flavoring the water and then letting the chili powder and cumin absorb into the quinoa was delightfully flavorful. I added several other ingredients: corn, juice of 1 lime, chopped green onions and 1 chopped avocado. The crumbled queso fresco really added to the dish. I think it will be great cold, too!

Great flavor and texture! I did not modify or substitute anything and cooked it exactly as written. This will go in our "keeper" book. I will try to add more color next time by using a mix of red, yellow and orange peppers.

I toasted the quinoa ahead of time, used vegetable broth rather than water (next time I'd use half water, half broth), and chipotle chili rather than just chili powder. I also added roasted eggplant I dusted with cumin. It was wonderful!

I modified this recipe a bit, thinking that it would be great as filling for either stuffed peppers or stuffed cabbage. Because I ended up making stuffed peppers I omitted the red bell pepper and added fresh corn. I added some cayenne and crushed red pepper. Instead of water, I used vegetable stock to cook the quinoa. It is excellent, so tasty. Highly recommended!

Good but not great. I almost didn't bring it to the potluck, since the quinoa came out kind of mushy and overall taste was bland.

This is a fabulous recipe, and makes a very healthy meal. I used Mexican sweet peppers instead of the bell pepper, and was more heavy-handed with the spices. The cheese (I had feta) is a great finishing touch and pulls it together nicely. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved it! Will be a staple.

Have made this recipe at least 10 times in the last 1 year. And I don't even eat cilantro, but it just goes so well. Follow the recipe exactly as it and use feta cheese. Buy the big bag of quinoa from Costco and it's gone before I know it.

Loved it! I know everyone keeps describing it as a cold salad, but I served it hot, with grilled chicken and avocado slices. So delicious, and even better heated up for lunch the next day. This one is a keeper for sure.

I made this and my whole family loved it. The only changes I made was that I upped the cumin to 1 t (we really like cumin) and I thought it needed a little acid, so I added some fresh lime juice. I let the salad cool in the refrigerator before adding the cheese/remaining cilantro and also threw in some fresh grape tomatoes. I will definitely be making this again!

I cooked the quinoa in veg. broth and omitted the cheese. It's delicious, quick, nutritious and can be modified to suit lots of tastes. Just don't change the dressing recipe; it makes the dish. To maximize flavor, do let this one sit overnight.

Completely forgot the cheese but it was still delicious, not to mention quick and healthy. I added a jalapeno and used ancho chili powder instead of regular for some smokiness. Very tasty and I will definitely make again and again.

Whoops. Re the 8.17.10 review, that was for the quinoa and black bean salad. Carelessly posted under the wrong black bean salad.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. It's light, quick, and so healthy. Like many reviewers, I didn't bother with the fetishistic quinoa preparation, and instead cooked the quinoa according to the package directions. I did substitute more olive oil for the butter -- butter just seemed wrong in a cold salad. As I've fiddled with it, I found it's best with extra lime juice, and diced red pepper. I've also substituted pinto beans in a pinch, and it's still delicious.

Rating: 3
Just delicious. I didn't use black beans because I had fresh black eyed peas, so I substituted those instead. I also used feta cheese and added a squeeze of lime, which brightened up the dish without distracting from it. Excellent flavors, very nice and easy enough to make. Looking forward to having it again for lunch tomorrow.

Rating: 3
This is a quick, simple, tasty, and highly versatile dish. I made this mostly as written,except I left out the pepper because I don't like bell pepper, and I used red quinoa because it's what I had. Honestly, it would almost be better without cheese - this could possibly be because I love cilantro so much and a stronger cheese can overpower the other flavors in the dish. I think next time I will add some tomato paste when I add in the quinoa for some additional depth of flavor. I used chicken broth instead of water because I had some to use up, but this would be totally fine with water.

Rating: 4
Delicious, fast, and healthy! I also switched out water for stock and olive oil for vegetable oil. When I've had some leftover corn in my freezer, I've added that in as well.

I absolutely loved the way this recipe came out! I had never tried making quinoa before and it was very easy. I added avocado slices and chicken breast seasoned with cumin at the end and they complimented the plate well.

Aha! This was the moment I've been trying to find in my house. My guy loved this dish because I called it "black bean salad",. He (we) ate all the leftovers too. Now he's a fan of quinoa! It's really delish too.

Very good...with a few changes: 1.) used chicken broth instead of water (I'm sure veggie broth would be great, too!) 2.) added 1 small zucchini and 1 small squash, both cubed. 3) used EVOO instead of veggie oil 4.) didn't add beans since the beans in my pantry turned out to be kidney and not black after all.... We served this with grilled chicken and a spicy dill yogurt sauce (1/2 C greek yogurt, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 2 tsp dill) Picky fiance love it.... !! :)

Rating: 0
Actually, a good suggestion would be to use olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and butter. Veggie oil is not good for you...and really, neither is butter. Though butter would be better than margerine. Also, adding salt/pepper to taste to bring the flavor out more. I tried it also with the fresh avocado after reading the suggestion...delicious!! A reminder-most quinoa needs to be rinsed to take off that outter layer, but i think the arrowhead(?) brand comes pre-rinsed.

Only used one onion. Served w/grilled fish.... so good!

Wow! This was delicious! I've been looking for recipes to make quinoa more flavorful and this one definitely fits the bill. The only changes I made were to add some chopped zucchini, use vegetable stock instead of the water and add some red pepper flakes to give it a bit of heat. Even my meat-eating husband loved it. This one's going into the regular rotation.

This was my first experience with quinoa and I was really pleasantly surprised by this dish. The cilantro and feta (I used reduced fat feta) are essential and I tried lime juice as other commenters suggested. I also added in some chicken I had from a rotisserie chicken in the fridge. It was excellent and will become a regular dish for me!

This is a fantastic recipe. I also substituted chicken broth for water, upped the cilantro, added lots of garlic, added a tiny bit of cayenne pepper and squeezed some lemon juice at the end. The feta should also be a must. Still a great starter recipe.

This was my first time making quinoa and I'm glad I used this recipe. It was great tasting and easy to make. I used 1 tsp cayenne instead of the chili power since that is what I had in the cupboard (my only substitution). My lunch guests loved it with some corn chips and salsa and thought it might be good served cold as well.

Ok, this is a great start, but it needs more flavor. I like some of the reviewers' suggestions. Next time, I will use chicken broth instead of water, up the seasonings a little, especially the salt (hey, you only live once!) and start to cook the onions before the peppers so that they have time to get a little carmelized.

This recipe was VERY tasty. I used some of the variations listed below, including cooking the quinoa separately and then adding to the veggies and beans, I added a can of corn, and I added a large, chopped fresh tomato.

These flavors go great together. However I found that the onions and peppers got too mushy when cooked with the quinoa. Next time I'll saute them as instructed, but wait to add them in with the beans. I also added a jalepeno and some lime juice, which went nicely.

This recipe was really easy and didn't take much time at all. The first time I served it as a side dish along with steak tacos. The second time I wrapped the mix into a large flour tortilla and made burritos out of it. I preferred the second method and want to try making a larger batch and freezing the burritos ahead of time. Next time I will increase the amount of beans and I might also put some chopped zucchini in at the beginning.

I toasted some almond slivers and added in. The extra crunch adds an excellent new layer to the salad. Also Sheep milk feta works the best. It is a little drier and easier to crumble.

I have made this several times and enjoy it for being easy to prepare on a weeknight, and healthy. It also freezes and reheats well. Just don't skip the cilantro and the cheese, I find it gets too bland without them!

I love this! I'm watching my weight so I made it with only 1 tsp. of oil and didn't miss the rest of the oil one bit. I also substituted fat free chicken broth for water to add a little flavor, which is probably why I didn't think it needed more than 1/2 tsp. salt. I'm putting this in my file to use again very soon!

Rating: 3
A real winner. Very easy to prepare - and I even cooked up my own black beans. In place of the cotija I used a crumbly feta that was so good that I'm not sure I can rationally appraise the rest of the dish! Suffice to say that unless you're vegan, the little bit of cheese on top should not be skipped.

Rating: 3
Healthy, tasty and packs a protein punch. I added a can of yellow corn to give it a little more Southwestern feel. I cooked the quinoa with the spices in a saucepan. I sauteed the onion and red bell pepper in a separate pan - so they both could cook at the same time. Then I folded the cooked quinoa in with the sauteed veggies, cilantro, corn and black beans. So it was more the method I changed more than the ingredients. Oh, I also squeezed the juice from one lime on top. It all came together in about 15-min. from walking in the kitchen to walking out with a plate of this tasty dish for dinner at 8:15 pm.

This is quick and healthy side that tastes great with a little modification. I took advice of others and doubled the salt since I did not add cheese. I also added juice from half a lemon and its zest at the end. I saved a little chopped red pepper that I added at the end to add a little crunch. I served this chilled with some grilled chicken and it was the perfect accompaniment.

I liked this dish. I agree with some reviewers that it needed more salt and next time I will use broth as well to add a little depth to the flavor. Also I would suggest a quite generous amount of feta. We ate this as our main dish and it served 2 with a half serving left over.

Very tasty. I made a few changes, however, due to others complaints about a lack of salt and acidity, and my rating reflects this. Instead of using water, I used veggie stock, and I shaved some lemon zest over it after it was done. Because of the veggie stock, I didn't need to add any salt or cheese and the lemon zest adds a nice contrast in flavor.

This was great and very easy! I halved the recipe (cooking for one, sadly) and I used cannellini beans. I doubled the salt as recommended, and I didn't have cilantro so at the last minute I added a little dried rosemary (which I think is maybe a bit weird). It still tasted good though! I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top and that was great. I will make it again and try it with cilantro or parsley leaves.

This is a very easy and remarkably tasty weeknight meal or potluck dish. Since I have some vegetarians in my family, I especially appreciated the fact that it's vegan if you leave out the cheese. I used Monterrey Jack cheese instead of cotija, which was quite good, but I had to add a little extra salt to the dish.

Good, solid, basic recipe. I added a jalapeno and some portobello mushrooms. It'd probably be better with some fresh grated parmesan instead of feta. I also agree with doubling the salt.
