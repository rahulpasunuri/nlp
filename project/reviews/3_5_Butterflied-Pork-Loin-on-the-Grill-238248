This was tasty! A nice, different way to serve pork. I too had a smaller loin--1.43 lbs-enough for 3 or 4 people. I cooked it for 45 min on indirect heat gas grill and it was nice and moist. It would go very well with a mango or pineapple chutney.

We really liked the flavor of the paste although thought it was a bit "soupy", more like a marinade. Only left it on for a few hours and had great flavor. Used pork tenderloin instead of roast and decreased cooking time. Also used carribean hot sauce for the hot pepper sauce.

This was delicious! First, let me say that the recipe is a little incomplete, so that's why I gave 3 forks. The jerk paste needs to be put in the food processor or blender and it doesn't say that in the recipe. Also, if you are using a gas grill, light 1 or 2 burners and set the meat on the one that's not lit for indirect heat. I had a 1.5 pound loin and it took about 50 minutes. The flavor was great, although mellow for a jerk. I would add more hot sauce and more allspice next time. I served with a peach chutney and sweet potato fries. Yumm.
