This was really yummy... I followed the instructions almost as written, but made more topping (using panko crumbs instead of saltines) and felt that was the right amount... less wouldn't have been nearly as good! I also used horseradish cheddar to replace 1/3 of the sharp cheddar just to get a little of the flavor to be throughout the dish, instead of just on top. There was plenty of sauce, and I cooked it in my oval LeCreuset Au Gratin so it looked wonderful. I will make it again. It was well received by the group I cook for every week. I found that 30 saltines = 1 cup of crumbs, so I just added it to 3 Tbs melted butter and 3 Tbs horseradish for the topping.

This is a family favorite. I think the sauce turns out better if you use a couple different cheeses. This time I used 1 3/4 c cheddar and 1/4 c feta and it was really good. I haven't found time to make the saltine topping yet. I just dust the top with fresh bread crumbs. I probably should try tossing those with butter first. In any case, it's a really great side dish. Oh, also, the cheese sauce makes a lot. I usually only use 3/4 of it.

I didn't have any horseradish on hand, so instead of using regular cheddar cheese I used a horseradish cheddar cheese. It was absolutely delicious. The horseradish flavor is not too overwhelming. Would like to try this again the same way but by adding the horseradish crumbs to the top (I used plain breadcrumbs).

the biggest hit of Thanksgiving dinner. I added 1/2 t of dijon mustard and a bit of nutmeg to the sauce. Terrific.

excellent, followed the recipe to the letter and it is outstanding. Like mac and cheese but with a veggie instead. I may try panko bread crumbs next time.

This is a great side dish with a turkey or a ham. The horseradish is the secret ingredient, giving it zing without overpowering the dish. Three forks up!

I don't love cauliflower, but this was good! The horseradish really adds some interest to an otherwise bland veggie. If I make this again, the only change I would make would be to make bread crumbs from a baguette instead of using saltines.

I wonder if adding in some brussels sprouts with the cauliflower would be tasty. Brussels and cheddar, yes, but not sure about brussels with the horseradish topping. Comments, anyone?

Our family owns a golf course and we decided to make this for our member/guest event. It was excellent - great for a large crowd. Everyone loved it and it was something different from the normal "club fare". This will probably go on our menu at the club not to mention a definite for family gatherings!

What a let down. This is the first recipe from Epicurious that I wasn't fond of. I LOVE horseradish, I would put it in my coffee if I thought it would be good, but this didn't work for me. This recipe did however, make a nice cheese sauce that I will use to make my cauliflower au gratin - No horseradish. Unless I use horseradish cheddar. Hmmm, now there's an idea.

This dish was a hit at our family Thanksgiving potluck.

Rating: 3
Even people who thought they don't like cauliflower asked for seconds on this dish. I used panko crumbs like a previous reviewer, just because it was easier, and the horseradish does 'kick this up a notch'. But the cheese sauce was delicious and not bland, with a generous dash of nutmeg (still very subtle in the sauce) and a tsp of dry mustard added. I left out the scallions in the sauce this time, used some dried chives instead mostly for color, but it's not necessary. This recipe is a keeper

Rating: 2
Unlike other reviewers, I liked the cheese sauce but felt that the topping didn't really add enough to be worth the extra calories. However, this could have been because I couldn't find saltines here in France and had to use matzos instead. These didn't crumble very well and made for quite a tasteless topping. I think I may try this again using salty biscuits or breadcrumbs for the topping, and more horseradish. I'm also going to break the cauliflower into slightly smaller florets so that the sauce clings to them a bit more. If all else fails I think I'll just use the sauce for macaroni and cheese.

I agree with DC cook - nothing special about this recipe. The horseradish made a big difference, though. Without it this would have been boring. Not a loser, but too full of calories to bother making again.

Very simple to put together - next time I might cook the cauliflower ahead. My 16-year-old said it was "really good"; I love my "gourmet" food as much as anyone, but I really enjoy comfort-food classics like this too. Will definitely be a household standard recipe for cauliflower!

I didn't have horseradish on hand but I did have some horseradish mayo. I put a big dollop of the mayo in both the cheese sauce and in the butter/crumb mix. A nice counterpoint to the natural blandess of the cauliflower.

Made this as a satisfying, low-carb alternative to a starch such as potatoes. My guests had seconds and thirds and raved. I used slightly more cheese in the sauce than called for, and increasing the amount of sauce next time would not go amiss. As a way to avoid last minute stress, I cooked the cauliflower the day before and then cooled it and stored it in the fridge. I left the florets on the large side and cooked the veg. until barely tender. I made the sauce earlier in the day that I served the dish, cooled the sauce a bit, and stirred it into the cauliflower and placed it in the buttered baking dish and back in the fridge. About an hour before I wanted to serve it, I let it come to room temp. I put it in the hot oven for about 25 minutes or so, at a lower heat (425) so it would cook through. Into the sauce I also added one T of extra horseradish, a pinch of nutmeg, and a t. of dry mustard. Sauce had good flavor without being overpoweringly spicy. I used good quality extras sharp cheddar that I hand grated; the cheese should be a standout here. I used the previously-recommended panko (Japanese) crumbs as my fish market happens to sell them ready made. I used about 3/4 cup of crumbs. Once mixed with the butter and horseradish I didn't use all the crumbs as some of us are watching carbs, but I wouldn't leave them out as they provide a little crunch on the finished dish. I also recommend using, as said below, a relatively shallow baking dish, mine is about a 9-10" oval, about 2 " high. That way you don't need a lot of crumbs. Served this as a side dish to poached salmon, and also with some good bread.

My family wasn't thrilled with this. It wasn't bad, just nothing special. A little cayenne, or more horseradish, might perk it up some, but I probably won't make it again.

OMG, this dish is fantastic and a snap to prepare. I've already made it three times in the past two weeks to rave reviews from everyone who's had it. Even cauliflower haters and young children loved it and requested that I make it again. It's even good with that horrible pre-shredded cheddar cheese in a bag (make sure it's sharp cheddar, and I'd cut back on the salt). I've made it as written and also w/ my own slight variation by using panko bread crumbs instead of saltines (around 3/4 to 1 cup of crumbs). I must admit, I do prefer the panko bread crumbs for both flavor and texture. A great weekday or company dish.

Very good. Next time I will try the make ahead and refrigerate idea because it did take more time than I thought. I also did not come out of the oven piping hot, so I will turn down the oven and take a little longer browning the cracker crumbs.

I made this recipe for a dinner party to accompany brisket and everyone raved about it. I actually made it a day ahead including putting the topping on it and put the casserole in the refrigerator. I brought it back to room temperature and reheated it for about 45 to an hour at 350 and then put it under the broiler for a few minutes.

I liked the fact that this recipe didn't call for any cream. I used non-fat milk and it worked out fine. Adding a little ham or bacon would also make it that much tastier.

It's excellent! Snowing the day I made it, so used yellow onion (about 1/2) and sauted in butter as not to overwhelm the cauliflower. Omitted horseradish, and added nutmeg...it was great, especially on a snowy night. Will make again for next dinner club.

My kids swore they didn't like cauliflower (and it's really not my favourite either), but they ended up fighting over this. Yes, it's just cauliflower and cheese sauce, but the horseradish crumbs make SUCH a difference. I think I'll make it again tomorrow!

Terrific dish!! "Exactly like mac and cheese"? Hardley. The addition of horseradish, crumbs, and scallions makes it a recipe of its own. I wouldn't change a thing. Great for a party or any special occassion.

I know why this is so popular! It is just like macaroni and cheese, only with cauliflower instead of the macaroni. The sauce is exactly the same (really! Check recipes for made-from-scratch mac and cheese!), only with some scallion greens added. Well, yes, and the horseradish crumbs are something new. Not a bad idea, it tastes quite good. However, I don't quite understand that somebody would want to make this dish for a festive occasion - it is certainly not very fancy.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. I used a combination of cheddar and gruyere, and it came out great, although the sauce seemed a little thick. I think I'll thin it out a bit more next time. This one's a keeper.

This was a great way to use the beautiful cauliflower I got at the farmer's market, also I used a little broccoli. I put the horseradish in with the cheese, instead of in the crumbs. Also I added garlic to the cheese mixture. It was a winner. My boyfriend does not like cauliflower, but ate this two days in a row!

My husband and I both found this delicious. I did make a couple of changes though. I used Whole wheat crackers and flour, and for the topping, I omitted the butter and kicked up the amount of horseradish. Yummy! Next time I will add horseradish and more cheese to the cheese sauce because I found it a little bland. Definetly a keeper.

Yummy dish! Definitely be careful not to overcook the cauliflower in the first step. I used the directed amount of bottled horseradish (not horseradish sauce), and the results were surprisingly mild. Using horseradish cheese instead, as another person did, would probably result in a much stronger horseradish flavor in the end.

This recipe is fast and so easy to make, and just was so delicious for the cauliflower! The ingredients added just the right amount of "OOMPH" to cauliflower, which can sometimes be bland! I used Ritz crackers for the topping instead of saltines! VERY GOOD!

Good overall, but technique is very important. The cauliflower must be very undercooked before and drained very well before baking, or the result will be a bland soupy mess. Also, baking in a shallow dish will yield better results. Breadcrumbs are fine in lieu of crackers. Adding some horseradish, mustard and cayenne to the gratin gives it a bit more zest.

I was wary, having made the other cauliflower horseradish gratin and really disliking it! This is really good, and easier, to boot. I made it for a potluck (I was more willing to test it on the teeming masses than my own family!), but it will definitely appear on our dinner table in the future. The contrast between the creamy cheesy cauliflower and the crunchy bite of the horseradish saltines is wonderful.

Finally, a recipe that adds some zip and flavor to the regularly bland cauliflower. Since making this for the first time, my wife has asked for it every week. The kids even love it. When's the last time you heard kids hoot with joy when they learn that they're having cauliflower with dinner?

I used a mild horseradish, and put in more than recommended. Next time I might use even more. My husband had 3 helpings, not bad for cauliflower. I also used a leek from my garden since I didn't have any scallions in the house. Might cheat on the sauce next time and make it in the microwave.
