I didn't have five-spice powder so instead made my own bouquet garni with a stick of cinnamon, about 1/2 tsp fennel seeds, 2 whole cloves, a bunch of multi-coloured peppercorns, and 2 whole star anise (I perhaps should have used just one). I let the soup cook on low for much longer that the recipe suggested to ensure the spices had properly seeped into the beets. The result was delicious  earthy (as others have said), spicy, and a beautiful colour. The only other adaptation I made was that I roasted the beets in the oven instead of cooking them in the broth. I don't know how much of a difference that made to the end result but there you have it.

I'm not sure I've ever tasted anything like this. Earthy beets, spicy ginger, sweet undertones, and then the blast of tang from the yogurt. The presentation is beautiful. I followed suit by upping the ginger and five-spice like the other reviewers, and was glad I did.

Loved this recipe. Made it exactly as directed, just added a bit more ginger to kick up the spice.

I thought this was just plain nasty. I followed the recipe to a tee, but the flavor is just flat and boring. Plus, I could not get the soup to be smooth...it was really thick and chunky no matter how much I blended it. I added more broth, but it just wasn't good. I'm sad that I wasted beets on it. Can't say that I'll ever try to make beet soup again.

The beets are so sweet when combined with the spices and the ginger adds a subtle undertone. One of my friends who was in the process of consuming the soup said that it tasted really "earthy". I agree, and on top of everything, the color is fantastic. Also, I roasted the beets individually wrapped in foil with a little bit of olive oil. They were wonderful and it was no trouble to heat up the 2 cups of stock that they would have microwaved in with the other cup when you're stewing all of the ingredients together. I would recommend that you try the soup first without the yogurt, as it detracted from the flavor with its own sourness.

I must say this soup is BEAUTIFUL! The bold color is unbelievable. The soup was a bit thick, even w/ addition broth added. Had a very earthy flavor. I thought the soup was good/delicious - but, not familiar to my palate though. May make it again, need to modify w/ more yogurt and spice.

Nice everyday soup, don't hesitate to put a little bit more ginger it give a nice taste. Didnt have the five-spices so I replaced it with ginger powdewr, chili powder, cinnamon and clove.

OMG this soup is amazing. Really really amazing. I upped the ginger and the five spice as other reviewers suggested and cooked the beets/broth on the stove for about 15 minutes instead of using the microwave. Topped with Greek yogurt. OMG so so so good. Can't wait to impress my foodie friends with this one.

I agree with adding more ginger and spices, I thought it tasted great. Slightly sweet and spicy, like an Indian dish. My kitchen looked like I had murdered someone after I was done with the beets.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made it for guests and they absolutely loved it. It's a wonderful fall/winter soup. It's hearty and delicious and the sour cream is a wonderful finish! Perfectly marvelous recipe!

I have made this soup several times. I roast the beets. I add at least twice as much chinese 5 spice than called for. I feel the dollop of plain yogurt is a must for this recipe. Great for a fall night and filling!

This soup is delicious, and SO easy. I usually add a spoonful of yogurt in the bowl as I serve it,for color and as a nice flavorful addition. It literally takes no time to prepare--remember, you don't even have to peel the beets.

Given the high ratings, my expectations were high for this dish. It's highly likely that the poor outcome was because of something I did, but I was sorely disappointed. Will not make this soup again.

Excellent and easy! I didn't have celery so I substituted a granny smith apple. I also did not have chinese 5-spice powder, so just made a mixture of ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Great flavors, color and consistency. I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I thought this was fabulous. I hadn't read the reviews yet but added extra ginger and five-spice powder. We'll certainly make it again!

this was ridiculously delicious. it absolutely needs about 3x the ginger the recipe calls for (A LOT), a great deal more of chinese five spice depending on your spice tolerance. the stuff is more savory than spicy so you can be liberal. it also uses a tiny bit of salt and just a splash of lemon juice. i would like to thank my amazing boyfriend ben fischer whom i want to marry for being my personal chef and making this way better than any silly recipe..

We kept thinning the soup as it turned out so thick. We both love beets but this was just not that interesting. We both said we'd rather have a borscht next time.

This was a great weeknight, low cal meal...my husband LOVED it. I would probably use a little more fresh ginger and 5-spice powder next time. It had a good kick, but could use some more.

Excellent soup. Next time I will roast the beets for better flavor. Definitely use more 5-Spice Powder than the recipe calls for.

this was delicious. i'll definitely make it again. i don't have a microwave; i instead roasted the beets in a 400F oven until tender. i then sauteed the onion and celery, added the ginger and 5-spice, then the beets and broth. at first i wasn't sure i wanted to puree the soup, but ultimately did and realize it is certainly done this way for a reason-- it really makes the flavors explode. added more broth, a little more ginger and 5-spice than the recipe said. it was a very, very thick soup, even with my extra added broth. ate with whole milk greek yogurt mixed in.

First of all, I hope Epicurious will find and delete the advertisement that is the first review of this recipe. They don't even have a beet soup on that site! I think this recipe has potential, but beets boiled in anything are not as flavorful as they could be. I'd like to figure out a way to make this with roasted beets. Also, the ginger and five spice were not recognizable in the recipe. I'd up the quantity a bit. The texture reminds me of butternut squash soup. OK, I'll share my favorte Epicurious link to that here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Butternut-Squash-Soup-with-Ginger-15572 I'll make this again but with changes.
