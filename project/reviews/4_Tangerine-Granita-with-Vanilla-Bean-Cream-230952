my granita curdled my vanilla bean cream... other than that, it was pretty tasty. Anyone know how to prevent the curdling from happening next time? Thanks

I loved the vanilla cream and the granita was refreshing, but for some reason the tangerine left a bitter aftertaste. I also made some strawberry granita (with 1 pound strawberries, 1/2 cup sugar, some lemon juice and a cup of water) and served the two kinds of granita on the bed of cream. It looked awesome and tasted wonderful!!!

L-O-V-E'd this! Didn't have vanilla bean so used some Aztec vanilla I had and it was just as good.

I love this creamsicle dessert! My only recommendation is to reduce the sugar. I used a madagascar vanilla bean and 1 T. of sugar (instead of 2) in the cream. The vanilla bean was strong enough that I added more cream to the mix. For the tangerine part of the recipe, if you have sweet tangerines, you only need 1/4 cup or even no sugar. The fruit carries itself. My freezer wasn't big enough for a square baking pan, so I ended up processing it in my ice cream maker, which worked really well.

I had this at a friend's house and thought it was wonderful. A previous reviewer is correct. It does taste like a dreamsicle. The texture combination of the cream and ice flakes is great. I remember she told me she used purchased tangerine juice. I am happy to have found the recipe and will make it for my next dinner party. Can't wait to make it.

I made this when it appeared in the Oct. issue of Bon Appetit and it is FABULOUS. The name is wrong:in the magazine it is called tangeriine granita with vanilla cream, so it's the web sites fault.

Canada reviewer, While I do not like reading reviews where the reviewer has changed everything then rates the recipe, this is, sometimes, the only place to ask a question about something confusing in a recipe or ask about alternatives. We're not ALL gourmets. Some of us are learning.

It looks like it was given the wrong title. I made it exactly as written and it DOES taste good, like a "creamsicle". It's just an orange granita with a vanilla sauce :-)

Why are more and more people commenting about recipes that they have never tried. The purpose of rating the recipe is to try it and rate it so that others can decide, by the comments, if it is worthwhile. This is not a chat room so please respect the site and the reason that it is here for the true gourmets among us!!!!

Looks from the photo to be just cream. Could be good though, I'll try it.

How do you get Ice Cream from the cream mixture by merely refrigerating it for a few hours? Or did I miss something?
