Okay, I know the reviewer from Washington DC will probably never look at this recipe again, but I just have to say this: The heading of the recipe says that this can be made in 45 minutes OR LESS. It's from a regular column in Gourmet called "In Short Order." If you want to quibble with the idea that a quick recipe takes 45 minutes, go ahead.

Next time I'll use lime juice instead of lemon juice. Actual cooking time is closer to 5 or 6 minutes to bring out the "sweet" taste in the sweet potatoes. I also added a teaspoon of peanut oil at the end.

I think this recipe is misleading: the prep time is listed at 45 minutes but shredding the potatoes and cooking them 3 minutes only doesn't follow. The potatoes must be cooked until somewhat tender at the very least, the scallions added at the end and frankly, the whole thing cries out for a sauce. This is a possibility as a bed for a southwestern dish.

I thought that the potato would brown but they stayed bright orange and crisp-ish
