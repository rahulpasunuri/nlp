After reading complaints that the dish was kind of bland, I decided to add a slivered Serrano chile to the piperade, eliminate the blah yellow peppers, and add red pepper flakes to the fish marinade. I also used much less olive oil - 2 tsp for the piperade and 1 tsp for the fish marinade. The result: A very tasty dish. I would definitely make it this way again.

After reading reviews saying it was bland I added some cajun seasoning and a little smoky chipolte hot sauce. It was delicious.

The peppers as a bed for the fish were fine, but the fish was bland.

This was very good--halibut can be rather bland sometimes and the piperade was a simple accompaniment that really livened it up. I'll make this one again!

Not sure why everyone but me thinks this is so great. It is simple to prepare, probably relatively non-fattening but rather blah in my book. Try Sauteed Halibut with Pecan Butter Topping for more bang for your buck.

I LOVED this recipe - delicious! And my husband, who generally hates peppers and isn't too wild about fish, inhaled it! I was short on time to prepare it, so the only change I made was picking up fajita mix (pre-sliced red, green, yellow and orange peppers, red onions and carrots) from the local Gelson's market - it worked just fine. I had to use dried basil, too since I didn't have any fresh on hand, and that was fine also. The fish was moist and flavorful and the pepper mix was really yummy. This is going to become a staple recipe for me - its definitely a keeper!

this was wonderful! I have to say, though, that we took this recipe in a different direction than it was intended. I was in the middle of making it when my husband decided he was in the mood for a cream sauce and a chardonnay. With fresh fish on my hands and the already julienned peppers, he was out of luck...then we thought of how we could make it work. We added mushrooms to the peppers, piled them high on some fettuccini pasta, topped with the fish and then some alfredo sauce. It was a far cry from the healthful meal we had started with, but it was soooo yummy! The peppers and the fish were done to perfection!

A wonderful and easy dish to prepare and serve. Terrific taste and color. I didn't change a thing to the recipe, but used wine instead of chicken broth.

I don't usually like halibut because it has usually been too dry. This recipe imbues a wonderful moist consistency to the fish and the sauce... just great.

An outstanding recipe! One of the best seafood dishes I have ever prepared at home.

A thunderstorm changed my plan from a grilled halibut to this recipe, and what a treat! I followed the recipe, pretty much, except that I had some leeks to use up, so I subsituted those for the red onion. The piperade bed, with the fresh herbs, garlic, and lemon marinade was very tasty and nicely infused the halibut. Considering the initial advice, I was surprised that the recipe called for no wine or broth, just a suggestion to add some if needed. I added about a half cup of chicken broth, and that seemed enough to keep the fish deliciously moist. This dish presents very well, especially with the tri-color of peppers that I used and the garnish of fresh parsley. I would not hesitate to do this one again for company. My piece of fish was about a pound and a half, and there were enough vegetables to provide a "bed" for each of four pieces.
