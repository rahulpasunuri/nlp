A very good gazpacho. Very refreshing, if anything, it could have a bit more of a bite to it.

I've made gazpacho many times with a similar recipe, but with one key difference: NO food processor! It's a matter of preference, of course, but I like the texture of vegetables that are chopped rather than processed.

I made this for a dinner party and it was fabulous. I did cut back the wine vinegar by about half and used less onion (mild white) per prior reviews and made it the night before the party. It couldn't have been better.

I have made this twice and have received rave reviews from all who tasted it. I kept everything pretty close to the recipe, though I added a little more cayenne to make it spicier. This is a classic that I will return to time and again.

Way too much onion and red wine vinegar. While it hasn't finished chilling I'm really disappointed. I used a red onion.,,, wondering if that changed the flavor? Wish I could find my old Moosewood cookbook recipe that has fresh pineapple in it. That was a winner. Not sure how to save this current batch.
