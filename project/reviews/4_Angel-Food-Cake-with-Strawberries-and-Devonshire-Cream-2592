Cook from Edmonton. I lived in Edmonton and understand why you think less cream of tartar. It is SO dry in Edmonton. I now live in Toronto. I bet Toronto and England both call for more tartar cuz of the humidity. I think the recipe is right in that sense. Nothing rises in Toronto/England.

The type of pan needed was confusing. It calls for an angel food cake pan aka a bundt pan or tube pan! It uses many eggs and it tasted great!

I made this for Valentine's day, and boy did it pay off! Having not made angel food cake for over five years, it was easy to follow, and fun. I used fresh whipped cream and straberries as a layer and topping w/melted chocolate. A looker too!

This is a great Angel Food Cake, but calls for too much cream of tartar. I made it again with 1 1/4 teaspoons and tasted MUCH better.

Excellent texture and very, very moist. However, I preferred the taste of the other angel food cake recipe I found here at Epicurious, hence the 3 forks, not 4. If I had not tasted the one before, this one would definitely have been the best angel food cake I've ever had.

The cake was good, but turned out flat on top, not puffy like my mom used to make. I don't know what I did wrong, since I followed the recipe exactly. I only make these for my brother, so until it's his birthday again, I won't make again.

Simply delicious! Imperative to use a tube pan with a bottom that can be removed, and it also is a good idea to put a ring of parchment at the bottom. I also found that it only needed 40mins exactly of cooking time. The best angel food cake I have ever eaten...moist with perfect texture.

Simply fabulous! The cake is wonderful and the Devonshire Cream is a great touch. A word of warning though...don't expect any leftovers! My nephews each had three pieces and asked for the cake for their birthdays. The only modification I made was to use a low-fat sour cream and it was just fine. This is a winner.

This is a great angel food cake. I think that it includes a bit more egg whites to the amount of flour than most AFC recipes, hence it's very moist. I baked my cake exactly 40 minutes and that was plenty of time. Delicious!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! You'll never use a mix again for angel food. I added 2 T grated orange rind & 1 tsp orange juice to cake batter. Then topped with Orange Glaze...soooo good.

This cake is the lightest angel food I've ever eaten. It turns out wonderfully, and is a cinch to make. And the devonshire cream is the perfect complement to the sweet strawberries. I can't believe I've eaten angel food cake any other way!
