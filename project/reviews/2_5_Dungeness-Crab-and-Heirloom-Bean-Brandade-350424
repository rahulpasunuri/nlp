It made a great appetizer for our Thanksgiving! No leftovers here! Shelled my own fresh crab (more affordable) for approx. 12 oz. To boost the flavor, added 1/2c. flaked minced salt cod that had been soaked and simmered. Used fresh local cream cheese, and more sharp cheddar than was called for. Try topping with paprika.

To the reviewer from Key West - the recipe didn't call for pig trotters either... This is however one of those dartboard recipes (throw the dart at any list of ingredients). Sad.

Perhaps it's the fact that there are no heirloom tomatoes in the heirloom tomato bean brandade.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. Way too bland for the time, trouble, and expense involved, and the taste of the crab itself was too muted. I added some Adobe sauce from a can of Chipotle Peppers in Adobe to try to give the dish more depth and heat, which helped some... but not enough. There are much better crab appetizer recipes out there. I won't be making this one again.

I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewers -- I made this for a cocktail party and the dish was cleaned out by the end of the night. It's got a more subtle (and heartier) flavor than a straight-up crab/cheese dip, which might put some people off. I too used Great Northern beans (not a problem here) and substituted lump crabmeat for the harder-to-find Dungeness.

The flavors of the yummy and very expensive ingredients such as the crab and the cheese were overwhelmed by the bean flavor. I could not find marrow beans even at Whole Foods so I substituted Great Northern and maybe that was the problem. I served it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and it was hardly touched. Very disappointing.

Oops! The correct spelling is dungeness. Living here in the Northwest, we see the word everyday!
