I used fresh shiitakes and no seaweed. Easy, fast and healthy.

Easy to make, tasted great. I agree with the other reviews, modify ingredients to taste. I used fresh shitake, doubled scallions. It was delicious!

This was a really easy, simple side dish. I used low sodium soy sauce, no seaweed, fresh thinly sliced shiitake (instead of dried), and doubled the scallions. Also, I served it with fish that had a white wine sauce accompanying it, so the rice soaked up some of the sauce. Very nice.

A simple and delicious way to enjoy rice. The amount of mushrooms, shoyu, salt, and scallions can be adjusted to your liking.

I used low sodium soy sauce and added button mushrooms in addition to the shitake. Everyone that tried it loved it!

I'm a big fan of Anita Lo, so I was psyched to try this. I made the mistake of making this in a rice cooker--however, regardless of how I made it, it is really high on salt. Next time I would leave out the teaspoon of salt altogether. I am going to try again on the stovetop.
