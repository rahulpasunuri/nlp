I tried reducing the confectioner's sugare to 1/2 cup, and using green olives with pimento. They were less sweet, more tart and salty, and quite good with alcoholic beverages.

THESE THINGS ARE NOT SOOOOOOO BAD BUT THEY ARE NOT GOOD EITHER. I WOULD NEVER MAKE THEM AGAIN.(TRY ADDING SOME HONEY FOR SWEETNING...)

I made 300 of these for a Rotary Club fund raiser. It is called the Olive and Jazz festival and takes place in Los Olivos, CA. They have about 20 "O Chefs" that must make something with olives or olive oil and the public pays to come and taste the food and also wine. Each year there is a winner and I won last year with this recipe. It is outstanding. The chef from the local Italian restaurant keeps asking for the recipe. I will give it to him soon. I will be making these again at the end of the week for this years festival. I sprinkle grey sea salt on them when they come out of the oven.

I love olives with a passion, and I am always willing to try new things, so I really looked forward to making these. I fell in love with them. My roomates were very sceptical but once they tried them they were addicted! They would not stop eating them.

I love all olives so this recipe appealed to me. We were disappointed and won't try it again.

This is a do again recipe. I have prepared these days in advance of a party and frozen them. They lose nothing from the defrosting.

This is a very interesting cookie. Take care not to let them brown very much. The edges should be liightly browned but the center shouldn't take on much color at all. The darker they get the more bitter they become. Probably a 7-10 min. baking time is more realistic. Also, instead of rolling them out I formed the dough into a log and refrigerated it overnight. Then I was able to cut them in slices with no trouble at all. I baked them on heavy teflon pans with no parchment. A very good recipe, worth making again.

This is supposed to be an appetizer, but is actually sweet and tastes like a cookie with olives in it.
