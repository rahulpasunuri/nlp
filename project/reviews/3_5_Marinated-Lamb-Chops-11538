I used this recipe for lamb loin chops, and my husband gave it the coveted "thumbs up". After marinating, I seared the chops and roasted them in the oven @ 375. Next time, I'll lower the temp, and roast them a little slower. I served them with the white bean recipe on this site that is paired with lamb shanks. Also delicious!

i cant believe how well this recipe turned out. I broiled for longer than 7 minutes and still chops turned out juicy and flavorful. I was so pleasantly surprised!!! definitely worth trying for a quick weeknight meal.

Quite tasty. This recipe could not be any easier. A great recipe to fall back on when you don't have a lot of time.

Simple and really quite delicious..who could ask for anything more? This is as close to a perfect marinade for lamb that I have ever come across. Cooking time was a little off (we have a gas grill) they were perfect for me (medium rare to rare) but too pink for my husband. Gas grill users might need to adjust the cooking time somewhat. We prepared this to celebrate the coming of Spring in beautiful Nashville after a long unusually cold winter (we are rushing it a bit!). Next time we have this wonderful dish we will not need the sweaters and blankets. A real keeper..thanks Epicurious! This web site is a cooks dream come true.

This is an incredibly easy dish to prepare. It is great for two on a weeknight or for a last minute get together with friends. Marinating it for a few hours really helps.

Nice and easy recipe! I marinaded the lamb overnight in the fridge.

I thought the recipe needed rosemary, and marinated overnight. I grilled them and served with a mushroom risoto and leeks a la grecque
