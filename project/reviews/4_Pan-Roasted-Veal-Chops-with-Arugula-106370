i thought this was quite good...i used a sprinkling of alder smoked sea salt mixed with pink sea salt...the smokiness added a certain depth. i also had some extra sauteed mushrooms, and tossed them in when i deglazed the pan....an earthy addition...i also like arugula wilted, so i tossed in the hot pan....the chops were thick, got a great crust on the sear, and came out incredibly moist and flavorful...given they were $35/lb, if they were anything less than stellar i would have been annoyed...served with creamy polenta with smoked cheddar, and the starter was a wild mushroom soup....all in all a very satisfying meal.

Overall it was good but not enough for me to save this recipe. The best part is the arugula with the garlic sauce.

Great recipe! I just made it for dinner tonight. Instead of making the dressing separately, I added everything to the pan sauce step. After plating the veal chops and sauce, I added arugula to the pan and tossed with the remaining pan sauce. It was fabulous!! The best part beside it tasted so good -it was very quick and easy to make.

I have added this recipe to my repetoire. It is simply devine. I have made no adjustments as I usually do to recipes and it always turns out perfect. Definitely a keeper. Thank you.

This is one of the best meals we've had. I've been making this for about 3 years now and it gets RAVE reviews every single time. The arugula with the garlic is a perfect match. The veal rib chops are the most tender cut - just melts in your mouth.We usually have this with small roasted potatoes.

This recipe is exceptional. I served it for a special evening with another couple and we all loved it. I made no changes in the recipe at all. The chops were marvelous and the arugula was perfect with them. I served the chops and arugula with garlic mashed potatoes.

Super yummy and super easy! Will definately make again.

Delicious. I made this recipe exactly as it says but I sprinkled a little allspice on the veal before searing (saw it in a different veal recipe). The added flavor was great! I would definitely make it again.

Yes- don't cook for 15 mins. I bought expensive "porterhouse" veal chops which are big and I thought they're so thick they'll need 15 mins but they dried out so I'm guessing 8 or 10 at very most is sufficient- just check them after 5 mins. but a very nice recipe- will make again. The arugula salad everyone loved and t needed a little more dressing for the 2 big bunches I had so will dbl the dressing next time. Had this recipe with the asparagus/shitake risotto and turned out to be substantial a meal for the 3 men I have to feed. Will make again.

My husband just loved this. I served it with celery risotto. Had baby spinach on hand, so used it instead of arugula.

This is one of the most mouth-watering dishes we've ever had. Follow the recipe, it's wonderful. The veal rib chops are tender, juicy, the "sauce" is delicious with the arugula.

I do catering and teach cooking classes, and this is a big hit in class. This is a quick and easy recipe that tastes like you spent hours making it. I usually serve it on any goumet type greens I have available. Mesculin greens are my favorite. I also serve a lemon rice pilaf with this. If you're really in a hurry, you can use an instant lemon rice mix (just don't tell anyone)! BYW, the profchef is right, never cook anything to the temperature a recipe states--you'll kill it. Also, this veal chop turned my husband into a fan. He said he never had a veal chop he liked until this one.

Truly outstanding and so very simple. I added some leftover sauted mushrooms.

Truly excellent! I made this for my family and everyone loved it. I got rave reviews. Thank you to the prof. chef from Cambridge, MA for the tip on cooking the veal chops. I followed this advice and was very happy with the result.

This was OUTSTANDING. I divided the whole recipe in half to make 2 servings. For my half recipe I used 3 oz. (by weight) of fresh spinach, instead of arugula. The salad was too pungent, so I added a chopped avocado, and then it was delicious. I used super lean boneless pork sirloin chops (instead of veal), seared the meat as directed, and then put it into an oven-proof bowl (with about 1/2 of the skillet juices) and baked it, covered, at 325 degrees. While baking the meat, I made the sauce in the vacated skillet. At the very end I added the meat and any juices back into the skillet, and thickened the juice with a cornstarch/water mixture before adding the butter. Served this with leftover "Bell Pepper And Rice Pilaf" (also on this site), and it was a meal to die for!! My husband could not stop complimenting me.

This is an amazing dish. I can't wait to make it again!

to the cook whose chops were tough: recipes often recommend that you drastically overcook your meat. no veal should ever be cooked to 155. try 130-135 next time, and let it rest. hope that helps!

This is a fantastic veal chop recipe. Made as directed. The arugula and the veal are a great combination. Served with a South African Pinotage. Yummy.

So easy and extremely tasty. I, too, usually grill my veal chops so this was a welcome change. Didn't do arugula (mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and steamed spinach as sides), so I didn't bother with garlic paste and just used minced garlic with the shallots. If you are serving with potatoes, rice, or polenta, I suggest doubling the sauce. It doesn't take long at all to reduce. We will be eating this all of the time.

This was very tasty but am I the only one who ended up with tough veal chops? Did I do something wrong? Used very large rib chops ($$$) - should I have used loin chops? These were quite thick and I followed the directions - 3 min. on each side - then in the oven - help to all you experts out there!

Made this last night and my husband and I both agree it is one of the best meals we have had in a while, at home or out. I served the chops with roasted potatoes and broiled tomatoes. Definitely make this easy recipe!

Veal chops are great pan fried! (I usually grill them). This recipe is perfect for a gourmet dinner at home.

"Remaining" garlic paste? What happened to the first half?

This was as good as you would get at any fine restaurant! I made it for Valentines Day and it was a smash! I searved garlic mashed potatoes along side. Very good!

WOW! This is an easy but excellent dish. I accidentally used a good Sherry Wine Vinegar instead of Balsamic vinegar, and doubled the garlic. To save time, I used bagged Arugula which was just perfect with the veal. I also paired the dish with Macaroni and Cheese with Prosciutto (on this site) and my husband rated the entire meal "two thumbs up." Will make again soon.

This was very tasty, arugula with veal is a classic pairing, but very time consuming. We served it with garlic mashed potatoes

Great dish. The veal chops and the arugula have great flavor together. I found the chops actually cooking more quickly than expected, but the temperature probe kept me on course. I served this for friends with the roasted cherry tomatoes on the side. The asparagus with tarragon vinaigrette was a very nice first course. I splurged for white asparagus which is a worthy indulgence.

Smiply great and full of flavor...I had to leave the chops a bit longer in the oven before reaching 155...but it was well worth the wait...I served the chops with roasted new potatoes and roasted asparagus...simply elegant

Delicious!!! The veal chop and the sauce were absolutely amazing! Meat thermometers are necessary, as one of my chops was far thicker than the other. I skipped the arugula and opted for a fava bean salad instead, and served it all with baked macaroni and cheese. I also cooked the veal to medium rare instead of medium. My husband and I ate every bite. I will make this recipe again and again. Truly, truly delicious.
