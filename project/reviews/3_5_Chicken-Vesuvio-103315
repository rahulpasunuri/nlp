I used skin on, bone in chicken breasts and b/4 frying the potatoes deglazed the pan with a little more EVOO and sliced onion. Added chicken broth near the end as I didn't want it to dry out and a little lemon juice when served. It was quite good. Will make again.

When done right, this can be unbelievable! I will have to try again to nail down reliable cooking times, (I ended up pulling out the chicken and cooking the potatoes extra b/c they weren't quite done yet. TIPS: Mix a TBSP or so of Smoked Paprika in with the flour before coating the chicken in it. I also used skin-on/bone in breasts. When I was going to bake everything and add the wine, I also added a few pinches of season salt and cayenne pepper to give just a touch of heat. For Wine, I used some Pacific Rim - Chenin Blanc, which was not only perfect for the dish, but very enjoyable to accompany the cooking process... Cheers!

This was very easy to make and delicious! I used a chardonnay instead of a dry white, which I thought gave this a little more tangy flavor. I think a good quality olive oil also makes the difference--I used a golden/sweeter oil from Spain.

I sauteed the chicken and potatoes in olive oil rather than deep frying. I also added onions, which some other folks did. I will make this again as it was very good.

I love this recipe on a cold day - perfect comfort food. However, to make it healthier, I pan fry the potatoes and chicken in about 3-4 tablespoons of oil rather than deep frying them in them 2 cups of oil, and I still pour off any excess. It tastes great - the garlic and wine are key.

by far one of the best cxhicken dishes i have ever made, i changed it slightly to add depth, i semi fried the potato then deglazed with wine and onions and added the potatos back, added the garlic and simmered to the potato was a bit softer, i also added a slight bit of mustard and added the herbs now not with the flour for the chicken, i served it with beans with provencale tomatoe. it was changed but worth it

I did not find that this dish was worth the effort. It tasted good but was not as extraordianry as I had hoped. It was spicy, which I usually lik ebut aside from that it was kind of blah.

The family loved it. I liked the taste of the chicken with the wine. As a whole, is seems a bit to oily for my taste.

I tried the recipe that called for 3 TBS of oil. It is fantastic!! I have made it countless times with extra garlic cloves because they taste so good after being baked!

certainly not a "bad" recipe, but to our taste, it just wasn't particularly interesting.

Couldn't find a vesuvio recipe in any of my Marcella Hazan cookbooks, so I opted for Epicurious. Of the two chicken vesuvio recipes, I decided to make the Gourmet version because the Bon Apetit entry contained garlic powder. To my dismay, I was out of dried rosemary leaves, but added fresh ones to the frying oil, and it seemed to be fine. I also added two tsps. of crushed red pepper with the garlic (two heads worth of cloves). Rather than finish this in the oven, I fried the chicken and the potatoes in a 6-quart Calphalon pan, and when everything was assembled for the oven, I placed the pan on my gas grill with oak chips for smoking. Also upped the wine amount to a cup and a half. I basted the chicken and potatoes, but would not if I wanted a crisper finish. Definitely a restaurant-quality dish. My wife adored it.

Wonderful recipie. Sauce is wonderful. I had to broil the dish for about five minutes at the end to crisp the chicken.

This is one of my wife's favourite meals...I make it for her for special occasions. This dish is truly proof that you can fry anything in olive oil and it will taste great...DR

There are two recipies in Epicurious of this dish. We tried the one with the photo. Too bad I didn't find that out until after I tried the one with 2 CUPS of oil! What a greasy, oily disaster and I cut it down some. I might try the recipie calling for 3 Tablespoons of oil, but then again, I might NOT

This was very good. I poured almost all of the oil out of the pan at the end (before adding the wine).

This was outrageous. Such a simple recipe and such great sauce.

This recipe was great. I used more wine as it made a delicious sauce.
