This is very nice! The orange aroma as it's "baking" is lovely -- somehow this oil smells like Christmas and like summer at the same time. This makes a lovely gift for a cook. I put a small sprig of fresh rosemary in each of the glass jars of the oil I made, once it had cooled down a bit. Great for salad dressings, marinades, or for basting fish, chicken or pork as it's grilling.
