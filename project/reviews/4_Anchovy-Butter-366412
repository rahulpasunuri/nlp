This recipe is definately a keeper. The flavor took me in my mind straight to the table of gourmet restaurant. Super easy, extremely delicious. I cooked the butter on the grill in a metal bowl. I substitued lime juice and some thyme. You can't go wrong with this receipe. I used it on my steak and apsaragus. My kids even liked it!

I have also added fresh rosemary to the butter and stuffed in a pocket of filet mignon. Yummy.

The first time I made this it was mostly out of curiosity, my husband and I were blown away. I've made it several times since (always to recipe) and each time it's been fantastic.

This is a totally exceptional butter to make. I used it on a rare rib eye steak and it made the flavor pop. The balance of the salty fish and the fresh lemon was interesting and did not overwhelm the flavor of the meat. When seasoning your cut I recommend going easy on any salt prior to cooking, as the anchovy butter is quite salty on its own.
