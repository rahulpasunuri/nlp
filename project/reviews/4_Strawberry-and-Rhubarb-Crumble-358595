This is a classic, simple crisp with a very crunchy topping and a pleasingly sweet-tart fruit base. I was a bit concerned that the hazelnut flavor would be overpowering, but it blended in nicely. I recommend cutting the sugar on the fruit to about 1/3 cup.

This was an ok recipe, but nothing great. The filling was very soupy. I thought the strawberries and rhubarb I used were pretty good, but the filling flavor was a little mild. And I've had other crumble toppings which came out better than this one.

Very very delicious and easy to make. the only thing I did differently was reduce the sugar for both the filling and the topping and it's still sweet enough for me. I also used a mixture of nuts...almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts to the top. The only gripe I have is that I have no idea what 12 ounces of rhubarb looks like, so I guesstimated and used 3 stalks. Perhaps this should be measured out in cups rather than ounces.

just had to leave the kitchen so it could be hidden from me. i would have eaten the whoe thing before guests arrived. this is the perfect combination of sweet and tart. i initally hesitated at the cost of rhubarb here but am glad i splurged. my guests will love it!

Grew up in England and visit often and no crumble would have oats included. This is an American version. I like the rhubarb/strawberry combination but just use a flour/sugar/butter combination for the topping.

Excellent! I took it to a potluck and everyone raved about it. A little too sweet for my taste, but I had also used a little less rhubarb than what recipe called for.

Delicious and simple! We have a nut/peanut allergy so I ommitted the nuts and used 1 cup of oats. i didn't have rhubarb, but the texture was fine with extra strawberries. The crumble was perfect!

This recipe is so easy, flexible, and delicious. I've made it several times- once omitting hazelnuts, once substituting pecans, once with blueberries and blackberries. It doesn't even need a creamy topping but I served it once with mascarpone whipped cream- which was a hit.

YUM. I didn't have hazelnuts but discovered that toasted chopped walnuts were exellent in the topping. Cornstarch and vanilla extract in the fruit mixture also worked well as other reviewers suggested. Husband loved this with vanilla ice cream.

So easy and delicious! A quick alternative to strawberry rubarb pie. All of the flavour with a fraction of the work!

I just made this crumble this afternoon with my son, and it was so easy yet so scrumptious! The strawberry/rhubarb flavor really came through. I added cinnamon to the crust mixture and also added 1 tablespoon of corn starch to the fruit mixture and it really helped the flavor and the consistency. If it was an option, I would have given this dessert 3 1/2 stars.

Yummy! I belong to a CSA and was very excited to get rhubarb this week. I did not have hazelnuts, so I used chopped walnuts. I did not have vanilla bean, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and I used slightly less sugar on the fruit. I think next time I would add in 1-2 Tablespoons of flour into the fruit, mine was pretty runny. Also I baked it in a deep dish pie plate and it was very pretty. Can't wait for more rhubarb, this recipe is a keeper!

DELICIOUS! I had some strawberries that were a little overripe and a fresh stalk of rhubarb from the farmers market but I didn't have hazelnuts so I substituted sauteed and salted pecans I had from a previous recipe stowed away in the freezer. The topping is as wonderful as is the filing. I especially enjoyed the aesthetics of the tiny vanilla specks in the rich red filling. My first experience with rhubarb... definitely not the last! Really quick and easy! Looks great in individual serving dishes too!

I made this for Mother's day dinner this year. My two granddaughters, ages 5 and 2, loved it. My sister and I were very pleased with the topping for this crumble. In our family, peach cobbler is a favorite summer dessert. My sister is going to replace the traditional crumble topping with this one when she makes her next peach cobbler.

Fantastic! I used 1 lb rhubarb and probably more than 1 lb strawberries. The fruit was very juicy and so I added around 1/4 cup flour to sop it up. Maybe cornstarch would work better. I also reduce the sugar that went with the fruit to around 1/4 cup. The sweetness was perfect.

I followed a suggestion from the comments and made half the topping recipe, which was plenty; I also used toasted pecans instead of hazelnuts. It was DELICIOUS. I suspect the incredibly fresh strawberries and rhubarb I was lucky enough to find at the farmer's market helped, but I have never gotten so many compliments on a dessert! This is absolutely amazing, try it!

QUESTION: "12 ounces rhubarb, ends trimmed, stalks cut"? Do they mean chopped into one inch pieces?

I did not find this too sweet, in fact mine was a tad bit tart but good. I weighed out the rhubarb exactly with a kitchen scale. I made it for my dad's birthday; he's a big rhubarb fan and he really liked it.

I forgot the cardinal rule for many dessert recipes on this site -- cut the sugar by half. This was way too sweet. You couldn't taste the rhubarb at all. It was like white sugary jam or syrup. There wasn't enough topping and it was dry and powdery, couldn't taste the oats. While I like the idea of a strawberry rhubarb crumble, this recipe would not be the one I make.

Wonderful balance of flavors. Made homemade cinnamon ice cream and got rave reviews. Substituted pecans for hazelnuts. Had a lot of liquid--will try to add a bit of tapioca starch or corn starch next time

Rhubarb wasn't in season so I substituted blueberries and raspberries. I used just 1/4 cup sugar with the fruit and it seemed to be plenty. Very easy, will be making this again!

Wonderful! I served it at a dinner party tonight, and it was a big hit. I used pecans instead of hazelnuts, and they worked great; the nuts and oats provide a wonderful texture to the dish. Excellent with vanilla bean ice cream. A great way to inaugurate rhubarb season!

Been asked by my family to amend my "too sweet" review -- I found it too sweet for sure, but nobody else did!

Too sweet! Otherwise a good basic crumble - like others, I substituted pecans for the hazelnuts, and vanilla extract for vanilla bean, making it an extremely easy recipe. But I recommend you reduce the sugar....

Wonderful recipe! I used perfectly sweet strawberries I picked up from the farmers market, and I picked up rhubarb from my local grocery store. I halved the recipe and divided it among 4 ramekins to make individual servings. I followed the recipe, but I used almonds instead of hazelnuts. Topped it off with some Haagen Dazs Vanilla ice cream. Everything from the aroma as it came out of the oven down to the very last bite was heavenly! My guests and I thought it was absolutely divine. Make this recipe!

This recipe captures the right ratio of ingredients. As an aside, why on earth would one supply a recipe with an ingredient of "12 ounces" of rhubarb? That is a ridiculous measure unless you happen to have a kitchen scale next to the rhubarb patch (not to mention those of us using the metric system have no idea what 12oz looks like). I used 4 large stalks of rhubarb (probably more than 12oz) but enjoy the tartness of rhubarb. I also recommend adding 1 tbsp cornstarch to the sugar/fruit mixture.

I would double the crumble portion next time. Also substituted vanilla extract for bean.

Absolutely delicious. I cooked it for one hour as the topping wasn't brown after 45 minutes. I think the toasted hazelnuts are an essential part of the crumble (15 minutes in a 350 degree oven). I cooked it in the afternoon and reheated it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes after dinner. Guests loved it.

A winner on top of vanilla ice cream. We used walnuts instead of hazelnuts and just used liquid vanilla rather than the vanilla bean. Delicious!

Delicious, simple. So much easier and more tasty than pie. Used almonds as I had not hazelnuts. Fabulous with ice cream.

Substituted pecans for hazelnuts and sucanat for regular sugar. Just the right balance of sweet and tart, crust was crunchy (the way I like it). Even my son who does not like strawberries and my husband who does not like rhubarb loved it.

This came out perfect. I used Splenda on the fresh fruit and real sugar in the topping. I didn't have any hazelnuts so substituted toasted slivered almonds. This is as good for breakfast with some yogurt on top as it is with ice cream for dessert.

Delicious! I used toasted pecans instead of hazelnuts. I added 1-12 oz. pkge frozen rhubarb, defrosted, to the 12 ozs. fresh rhubarb. I used a 9 x 13" baking dish and increased cooking time to 55 minutes. It got rave reviews from guests --- served warm and freshly baked.

Loved this recipe. So much easier than a pie! You could double the fruit part of the recipe and cook in a 9x13. Just leave extra time for baking. Will definately make again!

I loved this recipe! The topping came out perfect and crunchy. I had to substitue walnuts because the commissary over here doesn't carry hazlenuts but they worked just fine in my opinion. A great go-to recipe that could be interchangable with just about any berry out there.

The flavors and textures blended perfectly together....crispy, velvety, smooth, not too sweet and just slightly tart. It was divine without the ice cream but even better with. I thought I didn't like rhubarb but it sparkles in this recipe.

Delicious. I used sliced almonds in the crumble, but otherwise followed exactly. Mine came out very liquidy, so next time I think I will try tossing the fruit with a little King Arthur's pie filling thickener. I have some and it works great.

Made this tonight and really enjoyed it. I made individual ramekins instead of a full serving as I was serving to two. I actually really enjoyed the hazelnut mixed in with the topping--the toasted mild flavor worked well against the sweet fruit filling.

Yum! This was fantastic. Served it to a house full of guests and got several requests for the recipe. Having lived in England, I can honestly say this is very similar to what we had there though they would not use nuts in the crumble topping. It is also traditionally served with pouring custard but is also nice with vanilla ice cream.

I didn't like this very much at all. The hazelnuts are distracting and the taste doesn't go well with the fruit. Put less sugar than the recipe calls for. I thought vanilla ice cream was also a bad idea- here it just didn't work. Everything was too sweet and the hazelnuts were just...nuts. I love hazelnuts but not here. Too bad as we tend to love strawberry and rhubarb anything!
