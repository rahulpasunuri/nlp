Very good. I also have substituted frozen blueberries for the dried fruit, orange juice for the apple juice, and yogurt for the buttermilk, because I usually have those ingredients on hand. The substitutions work beautifully

These are always a big hit. I've made them as is, but like them better with the following substitutions: 1 cup whole wheat (hard red) and 1 cup soft white wheat flour, 1 cup oat flour (made in food processor from steel cut oats). 1 cup sliced frozen cranberries (no apple), and OJ concentrate instead of apple. I've also made them with honey instead of sugar (for completely "local" recipe) and, while a little softer in texture, they are still yummy.

I would never make this again. To much liquid, to little fat and very cake like vs light. I used grated apples and needed to add more buttermilk. A waste of ingredients.

I love this recipe! I have substituted fresh orange juice for apple concentrate, and orange zest for dried apples to make cranberry orange scones. I have used milk in place of buttermilk. Also good with chocolate chips and no apples/cranberries. The possibilities are endless. The texture is great and they are no too sweet!

Regarding freezing: For my restaurant, I freeze all our scones before cooking; simply to make them fresh every day. I place the scones on a sheet and cook for about the same time and they come out perfectly. I store all varieties, well wrapped in the freezer for a week or more. Cold is good for scones...

To the cook from Vancouver: Yes, these scones freeze very well. I just thaw them at room temperature, and reheat them lightly. They are always a hit, and they are healthy!

These Scones came out GREAT! I made a few changes to make them a little sweeter and moist. I substituted Old Fashion Oats for the Oat Flour.Increased the Sugar to 1 Cup, Increased the Cinnamon to 1 Tbs, increased the Cranberries to 1 cup, used 1 diced fresh Apple with a little lime juice instead of dried apples, added 1 cup of Raisins, used 1/2 cup whole milk instead of Buttermilk, and added 1 Tbs of Vanilla. My whole family loved these!

These scones are delicious. I did not have oat flour, so I used half white whole wheat and half unbleached flour. They are not as rich as the classic scones made with whipping cream, but their flavour makes up for it. Very nice warmed up for breakfast. I will certainly make those again.

This Scone is not bad. Better warm with butter. The recipe makes 12 BIG sconces. It is a little sweet. I used fresh apples instead of dried and cherries instead of crandberries.

I made these scones this morning and followed the recipe exactly. The scones were good and all have disappeared. However, next time I might cook them for a little less time and perhaps add a touch more cinnamon or some nutmeg.
