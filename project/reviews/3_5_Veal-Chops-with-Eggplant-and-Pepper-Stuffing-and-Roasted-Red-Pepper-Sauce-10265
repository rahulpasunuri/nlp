Excellent. Sauce is really good. I made with jarred roasted peppers and was very easy. Also added a little roasted garlic to the sauce.

Don't be turned off by the 3 forks--I rarely give anything 4 forks. I thought that this recipe was excellent, and I will likely make it again. I used thick-cut bone-in pork chops instead of veal chops because they're cheaper, and I think that they taste much better. Brining the pork is a good idea, though. I used zucchini instead of eggplant because I thought that it would work better with pork. Eggplant makes sense with veal, though. I wasn't crazy about the red pepper sauce when I tasted it on it's own, but when I was eating my pork chop, I though, 'This could have used some red pepper flakes. Oh, wait! I have some red pepper sauce!' It ended up being absolutely perfect with the meat. The store only had smallish red peppers, so I got two, but it was completely unnecessary. I have no idea how two little peppers made so much sauce, but there is absolutely no way that I will come close to using all of the leftovers. So seriously--use one pepper. I might also suggest cutting back just a little bit on the oregano.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! Even my husband who doesn't even like eggplant! The red pepper sauce is fantasitic - can be used for other meal ideas.

Nice dish. But I like stuffed things. Used roasted peppers from a jar rather than fresh, both for the stuffing and for the sauce. Also used fresh herbs instead of dried(from the herb garden)
