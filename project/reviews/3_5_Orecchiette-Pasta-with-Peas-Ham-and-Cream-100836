Very good sauce but I feel the pasta to sauce ratio is off. I would do 3/4 of pasta to this sauce.

This was an easy, yet fabulous dish! I added fresh chopped parsley for an extra zip, and used white wine instead of water for an addition layer of flavor. Will definitely make this again!

I don't get all the good reviews here...it was just okay for me, and I added fresh minced garlic and a bit of crushed red pepper...still couldn't save it.

Definitely a quick and easy meal -- very pretty and very tasty. We both really liked it -- I know it is a pretty classic sauce but it would have been nice with a little more pep. I did use leeks instead of onions and prosciutto instead of ham but other than that followed the recipe. Next time I think I will add some pancetta.

This is an easy dish that is quite elegant. My only changes were to add some sliced shiitake mushrooms to the saute portion and substituted whole wheat pasta shells. The whole wheat pasta shells gave a heartier texture to the dish. I also cut back on the cream, added some chicken stock, and just simmered a bit longer to thicken it. I would definitely make this again. My husband makes a version with sauteed boneless chicken bite-sized pieces instead of the ham.

It's a hit in my house. Both sons love it and I do since easy and quick to make. I found chopped up ham in store which really cuts time too. And I have made it often!

Fantastic! Per other recs, I subbed the peas with spinach that I had on hand. Doubled the cheese and added a splash of vodka and some red pepper flakes. Delicious! Will be making it again!

This is a quick weeknight recipe! I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting bacon for ham. This dish is as keeper.

Really liked this for the ease of it and something new with peas (or asparagus) for my pasta recipe collection. Gave it 3 forks as I think it really needed some tweaking as others suggested. Added garlic with the onions, used 1/2 and 1/2 with some milk for cream and increased to 1 cup (could have still used more liquid whether it was cream/milk/pasta water), went with bacon for the ham, added crushed red peppers and some spinach cut into small pieces at the end and then threw the pasta (subbed shells which worked well) back into the pot to mix with the sauce. Would make again.

This was really good. I found it under "pasta with peas" recipes and made it despite not having any ham or prosciutto, which absolutely would have enhanced the flavors. I added the garlic per others' suggestions and used fresh English peas and a whole lot of red pepper flakes. I didn't have orecchiette so I used whole wheat shells and it was cute how the peas tucked into the shells like oysters. I will definitely make this again with some smoked or cured meat. I am sure my kids would love it.

Not bad at all! I used half and half - - just start with a little bit more and reduce it longer - - it still thickens up. I did not add salt, but used just a trace of fresh grated nutmeg. A little goes a long way. You also might consider adding just a hint of lemon zest (or grapefruit, orange or lime zest if you don't have a lemon around.)

So quick and Sooooo yummy!!! i used small rigatoni instead

What a great way to make use of leftover Easter ham - so fast, so simple, so delicious. I wish I had taken others' recommendations to increase the amount of sauce or decrease the pasta. This would also be great with asparagus in place of the peas.

Rating: 3
This is excellent. I add garlic with the onions but follow the rest of the recipe as written. The sauce is ready in the time it takes to cook the pasta. Great way to use leftover ham. But it's good enough to just buy ham for this alone.

My wife and I enjoyed this but I did make a couple of modifications to the recipe. First I used a med-large skillet so I could finish everything in the skillet. As suggested by one of the other reviews, I added garlic which I cooked along with the onion. I used table cream instead of heavy cream (I had some on hand) and finally instead of ham, I used bacon which I cooked until crisp then chopped and added at the end. I also used a technique that Lidia uses in her books and TV shows - when the cream sauce was ready, I put the orecchiette directly into the cream sauce in the skillet (it also serves to reheat the pasta if necessary). I tossed and coated the pasta, added the bacon, then served in bowls. One final note, I thought the cream sauce was getting a little thick before I added the orecchiette so I added a little of the pasta water to the sauce until it was the thickness I wanted.

Three and a half fork worthy! Easy and delicious. Added one clove of fresh garlic with the onion. Excellent way to use up leftover ham. A keeper recipe.

Rating: 3
For me, 3 forks means I'll definitely make it again! Don't think you need heavy cream, though maybe that's because I threw in about 3/4 of fresh mozerella at the end. Yummy....

This recipe is wonderful. It can be ready in the time it takes to cook the pasta. It is fast enough for a quick weeknight meal and good enough for company. The only modifications I make are to add some garlic with the onions and use fettuccine. Sometimes I've used half and half instead of heavy cream. If I use half and half I use a little more Parmesan cheese. There are never any leftovers.

i have made this one 3 times now and its always quick & delicious - even the picky little ones gobble up seconds. i have made it once with prosciutto and twice with bacon, increasing the peas and adding garlic as other users recommend, i also use dairy fresh half & half with a little extra parm and it's wonderful!

Thanks to the great tips here, I doubled the sauce, used 3/4 lb pasta, 2 cups peas, & 2 cloves garlic. NOW it's 4 forks... & a delicious way to use that Easter ham! The taste is reminiscent of carbonara.

I followed the garlic (probably added more than a clove), more peas (and pearl onions), and less pasta route and got four huge and saucy servings. I also sauteed some octopus and added it in instead of ham. This will definitely be done again.

Very good - a super-easy weeknight meal. I added a big clove of garlic, a full cup of peas and only used 8 oz of pasta. The kids loved it!

pasta with peas, prosciutto cotto and cream is an Italian classic. i was very happy with this recipe. it's very simple, very fast and very tasty. my Italian boyfriend was very happy with the results. he did, however, insist that the dish called for penne. i used a little less butter, and at the very end i added a very tiny pinch of nutmeg. delicious! i think it's also a very child friendly dish. i will be making this again as a warm and filling winter meal.

the proportions of ingredients in the sauce where just right. I reduced white wine over onions before adding next ingredient. i want to add the peas later so they stay bright. i did homemade taglielle with 2 cups flour, 2 eggs, plenty of red pepper flakes, and sprinkle of sugar.

Rating: 4
Yum! Easy and quick; I did reduce the butter, used half-and-half, and increased the peas (love those!). I also used 12 oz pasta as earlier reviewers said.

Delicious and so easy! Next time I would add a bit more peas and ham to avoid war. I used whole wheat cioccioli instead of orecchiette, which worked quite well. Yum!

This was good but very rich and I didn't think worth all the calories from the butter and heavy cream. Will try and lighten it up a bit next time.

This recipe was tasty and so easy to make. It does need more sauce for the amount of pasta. For 1 lb of pasta I will make 1 1/2 recipes of the cream sauce next time.

This was so easy and very good but it definitely needs either more sauce or less pasta. For 1 lb of pasta I would do 1 1/2 recipes of the cream sauce. I will be making this again.

This is a recipe that lends itself to fiddling, especially if you have some veggies you want to use up. I added corn, asparagus, variously colored peppers, and parsley, and almost threw in a little mint but decided I had complicated it enough. Used bacon intead of ham. Of course, I needed a little more cream and butter to make enough sauce. It was great; I'm sure it would have been delicious as written, but since becoming an "Epicurious cook" I rarely make anything exactly as written.

Yum! So easy and delicious. I selected "Yes" to make it again, but I'm not sure if I will because of the heavy cream. Maybe I'll try it with regular milk and cornstarch.?

As someone else said, what's not to like? This site saved me again... I was about to run out for take-out but dreading putting 3 kids in the car and waiting for take-out to be ready. Sad, huh? So... it was omelettes or "pasta ham peas" in the search engine at Epicurious. Don't know if the kids'll eat it, but I tasted it and if they don't, they're missing out. Looks a lot like the boxed macaroni & cheese I doctor up w/ ham & peas, so maybe they'll be fooled. Quick & easy dinner, will keep it.

Yummy. My kids gobbled it up. The only changes I made were adding a little minced garlic with the onions and I used egg noodles because that's what I had on hand. I highly recommend the garlic. I love all of the helpful info I get from reviews.

Rating: 3
Good Dish but its hard to go wrong with Butter, Heavy Cream and Pasta. I thought the noodles were a bit bland. I used proscuitto instead of the ham and about 3/4lb of pasta to the sauce. I would make this dish again but only because its a simple side dish and comes together in minutes with ingredients that are already in the fridge.

Good and easy. inspired by a dish at Buca di Beppo, we used tortellini as the pasta and added fresh diced tomatoes (seeded!) when combining the sauce and pasta. Really, really good, not divine.

Great flavor and ease but way too much pasta. Try adding 1/2 pasta to sauce then put in handfuls til right consistency.

Rating: 3
I used hot Italian chicken sausage instead of ham to perk up the flavor. Good thing I did because it was a bit bland. But with a bit of sea salt and pepper, it was very good. I also used Land O'Lakes Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2. Only other thought is that it could have used 3/4 lb of pasta and still been excellent.

Tasty way to use up New Year's Day ham. I used farfalle instead of orecchiette since that's what I had in the pantry. Fast and easy! I'll definitely make again.

Rating: 3
A really nice, easy, simple dish. I also needed to do something with a bunch of leftover Thanksgiving ham, and this was the perfect solution. It's doesn't taste too "hammy," which is nice in case you've overdosed on ham. I doubled all the sauce ingredients and substitued half and half for the heavy cream and used penne, and it was hearty and flavorful. Be sure to wait until the end to add salt - the ham makes the sauce salty, so be sure to taste before you season.

What's not to love? Cream, butter, cheese, ham-yum. I only used 10 oz. of pasta and substituted penne. Also I used a slightly more peas and cheese than called for. Could use bacon or other smoked meat in place of ham. Wonderful!

Oooh. OOOH! mmm. I had extra ham from a full ham and I mined Epicurious for ham recipes. This was one of my favorites (the other is the potato crusted quiche, so nice). I cut the cream with half and half and used a regular (yellow) onion and tossed in some black olives and a splash of vodka in the saute stage. Oh man I'm hungry again just thinking about it.

This recipe worked great! Super easy and very delicious. We made one unexpected substitution - dry-packed sundried tomatoes instead of ham. Sounds crazy to some - but the sundried tomatoes pack a lot of flavor and texure. We also added a bunch of fresh basil. It makes for a fantastic meatless version of this wonderful dish.

Super easy, kid-pleasing weekday meal. The second time I made it I added a tablespoon or so of brandy to liven it up, and more peas. That helped enhance the flavor.

This was delicious & full of flavour. I added some sun dried tomatoes, olives and mushrooms once the onion had cooked and it really added to the flavours. I also cooked the onion in the sundried tomato oil instead of butter. It was very easy and I will definatley be cooking it again.
