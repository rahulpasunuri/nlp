This is a fabulous and very easy baklava. I would suggest using more filo dough than the recipe suggests however. It's got a wonderful texture and perfect balance of flavors. Everyone has been asking me to make it again! Keeps in the fridge quite nicely as well.

Delicious! Not as hard as it seems, and everybody loved it, even the picky ones! I don't like the drizzled chocolate and nuts on top, I thought it took away from the golden brown color of the phyllo, but to each their own.

I started making this with the leftover phyllo dough whenever I make spanakopita - huge hit. Have tried with the dried cherries as suggested in the reviews, but found it a bit too sweet. LOVE it with the dates. Also took the advice of Troy from VA and used his syrup recipe - much eaiser, and very tasty. I skip the chocolate sauce and whipped cream and go for the more typical, simple, Greek presentation. Fantastic!

This is always a hit when I make it. It's NOT dry but in fact very juicy and moist even after a day or two. It's very flexible and you can add/subtract ingredients depending on your allergies/dislikes/etc. This is a keeper for sure.

I made this as is & it was fantastic! Took it to work for a Christmas port & stilton party we host at the pub every year & had to print out several copies of the recipe.

It was a big hit! Slightly dry so next time I will make a bit more syrup and put some honey and lemon in it.

I made this recipe for a Greek-themed dinner club meal and wanted to try something other than just the traditional baklava. It turned out so well! It was very easy to put together and I took the recommendation of another cook to substitute the dates for dried cherries (cut down on the sugar if the cherries are sweetened). I added for presentation a cherry red wine sauce and a sour cream/whipping cream mixture. I drizzled the sauces across triangled baklava pieces for added color and flavor and it looked great. Everyone at the dinner club loved it!

This recipe was ALMOST perfect. I skiped the water and sugar mixture for a more traditional mixture of honey (1/4 cup), light corn syrup (1/4 cup) enough water just to thin it out a bit (maybe 1/8 cup) oh and a tbsp of molasses.

I made this recipe as is and it was fabulous. The proportions are great, it's not too chocolaty or too sticky. Everyone loved it.

I used chopped dried cherries in place of the dates. Amazing! 4 stars when made with dreid cherries (you could probbably use dried cranberries fro the same effect, just less expenive and easier to find)

take the dates out and add banana or zuchini.
