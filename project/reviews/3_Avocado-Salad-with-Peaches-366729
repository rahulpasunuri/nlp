LOVED IT, one of my guests even told me it was her favorite salad ever. However To make things easier I used a can of peppers for the dressing and regular red wine vinager. I did use arugula but also bought a store mix of lettuce called italian, to add more greens to it. Also used canned peaches.

Really easy to put together. Fresh and easy to go on a summer day. Good choice

I loved the dressing. The combination of avocado and peach is amazing with this dressing. Not a big fan of arugula so I substituted spinach. It was fine.

Is this salad supposed to be served warm or cold?

I grilled the peaches as well as the avocado, awesome, but next time I think I would do a mix of arugula and sorrel instead of one or the other; plain arugula was a little bitter.

One question: it would help to know the size of the vanilla bean before it is halved. I looked at my shoelace-length beans from Costco and had to guess.

Wonderful summer salad recipe. I added a little grilled chicken, and it was the perfect compliment to the creamy avocado and sweet peach. I loved the vanilla. I also grilled the peaches along with the avocado. This will be a go to dish.

I was expecting something amazing, but was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly: the grilled avocado was great, our peaches, local and in season, were great. But everyone found it too sweet. Could be that the arugula (baby arugula in a box) lacked sharpness to offset the sweetness. I'll grill avocado again, but I'll skip this salad.

I've been a home chef and loyal Epicurious user for a LONG time. This is, without question, the best salad I've ever made. I skipped grilling the avocado but otherwise made it as-is. Don't skip using a real vanilla bean. This is what makes this recipe. It's creamy, light, and delicious. Make sure you have GREAT peaches/nectarines. This is my new salad for entertaining. Everyone raved and it was so easy.

I like the idea, but grilling the avocados made them mushy. I'll think I'll give it another try without grilling.

I took some shortcuts and it was still delicious. My shortcuts - didn't grill the avocado, used roasted bell pepper from a jar, and used a little vanilla extract instead of the bean. I'm sure grilling the avocado and using the bean would be awesome. I used mostly arugula with some sorrel mixed in--about 1/4 cup per serving--and that was delicious, but I don't think this would be good with all sorrel. At least my sorrel from the farmer's market was *very* strongly lemony. I wouldn't want a whole salad of that.
