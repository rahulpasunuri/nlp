I cheated by buying pre-made (but unbaked) frozen mini tart shells (they have them in the freezer section at Whole Foods. If you go that route, a tip: par-bake the shells in their little foil tins for much longer than prescribed by the packaging, and then fill with the mushroom filling and bake some more. As for the mushroom filling, I am a newlywed and this was my first time using my new food processor. It's apparently quite the machine, because I had mushroom puree in about 20 seconds. I followed the recipe, anyway, and believe it or not, even with mushroom puree, this was the hit of the party! A real come-from-behind winner. People went nuts. So save yourself some effort, use pre-made tartlet shells, and even if you puree your mushrooms, you'll have a winner on your hands. The puree was even delicious smeared on baguette slices and baked the next day ...

Everyone who likes mushrooms really enjoyed these. I omitted the enoki-dake mushrooms and used pre-made tartlet shells and it was still very good.
