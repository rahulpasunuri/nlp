This was good but was lacking something. Might serve with a puddle of dense chocolate fudge also on the plate next time. The toasted coconut gave it a wonderful texture. Can see adding toasted macadamia nuts next time as suggested below. I omitted the curry (maybe the lacking something) as it didn't scream dessert.

This is a great recipe! So perfect for a summer dessert. I served it with a scoop of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream on top of the pineapple drizzled with the marinade and a healthy sprinkle of the toasted coconut. (I also added chopped toasted macadamia nuts since I had some on hand) SO GOOD! I will definitely make this again.

These are fabulous! I am not generally a fan of cooked fruit, pineapple being the top exception. I served this not as a dessert, but as a side with BBQ pork ribs. (Orange-Maple Pork Ribs, on this site, also 4 forks) I cut the fresh pineapple in thick wedges rather than rings. Must admit I skipped the curry. The rum flavor with the pineapple is terrific. These were a huge hit and I will serve them with glazed salmon and with marinated chicken in the future.

This was fantastic! Easy and a real nice "heat" from the curry. A definite keeper.

This got rave reviews at a New Year's Eve Party. We were all tired of cookies, etc. This was quick to make and tasted great. I did not serve with ice cream, just served a few slices of pineapple with the sauce and coconut. A definite keeper. Once could probably broil it if the grill was not fired up.

Wonderful summer dessert. I used a fresh pineapple but could have easily used canned rings. Served it with vanilla ice cream as suggested, but thought of using coffee. My guests really loved it.
