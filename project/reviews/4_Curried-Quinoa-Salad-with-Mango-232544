I turned this into a different recipe that I think worked well. I used 2 cups of white quinoa, diced pineapple, diced strawberries, diced orange pepper, chives and spinach. I made the dressing similar to the recipe but added an extra tablespoon of mango chutney, subbed olive oil and balsamic for canola and white vinegar and added a couple teaspoons of spicy red pepper relish. Finished with goat cheese on top. It's sweet and tangy and I think the goat cheese adds a lot. Would probably also be be good with toasted pine nuts or walnuts, but I didn't add that.

LOVE this salad! This is one of our all time favorites. I always serve it with Tandori Chicken and Naan, so good!

Nice recipe, and a good base from which to get creative. My latest rendition included a pear chutney instead of mango and some strawberries. I make this recipe when I'm going to do a long-haul air travel. I make it the day before, freeze it, then keep it in my carry on (TSA has been fine with it). By the time it's dinner, it's thawed enough to just be chilled and ready to eat.

Honestly, one of the easiet, most delicious and nutricious dishes you can make (I'm doing it as I keep one eye on the 2012 Olympic action---Go, Canada, GO!) My "add-ons"---I used Stonewall Kitchen's Fig and Ginger Jam as my "chutney" (and a little more than 1 tbl). Also added a little bit more curry, but kept mustard the same. I wanted to round it all off and soften the taste a little, without losing the "zing'. Also, since it's summer I felt I could go a tad mellower. So I added about 1/8 tsp. Madagascar vanilla. Delish! Let dressing sit all day and added to chilled quinoa about an hour before serving, then back to fridge to let all of it mix and mingle. Also, not a fan of cucumber as it goes gushy too soon, imo. So out it came.

Followed many other who increased the spices, also added cranberries and small amount of goat cheese to the finished product. Loved it on salad and pita chips.

This salad is such a keeper, i really don't get how anyone can call this bland (how can anything with curry in it be bland?). Always use fresh mangoes or even very ripe peaches! Definitely one of those better-the next-day salads when the dressing really soaks into the quinoa.

This really didn't do it for me, surprisingly (since curry and mango, yum!). I did not double the dressing, and it seems like maybe I should have, as I just didn't think there was enough flavor. Also, even though it is a little more work, I think I prefer the quinoa "boil then steam" method in the Black Bean and Tomato Quinoa recipe instead; the grain came out much lighter and fluffier than this one did. So, I'm glad this recipe worked well for so many, it just wasn't for me. I wished I'd eaten that perfect mango on it's own.

I omitted the cucumber and instead used jicima and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. It really made it delicious and added to the "crunch" value, in that is was not soggy the next day. YUM!

Love this recipe but I double the chutney and add a bit of extra salt.

Made this recipe the first time exactly per instructions, and it was a little bland. Per other reviewers, doubled the vinegar, hot chutney, curry powder, and dried mustard - substituted a very good balsamic vinegar for the white - this time there were no leftovers, and had many requests for the recipe.

Ok this is totally cheating, but I made it with some fresh mango and pineapple salsa from the deli section of the store, and it came out great! The combination of quinoa (I used the black kind), mango, green onions, and a little spice is perfect for summer.

Loved this recipe! For a first go, I followed everyone's advice and doubled the curry & then doubled the dressing. Fantastic with dinner & fantastic in wraps the next day. Next time i'll try adding cashews and red pepper.

Delicious! Just the right amount of curry and dressing.

I never follow recipes to the letter, especially not with regard to quantities, so I can't comment on whether the dressing has too much of this or that, or if there is too much or too little of it...I will say that the combination of ingredients and flavors in this salad is terrific and it comes together quickly and incredibly easily. I chilled the quinoa on a sheet pan in the freezer for fifteen minutes as I didn't have time to make it very far in advance. This salad is lovely - and pretty to look at, too.

I tried this recipe along side a few other quinoa salads. I had never cooked with quinoa before, so I decided to diversify. I felt like the curry was light. In the future I would add hot curry. The flavor had sweet-mango, fresh-cucumber, but no spice. That would have balanced better. I added quinoa until I liked the veggie:quinoa balance.

Great salad recipe! I was a little skeptical as I was making it, but it really came together in the ends. Needs quite a bit of salt to bring out the spice and sweetness. Also added a can of drained chickpeas and it totally made it even better!

Fantastic! Didn't have spinach. Used a mixture of frozen mangos and peaches. Used celery in place of cucumber. Will be shopping for all ingredients to make again as written.

Kick ass recipe! I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I simply couldn't find (or afford) all of the ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly except: 1) used olive oil instead of canola oil, 2) left out the dry mustard, 3) subsituted cantelope for mango (mangos are $6 in Moscow, but cantelope is $3).

Delicious. Great healthy side dish and keeps well for lunch the next day. I like using red quinoa and rinsing it well before cooking.

Rating: 3
OK, so most of the reviews I have read are right on. Not enough curry flavor, but WAY too much quinoa for 2 servings. I did not have quite 1 full cup, so used about 7/8 cup of quinoa, and there was enough for 4 or more servings, but could have used more spinach. There could be more dressing too. Would make it again but adjust the proportions.

Rating: 4
I really like this dish. I have used it for picnics and brunches. It is really refreshing. I do agree that it could benefit from more curry and I double the vinaigrette. I typically have mixed the one vinaigrette quantity into the salad and then pass the extra vinaigrette separately. I place the mango spears in a spoke pattern on top of the mounded quinoa on a platter and it is beautiful. This recipe yields way more than 2 servings (probalby at least 4 servings).

I followed the recipe and wasn't that impressed with the results. The dressing is too heavy on the vinegar and way too light on the curry flavor. If I make it again I'll probably double or triple the curry.

Love this, though like everyone has mentionned, there really isn't enough dressing! I used red quinoa so there's a nice color contrast. I also added more green onion, sirracha sauce and chopped up coriander leaves. It could do with some mashed garlic as well.

This salad was absolutely delicious! In the future, I would make a bit more vinaigrette for the salad itself and for the spinach, which was a bit dry. It was even better the next day!

This was delicious. Like some other reviewers, I combined everything in one big bowl. I halved the amount of oil and doubled the other dressing ingredients as the flavors were not as strong as I like initially. Great the second day, too! I'll definitely make this again.

I don't bother with the spinach or the spears for garnish. I double the recipe and it makes a great lunch box item. Also, as a side dish to seafood or bbq'd meats.

I made this recipe for a group of 12. I multiplied the ingredients by 3 and it made a huge amount, there were leftovers with people going for seconds. The dressing is not enough as stated I needed to make it 2x's (ingredients x's 6 instead of 3 like the salad ingredients) Many asked for the recipe, delicious and healthy.

I used pre-peeled & sliced mango from Trader Joe's. also used their mango ginger chutney. made the quinoa in a rice cooker adding 1.5c water to the 1c quinoa. I didn't plate it out like the recipe suggests. Instead I mixed everything together in a large tupperware bowl to be eaten over a few days, substituting wilted arugula for spinach. I also added a handful of alfalfa sprouts which didn't really add or take anything away from the overall taste (they were in the fridge and I needed to use them). A solid side dish.

I made this salad, and everyone loved it. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and added a cube of chipotle bullion. It adds flavor to the quinoa. I would probably add a little more curry powder, as I love the flavor of curry.

My new favorite salad for summer! I added chopped colored peppers, more green onion, 1 T. more chutney, and didn't use spinach, but I will next time. Delicious & refreshing.

This was a huge hit tonight! I skipped the spinach to serve it to a large crowd on a buffet. I doubled the mango chutney in the dressing, and it was perfect!

I can't give this a proper rating because I mistakenly substituted mango-pineapple preserve for the mango chutney. My result was way too sweet and I didn't enjoy it, but may try to make it again with the chutney.

this recipe is wonderful, and versatile. i have used israeli couscous instead of the quinoa, eliminated the spinach, added red pepper. you can really experiment. i make the dressing 2-3 days in advance for an easy do-ahead recipe. i've used it for large groups because it can be served at room temperature.

I have a catering company and use this salad for business lunches - everyone always wants the recipe - I add a bit more mango chutney then what's called for.

As suggested, I added cashews, diced red pepper and more green onion than called for. I roughly chopped the spinach and tossed it with the quinoa. I will add cayenne or diced jalapenos next time. I didn't really taste the fresh mango -- I wonder if jarred mango, which I've never tried, would taste sweeter? The recipe must make far more than 2 servings. I made 4X the recipe and it could have easily served 15 or more people.

A variation of this is one of our staple salads at our Deli. I add dried cranberries and cubed dried apricots and more scallions. It's colorful, delicious and sells out every time! Be sure to wash the Quinoa (rub vigorously between hands in water) Before cooking, otherwise it will be bitter!

I have made this dish last week and it was simple and delicious. Quinoa has been a part of our diet ever since Epicurious made me discover it. Could the cook from Peru explain how she toasts quinoa? Thanks!

Quinoa is native of my country, so tasting this wonderful combination has been great.I toasted the Quinoa ligtly before cooking as we do, gives a much better aroma.

Great with grilled meat or fish. If you make your own curry powder or use a top-quality store-bought one, I don't think you need the mustard.

Rating: 3
Be sure to wash the quinoa thoroughly before cooking as it has a bitter coating called saponins! I would add a bit of sweet to this salad, I added a scant Tablespoon of orange juice concentrate to help meld the flavors along with the chutney, which to me, seemed insufficient. Otherwise great, used some arugula as part of the spinach amount and that sharper taste was nice.
