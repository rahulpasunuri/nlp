I love love this soup! I've made it for several years & it always impresses me. Just made it again this week with sourdough bread & fresh romas & basil. I don't process mine too much - love it a little chunky.

My husband and I loved this soup! So easy and tasty. Using basil is key because that's the main flavor of the soup. I used canned tomatoes, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

Tasty, as made, but probably would have found it a bit bland had I not added a bit more spice. Didn't have basil, but added a bit of fresh thyme and oregano, as well as some finishing honey, hungarian paprika and hot sauce as well as a bit of cream. I used a mixture of whole canned tomatoes, a few large fresh (though a bit overripe) and some tomato paste. I also blended mine a bit, though if I had chopped a bit more carefully, I wouldn't have needed to. Good base recipe.

This soup is delicious and the recipe allows room for innovation as you can see from the variations offered by reviewers. I used roasted canned tomatos which gave it a nice flavor. People should not fuss about the chunky nature of the soup. It is a style of soup typical of Italy and Spain and offers a use for old bread that you might anyway throw away. I blended my soup so the kids would eat it. That approach seemed to mix in the olive oil effectively and the soup was tasty not oily. A real keeper.

This soup is delish. We used half fresh garden toms (roasted with the garlic) and half canned. We used the bread like croutons instead of mixing them in. The combo of garden toms and using bread as croutons made for a tangy-er soup, but delightful. I will make it again using garden toms and experimenting with a tablespoon or two of cream to cut the tang. Really good stuff.

This soup was quick, hearty and great for a cold night. Perfect for a quick healthy dinner, probably not a show stopper main dish to serve at a dinner party (at least without some recipe variations). I used really good quality herb slab bread from the local baker, canned tomatoes, a little hot sauce and tons of fresh basil. At the end I served the soup in a big bowl with fresh cut up basil and fresh parm cheese sprinkled on top. As others have noted, quality of ingredients are key. Next time I'll try roasting fresh tomatoes and garlic beforehand.

this sounds delicious and it is.

I must admit I didn't follow the recipe; instead, I used it as a base to make my own soup. I used 3 slices whole-wheat bread and pureed most of the soup 3/4 of the way through in a food processor. I also added pine nuts and about twice as much basil as was recommended. It will be great to freeze for the winter, and it will be lovely served with some yogurt and a few fresh basil leaves. Quite hearty.

This soup is extremely bland; there's hardly any tomato taste to it. Two thumbs down.

Great recipe. Used 1/2 the chicken stock (canned). Omitted the salt & salted to preference at table. For the bread, sliced sourdough, brushed with olive oil, baked, then rubbed with garlic. Dipped bread into soup when eating.

Onions are called for in the ingredients, but never called for in the preparation! I would not make a recipe submitted so carelessly!!!

I'm not much of a cook - but this soup was simple to make and very tasty. I used the Garlic Broth recipe instead of chicken stock, and I added a cup of small, round cooked pasta to thicken it up. All the flavors soaked up and we ate this for days. So good!

Delicious! I used fresh heirloom tomatoes and roasted them along with the garlic before making the soup. I used twice the amount of garlic. My husband loved it. It tasted even better the second day. Yum!

This was yummy, and so easy to make. i used canned plum tomatoes and just cut 'em up. my 3-day-old bread could have been more stale in the middle--the bread for this recipe should be very dry, based on similar recipes i've made. i always have a big stash of basil in the freezer, which works well in recipes like this.

This is a pretty authentic version of the Italian classic soup. I halved and oven-roasted the tomatoes beforehand to add a little extra flavor. I also suggest breaking up the bread into smaller chunks to make it easier to break down, and using a wire whisk to break up the chunks once it's in the soup. Also added a bit of sugar to balance out the acidic garlic/onion/tomato combination.

Roasting the tomatoes, soaking the bread, roasting the garlic. This recipe is great when tomatoes are in season.

I found the soup a little bland, as another reviewer mentioned. I found that adding some white pepper perked it up. I also discovered that this very basic soup has some wonderful versatility. I added Italian herbs one day,another day I replaced the basil with cilantro, cayenne and cumin and served it with cheese on top for a Mexican pitch-in, I've added cubed cooked chicken and pork with pleasant results. It's a great simple starter recipe that can be easily tweaked to suit your mood!

This was really good! I really liked it. I would probably not fool around with the garlic broth again. I'd use good solid veggie broth. However, garlic broth aside - this had a really great flavor. I ended up adding almost 6 cups of broth to get it to the consistency that I liked it. I also used canned crushed tomatoes because the fresh ones aren't in yet.

I tried to adapt this for a vegetarian by using the garlic broth.My guests were kind. It was just plain bland - and I did use heads of garlic. It's probably got more umph with chicken broth.

I didn't like this soup but it may be because I knew bread was the thickener and it kind of was a gross concept (was thinking about the reviewer that said it was "gluey"). I had to put in blender to make smooth - was to thick so added more chicken stock. My husband loved the soup so will probably make again for him.

This is great soup! I used celebrity tomatoes out of my garden instead of roma. You must sautee the onions before you add the garlic (as others have noticed it's not in the recipe). Very easy.

always a winner; esp. when made with homemade chicken stock. the key is to use decent bread...

I used the linked garlic broth with a small modification. I strained the garlic, moved it to a food processor, pureed, then put back in the stock. I also added two boulion cubes to the stock. Added a very subtle yet powerful garlic flavor to the whole dish.

The cook from Seattle says the onions left an unpleasant taste. This is because the instructions shoud have told us to SAUTE the onions just before adding the garlic. An earlier reviewer mentioned this.

There are better, more traditional versions of this Italian peasant soup. The onions in this one left an unpleasant after taste, I'd advise leaving them out and adding good grated Italian hard chesse to each serving right before eating.

The flavor of this recipe is wonderful. I am not sure if I used too much bread or not, but it was a little gummy. I will make it again and leave out the bread and use some garlic crutons instead.

This soup was delicious! I used sourdough and a mixture of fresh and canned plum tomatoes. I also cooked the soup for a bit longer than suggested (around 30 minutes) to make it a little thicker, and used a fresh mozerella at the end.

This is a very hearty soup...delicious. We used sourdough bread instead and this brought a tanginess to the soup that everyone liked.

This soup is really delicious! We used Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, and added only 1 teaspoon of Sea Salt. Came out light, but the olive oil is what gives it body and sticking power. Will definately make again!

A perfect match for a windy and dark November night! Tomato season is long gone, so I used a 28-oz can of whole peeled tomatoes (w/juice) and added a small can of tomato paste when I added veggie stock and the bread (homemade rye that had left its bottom crust on the baking tray). The texture of the soup was unusual, but it turned out great w/a sprinkle of cheese and was VERY filling. Two thumbs up from my husband too :-)

This soup was a hit on my dinner table. I had a little bit of trouble breaking the bread down, butI put it all in a blender and it came out perfect. The taste is wonderful.

My daughter chose this soup recipe from my file. It was easy to make and we both loved it. However, we like most of what we eat with a bit more bite, so I used more pepper. The ease of preparation and the great taste and texture of this soup definitely make for a repeat experience.

Great recipe, took a long time to make though. I used less than the 1/3 cup olive oil, next time I'll use even less, no need for all of it.

The directions don't indicate when to add the onions, so be sure to add them in with the garlic and basil. Overall, a tasty soup.

This is a great easy recipe. Hearty and perfect for a cold winter day. I made a few changes and it was wonderful. I used 1 green bell pepper,4 cloves of garlic,1 28oz can of diced tomatoes drained and used 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried basil leaves.(didn't have time to go to the grocery)

Delicious! I used hot dog buns (hee hee) since I have bundles left over from last weekend's bbq. I drizzled roasted garlic oil over the top to add some more garlicky flavor and I topped it with parm. The most gourmet usage of hot dog buns I've ever seen.

Excellent rich soup. I added red bell peper in with the onions since the out-of-season tomatoes were not a rich red color. I'm anxious to make this using vine-ripe tomatoes!

A very delicious recipe, hearty enough for a main course. I'd try a few shavings of cheese (pecorino)a garnish and for flavor the next time.

Very good receipe, but I added more garlic (being Italian). Try adding the bread before adding the liquids so that the bread will absorb the flavor of the onions and garlic. A light chianti goes well with this soup.
