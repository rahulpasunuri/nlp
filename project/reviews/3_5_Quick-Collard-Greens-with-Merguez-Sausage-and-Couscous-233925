An excellent way to use some Merguez (lamb)I discovered at the local butcher shop and the collard plus other greens in my CSA box. It even got my son to eat greens!!! He appreciated the subtle flavors of the cumin and cinnamon. The only substitution I made was dried cherries for the currants. This one definitely goes into the recipe box when I need to switch up greens!

I hesitate to review a recipe when I've made substitutions, but given the difficulty I had finding merguez, I didn't have much choice. I used bulk chicken hot Italian sausage and browned it with the onions but followed the rest of the recipe as directed. I served the sausage, collard, currant mixture atop Israeli couscous, and it was delicious. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch.

I beg to differ, this recipe is all about the collard greens. With the sausages it is great; however, I can see making the greens w/o the sausages as a side dish on a regular basis. The flavors are excellent.

We've had this twice for dinner and it's pretty tasty! .. the focus is the sausage and couscous, not the collards. It worked well substituting diced eggplant, garbanzo beans and a chopped tomato for the greens. If you use the greens, a half cup of cooking water instead of a whole cup is plenty cook the vegetables. And finally, we liked adding sliced almonds or toasted pine nuts. A keeper!

not sure why collard greens get top billing here- the way i'm familiar with it is very merguez and couscous focused! bottom line, if you don't have collard greens or other sturdy greens, but you do DO have some nice merguez and cous cous, this is an absolutely fine recipe. put some greens on the side if you're feeling bad about the only green on your plate being flecks of cilantro!

Very tasty, quick, one-dish meal. Great way to use the collards we get in our CSA box. For those of us who like (but don't love) collards, this recipe offers lots of contrasting flavors and textures.

This is just wonderful but depends on the quality of the sausage. The one I used was all lamb and it was exceptional. I'm going back to look for more. Made it exactly as indicated.

I was looking for a swiss chard recipe and decided to use this one. No Merguez sausage, so I used a standard hot pork sausage from the chain supermarket and added thai chilis. Swiss chard needs no blanching, so after I cooked the sausage, I added the onions. I chopped up the swiss chard stalks and threw those in a few minutes after the onions. Once browned, I added a little chicken broth with cumin,a cinnamon stick, and bay leaves to simmer. After 10 minutes or so, I added the swiss chard cut into 1" strips, turned down the heat and let simmer/steam until desired tenderness. I served this over Israeli cous cous which is larger than the regular kind. I topped with toasted slivered almonds (no currants.)

My husband and I loved this! I didn't have any merguez sausage so I made some. http://charcuterista.wordpress.com/2008/02/24/merguez-sausage/ I didn't bother putting them in the casings, just flavored the ground lamb and cooked!

Delicious! The only drawback was too-hot merguez. Suggest testing a piece of sausage (cooked) first if you aren't familiar with the brand. Will double greens next time.

I found this dish to be quick, easy, and delicious. Instead of Merguez sausage, I used a red pepper and onion chicken sausage. I'm sure the change in sausage altered the intended flavor, but my end product was delicious. The spice of the sausage and red pepper balanced well with the sweet of the currants and earthiness of the collard greens. I will definitely make this dish again.

Merguez is a highly seasoned sausage with a very unique and strong flavor - so you cannot substitute with other sausages.

Verrrry interesting. No 'merguez' available in my hood, so I used veal sausage. I loved all the ingredients individually, but somehow the combo didn't thrill me in the end. However, the recipe was easy, healthy & made for a good dinner. I served it over Kashi Pilaf.

This is a quick, delicious and very satisfying meal. I was able to find the merguez at my local cheese shop in Brooklyn. I will definately make this again!
