I had this type of salad all over Paris - it's Lyonnaise, i believe, and it's usually made with poached eggs and really thick-cut bacon. I prepared it with frisee and poached eggs, fried the potatoes in small dice in the bacon fat - it was perfect, my boyfriend raved about it. Also made a toasted crouton with a disk of goat cheese on top, put under the broiler for a minute, and served that on top of the salad - excellent!

This is a very tasty and filling salad. Quite a departure from the usual rabbit food salads consist of.

How I would change this recipe: (1)boil the eggs, don't fry them; (2)bake or broil the potatoes. Otherwise, it's a great salad! I love bacon...

Excellent. My changes: used frisee and poached, rather than fried, the eggs. It was less fat, but just as delicious. This is a old favorite from my days in bistros in France.
