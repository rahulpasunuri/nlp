One error below - 1/2 cup milk + 1 1/2 cup yogurt.

Yum! I love the blueberry bran muffins at Whole Foods so was looking for a similar recipe. This is pretty close. I substituted frozen blueberries for the figs (added at the end), 1/2 cup milk mixed with 2 1/2 cup full fat yogurt as I didn't have buttermilk, and used salted butter instead of unsalted because that was all I had, and they were delicious. I used the recipe once before only substituting the blueberries, and it was good but not quite as good as with these 3 substutitions. (They were denser last time)

recipe went well. I used untoasted wheat bran (there is an unprocessed cereal that works). I'd add a few more dates next time.

These turned out perfectly light, fluffy and moist. I used 1 1/4 cups spelt flour and 1 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I used 1 cup of oat bran and 1 cup of wheat bran and added a 1/2 cup of ground flax seed. I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter. Instead of white sugar I used dark brown sugar. I added 1 tsp of apple pie spice and 1 tsp of pure vanilla. Used raisins instead of figs (hubby doesn't like figs). I think next time I will give maple syrup or agave nectar a try in place of honey and perhaps some citrus rind.

This recipe was easy to make and produced a moist and flavorful muffin that seems relatively healthy. The honey flavor comes through strongly (I used a dark artisanal honey, which I would recommend). Much more moist than many other bran muffins I've gnawed on in the past.

It's hard to find a recipe where I can omit the sugar and use alternate flours without turning the muffins into rocks. This recipe worked with no problems; used spelt flour and omitted the sugar and the texture still turned out fluffy. A great recipe for those avoiding white sugar.

I tried to healthify these: -1c whole wheat flour for part of the white flour -only used 1/2c white sugar -1c natural applesauce + 2T canola oil (for the butter) -2T white vinegar + enough skim milk to toal 2c for the buttermilk -used rasins and dried cranberries for the figs (just didn't have the figs) -drizzled a tiny bit of honey over each muffin prior to baking Results: They taste like good, healthy, bran muffins. I'll add more dried fruit next time and also try spraying the tins and not using the paper liners (lots of muffin lost stuck to the liner when cooked, boo!)

I made a few substitutions... I used a multi fibre bran cereal (untoasted), 2 cups whole wheat flour + 1/4 c ground flax seeds (for the all purpose flour), Olivinia margarine (instead of butter), 1/2 brown sugar (instead of white), skim milk (instead of buttermilk). The muffins were light and oh so tasty! Definitely best bran muffin I've ever had!

I love these muffins! The only change I made is that I nearly doubled the figs (I'm a huge fan of figs).

I also forgot to soak the bran. I did toast it in the oven as I do with raw nuts and they turned out splendid. I used a mix of chopped apricots with the figs. I poured a smidgen of honey with a little of the leftover fig water (which didn't get absorbed by the missing bran) over the tops when they came out of the over. I wanted them to be moist for tomorrow morning for Mother's Day brunch. I want to try adding some wheat germ next time. I wonder how long these will keep. Gee, I made so many I will most likely find out.

Not a real muffin girl here, and if I was it would not be a bran muffin. That being said I had a request to make muffins for a group of folks, and bran was one of the requests. It has been a week and I am still getting feedback. This was a huge hit, and the men-folk, for whatever reason, really seemed to love the taste and texture. I followed the recipe to the letter and would not change a thing. I have a feeling I am going to have some future requests so this one is going right into the recipe box!!

I added 2/3 cup flaxseed to the flour mixture, which added a lovely texture, and I also sprinkled the top of the muffins with flaxseeds before baking. Delicious, moist, and not too dense. Definitely will make again.

Haven't tried recipe yet, going to, but to answer previous reviewers question about toasting bran; put the bran in a dry, large heavyweight skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring with a whisk, until the bran is well toasted and dark, but not scorched, about 10 minutes.

Delicious! I had to make a few changes because of what I had available. I used whole wheat flour instead of wheat bran (I didn't mix it in with the water/fig mixture. I mixed it in with the all-purpose flour). The muffins turned out light and fluffy.

Muffins turned out great!! I had no idea how to toast bran, so I just stuck it in the oven on broil for 5 minutes. Does anyone have any official instructions for this??

Easy to make for a novice like me and great for on the run in the mornings

Great, but definitely not for the health-food crowd. I add extra figs and raisins, to add a bit more taste. I also like adding a tsp (or so) of cinnamon - the texture is great "as is" - but the flavor benefits from a little extra dimension.

This is a great basic recipe for bran muffins-- the muffins, light, fluffy and delicious. It is also very versatile. Any dried fruit can be substituted for the figs, and adding nuts works nicely. I always keep a stock of these muffins in the freezer, and defrost in the microwave for breakfast.

I came to this site looking for a good, easy bran muffin recipe, and this is it! I did make one fun substitution; I used huckleberries in place of the figs, and they were delicious. If you are cooking with frozen huckleberries (or most any other frozen berry), thaw them in warm water and drain them well before adding them to the batter as your final ingredient. Thawing prevents the berries from going soggy as they cook. Enjoy!

We halved this recipe to start thinking there would be too many (there are only 2 of us.) Wrong! These muffins were wonderful tasting and had a fabulous texture from the figs.

I often do not care for the texture of bran muffins if they are too oily or if the bran is too splintery. But these were quite soft and cakey. Definately use figs if you can...they add wonderful texture and flavor.

Rich and delicious. I wonder if the batter would keep in the fridge??? Figs or no figs, oat or wheat bran, no difference.

Great bran muffin even with the modifications I made: leaving out the egg yolk and using soft tub margarine instead of butter. And I used dates instead of figs since that is what I had.
