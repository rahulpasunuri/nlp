I was looking for a sauce to pretty up the flan I am serving for a party. I made a modified version of this that turned out great. I used fresh figs (about 40), and frozen blackberry juice concentrate (about 2/3 cup) as it was all I had. I added in about a 1/2 cup of fig jam, and thickened it up with corn starch. I used only about 4 tbsp of sugar. I cooked the cranberries for about 10 minutes, then added the figs and cooked on medium-low heat for about 20 more minutes. I slightly mashed the fruit once it softened. Really nice and not too sweet, which I hope will nicely compliment the flan recipe (also from epicurious).

good, but the cranberries lose a little of their tartness against the sweet ingredients. Next time, I will cut down on both the figs and the sugar (maybe 2/3 of each), and adjust for a less sweet compote.

Excellent!!! However, I make mine in a 1-1/2 quart slow cooker.

I like compotes, but I don't think my husband would like it. This recipe would be good warm or at room temperature.
