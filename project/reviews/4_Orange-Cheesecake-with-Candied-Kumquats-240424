Great texture and looks just like the photo of the recipe. Only reason why this did not get a fourth fork is cos it is a little too sweet. Will cut down on the sugar next time I make it.

This is by far the BEST cheesecake that I have ever eaten. It is a gorgeous, light dessert and not too sweet. My only recommendation would be to buy 5-10 extra kumquats.

I have made this twice to wonderful reviews. Two things: if you don't have kumquats you can make a nice little sauce with oranges, tangerines, or lemons AND if you are like me, someone who waits to long to get started, you can serve it several hours after it is made without waiting for the cooling period. It worked for me, but it was very creamy (which people seemed to love).

Excellent. It looks and tastes delicious. The leftover syrup is so worth it and can be used for many different things.

Excellent. I did strain the orange peels from the OJ before mixing it with the cream cheese mixture - only because a like a smooth filling. It still had the OJ flavor. Perfect.

Made it for last year's Thanksgiving and everybody went nuts about the cake! They loooooved it! I don't like cheesecakes, and I don't it it, but will definitely do it again this year.

This is an excellent and well- written recipe. Follow it exactly and you will have the beautiful results I had. Don't skimp on the kumquats. Next time I will use more kumquats for an even more awesome presentation and to make more syrup. Try the syrup in Earl Grey tea it's really good.

Decided on making this recipe only because I wanted a reason to buy some of the beautiful kumquats in the market. As I was making it, I was thinking this recipe was definitely going to get a poor rating from me, since preparing the kumquats was tedious, to say the least- I was thinking that throwing some softened marmalade or something would be comparable, and much less work. However- once completed and chilled, it was so worth it. I think it was the tastiest cheesecake I have ever had- perfect texture (not too airy, not too dense), delicate flavors and beautiful presentation. Try it.

Impressive looking with an even more impressive taste. The syrup from the candied kumquat is so versatile. I have used it on crepes, pancakes, ice cream, panna cota and virtually anything that needed a sweet citrusy flavor. I have resolved to make this cheesecake every time I see kumquat in my local grocery.

This cheesecake is divine... To the user who commented on the two cups of sugar part, keep in mind that the vast majority of that sugar becomes a syrup which is used at the diner's dicretion. the cake had a subtle, delicious caramelly-orange flavor that was well-worth the effort of preparation. (slicing and seeding kumquats is definitly a bit of preparation!) Will absolutely make this again.

...Or how a simple mortal can impress her guests! I celebrate Thanksgiving each year on the Friday after, all they way down in the Southern Hemispehre where although it is Spring, my kumquat trees keep producing fruit. I was delighted to have this recipe calling fir an ingredient that is actually ¨in season¨. After only dropping the additional ornge peel in the cream cheese mix ( a very appropriate move since this leaves the kumquats to STAR ALONE atop the cake) , I was able to serve a much appreciated dessert of the utmost sophistication.

2 cups of sugar??? Too sticky sweet for me!
