This is one of my favourite quick week night soups but I add one essential ingredient - a tablespoon of cooking lavender.

Not a bad starter recipe but if you want taste, be prepared to improvise. The second time I used beef stock and used a blender to make it more creamy. Must have garlicky croutons too.

This recipe was very average...I definitely have better lentil soup recipes. It was much better the next day...after the flavors had deepened.

Quite tasty, and easy too.

The recipe was excellent. I used ham hocks in place of the diced ham and it was perfect. One of the better tasting quick soups.

Some of the lentils did not become tender even though I cooked the soup for longer than 20 minutes. I thought the dish was salty even though I used the low sodium chicken broth. My boyfriend loved it and had seconds though!
