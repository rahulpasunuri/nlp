I was making a Thai feast for my mom who is a vegetarian, so I substituted mushrooms for the shrimp, and Bragg's Liquid Aminos for the fish sauce. It lacked a bit of salt, the fish sauce is probably saltier. Other than that it was lovely! I would make it this way again, but if my mom isn't eating with us, I would add a little anchovy and salt to the ketchup mixture.

Two forks means "good" and that's what this is. Quick and dirty, and tasty. If you wanted to bring it more in line with an "authentic" pad thai, you could swap out the ketchup for tamarind paste. I might try it that way next time.

Eight of us made this last night for our monthly cooking club. I was skeptical about the ketchup, but I asked a friend who has worked in a handful of Asian restaurants and she said that ketchup is not all that uncommon. It was delicious!!! I highly recommend.

I thought this was a good basic lay-out for Paad Thai. I used an asian chili-garlic sauce instead of ketchup and thought it gave a nice burn to the dish. Even though it isn't "authentic" it's much less greasy than many restaurant Paad Thai.

This dish is pretty easy to prepare and tastes very good. Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe from those who try it. A good weeknight dish to prepare.

This was really good! I had to adjust it down for 2 and replace the shallots with onion, but the flavor was still good. The only thing I would recommend changing is cutting down the amount of water at the end, maybe to 1/2 cup, and tracking down some kaffir lime leaves for garnish instead of lime wedges.

My husband loved this, but I thought it was just so-so. I felt it needed more sauce. The presentation was pretty - I put my red wok right in the middle of the table and gave each person a plate with various garnishes. I will hang on to this recipe until I've tried a couple more Paad Thai's for comparison.

I was very happy with this recipe. The outcome was delicious. Since I've never been to Thailand, I'm not all hung up on how authentic (or not) the recipe is. It was very satisfying, and I liked that it was not as greasy as restaurant pad thai. All my other attempts at this dish had turned out so-so, but with this recipe, I was a success! Yea!

Has the world gone mad? Pa-leeze - find the tamarind sauce that should be used NOT KETCHUP... I just thought I should share my thoughts since I find this to be, well... A BIG WASTE OF TIME. Be careful with fish sauce - it CAN be overpowering and the nice thing about Thai food is its complex yet SUBTLE tastes.

One of the most authentic tasting paad thai noodle recipes that I have found. My wife's favorite dish and I've been searching for a long time to find something this good. Try it!

This is modified too much from an authentic Pad Thai recipe. Pad Thai is supposed to be a simple fried rice noodle dish, sauteed with eggs, green onions, chicken/shrimp in fish sause and cilli/garlic, lime juice and sugar, served with fresh bean sprouts and peanuts. Stick to the original!

I agree. The ketchup has to go. Curiously, this recipe is on the Food TV website ("courtesy of Gourmet Magazine") sans ketchup! This is not truly authentic, but it is tasty and less greasy than most authentic versions. I took the kitchen sink approach -- sauteed sliced eggplant in peanut oil, threw in leftover chicken breast (and the shrimp) and used Trader Joe's Thai Peanut Sauce at the end to give it a little more complexity. The result was really good. American ingenuity is all about borrowing from other cultures, retooling, and then making it better than the original. Let your imagination (and leftovers in your refrigerator) put some creativity in your meals! Enjoy!

Although I haven't tried this recipe, when I read the ingrediants I was turned off. I'm Thai and I've never heard of adding Ketchup to pad thai. I understand this recipe is for the American palate..so I'm willing to be open minded. As for all the other Epicurious recipes I've tried...I give 4 forks. Except for the jerk chicken...not so good. Thank you for this great site! It's the best recipe site ever!

A great dish and very easy to make. Next time I would try to make it with chicken. Go easy on the fish sauce. The quarter tea spoon cayenne according to recipe gives you a mild spice. Make sure you follow the recipe, soaking the noodles is essential. The cooking instructions on the noodle package is for soup. Even better the next day in the micro-wave! bon appetit!

We finished this off by topping it w/chopped cilantro (instead of sprigs), squeezing a half key lime & adding about 1/2 tablespoon thinly sliced kaffir lime leaves per serving. Yummy!!! nice filling but light dinner w/excellent flavor!

We've made this dish four times using either chicken or shrimp. The noodles are best soaked as long as possible (hours). And despite the fact that my husband has lived in Indonesia, travelled extensivley in Thailand, and we have been to numerous Thai restaraunts across the country, this dish tastes like no other Paad Thai we have ever tasted. It's not bad, it's just different. I use more cayenne than the recipe calls for since we like our food spicey. And yes, this dish does seem a bit on the fishy side. We'll continue making it but it is only a shadow of authentic Paad Thai.

I have tried to make Paad Thai with no recipe before, and it never tasted like it does in a good Thai restaurant. although the ingredients seem unusual, the taste is authentic, and more importantly, very delicious.

This was fun to make and eat. Tasted pretty authentic.

I make this with chicken instead of the shrimp. It would also be good as a vegetarian dish with no meat. My family loves it!!

The ketchup concoction sounded strange, but turned out to be a good substitute for tamarind sauce. I added some chicken stock and cooked the noodle mixture a bit longer.

Yuk...a Thai dish turned American with the addition of Ketchup. Even calling it Paad Thai is a mistake. I will never make this again.

My Thai partner always serves this with Chinese chives (aka garlic chives) - usually on a Friday night in front of the TV with a cold beer!!

This variation has a strong fish taste as opposed to the peanut taste that I prefer.

This was a great recipe! I was pleasantly surprised to find it tasted just like my local Thai restaurant's Pad Thai! The next time I make it, I would add more bean sprouts and green onions, and will also add diced tofu. Delicious and easy to make.

Easy to make and really flavorful. The leftovers tasted great microwaved the next day too. If you never made a Thai dish before this is a great one to start with.

This is very easy to make and tastes delicious. Use of an elctric non stick wok is highly recommended. I also added chunks of take away bbq chicken to the recipe, as well as chopped fresh coriander sprinkled over the top, prior to serving. A little more liquid than recommended in the recipe was also added, as the noodles tend to absorb moisture rapidly and may dry out. Can be prepared before-hand and reheated, but tastes best when served immediately after preparation.
