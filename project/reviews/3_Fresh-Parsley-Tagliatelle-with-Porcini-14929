I have not made this recipe, but I do feel the need to comment here. To the cook in Monza, you shouldn't be rating a recipe for fresh pasta with porcini mushrooms if you didn't have porcini mushrooms and you didn't make the pasta! Porcini is a unique ingredient that does not have a substitution. Therefore you cannot be disappointed if your dish is lacking in flavor. The parsley pasta was the other half of the recipe. Feel free to cook whatever you want, but please don't rate a recipe if you have made something else altogether.

We are living temporarily in Italy, this is such a popular dish that its sold in the frozen food section at our supermarket. I tried tonight, but did not have porcini, and was bummed by the lack of flavor (but no surprise either). Otherwise easy espec. if you use a premade egg pasta.

I made the mushroom sauce and skipped the handmade pasta in the interest of time. The sauce is simple, delicious and takes only about 20 minutes to prepare. I used only about half as much oil as the recipe called for, and it worked out well.
