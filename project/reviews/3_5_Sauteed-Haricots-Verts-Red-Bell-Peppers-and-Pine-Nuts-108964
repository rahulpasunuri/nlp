This was very nice! I halved the recipe and I love garlic, so I used the full amount called for in the recipe plus an additional one. I agree with the other reviewer who recommended the addition of tarragon. It could have used a little something else.

Very easy, yet flavorful dish. This was a nice accompaniment to our Easter dinner and was a snap to prep just before serving the meal. Increasing slightly to serve 10 worked well.

These were very nice with Christmas dinner. Used 1 red and 1 yellow pepper for color contrast.

such a beautiful, easy, and delicious holiday dish. instead of dicing the bell peppers, i slice them which adds to the presentation, and i have also found that cutting back on the butter is a good idea.

Can't make this all in advance which I tried. Do ahead as previously mentioned then sautee just before serving. My beans were over cooked. My mistake. I reduced the amount of oil and butter by half and it was still more than enough. I will make again and not prep all in advance.

Perfect vegetable dish to make for almost any occasion. Very tasty and easy to make. The flavours all work well together and the three colours make a wonderfully bright addition to the table.

This is a dish I have made time and time again. It is relatively quick and easy to put together and the flavors are wonderful together. The pine nuts add a very nice flavor and crunch to the dish. And I love the red pepper, both for taste and visual appeal. I do add a nice handful of parmesan or romano at the end for added flavor and saltiness and it really rounds the dish out for me. This is a great recipe to have in your arsenal!

This was fresh and pretty and nicely complemented the richer dishes I prepared for Christmas. It is lighter made with all oil and no butter and I prefer the stronger flavor of more garlic. Boil the green beans carefully to barely crisp the day before, cool them immediately, and refrigerate overnight. The saute takes just minutes right before you serve. And Trader Joe sells frozen haricots verts which work really well.

A household favorite! Colorful and great for any time of year. Used blanched & toasted almonds instead of pine nuts.

Just made this recipe for Christmas, and it was very good. Nice clean bright flavors compliment other heavier dishes. We used slender french bean, but not true haricots verts. We found that one large red pepper was enough and chose not to add the second. Added much more garlic (that's just a matter of perference). I thought it could have used some additional herb for added complexity, maybe Tarragon. I toasted the pines nuts on a baking sheet at 325 on the rack above my ham. Will definately make again for dinner parties. Easy, versatile and very good. A keeper.

Too fatty for a side dish of vegetables. I even cut down the butter and the oil, and still felt like it was a swimming pile of cholesterol.

Very good. Too many red peppers and pine nuts compared to haricots verts. Agree with the reviewer that suggests more salt.

We love this and have made it with haricot verts and regular green beans, each time it has been great! You'll need to be generous with salt and pepper all the way through -- this is a winner!

I've made this recipe several times and each time it's hit. Even folks who don't like green beans eat it right up -- they love the haricots verts and the crunchiness of the pine nuts.

Made this today for dinner tonight, and ate half of it already! It's delicious, easy, and lovely to look at. May add more garlic next time... depending on what I serve with it.

Made this for in-laws who typically prefer their vegetables "traditional" (read mushy:) They LOVED it, as did other guests and nice-year old son. Will certainly make again!

Festive. A nice change and much lighter than the traditional green bean casserole. Used almonds instead of pine nuts.

Super easy, flavorful, and great presentation. Omitted red bell peppers and cut down a bit on the butter but that didnt seem to affect flavor. A little dash of kosher salt/pepper at they end is key. Best of all is that my picky 4 and 7 year olds ate it up!

I love the crunch that the pine nuts add.

Easy and tasty. I used frozen french green beans and skipped the bell peppers. The nuts give it a lovely crunch. You could go with all olive oil or all butter without hurting it at all.

Very good side dish. I used almonds instead of pine nuts. This makes a pretty and colorful presentation.

This was beautiful and delicious. I have made the recipe exactly as written and it was fabulous. I made it again last night using asparagus (cut into 2" pieces) instead of haricot verts and slivered almonds instead of pine nuts -- wonderful! I have also made it with regular green beans instead of haricot verts and it was equally as good. Seasoning to taste with salt and pepper is key. All variations have been winners.

Made this for Superbowl 2004 and got rave reviews from guests. I added garlic to the oil, a mix of Italian spices to the beans and peppers as they sauteed. Wonderful flavor, beautiful colors and not too many calories.

I was so disappointed in this recipe. My expectations were huge given all of the reviews. Just such a bland taste. No flavor pulled it together.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful recipe, taste wise and it was VERY easy to make. I did make a few substitutions - used skinny regular green beans instead of haricots verts, and toasted slivered almonds instead of pine nuts. Turned out magnificent and the presentation was beautiful too, since the colors are just beautiful together. Flavors work very well together too though I did use a little bit more garlic and a little less butter. We loved it!

Excellent and easy (great side with rack of lamb and gratin dauphinois). Omitted the bell pepper this time because some guests don't like them, but will add in the future.

Great recipe! Doubled the garlic, used fresh green beans (steamed & cut to 1"), sliced almonds, and one tablespoon butter. Tasty, easy, healthy, colorful!

This recipe is so delicious. Haricots vert are so hard to find and even at specialty produce markets they are often not totally fresh because the cost is so high. I was so pleased to find a 4-pound frozen pack at our local Costco - labelled Flav.R.Pac, Premium Extra Fine Green Beans. This is an excellent product for this excellent recipe. Like a previous reviewer, I briefly cook these lovely beans in the A.M. or a day ahead and pat dry. Then, with everything chopped/diced etc., there is just a last minute prep before dinner.

YUM-MEE! Ate this along side some mashed taters and a yummy steak. Would not use too much butter though; I think I overdosed - it was literally swimming in it. Not so much for healthy, but taste wise heavenly. Used almond slivers instead of pine nuts and I think I liked it better (even though I love pine nuts).

A similar version has been our regular Christmas dinner side dish for a few years now and I make it throughout the year as well. I use less red peppers and add a dash of cayenne, the secret ingrediant! I also use fresh mushrooms and instead of the pine nuts, use toasted sliced almonds, terrific!

This is absolutely fantastic - I made it a second time using asparagus and that was also yummy! Wonderful presentation - and sooo easy.

I used my gas stove to blacken the peppers. I peeled them, discarded the seeds and membranes and cut them into thin strips. I added the peppers towards the end and just reheated them. The result was delicious. Next time, I might be tempted to add a small splash of sesame oil.

Yumm! Very tasty and easy too...made the beans earlier in the day and just had to whip them out and sautee when it was time to eat! Good.

Beautiful presentation, can be made ahead, delicious combination of flavors! I made two pounds of beans for four of us at Christmas, thinking we'd have some leftover for the following day but not one bean was left! Definitely a keeper.

Even the kids ate the veggies this was so good! . Rick Rodgers hit it out of the park again with A Glitterering Christmas Dinner Bon Appetit 2003 December. We prepared the entire dinner menu beginning with the Pancetta, Leek, and Goat Cheese Tartlets and ending with an excellent chocolate-cranberry torte dessert to finish this out of the world dinner. 20 guests I love his complete menus. Always rave reviews!!!

Absolutely beautiful and equally tasty! This will be a holiday staple on my table. I boiled the haricots verts the day before Christmas...drained in cold water and wrapped them in paper towel and refrigerated them until just before dinner the next day. Then add to saute pan...and heat with red pepper mixture. Delicious and easy!

The colors are beautiful on the Xmas table, and the dish is delicious. I used 1 (1.5 lb) bag Trader Joe's frozen haricot verts, defrosted overnight. The serving bowl was very easy to clean as there was nothing left in it.

This was very good even with the Trader Joe's frozen haricots verts I used. I'm going to try for Christmas with hopefully fresh ones if I can find.

Such an easy and unique way to spice up those green beans. I substitue the red pepper with cherry tomatoes sometimes. Great with steak and a big salad!
