This was a lovely salad, but since it is so much work, all the chopping and slicing, I can only give it 3 forks.Just too much work for what you get.

Oh dear. I must agree with the other reviewer who deemed this flavorless. I made it for Easter brunch, and had to hide it in the laundry room before the guests arrive.

This was much less flavorful than I expected. The dressing was oily and flavorless, making the greens and cucumbers taste like a lot of nothing. The fruit was the only real flavor.

So delicious. Don't omit the pumpkin seeds.

I made this for lunch yesterday and it was a huge hit at work. The Napa cabbage is essential to this salad- don't leave it out. I added grilled chicken, substitued firm, unripe pears for the jicama (as I often do) and used a little less garlic (it was still plenty). A fresh summery salad. YUMMY!!

I loved the pumpkin seeds on the salad. I did not have a cucumber (it got left at the market by the checker) and I did not use cabbage, just the lettuce. With the slight changes, this salad was very nice and flavorful. We had it with barbqued burgers--yum.

Delicious salad for a spring dinner. We reduced the olive oil to 2 Tbsps and it didn't compromise the flavour. Used firm mangoes as that was all we had and they worked perfectly.

I made this last night using romaine but no cabbage and added cilantro and red onion to it. It was positively delicious and I will definitely make this again!

This salad is light and refreshing, a perfect foil for black bean soup and other spicy, hearty Latin or Southwest dishes. Guests were delighted when I served it as part of a ladies' brunch, and several asked for the recipe. When making the dressing, I use the juice of one whole lime, replace the garlic with chopped shallot, and substitute grapeseed oil for the olive oil. It yields a lot, but that's fine since the excess dressing makes a wonderful marinade, especially with a handful of chopped cilantro. Try it!

This recipe was boring. Though the different textures were nice, the mangoes just slid everywhere--I think I would leave out the mangoes and add red sliced onion or Walla Walla Sweet salad onions. It seemed like the flavors were trying too hard.

Fantastic! I like to cut everything into uniform cubes and forget the lettuce and napa. This is a great summer salad to accompany grilled foods. A bit of cilantro on top is a nice touch too.

Real good salad to go with or after grilled pork or ribs, or something "tropical style."

This is a wonderful side dish. I served it with BBQ ribs. The dressing is excellent. I would make the dressing again to serve on other salads.

I liked the salad but would make a few adjustments,such as, adding green onions or red onions, maybe some carrots cut into match stick size (same as the cucumber). Now the dressing I loved! Great flavors. Works well with the mango.

I thought that is was a pleasant salad, but I have attained better results with other jicama salads in the past. It's pretty labor intensive...

This is an excellent, easy and light salad. I don't like jicama but my husband loves it so I just took them out of my salad. I paired it with chipotle chili and cornbread for Superbowl Sunday. It was a hit. The recipe makes a very big bowl of salad.
