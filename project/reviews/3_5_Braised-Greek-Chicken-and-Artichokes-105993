Seasoned liberally with salt and pepper, chicken was sauteed in garlic- herbed olive oil. Added 2 cloves sliced garlic after sauteeing chicken. Used 1 tbsp dried oregano, added with the liquid ingredients.. After 10 minutes, added 1/4 c julienned sun- dried tomato and 2 tbsp capers. Served with jasmine rice; this was much better than weeknight, but only took 45 minutes from arrival at home. Definitely a worthy addition to the weekly menu.

Made this again for the second time. This time I followed the recipe, with only a few changes. Used almost 2 pounds skinless, boned chicken breasts and 11-12 oz chicken broth. Deglazed the pan with a little amontillado sherry. It was absolutely fabulous! The red pepper and the lemon gave it a wonderful flavor.

This is a delicious recipe that is relatively easy to prepare. I added about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic just prior to adding the artichokes. After a minute or so, I added the artichokes. Excellent!

I've made this a couple of times using shallots and garlic suggested by the last reviewer. Also added a bit of white wine to deglaze after browning the chicken. I used boneless chicken breast but I'm sure the skin and bone would be great too. This is a easy and tasty dish for weeknights. The more artichokes the merrier!

This was very simple and delicious. I did make a few modifications. Per recommendations from other reviewers, I sautéed a shallot and some garlic, removed these from the pan, and then seared the chicken (I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts). I also added extra artichoke hearts and threw in a couple of tablespoons of capers. Next time I will add a little white wine to give even more depth of flavor. Also, I used dried oregano as that was what I had on hand, but I imagine with fresh it would be even better. Enjoy!

Yummy and easy! Have made this numerous times for an easy and delicious weeknight meal. I've used boneless and skinless chicken breasts and the chicken still stays moist and tender.

This one was just okay for me - I wasn't all that impressed with the flavor I ended up with. I have other chicken recipes I like much better, so I probably will not make this one again.

I always use marinated artichoke hearts and also boneless skinless breasts. The gerber amish breasts are my favorite. I have served this many times and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe!

Simple and tasty. I added a can of diced tomatoes in juice and served over whole wheat mini bow tie pasta. Next time I'll add some garlic and onion for a little more flavor

Delicious and fairly simple. I cut boneless chicken breasts into cubes, sauted with some garlic. Used a 28oz can of petite diced tom, some capers, plus the zest from a whole lemon and the juice from half a lemon along with fresh parsley and oregono. Next time I will serve over rice. Great.

I started at the site looking for a lemon- ginger-garlic marinade and somehow ended up at this recipe... which looked so good I couldn't resist it. Since I didn't have chicken breasts, I tried this with large shrimp, and swooned. Maybe the people who feel this needs "kicking up a notch" didn't use fresh oregano, but that made all the difference. Definitely four forks, and company-worthy too!

I followed New Providence's recommendations. For half a recipe I sauteed about 1/2 c. onion, removed it from the pan and sauteed chicken. I added 1 chopped garlic clove and returned the onion to the pan along with homemade chicken broth (1/2 c), artichokes, about 3 T of the marinade, and 1 1/2 T. lime juice. Since I was serving this with peppery Green Bean, Zucchini and Potato Stew from this site, I left out the pepper and forgot the oregano. I cooked the broth down till it was syrupy and poured it and the vegetables over the chicken. Excellent and easy, this will be a repeat at our house.

Made this recipe for a family gathering and it was a hit. I followed recommendations from other reviewers and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added dry white wine, garlic, a little extra artichoke marinade, and a few capers. It was delicious and very flavorful. Even my 4 year old loved it and had three servings.

Very tasty. Not the lightest meal, but lots of sublte flavor.

Were I to make this dish again, I would use more spices and lemon zest, as I did not feel it was flavourful enough. Also, I would use boneless-chicken as it's generally easier to work with and the bone-in chicken did add enough added flavour to justify the extra effort.

We love this recipe. I used more zest, lemon juice and artichoke juice and jar oregano instead of fresh. I also used boneless chicken breasts, pounded flat. Next time, I'll try rosemary with some greek olives and feta.

Added green onion and a large mushroom, sliced, and served over cous cous. Easy weeknight meal--a nice new way with the infamous chicken breast.

Delicious! Definitely follow the advice of the reviewer from New Providence, NJ. Her modifications really improve the recipe.

I would give this a low 3. I actually used the marinated artichokes, added quarted green olives and capers. Good, but not super great. served with taboluhe salad which was really good. But this is super simple and fast. ( I used chicken tenders, not whole chicken breasts which cooked even faster)

Rating: 4
I think that the people who made this recipe and found it bland may have used canned artichokes vs. marinated in the jar. I love artichokes and was looking for a good recipe, I will make this over and over again. My only tweek was a little extra of the marinade juice and a dash more lemon. Yummy

This recipe was very disappointing and bland. I tried to improve it by adding diced tomatoes, beef broth (instead of chicken), garlic, onions and a bit of molasses, but it was still just awful. I'm only kidding; I didn't change a thing and I still didn't like it. Oh well.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I took others' advice and used boneless breasts along with thighs. Also added minced garlic with the liquid and increased red pepper and lemon juice, and was generous with salt and pepper. Wonderful served over sauteed spinach and topped with crumbled feta, pitted kalamata olives and diced tomatoes. Easy and quick.

I would definitely make this again - it was very tasty and well liked. I took the suggestion from others and added white wine to the recipe and it was very good (served over pilaf). Next time I might try mushrooms too.

Added Garlic and onions. Nice presentation but overall rather bland. Not what I generally expect from a 90+% "would make it again."

Rating: 3
Very good and fast. Like many of the reviewers I increased flavor a bit by adding some chopped garlic (just before adding the liquids)and increasing the red pepper. Orzo is a great side to soak up the fantastic juices. Also used a combo of boneless breast and thighs.

Loved this recipe - easy, delicious, and vey adaptable! Followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and deglazed the pan with white wine before adding back the browned chicken. Also used more fresh lemon juice, kalamata olives (halved) and some capers, and simmered for an extra few minutes once all of the ingredients had been added. Crumbled some feta on top, and served it over wilted baby spinach, with roasted baby Yukons on the side. Yum! Definitely a keeper.

This is a very good dish. I took the suggestion of using an onion and garlic and then deglazing the pan with white wine. It is a very!!! good suggestion. I ended up using more broth in addition to white wine which gave the dish more of a sauce. It helped to keep the chicken moist.

Rating: 3
As shown, I would give this recipe 3 forks but with the changes suggested by the cook from New Providence, NJ, it's a definite 4! This dish was the basis for a wonderfully casual lunch with friends and the children loved it too. I, too, cooked the chicken for another 20 minutes after all the ingredients were added and I believe that this enhanced the flavor further. Try this chicken, it is easy and delicious!

An excellent mediterranean meal, perfect for a hot summer's day - so eat it outside fool!!! Really quick and easy to make too, only took half an hour. Had some trouble finding the artichokes, though, but maybe I'm just a dunce.

Rating: 2
This dish has loads of potential. I advise to follow it, whil adding the feta and olives. I had fresh artichokes, so I used them. I used loads of lemon, black olives and crumbled feta. I coated the chicken strips first, as to thicken up the sauce a bit. It was soooo good.

This was a guest-worthy recipe that we tried out on ourselves last weekend. As with most of the recipes contained on this site and in the publications, you've got to be somewhat intuitive about what you like to eat and how you like to cook. This usually means modifying the recipes in some way that you know will better suit your tastes. Take a look at all of the review threads and you'll see that everyone played with the ingredients on this one --but they all pretty much came down to the same ideas for kicking this one up a few notches. For this recipe, I used a whole cut up chicken. After that was browned and removed from the pan I sauteed a large chopped onion and a couple of crushed garlic cloves till lightly golden. Then deglazed the pan with 3/4 cup white wine before returning browned chicken to pan and proceeding onto next steps. Used juice of one whole lemon. Did not have any fresh oregano and didn't want to use dried as we thought it might taste too "Italian" so I used fresh rosemary instead. We like our chicken falling of the bone, so we let it simmer for a good half hour after all the ingredients were combined. Throwing some Kalamata olives in couldn't hurt. But what I do instead with dishes like this is serve orzo with chopped Kalamatas mixed into that. . Anyway, this one's a keeper. And it's a pretty simple one, too.

This was an excellent dish, however it required some modification. After reading some previous reviews, I added a couple cloves of garlic, kalamata olives and twice the lemon. I also sprinkled feta cheese on the chicken upon serving. I used skinless chicken breasts but be careful not to cook the chicken too long as the breasts will be dry.

Excellent dish and works well for a dinner party. I added kalamata olives, garlic and twice the amount of lemon and it was fantastic.

I added ouzo (a Greek liquor) along with the chicken broth. I also added kalamata olives. The ouzo and olives gave the dish some extra zip.

Rating: 3
Great recipe! Goes well with Feta cheese sprinkled on top when it's finished. Next time i am going to add more of the ingredients to the sauce so that i can pour some in a serving bowl to dip my potatoes in. I think I will also add some flour to thicken the sauce.

Bland and boring. Served with an orzo recipe also on this site and that's what everyone ate up - the chicken was left on everyone's plates, bleh!

Rating: 2
This was good but not great. I used bonless, skinless breasts and besides having to cut down the cooking times they seemed to work great. I thought it went very well with orzo, which I hadn't tried in this manner previously (usually had it in soups). I really like the texture of it.

Rating: 3
Was a great dish! I used 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives, and I marinaded my chicken in EV olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, oregano, salt, pepper, and a bit of Kalamata brine. Served with minted orzo leftover from a lamb dinner a few nights ago, this was the perfect departure from lamb as we still had a lot of orzo leftover :)

I loved it. I did use boneless, skinless, breasts. I used less peel and more juice and I added the Kalamata olives and also sun-dried tomatoes. The olives do give it a "blast" of flavor! Thanks for everyone's help.

i used boneless chicken breasts rather than bone in. It came out pretty well...I agree that the flavors were not too pronounced but it was a great mid week meal. Did not used the lemon rind and used dried oregano ratehr than fresh.

Rating: 2
A pretty tasty dish generally speaking. The flavors weren't too pronounced, instead it was a mild flavor that was very pleasant. If I were to make this dish again, I would use more lemon juice and less rind. I would also include possibly some rosemary in addition to just the oregano. I would also use organic chicken stock (low sodium is a plus) and also maybe throw in a few kalamata olives for an additional flavor blast.
