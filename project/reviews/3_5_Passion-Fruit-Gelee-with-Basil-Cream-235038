I found this as part of the Francophile Vegetarian Feast menu. FYI, gelatin is not a vegetarian ingredient. Agar is usually a suitable substitute. I love this flavour combination, so I hope it works well with agar.

Yum! I made only the gelée, and put it on top of coconut tapioca pudding. It was really refreshing. I will surely use this recipe for "jello" with other liquids.

This baby rocked! took a little more time than i like but this is why i typically don't do desserts. I was really happy with it in the end and my guests flipped out. I also made them with Looza mango juice, was good but no where near as good as the passion fruit.

Great recipe, very unique and not as 'out-there' as you might think the basil cream is absolutely delicious. A couple tips though, use slightly more water when dissolving the gelatin as 2T is not very much and it can clump. Second, strain each mixture if you at all concerned about gelatim clumps. No biggie, just a aesthetic thing. Lastly, it takes a long time for these to set, they should be made a day early. You can partially freeze the gelee layer and then pour on the cream layer to help move things along if you are short of time. By the time the cream has set, the gelee has thawed. I tried fresh passionfruit, but it was too bitter. Enjoy !

I used fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh lemon basil..it was delicious and a pleasant change,served it for a mother- daughter spa date at my house..perfect!

I made this recipe as is and my guests raved. It was a nice refreshing finish. I had a little problem with bubbles in the gelee and my basil cream got a little thick, but it still looked neat and the flavors were wonderful.

Quite delicious and beautiful to boot! I love the combination of tart passionfruit with the sweet basil cream. The gelee didn't set up as quickly as I thought it would but I made it well in advance so it was fine. I used old=fashioned lemonade glasses and set them in an egg carton, slightly tilted, to get the dramatic effect.

This dessert is fabulous. It tastes great and looks amazing. It can be tricky to find the right glasses. We used glasses from a coffee set with removable metal handles. Although you want to have a dramatic line between the 2 layers, make sure you don't create too sharp an angle. Otherwise, you won't have enough cream to reach the top. I liked this so much that we will make it again this week for a special dinner.

Light, enchanting, and so good! The basil is a welcome change to overused mint! The passionfruit jello was delicious, the basil cream awesome!

Worse than "so-so". The first time I made this, I used mango nectar. The gelee never set up by the time guests arrived 8 hours later. By the next AM gelee had the consistency of thick mango mucus. Before rating this, I decided to try again with double the gelatin and used mango/peach nectar. Needed a little more sweetening but this time set up too thickly. Very subtle fruit and nice basil flavor -- but it was basically jello. This will be an excellent science project for my 9 year old demonstrating that you can make jello out of almost anything

I couldn't find passion fruit nectar, so I used apricot instead. The cream part of the dessert is very heavy so I would suggest putting only a thin layer of it on top of the gelee. Otherwise, it makes for a nice filling snack.

This dessert was stunning!!! I made it for my parents' anniversary dinner and my mother said that she could have believed that it had come from one of the best restaurants in Seattle. I did have some trouble getting the gelee to set up enough and my cream set too much, so the end product didn't look picture perfect, but it still tasted fabulous. This is absolutely my new favorite dessert and I recommend it to any and everyone!

I used half Mango nectar and half Papaya nectar, it was a hit both times I made it...perfect for a hot summer night!

Definitely will be making this again but I couldn't find passionfruit nectar..used passionfruit juice and next time will increase amount of gelatin as gelee was a bit soft.I wanted a very strong basil favor so steeped the basil in the cream while the first layer was setting.. and the cream became more beige than white! still looked good but if you want the really crisp white contrast then don't let it sit. I agree this could be used with a variety of fruit nectars...my first thought was mango and thai basil. I made this for company ( my first ever serving of jello for company!) and it certainly complemented the prawn curry we had as a main.

Fantastic and elegant recipe. I used pineapple nectar in lieu of passion fruit, which I couldn't find. I will definitely experiment with this one. Pear nectar/mint, Coconut/vanilla, etc. This is a very easy, good looking dessert with endless possibilities! Adding juice to gelatin is easy enough and then some cream on top to boot! Simple.

Wow, this is quite good! This looked beautiful, so I decided I just had to make it. However, once I saw that it had a basil cream, I worried it might be a bit strange, but I wanted to be adventurous and try it anyway. While I thought this was good, I think I will make a few changes for next time--use mint instead of basil, & use half&half instead of heavy cream. I really think those differences will make this recipe even better!! A note--if you can't find passion-fruit nectar, passion-fruit juice will work well, too.
