Leave it to my son to ask for a blueberry cake for his birthday,and since he loves lemons, I thought this would be perfect. Absolutely delicious. I did sub 1/2 cup of milk for 1/2 c sour cream for depth, added another teaspoon of lemon extract and more lemon zest to the batter. I added more zest to the frosting as well. Topped with candied lemon peel...simple but worth it.

This cake is amazing. I tinted the frosting with yellow food coloring and decorated it with blueberries that I had tossed in a little egg white/water combination and covered with superfine sugar. Put the berries in the refrigerator and chill. They are gorgeous and taste like little candies with a juice berry interior. It was absolutely gorgeous!

I used this recipe for my daughter's wedding cake and received rave reviews. I used lemon curd for the filling. and a white fondant flavored with a little lemon. It was beautiful as well as delicious. I am so thankful I found this recipe. (The lemon cream cheese frosting was excellent under the fondant.)

I altered this recipe a tiny bit by adding a thin layer of lemon curd between the cake layers. My family and friends RAVED about it. The cake was super moist and the flavors were spectacular! I will be making this cake again and again.

my mistake. this is a dense [but truly moist] brunch-type-cake, not a birthday cake and I suppose I'm too much of a novice baker to tell that from eyeballing the recipe. now I'm that much closer to being able to eyeball fluffy.... [as a brunch cake it was lovely [but I think a lemon glaze would be more fitting than the frosting is], but I'm docking it stars on my dashed expectations anyway. it can handle it!]

Rating: 4
this recipe is easy to make, packed with flavor, and the cake is so impossibly moist! I put a bit less confectioners sugar in the frosting than the recipe called for which kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet. I'm trying to come up with special occasions just so I can make this cake again.

Rating: 2
I wasn't super impressed with this cake, but I am sure it's tastier and more flavorful with icing. I just made the muffins for a friend who doesn't like really sweet things. The lemon didn't really "pop", so I think it could use more. It seems like too many eggs are in here. My blueberries didn't sink, so that was good. This cake is just ok without frosting.

Rating: 4
omg - the batter was delish!!! Always a good sign :) I made 24 cupcakes (baked 22 min - oven's a little slow) and they're excellent! Delicate and flavorful. I made a few minor changes: CAKE: added 1/4 tsp lemon extract and processed the rind of 1 whole lemon with the sugar before creaming it with the butter. FROSTING: used 2 sticks of butter; subbed 2 TB lemon juice for the peel and upped the vanilla to 2 tsp. An excellent cake that I whole-heartedly endorse for anyone who wants a nice summery cake.

I made this recipe for a beach picnic, so I didn't want to deal with layers. I made the full recipe and poured a little more than 1/2 into a glass oval baking dish, 13" x 8.5" and baked for around 35 minutes. It was light and fluffy and really, really good (loved even by my picky husband and even pickier daughter). I did not have any issues with a flat cake or sinking berries, but I used extra large eggs for more fluff and also was hyper-vigilant about not over mixing--did a lot of folding during the mixing process. I used King Arthur Cake Flour, room temp milk and eggs, tripled the lemon peel and also coated the berries while they were still slightly wet from washing. It was easy and really, really good. I'll make this cake over and over again. It would be gorgeous with some lavender laying on the top or some edible flowers for a little elegance.

I made cupcakes out of this recipe instead of a cake and they were a hit with the party. I used frozen blueberries, 3X more lemon zest than the cake and frosting recipes call for, and cooked them for 20 minutes. Both the cake and the frosting were delicious! They do not rise up very much, if at all, but they still taste light and fluffy.

To dillonal from Portland: it's possible that your butter is the wrong temperature. If you are microwaving it to get it to "room temperature" it may be too warm. I screwed up so many cookies this way! I read that if you microwave in 5 second increments until it just begins to soften, that should get you to room temperature without over-warming.

NO FORKS! I have never been more disappointed in a cake! All of the blueberries ended up gummily on the bottom of all the layers, despite following directions to the letter. I can't imagine serving this cake to *anyone*.

This is a delicious summery cake! It received rave reviews from all of my friends. My boss actually blurted out "that's incredible!" after his first bite, right in the middle of a meeting! I wanted something a bit more portable, so I made an 8x8 sheet cake with part of the batter, and cupcakes with the rest (I got about 20 cupcakes out of it). Both came out very well. I cooked the cupcakes for about 20 minutes; the 8x8 cake took nearly 40 minutes to fully set. Like other reviewers, I added lemon juice to both the cake batter and frosting. I think it would be too light on lemon flavor without it. I was a bit worried about blueberries sinking, so I froze my fresh blueberries for about 10 minutes, coated them with the flour mixture, and then folded them in. It worked like a charm; the blueberries were mixed in all throughout the cake. Also, I cut the frosting recipe in half and *still* had some left over! Even for a big layer cake, I don't see how you would ever want the full frosting recipe.

I've made this cake twice now and while the flavor is great - I can't get the cake to rise. I purchased new baking powder, didn't overbeat the batter, etc. and have had no luck. Maybe I am missing something?

I am making this cake again (for the 4th time) for my husband's August birthday...we always use fresh blueberries from our garden (which cuts down on cost of buying them), and make the cake exactly as the recipe says to. Blueberries do not sink if dusted with flour and gently folded in. Cake is moist beyond belief, but not dense as in heavy. It's fresh and clean and absolutely the best cake I've ever made. It's a blue ribbon cake!

I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday in Germany and it was a huge hit. I was very happy with the recipe. Yes, the frosting is runny and it should be kept in the refrigerator until right before serving and the blueberries go to the bottom but so what? The "runny" frosting made for an elegant cake when served on a beautiful platter and tasted wonderful!!! I received lots of compliments. p.s. if you are making it in Germany, for the cake use 405 flour, add 1/4 C extra flour and double the baking powder.

I made this cake for a friend's party and everyone loved it. I coated the blueberries in flour as instructed and did not over-fold them into the batter, but they still sunk to the bottom. I wasn't a huge fan of the cream cheese frosting paired with the cake. Although I enjoyed the cake, I think I would opt for a different recipe next time.

Rating: 4
This is the most elegant, universally crowd-pleasing cake I have in my arsenal. It's expensive to make (I figure the whole thing comes to somewhere ca. $15-20 depending on season), but it tastes like anything you'd get at a high-end bakery. If you're having trouble with blueberries falling, consider tossing them with 1T of the flour before folding into batter. Also, DON'T FORGET TO REMOVE PARCHMENT BEFORE STACKING AND ICING CAKE. Ay yay yay.

this cake is delicious. the secret to keeping the cake from being too dense is not to over stir the batter.also I only used 3 cups of sugar for frosting instead of 4, and it came out perfect.

I made this cake for my aunt's 80th birthday and everyone loved it! It is a dense cake but very moist and flavorful.I added 1 tsp. Creme Bouquet (a citris flavored flavor enhancer) to both the cake and the frosting (I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe). This enhancer made the cake more flavorful and added a nice citris flavor to the frosting (I omitted the lemon peel in the frosting).

I'm sorry, this was a real bust. "Dense" only begins to describe the cake -- it simply did not rise, period. No problem with the blueberries sinking to the bottom -- there was nowhere else for them to go, there being no top! A major disappointment, as the flavor was excellent, and the frosting absolutely delicious -- I always thought I didn't care for cream cheese frosting, but apparently if there's enough butter in it, I do!

Frosting is delicious, added lemon juice and more zest-cake is good, needs a little more zing! All in all, an impressive cake for minimal effort.

Rating: 3
The frosting was amazingly delicious, and I had high hopes for the cake, but it left something to be desired. I used strawberries instead of blueberries as a few others did, but everything else was by the recipe, and the cake was *very* dense, and had an indeterminate flavor, despite the addition of twice as much lemon zest and a little lemon juice. I may try to tinker with the recipe; the frosting is definitely a keeper, but not sure about the cake.

My cake turned out very dense. I thought I had messed something up until I re-read the other comments and saw that was a common theme. But the flavor was great. I used fresh blueberries and put lemon curd in between the layers instead of the cream cheese frosting.

This cake was wonderful! I used half blueberries (frozen) and half raspberries (fresh), and it looked great. The only other adjustment I made was to double the lemon zest in the cake and in the frosting. The berries did sink a bit, but this did not detract from the presentation.

Made this for my dad for his birthday. Yes, it's dense consistency, but it tastes completely amazing. I didn't have an issue with blueberries falling to the bottom of my cakes, but doubt it would have bothered me if I had. I got 3 cakes out of it and it looked lovely all together. And I loved the frosting. Didn't have any issues spreading it and the cake looked lovely. I had a TON of frosting left over though, so when I make this again I might half that recipe.

I've not tried this recipe but I plan to. It sounds wonderful! A tip for Melanie from Albuquerque: Before folding in the blueberries, roll them in flour until they are somewhat coated. This "should" prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the cake during baking.

Rating: 3
To Alburquerque, yes you can freeze it, at least for a short period. I made this for my husband's 40th...guest list was for 90. I made the recipe and a half for a 12X16 pan, then made 3 layers. Froze it for about a week with great results (saran and tin foil) You can just triple the icing and that will be enough. I would decrease the amount of blueberries next time as they sunk to the bottom and made the cake a bit soggy. Still, I was thrilled with results and would do it again for a big crowd.

I usually gravitate towards chocolate desserts, but this is my new favorite cake. People at work raved about it too--so much that I've been asked to make it again for our next office birthday luncheon. Like other bakers, I also add some lemon juice (about 2T) to the cake batter and the frosting to add more lemony flavor.

Excellent. I substituted carefully cut strawberries for the blueberries and tossed them with a bit more of the flour. I also added 1/4 tsp natural lemon extract to both the cake and the frosting and doubled the lemon zest for both. Lovely texture and delicious taste. The frosting is a bit sweet so you might want to cut the sugar, depending on your preference.

I made this for a kids birthday party,,,the adults really liked it but the kiddos didnt. The berries sunk to the bottom and the cake was very heavy, I made it into two layers and made a lightly sweetened creamcheese frosting. It was expensive to make (organic)and I wasnt thrilled with it which could have been due to my baking skills..next time I'll go more simple.

Absolutely wonderful. I got scads of compliments when I made this for a dinner party. If you beat the batter as the directions state, you will have a nice light cake. Also, frosting would have been to sweet with all that sugar. Added a little lemon juice to make frosting more lemony.

I didn't find this to be as wonderful as many of the reviews. It was a lot of work for the results: a blueberry lemon pound cake. Like another reviewer mentioned- even with flouring the blueberries, they sunk to form a ribbon of blueberry on the bottom of each layer.

First made (and reviewed) this recipe 5 years ago. Since then I have made it many times - even won grand prize in a bake-off at my office. Each time has been delicious but mixed results ... 1/2 the time lighter than air and amazing (hence my grand prize) the other half more like a pound cake - both are delicious and never a crumb left, but haven't figured out why the mixed results!

I just made this for a friend's birthday and it was a HUGE it-- even non-lemon-lovers found it light and not too overwhelming, and I had added extra lemon zest to both frosting and batter. I served it with berries, sherbet and an edible flower on top. The excess frosting is an extra treat between graham crackers later too!

Even after all of the incredible reviews, I was still a bit leary of this cake, but it was my mother-in-law's birthday and these are her two favorite flavors. I used frozen blueberries and only made two layers. I took the advice of the other reviews and added more lemon zest to the cake batter and more lemon zest and lemon juice to the frosting. The outcome, an AMAZING cake. It is the consistency of a pound cake, and I was prepared for that from the other reviews. She kept asking where I got the cake and I had to keep telling her I made it. She just could not beileve it (I don't know what that says about how she feels about my cooking). And, she has not stopped talking about it since her birthday dinner. I would highly recommend this cake to anyone who loves these flavors!

I find the cake fluffier than I usually like my cakes, and dusting the blueberries in flour has never really "suspended" the blueberries evenly. Nevertheless, this is a great (late) summer cake.

this cake was delicious! i only needed to use two 9-inch pans instead of three. the layers were just over an inch thick. the cake and frosting had a great lemony flavor with the amount of zest called for. the only problem i had was with the frosting - there was too much of it and it was runny. i would recommend making half the recipe (especially if your cake is two layers) and adding more powdered sugar to thicken it up. i did refrigerate the frosting as directed, however, after a 30 minute car ride to another home, the top layer had slid right off because of the melting frosting! if you can keep the cake refrigerated until 30 min. before eating, you should have no problems.

Rating: 4
I made this without the frosting. My 4 year old wanted "blueberry cake" for his family birthday cake. I just pulled the leftovers from the freezer a month later and it is STILL moist and delicious. Subtle flavor (I did add more zest than called for) but definitely has a lemon taste. As for the reviews who worried or complained about cake density - NOTE this is a basic POUND cake with blueberries! Another delicious pound cake I really like is Barefoot Contessa's Orange Pound Cake -which can be Googled if you don't have her cookbook.

Everyone loves this cake and it looks great! Yes, you do need to keep this cake cool and the frosting can be slippery. You can use toothppicks or perhaps a screwer to hold layers together and remove once on the table for serving. The forsting can be brushed over the hole. I had to search for this recipe online - but I think I originally found this in my BA magazine before 2001.

I made this cake for a dinner party and got rave reviews. The cake is very dense, but the 3 rather short layers makes a lovely presentation. I added MORE sugar to the frosting, plus some lemon juice, so it was easier to work with...less slippery. The added lemon juice cut down on the sugary taste and had a nice tartness. I also added more lemon zest than called for, which I always do. More is better. I refrigerated the cake before and during frosting, as well as refrigerating the frosting, and kept the cake refrigerated afterwards. It would travel fine if it is cold and taken in an appropriate cake carrier. I also served it with home-made lemon ice cream and a mixed berry coulis....very very lovely.

After reading the other reviews on how slippery the frosting could be I modified the assembly a bit. I made the cake and frosting the night before and refrigerated both. The next morning, with both the cake and frosting cold, I assembled the cake without a problem. I again refrigerated it until time to eat and everyone had seconds.

I have made this cake many times since it was printed and have never had anything but rave reviews. If you adjust according to add a fourth layer to the cake, it's particularly beautiful. Also, a little more lemon peel in the frosting is recommended.

Tried this tonight, adding more lemon zest to both cake and icing and still found it lacking on the lemon flavor. Overall it was good, but I think I was anticipating a good lemony tartness in the icing and cake to balance the blueberry flavor. Also found the blueberries sank to the bottom - maybe there is a way to solve this issue, but I haven't found it yet. Overall it was sort of like a muffin-y cake. Ok, but needs work, or maybe just another recipe...

My husband made this cake for me for my birthday. We would only make it again for a large group, because it's very dense and a small slice is all anyone needs (or would want - because I'm usually a dessert glutton.) I would say it would easily serve 20. The frosting was DELICIOUS. Absolutely scrumptious. He did do what was recommended and increased the amount of lemon peel, which was a good idea.

I couldnt wait to make this cake to take to a dinner at some friends'. It was really easy and the cake looked gorgeous-decorated with white choc stars and blueberries and orange and lemon zest. I used the lower amt of sugar as prescribed by a reviewer and tinted the frosting pale yellow. It was delicious but the cake layers were heavy and too moist. SO I obviously did something wrong in mixing the batter but I wont lose any sleep-will just make it again another time. I would add way more lemon zest to the icing and cake for more punch. This is definitely one cake I want to make again.

Really good cake. I made it in a baking pan, I understand why they suggest 2-3 round cake pans. The blueberries fall to the bottom- this would make a pretty presentation in layers.

Wow. I had some doubts after reading the reviews, but made this for a dessert buffet, incorporating some of the suggestions, and it was a huge hit. Reduced the sugar in the icing, and added a little lemon juice and yellow food coloring to make it a little more "lemon-y." My only criticism is that (probably due to my addition of lemon juice) the frosting didn't pipe well at all - after a few attempts I gave up and just decorated it with a little mound of blueberries in the center. It was attractive and delicious.

My husband baked this for my birthday, and it was soooo good. Very tender and light. A fabulous change from the ubiquitous chocolate cake. For all you Canadian bakers, I was worried that what we call cake-and-pastry flour would not be the same as what Bon Appetit calls cake flour. I don't know if it is or isn't but, the C&P flour worked great. My husband informed me that he cut the powdered sugar down to 2 1/2 cups, and upped the zest in the icing slightly. I will not be sharing the leftovers!

What a pretty and yummy cake. My family was so impressed at this birthday cake. I also added a little yellow food colouring to the icing to make it more "lemony".

Sprinkle with a few blueberries and lemon zest on top, and voila, it looks like a professional cake.

I thought this recipe was okay. The biggest problem was the lack of flavor in the icing. I cut the sugar by 1/3 so it wouldn't be so sweet, but the lemon flavor was very weak. Maybe the lemons I used didn't have a lot of flavor in the rind???

You have to make this cake! I made it for my mother for Mothers Day and it was delicious and beautiful. I also cut the powdered sugar in half which makes the frosting tangier and I think that complements the cake better. I think this is one of the best cakes I've ever made - I highly recommend it. I do wish I could think of a better way to garnish it . . .

This cake came out very moist and soft. I wanted to comment that I had room for 3 very thin layers. I was worried at first when I was filling the pans and I changed my mind between 2 and 3 pans several times. But I stuck with 3 layers... it came out fine... I think thin layers are more elegant. And it means that the cake and frosting are integrated more. Also, next time I make this cake, I'll cut the frosting recipe either in half or to two-thirds. I like to have thin layers of frosting.

Fabulous, fabulous recipe. Made this as a birthday cake, and *everyone* raved. Used only 2 cups sugar in cream cheese frosting, and it was perfect. Substituted 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour + 4 tbsp cornstarch for the 2 cups cake flour, then got lazy and just added the remaining 6 tbsp all purpose flour. Used good frozen blueberries (thawed and well washed to avoid color leakage) instead of fresh. One of the best cakes I've ever made.

Fantastic!! Lovely presentation when the cake is cut. I had people fighting over the last piece, and I've been "ordered" to make it again for a party this weekend. I agree with the comments on the icing. The amount of sugar called for is WAY too much. 2.5 to 3 cups is just fine. Final word- a user friendly recipe that gets great results.

Excellent cake! I even used frozen blueberries, as I couldn't find fresh around here right now. I can't imagine it being any better! (1 bag was 3 cups) A note on the icing--we loved it, although it did overpower the subtile lemon flavor of the cake. I think for this cake, I'll decrease the sugar next time, but I may leave it alone if I was using it on another cake.

I made this cake for the faculty at my school and it got incredible raves from teachers and students. This is definitely going into my personal recipe file.

I made this cake for a baby shower tea party and it was absolutely fabulous! Everyone loved it! It was not tart, a nice balance of lemon and blueberry. The cake itself was fluffy and moist, not dense. For the cream cheese frosting I used 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 3/4 cups. It turned out buttery, creamy sweet, not too sugary. Easy cake to put together. I recommend it to all!

This was WONDERFUL!!! I made it for my Mom's 70th birthday, she loves lemon so it was a sure-fire hit! It looks just beautiful when cut so the presentation is fabulous. Everyone loved the icing (I followed the recipie exactly), so I also used it (without the lemon) for my parents 50th Anniversary cake 2 weeks later.

This cake was pretty and delicious (and tasted even better the next day), but I only had enough batter for 2 nine inch layers. Did anyone else find that to be the case?

Changed frosting due to reviews about richness. This is light and lemony. 2 8 oz pckgs cream cheese, room temperature 2 teaspoons lemon juice 1 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel 3/4 cup powdered sugar Beeat cream cheese until light and fluffy. Slowly add powdered sugar, then add lemon juice and lemon peel.

While vacationing in Prince Edward Island, I entered this in a local contest at a Chowder Party. I picked the blueberries myself. Won Third Prize!

This was a beautiful cake that I made for my husband's birthday. I would have liked a little more lemon flavor,though. My kids (10 and 7) scarffed it up.

I made this for daughter's first birthday party--it was the first piece of cake she ever ate. Everyone at the party loved it, and my sister requested it two weeks later for her birthday. I upped the lemon rind in the frosting as a way to cut the richness. I decorated the cake with candied violets, and the effect was really sweet. Candied lilacs would be even more beautiful. Another note--don't be afraid to refrigerate the cake--I think it improves when chilled.

Have not made this cake yet but had trouble finding the frosting recipe until I did a search. The hyper link had the wrong URL. It's just one digit off but every time you click on the frosting, it brought you back to the cake recipe. The correct URL is 105378, not 105375! Please take note web master!

Loved it! Wonderful texture and beautiful presentation. Made it for my mother's birthday, and my dad, who really doesn't care for cake, even had a second piece. It's a keeper!!

I made this for my father's 88th birthday party, and everyone loved it. Dad isn't a chocolate person, so this cake was a perfect substitute. I used probably a teaspoon and a half of lemon zest and grated it on the larger holes of my grater. I think that gave it a very nice yet not overpowering lemon taste. I didn't make the icing recipe as I had to decorate the cake, so here is a tip for you cake decorators out there: I did this cake in light yellow frosting and covered it in icing violets. It looks smashing when you cut the cake!

turned out great, the cake was very light and moist. Received rave reviews the recipe for the icing was an enormous quantity, I went heavy and still had alot left over.

This is a fair amount of effort but pretty good results. the icing recipe is very rich and you don't actually require as much as it calls for...I had over a cup extra. be sure that the layers are completely cooled before layering...I was impatient and cracked the middle layer which made for a disastrous presentation.
