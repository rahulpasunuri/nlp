Used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. Good solid recipe but nothing outstanding but wouldn't hesitate to make again. Served with BA Parmesan Bread Pudding with Broccoli Rabe and Pancetta.

Excellent! I used Rosemary fresh from the garden and cooked perfectly on a very hot grill. Served with red, roasted potatoes, grilled asparagus, grilled zucchini, and a fresh baguette. Paired with a great French Syrah. This meal is a keeper.

Delicious!!! As suggested by other reviewers substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine and grilled on a Le Creuset grill pan. Served with roasted baby potatoes and a simple green salad.

I used boneless sirloin veal chops. Other than that followed the recipe. Cooked on the grill. Absolutely delicious! I'm lucky in that we have an absolutely wonderful organic, free range butcher here in columbus Ohio (bluescreek farm at the North Market). They will let you know when they will have a veal if you ask them. This is a wonderful and simple preparation for a special cut of meat. I served it with spring greens topped with lemon juice, olive oil, fresh ground pepper and thinly sliced gruyere. Also served garlic rubbed bread toasted on the grill and pickled asparagus. The meal was a big hit!

Like many others, used the basalmic and worked perfectly; would probably skip the wine next time. The basalmic added more complexity and a slight bit of sweetness. Served with broccoli Roman style - sauteed with garlic and a little lemon zest and juice at the end - and made for a great combo. Very nice warm weather dinner.

We enjoyed this preparation but I think it shone because of the quality of the veal - not necessarily the marinade. While tasty (and I would make it again) it wasn't a complex flavor - maybe a few pepper flakes would help jazz it up a bit?

Easy and tasty. The basalmic vinegar instead of wine was a good suggestion.

Delightful! I used the balsamic vinegar as suggested, found rib chops that were over 1 inch thick, and ended up with succulent, delicately flavored chops.

Used the balsamic but otherwise did exactly as stated and it was beyond awesome!!! Soooo easy yet incredible flavor. Can't wait to try it out on my parents this week....veal chops two times in one week....lucky me!!

This was simple and delicious. I followed the directions and used only the best ingredients - fine wine, great olive oil, fresh rosemary and good meat. The results were spendid. Moist and tender. Served with sauteed spinach. Great weeknight meal.

This was perfect for New Yearès Eve. Set the veal to marinade and enjoyed the evening until time to grill (yes we BBQd on Dec 31st in Ontario!). Used balsamic as advised. Nice flvour, but I felt something was missing.....

Ruined prime veal when making this the first time by over-broiling the meat - save yourself the same mistake! The second time it was delicious, cooked perfectly on the grill.

This is one of those "duh" recipes -- once you come to understand what melds best with veal (rosemary; olive oil), you just do it. I do agree, though, that balsamic is better than wine. Just not too much. This is all about the beef, so don't skimp. But it's tough to call this a real recipe.

On the advice of others, I substituted balsamic vinegar for wine and the veal was excellent. It was an easy quick meal with lots of flavor. A definite keeper even worthy of serving to guests.

This dish is similar to my favorite never-fail treatment of veal chops, and works beautifully with pork chops as well. Remove the wine from this recipe and use just a splash of balsamic vinegar (I use Lulu's Fig Balsamic), and rub the combined ingredients all over your chops. No need to bathe the chops in a pool of liquid - just enough olive oil and balsamic to coat and moisten them. A bit of sage or thyme also enhances the flavor nicely. I honestly believe that leaving out the wine elevates this recipe to four forks.

Very easy, and very good. I am into quick, good and easy, and this fills the bill on all counts. It is even good enough to serve to company.

So simple, but so very good! I usually go for more exotic recipes for expensive veal chops, but this was great. I also substituted balsamic vinegar for part of the wine.

Welcome summer! With apologies to George (Foreman), this dish demands outdoor cooking. The slight smokiness and caramelization imparted by a really hot gas or charcoal fire lend flavor notes that complement the garlic and rosemary. I substituted 2 Tbl. balsamic vinegar for the wine, which I think helps with the browning without being either too sweet or too sour. I agree that the timing is a bit too short: 5-7 min. per side, depending on thickness, is more reasonable. Served with a salad, pasta with basil pesto, and a nice Chianti Classico. Molto delizioso!

I was disappointed in this dish. It didn't taste bad; it just didn't taste like much of anything at all. The veal was tender and flavorful, but the marinade didn't add anything. I was expecting a little tartness from the wine and a more pronounced herb flavor. Instead I just tasted meat, salt, and pepper.

This was quick and easy!! Flavor was pretty good, but I have better.

This is quick and easy, and I didn't think that the marinade (with the wine) overpowered the taste of the veal. This was one of the first things I attempted with my new George Foreman grill, and I shall definately be doing it again.

After the first time I prepared veal chops this way, my husband told me to stop looking for any other veal chop recipes; this was the one he wanted every time! It's wonderful, and SO easy.

Very good.I've also used pork tenderloin chops and its come out good too.Also thanks so much for the suggestion about the Sangiovese.It was a real hit.

Oh YUCK! This was terrible. The red wine was a bad idea, it made the (expensive cut of) veal taste sour - and no the wine was not off, which was my first thought. Leave out the red wine and just marinate with olive oil, garlic and rosemary - beautiful. A shame though, it sounded so good!

These were the most unbelievable delicious pieces of meat I have ever eaten! fresh rosemary is a must, along with a quality piece of meat. Well worth it! As good as lobster!!

There are better recipes on this site for veal chops but this one is SO EASY. Some nice garden tomatoes and a green veggie complement the chops.

Great and simple. I marinated about 2 hours at room temperature. Substituted fresh tarragon for the rosemary, and topped with garlic butter molded into little shell shapes. Yum. Will make this often on the grill.

I have made the recipe several times since discovering it online. I was amazed at how wonderful it tasted, and even more so considering the minimum amount of effort put in. Simple roasted new potatoes, steamed green beans and a nice merlot are a great accompaniment.

Very easy to prepare and very tasty. The chops needed closer to 10 minutes per side for medium rare.
