Try this ! All you need add are some baked potatoes and maybe some sauteed mushrooms and you're in business.

I made this for my boyfriend for a "special evening." He couldn't stop raving about it! Said the horseradish sauce was just right and the grilling instructions were perfectly right-on. I served it with portabello mushroom ravioli in garlic white wine sauce and caesar salad. Will definitely try this again when guests are over!

I'm surprised to see this recipe here since the horseradish cream is a classic condiment for roast beef and I've been making it for most of my "cooking" life. We make it every New Year to serve with roast prime rib of beef and Yorkshire pudding, our traditional English NY fare. I even use this sauce to give a kick to burgers. One note on the steaks - if I have to grill them inside, I use a ridged grill pan as noted in the recipe, but after searing, instead of putting a lid over the meat, I put the steaks, still in the pan, into a 350 degree oven for a few minutes to finish a desired. To me, putting a lid or cover on the pan makes the steak steam a bit - but, whatever floats your boat!

Wow! Couldn't be better or easier! Made my NY strips phenomenal! Will certainly make again!

Sauce is marvelous. Turns a patty of ground chuck into a feast.

Wow! Wow! Wow! The Horesradish Cream is out of this world delicious. I thought the guys at the table were going to lick the bowl it was in, and I must admit it took a little self-control on my part not to be a total pig, too. I cut the recipe in half because I was only serving 3 diners, but if I had made the whole batch we would have consumed it. Perfect as is!
