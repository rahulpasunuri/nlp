My family raved about this pie at Thanksgiving. I didn't find it overly boozy as some reviews did, and I also did not find the crust to be soggy (and I did not prebake the crust). I ended up with a flaky crust filled with a delicious custard-like pumpkin pie filling, with just the right hint of brandy. I did, however, follow advice to not over fill the pie, and instead poured some of the extra into a ramekin. I baked the ramekin along with the pie for ~20-25 minutes, and ended up with a nice pumpkin custard treat.

Thanks to others' reviews, I decided on an 11" pie dish, which was the right size for all the filling. No rim, though, so I had to skip the fancy edge. I tried blind baking the crust, but it shrank in just 10 minutes. Luckily it was repairable, and stayed put during baking, which took 50 minutes. And I used Calvados, which turned out to be a good idea. We all loved the pie because of the subtlety of the flavors, and the maple cut-outs made for a special presentation - but I have to say that the ginger whipped cream was what made it outstanding.

I've been making this pie since Gourmet published it in '92. It's got a lot of pumpkin flavor, isn't overly sweet, and the booze complements the pumpkin nicely. You need to be aware of several things, though: the filling won't set up properly if you try to use all the filling (which is impossible) and fill the crust to the brim. The recipe makes enough filling for 2 old-fashioned pies (8 inch + not deep dish). I also recommend using old-fashioned sized pie plates (or at least a shallower pie) for achieving a good crust. It's not the recipe for the pate brisee that's the problem, it's all the liquid soaking into it while you try to get the pie to set up. You could also blind bake the crust. I've substituted rum, cognac, whiskey and an Islay scotch for the brandy. All them were good, but the Islay scotch was, predictably, too strong for all but the biggest scotch lovers. Personally, I think cognac works best. The ginger cream is very good with this as well as other pies.

I also found the final pie to be overly boozy and not custardy enough. One recommendation for this or any similar pie is to whisk the spices and pumpkin together before adding more wet ingredients- otherwise it is easy to end up with clumps of spices.

I used a good quality cognac and didn't think it was that great, nor did anyone else at Thanksgiving. It seemed less custardy than we like in a pumpkin pie and the liquor taste was strong. I'll stick to other recipes here next time.

Each Thanksgiving since 1992, my family has requested this pie. It's not too sweet and has a sophisticated, adult taste. We love it!

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving ever since it first appeared. It works with store-bought crust, too. True, as noted by another reviewer, it isn't the sweetest pumpkin pie, but that's what I like about it. The ginger whipped cream is absolutely yummy and adds sweetness.

This is a regular for thanksgiving since I first found it in Gourmet mag many years ago. The brandy flavor is excellent, the cream is fabulous, and I use fresh ginger that I grind up in a small food processor, and it adds a lovely texture and flavor. It's not too sweet which our family prefers. Works fine with a store bought crust in a pinch.

I used a store-bought crust for the sake of time and my sanity... The flavor here was fantastic- not too boozy (I used conagc). My only complaint is that it was a bit sloppy, runny. I would cut down on the milk, or make sure I used whole instead of 1% like I did. Otherwise, tasty stuff.

Not sweet enough, though brandy taste was good

The brandy makes this pie outstanding. I use fresh cooked pumpkin that I cook over medium heat to remove some of the moisture (be sure to cool completely).

I have baked this every Thanksgiving and Christman since 1992; it's my all time favorite pumpkin pie recipe.

I'm not really sure about this one . . . I did feel the cognac flavor was a little overwhelming. My husband loved it (especially the crust). I added 1/4 tsp. of sugar to the crust and pulsed the flour and butter/shortening in the food processor. I'm still on the search for the perfect pumpkin pie recipe . . .

I really enjoyed this pie but the reaction at Thanksgiving was mixed. One felt the cognac flavor was too strong. My nephew and my husband really enjoyed it. It was better than any store bought pie I've tasted.

I've been making this recipe every year since it appeared on the November cover of Gourmet in 1992. The brandy (I use cognac) really maes all the difference, giving the pie sophistication and an adult appeal. I've made a lot of pumpkin-pie converts with this recipe. Definitely a winner!

I've been making this pie since the recipe first appeared. Based on taste alone, I moght only have rated it three forks, but given the fact that the pie shell requires no prebaking and the filling can be assembled quickly in one bowl, I'm rating it four forks. My leaf-shaped cutter is smaller than the one specified, less than two inches, so I make six or seven pastry decorations. I've also used both bourbon and rum instead of the brandy. I served this for dessert at a luncheon today and was told by several people that it was the best pumpkin pie they'd ever tasted.

This was my first pumpkin pie. I used the ginger-pecan crust from another recipe and only made 1/4 of this crust just for the leaves (I didn't have the cookie cutter either). My sister made a pumpkin pie also but everyone whispered to me that mine was "incredible" in comparison. Even my husband who hates pumpkin pie hade a large piece after tasting a bite of mine.

I have made this recipe every year since 1992. My guests and I love it. It's the one thing I look forward to making each Thanksgiving. This year, however, I'm going to give up on the dentally decorated crust and do something simpler. Inevitably, one or two pieces of crust always break off.

I agree with the previous reviewer: go with the good Cognac you'll be glad you did. I've been making this every year since it first appeared and will make it for many more. It's simply delicious.

Just superb. Creamy, rich, smooth, with a much more complex flavor due to the Cognac (I used VSOP, what the heck). I'd never cooked a big holiday dinner before, but I made this dish (along with 3 other Epicurious recipes) for my very first Thanksgiving dinner, and everything --especially the pie-- was fantastic. Is it November yet? I'll definitely make this again!

I think this recipe is good, but the liquior was a little strong. If you are on the search for a pumpkin pie recipe besides the normal same ol' thing, I think this would be a good one to try out though :)

I really enjoyed this pumpkin pie. Best ever! I used dark rum instead of brandy and loved the result.

I don't do a lot of baking, but this recipe was easy to follow. The pies from the bakery sat there while this was was just devoured. It was fun to improvise the decorative leaves as I didn't have a leaf cookie cutter. I've been requested to make it again (and that very rarely happens).

I made this pie with fresh pumpkin and 1% milk instead of heavy cream, and it was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. You could really taste the brandy.

This recipe is so good and so easy it should be in everyone's permanent files. I substitute bourbon for the brandy in my version. Even my father-in-law, an admitted pumpkin-pie-hater, requests this pie from me every Thanksgiving.
