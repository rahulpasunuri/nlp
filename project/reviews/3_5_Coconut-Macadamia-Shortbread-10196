As far as shortbread goes this recipe is just average. Sure it's quick & I love the concept of macadamia & coconut but the shortbread itself does not have the right balance of salt & sugar. Would use another shortbread recipe with the same concept ingredients. Far better can be found.

Luscious! Used a larger springform pan so the dough was thin, cut into 16 pieces, then drizzled bittersweet chocolate on individual pieces. Very pretty, chocolate was nice contrast to the rich coconut-butter flavor of the shortbread. My book club loved these --

Great change from the every-day -- and so very easy, too. I used a bigger springform pan so the dough was very thin and delicate -- and cut in narrow slices, just the right amount of sweet. I did drizzle a bit of bittersweet chocolate too -- nice contrast to the crunch of the shortbread. These keep well --

These are delicious, melt in your mouth, wonderful cookies. They are so easy to make and a perfect treat with a cup of tea. I tried with and without coconut on top, thinking the coconut may make them too sweet, but it was delicous. I'll definetly be making them again, and adding the coconut on top!!

At the risk of writing one of those "I loved it! I changed everything!" reviews... I loved it! I used almonds instead of macadamias and added some small chocolate chunks, too. Used a little more butter than called for and baked in a sqaure pan -- made 12 cookies of perfectly reasonable size. Not a substitute for good old regular shortbread, but a yummy cookie for coconut lovers.

yum! The sweetness of the sugar and the salty macadamia nuts mixed very well together. I used extra fine granulated sugar istead of powdered and buttered the pan with salted butter since that was all I had softened, which added a little extra salty flavor to the bottom and sides. The coconut on top turned a beautiful golden color. The pan lasted about two hours in my house. Great and easy to make.
