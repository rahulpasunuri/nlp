I love this recipe as is. To make it more visually appealing for guests I serve it over a a bed of roasted cherry or grape tomatoes.

I too adapted this: substituted cashew nuts for bread crumbs and dill for readymade pesto. Superb.

I loved the cooking method of the fish. The tapenade was very good and I agree, not visually appealing. I will make this again and probably alter the tapenade based on ingredients I have available.

Very good and very easy. Restaurant quality results for little effort.

Made this dish for Valentine Dinner for my two favorite men....husband and son. Very good!! Substituted salmon for the sea bass and rounded out the meal with wild rice and green beans. They liked the tapenade so much the even put it on their bread. We'll do it again sometime.

This recipe was delicious! We had it twice in one week. We will definitely make it again. The flavor of the tapenade compliments the fish perfectly. Served it with kale and it was wonderful.

This was very good! I had all the stuff for pesto so I made my own instead of using store bought. I also served this on some spinach I wilted slightly with some Hoisin sauce. (I know it sounds funky, but it was really good.) I'll make it again.

We loved it! Simple, delicious. I used my own homemade basil/cilantro pesto in the recipe and put it on haddock instead of sea bass. The tapenade was great on crackers, too!

Great dish!

I thought the tapenade was excellent on its own with crackers/bread, but was just marginal on the fish.

This recipe was delicious and relatively easy, but was not visually appealing, so maybe not best for entertaining.

This recipe was amazing! I coudln't find sea bass, but made this with haddock and my husband and I loved it! Also, to fit with my husbands diet (no breadcrumbs), I processed almonds and used them instead. I will use this at least once a month!

This is great for dinner, either weekday or weekend. I tend to use a greater proportion of olives in the tapenade (it also makes a great spread for crackers)

This recipe was easy and delicious. We thought all the flavors worked very well together. Would definitely make it again.

This recipe is fantastic! I made it first for our family and everyone raved about it, so tonight I am making it again for a Valentine's dinner with friends from the mid-west who love good fish. I did not use the breadcrumbs but substituted an almond flour to minimize the carbohydrates. It is definitely a recipe to try if you like Mediterranean flavors. We do.

This is a great recipe to make for company. You can use dolphin filets instead, they are cheaper and easier to find!

We thought that it was delicious and easy to prepare. I substituted English Muffin crumbs for the bread and added some chopped walnuts to the tapenade. The leftover tapenade makes a great appetizer.

I found the the flavors very overpowering for the fish. We ended up scraping most of the topping off. It was a nice flavor but I felt it was better suited for a cracker topping than for fish. I did tried the braised Kale....and that was great!

I made this dish for my husband and I last weekend. It was absolute delicious. Turned out just like a restaurant meal. Took the suggestion to serve it with braised kale.....a very good accompanient
