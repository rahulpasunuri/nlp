I omitted the spinach, added 1 tsp sage and 1 tsp truffle oil. I substituted shitakes for morels and grated some fresh parm on top before firing into the oven. Delicious with grilled pacific cod!

Bleh! IF I were to make this dish again (and I won't), I wouldn't bother cooking the carrots beforehand. The additional cooking made them mushy. The flavors didn't go well together at all and were very muted. I was rather unimpressed with this dish.

Too much work and just ok. Needed salt and some things got a bit mushy - that may have been my fault. Not worth the effort.

I neglected to add that I followed the quantities of vegetables exactly, and found that I needed a 9x13 pan to bake it in, which is three quarts, NOT one quart as given in the recipe.

This was ok, just nothing special. I served it over buttered couscous for a substantial vegetarian meal.

Very colorful, but not worth the effort.

This was a lot of work and I am not sure it was much better than opening a bag of frozen mixed veges and making the saffron cream sauce.

Fresh morels are springing up here in Norther Minnesota and this was the perfect recipe for them! Rich, creamy, earthy and above all - so yummy!

We made this dish for a fellow subscriber of Bon Appetit and he loved it! Morels and saffron - mmmm!
