Loved this chowder. I didn't add the chiorzo because I don't eat red or white meat (but do eat seafood and fish). The chowder was still awesome. Oh, and used canned clams.

I make this chowder often. I add 2 cans of chopped clams and use fresh as well and I usually put in additional jalapenos or add crushed red pepper. I like it spicy. To the cook who dislikes cooking with clam juice - there are some bad ones out there. I use Snow's and have never had it ruin a dish.

My boyfriend went clamming so I tons of clams that I neededto do something with. And this was great! It was very tastey and easy to make. I would do this recipe again

I enjoyed this, but won't make it again. The clams added nothing to the recipe.

to the person who said you shouldn't alter the recipe by using canned or frozen clams because the picture shows fresh-- it also shows the chowder in a deep bowl, but the recipe says to put it in shallow bowls! what to do?! oh no!

Like other reviewers, I wasn't able to get fresh clams, so I used a can of Geisha baby clams with terrific results. Even my picky 11-year-old daughter loved it. I look forward to making it again with fresh clams.

Ihave not made this yet but it looks like it's right up my husband's and my alley. I am curious though, looking at the picture it clearly shows fresh clams still in their shell, yet some ratings state they used frozen or canned clams! I'm all for saving time but for some recipes you just should not substitute and this one looks like one of those.

I made this recipe as part of a mexican menu for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe to the tee except I used frozen clams instead of fresh. It was a big hit. I will definitely make it again when I have a big crowd. The chorizo gave it alot of flavor.

YUM! I love clam chowder and this recipe is a keeper. I used fresh and canned clams, but for a quick weekday dinner I think it would still be good with just the canned ones. OH and I left out the clam juice. I can't figure it out but whenever I buy bottled clam juice it's just awful. It ruins everything I put it in.

This was delicious. Didn't have the chorizo so I cut up a couple of Bruce Aidells jabanero sausages instead; which made it healthier since they are turkey/chicken sausages and used canned clams. It was so easy to make, already had the ingredients on had so didn't have to make a run to the grocery store. Just the right amount of heat after adding serrano chiles to it. Will definitely make again.

Great dish. Quick and simple yet complex flavors. We used it as a light meal on a busy day. We took the shortcut of using 10 oz. of canned baby clams instead of the fresh. It didn't look as elegant but eliminated the cleaning clams process.

This was absolutely delcious! I love traditional New England clam chowder, which is why I wanted to try this one containing the two things I really love about clam chowder--the clams and potatoes. Although the similarities end there, this one is definitely just as good as the New England version.

I'm always looking for a different receipe for clams, and this was very good. I substituted spicy turkey Italian sausage the for the Chorizo (although I'm sure the Chorizo would have been wonderful), and it was still delicious. A nice change of pace.
