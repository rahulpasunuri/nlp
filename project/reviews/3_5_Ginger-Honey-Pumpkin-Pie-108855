This is simply the best pumpkin pie recipe around. It is similar to every other "Libby" recipe HOWEVER, the fresh ginger and honey give it a wonderful "fresh" and refined flavor that EVERYONE who eats it loves! I have made it for at least 5 years and won't every go back to the boring regular pumpkin pie recipe. The crust is delicious too but it is very time consuming so if you have another pie crust recipe that you like you may try it. Well worth the time if you have it!!!

This pie has an unusual and delicious sweetness because of the honey. I used goat milk instead of cream and it came out wonderfully light. I highly recommend this recipe.

i made a version of this pie using this filling *plus a 1/4 tsp ground cardamon and cloves* and the crust from NYT vodka pumpkin pie recipe and it destroyed all other pies in a 100 mile radius. baked for a 1/2 hr at 350 and 1/2 hr at 300. cool for two hours.

This is an awesome recipe! The fresh ginger adds a nice kick and the pie is sweet but not too sweet. I also took the leap to forgo my grandmother's famous pie crust recipe in favor of trying this recipe as a whole and the crust was perfect. I cut a few corners and did the crust by hand instead of in the food processor (yes, I consider this cutting corners as I don't have a dishwasher...gasp) I used a pastry cutter and everything was totally great (better if you ask me, the little lumps left by the hand method ended in a great texture)I will make this my staple holiday pie recipe but don't roll over Grandma, my number one pie is still her good ole southern style pecan!

delicious pumpkin pie. i inverted the honey-brown sugar proportions to get more honey flavor, which was nice and not overwhelming at all. added cloves and nutmeg too. the fresh ginger is a nice touch. btw, it made too much filling for one pie crust for me so i had to have an overflow container to bake the rest.

I've made this recipe every thanksgiving and other special events since 2006, and never has someone not told me that it was the best pumpkin pie they ever had. I'm not sure why people would doctor (screw-up) the recipe and then rate it poorly - but if followed as written, it really is subtly flavored with the ginger and honey, and is delicious. I will always make this for my pumpkin pie recipe.

Delicious. Am a ginger lover so I added a lot, the honey flavor was also surprising noticeable.

Awful! In addition to the fresh ginger, added ground ginger and used mild honey; nevertheless the honey flavor was too pronounced. Also the texture was weirdly smooth, like invalid food.

This pie was absolutely amazing. I added a bit more ginger than the recipe called for, and added some fresh grated nutmeg. This gave the pie a delicious, pronounced spice. If you're a picky eater, or can't stand anything that deviates from tradition, then don't make this, but otherwise I find it a sophisticated variation of an old favorite. I'm not going back to regular pumpkin pie ever again.

This is a delicious recipe and a good variation on an old classic. Very popular among family and friends..

This is a pretty good pumpkin pie but the flavors didn't stand out very much. I prefer a more spiced and flavorful pumpkin pie. This turned out rather mellow. Husband liked it though.

The first pumpkin pie I'd ever made from scratch, and got me reviews such as "best pumpkin pie I've ever had" from long-time pumpkin pie afficionados.

My new favorite pumpkin pie recipe! The honey and cream create a wonderful creamy texture. It almost melts in your mouth!

Made this for Thanksgiving and hubby hated it--- said it tasted like pepper. It got lukewarm reviews from the other guests so I will skip this in the future. ESPECIALLY if there are kids. (although the honey whipped cream was to die for!)

This was an absolutely great pumpkin pie - from delicious filling to flaky crust. Everyone raved (including me, who generally doesn't even like pumpkin pie). The new standard for Thanksgiving.

I like ginger and this was nicely infused without overpowering the pumpkin. A definite keeper.

I love this pie. It gives the pumpkin a burst of flavor that only adds to the taste. I'll be making this recipe for years to come. It's a really terrific addition to a traditional Thanksgiving dinner.

This is my new favorite pumpkin pie recipe. It was so good I had leftovers for breakfast!! Par baking the crust made a big difference, giving it a crunch that was nice with the creamy pumpkin. I topped it with whipped cream sweetened with a bit of brown sugar and a dash of nutmeg. Yum!!

I've made this recipe two Thanksgivings in a row and have had rave reviews both times. It's relatively simple to make and has the most amazingly light texture and wonderfully complex but well blended flavors. Even the pickiest eaters (a pair of 16 month old infants) couldn't get enough of it!!!

The best pumpkin pie recipe I've ever made, and I've made quite a few! I used maple sugar instead of brown sugar and rice milk instead of cream in the pie (we had lactose-intolerant guests for Thanksgiving), and it came out wonderfully. The fresh ginger and honey add just the right depth of flavor. This is a keeper.

At first, I didn't know if this pie would be worth the effort to make again. The entire process took me something like four hours, so don't make this unless you have plenty of time. When I presented it to my husband, the first words out of his mouth were "Is it my mother's?" Thankfully it was not. We had his mothers on Thanksgiving Day and I will have to say that this one blew hers out of the water! My husband,(snicker, snicker) would have to agree!

Excellent pie filling! Without a doubt, the best I've had. But I did change a few things. I used a ginger snap crust and topped the pie with bourbon whipped cream. Additionally, instead of packed brown sugar, I used an equal amount of raw (demerrara) sugar. However, what I think really made the difference was the addition of an artisan honey. While I'm sure SueBee would work, a more complex honey will certainly add to the flavor. Everyone at my TDay dinner raved about the pie. And to think it was made at the last minute in lieu of a pumpkin cheesecake when I realized I had forgotten to buy cream cheese....

Finallly a pumpkin pie that stands out! I used unfiltered honey to avoid over-sweetening, and added a little nutmeg and extra ginger. I was afraid that the fresh pumpkin I used would be too watery, but it turned out great!

A fun and tasty twist on pumpkin pie. All of my dinner guests thought it was great, and requested that I make it for Thanksgiving.

I substituted finely chopped candied ginger for the fresh and squash for the pumkin. In the future I would probably increase the cinamon a bit. Overall quite a hit, even non pumkin pie fans said they liked it.

The filling was great! I added extra ginger and spices. Great texture. This will become my new standard pumpkin pie.

Everything about this pie was great-- the crust was tasty and easy, and the filling was subtly flavored. I was worried that it might be too gingery, but even my husband who isn't a ginger fan thought it was the best pumpkin pie he's ever had.

cook, p - boston, ma - loved this pie, delicious and nice smooth texture. Definitely would make again. Just want to know if there's a trick to not having the pie crack (have tried a water bath in pan in bottom of oven, but didn't work)??? Came out looking beautiful and as it cooled it ended up with a big cavern down the center - Help.

Splendid! I made three different pumpkin pies just for fun this Thanksgiving(classic, pumpkin streusel and this), and everyone voted this the best. Easy, and wonderful blend of flavors.
