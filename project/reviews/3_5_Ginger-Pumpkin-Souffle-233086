I always cook souffle roux in a double boiler. It is less finicky to cook and will not burn if you are not too attentive. I used a combination of ground ginger and 'fresh' ginger from a tube and it was excellent. Also added a small amount of Allspice. TRES BON RECIPE.

The warm souffle is very pretty but so airy, the flavors are muted in each bite. I added a touch of fresh nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves, which added a lot of flavor. I also used skim milk. The cold souffle the next day was delicious and creamy, and the flavors were much more developed. If you don't mind the appearance of a deflated souffle, serve it chilled and use the extra spices. It was a huge hit the next few days.These proportions yielded ten personal souffles.

I feel like I should have just eaten the pumpkin out of a can with some sugar instead of going through all of the egg/milk/ginger trouble. Good, but weird. Like hot pumpkin pudding.

Very easy recipe to follow. The soufflé came out to be very airy and the pumpkin flavor was there but it wasn't sweet enough for me. I felt like it was missing something. In the future I probably wouldn't make it again.

Exceptionally light and fluffy! I thought the balance of flavor was great. The eggs were so fluffy, they really need to be beaten thoroughly so that there is a stiff peak (it doesn't fall over). I didn't have enough ramekins so I used some other oven safe ceramic dishes and they worked well also!

Delicious, light, airy, and easy. I made the custard ahead so that I didn't need to do everything at the last minute, which made things less stressful. I also cut the recipe in half, and found that it filled 5 8-oz ramekins. Perhaps my egg whites were extra fluffy. It was a very good dairy-free winter dessert, although it won't fulfill any pie cravings - too light for that. But it's delicious in its own right.

This was so light and refreshing! Perfect after a heavy Thanksgiving meal. The pumpkin was lost in the ginger flavor. Next time, I would add more pumpkin, steep the ginger in the soy milk a little less, and add at least a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I also think I would dust the ramekins with crushed gingersnaps before filling them.

It's pleasant, but it doesn't stick with you. Enjoyable while it lasts, but inconsequential, forgettable even. Still, easy and nice.

I didn't rate the recipe b/c I made several changes and it irritates me when people do that and then rate it anyway. I halved the recipe. I used buttermilk instead of soy milk - it of course curdled when heated so I strained off the solids and ginger and added just enough cream to bring the amount of liquid back up to 3/4 cup. I also used a single large souffle dish, decreased the temp to 325F and cooked for about 40min. Delicious!!!! Don't be afraid to change a few things - it should still work great. Something I going to try next time is use more pumpkin but cook it on the stovetop first & reduce out some of the liquid which I think will increase the pumpkin flavor w/o turning the custard into soup.

Does anyone know if I might be able to use a large souffle dish in place of the smaller ones?

Very tasty and light. Added a sprinkle of "pumpkin pie spice" to the mixture, which turned out well. Next time I will add a tad more.
