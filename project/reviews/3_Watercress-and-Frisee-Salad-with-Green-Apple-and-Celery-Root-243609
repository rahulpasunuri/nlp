Please don't be put off by the one bad review. The fact that the alternative was a peanut butter sandwich should tell you something. This is a perfectly nice salad. Great texture, simple clean flavors as advertised. Easy to make, good way to get some celery root into your diet. Looks pretty.

Oh my gosh this was awful. The apples do nothing to balance the bitterness of the frisee and watercress. I had to throw it away and make a peanut butter sandwich for my husband.

Loved this. Great compliment to the juicy grilled steaks we ate.
