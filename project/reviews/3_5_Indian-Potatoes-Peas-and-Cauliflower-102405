I don't like to rate recipes if I don't make them as written, and I did some tweaking with this one. I increased the spices, added a jalapeno at the beginning, and fried the spices first. I also used sweet potatoes and increased the amount of peas. It was tasty and I especially liked it the next day - I made it into a kind of hash with poached eggs on top.

I doubled the tumeric, and the paprika and added 2 minced cloves of garlic. I read another review that said to put the spices in the oil and cook a few minutes to toast and bring out the flavor; I also cooked the cauliflower and potatoes a little longer. I had made butter chicken and had leftovers to eat with this - very, delicious and a pretty easy recipe. 1 skillet and lid, just chopping the ingredients, from start to finish about 1 hour!

I liked it a lot, but I also modified it. I did double turmeric, about double ginger, two cloves garlic pressed, a bit of curry powder, and some yellow onion too. I served it with basmati. I was pleased, but my boyfriend asked where the meat was.

This is a very simple recipe that tastes really good and was a nice addition to my Indian dinner party. I added the spices to the pan prior to adding the cauliflower - a few other reviews mentioned doing that to help the flavor. I did and thought the flavor was really good.

Used yams instead of russets for more flavor and nutrients. Doubled the ginger and eyeballed all the spices, adding some coriander and cumin. Pretty easy and rather tasty.

This makes 3 forks only with some changes. First, the seasonings need to be doubled at the very least. Garlic is a must (I used 3 cloves) and Cumin and Corriander need to be added. Oh, I also added some Cayenne. I eyeballed the amounts based on a large head of cauliflower and two medium potataoes. Almost two cups of water were needed to prevent the vegetables from drying out and sticking to the pan. Salt to taste, the amount in the recipe won't be enough even doubled. With these changes, this is a four fork do-over.

Like many others said, the dish was too bland. The idea is a good one, though. I, like others, heightened the flavor by using more ginger, 5 cloves garlic, 1/2 yellow onion, 2 tsp. curry powder, 1 tsp. chili powder, 2 tsp. red pepper flakes (for the spiceaholics). I also used chicken/vegetable broth in place of the water. The cauliflower took a good while to cook - I recommend steaming it for 5 min or so before adding to the rest.

I am so glad I made this recipe - but very glad that I read other people's reviews. I sauteed garlic with the ginger and also added the spices right after the ginger/garlic. In addition, I added some onion with the potatoes and then chick peas at the end. *Note* I had to add a bit of liquid at the beginning so the spices didn't stick. Total cooking time was about 20-30 min - I kept it on low as I was waiting for other parts of dinner to be ready.

This is too bland (even my spice-adverse child said so!). I added garlic, onion, and coriander as well as increasing the amount of spices listed in the recipe.

Rating: 2
If all the spices are added before the cauliflower, the flavor is totally different. They get watered down if added after with the cauliflower.

I used half a teaspoon of curry and only a dash of tumeric. I used chicken broth and, when I added the broth, I also added maybe a quarter cup or so of cream. I sauteed the potatos with onions for closer to 10 minutes, despite having cut them 'matchstick size.' All told though, it came out great. It's a flavorful but mild dish. Even my friends who hate cauliflower loved it.

I've had this recipe at many Indian restaurants. I believe it is authentic because an Indian friend who introduced me to her country's cooking told me it was. Having trouble with getting the vegetables done? Just cook longer! The recipe states to cook until tender, about 5 minutes. If your's need longer than five minutes to reach the tender stage, just cook them longer. Not all Indian recipes are curries. This one isn't and I find it delicious.

Rating: 3
Used curry powder instead of turmeric and the dish turned out great! Paired it with a garam masala tikki chicken and rice for a very authentic looking and tasting Indian meal. After reading the reviews, I extended the cooking time so the potatoes ended up a bit soft. But because the entree had a creamy sauce, it worked out wonderfully!

Not bad, but I would make more of a curry flavor rather than the tumeric, chili powder and paprika seasoning. This seems to need some freshly ground coriander as well. I added some onion. Also, I have some chipotle sauce that I made from this site, and tossing just a little bit of this with the cauliflower gives it an added depth of smokiness and warmth. It's a good beginning, but needs a bit more flavor.

I Love this recipe!!! So does everyone that I have made it for. As with the other reviews, you do need to cook the potatoes a bit longer if you want them to brown. The flavors are perfect for me and the only change I make to this recipe is to use a whole bag of peas instead of 1/2 cup.

Rating: 3
I sliced the potatoes small enough (a little larger than matchstick) but they took longer than 3 minutes and they didn't brown like I thought. (Probably a non-stick pan would be the solution.) Regardless, this dish was easy to make and devoured by our dinner guests. One of them even took home the last of the leftovers. THAT's a good dish!

Potatoes require more than 5 minutes to brown but it is worth the wait. I prefer brocolli to cauliflower so I substituted without any problem. I also added in a bit of half and half to the final dish and let it reduce to make a creamy and flavorful sauce.

I didn't have turmeric or chili powder so I used garam masala instead. I left out the potatoes and added onion and more peas. Substituted vegetable broth for water. An easy and tasty weeknight sidedish.

I didn't have turmeric or chili powder so I used some fresh curry powder and cardomom. I used chicken stock instead of water and did simmer it longer than five minutes. I just retuirned from a trip to India and it does tast authentic

I was never a fan of Indian food, curry in particular. But this dish was so tasty! It was very easy to make, although I did leave out the ginger (i don't like it). I used a bit more water than 1/2 a cup, and cooked it longer as the potatoes were nowhere near done after 5 minutes. I really loved this dish and can't wait to have the leftovers! Will definitely keep this recipe handy and make it again and again!

Like other reviewers, I wasn't blown away by the flavors of this dish. And I think that's why I liked it so much. Normally I love spicy, boldly flavored food, which this is not. But it was very soothing. The flavors all blended together extremely well. If you want flash, look elsewhere, but if you want a pleasant meal, this is it!

The recipe was easy enough. The potatoes, peas and cauliflower all cooked well. I did cook the potatoes for and extra 5 minutes. The big disappointment was in the taste. There just wasn't any. Very bland.

The whole family loved this. Definately cook the potatoes until they brown, which will take mor than three minutes. Very good with warm Indian wheat bread.

We barely touched this. The combination of spices was not very palatable. Something was missing. The potatoes were the only thing we ate, and only after we fried them longer, as suggested by other reviewers. I'm taking this out of my recipe box!

This ingredient list was very good as written. I followed the suggestions to fry the potatoes longer and am glad I did. I even enjoyed it cold the next day.

I made this as an accompaniment to Fragrant Beef Curry with Rice, also on this site, and left out the rice and used this, which was a nice change. I used the same amount of ginger for only two persons, and it tasted really fresh (we like ginger very much). Make sure you saute the potatoes long enough so that they become crunchy.

Made this dish with one change, no peas. Next time I would add a few chopped sauteed onions. A very simple, but tasty dish.

don't be shy with the ginger as well as the other spices listed. Threw in some garlic to give some more zip to this tumeric themed "Indian" dish.

This was very good. I also cooked it longer then recommended. I was very pleased with the mild yet full flavor of the spices. I will make it again.

An easy dish that can be eaten on its own or as a side dish with just about anything.

I cook this dish longer than recommended because I too find the potatoes nowhere near done otherwise. I have made it numerous times to rave reviews. My Dad, who normally does not eat Indian food was quite thrilled and had multiple helpings.

Made it, ate it, liked it! Easy and goes a long way to the area of something different. We live in a World that has grown small, summer veggies in the winter, strawberries all year round. We can now enjoy the world by enjoying it's food.

This is very easy to make, and has a wonderful flavor. I personally prefer my "Indian" food spiceier, so next time I'll double up on the spices. Overall good dish

Tasty, not too tricky and not too spicy if your eaters aren't too accustomed to strong Indian foods.

I thought this dish was very flavorful. I did make some adjustments. I browned the potatoes for 9 minutes. They were nowhere near being ready at 3 minutes. I used a combination of broccoli and cauliflower, since I needed to use up leftovers from a party. I doubled the ginger since I really like it and I chopped too much. And I used vegetable broth instead of water.

My husband & I really liked this recipe. It is a pleasant twist to a typical vegie side dish and very easy to prepare. It was very flavorful, and if cooked correctly, not at all mushy. I followed the directions and browned the potatoes for a nice dark color. This side dish is spicy so I suggest serving it with a somewhat bland entree. The entree I chose was too strong and the flavors competed.

Rating: 3
This dish combines great flavor with beautiful color. It offers an easy way to turn the "same old vegetables" into something more tasty and interesting. (Even my vegetable-averse husband requests this dish.) I noticed in the other reviews that some were having problems with undercooked potatoes -- just saute the potatoes until they are lightly browned (it may take more than three minutes) and you should have no problems. I also let the vegetables steam (covered in the pan) for a few minutes before serving.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Relatively easy to make. Following the advice of those here, I microwaved the cubed potatoes for about 10 minutes before adding them to the pan. Left out the cauliflower and added more peas. Will add more spice next time.

I made this dish for company (along with a chicken curry) and it was a great success. To insure the potatoes would be cooked through, I precooked them for a couple minutes in the microwave. My husband doesn't like cauliflower or peas, but he loved it.

Rating: 3
We just loved this dish. No problem with the veggies being undercooked, but I did add almost a cup of water (b/c I had a lot of cauliflower) and I let it steam longer than called for (simply by accident, while making other parts of the meal). My husband and I love Indian food and we were both very pleased to find a palatable way to eat cauliflower. His only request: next time, increase the proportion of potatoes to cauliflower. Now, if anyone out there has a good recipe for the Indian dish that combines pureed spinach with potatoes, that is next on my list of recipes to conquer!!

I had the same experience with under-cooked vegetables. Also, maybe I'm too Americanized, but this needed some type of curry or cream based sauce, plus, more spice - too bland!

Rating: 3
I followed the instructions as far as sauteing the potatoes, cauliflower, etc. At the conclusion, the potatoes and cauliflower were still raw. We ended up microwaving the dish for 15 minutes before the potatoes and cauliflower were cooked through. In the future, I would either 1) partially precook the potatoes and cauliflower prior to pan frying, or 2) microwave at the conclusion of pan frying as we did.
