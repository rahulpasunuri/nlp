Delicious! Was devoured and everyone wanted more. Very easy to prepare. To the nitpicker who objected to the name of the recipe either call it something else of simply substitute Creole seasoning for the seasonings liste. Duh!

Truly yummy! I actually didn't have fresh crab meat so I used 4 cans of crab meat instead. The only other thing I changed was the bread coating... I used crushed up plain nacho chips. These burgers are a new favourite.... super filling though. I think I might make them a bit smaller next time.

These are thoroughly magnificent. Casual but elegant. Serve w/sweet potato fries and orange/honey sorbet for dessert.

Whether you consider this creole or not, it makes for some tasty crab burgers. I used some store bought 'cajun' seasoning mix to help things along

Great recipe. I've been making crab cakes like this for years. I don't use as much breading, however. If you use Panko, refrigerate before dipping in crumbs. They will hold together better. I use regular bread crumbs for it and it works fine. For 1 lb. crab meat, I use probably 1/2 to 3/4 cup bread crumbs. To those who abuse this site with their smart alecky remarks, get serious about cooking or become a stand-up comedy act.

What makes this recipe Creole? 1/2 teaspoon Cayenne? Mon Dieu!

This recipe was boring, boring, boring. There are better recipes on this site than this one.

This is a good recipe, but with a few modifications, your guests will be lining up to get your new recipe. Instead of adding crab to the mixture, substitute ground beef. Omit the bread crumbs. Use ketchup instead of tarter sauce and serve with a pickle. I have been making this crab burger recipe for years and continue to get rave reviews. A real crowd pleaser for seafood lover's of all ages.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Following the suggestions of others, I added the crab last. The only change I made was to use panko crumbs on the outside. I had a slight problem with them falling apart while they fried, perhaps chilling them for 15-30 minutes would help. Very nice blend of flavors.

I found this delicious, using imitation crabmeat because I could not afford the real thing. It was great, and extremely easy. I agree that you should mix the crab in last. I followed the recipe and did not find it too bready.

a hint...add the crab meat last and gently toss. use only 1/2 the stated amount of bread crumbs. This way the crab won't break up if stirred in with the other ingredients and won't be bready.
