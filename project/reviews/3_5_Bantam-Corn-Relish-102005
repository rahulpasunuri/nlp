We served this along side the beer braised brisket at a dinner club and it was well received. We served it both hot and cold but most preferred the hot version. It is a little sour but would work well against a sweet meat dish. It is very easy and makes enough for 12-18 servings.

This is a fabulous relish that is great with burgers on the grill. Very tangy and a nice texture.
