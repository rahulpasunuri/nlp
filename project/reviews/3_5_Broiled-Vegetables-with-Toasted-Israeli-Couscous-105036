This was so good. At first glance I thought those were tomatoes in the picture, and that sounded better than red peppers to me, so I substituted by broiling some thick-sliced romas. Like others, I had too much couscous water, would use more like 1 1/4 cups broth next time. Did not serve at room temp, kept everything warm and mixed (lightly) into hot couscous at the end.

I made this for a dinner party to accompany salmon and it was wonderful. Everyone liked it and I could have eaten a full meal of just this dish. It will definitely become a staple of our kitchen.

I made a versions of this recipe where I ROASTED the vegetables (seasonal ones - peppers, sweet potatoes, eggplant) and mixed them with the couscous to serve as a vegetarian/vegan dish at a dinner party. It was a huge hit and I would definitely make it again. Tasted great hot and at room temperature.

Doubled the amount of couscous, using half water, half chicken stock. Roasted a number of vegetables from the garden, including tomatoes, zucchini, onions, peppers. Did not mix the veggies with couscous, simply put on top and then served with sausage for a complete meal.

We thought this was great. Really easy to pull together and we loved the flavor. I didn't have a problem with extra liquid--in fact, mine was almost dry when I took the lid off the pot.

I suggest everyone try Bobby Flay's recipe posted on foodtv.com (Toasted Israeli Couscous Salad with Grilled Summer Vegetables).

Very good, but make sure to serve immediately or it gets soggy

I agree with the other reviewer, the couscous was too soupy. I think there may be a mistake in the amount of water/stock required to cook the couscous. To reduce the soupy texture I made the following revisions: cooked more couscous with less stock to reduce the soupy texture, added more veggies. The added "drier" couscous saved the dish but it still wasn't ideal. Net, net, great dish but recipe needs work.

I had to come up with a vegan dish and had some leftover Israeli couscous, and came across this recipe. I was surprised at how tasty it was! I chunked up a red pepper, red onion , yellow squash, and zucchini, marinated them in just a small amount of oil and vinegar, and broiled them for only about 10 minutes - the colors and textures were fine even though it waited several hours before being served. I also added some feta cheese for the non-vegans, which gave it a real bite. I'm having the leftovers for lunch today - a very tasty and healthful alternative to heavy sandwiches!

The presentation left a little to be desired -- soupy and gray. But the flavors were great. I'm not crazy about Israeli coucous -- not worth the cost or the trouble to find it. I think couscous or orzo would be adequate substitutes.

The broiling was a little tedious as described. Can put into a shallow pan and broil, turning veggies every few minutes. It is the taste you want, and the browned edges on some of the veggies.

Excellent dish -- I added more vegetables than suggested. I made it as a side dish this time, but I can easily see adapting it and making it a main dish. Everyone loved it.

This recipe is extremely similar to one in Bobby Flay's cookbook. His adds dijon mustard to the vinaigrette, and it is wonderful. His recipe is a huge hit whenever I serve it, especially at barbecues. Check it out on foodtv.com

Yummm! This is a basic recipe easily adapted. I brought home local summer squash, peppers, and a small eggplant from the farmer's market and went to work. I doubled (at least) the vegetables and couscous, added a pound of tofu in 1-inch cubes, tripled the marinade, roasted the vegies and tofu in the oven since my broiler is tiny, and it made a delicious and filling dinner for 4 adults and 4 sometimes-picky kids.

See if you can find the Israeli couscous, it really does make a difference! I usually use an assortment of squashes and grill them, mix everything and chilled the salad. I've also mixed in chunks of cooked chicken amd served over mixed greens as an entree salad.

I loved this recipe! I used regular cous-cous and tons more veggies and serve it along side broiled fish. I would certainly reccommend this.
