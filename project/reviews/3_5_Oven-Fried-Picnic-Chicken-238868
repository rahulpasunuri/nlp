Great recipe! I took other cooks' advice and drained the chicken for a while. Also upped the dried herbs and used panko breadcrumbs. The chicken was a big hit at a potluck picnic.

Was delicious...make sure you drain chicken well before dredging in crumbs. I used a wire cooling rack over a cookie sheet to drain for several minutes. I also tried with Panko breadcrumbs and a mixture a fresh minced herbs, and loved it even more!!!

This was soooo easy and was great to do ahead and take to a picnic. I love the fact that it wasn't fried. I made it using all drum sticks so the little ones could easily manage.

A big hit. I added some brown sugar and kosher salt to the buttermilk to amke it more of a "brine". My husband said it was awesome for not being fried.

A good solid recipe and easy. I doubled the herb amounts for the dry mixture.

Seemed to go over well at school picnic. I'd make it again. Even with storing it between paper bags, some of the pieces had the coating get soggy. I think I'd let them cool a bit more before putting in fridge next time; there was alot of condensation in the container when I brought them out of the fridge which may have contributed to the coating getting soggy. I used half corn flake crumbs & half bread crumbs which gave a bit more texture to the coating and added about 50% more of the spices than specified. Next time, I will NOT add the garlic. It was a bit too garlicky to me.

I've made this several times, increasing the oven temp for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the outside. I found that draining the pieces on a cookie rack is important, as well as using unopened brown paper lunchbags between layers when storing.

I've made this recipe at least half a dozen times and it's always superb! Crispy outside, juicy inside. Delicious!

Made this for a 4th of July picnic and it turned out really great. It was great served hot or cold.

Made this for an afternoon potluck where it would be served cold. Very well received! Easy to make - baked for 45 minutes turning carefully, once after 30 minutes.

Easy to make. Bland. Soggy crust. Cooked drumsticks 45 minutes.

The chicken was easy to make but the crust was soggy and not full of flavor.

Delicious and easy. I cooked it about an hour and it was perfect. If using breast, the 35-45 minutes would likely have been fine.
