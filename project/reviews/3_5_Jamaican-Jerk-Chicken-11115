This recipe is nothing short of astounding! On short notice I found myself hosting Christmas dinner (my friends' cat died and they couldn't deal with entertaining...) so I decided to cook kwanzaa food and found this recipe on epicurious and served it to the general ravishment of all. I'll make it many times in the future. I served it with the accompanying epicurious recipes for collard greens, sweet potato souffle and peach cobbler and "The Joy of Cooking" hominy casserole. The guests went through this stuff like a swarm of locusts. One guest from the South raved about the authenticity of the finished products. Big thumbs up!

This dish alway gets rave reviews when I make it!

I'm not really supposed to rate this because I left out the vinegar and ginger (the latter was an accident). But it was GREAT. Marinated for 24 hours, so the chicken was very tender and with balanced sour/sweet, spicy/perfumy results. Simply baked in oven 375-400 degrees until skin was brown and crispy. Chicken didn't dry out. We ate it with collards and sweet potato puree.

I love Al Roker's Jerk Chicken recipe, but I believe this may be better. I made one third of the marinade for 2 large breasts and 4 small thighs. I substituted half a jalapeno with seeds for the Scotch bonnet and accidentally omitted the lime juice. The result was fantastic. The spice blend and degree of heat are perfect for my taste. I marinaded the chicken only a couple of hours, yet the fabulous taste permeated the chicken. This is definite keeper.

I love jerk chicken but this version I found to be too heavy on the lime flavor. I used fresh lime juice and marinated it for 6 hours. I followed this recipe precisely except I used jalapeno pepper. It was OK, just not great. I served it with red rice and fresh mango on the side. I wish I could find the other jerk recipe I used to use. I think it had soy sauce (!) in it.

My husband and I did not like this version of jerk chicken at all. I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't very spicy at all, and was generally kind of boring. With so many spices, the result almost came across as perfume-y smelling. I love jerk chicken, but will definitely will not make this recipe again.

Made this dish for dinner tonight. Based on previous reviews we halfed the cinnamon and used 4 habenero peppers. Whoa Baby!!! This was really good and HOT HOT HOT!!! We loved it, but with 4 peppers, it wasn't for the meek (we are still buzzing with endorphins) ...perhaps next time we'll stick to 2 peppers!!!!

I loved this recipe. I made it for company with skinless chicken breast skewed on kabobs. It grilled beautifully. I also made the chicken breast in the oven. I served it with a fresh peach chutney recipe I found in Bon Appetit.

Although I am pregnant and could not indulge in this dish, my husband loved it. He was impressed I made the sauce from scratch. I will definately make this dish again, even if I can eat it. As my husband really loved it.

I made this for my family of 6 and NO ONE liked it. I was hesitant at first to try it and I'm sure I followed the recipe to the tee, but I was very disppointed. First off, the maranaide looked like runny cat food and the cinnamon was over-powering. It'll be a while before I try the other Jerk Chicken recipe. Maybe I dont have the taste of the Islands!!

After reading all the wonderful reviews, I was sure this would be a winner. It was okay, and smelled wonderful, but too much lime (and possibly too little marinating time - 2 hours) combined with boneless skinless chicken breasts made the difference. It was tasty, but nothing special. I think I'll try the other Jerk Chicken recipe on this site before making this one again.

I loved this recipe! It was just what I was looking for. The sauce is DIVINE.

This was pretty good, and I will make it again; however, I will make some changes. I used 4 peppers and felt it could use more. For our taste it was heavy on cinnamon so will decrease it dramatically. In fact at times it smelled like cinnamon rolls were baking.

This recipe uses high doses of the spices making the meat intensely flavorful and the whole house smell wonderful...a real treat for arriving guests. I would recommend a few variations. I prefer a bit more hot chilis. You can spice this up a bit without endangering the quality of the dish. I much prefer using dark brown sugar, instead of white, and more of it.

I made this for a group of 7 after returning from the Caribbean for my honeymoon. I wanted to make an authentic Caribbean dish and it was a huge hit! I made it in the oven and broiled it for a few minutes at the end to make the skin crispy. I also doubled the recipe and felt it had a bit too much lime flavor. The flavor of the marinade is really unique and I will definitely make this again.

I used this sauce to make jerk wings on the grill. A huge hit - served with Red Stripe beer, of course. THE SAUCE IS WONDERFUL!
