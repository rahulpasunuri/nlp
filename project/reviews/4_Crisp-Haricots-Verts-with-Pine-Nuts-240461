I felt that there was way too much butter and a waste of good pine nuts. The pine nuts just slid to the bottom of the bowl from all the butter on the beans. Next time I make this, I will cut way down on the amount of butter so that it just lightly coats the beans.

Great, easy recipe. When I make it next week for Thanksgiving I plan to mince some shallot to gently flavor the browned butter. This is such a smart alternative to the traditional, too caloric, green bean casserole. And pretty!

Could use some garlic & a little extra salt.

I really like this simple recipe. I didn't get as much brown butter flavor as I would have liked, but I may not have "browned" it enough...multitasking!

This was a very rich-tasting recipe, with the pine nuts and the butter, but I don't think you need quite as much butter as the recipe calls for. I did use the oregano and thought the full package was very good.

This is one of my favorite ways to do green beans! I add some garlic once the pine nuts start browning, and then once the green beans are in, I add a little lemon juice and zest. I love it every time.

Tis is a great recepe. I added Garlic to the butter and uses pine nuts once and almonds once. Great positive feedback on both. I toasted the almonds alone and put them on tome after cooking the beans, delicious!

This is fantastic! Made it once with the oregano and once without and I agree its not a must. The brown butter really bring out the bean flavor. And not a ton of prep. Will definitely make again.

These were very good! Possibly if I had been able to find actual haricot verts the dish would have been even better, but the thin green beans seemed to work quite well. And my SO, who usually can take or leave pine nuts, liked them in this a lot! The browned butter tasted delicious and the oregano added a little extra oomph. But I found myself eating the green beans and pine nuts separately more than together; I guess I just wish they had blended a little more somehow. I think I might try cutting the green beans into smaller pieces next time instead of just trimming them. But I will definitely be making these again -- so easy, good for a crowd, and really very tasty!

My New Year's guests were positively gushing over these beans. Boring old pine nuts are spectacular cooked like this, with almost a salty type taste. The whole dish is very lively and bold for being so simple. I couldn't taste the oregano the first time I made it and left it out last night. It wasn't missed at all.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving - many people went back for seconds and even thirds. I found actual cooking times to be a bit longer than the recipe calls for, though.

Yummy side dish for Thanksgiving---I was never a fan of pine nuts, but toasted in butter is a different story! Added a great flavor to the haricots verts. I left out the oregano. Will definitely make again!

I'm not a green bean fan .... but oh dear. These I just love love love. So rich and yummy. The idea of lemon zest does sound good too. Highly recommend. And the best are the Haricots Vert from Costco. Always fresh and crisp

This was the favorite of our Christmas side dishes. The pine nuts give it a delicious nutty flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I love haricot verts and order them whenever possible. The pine nuts in brown butter give the beans such a rich nutty flavor and the green beans stay crispy. This was better than the ones I had in France, and the recipe is so easy!

There were excellent for Thanksgiving dinner. They received rave reviews from my non-green eater guests. Extremely easy to make for special occasions because Haricot Verts are pricey but well worth the extra $$$.

A lovely rich side dish. I added a pinch of sugar as my butter for some reason wasn't browning the way it should have. Delightful!

This recipe was perfect. I ate almost all of the haricots verts myself in one sitting!
