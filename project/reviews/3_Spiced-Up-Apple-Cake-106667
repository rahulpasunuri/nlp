This recipe fell short for me. It lacked the rich spicy flavor that the ingredients (and smell while baking) promised.

As other reviewers have said, this cake is moist and flavorful. Our guests liked it very much. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1/2 cup yoghurt, and I liked the creamy taste it added.

The cake was moist. Our guests thought it was a hit. It would be a great addition to a bruch.

This cake is has a wonderful texture and flavor, and is very easy to make. The Calvados syrup adds moisture and helps the flavors blend beautifully, but does not give a liquor taste. The cake got rave reviews from everyone. I increased the raisins and nuts to 1 cup each.

Didn't taste too apply, and was generally bland. I'll stick with apple crisp.
