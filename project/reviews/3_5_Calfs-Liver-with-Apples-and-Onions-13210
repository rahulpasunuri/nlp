We loved it as much as we were going to love any liver recipe. The apple, bacon, onions and lemon were all delicious and helped mask the liver taste and texture. Next time we are going to cut the liver into smaller pieces and use about twice as many apples, onions, and bacon.

Terrible. Awful. Vile. Disgusting. I am never, EVER eating ANY variation of liver and onions ever again!

Yummy. Not sure about healthy. But yummy. Beef liver works fine too if I soak it in milk for a few hours to take the edge off the flavor.

Very easy and very tasty...the apples put a great twist on the traditional liver and onions recipe.

Excellent! Made it several times; always a hit.

My husband and I grew up in homes where liver was like roof shingles. Now this is one of our favorite meals. We eat a low-carbohydrate diet, so I reduce the apples to 1 and cut the pieces up smaller.

I love the combination with the apples. It is very common where I come from!

This was a really delicious alternative to boring liver and was lovely and moist and even my kids liked it! We had it with creamy garlic potatoes.
