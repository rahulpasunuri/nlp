great recipe as is, but if you want to kick it a bit put the sauce in a pan on the grill close the lid and let it smoke for a few minutes, talk about impressing your friends, heck they might not even leave.

As un-authentic as this is, it's very very good. We had it with the corn tortillas and cold mexican beers I made this the once two summers ago and lost the recipe. So glad to find it again and will be making it soon. Perhaps I'll try rubbing the fish with my chili powder (ancho, pasilla, guajilla, habanero and sweet paprika)

There's no need to strain the salsa. To make this dish more authentic and much tastier, fry the salsa in a little oil after blending. Now you have a more traditional salsa roja. I ate it with lots of lime, avocado and fresh corn tortillas, and drank it with cold Corona. Really brought me back to being in Mexico.

I will definately make the sauce again and as previous reviewers suggested strain it to make a delicious salsa. I made this dish for my boyfriend (aka lab-rat) and loved it. I used swordfish and the sauce was a perfect compliment.

It was a lovely dish.

This recipe was easy to make and was very delicious. I found the sauce to be a bit watery so I passed it through a colander before serving it, which gave it the consistency of a chunky salsa. I served it with white rice on the side, and since the fish turned out so flaky, we mixed the rice, sauce and fish together on our plates. Yummy! Overall, easy to make, lots of flavour... a great summer dish.

This was fantastic. A beautiful dish served to guests who raved and went home with copies of the recipe. Fortunately, I made it before the last two reviews or I might not have made it and would have missed out on something special (I believe those reviews are based on authenticity, not taste). And as for taste, this is almost a four fork. Will definitely make again -- often.

the cook form mexico city is absolutely right, it doesn't even come close to the original, but that has to be eaten out on a sandy beach under a straw roof with a million flies and moskitos around your legs... but it's worth it.

Come on, Gentle people! Stop trashing recipies. If you are giving a recipe, try to be as close as possible to reality. This recipe is so far from a "pescado sarandeado" that you should call it differently. The fish, open as indicated, should be marinated in a paste made out of different chiles and spices and then grilled. I do not have the recipe but I have the taste in my mind. This is not it.

Excellent ! Elegantly simple. If your palatte is tender, reduce the amount of chilis. The first time we served this fish there wasn't even whiff of the fragrance left!
