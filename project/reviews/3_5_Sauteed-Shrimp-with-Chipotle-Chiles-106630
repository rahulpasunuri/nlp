I was really disappointed by this dish. It seems to be missing something. I did use the marinade and even added more chipotles, but still it was just fair.

This dish is delicious and ridiculously simple, perfect for a weeknight or for entertaining. Like everyone else, I skipped the marinade.

I too skipped the marinade, just added some lime juice to the chipotle mixture and let it sit for 15 minutes or so. came out terrific! will definitely make again, so fast and easy and yummy.

Like others - I skipped the marinade and let the shrimp sit in the sauce for 15 to 20 minutes. Works well with chicken: The dinner party doubled in size at the last minute so I doubled the recipe and added skinless chicken breasts that I cubed and prepared in a seperate bowl - both were superb!

P.S. I have decided the marinade is not needed--have done it with & without. Can't tell the difference.

I LOVE this recipe! It should have a 5th fork for ease. It's always a hit. It's so easy, I feel almost guilty serving it to company. I read one review that added allot of hot things to it. Not sure what they are doing, but I sure hope no one follows their advice. It would blow your head off. Perhaps that was their idea. If it's not hot enough, add more chipotle, red flakes, whatever to your taste. In this case, it's not the heat so much as the flavor of the chipotle.

skipped the marinade but added some lime juice, plus double the garlic and double the chipotles. marinated for twenty minutes in that then sauteed, to excellent results. could cut down on the olive oil in the saute next time, but otherwise everything was divine!

One of the best recipes ever. I will make it over and over again. I did marinate the shrimp which gave them a wonderful citrus note. It is absolutely perfect for company as a few minutes of saute are all that is required. I served with a timbale of white rice and garnished with cilantro. Amazing!

I too skipped the marinade & just let the shrimp sit for a while in the chipotle mixture. Served them on the Spinach with pear and avacado salad from this site...yum!

to make this recipe go from so-so to HOT AND TASTY adapt as follows... add a VERY generous splash of tequila to the marinade and a just as generous handful of hot pepper flakes. also be sure to use the hottest hot pepper sauce you have in the house.... when adding the chipotle chilis add about 2-3 tablespoons instead of one. IF YOU LOVE SPICY FOOD YOU MUST TRY THIS. DELICIOUS!!!

Very easy to prepare and had great flavor. Made the recipe for the first time at a dinner party and everyone loved it.

My boyfriend loves spicy foods and sure enough, he loved this! I added some red pepper flakes to the marinade (which we couldn't really taste) and it was great!

Delicious!!!

I agree with the cook who said it wasn't saucy enough and also agree with the cook who couldn't tell the difference with or without the marinade. If I made it again, I'd skip the marinade and just add lime to the sauce.

This is absolutely fantastic!!!! It is definitely going on our "favorite list"!

This was wonderful! I served it with tortillas, refried beans and the Pineapple-Avocado Salsa that I found on this site. The flavor combination was wonderful!

I didn't use the marinade, but let the shrimp sit in the chipotle sauce for about an hour. And as I only had dried chipotle chiles, I hydrated them and added a little tomato paste. Spicy and good. Thank you Zarela!

I think this has potential to be a very good recipe. When I made it, at the end of sauteing the shrimp, I added the juice of one lime. I then served it over cheesy grits. In the future, I plan to add tomato sauce to the sauce to make it a bit more saucy--if you just double this recipe you end up with tons of sauce that is way too hot to actually eat as a sauce. I think it does have potential though.

I have made this with the marinade & without. Can't see any need for it. I did let the shrimp sit in the chipotle mix for a good hour in the fridge. It is so easy & good! recipe demanded by all.

Wow, deelish! I omitted the marinade, the sauce itself is all the shrimp needs. I will also double the sauce next time, it's so good. What a quick and easy and tasty dish for a weeknight, but definitely splashy enough for special occasion or company. A keeper for sure!

Smoky, spicy, lots of flavor. I only had access to frozen cooked small shrimp--not a great start, but it still worked out fine. I think the marinade does add something, certainly the hot sauce I used was noticeable, so I'm not sure I would skip it. Three forks instead of four just because the strong flavor is really a bit much. I had it with fresh tortillas and rice, but maybe it would be better in combination with more dishes.

I made this with chicken breast,and added green olives and raisens...I'm just crazy like that!

I doubled the chipotles and served over white rice. Mmmm! I used the marinade, but next time will not, the sauce was so good I couldnt tell if the marinade did anything at all. Will try again soon as soft tacos. This is a keeper ;-)

A keeper. Didn't have time to let the marinade sit for an hour, so I threw the shrimp in directly after making it. Let it sit for about 30 minutes total. Tortiallas, avocado, shredded monterey jack, sour cream on the table. Side dish of rice cooked with diced pepper, diced carrot, tomato & drained can of beans (all in the rice cooker)

I didn't use the seafood marinade. In addition, I didn't bother putting the ingredients in the blender - I just sauteed everything. I added some chopped up green pepper and onion at the end and served it as soft tacos (with shredded cheese, sour cream, tomatoes and jalapenos on the side). It was a nice weekday meal.

on the advice of the reviewer from berkeley, we skipped the marinade and just used the chipotle sauce. great flavor! fast and easy too. however we thought it needed something cool/fresh to complement it; next time we will try adding some chopped cilantro and lime juice and maybe some shredded cabbage for shrimp tacos.

This really was delish. I'm going to try it again with boneless chicken (can't always afford shrimp) for a weekday meal.

Very good shrimp dish. We increased the garlic and chipotle to suit our tastes. We sauteed some yellow peppers and onion and piled it all into fresh flour tortillas with a sprinkling of fresh lime juice. I think you can skip the marinade -- the chipotle sauce gives it so much flavour that we couldn't really tell if the marinade had any effect at all. Also, by skipping the marinade, this becomes suitable for a very quick weeknight meal.

Wonderful dish!!!!! I made my own chipotles in adobo sauce so they would be extra spicy. Will definitely be making this recipe again!

Made this dish last night, delicious, we doubled the sauce and served it with a scotch bonnet/ carrot/rice side dish.

This was an excellent dish!!! I have made it several times. Instead of using the canned chipotle chilies, I used a dried chipotle chile. What a wonderful smokey flavor.
