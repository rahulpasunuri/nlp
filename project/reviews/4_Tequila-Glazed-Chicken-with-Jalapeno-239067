Delish! Rave reviews!

Delish. We made this exactly with the exception of using only one jalapeno and seeding it, as we are a couple of nancys. Really good, really easy. Give it a shot. We served it with green goddess salad and an olive french bread.

Delicious! A crowd pleaser for sure. I left out the jalapenos because I didn't want to over do the heat for the kids. Even the kids who "don't like flecks" on their food ate it up. Very good cold the next day, too.

Really, really good. I would agree with some of the previous reviews that the sauce is sweet (really sweet), but I doubled the recipe and only used one jalapeno. I love hot food, but this sauce was HOT. Anyway, I sliced up breasts & marinated them in the sauce for an hour. I skewered the chciken and brushed it with the sauce while griling. This came out FANTASTIC! Honestly, the heat and sweetness transferred over just enogh and made a fabulous dish. 4 forks, I would make this again. Double the recipe, 1 jalepeno, and could cut back on the brown sugar and honey just a bit. Oh, let the sauce cook about a half hour longer than what it says in order to thicken enough. Otherwise, super simple and super delicious to make.

This was the perfect meal for our fourth of july cookout! It was spicier than I expected, but the chicken was flavorful and moist. Some of my friends even carried their plates outside with them when the fireworks started! I'll definately be making this again and again this summer.

We loved it! I doubled the glaze and when I tasted it, I thought it was way too spicy, so I added an extra cup of pineapple juice and some more brown sugar. I still thought the glaze was way too spicy, but it turned out amazing. It's the BEST grilled chicken I have eaten. Will be making it over and over again.

This is a great recipe that got rave reviews. I too used only 1 Tbsp of both honey and brown sugar as I don't like things too sweet. I also added about 1 tsp of lime juice at the end of cooking the sauce. It gave it a lift and just seemed to fit with the tequila!

Every time I make this it gets raves. It's very easy and keeps well for a few days.

I used orange juice, gold tequila, a combination of green jalapeno and habanero, and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. And I thought it was only okay--flavorful but one-dimensional; tasted like Tobasco. Maybe my modifications ruined the recipe? Regardless, the boyfriend really liked it so I'll probably make it again.

Wonderful!! Wonderful!! I doubled the glaze and still could have made more. The chicken and glaze were gobbled up and had rave reviews from everyone. I'm making it again today. Yum!!!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. We were tried of the same old BBQ Chicken, so we tried this recipe. The flavors are amazing and well balanced. We make it all the time now and it is my go to dish when we have friends or family over, especially now that it is summer. Instead of cooking for 15 minutes we sear it then move it to indirect heat and cook for an addtional 30 minutes. The result is moist and cripsy chicken.

Good, but much sweeter than I was expecting! I think most people like it as is, judging from the reviews, but if you're not a sweet person, cut back on either the honey or sugar. Overall, I would make it again.

Absolutely Terrible! I love to cook and have made numerous successful recipes from this site. I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients, but since it received a 4 fork rating and I had the ingredients on hand, I thought I would try it. Save the Tequila for Margaritas!

I normally wouldn't give 5 forks to a chicken recipe but this one stands out. The marinade and glaze really come through and give a plain old chicken some real character! I doubled the glaze and it disappeared.

Excellent! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Meat was very moist and flavor great!

Rating: 4
WOW! Made it twice already. First time with chicken breasts and the next time with Salmon. Both were terrific. I didn't make enough Salmon though so I've got to do it again. I would quadruple the glaze if I do it again. I doubled it the 2nd time and not enough. We used 4 jalapeno's the 2nd time and it was just about the right temp. The meat is exceptionally moist and tender using this recipe. More tequila in the cook next time too!

Truly delicious. Tequila adds a unique dimension.

Very disappointing. The glaze/sauce was tasty by itself, but the completed dish was too bland -- and I used a very large, very hot jalapeno from my own garden, where I have 9 different kinds of hot pepper growing this year. If I were to make this dish again -- which I probably will not do -- I would use twice as much sauce for half as much chicken.

I made a slight change in this recipe I made it with A pork tender loin that I butterflied and stuffed I used 1/2 jalapeno pepper and 1 whole Ceyanne pepper yummy

Made this for a summer BBQ. My guests loved it. The perfect amount of spice!

Rating: 4
Loved it! The orange juice in the glaze is what makes the dish so great. The sugar from the orange juice sort of caramelizes on the chicken while grilling, making it sticky and sweet and verrry moist. The flavors were really delicious, the prep straight forward, and the chicken so good. I would make it again in a flash.

I am always looking for new chicken recipes to serve on our weekend sailing trips. This one received 4 flags from the captain and crew. So as not the have to contend with bones I use 4 deboned, skin-on chicken breasts, made the glaze (used 2 jalapeno)the night before then heated just before grilling the chicken (9 min/side). Served with pineapple salsa. A great recipe that has been included in the boat's recipe log.

I was not impressed by this dish, Would not make it again

Wow! This is exceptional. I followed the recipe exactly for perfect results. The Arugula Peach Salad with Chive Vinegrette goes beautifully with this dish.

Delicious! The sweet and spicy glaze is addicting. Next time I will double the glaze recipe so there is enough to use on the table.

I really liked it. My husband and son enjoyed it, but didn't rave. Pretty easy. The chicken turned out cooked through, but wonderfully moist. If you want it spicy - increase the # of jalapenos in the recipe.

Made this last night and it was terrific. I put the rub on earlier in the day and used orange juice in the glaze, which was really hot. (I had a very large jalapeno in it.) I didn't need the glaze on the finished chicken; it was tasty and hot enough without it. Definitely worth a regular rotation.

Rating: 1
As others have noted, the chicken was wonderfully moist. However, for those of us who don't eat chicken skin the effort was a disappointment. While the rub and glaze seemed quite flavorful, none of the flavor made its way into the flesh. Perhaps my expectation was simply unrealistic.

I followed the directions except used pre-ground coriander and used 2 serrano chiles (store didn't have red jalapenos). I left the chicken with dry-brine overnite and made the sauce just prior to grilling. I was a little apprehensive b/c the sauce didn't smell or look particularly good, but I turned it all over to my grilling husband and half an hour later, we had gorgeous, perfectly moist, flavorful chicken. For sides, I did corn on the cob and an arugula/parmesan salad. Definitely will make again soon!

Wow, this was so simple and really exceptional! Next time I will double the recipe because there was nothing left! Instead of grilling all the way, I baked for half hour and then finished on the grill, really super flavor and texture!

Wow! I doubled the recipe and also did with skewered shrimp (16/20) for some seafood lovers and the serving tray was sopped clean. 6 friends now have this recipe!

Perfection! Works with any type of cut of chicken. I gave it 4 forks since I didn't change anything and it was perfect as is! Try it tonight!

I'm looking foward to making this recipe. What did other cooks serve as a side dish?

Rating: 4
What a crowd pleaser! I used turkey thighs and turkey legs - the glaze was flavorful enough to not get lost on dark meat turkey. If you want to kick up the heat, just include some (or all) of the jalepeno seeds.

Rating: 4
A terrific chicken recipe, if not the best chicken recipe I have ever prepared. I used one large jalapeno pepper instead of two average sized peppers, which appeared to be just the right amount of heat, without overpowering the taste of the tequila. I will prepare this recipe many times in the future

I made this exactly as directed and it was delicious--good enough to rival the island pork tenderloin on this site for it's flavors and bang for your effort. The only thing I might change next time is to use a little less corriander. Will definitely make again!!

This is a great recipe. The first time we made it, everyone was left looking for more, so it has become a regular.

Great tasting chicken. Used one teaspoonof dried chili flakes in the basting sauce instead of jalepeno. Very yummy just watch out for the basting sauce catching alight.

Expected a sweet and spicy dish...and we found a treasure. It is a bit sweet and a small bit spicy (with the one jalapeno), but it is full of juicy flavor. My family, including my 3 year old daughter, loved it and gobbled it up!

I tried this because I do a lot of grilling and get tired of chicken. It has a lot of flavor and a slight kick.

I'm always looking for a new way to prepare grilled chicken, and this was a hit. Very easy to prepare. My guests loved it and I'm serving it again tonight for another dinner party.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. Very easy to prepare. I prepared it all ahead and then brought it to a friends house and they grilled it! Not a piece was left and we used the leftover glaze with some grilled London Broil that was served. Everyone raved. This recipe is a definite keeper! I used two jalapenos and it was perfect, spicy and sweet!

Fairly easy with minor advance planning. I made it almost as directed-- used powdered coriander instead. I will deifnitely make this recipe again.
