I love, love, love this dish--one of my favorites; the only reason it has three forks instead of four is that my husband is rather indifferent to it. To his mind, the beans overwhelm everything else, and that's a big no-no. He doesn't like things that taste like vegetables. I end up halving the beans in his portion, and putting them in mine, and I may up the quotient of sambal to "re-educate" his palate as well. Still a great dish.

This was really great and I'm glad I tried it out as there are a lot of flavours here that I don't normally prefer. Trying to expand horizons. All the flavours melded really well and as someone said previously, it was nice to have a stir-fry with flavours other than the standard. Making it again next week!

This was really delicious- though I was skeptical of the chutney. The only changes I made were chili garlic sauce for sambal oelek, and no pea shoots or daikon sprouts.

I am always looking for ways to disguise pork tenderloin from my husband and this fit the bill. What I loved was it's so easy to use what you have on hand for the veggies. I used snow peas, savory cabbage, cutup radishes (for daikon) and skipped the bean sprouts because they had gone bad already. This is a keeper.

Delish! I made it to use up some leftover pork and didn't have the sprouts or cabbage on hand, but it was fantastic nonetheless. Much better than our usual take-out. Try it!

This stir fry is excellent, with or without the pork. I've made it as written,and I've used the sauce to stir fry a mixture of veggies as a side dish. Both ways, it was gobbled up by the kids (7 and 5) and the adults.

Delicious! Made this to use up leftover Thai Pork Tenderloin. Did not have peanut oil, could not find the daikon or snow pea shoots but loved the end result. Served it with Jasmine Rice. Def will keep this recipe. Very easy if you have everything prepared before starting to cook.

Another different and delicious stirfry. The sauce is really tasty so serve with rice to eat it all up. The cilantro really adds to this dish. I get tired of the same soya sauce stirfry so I'm always looking for something different. If you like this, then you should try the Singapore Lamb Curry - pork works really well in it - it's a dry curry that's a really nice change from the ordinary.

This was pretty good, but the meat itself tasted bland. Next time I will cut the pork in smaller strips, and marinate first with some cornstarch & soy, or some variation on that. We thought the sauce was good.

A good dish for a work night dinner. The whole family enjoyed it. Next time I will add mushrooms and a little more sambal oelek.

It's a blend of equal parts dried and ground: anise seed, anise pepper, fennel seeds, cloves and cinnamon. You can get Chinese five-spice blends at any Asian market or supermarket. They'll carry several brands and various quantities. If you haven't been to the spacious and well organized "99 Ranch Market" in Arcadia, CA, it's worth a visit. They even carry live seafood--which they will de-bone and fry upon request (at no charge). We have one in San Diego and it's always come through for me when I'm in need of any Asian food or ingredient.

What is Chinese 5 spice powder?

This is an excellent dish and a definite keeper

I did a few substitutions: namely hoisin for chutney since I didn't have any on hand, yellow onion for red and a reduction of the amount of oil, and it was still lovely. Very easy, flavorful and fresh tasting. Will make again and again.

I might use hoisin rather than Major Grey's chutney,personal preference. I doubled the chili paste and used radish sprouts. Together they were hot and really needed the sweetness in the sauce which sank to the bottom of the wok. Next time, I'll thicken the sauce with cornstarch and leave the chili paste at the recommended level -it can always be added afterwards. The sweet/ hot combo is a yummy one.

Absolutely marvellous dish! Also much easier than it looked at first sight. The chutney gives a nice sweet taste; I used quite a lot. It combines perfectly with the anise-like taste of the five-spice. Apart from that it's also a very complete meal; no need to cook extra vegetables.

My husband said this was the best pork stir-fry I've made! I loved all the vegetables in the dish. I didn't have the Indonisian chili paste and had to use a similar chili sauce and uses sesame oil to cook instead of peanut(health reasons). I also marinated the pork strips in some sherry, soy sauce and the 5-spice powder for a few hours before cooking, adding more depth to the pork. I'm certain we will have this dish again!

A really fast and easy stir-fry recipe. I enjoyed the use of the 5-spice. I also used extra chili sauce, ginger and garlic (but not quite doubled). I like my sauce to be thicker, so I dissolved a tablespoon of cornstarch into the sauce while I cooked the vegetables, then let the sauce come to a full boil for a few minutes to thicken, before adding it to the entire dish. I find there is no need to pre-fry the bean sprouts, you can add them with the cilantro, etc. at the very end. The residual heat of the stir-fry warms them through, and they stay crisp, without being raw or soggy (from overcooking).

The combinaton of the pork and vegetables was good, but the sauce was far too sweet. If I were to make it again (unlikely) I'd eliminate the chutney and experiment with hoisun or another sauce. At least double the amount of garlic and chili paste.

I enjoyed this dish. It is the kind of dinner you make when you are in the mood to try a different flavor chinese meal. I agree that you need to increase the amount of spice.

Though by far not the best Asian-style dish I've ever made, it's not the worst, either--it's a decent, fast dish I'd make again, with a pleasant and different kind of sauce. Make sure to increase the garlic, ginger, and chilli sauce (especially the chilli sauce!), decrease the water, and let the sauce boil 5 minutes or so to reduce and thicken, as it tends to be too thin. As people have said, this is good with different kinds of veggies. I like using red onion with green pepper and mushrooms. The cilantro (add some chopped scallion greens too) and sesame oil at the end really help the interest level here.

My family really enjoyed the different flavor. I used chicken instead of pork and added a handful of toasted pine nuts for crunch. It is definitely a keeper.

So easy to prepare. Wonderful taste. I think I would add a bit more garlic, also. I did not have the chile paste, so used red pepper flakes instead. I used snow pea pods in place of the pea shoots. Could add a just about any vegetables. I also stirfried the vegetables in order of their thickness. We like our veggies crispy to the bite. Both my husband & I said it was a keeper.

This dish is full of flavor and easy to prepare. I added more garlic and seasoned the pork with garlic powder and a touch more of Chinese 5 spice in addition to the salt and pepper stated in the recepie. I also suggest trying other vegetables. The possibilities are tasty and endless!
