No, I do believe Central Washington is right. Snapper fool is best served with Yum Bunnies. I give it at least 3 forks!

I don't get the review (suggestion) below. Does the snapper replace the passion fruit, the sugar or the cream? Dont'cha just love a nice little computer glitch every now and then?
