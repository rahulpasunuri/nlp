try making this with fresh lemon or lime juice and a couple dashes of bottled hotsauce. this is a typical weekend tequila or beer snack!

I really liked these, but my guests didn't seem to share my enthusiasm...maybe because there was also a plate of oranges, olive oil and honey available? Anyway, I thought they were perfect - delicious with margharitas!
