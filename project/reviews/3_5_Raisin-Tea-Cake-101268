I've been using and playing with this recipe for years. Here are my observations and tips: First, a springform pan is a must. A regular cake pan is just not sufficient. Second, I have tried this recipe with GREAT success with all kinds of dried fruit, not just raisins. Usually during the holidays we have loads of recipes that call for dried cranberries, cherries, apricots, etc. We usually wind up with a leftover stash of dried fruit, and this recipe is wonderful for using up the bits and pieces. I have used all kind of dried fruit in this cake, and have been very happy with the results. (Using the dried apricots, I just threw them in the Cuisinart and chopped them to the size of raisins, measured out three cups, and presto!) It's also worked well for combining "leftover" dried fruits to make a total of 3 cups. I don't cook this with liquor - although it sounds great - so I'm not sure if you were adding cherries/cranberries/apricots, etc., what kind of booze you'd add. I'm off now to try it our with dried plums. We have a stash leftover from another recipe and this cake seems to be calling out for them! Enjoy!

The cake is very nice. I added a 1/2 cup of Irish whiskey and adjusted spices a bit. Baking time was longer, took about an hour and a half. You can see the photo in my blog http://www.bakingobsession.com/2008/03/16/irish-raisin-cake/

I wanted to have a non-chocolate dessert for a holiday luncheon I hosted. This foot the bill. It was moist and not too sweet even with all of the raisins. I did not have all of the spices so I used my Chinese five spice as a very good substitute. Everyone said this was a "keeper."

THE best raisin cake I have ever made! Moist, full of flavours, excellent!

I will play with this recipe before I repeat it. I made it as written, with the exception of a few more raisins (about 1/2 cup), as I couldn't see using almost an entire package, and I love raisins! The flavor of the raisins is wonderful, and is what saves the cake, which I feel is somewhat bland and rather dry. I may try adding some buttermilk or yogurt to the batter, in an attempt to moisten the cake. I like that it's not so sweet, but I would like the flavor of the spices to permeate the cake as well, and I didn't feel that it happened. Perhaps a little of the spice blend in the flour mix? I'll try again, but right now it's not on the "regular" list yet.

Daniel Collison of Juneau, Alaska is my hero! Once I started making the recipe, I realized he was right about so many things, including the pan size (I used a 10" springform pan). I used a 1/2 c Irish whisky, instead of brandy, which DID loosen up this rather thick batter & instead of grinding up those spices, I used 3/4 T of pumpkin pie spice + 1/4 tsp ea ground cloves & coriander. The cake wasn't as moist as I expected it to be, so I served it with freshly whipped cream laced w/ whisky. It was a great addition to our St. Patrick's Day dinner.

Great cake recipe. A few suggestions, though. First, I added 1/2 cup of brandy to the recipe. I cooked raisins, spices, sugar and water as indicated. When cool, I added brandy. No need to refrigerate overnight. The brandy helps to thin the batter, and it lends a nice flavor to the cake. Second, I baked in a 9-1/2" springform pan. A regular cake pan would be quite inadequate. Overall, a great recipe. A definite keeper.

This is such a big, beautiful cake! It winds up looking like a one-layer chocolate cake, so you have to convince everyone there's no chocolate in it. I baked mine in a 9-3/4-inch x 2-1/2-inch non-stick springform pan, which worked very well. I can't help but think this would be wonderful with a little Irish whiskey-laced whipped cream on top...

THE best coffe-cake type recipe I've ever tried. We have this several times a year.
