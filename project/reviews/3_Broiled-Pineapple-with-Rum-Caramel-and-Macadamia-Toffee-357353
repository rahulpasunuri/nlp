This was very tasty. Pineapple didn't need much brown sugar -- I didn't come close to a 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet. The rum caramel is amazing -- best part of the dish. I'm iffy on the toffee -- the crunch was nice and the macadamia flavor meshed well, but it added even more sugar. Next time, I might just toast some chopped macadamias and sprinkle on instead.
