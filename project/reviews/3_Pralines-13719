I am not sure how one can have too many pecans, but ok, if you do, this would be a good use of them. I myself never ever have too many pecans. I live in a pecan grove and still run out before the next year's nuts fall. If you don't like grainy, try the other 1991 version of this recipe.

My family and friends LOVE these pralines! After making them many times, I've tweaked the process a bit: first, toast the pecans. It brings out the flavor. Once it's cooked, I drop spoonfuls of the praline mixture into individual foil cupcake liners: nothing to oil, and the pralines are ready to serve/wrap/tote to picnics/whatever.

Please note, the measurement for grains is not the same as for liquids. 8oz does not equal a cup in grains. In grains, 2oz = 1/2 cup. So this recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of pecans. A 10oz bag of pecans will give you the 2 1/2 cups. I did not know this at first, so I used a 16oz bag of pecans. Kinda nutty, but still tasty.

I made this twice; once for a catering, once to take to a party. I followed the recipe the same, but once it came out crumbly (sugar probably got too hot) and the other time, way too moist. With some practice for timing and temperature. I think this would work well. Flavor was great though.

Great, brings back memories of trips to the River-Front shops in Savanah.

I found I needed to cook the sugar a little bit longer than called for in the recipe. And-, they were grainly -- just like from New Orleans! Delicious. What a wonderful traditional recipe.

The flavor was a nice praline flavor, HOWEVER, the texture was grainy and it NEVER firmed up as a praline should. I followed directions exactly to the 'T' and still I ended up pressing it into a container and serving like a fudge.

This recipe turned out great! I took the whole thing, minus a few for myself, to a party and the whole batch was eaten in just a few minutes. Everyone was asking me for the recipe. One thing -- there is a learning curve involved. The first few I made were very ugly, but tasty none the less

Texture was a little grainy, and not very flavorful.

Wonderful pralines. I used my KitchenAid mixer on '2' for about 10-12 minutes before it lost its luster, became a creamy light color, like latte.

A great way to get rid of too many pecans! A touch of cinnamon and/or maple syrup (or even maple flavoring) adds a bit of a southwest flair to this one.
