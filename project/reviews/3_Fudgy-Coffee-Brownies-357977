Thought this recipe was excellent. My husband doesn't like coffee and he enjoyed the flavor. It is more cake like. Very moist. My modifications: I did not have unsweetened chocolate in the house. I used semi-sweet and cut back on the sugar about 1/2 c. I did 1/2 T of cinnamon, used instant coffee - not espresso. I would make this again. Cook time was on target.

Loved these! I like cinnamon in chocolate. Only thing I altered is that I left out one egg because I like brownies really dense. Made these for a luncheon and they went fast!

These brownies were too cakey and not chocolately enough for my taste. The former could probably be addressed by reducing to 4 eggs. But to address the chocolately issue I'll probably just poke around for another recipe.

great consistency but there is a little of the egg flavor coming through all that chocolate (after all..FIVE EGGS are in there!!). It would be 4 forks had I doubled the espresso powder and added a little more suger to hide the egg taste.

This was a good dessert. The coffee threw me a little off gaurd because I didnt read it clearly. But over all it was pretty good.

The brownies tasted better shortly after cooling at room temperature. I think the coffe enhanced the chocolate flavor and gave it a special taste without tasting like coffee. However, after placing the brownies in the fridge, I didn't really care for the taste or the chewy fudge like texture. I am not really a brownie lover so I will not be making this again. But if you love brownies it is a good and simple recipe.

I made these for my Super Bowl party and they went very quickly! I really enjoyed them. I used following modifications: 1/2 Tablespoon cinnamon and since I like vanilla I used 1 2/3 tsp vanilla. I found they were perfect after baking for 25 minutes.

These are okay. Nothing special. I agree about the cinnamon. I recommend reducing it to 1/2 tablespoon.

These are great with a little tweaking. I've made them twice, first time according to the recipe and second with some changes. I found like some others that the cinnamon flavor was too strong and the coffee too weak. I added double the instant espresso (4tbsp) and only 2tsp of cinnamon. Much better and more balanced flavor, also the texture is great!

They needed alot more time then 25-30 min I left them in more than an addditional 15 min and they were still too fudgy. Also found the cinnamon a bit overwhellming. It is a delicious and easy recipe but it definitely needs tweaking. Gonna try it with less cinnamon next time and more bake time.

These brownies were great! Fudgey and cakey, yes, but still delicious. I brought them to work and they were gobbled up. Also I added some walnuts and they fit in nicely. Recommended!

I make these brownies without the espresso and without the cinnamon. The reviews from my co-workers are that they are the BEST brownies they have had. Great texture.. sort of between cake and chewy. I am going to try to make them with some additions just for fun.

I was mislead with the picture, the brownies came out cakey. Would not make again.

I was dying for chocolate brownies, and trying to find a really simple receipt without too much extra stuff (chips, topping, etc). After converting some super fancy, expensive 100% cacao Valrhona cocoa powder (3 Tbs powder plus 1 of oil) in lieu of baking chocolate, and leaving out the cinnamon and espresso (I didn't have any instant), I found these to be perfectly rich, chocolaty, with excellent texture. I realize that's a lot of recipe changes, but all I wanted was plain brownies, and these were awesome. I bet if you like brownies with other flavors, the original would still rock.

was a very easy recipe to make the expresso powder works well with the choclate but would sugesst makeing a paste with the powder to bring out more of the coffee flavor
