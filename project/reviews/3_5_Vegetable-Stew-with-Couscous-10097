By itself this recipe is bland, and it doesn't serve a whole lot if you plan this as the main dish. But, it's a great starting point. I added Ras al Hanout, as one reviewer suggested, but with the vinegar it was a weird flavor. I would suggest halving the amount to start with. But then I added a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter - and wow! My husband loved it! Also, I bulked up the dish by adding extra veggies (zucchini and green beans), upped the raisins to 1/2 cup and threw in some meat for protein. I'm sure that chick peas would have been a great in place of the meat, but we can't do legumes, so that wasn't an option for us. I also thought the crunch of some pine nuts would have made this dish just about perfect but didn't have any in the house. Will have to keep that in mind for the next time.

As vegetarians, we are always looking for fun creative and delicious recipes and this one did it for us! With the right amount of salt and ground pepper, I felt it was spot on. Very warm, hearty, comforting and not bland at all. I was apprehensive about the size of the squash so I cut them to 1 1/2" cubes and it turned out great! I found the cooking times to be slightly longer. What an absolutely healthy and tasty dish!

Quite tasty if you add a tablespoon or more of Ras al Hanout. I did this when I started cooking the squash.

Tasty, but make it only if you are terribly fond of butternut squash. I like the flavor it offered, but not the large chunks. Loved the onions, raisins, and swiss chard --- and the broth, which gives the stew a "comfort food" quality.

Fantastic vegetarian dish... a thick, rich sauce and hearty vegetables. A nice change from the usual recipes from this venue. With a bit of tweaking, since it's a tad bland, this would rate "4 forks". Had to use spinach for the greens - swiss chard was unavailable - but the spinch was great.

A little bland until we added some tabasco!

Slammin'. Hearty, flavorful, goes down nice and easy. A nice stand by.

A great recipe! Especially good in the fall, or on rainy days. A vegetarian dish that meat-eaters love!

Very bland dish, course ground pepper really helped
