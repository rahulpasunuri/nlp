We added thinly sliced onions and some shaved parmesan, and this is about the best tomato based salad we've ever had. A new "regular" for us.

Quintessential summer dish when the tomatoes are ripe and flavorful! I chose 3 different colored heirlooms and they looked stunning on the plate with the capers and basil. Simple and rewarding!

I made this recipe as close to how it was written here, I only used one large tomato so everything had to be cut back. This was just wonderful, I let it sit for an hour to mellow the flavors. ,Michigan tomatoes are ,not in season yet so I bought mine from Hemeters market in Saginaw, they have perfected a way to grow them in a greenhouse and still get great flavor. Vermont review X9 really!

Wow. I have never seen so many people so stuck on one detail. Obviously one of the main ingredients and last word is BASIL. If you look at a live basil plant it could have possibly been either the new buds or as someone else pointed out it could be a specific basil plant. Nowhere did the recipe call for thyme and I have enough confidence in Epicurious to represent an authentic picture. I never thought of caprese because it lacks balsamic and would not need shallots. This recipe, by itself looks scrumptious and I can't wait to try it. I will make sure to hide my Thyme, just in case.

When I was a kid, Mom had a similar recipe using rolled fillets of anchovy rather than capers, but used only 1 per 2 slices of tomato. Also put 1 mashed fillet in the dressing. My family loves anchovies, but now I love capers too.

The key here is fresh herbs. Thyme, basil, oregano, mint, parsley, whatever. Try it with different vinagers as well. Super thin slices of cukes, or garlic. Let yourself go, it's summer........ As Pete the Cat says " It's all Good!"

Ignore the picture. Follow the recipe.

This looks good for later in the summer, when the big tomatoes are in. Strongly suspect that the basil in the picture is in the same family as what I've just planted, ie Pistou, a miniature basil with somewhat pointed, TINY leaves.

I just made this dish for lunch and it was terrific. I mixed the capers in with the dressing and used a sweet onion instead of shallots. Fresh basil from the garden made it so tasty! Took no time at all to prepare the dish.

Not a review, but a comment/question - the herb in the picture is NOT basil - looks suspiciously like thyme. What gives?

I, too, noticed that the photo shows thyme, not basil! Wondered whether the recipe was wrong or the photo. Thyme is definitely inferior to basil with tomatoes and vinaigrette. Would rate this: Three forks if with basil; no forks if with thyme. Four forks if with fresh mozzarella for a true caprese salad.

Photo seems to show thyme not basil. Personally I think basil is the better choice as uncooked thyme would overpower this salad. I'm just saying...

Great way to highlight tomatoes. Have always had tomatoes with salt and pepper, but this just takes them over the top. Can't wait till my garden tomatoes are ready. May add sliced fresh Mozzarella for a little extra, though.

This is fabulous and has been served (in my house) at Sunday breakfast for years. All this salad needs is lox, bagels and onions.
