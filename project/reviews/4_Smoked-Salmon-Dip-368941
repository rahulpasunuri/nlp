No creme fraiche was available, and since nothing was being heated here, I used Greek-style yogurt. I halved the recipe. The consistency was not where I wanted it, and I decided to make it more interesting. I added 3 oz of cream cheese (not from tub) and gave it a shake of garlic powder. The taste improved the next day,as the ingredients had time to blend.

Since I am not a huge fan of smoked salmon I used half smoked salmon and half sockeye salmon. I also added capers and lemon juice as per other reviewer. It is a nice, easy recipe and a light summer appetizer. I served it with flax bread crisps and endive lettuce leaves.

Based on my meager pantry and fridge supplies, I used goat cheese instead of yoghurt and chopped dill instead of chives -- but this was still fantastic. Will definitely make it again.

This was an easy and elegant dish for a large cocktail party. I would definitely echo some of the earlier comments: 1. add more lemon juice 2. add more horseradish (I used almost twice what was called for, and next time I might also try some cayanne) 3. the recipe makes A LOT. I would halve the recipe for a party of 15.

This recipe was a hit at the Christmas party. I wanted to feature local products and salmon was definitely on the list. I think what made this recipe a success was adding wasabi as well as the horseradish. It tasted rather anemic with only the horseradish so I went with a little asian horseradish (wasabi) as well. Just add it to taste. I should also mention that I used Lox instead of dry smoked salmon. Enjoy

Terrific recipe. So easy and makes so much! You could easily half it for a small crowd. We took the advice of others and added capers, lemon to the cream mixture, and a touch more horseradish. It was perfect. Next time, we are going to try smoked trout (half the price of smoked salmon, if you are watching your pennies) and another time, smoked bluefish.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was very well received. It is drop dead easy and I will use it as a start off point in the future. I might add lemon or capers or cayenne or whatever moves me in the future. Panko crusted Meyer lemon slices make a nice garnish.

Perfect addition to a Christmas party buffet! Used homemade créme fraiche made from great local cream. Served it with Trader Joe's whole grain mini rye toasts. Half a recipe was just right for the party but now I wish I had some left!!!

Delicious and easy! Think I might add a bit more horseradish but everyone loved it just the way it is. I'll definately make this again.

Three and a half forks. This is a sure crowd-pleaser and very easy to make in a pinch. I added 2tbsp fresh lemon juice and fine zest from half a lemon directly into the cream mix, before adding salmon. Gave it a bit more dimension, which I think is necessary. Next time I might add cayenne or capers to see how it works. This will be my go-to for potlucks and as an easy pre-dinner snack when guests come over.

Made this dip for a holiday neighborhood party and got rave reviews! i used a cream (new baking creme?) cheese with some lemon added instead of the hard to find creme fraiche, and added just a bit of cayenne pepper, served it with the "everything" flat bread crackers. I loved it and it was SO easy and FAST!
