Loved It! Fast and Easy to make. I increased the mushroom portion and we enjoyed eating the extra mix cut up on Hors D'Oeuvre crackers later.

This was pretty good. I would recommend slicing the mushrooms thinner than the recipe calls for...they took awhile to cook through and were too meaty. I had a lot of tahini sauce left over...if you make 1/3 of it, you'll still have plenty.

I thought this recipe was GREAT! so quick and easy to make and very very tasty. I used half of a medium onion rather than a large one and I used ciabatta rolls for the bread.

This sandwich is easy and delicious; my husband requests it all the time for dinner. I serve it on a wrap or stuffed in a pita bread, usually omit the tomato and add shredded lettuce and radicchio. Also, I think a mellow cheese goes better with it than Swiss.

i generally make a recipe exactly as written the first time, and then decide what changes if any, would suit our tastes better. i honestly can't say i can figure this one out! the mushroom mixture was overly spicy and the tahini suace tasted neither "nutty" nor like the ranch dressing that went into it. and the flavor of the swiss cheese was totally lost on us. this is only the 2nd time i've tried a recipe on this site and said i wouldn't make it again but i just can't recommend it.

I served this for a friend for lunch and it was so good, I made it again for my husband a few days later. It was quick, easy to make and delicious! I served it as a sandwich rather than open-faced on crusty,Tuscan round bread lightly toasted in the broiler.

These are really good! I used a homemade ranch dressing, which turned out great with the added tahini and milk. I served them on whole grain buns, but next time I would probably serve them open face like the other reviewer. Worth doing again for sure.

Got rave reviews from all guests. Served it open face because I thought it would look more dinnerish than a sandwich and used garlic butter on the bottom toast layer.
