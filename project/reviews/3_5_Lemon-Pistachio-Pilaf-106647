The receipe was AWESOME...until I added the strips of lemon peel. Then it was over-the-top lemony. I will make it again and skip the lemon peel. It was just TOO lemony after that was added (I tasted it before I added it).

I've made this a number of times always as written except for pistachios. First time I couldn't find them so substituted pine nuts. It was a tremedous hit! I am asked to bring this dish to group dinners frequently - always with pine nuts now.

Made this as a side dish for dinner (chicken, steak and veggie kabobs) last night with neighbors and everyone loved it. I loved the lemon flavor and will definitely be making this again.

The lemony zing works wonderfully with seafood. I regularly pair this pilaf with ahi tuna in a cilantro, lime and shiitake cream sauce and a stinging-nettle gomaii. Every guest I've made this for has been besides themselves with glee. Glee.

We thought this was a very good recipe. I only had about 1/4 cup lemon juice, but still could taste the lemony flavor. Didn't change one thing about the recipe. I've also made the recipe on this site with dill, basmati rice, and pistachios - my husband said he likes this one much better.

Absolutely horrible! I followed the recipe to a t but found it bland and a waste of pistachios and lemon. I will feed the many leftovers to the dogs.

I found this very tasty. The rice had a very pleasant light lemon taste and the pistachios added a nice touch. Can't wait to make this again.

Excellent side dish for serving with fish. Everyone loved it. I found shelled unsalted pistachios at Trader Joes.

I substituted cashews and used basmati rice which gave it a hint of India. But my guests and I definitely enjoyed the big lemon flavour. I thought the flavours would develop nicely over night in the leftover rice but I found it was surprisingly blah the next day. The fresh rice definitely has more zing than the day old.

Good, basic rice recipe. I used toasted pinenuts instead of the pistachios, and added some chopped parsley for color. I'll definitely make this one again.

Great recipe with excellent flavors. Could not locate unsalted pistachios, so used toasted pine nuts instead. I will definitely use this one again!

I have made this several times since it appeared in the June issue. Everyone always rave about it. I use almonds rather than pistachios and stir in a lot of fresh parsley before serving. I love the lemony flavor it imparts. I did notice the rice could be cooked longer but overall this is a great dish and I will continue to make it. Give it a try!

This dish was a wonderful with a mediterranean chicken marinated with plenty of garlic and meyer lemon, then roasted with figs and olives. I have been looking for just the right side, and this was it. Texturally and visually interesting-the strands of lemon peel and pistachio were nice little surprises in each bit. Guests loved it, and I am willing to bet that it will be better tomorrow.

This is so easy and flavorful. I made it with long grain brown rice and it was very rustic. I didn't mind shelling the pistachios. Only took about 10 minutes. Served it with the Dijon Chicken Breasts and Honey Wax beans and it was delish. We're looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow.

Have made this several times now, for both my employer (I'm a private chef) and for friends. A bit time consuming (shelling the pistachios) but worth it. I usually serve it with Sugar-seared salmon, also found on this site. Yummmm.

I prepared this dish for a catering job and it was a huge hit. ALl the guests had second helpings. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. A definite keeper.

Very tasty and interesting rice preparation. It went well with a rather simple main dish of grilled swordfish. I plan to make it again for a different group of guests. Thjis one goes into the permanent file!

I didn't enjoy this dish much at all. The lemon was way too overpowering and it was an odd bitter taste that was left in my mouth. My guests didn't like it much either even though it looked nice and the pistachios were a nice accent.

This was a very good rice dish - the lemon gives it a great fresh taste. I served it with Salmon with Chili Mango Salsa from Bon Appetite and it was great. Also good alongside the Roast Pork Calypso Style.

Very unusual side dish. Pistachios were a nice touch. It was tangy, yet tasty. Will make again for something different. Don't try to use as leftover--pistachios were squishy the second time around.
