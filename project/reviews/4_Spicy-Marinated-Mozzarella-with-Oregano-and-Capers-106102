Wonderful! Made it for a thanksgiving appetizer. Nice twist on standard sliced mozzarella. Served with roasted red peppers, toasted italian bread, artichoke hearts, prosciutto and sopressata. an italian dream!

Huge hit as appetizer at a dinner party. I've made this with the capers (add a little of the juice) and also without capers, but with some juice from green olives and a bit of lemon juice. Perfect wrapped in lavash. I've also served it with ciabatta. With a salad and/or soup, it can easily be a meal. Very filling.

Excellent. Made as written, and scattered green and black olives around platter to serve.

This appetizer is always a big hit with guests. The flavors are rich & different and it's a welcome exception to the same old caprese recipes. The olives, Salami and artichokes add an extra flair too. PLUS, it's quick & easy to make.

This has been a staple for me for a few years now. I serve it on an antipasto platter along with grilled eggplant, peppers, and zucchini, with a basket of sliced crusty baguette on the side. Everyone loves it. I use the small mozzarella balls, cut in half.

This was tasty but not exceptional.What I really liked was the ease of preparation. Not sure why it's called "marinated" since it's really only olive oil with garlic and herbs drizzled over the fresh mozz.

This was a great low-carb, healthy appetizer/ side dish. I got a little worried when the garlic got dark, but it was crunchy and tasty. My boyfriend and I loved it, and will definately be making it again. Maybe tonight!

I like all the ingredients separately, but together they just didn't do it for me. The garlic seemed to over-power the other flavors, and I even used less than called for.

Ooh, this was excellent! This will definitely be a permanent addition to my appetizer recipes collection! It really does come together quickly. I made the marinade the night before and chopped the oregano at the last minute. I took the advice of the other reviewers and added it after the marinade. I used the cherry-sized mozzarellas which were easier to eat as an appetizer and after assembling the cheese, marinade and oregano, squirted the entire thing with fresh lemon. Truly incredible.

Gosh I think I have made this now at least a dozen times since I found the recipe and I love it more and more every time! I am especially found of this recipe with some of our famous jersey fresh tomatoes!!! In addition to the tomatoes I had some basil infused olive oil on hand that gave it a nice touch. Definitely a keeper at our house!!!

I'm the Stephanie the reviewer (below) mentioned! Yes, without having made this dish myself, but only trying what she made, I decided I had to rate this recipe and give it 4 forks!! Since that evening I actually HAVE made this appetizer myself. I made it for several people as an appetizer before dinner and every single one wanted the recipe! I also added a combination of fresh oregano and fresh basil. Absolutely fantastic!!!!!

YUM!!! I made this as an appetizer for friends that invited me over for dinner one night. My friend Stephanie loved it so much she said that SHE was going to rate it!!I added fresh shredded basil and served with a non-flavored cracker. A real keeper...

Simple and delicious. It has become a staple of my appetizer repertoire, along with these other great Epicurious offerings: Polenta Triangles with Rosemary and Walnuts, Smoked Salmon Spirals, and Smoked Trout with Watercress on Tart Apple Slices.

Just like everyone said, this is a fantastic recipe! Easy, delicious, and very presentable. I served it to a group of skeptics - it was gone before I knew it. As recommended by past reviewers, I used basil instead of oregano and put the basil on last (after the marinade).

I've made this a number of times and it's a nice way to something slightly different with the age-old mozzarella appetizer. Be careful not to let the garlic cook too long - it will get crisp and slightly bitter (which some people like, and some people don't, so choose according to your taste).

Incredibly easy - I made a triple batch for a baby shower served with warm french bread - added squeezed juice from 1 fresh lemon - got endless complements and requests for recipe! Served with greek black olives...

Wonderful with basil or oregano. Easy and better if made ahead of time. I needed to drain it a little before serving, so it wasn't "swimming" in oil.

super quick, easy, & delicious- makes a nice presentation- I use the mini mozz balls instead of cutting up on of the larger ones.

Great, simple starter - my guests really enjoyed them. The capers were the perfect contrast to the creaminess of the mozzarella. One thing - the olive oil maybe needed a little something to lighten it, either vinegar or lemon juice perhaps? I will make them again and try it with a little juice. Very easy to do, which is good!

This dish is so simple yet elegent and the flavors blend beautifully....even with the amount of capers the recipe calls for. I served it on fresh French bread with salami. My guests absolutely raved about it.

I love this recipe, plus it's perfect for those on the Atkin's diet. The fresh mozz really absorbs the flavors well. Try a price club for the mozz to cut down on costs. It can be expensive. Excellent for a party.

A great way to serve fresh mozzarella, however, the flavour was a bit too strong. I think it would be perfect with 1/2 the capers.

This was very easy and quick, but I'd recommend putting the fresh oregano on top of the cheese after the marinade; otherwise its taste gets blunted by the olive oil.

This was great and very easy. It was a huge hit at a dinner party. I used individual plates and lined half the plate with 2 slices of sopressata and arranged the mozzarella and tomatoes on the other half.

this was a great recipe for those wholove mozarella - I served it with sliced salami & crackers - sliced sour dough would be tasty as well - the leftovers proved just as tasty! - loved the caper taste

I've made this a few times and it's always sure to get rave reviews, to say nothing of very simple to whip up. For a variation, I'll throw some fresh arugula on top of heirloom tomatoes and buffalo motz, it's delicious!

A really versatile and very easy to make appetizer. Served with a crusty baguette to mop up the juices,it is heavenly. Best made just before you eat it but the leftovers aren't bad either. A great way to eat fresh mozzarella which in my town is sold as bocconcini cheese.

I made this appetizer several months ago and it went over great. I tried it again yesterday and used fresh basil instead of oregano and once again it was a hit. I must also mention it looks quite impressive and does not take much effort. It's a winner.

What a refreshing change from the worn out mozzarella/tomatoes/basil appetizer. I served it with olives, artichoke hearts, garlic bread, and wild boar sausage with bourbon-molasses-mustard. Guests thought it was a wonderful spread. I had to encourage them to hold back for the main course! Next time I won't add the marinade until the last few minutes, cause after several hours in the frig, the dish looked a little tired and I had to flip it around for a fresher appearance.

This is a delightful appetizer. Really usual and my guests loved it. Even the children who attended the dinner party thought it was great. Served it with an assortment of whole grain crackers, olives, salami and breads.

Very, very, very easy. Pretty tasty. The mixture wasn't as "ground up" as I expected, which was probably my fault.

I made this recipe as part of an antipasto platter. I absolutely love fresh mozarella and this one is, by far, one of the best that I have tried. I cut the recipe in half and used just enough olive oil to coat it. Don't have a heavy hand in the spices....this is one time where you want to go by taste alone

This makes a wonderful appetizer and it's sooo easy. I put the mozzarella on top of fresh cut tomatoes and spoon the spicy olive oil on top.

This is an excellent appetizer. I've made it twice and the second time with fresh buffalo mozzarella--you could really taste the cheese. I also cut the olive oil way down and enjoyed it more with less oil.

Superb! In Dallas we are fortunate to have access to Paula Lambert's fresh Mozzarella Company cheese, and it is my son's favorite food. This recipe is elegantly simple, and the rich flavors beautifully complement the cheese. Thank you!

I made this last weekend. It was very good, but you must use good quality extra virgin olive oil and capers. Don't make it too spicy, however, or the flavor of the fresh cheese gets lost. Yum.
