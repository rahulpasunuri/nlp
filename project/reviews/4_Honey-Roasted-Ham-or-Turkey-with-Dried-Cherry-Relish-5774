This was absolutely fantastic! I had a very good quality ham and the dried cherry relish made is a wonderful Christmas dinner. I will definitely make this again!

Try raw sugar for a Flavorful touch. Opening with pear & Rosemary Martinis (see drinks) wins the crowd!

Delicious relish. The cherry/tosted nut/orange zest combination provides a combination of tastes that delight the palate. I served this with a baked turkey breast. Guests and spouse loved the taste. I did change the proportions of the ingredients a bit for my smaller group and added a bit more cream de cassis. Definately a winner! I'll bet it will go well with pork loin too.

the cherry relish has become a requested favorite at our family Easter meal- I made it once with mixed dried berries when I could not fond dried cherries and it was delicious too!

We had this for Thanksgivng and the cherry relish was a huge hit. It was decided that the relish would also be very tasty over ice cream.
