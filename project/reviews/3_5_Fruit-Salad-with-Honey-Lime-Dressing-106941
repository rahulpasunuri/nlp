A quick, easy, and tasty fruit salad. I used 2% Greek yogurt because that's what I had on hand. I think regular yogurt would be too runny. I also added lots of chopped fresh mint over the fruit. The recipe is very flexible you can use almost any fresh fruit you have on hand. I used watermelon, strawberries, green grapes, bananas, and fuji apples. I think serving toasted, slivered almonds or toasted coconut on the side would be great. Think I'll try that next time.

This salad is a fresh and delicious addition to any breakfast or brunch. I have made variations of it a number of times depending on what is in season, and have been very pleased every time. The dressing is perfect!

Lovely combination of flavours. For those who are having problems with runny yogurt, try using Greek yogurt. It's already strained (that's what makes it "Greek yogurt"), so it's beautifully thick and creamy. While you can cook with it or otherwise use it in the same way as sour cream, I've actually come to prefer it. Full-fat (10%) is tastiest, of course, but even 2% fat is pretty darned good...

I was not impressed with this recipe. The dressing is runny and the whole result was just cubed fruit in runny dressing. A light coating would have been fine.

yummy, but nothing too memorable...

Used 1/2 cup light sour cream, 2 tablespoons lime juice,2 tablespoons honey and 1 teaspoon lime peel. Also have used lemon juice and lemon peel and both make a wonderful dressing.The sour cream is thicker and does not need to be drained. Also I serve the fruit on an individual plate with the dressing drizzled on top. DELICIOUS!!

I've made it several times with great results. I've used bottled lime juice when no limes on hand which works though not as well. I serve it as dessert so I don't have to strain it since it won't sit for too long but for a buffet-type setting, I would definitely strain through a coffee filter or cheese cloth. We love it with watermelon . I can't believe they didn't include watermelon in the recipe, it's delicious with this sauce!

I absolutely LOVED the flavors so for me the recipe is a keeper. Would like the sauce thicker. I had no fresh limes so I used powdered lime that I keep on hand and that helps with the consistency by not watering it down.

ok, doesnt anyone use sour cream anymore? no yogurt in the house, so I subbed the sour cream, and it was just dandy. this goes with just about any fruit you like. I like using peaches, strawberries, mango & blueberries. great color, very yummy.

I'd make this again, but only after straining the yogurt for several hours (I was rushed and didn't read the reviews recommending this). But I still liked the yogurt, lime, and honey on the fruit, though it makes too much dressing (eyeball it). I used melon, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and green grapses.

I made the topping with the lime juice, lime zest, yogurt and honey. I used differents fruits though. (more berries and less melon) It was very good. Everyone loved it. I think that the topping would go with any fruit.

I really like how this recipe elevates a typical fruit salad into something much more. The tang of the lime along with the sweetness of the fruit is a treat for the tastebuds. This is a summer standard! If you are worried about the dressing getting runny, make your yogurt into cheese first. Just put a coffee filter in a strainer and put the strainer over a small bowl to catch the runoff. I often strain it overnight. And, like the recipe says, don't add the dressing until you are almost ready to serve!

The flavor was delicious, it was a bit runny, but only after several hours. I served it after tossing the fruit with the dressing and it was perfect then...however, it was a lot more runny a few hours later.

I really liked the dressing, but it lost its consistency and much of the flavor just a short time after mixing it in with the fruit. I drained the yogurt first as was suggested by another cook, and I can't imagine how runny it would have been otherwise. I will make the dressing again, but use it as a dip on the side instead.

This is great - I used different fruits and made the dressing w/Fage Total Greek Yogurt (2%) - the dressing is still runny b/c of all the lime juice but it has a wonderful tang and is a great compliment to the fruit.

I didn't read any of the reviews so I didn't drain the yogurt but got lots of compliments anyways. Prepared salad as per recipe but substituted bananas for papaya as store had no papayas. No complaints. Will definitely make it again.

Drained the yogurt as recommended by previous reviewers - I think its a must. Otherwise followed the recipe for the dressing and used cantaloupe, pineapple, red grapes, strawberries, and mango. The lime added a nice tang and since the fruit was slightly under ripe, the honey compensated. If you had especially ripe/sweet fruit, you could probably reduce the honey. Beautiful presentation with all the colors and flecks of lime zest.

Very good. I've made this recipe several times. Now, after reading other review, I'll try being more adventurous by useing different fruits.

Everyone loved this dish. I did not add the lime peel or the papaya (not my favorite fruit) and I also used vanilla yogurt instead of plain as some of the other reviewer recommended. I used a can of pineapple chunks, instead of the mess of a fresh pineapple.

The dressing in this recipe is my very favorite for fruit salad. I definitely recommend draining the yogurt as other reviewers suggested.

I brought this to work and people liked it. I liked it but probably won't make it again. All I could taste was the lime, and I don't think I added more lime juice or zest than the recipe called for. I would also leave out the papaya...not a fan of it.

I rarely dress fruit salad with anything more than lime and fresh ginger, but this is now my favorite! I used the recipe for 3 different events in one week! Everyone loved it! My personal favorite was using the dressing on strawberry and banana skewers! I tossed the bananas first, threaded the skewers and served extra dressing on the side. Fun, pretty and delicious! I had dressing left over and used it on bananas for breakfast.

Wow! I'm not even a fruit sald fan, but this was absolutely delicious. I did follow the advice in an earlier review and I used low-fat Vanilla yogurt and kept everything else the same. I got raves.

Excellent. Next time will leave the melon out. Used wonderful fresh strawberries, pineapples, bananas, and papaya, and topped with blueberries. I also drained the yogurt ahead of time, but also added in some meyer lemon juice to counteract some of the honey sweetness. I only used about 1/2 of the dressing on all the fruit, to let the fruit shine through.

Rating: 4
After several batches, I now add mango (nice tropical addition) and blueberries. I've used watermelon occasionally, although it seems to almost overpower the flavor of some of the more subtle fruits. As some of the other reviews stated, I double the zest. I also use whole milk French vanilla yogurt, and think the added calories really richen up this beautiful breakfast treat.

I served this at our Super Bowl party (trying to feel better about the sausages and pizzas). Everyone loved it. I used non-fat vanilla yogurt, strained it and also used about 2/3 the recommended lime juice. I used all fresh fruits, strawberries, blackberries, mango, pineapple, mandarins, kiwi, 1 pink lady apple, and 1 banana. As it does leave you with quite a bit of dressing I also had fruit salad for breakfast.

When I made this I hadn't read the suggestions to strain the yogurt to make it thicker. It is a MUST. I thought this was terrible and was embarassed to take it to the party I had promised to make it for. Don't waste perfectly good fruit on this recipe as is. Try the suggestions of the ones who liked it. They must have done something I didn't.

Lovely fruit salad, a real treat! As suggested by other reviewers, I used vanilla yogurt and strained it before using, so the sauce/dressing was fairly thick and adhered well to the fruit. Added fresh blueberries and raspberries to the fruit mix, fresh minced mint leaves to the sauce, and served in individual pineapple boats. A taste sensation and very pretty as well!

This is a wonderful recipe for a crowd. You can always buy ready-cut fruit to speed things along. To the reviewer who wanted a thicker dressing, I strained the yogurt through a cheesecloth for several hours in the fridge. This gives it the consistency of sour cream.

This is an easy and delicious fruit salad. I made this for Easter and can't wait to make it again when the fruit is more in season and juicy sweet. I don't care for papaya, so I substituted bananas (lots of little ones at Easter dinner), but didn't add them until just before service. I was asked for the recipe by everyone and there was little to take home!

What a wonderful dressing for fruit! I used strawberries in season, pineapple, mango, blueberries, banana, etc. and doubled the amount of fruit (had to feed 16 people). Don't double the amount of dressing, though - the recipe is sufficient!! I did add a few pinches of ground cardamom, because I like the taste. Don't use kiwi fruit - it is too tart with this dressing!

The dressing for this salad is wonderful. I will be using it again with various fruits.

The yogurt dressing complimented the fruit salad. I did not have all the fruit that were listed, added grapefruit, blackberry and raspberry to the mix. It is excellent and it has become a fridge staple at my house. The dressing is the key!!!!!!!!!!

This is an excellent fruit salad. I have made it for several gatherings and it's always popular. A note on the papaya in response to other comments- if you cut the papaya in half lengthwise you can scoop the seeds from the middle using a spoon. It should only take you a minute or so to do that and it's well worth it.

Used different fruit. Even my husband, who doesn't like fruit much, really liked it. I gobbled it up.

I made this fruit salad for my family after searching and searching for the perfect fruit dish to go with my dinner. Everything was great! Obviously, it contains A LOT OF FRUIT, and it could be reduced easily. We had leftovers for a while. I included the papaya, but it was a pain to de-seed (trust me, it has a TON OF SEEDS, and they may upset the texture of the dish!) It was more expensive than the other fruits as well. The papaya could easily be left out. The dish was very colorful and tasty. I plan to make this again!

I used different fruits. It worked out really well. Added more lime zest, like reviewers suggested. The only problem was that as you get towards the bottom of the bowl, you're left with little pieces of fruit swimming in liquid. But I guess that happens with any fruit salad. I'll make it again, but it's one of those dishes that doesn't bring much glory. People think 'hey, fruit salad is fruit salad,' and don't really pick up on your efforts to glaze it.

I used vanilla yogurt and the zest of two limes. I also used a bit more lime juice too. This is a recipe that doesn't need exact measurements. It had just the right amount of tartness and zest. A very nice, light sauce, as I served it in a small pitcher along with a big bowl of fruit salad. You don't need to combine.

Made this with peaches, blackberries, cantelope, strawberries and kiwi and it was a big hit. My husband even liked it and he hates fruit salad. The flavors were very mild but made a perfect compliment to the fruit.

The dressing is amazing!!! I used strawberries, green grapes, nectarines, cherries, and pineapple for the fruit and it was the best fruit salad I have ever had. Also, I used about 2/3 the recipe's lime juice, just start at 1/2 and add to taste, however, if you are using ripe or overripe fruit, definitely use all the lime juice as it might be too sweet otherwise. Don't skip the zest, it really adds aroma. The only critiscm I have is that the dressing could have been thicker, but it would be hard to do that without sacrificing flavor, any ideas?

Awesome dressing. I love the flavor it adds, and it actually adds, not overpowers. I love it especially on the strawberries. The 15 minute waiting time to let the flavors blend is essential.

Very good! I tried this recipe based on previous ratings. I left out the mango and added watermelon and kiwi- I might add a little more lime zest next time. A hit!

I rate very few recipes 4-forks, but this one deserves it! What an excellent combination of flavors. The dressing accents the fruit, but does not overpower it. Note: I added much less lime (even though I love "acid") and found it to be just right. I would recommend starting with half of the amount of lime juice then adding more to taste. Next time I will double the amount of lime zest--was tasty and added a nice color accent to the fruit.

I used less exotic fruits (just watermelon, pineapple grapes, kiwi, and strawberries) but who cares--you can put this dressing on anything! It was really refreshing and creative, and it couldn't be easier.

I didn't think that fruit salad could really be interesting, but this recipe was. The lime yogurt dressing was not gloppy and gooey as I feared, but was a tangy, subtle flavor that was d**n good!

Not bad. I added a few pinches of five-spice powder for some added flavor.
