Barely ok. I'd prefer a simple baked sweet potato this this!

This recipe is not worth the effort. The pealing and cutting is a lot of work. The result was fine but the potatoes were a little dry even after I poured juice on them while baking. I'd much rather just bake the sweet potatoes for an every day meal or buy frozen sweet potato fries. For a special meal, I would stick with the fancier mashed, pecaned affairs or other classics.

This was awful. Way to orangy. Going back to my old recipe roasting wedges and basting with grand marnier the last 10 mins.

Sorry, I found this one a bit lacking. The potatoes were a bit dry (and I turned them in their cooking juices more than once). I would suggest cooking the potatoes for about 5 minutes, draining and then tossing in the molasses mixture before baking. Still, a good combination of flavors.

These were tasty, but I didn't really notice the impact of the orange and molasses. I guess I was expecting a stronger taste from the sweet coating?

This was a great recipe - but it made a lot more than 8 servings (maybe my potatoes were too big). I had about 3 layers of wedges - filled up the 9 x 13. I covered with foil and baked for about 40 minutes and basted with the juices twice. I made it a couple of hours early and it reheated very well. Very yummy!

I made this recipe for Easter and it got rave reviews. The orange and molasses flavors are very clean and surprisingly complex. I would definitely make it again.

Made this for Thanksgiving and what a great addition. I followed the recipe exactly. Reheated it a day later and people raved! It's going to be a staple at our Thanksgiving dinner from now on.
