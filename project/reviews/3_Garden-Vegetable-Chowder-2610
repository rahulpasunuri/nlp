I added shredded chicken and mushrooms and a plethera of fresh herbs from the garden. Fresh and healthy. I'll make again.

I found this soup to be pretty bland. However, I would make it again, just adding a bit more salt and perhaps some jalepeno to spice it up a bit. The actual content of the soup was great and by adding some spice I think it would be wonderful.

I love this soup--It is a great food for winter, healthy with all that spinach and veggies, and the corn makes it sweet and creamy.

I've used this recipe for great, healthy comfort food during many a winter in Chicago and am looking forward to making it in California. I found it very easy to use whatever was available during the winter months and make it fun by blending as much or as little as I felt like. Also a wonderful soup to feed a sick friend/family member with.

I followed the recipe to the letter and was surprised to find it pretty bland in taste. Also, with the cooking times as stated, my veggies were pretty overcooked and kinda mushy. :-( Since I'm just learning how to cook, I was careful to follow the recipe but maybe I did something wrong though I don't know what!! I did add some lemon juice to my serving after tasting it initially and that made the flavours POP a little bit in my opinion.

Awesome soup!!! I did leave out the tyme and bay leaves and added my own seasoning, a hint a cayenne pepper is wonderful. Also, added a pint of fat-free cream to final step. Not just yummy, but beautiful too!

Not sure if I would make this again. Is it good? Yea, it's ok. It's good for a garden vegetable soup. I would have a hard time getting my family...who is used to our exceptional garden's produce to get excited about this soup.

My husband couldn't stop commenting on how good this soup was -- as he ate and ate and ate. I followed the recipe as is except I didn't have spinach on hand.

This was a nice, simple soup. I used canned corn instead of frozen and that worked fine. I also used new potatos instead of sweet potatos and that too was good. Finally, I didn't puree any of the soup and ate it as is. It was very good...

This soup is a great meal for a wintery supper. Make sure you tear spinach into small pieces before adding to soup. It will be easier to eat. It was delicious and good for you too.

Basically a good recipe. I recieved unsolicited compliments at a party where there was lots of great food. Go lighter on thyme than recipe calls for. I added a little dill to make the flavor a little more complex. Using real stock vs. canned broth would make this soup even better.

I loved this soup! I made it for company and mostly everyone loved it (4 out of 5 kids). I did not change a thing about the recipe, except I used plain sweet potatoes, because I couldn't find the red-skinned yams.

This soup was delicious and easy to make. A healthy, nutritious soup that looks very pretty upon presentation, too! Everyone loved it. I thought it was perfect as written. I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a delicious velvet-y textured soup. I accompanied it with chedder/stilton biscuits and it was a very satisfying light dinner. It even satisfied my carnivore brother.

This is an easy soup with a beautiful color. It definitely needed salt and pepper added, and I would use much less thyme next time -- the amount given is overpowering. I would definitely make it again. My 1-year old child also liked it a lot.
