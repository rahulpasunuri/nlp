These macarons are delicious. However, the dough is extremely sticky and I found it impossible to pipe it so I used a spoon instead. I tried to smooth them out completely with a wet finger but they still did not look nearly as perfect as the ones I see at the bakery. I did not bother with the coating because I thought it would be superfluous and they seem more authentic without it. I also baked them a little longer than the recipe called for. This might not be necessary as the macarons at the bakery never look browned at all either. Making them the dimensions suggested in the recipe yielded fewer cookies. I used an ungreased Silpat liner on a cookie sheet and the macarons did not stick.

The cookies came out flat and I had to burn my fingers in order to dip each one in the chocolate. The dipping chocolate didn't melt very well, I suspect because of the shortening. They taste pretty good but aren't that pretty.

This is the second year that I am making this recipie for my Xmas givaway. The macaroons alone are wonderful and perhaps for someone who can't tolerate rich food this would be enough. The entire package is VERY rich but absolutely wonderful, a keeper.

Oh, wow. This was magnificent. I live in Japan and couldn't get my hands on any hazelnuts, but I had a hunch that pistachios would be good in this. I was right! I also left out the coffee, as my husband does not like the flavor. Other than that, I followed this recipe faithfully. They turned out perfectly! It made 34 wonderfully delicious cookies. These are basically macaroons with a truffle mounded on top. If you decide to use pistachios, make sure that you rinse the salt off of them after shelling. I took these to a cookie exchange tonight, and they disappeared in minutes. Men and women alike raved about them and demanded the recipe. They do require a little time and effort, but they are totally worth the trouble!

The first time I made the recipe, I didn't have any vanilla extract, so instead substituted an equal amount of almond extract, and the cookies (sans ganache and topping) were fantastic. Although the entire recipe is good, I would suggest for people short on time -- or just looking for a different kind of cookie to make -- making only the cookies without the rest of it. They're delicious! Also -- baking time was a little bit longer than 12 min. -- more like 16-18 min.

My macaroons are coming out as flat disks -- can anyone suggest how to fix this? I've tried to make it several times, varying the mixture. The disks taste fine, but they're not really suitable for the rest of the recipe.

I don't understand how this recipe can make 30 as I doubled the recipe and I still managed to make only 24 macaroons. I lined my baking sheets with rice paper so I didn't have to bother with peeling the cookies off the greaseproof paper. I didn't bother with the frills of the ganache and chocolate topping, they were great as they were. I gave them away as presents and received rave reviews. Might try the ganache when I next have the time.

I purchased BonAppetit Classic Desserts back in Dec of 1991. I compiled a recipe book from this issue because there were so many luscious recipes!! This is an absolutely superb cookie. My sister is on the order of "Martha Stewart", so you can imagine how nice it felt to have her ask me for the recipe! Well, here it is Sis - HAPPY BAKING!! I've been making this cookie for the past 8 Christmas's. I'd say it ranks as one of the top 5 I make every year. This year I had 21 different varities for my Christmas gifts. When I make the macaroons I multiply the recipe by 4. My only revision to the recipe is that I Adjusted the oven temp to 300 F. I only bake the cookies for 7 min. I don't use pastry bag, I simply drop dough unto foil with a spoon. I also don't find it necessary to flatten cookies before baking. I use foil on cookie sheet instead of parchment. Make sure cookies are completely cooled before attempting to remave from foil. Macaroons can be made in advance and stored in air-tight container in a cool place or under refrigeration. I suggest applying ganache only 2 or 3 days before dipping cookies in chocolate coating a day or so before serving. I always top mine off with hazelnuts I have put through food processer with a whole toasted hazelnut in the center. I prefer that to the raspberry because raspberry in a gift box would be very fragile. This is definitely a 4-star delight!!!!!
