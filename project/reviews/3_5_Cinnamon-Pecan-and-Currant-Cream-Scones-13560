they were ok, but the dried blueberry meyer lemon scones on this site are so much better in flavor and texture. I wonder if anybody has tried leaving the egg out on this recipe?? It seems to be the only difference between the two recipes......

This was the first time I made scones, and they turned out GREAT. Easy and delicious, just as written.

Can wait to bake these scones and have for breakfast with a nice hot cup of coffee. I made these scones last week http://imunchie.com/thisheartdreams/munchies/cinnamon-chip-scones

These were very yummy!!!! Made about 12 smaller sized scones.

Yum! I don't know what happened when other reviewers made the dough, but I thought it was easy to work with for a biscuit or scone recipe. I also subbed milk for heavy cream and left out the fruit and nuts (kids don't like them.) I sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar. My whole family devoured them! This recipe seemed very versatile. I'll be making this my goto recipe for all variations of scones.

These were great! Better than some I've had bakeries. I used whole milk instead of the cream. After adding all the ingredients, I added a tablespoon of water because it wasn't coming together very well. It was a pretty annoying kneading the dough as it was so sticky and i had to keep adding flour. I used about a tablespoon of sugar to sprinkle the scones and was definitely glad I did. So yummy! loved them!

Oh, these were really good. I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour to make it a little healthier, and I really liked the texture. I also used half pecans and half almonds bc I didn't have enough pecans. The crunch really made it fun to eat. I didn't have any cream, so I had to use regular milk. Instead of brushing it with cream before baking, I brushed it with the egg white from earlier. yummy!!

My favorite scone recipe so far. I love the buttery, flaky center and the crusty outside. Try the conversions suggested at http://www.joyofbaking.com/IngredientSubstitution.html for the self-rising flour. I made this substitution successfully. Also, I've doubled the recipe twice and it works great (single recipe only makes 6 - why not get more for your effort!)

I used milk instead of cream and raisins instead of currents. Nothing tricky there, just what I had handy. These substitutions had no real impact on taste, the proportions are perfect. I think there is plenty of sugar in the dough, so I didn't sprinkle any additional sugar on top. I did use the egg white from the egg yolk to add a little glaze. A really nice recipe, a perfectly moist, chewy scone. I have big plans for this recipe: bacon and cheddar, dried pineapples and macadamia nuts, and so on!

Reading the reviews I must add, it did take a little more mixing than I expected to get this dough to pull together. The moisture didn`t seem like enough, though in the end, it did very nicely.

These were light, fluffy and delicious. I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, reduced the sugar by 1/3, and used raisin in the stead of currants, as per what was on hand. I didn't find this batter too sticky or hard to handle, it easily turned out as well was kneaded and shaped easily. I prefer savoury scones to sweet and used this recipe as a base for ham, parm. and chive scones. I omitted the cinnamon, currants, sugar and pecans; (to a double recipe) I added 1 tbsp ground black pepper, a couple shakes garlic powder, a dash tabasco, 3 tbsp dried chives, a quarter (of one med.) fine grated onion, 1/3c small diced ham and 1/4c parm. These turned out fluffy, flaky, well seasoned and delicious. I will use this as a base for any scones I make in the future.

The final result was sooooo delicious. I gave this three forks though because of the consistency of the batter. There was NO WAY this was getting kneaded and molded into any sort of round - it was INCREDIBLY sticky, even with an over-floured surface. I just formed them into small disks myself. I did toast the pecans first and tripled the amount of cinnamon. Really yummy, but again, the batter was really difficult to work with.

Nice scone recipe. I read that some people found the dough too crumbly. I definitely found that I had to mix the dough quite a bite before it absorbed all the moisture from the liquid ingredients. But once it was thoroughly mixed and softened up a bit in my hands, it was very easy to work with. I shaped the scones by hand, one handful at a time--made 6 in all. I also put in an extra tablespoon of sugar. Great recipe. Good for varying as well; next time I'll use chocolate chips and walnuts instead.

I thought this recipe was tasty and easy to make. The dried currants that I bought were very hard so I soaked them in a bit of water before adding them to the dough. That way the currants didn't take moisture away from the scones and it didn't negatively affect the outcome. I will definitely make these again soon.

Never got a "sticky but manageable" dough. I think it needs more butter and maybe a touch more cream. It needs MAJOR tweaking for a next time... if I try it again. I know I didn't over measure the flour as I weigh it each time I cook. Dough was VERY dry and the scones were even drier. I can only imagine how DRY they would have been had I not pre-soaked the currants! I'm looking for a new recipe.

First time making scones and they were deeelicious! Like the previous reviwers, I quadrupled the cinnamon (2tsp) and toasted the nuts. Excellent!

great recipe, the pecans really make it. Next time a double batch!

Don't know if I did something wrong, but these were crumbly, light, and unimpressive. They weren't bad, but really not worth making, as there are much better recipes out there.

These scones are as light as "lad's love". Best scones I've made.

This scone is lovely. It's beautiful to look at and the crumb is lovely. I baked for 15 minutes and it didn't dry out. I mixed the leftover egg white with a little heavy cream for the top glaze. (Heavy cream on its own doesn't produce a pretty sheen.)

...make sure that you toast the pecans first; definitely enhances the flavor. We did not have currents- used dried cherries and raisons with good effect.

I really liked these scones...but made a lot of changes: used half cornmeal, half whole-wheat flour; QUADRUPLED the cinnamon; added a little bit of orange zest (might do without next time). With these changes, I thought the scone was delicious! Not too sweet, and with good consistency and interesting flavor. Definitely don't be afraid to up the cinnamon...that's what makes it!

I made this for my bridge group and they loved it. In fact, two asked for the recipe. I made it with half and half instead of cream.

Maybe I cooked the scones too long - they came out dry. Taste was fine, but they were hard to eat without something to wash them down. I prefer the ginger scones recipe on this site.

This is a great scone recipe. I didn't find it dry at all, but I did brush a lot of cream on the pre-cooked scones. Definitely worth making a double batch!

i used light cream and splenda sugar substitute (but regular white sugar for sprinkling on top) and they came out great. they had a delicate texture, without being too dry. would definitely make again.

excellent recipe. I have made it twice and my 11yo son made it once because he wanted some so badly. Easy to make and eat! We did sub. the currents with dried cranberries, because that is what we like best.

I love this recipe. It's delicious with an evening cup of tea and a good conversation. The only thing I do differently is leave the scones in the pan while they bake. I find that they retain more moisture that way.

i really really love these - the cinnamon and currants are terrific in this scone. this recipe is a keeper.

Rating: 3
Wonderful! The only changes I made were that I mixed the dough in the food processor (much easier), and I sprinkled just a little crystalline sugar on top of them. This gives just a tiny burst of sweetness when you bite into the scone.

A friend of mine made this recipe and e-mailed it to me from your website. I have made it several times and each time the scones are light and tasty. I like the hint of cinnamon and how the taste improves with each chew. I use exactly 1/4th teaspoon of salt. A few grains more can make it too salty. I also add a few more drops of cream to give a better hand to the dough when necessary.

I just tried this tonight, and it was really great! I substituted almonds and chopped golden raisins for the pecans and currants (not because I don't like them, just to use what was on hand), and the combination was nice. Hubby thought they tasted a little salty, though -- maybe because I didn't have unsalted butter and used just regular butter. They have a nice scone texture and were great with a cup of cinnamon tea!

Have made this twice. Second time I made it I used dried cranberries instead of currants and was delicious. Also used walnuts instead of pecans. So different and goes well with brunch.

I loved this recipe and received compliments as well. I subsituted dates for the currants and have made them twice. Next time I plan to sprinkle top with cinnamon sugar!

I'm a cinnamon-lover. This recipe is wimpy on the cinnamon - not that tasty. Maybe with some finagling, I'll like it better.

Not sure why, but these didn't turn out great. They were ok but not nearly as good as other scones I've made (like the Ginger ones on this website). I tasted too much baking powder and the texture didn't taste rich.

I wanted a scone that rose and was crumbly, this scone is not. It looks more like a cookie. The flavor is great. I would make this recipe again for the family. They loved the cinnamon and pecans.

A delicious and light scone recipe! I added another teaspoon of sugar and another 1 teaspoon of cream so the dough was easier to work. I substituted raisins for the currants.

These are sooo good, they taste like bakery scones. I doubled the recipe and put raisins and pecans in half (didn't have currants on hand)and just pecans in the other half. Served them to company for brunch along with spinach quiche, sausage, and fresh fruit. They were a huge hit, a definite keeper.
