Made this for a birthday dinner party. It was delicious. I didn't do much different. Like another reviewer, I limited the number of vegetables in the salad. I eliminated the squash and the eggplant (which also makes the salad easier to prepare). Great summer dinner party dish!

Grilling or broiling works well for this recipe. I have tried both and have used the vinaigrette time and again over a variety of fish such as red snapper and tilapia. Everyone loves it!

Wonderful way to cook seafood. I propose some changes though. Please help teach readers to appreciate the whole lobster. The body of the lobster has very delicate and sweet bits and an essence that's wonderful. At least use it in a pasta recipe including the shell for seasoning. Another change I'd recommend is to keep the shells on the shrimp while they are grilled, to retain the moisture and actually adds a wonderful smokey flavor. The shells can be discarded after grilling. Finally, the bulgar salad has too many vegetables in it. Keep it simple because the seafood has such a wonderful flavor. Bits of vegetable are nice but as it is, there are too many strong flavors. But a great mix to have the grilled seafood with bulgar and vinegrette anyway.
