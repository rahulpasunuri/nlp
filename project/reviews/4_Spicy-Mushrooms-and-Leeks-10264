This is a fantastic side dish that goes extremely well with roasted meats. Has a tiny punch with the red pepper and nice piquant flavor of the lemon can cut meat richness. I love this recipe and make it all the time after a friend of mine found it and made it for me once. Simply gorgeous.

Good -- tastes much better than it looks! And the microwave certainly makes it easy.

this is super good!!! I sauted ingredients rather than using the zapper. Added a bit of garlic and some julienned zucchini. It is great either way and very quick and simple.
