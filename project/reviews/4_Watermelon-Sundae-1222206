It's going to be hard for me to make ice cream without ricotta from this point on, great flavor and texture, watermelon worked better than I would have thought, but I didn't think the chocolate brought anything to the table.

This is a fabulous and very different ice cream -- easy to make. I didn't have watermelon, but served it with a cassis sauce. It would also be good with fresh Maine blueberries!

Just had to comment on this one. Delicious and so quick! It has the body of a custard ice cream - rich and creamy - without the work. It came together in five minutes. I was skeptical about the watermelon pairing, but it was inspired. They work together beautifully for an extremely refreshing dessert. The ricotta does give a slight graininess to the ice cream, which I didn't mind but some might.
