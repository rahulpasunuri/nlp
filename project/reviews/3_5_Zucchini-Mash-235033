I love this recipe. It actually looks quite unappetizing when it is done but it is delicious. I like spicey food so I add a jalapeno and I sautee the pepper and garlic in a harissa olive oil. I don't usually use butter (it doesn't need it) and I tyipically leave off the green onions as I don't usually have them in the fridge. End result is something very healthy and flavorful.

I found this recipe after I accidentally "overbought" zucchini this week. Based on other reviews I used one finely chopped red pepper, halved the butter and eliminated the olive oil. I served this over farro as a vegetarian meal and everyone loved it! One child complained that it had too much pepper (I used 4 twists of the grinder, which was much less than the 1/2 teaspoon called for) but overall a big hit. I mixed everything (including the scallions) with the immersion blender at the end and it came out smooth and delicious. Definitely a keeper!

Success! I incorporated all the best suggestions from previous reviewers and the dish came out appealing looking and delicious! I used red bell pepper instead of green; 1 Tbsp. olive oil instead of 2; 1 Tbsp. of butter at the beginning but didn't add it at the end; sprinkled the zucchini mixture with 2 tsp. vegetable bouillion powder (which gave it a gorgeous color); used 1/4 tsp. black pepper instead of 1/2; cooked it 15 minutes and then drained off all the liquid; then blended it in the food processor, adding 2 Tbsp. non-fat plain yogurt. Wow, wow, wow!

Yum! Took out the bell pepper because I hate them. The results were awesome. I'm sure I will make it again and again and again.

Have faced with one dilemma. Accurately cooked zucks contain a lot of water so you need to dry it somehow or make it more "thick". Another way is to simmer it for at least 20 minutes or so, but zucks will become overcooked and lost all its taste. I tried to pour out all the liquid and keep heating when mashing. Also taste is more tender is you replace a half of the butter with sour cream to exploit wide-spread idea of zucchini cream soups. Interesting idea and useful base, but still in need of improvement in serving. Also maybe a part of asain salads. Its slightly bitter taste works good with toasts, soft cheese and fresh grilled fish.

good enough for the gardener with too many zukes, but not good enough to buy them for.

Very good - I didn't have scallions or a bell pepper so I finely chopped an onion and sauteed it. I did have to drain off some of the liquid (seemed the more I cooked it the more water came out of the squash). Not the prettiest of dishes but very tasty. Will make again

I let this simmer (uncovered) for nearly 15 min - not much additional 'mashing' required. I used just a teaspoon of butter (on the pepper) and no oil, and the dish was still 'buttery'. I would use pepper next time, but probably only half as much - the flavor was a little too strong

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but my husband and I having been looking for starch alternatives. He absolutely loved it! I thought it was good, but it's certainly not a pretty dish. Served it with the GRILLED MAHI MAHI WITH BLOOD ORANGE, AVACADO, AND LIME SALSA.

Great recipe, very flavorful. Three forks vs four only because the presentation wasn't a 4 fork. I followed the directions only substituting onions for the scallions and added parmesean cheese as another reviewer suggested. Great way to use zucchini.

I love any recipe that encourages a starch alternative with a vegetable substitute. Healthier, lighter and refreshingly different from your usual mashed potatoes. Its a little bland so I think next time around Ill roast the garlic before adding it and maybe also add some eggplant to the mash for a denser consistency. I say skip the butter and add a little parmesan cheese to top it at the end. Again, a healthier alternative that Im all for.

fabulous and easy! made recipe without the green pepper, and used a food processor to blend to a smooth, creamy consistency. great low-carb alternative to potatoes. must be tasted to be believed.

This is a simple and tasty way to serve up zucchini. Don't make this without the pepper though, it does really add a lot of taste.

This was very good! Nice recipe to add something different to a week night meal.

You need to cook this a little longer than the recipe suggests for best texture. I also added a tablespoon of chicken base -- transforms the dish. My bf likes it on water crackers. Don't leave out the bell pepper as it makes the dish.

This recipe was a great jumping off point in terms of creativity for me...try with eggplant instead of zuchinni and shallots instead of scallions...it was really wonderful, i paired it with fish

a) it took much longer to simmer away the liquid; b) i didn't hold out much hope while this was cooking & expected I'd have to add parmesan or something. But I was really surprised with the end result -- thought it was really flavorful & delicious. One other thing, I used about three whole scallions, not just the greens.

Very good and healthy (I cut the amount of butter in half). I don't care for green peppers so left them out of the recipe. I'll make this again--DH loved it and didn't know it was good for him!

I misread my shopping list and bought red bell pepper instead of green, and by the time I realized my mistake, I couldn't do anything about it, so I left it out. I think I'll continue doing this in the future! The zucchini by itself has amazing texture and flavour, and by not starting out sauteeing pepper, I eliminated nearly all of the fat of the dish! The colours of the scallion greens with the two-toned zucchini were beautiful too... definitely going on plates where mashed potatoes used to!

Some reviewers said this dish was a little watery. You have to follow the recipe exactly as written and cook out almost all of the liquid; then it will be great! I've made this several times, and even drain it at the end before mashing to make sure the liquid is gone. As with most recipes, I find that cutting the oil and butter quantity in half still tastes delicious and elminates a lot of fat and calories! I also like it best with red bell pepper. A very nice new twist on plain old zucchini.

Total hit at the summer bbq. Have made it twice since. My hubby and I love it, although I make it with less Zuchini since its just the 2 of us.

This dish was a hit at a recent "carry-in" dinner. I decided to use salted butter instead of un-salted butter.

I'm with Ithaca, below. Unimpressive and a little on the bland side. I probably won't toss the leftovers, but will drain them (thoroughly!) and toss them into spaghetti sauce.

I've got to disagree with the crowd here... This just didn't taste very good to me, and in fact leftovers of it sat in our fridge uneaten for about a before we finally threw them away. Not to mention that it never really mashed, so I think the title is something of a misnomer.

First time making the dish and it really is an easy no fail, quick recipe that recieved high compliments. I bought small zucchini and backed off from adding a few extra when in the end I wished I did. The liquid at the end of the cooking process took a while to cook in and the final product was extra buttery with no need to add the extra butter. Suggestion - don't shy away from adding a few extra zucchini especially if they are small. I topped a scoop of this with a stuffed pepper and enjoyed the way it looked and tasted.

Really, really good. Don't stray from the recipe (except I like another reviewer's choice of red pepper rather than green). I mounded the mash and placed a grilled chicken breast on top with roasted veggies on top of that. Everyone loved it as an alternative to mashed potatoes. The flavors blend beautifully and leave you wanting more. Healthy, tasty, different -- a great summer side.

Very very good. The addition of scallions at the end was surprising. Note: the zucchini really cooks down so make a lot!

Used a red pepper instead of green and cut the zucchini in 1/2 slices. Served it along side tilapia, and unfortunately folks went back for seconds of the mash - i was looking forward to the leftovers.
