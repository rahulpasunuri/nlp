This wasn't very pizza-like--more of a creamy frittata or flan-like texture. I used a large cast-iron skillet and poured all the batter in at once. The batter was much better- behaved than I expected. It didn't stick or burn on the bottom, cooked right through and developed a lovely, crisp brown top under the broiler. It was delicious with a simple roasted corn and fresh tomato salad. I'm a vegetarian, and I will definitely add this to the regular rotation.

This was good, but it would have been better with some garlic. It was a bit bland. I cooked in a non-stick skillet, slid onto a cookie sheet and then broiled. Stayed together great.

I made this for a friend with a gluten allergy, and it was a hit! It's definitely going into the regular rotation.

The directions aren't specific enough to allow you to make a success of this recipe the first time (unless you've actually seen it made), but it is so delicious it's worth trying 30 or 40 times until you get it right. So learn from my mistakes: first, use a 12 inch skillet or it won't cook through before it burns on the bottom. Heat the skillet well before adding the spray and the oil. Even though I used a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, both crepes still stuck. Use moderate heat, not moderate to high heat as called for in the recipe so that cooking is slower and more even. I broiled at 550 F on the top rack. Next time, I'd move the rack down one slot and broil at 500. I'd also use more oil on the bottom and less on top. You could also just brown the bottom, then bake it for a while before broiling. Mine did not slide off the pan easily onto a platter. Both of them fell apart so that they looked like scrambled eggs. Nonetheless, I did not care because the crepes were absolutely delicious. In fact, they make a lovely meal for 2.
