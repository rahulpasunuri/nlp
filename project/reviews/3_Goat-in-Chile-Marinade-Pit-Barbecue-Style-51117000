This dish was a hit at my Halloween dinner party. I used two goat legs that weighed a total of 8lbs. Didn't have guajillo chiles so I substituted seeded jalapeno chiles instead. Marinated for 48 hours. I cooked at 250 degrees as I felt 325 was too high. Cooked in a roasting pan covered with three layers of foil for 8.5 hours and it was awesome. Perfectly succulent. It's important to keep the foil tightly sealed to prevent moisture from escaping and the goat drying out. Resist the temptation to peak while it's cooking.

To the cook from the UK, there is no real substitute, but when I am out of avocado leaves I use bay leaves with a few anise seeds.

Sounds delicious. Can fresh avacado or banana leaves be used? Any suggestions on how to build/construct a pit- barbecue? Thanks in advance.

I've never cooked with avocado leaves, either, but according to http://www.foodsubs.com/HerbsHisp.html, you have options: avocado leaves = hoja de aguacate Notes: Mexican cooks use these to impart an anise-like aroma to foods. They're often used as wrappers, or crumbled into stews. Toast the leaves before using. Substitutes: banana leaves (as a wrapper) OR hoja santa OR fennel (if chopped leaves are called for) OR maguey leaves (as a wrapper)

Any suggestions for a substitute for avocado leaves as I can't get them here?
