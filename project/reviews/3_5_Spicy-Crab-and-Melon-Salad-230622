Wonderful, flavorful dish which has gotten lots of compliments. Also served it in a roll which was very good too.

Quite tasty and easy to make. I was out of old bay and substituted a mildy curry which was also tasty with the fresh taragon.

As you can guess, this takes just minutes to prepare, doesn't require any cooking, and is great on a hot day.
