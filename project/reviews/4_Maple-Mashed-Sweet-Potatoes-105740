Silky smooth with a hint of maple flavor without overpowering the dish or the meal for that matter. Just what a side should be. Very nice compliment to turkey or pork. Good staple to have in your repertoire of recipes. Used grade B maple syrup.

Finally found a keeper for Thanksgiving sweet potatoes! I, like other cooks, reduced the butter by almost half and doubled the maple syrup. It was delicious.

Delicious - I make this recipe and the add the gingersnap-pecan-brown sugar topping from the sweet potato pudding recipe and bake for 1/2 hour or so till the topping is caramelized and yummy - it's more like a sweet potato pie but I have yet to hear a complaint!

Loved this recipe. So easy. Used cubed sweet potatoes from Trader Joe's. Worked like a charm.

I love the simplicity of this dish! I've been making it for years and look forward to it every holiday. I can see why people might feel it needs something. But you see, its pillowy buttery consistency and its barely there sweetness is what makes this dish so delicious for us at home! For me it is a perfect compliment to everything else that is going on the Thanksgiving menu.

I've made this every year for Thanksgiving since this issue of Gourmet came out in 2001. My family looks forward to it and if it weren't there I'm sure I would be flogged. The only thing I do different is add a tad more maple syrup. I'm finally going through all these old Gourmets and throwing them out. It's was a good run.

I've used this recipe several times. I am not a big fan of Sweet Potatoes, but I love these. I used salted instead of unsalted butter and extra maple syrup. These are always a hit in my house!

I have a small infant and needed to find a dish that didn't require too much time and effort and of course, I wanted it to be delicious... I made this recipe for Thanksgiving at the in-laws. It was easy and tasted wonderful!

I thought these were tasty as is, but added a touch more maple syrup, a sprinkle of nutmeg and salt to taste for an even better result.

This was okay. I agree with other reviewers that it nees something.

Very easy to prepare. These are wonderful- very, very rich, but wonderful. I like the fact that you can prepare them ahead of time and, even if microwaved (gasp- the horror!), they are still delish. Perfect side dish if you only have one oven in your home and it is busy with the Thanksgiving turkey.

Tasty, but needed a little something.... Next time, I'd use light cream, maybe a little butter, and a little more maple syrup.

The flesh of the potatoes was so soft that a fork was all that was necessary for mashing. I agreed with the reviewers who said that more maple syrup and additional salt was necessary. This recipe met my requirements for a "four fork" rating - delicious, easy to make, and can be made in advance!

The potato flesh was so soft that I just mashed them with a fork. As suggested by previous reviewers, I added additional maple syrup and more salt. This recipe meets my 3 requirements for a "four fork" rating - easy, tasty, and the ability to make it in advance!

This is the third year I've made this for Thanksgiving. Yummy as is, easy to make ahead and reheat. I stir in a few tablespoons of Grand Marnier... wunderbar!

Excellent. I took the advice from a previous review and added nutmeg, but also tried a little cinnamon ...Yummy.

This is very good and pretty easy to make. It was the side dish with the largest success at this year's Thanksgiving dinner. Carving the sweet potatos is always a little messy but the result is worth it!

I;m with the person who suggested a little nutmeg and cayenne pepper. I read the reviews before I made it so had that in mind. While this dish is very easy, and much better than canned sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top, I too thought it needed a little something, so added a couple dashes of nutmeg and cayenne pepper. Very subtle, but made it a little better.

I love baked sweet potatoes just as they are,and dislike the 'candied' versions, so this recipe was just right for the crew at Thanksgiving...it is delicious and just special enough for those who do love a good sweet potato. I know I will make this over and over..Here I am the day before with this scrumptious dish in front of me...I will be lucky to have it left for tomorrow's festivities!

I whipped the potatoes with a hand mixer and loved the results. Very fluffy, great taste, very easy preparation. I made them a day ahead and reheated in the oven.

This recipe is very easy but when made as is the flavor is a bit simplistic. I ended up adding some cayenne for spice and ginger for complexity (also a bit more cream than called for in the recipe). It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!

This has become a staple for me. The roasting of the Sweet potatoes is the key. Adds a much deeper flavor-Nutty sweet rather than sugar sweet. Low Fat Milk and less butter has only a marginal effect on the quality of the dish and brings the fat content way down.

Made this for friends the other night and experimented -- the recipe was very versatile! Added chopped, toasted pecans and 1/4 cup of brandy, and used only 1/2 the butter called for. Everyone raved about the results!

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful side dish! A couple modifications were needed, however as others suggested. More maple syrup and more salt. I have made this twice, both with about 2lbs of potatoes and used more than 2 tbl of maple syrup both times. Also, continue to salt to taste b/c the salt is what balances the maple and makes this better than a candied potato dish. Oh, and less butter.

Very easy and a big hit! Am making it for the second time in two weeks.

People at Thanksgiving dinner would NOT stop raving about the sweet potatoes! I pureed the you-know-what out of them for a very soft, fluffy consistency...the subtle flavor of maple was nice. I heard about these potatoes for DAYS after Thanksgiving... A welcome change from the ol' candied with marshmallows on top.

A big hit on my Thanksgiving table, however I doubled the amount of maple syrup, which gave it a very maple (rather than subtle) flavor.

Rating: 4
This was very good...the flavor of the maple syrup was just right. I did not use heavy cream but Dean's "light cream" which is 18% milkfat. It was plenty rich. I also added more salt to taste...I am making it for Thanksgiving this year and will not use canned yams anytime soon!

I have to agree with the fellow New Jerseyans...don't puree, watch the cream and use more salt!! I also cooked the potatos on the stove and it worked great. I will definitely make these again ~ they taste great, easy to make and looked great on the plate. Very colorful. I'm sure these will be on the menu for Thanksgiving!

I want to say that I love the recipe and I think that basically it is ok. Just a few tips. Do NOT puree this! It will come out like baby food. You want the tartness of some lumps of potato and the sweetness of the smoother parts. Also, ease up on the cream and use salted butter. This takes a LOT of salt to make it just right, and the salted butter helps with that. Other than those tips this is a good recipe.

My family loved this recipe (even my husband who doesn't usually like sweet potatoes). It is a classic, simple, flavorful recipe. This is now on the "must" list for Thanksgiving dinner.

Very Good. Like others, I added more maple syrup, less cream (it was getting to runny)Cooked potatoes in water over the stove, faster than roasting and made day before. Reheated beautifully

I love this recipe. I forgot the pepper. I made the potatoes a day in advance. On the day I served it I soaked golden raisans in syrup and put on top for the last 5-10 minutes of baking. It as wonderful. It is best to use a pure maple syrup.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I did not add butter, and added more maple syrup. Also served it with a drizzle of syrup over the top for presentation. Very easy to prepare before hand.

Now I think I understand why I'm the first to rate this recipe. If I'd done further research, I would have made the Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Maple Syrup, also on this site. As it was, the dish turned out very well, but only because I used one-third of the weight in sweet potatoes; of course, proportionaly less of the other ingredients, except for the maple syrup. Two tablespoons of maple syrup could hardly make a statement in 6 lbs. of sweet potatoes. I could barely get a taste of maple syrup in my 2 lbs. Having said all that, it still was a very tasty dish, and to the alternate recipe mentioned, I would add a touch of heavy cream as called for in the current recipe.
