Another native Balimorean stepping up to say this recipe is beyond horrid. You have to steam crabs - in beer... layer of crabs, layer of old bay seasoning, layer of crabs, layer of old bay... etc... anything else is a waste of good blue crabs.

This was a good taste, and will go well with a full AsianFare menu. Alone it wasnt very impressive but with some other items it was a great addition. Wasabisauce was very good and wil be great with some other seafood as well. These were as good boied as per the recipe and i stteamed some as well and they were good too. So right way or wrong way to cook a blue crab is ultimately up to the Chef i believe. and if no one dies that is a bonus. Good Cooking to all

Asian food is a favorite, and this is a good sauce. But!! The recipe as a whole was not very attention grabbing even with the great Wasabi. This will be good served with some other Thai or Asian fare. Alone not a high score with other dishes nice addition.

I grew up on the eastern shore and Baltimore needs to and some variety to that Old Bay spice

Although the delivery may have been harsh, ultimately the reviewer from Baltimore is correct. Boiling crab in this manner (especially blue crab, because of it's delicate meat) destroys the meat because you are circulating super heated water around the small claws and relatively thin shells. Result - Mush. Steam is a far gentler way of cooking almost all shell fish. Ever notice how a lobster that has been boiled has great tail meat but really mushy claw meat? As to the debate about using only Old Bay to season, I say use what you like. Old Bay started in the Chesapeake some sixty years ago and just sort of became the "norm". By the way, I grew up on the Eastern shores of Maryland and spent most of my summers on Chincoteague Island and the like. Ask any watermen out there and they would tell you to NEVER boil a crab. Actually, they would say "If you want really superior crab, dig a pit in your back yard..."

Since the reviews are already screwed with NOT ONE valid review of this recipe, I just thought I'd chime in and concur with everyone's opinion EXCEPT the Baltimore elitist. Yowza, get a life. Pronto.

I don't think that the cook from Baltimore knows what he/she is talking about. I grew up eating boiled blue shell crabs, and they are very good.

As someone who lives in crab country( S La.), correct boiling is imo superior to steaming. But, to each his own. I've also had great dry stir-fried crabs. Not fair to denigrate.

Baltimore offers a parochial and unhelpful review. First, Old Bay seasoning is a bizarrely flavorless mid-atlantic state oddity. Second, why do you read Epicurious if you aren't interested in variety, or in new recipes? Go away and eat your boring Old Bay steamed crab someplace else, please. [I apologize for also contributing an unhelpful review - I can't eat crab, so I can't comment].

Anyone who boils crabs is showing their ignorance to anyone who has every had a correctly steamed crab. It's an absurd way to waste a crab. Crabs should always, always be steamed with plenty of Old Bay style seasoning.
