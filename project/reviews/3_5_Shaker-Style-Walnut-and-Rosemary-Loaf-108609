I've made this many times, and like to substitute almonds on occasion as well. Very impressive as a gift to a hostess.

Excellent! Moist and nutty. Made in breadmaker, so only made half the recipe.

My first foray into yeast bread was a big success! Moist and tender with a nice crust. Needs a little more rosemary for my taste. Also, I used one part light whole wheat flour to 2 parts bread flour. Had to knead it forever (so I'll be getting a machine for that!), but it was worth it this time. Will make this one again!

Very lovely and tasty bread. I froze the second loaf and after four months it tasted as good as when newly baked.
