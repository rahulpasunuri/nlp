I made the recipe exactly as the directions stated and this turned out great! The only change I made was that I used 4-1cup custard cups rather than 6-3/4 cup custard cups. I opted not to use the raspberry liquor. I can't imagine how it would add that much to the dish. I made this for my very picky husband for his birthday and he said "I love it!". This recipe equals or perhaps surpasses that of restaurant creme brulees I have had. I will be making this again!

Made for dinner party. Guests said best dessert ever! Guests who do not like creme brulee scraped the dish. Used egg to sugar ratio as recipe indicates - sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of regular sugar and broiled to yummy perfection! Served with mixed berries, no liquer. Simply wonderful.

This recipe tastes great, but i can't ever get the broiling right. I now use a flambe kit from dessertsnow.com & it comes out perfect every time. No torching & great aromas

People complemnted that it was the best creme brulee they had ever had, even at french restraunts. It was exceptional!

Very good basic creme brulee! Easy and straightforward. I tried the 8 egg yols and 2 c cream, and actually found it a bit HEAVY, though. We all ate it with great gusto (my daughter requested this instead of birthday cake) so I would be happy to reuse this recipe, but I think I might try it with a different egg:cream ratio next time.

Very good recipe. Although on my first attempt I turned the brûlé to a flambé. Once I scraped the charcoal off it was quite delicious. A must try for everyone.

Even using 6 yolks instead of the recommended 9 this recipe came out eggy. Will be retrying with less sugar and three egg yolks.

A favorite in our home. A lovely straight-ahead creme brulee, gorgeously simplistic. I have made the much creamier version that many suggest, but have also stuck to the recipe here, and we love them both. It does only make 5 servings so take that into consideration.

I loved this recipe! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used 8 yolks and 3 cups of cream. The consistency was excellent in my opinion because it was thicker than most creme brules i´ve tried, and i prefer it that way. The only thing was that the amount in the recipe was for 5 servings not 6 as stated, but you could use smaller ramekins. Wonderful!

Superb! My guests loved every bit of it and craved for more. A definite keeper. I used 8 yolks and 3 Cups of cream, and it was perfect.

I agree with the other reviewers...the ratio of egg yolks to cream is off. I tried it with 8 yolks and 2 c. cream, and found the flavor very good and the texture a bit light. However, the dinner guests had never had this dish at all, and really liked it. Definitely use a real vanilla bean!

Very tasty-especially with summer picked fruit

Way too eggy. I agree that the ratio of egg to cream needs to be modified. Please don't deny yourself the pleasure of torching the top sugar layer.

Loved this recipe, unbelievably easy... I used a about a tsp. of jam in the bottom of each ramekin. I also used a torch rather than a broiler to caramelize the sugar-- and conducted a quick science project. I tried out light brown sugar, turbinado (raw) sugar, and regular white sugar. The winner in a landslide is WHITE sugar. Brown burns badly and puffs, turbinado is too chunky and doesn't easily melt... white made lovely crisp caramel topping without burning.

I made this recipe last Christmas and was told that I could not come this year if I did not bring it again!!

9 yolks for 1 and a half cups of cream? Very unusual... From my experience, shoud be 3-4 yolks for that amount of cream in order to make a creamy texture...

A good egg custard, but not what I would consider creme brulee. I agree with the review from San Jose, CA: the result was too much like custard and not enough like the creme brulee I'm used to eating in restaurants. Having said that, it certianly doesn't taste bad...it's just not what I had in mind.

The texture of this recipe is very thick and custard like. I am used to a very creamy texture and will search for another recipe. I think 9 yolks is too many. However, the group I made this for raved and loved it.

I made the creme brulee without the berries, but the outcome was spectacular nonetheless. The recipe is quick and simple. I used a kitchen torch with brown sugar as someone suggested, but found the melting point of brown sugar to be lower than that of regular sugar, resulting in a burnt brown sugar layer. The outcome with regular sugar was much more appealing.

easy to make, the vanilla beans make the difference even though they are pricey.

A simply delightful desert. This was a hit with everyone in the dorm. even great with just some fresh fruit or even plain. I prefer to use a kitchen torch for a little more entertaining time and brown sugar instead of plain sugar to caramelize
