I made this last night and thought it was delicious! Very few ingredients makes it very inexpensive to make as well. I was surprised at how much flavor it had for so few ingredients!

This was ok but I think I prefer it as the building blocks to something else. It's a good base but I'd definitely tweak things next time. Use pine nuts instead, maybe some roasted tomatoes or eggplant...not sure but the garlic olive oil and pepper was a good foundation.

UGH! What a waste of time and ingredients. I vacillate between saying it had no flavor and saying it had a bad flavor. I was so surprised as I really like all the ingredients, but it was just ghastly.

I'll start by admitting that I substituted summer squash and used a spinach fettuccine. This recipe is simply delicious and its a quick way to prepare a summer weeknight meal. I used some of the crumble topping that was leftover the next day on grilled veggies and I think it will be my new go-to recipe for that.

This was very delicious for such a fast and easy recipe. I used about half the pasta, and the two of us ate it all. It is a great dish to prepare on a hot summer day. I will certainly make it again.

I would rate this a "good, not GREAT". But for once truly is a "30 minute" start-to-table, so I will probably be making it again. Halves easily for two.
