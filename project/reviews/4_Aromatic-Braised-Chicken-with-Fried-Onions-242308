CURRY LEAVES DO NOT EQUAL CURRY POWDER! there is no substitute for curry leaves. you can try basil or bay leaf but it won't be exactly the same.

This recipe was very very good. I didn't have shallots so used an onion and hot curry powder as opposed to the leaves. The fried onions could stand on their own if this were a world without cholesterol. The cooking method was different for me (sauce) but it was easy...just a little time consuming. Really nice company or special occasion dish...very impressive.

I didn't have shallots so I just used spanish onions for the onions called in the recipe. Altogether is was quite delicious. I was very weary of having the onions on the side since I am a health nut but I was very surprised to see them be much lighter than expected since they were just dusted with flour really. FABULOUS RECIPE! MUST TRY!

The smell of this dish was amazing. I couldn't find any curry leaves so I replaced that with 2 teaspoons of curry powder. Just the right amount of bite to it. Loved it, would definitely make it again!

Made this last night and it turned out great! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead and reduced the simmering time. I had also marinated it for the afternoon instead of the hour suggested. It came out with just the right amount of heat. Delicious! The onions took longer than the 2-3 minutes per batch, but it may have been my oil temperature. I recommend having a cooling side like a raita or yogurt dip to break up the heat. Will definitely make this again!

Tried this recipe the other night and was pleased with the results. Really pretty simple to make. Followed the directions pretty much exactly except I substituted curry powder for the fresh curry leaves (as if....). Went a little heavier on the cloves and doubled the garlic. Delicious, big hit with the wife.

Sitting here eating my leftovers, I feel compelled to write a review of this dish. The flavor combinations are out of this world and every bite is an explosion of unique flavors. It was a bit time consuming for a weekday meal, but totally worth it. I marinated the chicken overnight, which worked out beautifully. Next time I will try using bonless thighs, as it will be easier to eat. I may also try putting the whole spices in a spice bag or cheesecloth after marinating, because they tend to get in the way when you're trying to eat it. I served it with plain white rice, which soaked up all the sauce. For those of you who don't like spicy foods, I would recommend cutting down on the cayenne. And if you don't want your kitchen to have the (wonderful) smell of fried onions, you may want to rethink making it - although you'll be missing out. I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious! And truly aromatic, as advertised. Recommend serving with rice and a cucumber riata sauce to cool it down. Fried onions added an interesting twist. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is not for the faint at heart, I like Indian food, but after I braised the chicken with the various spices I did not even finish the recipe. The fragrance was quite strong and my family voted to not finish it.

Wow! Just got this issue of Gourmet and because of my love for Indian food decided to give it a whirl. It is pretty simple to make and the results are spectacular. The chicken turns a beautiful reddish brown after frying, and the flavors are deep and as the recipe states; aromatic. The curry leaves and cloves are quite a powerful combination, but by my tastes appropriately balanced. The onions add a nice sweet, crisp contrast to the braise. I served with basamati rice. Highly recommended.
