I make this once a month. Best, simplest beef stock recipe I've found. I don't do the bouquet garni thing; I just toss the herbs into the pot. Otherwise, follow it to the letter. I will keep making this once a month.

Great aroma!

I found roasting the veggies really increased the sweetness of the stock the first time I made it. The second time I roasted the meat and added the veggies to the stock pot and it was much better.

This is a good basic stock recipe, and I like the addition of the veal bones. I would note that you need to avoid cutting the onion into small pieces as it's likely to burn being roasted for an hour. I chopped all the vegetables and it burned the onions. I scooped them out and started again. Don't skip the roasting stage -- it makes all the difference in the flavor and color of a brown stock.
