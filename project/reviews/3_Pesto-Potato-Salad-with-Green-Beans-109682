I wanted to like this salad, but was disappointed. I used good quality ingredients, but the flavor was bland and the pesto just made the potatoes look gray. Will not make this again.

I made this recipe with some modifications - I added a lot of fresh ground pepper, chopped up peppered bacon, paprika, a little sea salt, replaced the green onions with shallots and topped it with parmesan. It turned out so good!! I took it to a party with some friends, and everyone raved about it, and I will definitley make it again this way

This was very easy to make and is an excellent recipe. There were several adults at this dinner and each asked for a copy of the recipe. I would suggest letting it reach room temperature before serving.

Very good -- interesting combination of flavors.

I made this just with the potatoes (red), scallions and some left over home made pesto. Very good and very easy.

Great recipe. I used homemade pesto with a touch of cayenne spice. Also, I added finely chopped and pan-fried crispy pancetta...good color, and flavor. As I could find no white balsamic, I tried the recipe w/champagne vinegar.

I loved this! I bought really great Pesto so that might have helped. Added a bit more onion. It is a wonderful change from the usual and you don't have to worry about leaving it out for a while like the mayo salad types. (Nothing ruins a party more than food poisening) I will make this again.

Add a bit of chilli to taste, use home made pesto, moisten with an egg based mayo, thin down with red balsamic if needed

We tried the pasta salad version that another reviewer posted and it was great, but I didn't add vinegar and I mixed 1/4 cup yogurt into the pesto per another recipe on this site. The yogurt gave a slight creaminess to the salad. Easy to make and a great starting point for any random vegetables you have on hand. tabasco, extra garlic, capers, etc. are some things that might make this more interesting.

We make this all the time, but we make it as a pasta salad. Great warm or cold. Once pasta boils add sliced red potatoes then once boiling again add green beans. When green beans cooked (about 2-3min) dish done. Rinse and stir in pesto and serve. Love how the starches work well together. enjoy

I'd have to agree with the other reviewers; this recipe needs... something. Potatoes and green beans are pretty bland and while pesto is garlicky, it doesn't have much spunk. I added about 1.5 cups of white corn and the sweetness helped. I think that plus some sun dried tomatoes might do the trick.

i used russet potatoes and only made half the recipe. i ended up using the whole amount of pesto since i love pesto. it was good but not as good as i thought. my husband thought it would be better cold than room temp. so the next day we had it cold with lunch and it was gross. i threw it away. i don't know what would improve it but sundried tomatoes sounded pretty good.

Skip the vinegar and green onion, add chopped sun-dried tomatoes! Yum!

This seemed to be a case of a recipe looking better on paper than it actually tasted. Very easy to make, but it was the least touched item at a recent barbecue and nothing stood out regarding the flavor. Probably won't make again.

I halved the recipe and it worked OK. It's a pleasant change from the traditional mayonnaise-based dressing potato salad. Nice on a warm summer night.

This was very good and fresh. I used small red new potatoes and shallots instead of green onions. I loved the addition of green beans and it was a nice change from the traditional potato salad.

Since it's summertime, I'm always looking for good potato salad recipes. I liked this but did make some modifications. First of all, I made it for 2 people so I halved all ingredients except for the pesto. I only used 2 T. prepared pesto because my husband doesn't really care for it. He actually liked the dish. I will definitely try this again but will make it a couple hours before serving...did plan far enough in advance today.
