Yum! I am a sucker for anything with spicy mayo... and this was so easy to make. I used tilapia, and it took about 11 minutes to broil all the way through.

I made the slaw from this recipe and loved it! I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup fat-free yogurt but almost the whole amount of chipotle.

With a couple additions/changes, I rate this a four. Used sour cream instead of mayo and adobo sauce instead of chipotle powder. Added lime juice to sauce. Grilled a poblano pepper and used pepper strips as garnish. Used avacado as garnish as well. Absolutely loved it.

As quick and easy as these were, I thought these tacos were awesome!

Like other reviewers, I found it wanting in something more. I made the slaw with buttermilk instead of yogurt, squeezed in some lime juice, and used chipotle sauce from adobo peppers in place of the powder. Yum! I also added some frozen corn kernels to the slaw.

These were fine -- nothing special. The ten-minute prep time was nice, especially for a weeknight, but if you have time, make the Fried Fish Tacos on this site (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/103714) instead. I added guacamole and salsa on top to make these less boring. (And it may be heretical to say so, but I think I prefer plain sour cream to the Rubio's-style sauce in this recipe. Mayonnaise on tacos must be an aquired taste.)

Awesome fish tacos, I fried the fish, which is the true way to make fish tacos. Also, used broccoli slaw, which I had never seen before but added an extra crunch.I kicked up the spices a bit, not a quick meal but will make again soon.

I used snapper. The slaw was good but this taco needs a little more ump. I will make it again an play around with additions.

Yum! We breaded and fried the fish (broiled just sounded too boring!), which I think added a lot of great texture. Coleslaw recipe is a keeper on its own - delish!!
