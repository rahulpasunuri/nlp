Enjoyed adding sweet yam to the traditional "beef-and-broccoli" recipe! I marinated the beef in Tamari soy sauce, fresh ginger, garlic, and fresh ground pepper and added to the pan with the recipe sauce. Excellent!

As did others, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 tablespoon, and was glad I did so. Pretty tasty!

This is a delicious and pretty simple meal to prepare quickly. The times listed in the recipe seemed too short -- but it probably depends on the kind of pan/wok you're using. Like others suggested, I doubled the sauce and halved the sugar and it was great. Next time I'll probably make a little more sauce.

If you're looking for authentic Chinese-it isn't supposed to be. If you're looking for a quick delicious meal during the week this is great. Agree with cutting the sugar. Great way to boost nutrition with broccoli and yams.

I decided to try something random from my Epicurious iPhone app. I dialed in beef as my main ingredient and found this recipe. I substituted crushed chillies for the crushed red pepper, and decided to coat my beef with whole wheat flour instead of cornstarch. I also substituted Chinese kale (gai lan) for the broccoli; other than that, I used this recipe as it was. It was delicious, and very easy to make. I served it over steamed long grain rice just a little on the sticky side. Tasted like I was eating little bites of heaven.

A nice way to incorporate yams, but too sweet, even after reducing sugar to just over 1 TB per other reviewers. I wonder if recipe had a typo and it should have been 3 tsp (1 TB) brown sugar. I think 1/2 tsp would be just right. A bit spicy. I used less sesame oil and it came out fine. Served with some jasmine rice. Had to cook longer than directed to get yams soft enough. Good once for a change of pace but won't make again.

This was tasty! I took the advice from other reviews and doubled the sauce and still only used 1.5 TBSP Brown sugar. I also didn't have cornstarch but added a little flower to thicken up the sauce. Super easy, quick and my husband liked it.

I thought this was a pretty tasty dish & easy to make. Like the other reviewers I added less brown sugar and increased the red pepper flakes. Both kids ate it right up!

ZZZ,ZZZZ,ZZZ Ho-hum recipe. Very lacking if you are expecting an authentic Chinese dish.

This recipe is good start, though it needs some help. Like others, I would reduce the brown sugar, the yams are sweet enough. Also, I added some red bell pepper and doubled my red pepper flakes. Lastly, the sesame oil is used instead of vegetable oil, make sure not to add it to the sauce.

I FOUND THIS TO SWEET,SO I CUT THE BROWN SUGAR BY HALF AND ADDED SOY SAUCE AND SAUTEED GREEN BELL PEPPERS THAT WERE JULIEANED.IT ALSO CALLED FOR SESAME OIL,BUT NO WHERE TO PUT IT SO I PUT IT IN THE TOP FOUR .WHICH TURNED INTO THE TOP FIVE.I ALSO PRE-COOKED MY BROCCOLI,AND ADDED IT AT THE VERY END OF THE DISH.TURNS OUT VERY GOOD THIS WAY.

Easy, but just okay tasting. I omitted the ginger and the dish did not have that Chinese restaurant taste. If I made again, I would definitely reduce the sugar to 1 Tablespoon.

Adding yams to Broccoli Beef sounded interesting but this is not a good recipe. The sauce is way too sweet and uninteresting. Maybe kids will like it but anyone who likes real Chinese food will not.

solid recipe. it was too sweet for me so i would definitely reduce the amount of brown sugar to only one tablespoon. i also used very little corn starch and enjoyed the way the sauce came out. i also used an entire tablespoon of crushed red pepper. i like it really spicy and it did the trick!

Good flavors overall, but would recommend reducing amount of cornstarch. Also, be sure to keep potato pieces on the small side-- mine were a bit too big, resulting in my having to overcook the broccoli.

Made this recipe last night for dinner. Both boys (10 and 14 years old) had seconds and even thirds. They loved this dish. The yams added just the right amount of sweetness. Served with ginger infused fried rice and we had a real winner. I doubled recipe for a family of 4 (and thank goodness I did).
