The corn bread part of this recipe leaves a lot to be desired. It's not light and airy. Next time I will use my own corn bread recipe but will add in the red pepper and pecan - that part I liked

Can't believe I waited 2 years to make this again. This time, I used 1/4 cup of canned, diced green chiles (drained), instead of bell pepper. Served it with another kind of bean soup. Sensational.

This cornbread is the PERFECT compliment to white or red chilli or black beans. A hearty cornbread, this one truly adds to the meal. I substituted 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper for the cayenne...simply because I was out of cayenne. It worked great! The guys raved!!!
