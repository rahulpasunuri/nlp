This was super easy and full of flavor. It looks festive in the shells with the topping. Definitely a keeper with all the mussels we have on Cape Cod.

These babies ROCK. Pushed the boiled egg through a strainer and made it exceptionally fine. A funky treat with a sophisticated edge.

I made this appetizer for a wine club dinner, and had several people ask me for the recipe. (Comments were things like "It tastes "fresh" ", and "I don't like mussels, but I like this!") I made the dish 2 hours prior to going to the dinner, and doubled the receipe so that I could try the other reviewers' recommendations to make it the night before. Agree with them that this dish is even better when you can allow the mussles to marinate overnight.

Excellent! Marinated overnight,and added more salt before spooning into shells. An easy & different appetizer. Everyone who eats mussels will rave about this!

A four forker! I reserve this for the best. This recipe was simple and amazing. It was good the night of (marniated for about 5 hours), it was even better the next day. I took it to a closing night party for a theater, and they dissappeared about as fast as could put them out... fortunately I saved a couple for the next day. I doubled the recipe, but did not quite double the tarragon. I think that was the right decision, particulary for the longer marinate time. Yum!
