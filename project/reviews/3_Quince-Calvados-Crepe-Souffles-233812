Delicious, this was a huge hit at a dinner party last year. They're very delicate, fragrant and sophisticated. It seems like a lot of work overall but if you can prepare the crepes and quince before hand, you can make it easier on yourself.

Lots of work involved here for not a lot of payoff. It wasn't very sweet, and really tasted like something was missing--what, I don't know, but something.
