Super easy to make! I usually add a bit more lemon juice and garlic but that's because I don't make it 6 hours ahead. I make this all the time and always love it!

Great with sandwiches made on pita bread. I suggest adding a little Worcestershire for that extra kick.

I was looking for something to punch up my tuna steaks (done in a grill pan with some garlic, fresh thyme and oregano), and this fit the bill! I also added a little freshly ground black pepper. It wasn't as thick as I was hoping, and next time I will experiment with roasted garlic and/or herbs. It was great nonetheless.
