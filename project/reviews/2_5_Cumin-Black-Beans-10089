Very good. Have made many times and with variations. Although it adds some bitterness, I no longer wash beans (flavor is also in the bean juice - final result is not as clean but more flavor). Substituted lime juice for 1/2 the OJ to match guacamole and salsa flavors; have added chili powder and Tabasco. From this basic recipe you can spice it up as much as you want. The keys are the cumin and cilantro (taste test the cilantro so it doesn't overpower). Try adding onion, jalapeno; whatever you want. Could be called Brazilian-style black beans. A very nice side dish that goes with many recipes from south of the US border. Yum.

Not too bad, but didn't knock my socks off. I added 1 tsp of sauteed minced garlic. I would suggest adding 1/2 cup of chopped fresh mint as in Epicurious' other Cumin Black Bean recipe. I'll try that next time. Served w/ Epicurious' Boneless Chicken w/ Red Chili Sauce. This recipe was incredible after a few alterations.

This is a really good basic dish, especially if you're short on time and you keep a can of black beans in your pantry for emergencies! I make it with coconut rice (recipe also found in epicurious) and fried plantains or bananas. The whole meal takes about 30 minutes to prepare. I've made it several times now and everyone always loves it.
