This dressing in particular is so refreshing. Disagree with other suggestion of using lemon yogurt as a shorcut - too sweet. The real lemon is what makes this so crisp and light! Great with any combo you find in your fridge.

Very good, pleasant flavor - great as a light lunch or summer dinner.

We made this salad for a dinner party exactly according to the recipe and found the combination of textures and flavors extremely refreshing and delicious. Our guests consumed virtually every morsel -- always a good indicator to me! I will definitely put this recipe in my keeper file.

Excellent recipe! Short cut, use lemon yogurt for the dressing base. The peeled broccoli stems worked fine. We tried with and without avocado, fine either way and if you're only making two servings, you don't have half an avocado left over.

this salad is right on, though it's more of a technique than an actual recipe. seriously, nearly any combination of ingredients will work here. in place of the kohlrabi, i threw in some red cabbage and raw fennel, and for more protein ad substance, i added cooked lentils and lightly fried polenta croutons. the dressing is delicious (i recommend adding more garlic), though when i made the full amount, my salad seemed a tad overdressed. anyway, this made a massive batch which i will happily be eating for lunch at work for days!

A good recipe with a lot of possibilities. Basically a chopped salad with a tasty dressing. The veggies worked well together and instead of romaine and chickpeas I added cooked quinoa; lentils or farro would work too. The toasted sunflower seeds make the dish.

We just had this for dinner last night and loved it. I had to sub out or go without a few items as they were not available at either my Farmers Market nor the grocery store. My husband loved it, the dressing was great. It was a lot of prep work though, but well worth it.
