This was outstanding. I took previous reviewers' advice and did not pre-cook the shrimp, I also used individual crocks for a cool presentation. I omitted the celery and chilis and added some red peppers to the filling. A total hit! Will make on a regular basis.

Delicious! This was super easy to prepare and a hit at my "big game" gathering. I followed the previous reviewers' advice and did not cook the shrimp before putting into the oven. And because we are shrimp lovers, I also put in extra shrimp.

Absolutely fabulous. A flavour explosion. Highly recommended. As others have said, double the prawns and don't cook them first.

I loved this, and my husband too - the latter was a surprise! Although I winged it as I went along - Re: filling - I substituted some salsa for the tomato sauce, more garlic, added tabasco, and the rest of the green chiles. I also used Emeril's basic seasoning as that's what I had. For the crust I halved the sugar. Used up the whole green bell pepper between the two and left out the red. Didn't make sense to get a whole one for 2 tablespoons. I also used regular shrimp - whatever we had on hand. Not sure exactly how much it was, but my husband thought it needed more. His other contributions - frying the shrimp before putting the whole thing in the oven to prevent any undercooking and "fishiness". Also he felt the crust could have been more substantial, so next time I will double that part of it. It was awesome - great dish for a dinner party!

Great recipe with a yummy combination of flavors. Like other reviewers I doubled the amount of shrimp and didn't bother to cook the shrimp prior to putting the casserole into the oven. The confetti cornbread topping with the filling bubbling underneath made of a lovely presentation.

Excellent recipe used Cajun spices since I didn't have Creole since fabulous!

Yeah, this is great! I've made it 3 times, and love it. I do double the shrimp, and don't bother cooking them for 2 minutes...they cook enough in the oven, and who wants tough shrimp! The cornbread topping is excellent. I plan on making it by itself one day. Being a New Orleanian, I think the flavors are perfect, and I would be proud to serve this to guests.

oh, yes.... oh, yes. This is good. The cornbread is fluffy, light, and a nice foil for the bright flavors underneath. Everybody loved it! Based on the wisdom of other reviewers, I almost tripled the shrimp (huge prawns from Costco, cut into thirds). Made the filling the day ahead WITHOUT the shrimp, cuz I didn't want it to get rubbery. Added the thawed shrimp to the filling and warmed the whole thing in the oven while the making the cornbread topping, then into the oven per the make-ahead instructions. The recipe calls for Creole seasoning, which is not the same as Cajun! Used Emeril's recipe for the seasoning (found on this site), which made the dish fantastic - wonderful balance of flavors. Skipped the peppers and chiles in the cornbread as others have - the golden browned cornbread top with the red bubbling juices showing around the edges makes a presentation that really gets your own juices flowing!

This was dee-li-cious!!!! I made it as written with the exception of adding 1/4lb scallops and 1/2lb shrimp. If you really like seafood, you can add even more. I will the next time I make it.

My husband loved this recipe. I know make it every other week. It was a hit. I substituted the corn bread crust with Jiffy cornbread mix. I added the 2 tablespoons of green/red pepper and 1/3 cup of sour cream. IT was delish! When you dollop the cornbread on top of the creole filling you'll think it wont be enough to cover but don't worry! It spreads and makes a nice crust over it. I also didn't have creole seasoning so I googled a recipe and it worked fantastic. Last thing, first time I made it - I didn't have the diced tomatoes or tomato sauce. I used regular spaghetti sauce (basil and tomato flavor) and it was STILL very tasty. Make sure you don't put too much or the filling will be runny. A+++++ RECIPE.

I really liked this. I thought the confetti in the cornbread was a nice touch. One problem, though. I didn't realize just how spicy a whole tablespoon of cajun seasoning is. My mother had two bites and nearly died. True story.

Mmmm, this was very good. I too did not put the peppers in the cornbread...just added red pepper to the filling. The only strange thing about this recipe is the amount of shrimp seems way off. I used 1 1/2 pounds of fresh gulf shrimp and just cut them into thirds. After it was done, I felt I could have used a little more! Most of the liquid did absorb, but you could probably cut down on it a bit if you want a firmer filling. Oh and I thought the amount of sugar was spot on. Not too sweet, just enough to offset the mild heat of the filling. All in all, a very good and easy recipe that I will make again.

Had a friend over for dinner after work tonight and rushed home to make this. Was well worth the effort. We both LOVED it and he jumped at the chance to take home leftovers. I doubled the shrimp, but otherwise made it exactly as written. Yum, yum, yum. (I would have to say that with normal serving sizes, it serves more like 4)

This was so delicious! I did make a few changes. I used red peppers and Anaheim peppers and put them in the filling, not the topping. I substituted half of the chicken broth with clam juice and used 12 oz of shrimp and 1/2 lb. of lump crab meat. I cooked this in individual crocks and the corn bread topping was done perfectly. It served 5 generously. The recipe is very easy to make - a keeper for sure!

I thought this was a rather good recipe although I used scallops instead of shrimp, because that is what I had at the time. However if anything it made the dish even better, and I think scallops keep longer than shrimp anyways, so I still able to enjoy it a week later. Also I don't know if I measured incorrectly or what, but I needed to use a much larger dish to cook in then the one that shows in the recipe

This is a new favourite at my home now! Sweet and spicy, crunchy and smooth, it's perfection! Even so, I changed a few things around: I doubled the recipe (and added even more shrimp - almost two pounds of regular, raw, peeled, thawed shrimp) and used a big, rectangular baking dish. I skipped the chicken broth (otherwise it would have been too liquid). And I also used Cajun spice ('cause that's what I had on hand). I just had it for lunch at the office (it reheats nicely) and couldn't keep silent anymore!

I was very concerned when I made this about the tomato smell. I am not fond of the tomato soup smell or taste. When finished I found this to be a most enjoyable meal. I did not use shrimp but subsituted a 14oz pkg of crawfish tail meatl. And it was AWSUME!!! I would the next time also use mini diced tomatoes instead of regular diced tomatoes. I will also make it in an iron skillit the next time. It is a dish that i would fix for a regular family meal or for company. Thank You.

Whoever wrote that this was perfect for a cast-iron skillet was right on the money. That's how I did it last night and it came out perfectly. The topping was light and fluffy in the middle and crisp on the outside. I made a few modifications: 1) I also reduced the sugar to 1 teaspoon and left out the confetti elements of the topping, so it was more of a straightforward corn bread on top. 2) I didn't have bay shrimp, so I just used some regular frozen shrimp (thawed first, then chopped, and then tossed into the sauce to cook at the same point the bay shrimp would have gone in). The final result was a huge hit and looked so beautiful I had to take a picture of it before we ate. Will definitely make this again! I could also see substituting keilbasa or andouille sausage for the shrimp, or maybe even combining the two. Many possibilities...

I used chicken instead of shrimp so my daughter who is allergic to shellfish could have it. It was wonderful. I will make it again and again. I did use 1/2 the amount of sugar, as was suggested by someone else. Mmmmm

In a word, AWESOME. I too added extra cheyanne pepper. My family and I have lived in SW LA., born and raised all our lives. We like things spicier than most recipes call for.

Changes: 1. I added 1/4 t. of cayenne pepper, which added the perfect level of heat to offset the sweet cornbread. 2. I didn't have any creole seasoning, so I added all of my seasonings that are often in creole: basil, oregeno, pepper, praprika, salt. 3. I used 12 oz. of shrimp instead of 8. 4. I put the chile peppers in the filling instead of the cornbread... I didn't want the "confetti" look, so I didn't use any peppers in the cornbread. This recipe was great and my guests loved it. The center of the cornbread didn't bake entirely, so I served from around the edges and put the middle back in the oven for about 15 minutes. It definitely only feeds 4 generously, with maybe one leftover servng.

I assume the bay shrimp are already cooked since it just says to heat them???

My issue is with the bay shrimp. If this is to be a Creole filling, it must be made with Louisiana shrimp, or at least Gulf shrimp. The rest of the recipe fits with Creole cooking. You could use crawfish tails instead of the shrimp, which would be great. I have not tried this yet, but definitely will.

This recipe screams for a cast iron skillet - saves dishes, you can make the filling in the same pan that you bake it in - and cornbread belongs in cast iron. I plan to test this assumption tonight.

To bylikesgoodfood from connecticut - The Topping section lists "2 eggs at room temperature" and "1/2 cup corn kernels". Haven't tried recipe so will rate later.

This recipe wasn't complete. The preparation called for eggs, however there were none listed in the ingredients, so I guessed 2 since it called eggs(plural). In the ingredients it called for corn kernels again they weren't listed in the preparation, so i added them to the cornbread mixture with the rest of the ingredients. It is in the oven will reprot back when it's finished baking.

Yummy! I omitted the sugar because my husband is a diabetic. I added peperoncino because we love it and voila` a meal to delight our palate. Will cook this again.

Not bad, but more trouble than it was worth. Next time, I'll simply make the filling, and serve it with hunks of warm cornbread baked in a cast iron skillet. And my way gets it on the table faster. I can prepare the filling while the cornbread is in the oven.

I followed the recipe exactly and the result was terrible. The filling was far too sweet and lacked any zip to balance that sugary taste. And because the filling was so overly moist, the cornbread topping didn't get firm enough to be appetising (despite the lovely brown crust which was good). This is my first absolutely negative review - everything was so disappointing about this recipe, it's not worth a second chance in my kitchen! It's a shame because the concept is great...

I made this recipe exactly as written (a rarity) - the results were amazing. My guests went nuts. Given the bread topping, I was concerned about how it would taste second day, but it was almost as good for lunch as it was for dinner. Highly recommended!

Adding to my last comment. I baked this in a 10 x 14 inch. dish. Seemed way to much for 8x8

omg. my husband and I had this dish for dinner with a side salad, this evening. I had my doubts as to the outcome, but it turned out beautifully. I made moderate changes (nothing to really change the dish)such as, adding 340 gms. of mixed shrimp and bay scallops and a tsp. of sugar to the filling. I thought the creole seasoning would be hotter, so would add some hot pepper next time since the whole dish had a sweetness to it that demands a bit of heat. used a cup of fresh corn so added some cream to make up for the creamed corn. The filling seemed a bit thin and the corn bread mixture kind of sank into it but, it baked up beautifully and formed a crust. Divine. There is no way it would feed 6 to 8 people since I added more seafood and the two of us ate half of it.
