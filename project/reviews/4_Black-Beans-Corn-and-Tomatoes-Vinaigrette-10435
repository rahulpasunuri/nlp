This is my favorite summer dish right now. I used canned beans, canned or frozen corn, canned roasted tomatoes, and I've used lime and lemon, fresh and dried cilantro. I prefer the lime over the lemon. Definitely the fresh cilantro over the dried (but in a pinch the dried was still delish) I put all the cans in the fridge so when I want to make it, it's already cold! It is wonderful as soon as you stir it up and just as wonderful later. I love it!

Everyone so far has had great input about this salad! Lime juice was a key improvement, I also added a jalapeno and garnished it with fresh avocado at the last minute.

SO FABULOUS. I could eat this salad for every meal on every day! I don't know what it is - it seems so simple, but the flavors are just out of this world!!! I subbed lime juice for lemon, and used half the amount of dressing called for in an attempt to cut down the fat and calories. I let it chill in the fridge for a few hours before serving, and had a little left over the next day, too. Even better after chilling all night!

Used this recipe as a jumping off point. Used fresh local sweet corn, tomatoes, and canned black beans. Added lime juice, fresh cilantro, green onions and some salt (skipped the olive oil). Next time I'll double the recipe... it was a refreshing dish and as the other readers mentioned, even better the next day!

This salad is absolutely fantastic! Use canned beans, fresh corn, good tomatoes and a handful of chopped cilantro and you've got an easy dish to die for. Do let it sit overnight, and do make a lot because you'll want leftovers for days. BTW, it's fantastic with scrambled eggs for brunch. Yum!

Great dish! I used canned beans and frozen corn that was thawed. It's better with fresh corn, but not significantly better if it's a hassle. I cut the dressing by 1/2, and added only 1/2 of the salt and it was delicious.

This is so easy, versatile, and yummy. I use frozen white shoepeg corn and don't even bother to thaw it. This dish is best made the night before you serve it, so the corn has time to thaw anyway. I've made it several times, and the most recent time decided to add some chopped fresh jalapeno - nice kick! I also use canned black beans, and sometimes add fresh chopped avocado just before serving. It goes with everything!

This is fabulous, with several changes as recommended by other reviewers: used two cans of black beans (rinsed and drained), used the fresh corn uncooked (sweet, crunchy, and easy), replaced tomatoes with grape tomatoes cut in half, used lime instead of lemon juice, and cut down the salt to one teaspoon. The first time I made it it was a bit salty, possibly due to using the canned beans, so reducing the salt to one teaspoon was just perfect. Note: supermarkets around here call the fresh leaves cilantro, not coriander - it's one in the same.

When tomatoes are not in season, this works beautifully with diced red and orange sweet peppers instead. I agree with the reader who preferred lime juice to lemon in the vinaigrette; I also use red onion instead of scallions.

I was hesitant to use the canned beans but it was a no-brainer. Followed exactly with fresh corn. Easy, quick and will make again.

Excellent dish! I made it with sweet corn roasted on the grill, and used lime juice instead of lemon. A new family favorite.

I used frozen corn thawed in cold water and used canned beans and a yellow onion. Sooo yummy, especially the next day or so. A new staple for summer bbq for sure.

I have been preparing this since 1990 and it is a favorite. I make it exactly as instructed most of the time, but it is just as good with canned beans. Sometimes I serve it over rice and it makes a great one dish meal. The best black bean salad recipe out there!

Terrific! I used canned beans, just because it was faster. I cut the corn right off the cob with out cooking it. It gives the salad some crunch, which is a nice contrast to the soft beans. I tried it once with frozen corn and it was mushy! The fresh coriander makes it a great summer dish. I took it to a BBQ and everyone loved it!

Very tasty and easy to make. I used canned beans as more convenient (and to avoid running the stove mid-summer!)...other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I received this recipe from two foreign service friends, Kurt and Ampara, in the early 90s and have been making it ever since. It's wonderful - and clearly a classic.

This is a great recipe - easy, fresh and delicious. I also used canned beans, and used very little oil as it doesn't really need it. Used one clove of finely minced garlic, a little cumin and also a chopped red pepper. This dish not only tastes great, but it is so colorful.

I was looking for a recipe to take to a large group pot luck; a recipe that would not take all day or heat up the kitchen, but would be delicious. When something on this site gets 100% would make it again, that is a good clue. Following the advice of other reviewers, I used canned beans and frozen sweet corn. I also doubled the ingredients, except the dressing, of which I made 1 1/2 times the amount. Perfect! One reviewer suggested cumin, which I considered (I love it, especially with black beans) but, when I tasted the salad, it needed nothing else. Great recipe.

This is a fabulous summer dish! I used fresh local corn right off the cob(raw)...no need to cook if the kernels are small. Be sure to use fresh cilantro (coriander) or it will not be the same. This one's a keeper!

This is definitely a winner. I added diced ripe sweet mango which was a great addition. I also halved the oil and lemon juice the second time I made it b/c the original recipe made too much liquid.

Cheated and used canned beans. Didn't need garlic as others suggested becuase my coriander and scallions were so fresh. I did not want overwhelm the taste with garlic. Refreshing and healthy. A keeper.

Cheated a litle, in the interest of time, by using canned black beans (Goya), rinsed and drained. Per the suggestions of other reviewers, added one clove of minced garlic, fresh ground black pepper, and reduced the salt because the beans already contained some. Will definitely make this again.. easy, delicious, and healthy. My boyfriend is on a diet and I am quickly tiring of lettuce/greens based salads, but don't want to change to more fattening pasta or mayonnaise based options. This was a perfect choice to remain healthy, but change the pace.

I made this last night at the last minute; used 2 cans of beans & frozen corn, and tossed it together as my guests were walking in the door - I loved it and so easy. Served with fajitas and ate outside, great summer evening side dish. I realized at the end that I didn't warm the beans so was concerned that the flavors wouldn't meld much, but that wasn't a problem. Also having it for lunch today wrapped in tortillas, still good.

I enjoyed a similar dish while on vacation in Colorado. I came home with a yearning for it so of course I headed for Epicurious. My husband and I both loved this recipe. I did use lime instead of lemon, lime is a little stronger I think, so go easy and taste till right. I also used canned beans. We happened to have grilled chicken breasts the night we had this, it was great over the chicken and alone as a salsa with chips.

woa. I used canned beans to save time and should have thus reduced the salt to just 1 teaspoon. I am going to thaw a pound of frozen corn to try to dilute!

I have made this recipe countless times however, instead of serving it as a salad, I serve it as a dip with lemon/lime flavored tortilla chips. These lime chips enhance the flavour of the dip...delicious! It never fails....there are numerous requests for the recipe and requests to make it for the next party. I have used both the canned black beans and prepared the beans from scratch. I have found that the canned beans work well while cutting back on the preparation time.

Quick and easy using canned black beans, rinsed. Try this variation for the vinaigrette: Exchange lime for lemon; reduce salt to 1/2 tsp.; add 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and a dash of hot sauce. Delicious!

I used canned beans and canned corn. It came out wonderful but it definitely needs to sit for an hour or two to soak up the flavors.

I've made this recipe several times, and always got rave reviews from guests. A word to the wise: fresh coriander is actually cilantro -- it's the same plant, but the leaves are called cilantro and the seeds are called coriander.

This dish was great because of its freshness and simplicity. i would probably cut down on the oil and lemon juice next time, because it gets awful zippy, but a refreshing and tasty salad nonetheless.

This was good - I didn't have coriander sprigs so I ground up a bit of seed - also added chopped cucumber and a little jalapeno for zip.

Wow! I made this with canned black beans and parsley, because I couldn't get cilantro. I dislike cilantro, anyway! It was delicious with our main dish of steak!

I made this dish as an accompaniment to cajun boiled shrimp for a party, and everyone loved it. The salad looks beautiful and tasts wonderful. I used lime juice instead of lemon - lemon would be too sour - and canned black beans for ease of preparation. I recommend chilling the salad overnight for the best flavor.

This salad is a favorite for company and family. My husband says if he had to be a vegetarian he would live on this salad. I substituted lime for the lemon and I think it highlights the cilantro a bit better.

This is a great summer salad, especially for an outdoor party when you don't want a mayonaise-based salad sitting out when it's hot. I used half lime juice and half lemon, with good results. I also cut way back on the quantitity of beans, maybe 2/3 of a pound, which made for a lovely color balance.
