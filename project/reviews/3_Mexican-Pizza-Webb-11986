This pizza has been served for family and friends many times since I discovered the recipe in Gourmet. Everyone has loved the different mix of flavors. The only change I have made is that I use my bread machine to make the pizza dough. Will continue to be a family favorite!

I have made this recipe many times and love it. This pizza has a very different tast, so it will not appeal to everyone. I use Trader Joes corn meal dough which works great.

This pizza is really different but very good. I have had a large pizza party and served many of them with requests for more. Will make again.

This recipe started off fine but all of the sudden just didnt seem right. Had a very bad taste....missing something.

I'm going to qualify the yes, because I won't remake it exactly as written. The 3 stars are also qualified because only my daughter loved this pizza as written. In the sauce I will reduce the tomatillos to 3/4 lb. and add about 3/4 cup chicken broth to reduce the tartness in the sauce.We really liked this crust and I have a pizza stone, so corn meal works great. I will also omit the green olives because they didn't compliment the other flavors.

I have made this pizza three times. I changed the crust receipe and make it in the food processor. So much easier and better. Also, I oil the pan instead of using corn meal (it stuck. Tried using polenta instead of corn meal (don't). Also, use whole can of black beans.
