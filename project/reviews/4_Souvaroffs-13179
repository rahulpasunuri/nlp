I made these in the shape of dog biscuits with little heart cuts outs filled with the raspberry jam to send as a camp care package from the dog. They were not only so adorable, they tasted so good, they almost didn't make it into the box.

These are delicious! They're not overly sweet until you get to the delectably fruity center. This is also a very easy recipe.

Delicious cookie. For a slightly sweeter cookie, I rolled out the dough in powdered sugar. It was a big hit at the office!

I am not quite sure of how the cookies are supposed to look like at the end (a picture would have helped) but they taste terrific. A friend of mine who is known to be very picky asks for those on a regular basis.

I've been making these cookies to include in my Christmas tins since 1991. They're still a must.

Very simple and easy to adapt (i'm vegan and used Egg substitute and margarine instead) the cookies are light in texture and flavor. I also like using blackberry or peach preserves for the cookie. Definitely a crowd pleaser as I make it for my organization's coffeehouses every month and each time there's no leftovers.

My family loved this, especially with the apricotperserves
