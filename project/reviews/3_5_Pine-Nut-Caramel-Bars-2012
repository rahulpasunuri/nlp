Love this recipe - so great if I need to come up with a dessert quick and don't have time to get to the store. The ingredients are all things I always keep in my pantry.

I make these for the winter holidays, and for gifts throughout the year; they're excellent. I use a combination of pine nuts and sliced almonds. I do find the crust too buttery, and have cut 2Ts out without any problem.

This is one of my most favorite cookie bar ever and the best way to get a nice pine nut fix rather than just a few sprinkles on a salad or pasta. I started making this when it came out in 1993 when I was catering to crowds at Mercer Island Concerts at the park. They were a big hit then and I hope again tonight for a Tapas party finale! yummmm

This is a wonderful dessert, rustic and filling without being too sweet. Pine nuts give it unique flavor and appearance you don't get with other nuts. I've made this around the holidays every year since it was originally published (10 yrs. +?) and friends and family always rave about it and want more. They request it every year. Definitely a keeper!

My wife and I love this recipe; we make it every year at Christmas time for friends and family and it gets rave reviews. Easy to make and it stores well. Highly recommended!

Essentially candy in a crust, so very sweet and rich. The pine nuts make it a different sort of dessert, but it would also be good with pecans or walnuts instead. Very tasty, but too sweet for me to want to make it very often.
