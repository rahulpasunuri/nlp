This was really tasty. It was my first time eating venison steaks and this was a really great introductio to them. I only made two steaks, so we had lots of leftover sauce that was really good on baked potaotes. I'll 100% make the sauce again. I'll probably put it on beef though, since I don't have great access to venison. Also, I substituted lavender infused gin for the aquavit, and it was really good.

A scrumptious meal, the various flavors meld together into a lusciously rich sauce. I suggest a bit of a thickening agent towards the end to finish the sauce.
