This was edible but did not make my taste buds sing and dance. If you wish to have the taste of this dish with out all the cooking, mash a bit of jalopeno over a kumquat and eat with a bit of pork. The flavors did not marry at all for me. I was unimpressed.

This was my first attempt at pork tenderloin, and it was delicious and very easy! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The only changes I made were reducing the sugar added to the marmalade recipe, and I also added some lemon juice for more acidity. I served it with grilled zucchini and a simple cous cous with toasted pine nuts and crumbled sheep cheese.

My husband and I look forward to kumquat season particularly so we can enjoy this recipe again. I often prepare it for guests who also love this entree and request the recipe. It is a favorite way to serve pork tenderloin which I make frequently as an alternative to less lean cuts of meat. I especially enjoy the various layers of flavor in the relish - sweet with accents of tart and spicey notes from the jalapeno. I highly recommend this.

I enjoyed the marmalade very much, but found that its strong flavor really overpowered the pork. The two components just did not seem like an ideal pairing to me. My husband suggested using the marmalade as a relish with spicy sausage - that might be a better match. Two tips: look for larger kumquats, as it's much easier to locate the seeds inside them. Also, you'll likely have to buy them by weight, so keep in mind that you'll need to buy about 3/4 of a pound to get the 2 cups you need for this recipe.

Terrific when made and great as left overs. Dusted pork generously with cumin and let sit for 1+ hours before browning. Added 1 seeded smoked/dried black hungarian pepper to the marmalade while boiling, then removed before serving. Increased the jalapeno to 4T. Will make again and again.

Great chutney like accompaniment to pork or chicken for that matter!

Excellent! This was a winner. Teh Sauce take a while to make, but can be stored in the freezer and used for other dishes as well.

We have a prolific kumquat tree and was having a difficult time using them all up. Not any more! We loved this and will have it often when the fruit is ripe!

I made this with pork chops instead of pork loin, (brined, pan-seared and then finished in the oven) since it's just two of us, and it was delicious. Halved the marmalade recipe and did the last few steps (water, sugar, salt) to taste... turned out great. The savory sweet spiciness is an excellent compliment to the pork. Served with rice and black beans with green and yellow bell pepper and a white wine. Some sliced avocado fanned out on top. I'd made it again.

I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. The kumquat-jalapeno marmalade was particularly good with the pork. There was quite alot of marmalade left over, though, so I would halve that part of the recipe next time (and also remember to wear my rubber gloves while mincing the jalapeno chiles.)

I feel like a total idiot. I cheerfully wrote down the ingrdients. At the store I stared at these tiny oranges named kumquats. I was darned if I was going to spend hours peeling them. Big duh, I didnt realize the peel was edible!

Pork tenderloin is pork tenderloin, and the marmalade is delicious. It's not too sweet, with one coherent flavor accented by bursts of heat from the jalapeños, freshness from the kumquats, and savoriness from the shallots. The texture was similar to a relish, not sticky like a jelly. I cut it in half and that worked out fine. This dish was easy & fast, a nice treat for kumquat season.
