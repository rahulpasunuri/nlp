i make a similar fried rice. for those who like it a bit spicier/more flavorful sautee minced garlic and ginger at beginning, add gravy master just a few drops instead of oyster sauce to give the rice that fried rice color (learned from joyce chen cookbook). i also like to add some cashews or almonds as garnish. i learned the basic recipe from my next door neighbor who cooked it as we were lit by candlelight when we had a blackout in nyc. i tweaked it with terrific pacific cookbook.

Prepared exactly according to recipe but took the review of geminale serious and I'm like it a litlle spicy. Therefore I replaced the rather dull tasting cooked ham with pre lightly crispy baked smoked bacon cubes and 1 TS white grounded pepper instead of 1/2 TS. Recipe just came out perfectly and according to my humble opinion 5 Stars.

Used 2c uncooked (4c cooked)basmati rice, cooked in rice cooker, then spread on parchment lined cookie sheet to cool. For veg, used diced carrot and celery and only had purple onion so diced some fine as well. 1 large clove garlic. Fried onion first until soft/brown, then added carrots and celery. When that done, added garlic. Used 2 beaten eggs - added these to cold rice and blended before adding to pan to cook. Stir fried then added oyster sauce, salt and sugar. Excellent flavour! Family all liked it. Would be excellent with chicken and shrimp - could beef up veg as well and make as a meal. Really enjoyed the mild flavour. Made with hoisin chicken leg recipe on Epicurious - excellent together.

I made it according to the recipe, and found it a bit dull taste-wise. Added 1T chopped fresh basil, which made all the difference. Without the basil, it gets 3 forks, with it, 4. Will make it again.

Made this last night but used peas and carrots instead of mushrooms and peas. Instead of ham, we used a small package of BBQ pork (the kind that comes with mustard and sesame seeds for dipping, but tossed those out. The pork had a better flavor than ham I think. We also used salad shrimp instead of the bigger shrimp, so we could leave it whole. It needed a bit more than the 1 Tbls oyster sauce to get enough flavor, probably double that. But it was fabulouse - we got up in the middle of the night and ate more - it was so good.

Excellent. Delicate flavor. The rice is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART of this recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the directions on the rice package and it was too mushy (but still delicious). You can try to dry out your leftover rice a bit before using it.

This is a terrific recipe. Since I am Jewish, I omitted the shrimp, ham, and oyster sauce. I used teriyaki sauce in place of the oyster sauce and didn't add the sugar. If you are vegetarian, you can do it this way! I cooked the rice in a rice cooker according to the usual way, adding more water than she suggested and this was a mistake. Next time, I will follow her advice and make the rice drier so that the end result is not as mushy.

I'll confess, I haven't made this recipe yet, but it looks delish. I always make fried rice with rice that has spent at least a day in the fridge. Cooks Illustrated can explain it better than I can, but it keeps the pieces of rice separate and not sticky.

Excellent recipe. I used brown organic rice, and shrimp that was already cooked. Didn't matter. It still tasted wonderful. I would make this again. Watch the video and follow the order of assembly exactly.

Definitely different than traditional fried rice, but I liked it. I mixed the beaten eggs into the rice right before adding both to the wok... I think that helped get the rice evenly coated. I used a rice cooker to make the rice and I think that was a mistake... notice how little water she uses to prepare the rice. I think it would have come out less sticky if I'd done it her way.

The recipe was excellent and watching the video helped immensely. You have to ensure the rice is boiled to the correct consistency. thank you for enlightening beginners like us!!

I followed the recipe exactly. Three eggs made it mushy. Also, it was lacking in flavor.

Great flavor. Surprisingly delicate. Ensure that you start with a properly cooked rice, or you'll have a sticky mess. I struggled using my large sautee, a wok would be much better.

Really excellent recipe for fried rice. It is worth the few minutes to watch the video, the order of ingredients into the wok was enlightening for me. We ate until it hurt!

Great! We will make it again. I left out the oyster sauce and it was still very good. Much less oily than the average US restaurant versions.

This was very easy and very good. I used small local shrimp and also added bean sprouts at the very end because i like the crunch. I added a bit too much oyster sauce--will stick to 1tbs next time.
