Exceptional, even with the caved-in middle (due to the flawed homemade baking powder). But the (very) sweet cake (especially the sugar top) and the tart rhubarb make an exceptional combination. There was no time to attempt the buttermilk ice cream, so I stirred a Tbs of sugar into an 8-oz cup of creme fraiche and drizzled that over the top. Putting it in the freezer for 15 minutes prior to serving might work also. The added sugar made it a bit sweet, but not overpoweringly so, and it made a nice buffer between the tart compote and the super-sweet cake. Definitely a keeper, and a nice change from strawberry/rhubarb.

I made the cake and it is very, very good in both taste and texture. It also froze very well. The compote is delicious as well and I added other berries to the mix and served with vanilla ice cream.

I needed an easy cake for a last minute dessert to bring to a dinner party at my parents'. So I cheated and served it with fresh cut strawberries and vanilla icecream. And it was still delicious. The perfect amount of orange flavor in the cake and was a great texture to accompany the berries and icecream. The fam loved it and will definately make it again.

I made this cake, with the Ice Cream and Compote for a special gathering of friends. It is delicious. Time consuming but very refreshing! Definitely will make again!

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday, and it turned out absolutely delicious. I brought homemade strawberry preserves to go alongside it, but the cake is amazing on its own. Moist and sweet and so easy to make. I will definitely be making this again.

Oh, and ps, I didn't do the sugar topping. Just a dusting of powdered sugar to pretty up the presentation.

Great cake, even after my oven didn't heat properly and it was in there for more than an hour. Served with the pomegranate tangerine sorbet from this site. Will def make again, as written and as accompaniment to other fruits and ice creams.

Loved this cake. I had most of the ingredients on hand and used regular baking powder instead of the homemade. I had some frozen berries in the freezer that I made into a warm compote. Family and dinner guests really liked the slightly crunchy texture. Definitely will make again.

This was very good - even when made with gluten-free flour. I added an extra egg to help it bind, and added extra orange zest. Will make again.

Made the cake and the rhubarb compote and both were delights. The cake has a great texture and the orange came through well.

I only made the cake from this recipe. I topped it with fresh raspberries (almost a version of the rhubarb compote) and a white wine syrup. The cake really didn't need the topping as it was wonderful on its own but the raspberries in white wine syrup pushed it over the edge. Unbelievably good! I will definitely be making the cake again.

I made the cake and the ice cream - I couldn't find fresh rhubarb. I substituted a rhubarb/reaspberry perserves I found at my local grocery store. I made the cake and ice cream exactly as the recipe is written. This is a great recipe for people that like desserts taht are not overly sweet. The buttermilk ice cream is really exceptional - I am trying to think of other things I can serve with it.

I made only the cornmeal cake. I omitted the sugar topping. The cake was simple to make and the sour cream made the cake have tenderness. The butter flavor also came through. We all enjoyed this easy and simple cake.
