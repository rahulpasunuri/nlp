This dish was good but didn't knock my socks off -- however, I didn't have any dried shrimp, so it's possible their flavour would have made the salad sing. I had just finished roasting eggplant and pearl onions when this salad came together -- adding a handful of them, as well as shrimp sauteed in ginger, garlic and lime made this so good. The recipe is a great starting place.

This is such a tasty dish! I added 1/2 tsp ginger and 1 tsp lemongrass puree and substituted Lemon for Lime and skipped the shrimp but it was still fabulous!!

Easy to make, refreshing, and pleasant- but not very interesting or very delicious. I wanted the dressing to be punchier and the salad overall to have more depth.

This was a hit. I followed other's advice and blanched beans (4 min), but think next time I would leave them raw. Delicious!

I as well blanched my green beans (for 6 minutes). I didn't have dried thai chilli so I used a fresh red chilli and I servicd it with Prawns. This will be going into my rotation as well.

This is a great salad! Wonderful flavors and textures. I did blanch the beans for a couple of minutes to soften them a bit and I'm glad I did. I made the coconut rice from the same section in the mag and they went together very well.

Flavors were fantastic (as were all in this article) but my boyfriend and I both felt that the beans could have used a quick blanch--I did buy Chinese long beans, and they just seemed a little tough. Otherwise, great!
