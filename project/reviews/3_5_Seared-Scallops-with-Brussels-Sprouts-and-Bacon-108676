My family really liked the dish. One thing I would change is that I would not blanch the brussel sprouts. By the time they were done cooking they were too mushy and instead of browning they started to burn. So just boiling in the chicken broth would be fine. I also changed the bacon part. I had already cooked the bacon for breakfast that morning and so used the leftover in he dish. I browned it in chopped pieces so that the brussel sprouts had the bacon flavor but did not add the bacon fat to the scallops. It was yummy and lower in fat because of the bacon rendering less of it. Yummy!

Loved this dish. I too did not boil the Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were delicious! Would serve to guests and make again!

I'm not sure what happened, but this recipe was very salty. The bacon overpowered the scallops. I liked the brussels sprouts.

DELISH - will definitely make this again! I think the sprouts were a little too soft, so will not par-boil next time to see the difference. The scallops were sweet and perfectly seasoned. I made the sauce, which tasted okay but wasn't needed...actually think it detracted from the dish rather than enhancing it.

This was a delicious meal. I followed the recipe except I skipped the sauce -- at the end just did a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the scallops. Wonderful meal -- easy and quick for weekday dinner -- wouldn't hesitate to serve to company. Definitely will make again. Served with spaghetti squash, leeks & mushrooms with a cream sauce.

I did not blanch the brussels sprouts but made the recipe otherwise as written. The brussels sprouts were really delicious--I would make them by themselves, without the scallops, any day. The scallops were good but the sauce was just okay. I did add some white wine, and I didn't have a problem with the cornstarch. In fact I recommend using it. But the flavors in the sauce weren't as good as I was expecting. No problems with too much salt--not sure what the other reviewer was experiencing. This is a good, solid recipe that is in fact quite simple--I mean, there are only a few ingredients! I will make it again but will probably try to improve on the sauce. We make scallops quite frequently so I must say that it is important to cook the scallops well and not too much. Otherwise, experiment with the sauce and you won't be dissatisfied.

Delicious & easy. Made for Valentine's Day dinner & didn't neat much else ecept bread to dip in sauce. Note: do NOT par boil Brussel Sprouts. I added them raw & they were perfect. Be sure to pat scallop dry befoer frying to get good sear.

I don't feel I should award the forks...I was really hungry for scallops. Typically we do the dijon/maple route and I was looking for something different. Do not blanch the sprouts..as they don't tend to brown well and you end up with mushy sprouts and they are just gross. Listen to another post and decrease the corn starch, but you probably don't even need it, as you end up with mushy, disgusting sprouts with paste covering them. Very disappointed as I have cooked tons of recipes from this site and this was a big waste of expensive scallops. I guess simple is best.

This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The flavors are well-balanced, rich, and delicious. It's a bit of work, but well worth it. I made it exactly as the recipe is written, and wouldn't change a thing. I've been making David Chang's brussel sprouts from Momofuku, which are awesome, but this is going into my regular rotation. Try it, you won't be sorry.

mmmm makes you love brussel sprouts. definitely use jumbo scallops and make sure they are dry to get color when you sear. go light on cornstarch.

Great recipe! Added some dry white wine to broth and through in some baby bella mushrooms. Elegant, but simple food.

I wanted this to be amazing, but it wasn't. Good, but not amazing. I recommend trying it, because the flavors blended well but maybe it's just not exactly my taste.

I only made the brussel sprouts from this recipe but can't wait to make the whole thing. Very good.

Other than using 4 bacon slices, we followed this recipe exactly. It was utterly delicious. The three of us stuffed ourselves! Make sure you have something like French bread at the table to soak up the wonderful sauce. We used a focaccia with herbs and sundried tomatoes. Spectacular meal! The best brussels sprouts I've ever eaten (and we make them all the time) and the scallops were tender and flavorful.

My husband deemed this "gourmet restaurant quality." Very flavorful, beautiful presentation. I followed the recipe as written, except I did not make the sauce -- instead I just drizzled lemon juice over the scallops. Wonderful!

Loved it! Will make for my next dinner party. No changes to suggest. Even with the addition of cornstarch, the sauce did not thicken greatly.

I'm not a big fan of brussels sprouts, but my husband brought some home from the market. I made the recipe with no changes - it was wonderful. The flavors and textures went together so well. I definitly will make it again.

Unconsciously, I always seem to serve this recipe for first-time dinner guests. They are always impressed. I follow the recipe exactly. It is very light, but filling.

Very very very good. I feared excess chickeniness, so I deglazed the scallop pan with white wine instead and skipped the cornstarch. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written. Unusual, easy and great. We ate it with orzo, which were perfect alongside.

Fabulous. This is the only way I have ever liked brussels sprouts. The scallops are wonderful and the sauce brings it all together. Try it!

A definite keeper! I used a little more bacon, otherwise followed instructions and served with smashed potatoes. Love it!!

I made this for my mother and my boyfriend and we all loved it. In response to the reviewer who thought the sauce was more appropriate for mashed potatoes... I didn't have any cornstarch when I made it, so the sauce remained very thin and light--it was just perfect. I could see it being too heavy if it were thicker.

My husband and I loved this recipe, would definitely have it again, use it as an appetizer, and/or serve it to guests. I made changes as follows: frozen brussels sprouts in butter sauce, microwaved per pckg. directions. (Don't cut in half.) Crumble bacon after frying. Use reg. chicken broth. Omit all additional salt. Use regular butter. Omit olive oil. Make sauce without brussels sprouts, leave uncovered, stir often 5-6 mins. Rinse scallops before patting dry. Sear in bacon drippings alone. Don't add brussels sprouts until the last minute, then just enough to heat through, along with sauce, bacon, and cooked scallops. Remove solids from pan with slotted spoon, then stir in cornstarch slurry. Remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice and serve. I served it with asian soba noodles with sauteed carrots, ginger, garlic and spinach, with a sauce of 1/3 c. water, 2 tsps. cornstarch, 1/8 c. dry sherry, 2 tblsps. soy sauce, 1/8 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. 5 spice powder mixed together and stirred in at the last minute.

I don't get why this recipe had so many rave reviews. Made this last night and I thought it was HORRIBLE. Yes, the sauce was good, but it is more suited to mashed potatoes & chicken than scallops! Like my husband said "What a waste of perfectly good (and expensive) scallops!" Next time, I'll make my usual sauce w/lemon juice, white wine, etc. and use spinach & mushrooms, & put on top of a bed of herbed fettucine and then finish off with a sprinkle of pine nuts!

I made this recipe using frozen brussel sprouts and regular chicken broth, as that's all I had on hand and didn't feel like venturing into the snowfall for the called for ingredients. I used one pound of sea scallops and all the rest of the ingredients in the proportions listed. It turned out delicious, although a little salty (I guess the low sodium broth would have corrected that...) I'm always looking for new ways to prepare scallops and this incorporated two of my favorites, bacon and sprouts! Made for an interesting entree. We had it with couscous and buttermilk biscuits. A perfect dinner for two that I will definitely repeat.

Served this over mashed potatoes and parsnips. Great fast meal with very little chopping involved. Beautiful presentation.

Yummy. I didn't watch the seafood guy as he scooped scallops, and ended up with one sea & a bunch of bays -- lesson learned. Yes, the brussel sprouts concoction was salty, but the scallops balanced, along with bread and couscous. Delicious and pretty easy -- very different dish. Made the sauce in regular proportions with only 1 lb of scallops and about 6-8 oz sprouts. Just right, as accompanied, for dinner for two.

This recipe is truely delicious. It's so quick and easy as well as pantry friendly (if you use frozen scallops and frozen brussel sprouts) that it is now one of my week night dinner choices.

This is a wonderful recipe with only minor adjustments needed. The suggestions from reviewers were appreciated and told me that the finest ingredients and techniques would make or break the recipe. I do disagree about not blanching the Brussels sprouts. I've never known blanching to take any flavor away, in fact I find it to do quite the opposite, and it helps keep the bright green color for a beautiful presentation. We did throw a pinch of sugar into the blanching water along with the salt. We had beautiful, delicious fresh scallops which did not exude much liquid. My modification to the recipe was at the very end. Instead of using cornstarch, I deglazed with Chardonnay and then maybe a half cup of the remaining broth and did a reduction before adding a little lemon juice. Great first course!

This is a really easy and quick recipe, an impressive dish. I would substitute Double Smoked Bacon, diced. Coat the scallops in Wondra Flour to get them crisp and brown. Also, don't bother blanching the brussel sprouts, as you lose the good flavor this way.

Great....Simple to prepare parts of this a few hours early and then do final prep in minutes. Should have added couscous to take advantage of the scrumptious sauce.

I agree, a good base recipe. Too salty for my taste. Minor adjustments with the bacon fat should alleviate that problem. Will try again.

This is a good base recipe, but needs more flavor, next time I will experiment. I also used bay scallops which I would not recomend, I would stick to the sea scallops as they would have browned better.
