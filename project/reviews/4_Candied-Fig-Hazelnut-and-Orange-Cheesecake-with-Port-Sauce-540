Really delicious. I made it and took to work for a party and never before had so many compliments! I followed the recipe except reduced the sugar in the sauce by half and added some fresh orange juice from the orange I zested. Really, really good. Do not forgo the sauce!!!

I think the problem the previous cook had with the figs is that she didn't cut off the hard stem portion of the fig, the stem will never soften no matter how much you cook it. This is a very good, very rich and stunning looking cheesecake. Enjoy!

From the other reviews, I was certain this would be a memorable cheesecake, but I didn't find it so. I'm not sure what I did wrong with the figs, but I cooked them to death and still found hard pieces, which I found unpleasant to bite into. I did enjoy the taste of the fig/port wine base, and the sauce was nice. I was disappointed with the cheesecake itself. The Frangelico was lost. We thought the cake did not gain any flavor from it. Last note, I substituted Hazelnut Biscotti for the vanilla wafers and hazelnuts. Worth considering. Overall, there are too many really good cheesecakes on my list to worry about this one.

An unusual cheesecake is always my dessert of choice for our New Year's Eve dinner party, and so I chose this intriguing recipe for New Year's 2001, following the recipe exactly (but eliminated the sauce, which seemed superfluous). It was by far the most stupendous cheesecake of my dessert 'career'. My teenage son, who would have rebelled if he knew about the figs, devoured a huge slice - more than compensating for my adult guests who opted for more modest portions. Very rich, lovely to behold, and delightful in its complexity of flavors. The figs impart a strudel-like motif to the crust layer. The sour-cream topping uses only half the amount I'm used to, but is sufficient once the final decorations are added, and makes a lovely thin white layer above the cream-colored slices. It surprises me that so few on this site have tried this recipe - it's sure to invite lavish praise.

This cheesecake was fairly easy to make and the end result is very impressive. The combination of flavors is wonderful; unlike some others, I did make the sauce and found it added another dimension. Next time I will reduce the sugar in the sauce a bit, though, as it was too sweet.

This has become a sort of Christmas tradition in our family. The cheesecake is wonderfully moist and the taste combination is really great. I usually omit the sauce. The cheesecake is great on its own, and the sauce doesn't add anything.

L. Seed from Ottawa, Canada. I have made numerous exotic cheesecakes, mostly from Bon Appetit, but this particular cheesecake (along with a baklawa cheesecake from an issue several years back) is extraordinary and not particularly difficult to make. It is a good idea to start making it two days ahead of when you will need it, but the results will be worth it.
