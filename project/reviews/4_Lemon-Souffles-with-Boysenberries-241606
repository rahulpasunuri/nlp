Excellent and easy make ahead recipe. You won't disappoint!

These are a surprisingly good make ahead dessert. I prepared these right before guests arrived and left them in the fridge while we had dinner. They baked in the oven after the mains and turned out great. I used strawberry jam and strawberries instead, mainly because they were the only options available but could easily see how great these would be with blackberries. I followed others advice and decreased the amount of sugar by about a third (tasting as I went along). It was the perfect sweetness this way. You definitely wouldn't want more!

The recipe was made and was served at a gourmet dinner party for 25 people. It was a huge success. The guests were scraping the bottom of their dishes for that last little drop, and they were wishing that there was another one to take home!

Unnecessarily sweet. To help balance the pudding, I had to add more lemon juice (total of 8T). However, by adding so much sugar to the egg whites, the balance was thrown off again once combined. The jam just sent it over the top! Very easy to do. Made them ahead of dinner and they held up nicely for me (even in a long car ride to a friend's). Put them in the fridge for a couple of hours then baked them off. They puffed perfectly!

i substituted blackberries and raspberries for the boisenberries. these were very good when i made them. they didnt puff as much as i would have liked, and they were a little sweet for my taste. but they were overall very good

Worthy of a desert for Christmas dinner IF you add vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!!!

This is an easy elegant dessert. I used Blackberry jam in the bottom of the ramekins and covered the bottom of ramekins with berries. They puffed up and browned nicely, but I did give them a couple extra minutes. A wonderful dessert for our home-grown blackberries!

Using a little whipping cream when I served it helped to balance the lemon and blackberries. The sauce that it made on the bottom made it better too. This is definitely a food that gets better with each bite!

I loved it! Great flavor and it cooked through. It did not rise as I had hoped, but that may be due to my crazy oven. I added 2 more egg whites and used the same amount of egg yolks. I also used blackberries instead of boysenberries. I highly recommend this recipe over the other lemon souffles listed.

Very good. For any of you who, like me, contemplate making one big souffle: double the cooking time. Also, frozen berries worked just fine.

This was fantastic. I could not find boysenberries so I substituted blackberries and raspberries ( I put 3 of each in each ramekin) and used a blackberry-raspberry jam. I agree with the comments about them having golden edges but a little undercooked/underpuffed. I baked 2 batches and found that they rose much better with the oven rack lower-middle in my oven instead of the middle setting. I made these for Easter and served them with a dollop of homemade french vanilla ice cream to a picky crowd. I was stunned that they disappeared so quickly. Everyone raved.

DELICIOUS!! I used frozen blackberries but used a few more than recipe calls for. I also made a blackberry syrup (blackberries simmered in water and sugar,strained and thickened with cornstarch) I put the sauce in a gravy boat and let each guest crack open their souffle and add sauce as desired. Everyone raved.I made these three hours before guests arrived , refrigerated and then baked them while we ate dinner. They were perfect. A beautiful and delicious Easter dessert.

I made this recipe for a dinner club and everyone loved the souffles. I followed the recipe and agree that substituting other fruit flavors is a good idea and an easy change. I did wait to bake the souffles about 3 hours and they were not runny at all.

A real hit at a ladies' luncheon, but I bet the guys would love it too. I gave it the 14 minutes in a 400 degree oven, but will add a couple of minutes next time or watch for the souffles to rise a bit more. They had golden spots on edges, but were somewhat runny on inside. Instead of boysenberries, I used frozen raspberries and raspberry preserves with all the seeds. What's wrong with seeds? It's amazing how many "gourmet" points you get by presenting individual souffles for dessert!

Fairly easy to make. Wondeful presentation. Found it to be a bit too sweet - but it may have been the jam.

This souffle reminded me of the Salzburger Nockerl my brother and I enjoyed at Gasthaus zur goldenen Ente while traveling in Austria. The small ramekins are the perfect size to ensure the egg is thoroughly baked. They also create a perfectly puffed, fluffy top which is really pretty served with powdered sugar. I placed the ramekins on a low rack in the oven so the tops would not overly brown. My husband and I even enjoyed them cold for breakfast the next morning...it's just fruit and eggs, right :)
