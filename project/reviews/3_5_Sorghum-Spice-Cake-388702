The previous reviewer was right - the bake times are not right on this. My cake already tested done at the 40 minute point when I opened the oven to put the topping on. I baked 10 more min to brown the topping and then turned off the oven and left it 5 more minutes. The topping needed more time but I didn't want to overdo the cake. I used sour milk instead of buttermilk - a great way to use it up. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup since we were eating it with ice cream, and I used dark molasses instead of sorghum, since it's what I had. Nice dense cake; my molasses overwhelmed the spices - should have used more with the heavier taste molasses would give. Served the cake with rum raisin gelato. Mmmmm.

I have loved sorghum molasses since I was a child, so I was very excited to find this recipe. Since there were no previous reviews, and since I'm not the world's best baker, I followed the recipe as is, except that I added the topping at 35 minutes instead of 40, and then only baked it for 20 minutes longer rather than the 25-30 the recipe called for. The Mr. and I agreed it could have still used a little less time in the oven. Still, I served it to a group of foodies who are quite particular (and honest)about their food,and I got rave reviews! It was truly delicious, even with the edges ever-so-slightly overdone. Next time, I will use more sorghum (3/4 cup or maybe even 1 cup), and will add the topping at 30 minutes and then bake the extra 20. Probably add some cinnamon to the topping as well. This is a very light cake, not too sweet, not overly spiced. I served with rum raisin ice cream for my guests, and vanilla for me since I don't do raisins. The combination was perfect, the ice cream and cake really enhanced each other. If, like me, your attempts at homemade cakes don't normally go well, give this one a try. It's a keeper, and will be one of my go-to desserts for the future.
