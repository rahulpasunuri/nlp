I made only the shawarma and onion part of the recipe and they were very good. The meat is spicy but not hot. I cut down the tumeric in half as I am not fond of its strong taste but my husband complained that there was still too much in it (and he likes tumeric).I had lots of the spice mix left over. I definitely would serve this with tehina. Shawarma in Israel is made with turkey and spices as well and this is a very good version of the shawarma sandwiches we buy here, where you can choose from a large variety of items that you put in your pita with it; from tehina to all different fresh vegetable salads and pickles. However, I have never seen oiled pitas used before with shawarma - that is never done.

Showstopping flavour! I'd say no to the pickles - there were all ready too many exciting, bold flavors going on and the pickles were simply too much. (I wasn't keen on the flavour combo either). I did put some pickled beets on the side and this complemented the flavour nicely, adding a touch of sweet. For ease of cooking the onion, I threw some toothpicks in the sides of the cut rounds to hold them together on the grill. It's a keeper!

Such a good dish! We have it a couple times a month at our house. I had some at a local place yesterday (http://imunchie.com/liorhartenstein/munchies/shawarma-firenze) and it was incredible! Definitely worth digging in to!

Excellent dish. Easy and tasty. I've made it twice though, once with the recommended tomato relish (which may as well be salsa) and once with some leftover Tomato Jam from the "Turkey Burgers with Tomato Jam, Olives and Feta" recipe. I highly recommend the Tomato Jam instead. Adds a nice sweetness to the spice of the shawarma.

My husband & I love this recipe! It is quite spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, it is probably not for you. But if you do, yum and yum! We really love the onions and we would rather double them and cut back on the amount of turkey next time. Also, we like it without the pickles because it has a lot going on already, but again, that is a matter of personal taste. I know next to nothing about Israeli or Middle Eastern cuisine, so I cannot speak to this recipe's authenticity (though I doubt turkey is native to the area), but boy, is it good.

I am not a big fan of tahini sauce, but I loved the turkey shawarma with the tomato relish. It was delicious!

SO easy. Considering the time it took to make and the flavors that came from it, I think 4 forks is reasonable. Not the best Shawarma I've ever had, but will definitely make again considering how tasty and easy it was. The store ran out of turkey cutlet, so I used chicken cutlet. used pickles instead of eggplant (I had pickles on hand). Nice ethnic dish.

Ridiculously good. My only suggestion would be to NOT oil the pitas. Just heat them up as-is. They got a little crunchy. Still good, but harder to eat that way.

I made this for 2 with 2 boneless chicken thighs without reading that it serves 8. It makes enough onions for 3 people! They are soooo good. I used half the spice mixture on the chicken and half on the onions so my flavor was bolder and just right. The tomato relish serves 4. I served it with the Quinoa with Grilled Zucchini, Garbanzo Beans, and Cumin from this site because I had made it the day before and it was so good together mmmm. I wasn't going to make this till I read the reviews - so so glad I did. It's like Middle Eastern fajitas or something and the pickles really make it. My tahini seized up when I added the lemon I'd never had that happen so I ended up using all of the boiling water to make it creamy.

All the components were great. Be sure to thin down the tahini sauce as directed and not use right from the jar. It needs to be thinned and have some taste. The only thing I did differently was I warmed my pitas (microwaved briefly) and put the filling inside the pocket, as you'd do for falafel. I found that made the sandwich far easier to eat and softer, less bready and dry.

tasty, easy week-day meal. i used the called-for turkey cutlets and trader joe's prepared tahini sauce. i thought the pickles would be odd - they were delicious! all the flavors paired really well. will definitely make again.

Delicious! Not exactly Israeli flavor, but it was a big hit here and very quick to prepare. I did use the turkey cutlets and thought they were perfect. The only thing I wish is that I had made more of the grilled onions - they're amazing.

This recipe's a keeper. Boneless chicken thighs substitute well & to ease last minute preparation I grilled chicken & onions at the same time & for the same amount of time, heated pitas on top level of grill during the last several minutes of grilling, then quickly sliced chicken & onions, placed on pita on plate - guests added toppings themselves. Really yummy, not quite "souk" shawarma but still very good! Spice mixture's divine - & don't forget to wear rubber gloves when chopping the Serranos.

I used chicken, and it turned out really good. I would only grill the pitas for 1 min a side, 2 was too long. I would reccomend.

We loved it -- all the flavors were great. Only wished for a stronger pickle flavor - next time would add more or buy a heartier brand

Quick, easy and delish! Instead of the Tahini Sauce I made a Tzatziki sauce and marinated for 4 hours. Will definately make again.
