I could make this bread every week and not get tired of it. Its hearty and filling. Not a lot of flavor its perfect for soups or butter and jam.

I just got back from Ireland a week ago, and one of my favorite things was the brown bread that they serve everywhere. Well, this was awesome, but kind of different from what I was expecting. The brown soda bread in Ireland had more of a crumbly, dryer texture than this bread. I followed the recipe exactly. It is crusty, moist, and delicious. I needed to use a bit more buttermilk than called for, probably just due to our dry climate. I baked it for about 10 minutes longer than indicated, and the middle of my loaf was done (baked in a loaf pan). Anyway, I'm not really complaining because the bread is delicious; I just think the texture was a bit different than I remember. Maybe I'll try all whole wheat flour next time and see what happens! I will definitely make it again!

This is absolutely yummy! The next time I make it though I won't use a loaf pan as it didn't cook thoroughly in the center and had to toast the individual slices.

I make an adapted version this recipe. Everyone loves it & it makes 2 loaves which I shape into rounds, cut an "x", baste with milk and top w/oatmeal and it looks beautiful. My Irish Nana said it was most like "home": 4.5 c WWW flour; 1 c oats, 1/2c toasted wheat germ, 1T baking soda, pinch salt, 1 stick butter cut up small and cold, 2 2/3 c buttermilk and a dollop of molasses (no sugar). You may add currants or caraway seeds to the dry / butter mix before the buttermilk. Bake at 424 for 25min or so. Mix the dry, add the butter until looks like crumbs; slowly add buttermilk. Knead a bit w/flour, shape and bake

I have been making this recipe since it was first published. This was published in the May 1996 Bon Appetit issue which was dedicated to Irish cooking. This was and is my favorite issue ever of Bon Appetit! This recipe in particular is perfect. It tastes just like the brown bread in Ireland. I wish I could get my hands on another copy of the magazine as mine is old and dogeared now. I highly recommend having a thick slice of this bread toasted with fresh sweet butter and strawberry jam. Lastly I might add that Irish cooking is very underrated.

A great recipe. I didn't think that the small amount of butter would yield such a moist bread, but it was excellent. This tastes just like the soda bread served to us in B & B's in Ireland last summer. Absolutely wonderful when toasted!

This is an excellent bread recipe. Make sure you test it to make sure it is done in the center. I needed to let it bake approximately 5 more minutes than noted.

I used 100% whole white wheat I ground this morning, on the finest setting of my blendtec, for all of the flour. I didn't have any wheat bran or germ, but I did have oat bran, so I used six tablespoons of that. I didn't bother toasting it. I didn't have buttermilk, so I put two tablespoons of white vinegar in a measuring cup and then added milk to make two cups. I also didn't have any butter, so I added two tablespoons of oil to the milk before I added it to the dry ingredients. I also added a big handful of raisins. SOOOOOOOOO good!

Perfect and easy -- I sub the all-purpose for cake flour, used double the bran in place of the germ...I've been enjoying a slice with butter and a cup of tea every morning!

Fabulous reviews - made this for a St Paddy's day dinner. Used all whole wheat flout, didn't toast the bran/germ. Omitted the sugar and butter. Was quite a moist batter & formed it into two rounds in the hopes it would bake better than one large. Baked for closer to 45-60 minutes.

Delicious and a hit with my whole family. I use 3 tbsp flax meal and 3 tbsp oats with great results. Will definitely be making this regularly!

Great recipe.. I make this every few days - always have a loaf on hand - it's as good as what you would get in a good B&B or restautant in Ireland. Its great toasted with butter and marmalade. It is also so easy to make! I end up increasing whole wheat flour to 2 1/2 cups and thus reduce white flour to 1 cup. So I don't have to have buttermilk on hand, I add 2T vinegar to 1 3/4 c milk - and that works fine.

Our favorite bread, hands down! I add chopped pecans and some flax seed and often substitute molasses or treacle for the brown sugar, mixing it with the buttermilk. I too skip the loaf pan and gently shape it into a round blob on a sprayed cookie sheet. Comes out looking like the wonderful rustic bread I get when in Ireland. Serve up with a Guinness and you are instantly transported there!

This recipe was simple and easy to make and yielded a healthy and tasty bread. I could not find toasted wheat bran at our store but used bulk wheat bran instead. It turned out just fine. I might substitute flax when I make it again.

Very good. I added 1 Tablespoon of ground flax seed as well...liked it so well---made another one so I could use up the remaining 2cups of buttermilk.

We agree with everyone else. This bread is terrific! I made it for the first time on a Sunday, and here it is Friday and I'm making it again! I followed the ingredients list and mixing directions exactly. However, we prefer the rustic round loaf shape (it is REALLY easy to get it into a round shape in the mixing bowl),made slits in the top and sprinkled it with rolled oats. It is baking now and smells terrific. A winner!

I have made this 2 years in a row and it is by far the best soda bread EVER!!! The crust is crunchy but the inside is moist and slightly sweet.

I used white whole wheat flour in place of a.p. flour and used 1/4 c molasses and 1 3/4 c buttermilk. It was delicious!

I just got back from Ireland and was longing for the yummy brown soda bread there. I made this into 4 mini loaves using 3 even scoops of batter (using a standard ice cream disher/scoop) per loaf and baked for 20 minutes. YUM.

This was really great for a quick bread. We do free soup and bread for the community once a week and people were raving about the "new" bread. Will definitely be added to our regular rotation. YUM!

I have made this for the last 3 St Patricks's Days. Always a big hit. This year my son asked that make 2 loaves for his class. Try this with the Potted Crab recipe.

I used another reviewer's suggestion and skipped the loaf pan. The crust was good, but I found the rest of the loaf to be lacking flavour. I'll make this again, but I'm going to double the salt and maybe add more wheat bran. Not a bad recipe, but I think it needs some tweaking.

This bread is our absolutely most favorite. I make two small loaves instead of one large on and freeze the 2nd loaf. It doesn't last in my freezer too long as we have a piece or two toasted every single morning. I make everything as the recipe calls for with the exception that I add at least a cup of chopped dried apricote (not the turkish kind but the kind Trader Joe's sells as slab dried apricots and also a handful of currants. I cut the butter in and then add the fruit in the dry ingredients before I add the buttermilk. You must toast it till it's dark brown and slther with butter. Yummy, Yummy.

I made this last night for St. Patrick's Day to go with a beef and stout stew. My husband and I loved the hearty taste. It was great for breakfast this morning, too--toasted with peanut butter.

Delicious & hearty bread. Family enjoyed it last night with a corned beef/cabbage dinner. I made substitutions as follows: all whole wheat pastry flour for all flour; steel cut oats for wheat germ; fiber one cereal for wheat brean; 1 cup yogurt, 1 cup milk with vinegar for buttermilk; 1 Tbsp Splenda instead of brown sugar. Baked it on a pizza stone 425 for about 27~28 minutes. Very nice crust. Next time, I'll probably sub in flaxseed meal for portion of grain.

A truly wonderful bread for St. Patty's Day dinner or anytime, really. Serve with Kerrigold butter- and thats a must! Cant wait to make this again. Oh, be sure to serve bread warm.

I was cooking dinner without my usual brown soda bread recipe at my mothers house and quickly consulted epicurious to find a replacement to eat that night. This recipe now replaces what I have been using for years. I made a free form loaf. It was so good, people were fighting for the last piece and I had to make another loaf before leaving so my mother would be happy. It is a great hearty bread best that goes great with butter. I will be making this again and again.

After returning from Ireland in Sept., my husband and I both craved the wonderful brown bread we found everywhere over there. I have been making this delicious bread whenever we want to remember Ireland and the wonderful time we had.

Easy Bread perfect for an Irish Dinner! Made free-form loaves.

Delicious exactly as written! Dont change a thing! Try and be patient enough to allow it to sit for one hour before cutting it, the flavor will be even better. We used the back of a tablespoon to smooth and slightly mound the top of the loaf after we put it in the pan. We then made a single lengthwise cut down the middle of the loaf and sprinkled oats on top. When we took it out of the oven, the top had split and risen beautifully with oats on either side of the cut. Our guests did not believe that it was homemade!

I made 3 soda breads this weekend and this was my favorite. Great flavor and texture, and very easy to make.

Great whole grain bread. Very easy. Agree with comment below to use free-form round loaf rather than loaf pan - makes great crust.

Actually, when I first tasted this bread-direct from the oven-I was not impressed. But as it cooled, the flavors became more pronounced. I served it with a cassoulet last night and it complemented the dish well. I added some dark molasses to the dough, as I prefer a sweeter bread, but with a little bite, too. I will defineitely make this again. It is perfect for winter "comfort food" and it is great as toast!

This is one of my favs. A tasty albeit a heavy bread. I like to make this bread as part of a St. Patricks Day dinner and serve it with a beef stew and potatoes. As soon as the bread cools and the meal is over, I freeze the remaining bread with excellent results.

This is a WONDERFUL soda bread. Has a touch of sweetness but it pairs well with both sweet and savory toppings. I served it with clam chowder as well as for breakfast with peanut butter and jam. Also EXCELLENT on its own. Great texture and very nutritious. I cant wait to bake it again and tell my friends about it! So easy too!

A fabulous soda bread. Great crust, and it lasted in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap and tin foil for quite awhile. Very easy to make, and absolutely delicious with a cream of vegetable soup. The first time I made this bread, I forgot to add the brown sugar - and it still turned out delicious. I have since added millet and flaxseed, and this bread can't be beat. I'm about to try it with a substitution of molasses for part of the buttermilk.

I liked baking this in the pan rather than on a bake sheet as someone else suggested; I think it would have been too dry. And I also substituted oatmeal for the wheat germ. Great with honey on the sliced bread!

I made this bread to go with our Irish Dinner and it got raves from everyone. Didn't have wheat bran so I used oat bran. I shaped it like the cook from Massachusetts recommended and baked it on my pizza stone. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use a little corn meal on the stone before placing the bread dough on it. My bread stuck to the stone and I literally had to pry if off. But, what a delicious bread with the crunchiest crust ever. Can't imagine doing it any other way.

We all really liked this bread - even my finicky 5 year old. I substituted oat bran for the wheat bran and cooked it a couple minutes longer than the recipe called for. Served with Irish stew. Delicious!

this bread reminded me of the brown bread we found in the pubs of ireland. served with a pureed vegatable soup which i had added cream to it was a wonderful meal.

Excellent soda bread for whole-grain lovers. Very quick and easy but with lots of flavor. The only change that I suggest is when baking it,instead of using a loaf pan, shape it into a circle, about one to two inches thick, make 1/2 deep slashes in the form of a cross on the top and cook it on a baking stone. Using the loaf pan, only the top of the bread got a wonderful thick, crunchy crust. Also, it was just a bit wet in the middle. Shaping it and using the baking stone should give it a uniform crust and make sure that the middle is cooked through.
