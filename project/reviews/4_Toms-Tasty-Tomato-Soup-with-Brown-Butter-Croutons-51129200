I subbed chicken stock for the water, and wish I'd thought to cut the salt. It's not inedible, but it's pretty salty. This would be lovely with some basil olive oil drizzled on top. Will definitely make again.

Easiest soup to make, and extremely tasty to boot. Looking for something different for these cool January mites, and this is a nice change from Chicken Noodle

Simple, quick - delicious. I made this w/o the croutons, used chicken stock instead of water, and half in half instead of cream. The spicing was spot on for us, but I would probably back off on the red pepper if I was making this for kids.

Very tasty, but, for my kids at least, too spicy. Tried it again with a LOT less crushed red pepper flakes and they loved it. Very creamy; had no idea you could make tomato soup at home, and I don't think I'll ever eat it from a can again. The croutons were incredible; my kids want me to make them instead of potato chips for their lunch.

Hearty, tasty soup. I subbed chicken broth for the water - felt the water would not add to any richness. Used fresh oregano. And my immersion blender instead of taking out portions to put in regular blender. I would recommend adding more broth/water - as the soup cooled, it thickened up considerably - became more like sauce than soup - your mileage may very, but I would say more broth. Made the croutons out of pumpernickel bread, very tasty, indeed! All in all, savory and filling.
