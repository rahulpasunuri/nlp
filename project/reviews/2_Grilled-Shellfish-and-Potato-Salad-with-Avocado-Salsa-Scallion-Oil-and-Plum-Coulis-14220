Just a review on the Scallion Oil. I wanted to use it with some ready-made crab cakes but it turned out to be REALLY bitter tasting... to the point where I just couldn't use it. I ended up piping some avocado mayonnaise and using some old pasta tomato sauce instead.

My husband and I both found this quite flavourful. We liked the salsa a lot, though I omitted the tomatillo as I didn't have any. Since I also had forgotten about the plum coulis, I winged it with a mango, blackberry & lime coulis which worked well.

In a group of adventurous eaters, this was a unanimous thumbs down--a mess. The ingredients just don't mesh well---there are too many other great salads to ever do this again.

It took a while to do the prep work. It's not easy for the first timer or someone who just started cooking. The taste was overcomming to strong. The salsa was great by it's self. A strange blend of sweet,sour and plain.
