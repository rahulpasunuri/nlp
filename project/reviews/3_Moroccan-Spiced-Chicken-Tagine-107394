For all the reviewers who felt this recipe was too bland, merely DOUBLE the amount of spices. It's a NO-BRAINER. I did this and found the dish to be perfect. Many good recipe books will tell the reader that recipes are written for a "general audience", and to adjust ingredients to their particular taste!!!

This was yummy! Because of allergies I left out the Garbanzo beans. I also substituted whole sauteed chicken breasts (boneless), because that's what I had on hand. Dark raisins went in place of the golden, just a personal preference. I think currants might do well also. I had no zucchini on hand. I sauteed the chicken first, then added the onions until translucent, then the rest of the ingredients, brought to a boil, then simmered. I took the chicken out about 10 minutes before serving and added couscous to the liquid left behind, bringing it to a boil and then turning it off and letting it sit covered for ten minutes. I think it would also go well with a rice pilaf or perhaps quinoa cooked in the same liquid. The spices are very pungent going in, but fairly mellow when all is cooked.I think next time I will increase them, but the original version was just seasoned enough for our second-grader who does not like curry but enjoys saffron and turmeric.

Yes, it needs extra spices. Tasty.

We love this dish. I have made it many times, with some good and some not so good variations. I always double the recipe, so at least one of us can have leftovers.Do not skimp on the tomatoes, and the sundried tomatoes not in oil aren't a good substitute for those packed in oil. I have thrown in dried currants, shredded carrot, subbed 1/2 veggie broth for part of the chicken broth, all turned out great. I suspect some of the reviewers do not date their spices when opening, and are using stale ingredients, or are skimping on them. When I measure out the spices, I put them in a med bowl of almost boiling broth to ensure getting the full flavor. I top with fresh cilantro and sea salt coarsely ground.

Couscous should not be thrown in this dish. You should take a seperate bowl, add liquid to the couscous (1,5 times the amount of couscous) a nut of butter, and put a lid on to let the couscous soak up the liquid. Then serve with the tajine dish. If you still have liquid left over in the dish, take out the veggies and meat, bring to a boil until syruppy. The flavour of this dish is indeed quite mild but still tasty.

I thought this was an excellent dish and would make it again for sure! I don't know why a few people said it was bland, I added some extra spices to be safe and found it so tasty and spicy! I thought it was pretty easy and faster than I thought to make! Here are some changes I made or would suggest for next time! 2 zucchini's - maybe chop instead of shred 1-2 carrots (tried this, very good) doubled the sundried tomatoes doubled the spices (we like spicey) less chickpeas add pinenuts at the end Also try not to double the couscous or if you do, add more water or broth because that stuff soaks up liquid like crazy and you don't want this too dry! Enjoy!

This was very tasty - tons of flavor. I used lightly sauteed, chopped plum tomatoes with a little bit of harissa instead of sun-dried tomatoes (I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes on hand, and I wanted to add more flavor and spice with the harissa). I'd go a little lighter on the garbanzos next time. I didn't use chicken broth - I lined the bottom of the tagine with chopped 1 large chopped onion. This, along with other natural juices, created enough liquid to create the correct texture. I added ~a cup of shredded carrots as well, which was a tasty addition (also added color and texture). I sprinkled the chicken with a little cinnamon, and added 2 small cinnamon sticks on top of the whole mixture before placing in the oven. Definitely recommend this recipe, very flavorful!

I made this last night and hadn't read the reviews first, having been given a print out of the recipe with a holiday gift of saffron. I thought it was pretty great the way it was (though I had used bullion for my chicken stock so maybe that helped). No complaints on lack of spice at all. Agree that pine nuts would be a great addition for next time, but thought the amount of chicken was fine - nice to have a meat dish that wasn't all about the meat.

This recipe provides a great weekday meal without a lot of work. Do increase the spices as other reviews say. The raisins were key - my husband who doesn't even like raisins said they were his favorite part of the dish as their sweetness pops against the savory spices. Even though I only rated it a 'good', I'd love to make it again, experimenting with different spices and veggies.

After reading the other reviews I doubled up on the spices except for the saffron. I also added my often used secret ingredient - a Knorr chicken bullion cube. I know, its mostly MSG but it really adds a zing to dishes like this. I also cooked the couscous separately using juices from the chicken and used fresh Garbanzo beans which are wonderful - I find mine at Winco (!) and used whole thighs. I liked it and found it to be a good way of using up some of those old Mideast spices hanging around in the pantry.

I hated this. It turned into a bland, mushy mass. My husband did like it, but I don't plan to make it again.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. It is so easy and delicious. It also makes great leftovers. It definitely needs some modifications, as we found it a bit bland the first time. We added about a tablespoon of salt and that really helped. We also doubled the amount of raisins and all the spices (except the saffron, which we find doesn't add much). We also add about 1/4-1/2 cup more chicken broth as the first time was too dry.

This reipe was fantastic. My dinner party was in heaven. I advise to use a little more chicken. One guest was a vegitarian and I made hers seperate with eggplant instead of chicken and it was great.. A winner

A winner, just spicy enough and so very tasty. A real keeper.

EASY and elegant, yet down to earth and hearty. I served it with roasted moroccan spiced vegetables. A hit!

How can any reviewer call this recipe bland? Look at the list of spices. While it may not be fiery, it is certainly not bland. I changed the recipe by placing whole, not boneless thighs, chick peas and the spices in a tagine (a Moroccan clay cooking pot.) I cooked the couscous separately, and had a delicious dish I will make again.

Too bad I can't select zero forks. Bland Bland Bland. Unsalvagely bland. Too bland for us, to spicy for the cat. We'll see how the racoons like it.

This dish was very bland. My family ate it without many complaints, but I can always tell if a recipe I prepare is a hit when my husband says, "you can make this again". He actually told me I should get rid of this recipe.

I find this recipe nonfunctional, and would have written it differently. To tell not only the wheretofores but WHYS of your procedure. It seems to me that your timing is off, missing 20 minutes between the lst and 2nd steps. My husband is a professional and he too was confused by its oversimplification. What a waste of time and money.

Very easy, very tasty. My husband and my 2 year old loved it. That is a very good sign. Very good as left overs as well.

Wow! What a wonderful one-pot meal. I thought it was perfect. The only thing I changed was adding a bit more meat, because it was there!

This is very good. milder than I expected. The only thing that I changed is that I used more chicken, and less garbabzo beans. With the sprinking of cilantro I also added pine nuts.Emily If you have any left over, add a little chicken broth--makes a lovely soup.
