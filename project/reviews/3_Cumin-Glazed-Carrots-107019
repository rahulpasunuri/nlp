Great side dish. Nice color and the combination of flavors was interesting without distracting from the main dish.

Maybe just didn't do it for me, roasted carrots are a lot easier and taste better!

Excellent dish! I served them as a lukewarm side dish to a meal of falafel and my guest and I enjoyed it very much. I used cumin seeds instead of powdered cumin, which I crushed in a mortar with a small clove of garlic. Loved it.

As the cook before said, this is a perfectly good side dish (but really worthy of 2 1/2 forks); great way to vary up a plain vegetable. I made as directed; doubled and served as one of three sides for a beef tenderloin buffet for 12--what I REALLY like is that this can be served room temp and thus a real last-minute hero when entertaining.

This is a perfectly good side dish. I make it with Chinese Five-Spice powder instead of cumin. I also use brown sugar instead of honey and rarely add lemon. It is easy to make and tasty. A simple, good way to cook a common vegetable.

I've actually made this dish four or five times and people are always impressed. It's a really great Indian side dish and goes well with vindaloos, madras, tikka-- you name it. Last time I made it I walked into the kitchen and a friend was standing there eating carrots straight out of the pan!

Delicate and well balanced. Easy to make and tasty. Even my carrot-hater liked it. I'll make it again.

I liked the glazed texture and the sweetness, but the cumin didn't do anything for me. Would make it again, but maybe using cinnamon or allspice.

I thought this recipe was very uninspiring. Some of our guests liked it so I would consider making it just for a variation on plain old carrots.

This was OK for a one time change of pace for your carrots, but although I really like cumin, it just didn't seem to go with this dish. Edible but not memorable

This was an easy, fast and flavorful dish! Excellent way to spice up your veggies! I served them at room tempture which turned out great. Served it with Jerk Chicken (found here), but would be good with roast chicken or other roasted/grilled meats.

Very nice addition to my repertoire, especially for those of us whose refrigerator at times yields no vegetable for a side dish but carrots. Sauteeing the cumin first (as directed) gives the carrots a lovely character, and the black pepper gives it a kick. I didn't need the entire 20 mins. prescribed, but watched it closely until the glaze was ready but the carrots were still al dente. I made it ahead, too, and will make it often. (It stood up beautifully to, and complimented, a porcini chicken saute and mashed potatoes.)
