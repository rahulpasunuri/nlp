I have always hated beets. But hubby loves them. Since we met/married 6 years ago, our agreement has been that he try whatever I cooked. So, in fairness, I decided to try the beets in this recipe. Roasting made the difference. I must admit that it takes the total combination for me to like them, but it works for me. I will make this again.

What onion?? It says toss watercress and onion and I can't find any onion in the recipe!

Served as first course. Lots of compliments. Followed recipe closely and used the day ahead recommendations. I recommend that you dress the watercress at the last moment to avoid wilting. Goat cheese was divine and super simple to prepare.

Best beet salad on the planet and our family-favorite holiday salad. We've tried probably a dozen beet salad recipes over the years but this one is far and away the best. It's super easy and can be made in advance so it is perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas. Much better and easier than the molded beet and pistachio salad (also on this site). This one is a total winner!

I don't even like beets and I thought this was delicious! (beets arrived in our veg delivery this week so had to use them somehow). I roasted some shallots along with the beets (adding them halfway thru the beet time) and toasted some pecans to put on top (ideas from other recipes) -- I would definitely do this again as they both added a lot to the final result. I also used fresh tarragon (don't care for the dried). Fantastic and different, husband raved too!

I used an already-herbed goat cheese, and made a "crust" for the cheese of toasted hazlenuts and fresh tarragon. I also used fresh tarragon in the vin., and put a few extra nuts in too, that were leftover from the crust. All in all, it was very, very fresh and tasty and savory and beety. The vin. was fine--the true stars are the beets and the goat cheese, but I suppose they might be too center- stage without the greens, etc.

I have made this recipe almost every Thanksgiving since it was published in 1994. It has become a family tradition and is a wonderful way to kick off a holiday (or other special occasion meal). Worth the effort.

Roasting the beets was tedious BUT worth it - yummy! Lovely salad very suitable for company. I used arugula as well, only because I had it on hand, and served with sliced, grilled duck breast for a one-plate meal. The tarragon really adds a nice flavor to the cheese rounds and the dressing. Will definitely make again soon, probably tonight with the left over beets I have! Enjoy!

I made this with arugala instead of watercress and added some toasted pine nuts for crunch. Very tasty. The freshly roasted beets are what make the salad particularly delicious.

I loved it. The goat cheese was great.

This was great. Light but sweet from the roasted beets. Was a great hit. Try it with a nice pino noir-seems strong but the beets and the goat cheese help to carry the wine.

I love this recipe. I've made it for several Thanksgiving dinners, and it is always enjoyed. It's also my way to sneak in some roasted beets, which I love. As a side note, I enjoy the typo in the recipe that tells you to bring the cheese to "toom" temperature... mmm... crypt cheese!

This is very good. Everything can pretty much be done ahead of time (beets, vinegarette, cleaning watercress and prepping goat cheese). Very easy to do and makes for a nice presentation. Thinly sliced red onion gets tossed with the watercress.

This is a great salad. I prepared the beets the night before, as I think they are best at room temp or chilled. I halved the recipe and it worked beautifully. Highly recommend if you like the ingredients.

Delicious salad, although I had to tweek the dressing. I added a little more olive oil, then a pinch of sugar at the end. I also tossed in about ½ cup red onion (thinly sliced on a mandoline) with the mezclun, which I used in the place of watercress.

I do this alot! A hit with everyone all the time.

The best and easiest salad I've found! Easy to prepare ahead, and the guests raved. Finding enough fresh non-wilted watercress was a challenge, so I mixed with green leaf lettuce.

I loved it! I used mixed greens instead of watercress, and because it was valentine's day I cut the beets and the goat cheese into hearts. It was a big hit.

this salad is fabulous! Red onions is the answer to the previous reader. i have substituted green leaf lettuce for watercress with excellent results.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I see there are onions in the directions, but not the ingredient list. What kind and how much?
