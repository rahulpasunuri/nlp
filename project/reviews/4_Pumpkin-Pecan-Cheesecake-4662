Oh and a suggestion for those whose pans leak, go buy some cooking bags, you know the kind you would never put a roast in and use like they intended it be used? Put your springform pan in the bag, roll the sides down so that they are just below the top of your pan, trim if needed, and voila, no leaking pan!

This is a fantastic recipe but I do have a few changes I use. The praline is a bit touchy however, so I usually plan on 2 batches as that seems to be what it takes to get it right for me, no clue why but the first batch never seems to bubble, just dries out. Regardless the cheesecake is fantastic, everyone loves it. I have made it a number of times over the years and it is always a hit. I sometimes use a mix of white and brown sugar instead of all white. I upped the vanilla to 1 T instead of 1t. I increase all the spices by about 50% & I also usually add about 1/4t cloves to the mix. Making it again this year for Christmas dinner.

This is an easy, excellent recipe that everyone loves. My only caveat would be to make sure you have a really good springform pan with a tight fitting bottom. Both times I made it, the water bath leaked a little and the crust was soggy, even though I wrapped it with foil very tightly. I substituted rum for bourbon with no problem. And skipped making the praline--just piped some whipped cream around the sides and topped with pecans. The cheesecake is light and creamy-- perfect for the season! Enjoy.

I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving for the last 5 years--with a couple of minor adjustments. I double the praline--nibble on a bit and really mound it on the cheesecake--no complaints yet. And I make it in a 10" spring form pan. There is so much filling that even with the larger pan it fills it right to the top. Absolutely delicious.

I discovered this recipe five years ago--it's involved, but so worth it. Picture perfect, and absolutely scrumptious. I've made it every Thanksgiving since. This year I'm making it for Christmas since my brother has never had the pleasure and he loves both pumpkin and cheesecake. It never fails.

Hold the phone, kids... If you really want to make this spectacular: Done't put the pralines on just yet. Serve each piece with a dollop of freshly whipped cream. Cut open a fresh vanilla bean and use a dash of cardamom and about a teaspoon or so of sugar and beat into the cream. Then top the whipped cream with a sprinkling of the pralines. WOW! Fantastic!

Oh and a note, instead of double wrapping the pan in foil for the water bath, use a roasting bag, put the pan in it and roll it back or trim and you have a waterproof way to put the pan in the water bath.

I first made this recipe many years ago when I got the copy of Bon Appetite and it was a hit. Sadly I lost the recipe afterwards. I was thrilled to find it again here and have made it a few times since and it is always a hit. I have had some problems with the praline so I always plan on 2 batches just in case to get it right, for some reason some batches just seem dry and never bubble. Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly except I taste for spices and usually up them a bit. Fantastic recipe.

When I purged my old Bon Appetit magazines last year, I saved the page with this recipe. I could tell it would be delicious, and it was! Just made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. My picky father-in-law even announced that it should be the new tradition every Thanksgiving. I made it exactly as directed in the recipe, sans bourbon since I didn't have any in the house. It came out beautifully, no cracks. Made it the day before Thanksgiving so it would have time to settle. Kept the praline in a sealed container to put on at the last minute. Definitely use a food processor for the crust; crushing all those hard gingerbread cookies with a mallet is nearly impossible! Loved it. It will be my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving from now on.

Quick way to do the pecan praline: Don't do it the day before. Instead, take the cheesecake out 15 mins early, remove the bag, and then spread the uncooked praline mixture evenly over the top of the cheesecake. Bake the final 15 minutes. This is my family's favorite dessert during the holiday season!

Rating: 4
This is a perfect and impressive holiday dessert. Instead of a water bath, I fill a large roasting pan with water and place it on the rack directly below the cheesecake. Very simple and works perfect, not a single crack and very smooth texture. Also bakes about 15 - 20 min faster. Substitutions: graham crackers, 2 lowfat and 2 regular cream cheese packages, apple juice instead of Bourbon, 3 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of ginger and cinnamon and only 1TBsp of flour. NOTE: The recipe requires a 10 inch pan. Served with fresh whipped cream with cinnamon. Everyone LOVED it and wanted the recipe.

First cheesecake ever and it was EXCELLENT! Here are the modifications I made which seemed to be perfect: 1)scrapped the praline topping all together-the cheesecake was excellent by itself; 2)added about 1-2 tbsp of extra butter for crust-it seemed a little dry to me as written; 3)used 1/2 low fat cream cheese; 4)no bourbon; 5) close to double the cinnamon and ginger; 6) added approx 1/4 c. of pumpkin butter just bec I had it. Will make again and again-rave reviews from everyone.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had. My guests were swooning and asking for thirds. It is also huge and rich and could easily feed 20. I used a regular graham cracker crusts as I had the graham crackers in the pantry but would definitely try the gingersnaps next time. I also made a walnut praline as I had them already, and that worked out well, but frankly it would be delicious with or without the praline. Also, used whiskey instead of bourbon because I am not a bourbon fan.

Rating: 4
I've been making this recipe regularly since it first appeared in Bon Appetit in 1997, and I always get positive responses. My own family is only too happy with the bourbon taste and the alcohol, but I live too far from family to go home for Thanksgiving, and have been invited several times to homes where people don't drink because of religious beliefs. I just substitute apple juice, and it turns out fine.

This recipe was such a hit that everyone "gobbled" it up at Thanksgiving dinner and chose this over all the regular deserts. They said it was AMAZING!!! I have to say I was very confused by the idea of "bathing" the cheesecake vs. baking it in the oven. I am not a very patient person and saw little results in the "Bath" so I proceeded to keep it in the "bath" and place it in the oven for 1 hour and 45 min. at 325. No cracking, no leaking, springform pan used with two layers of aluminum foil around and underneath and placed inside a corningware baking dish with the hot water. Simply AMAZING!!! Will make every year and probably for other special occasions. I'm not a drinker so was hesitant about the Bourban, but it added excellent flavor! God bless!

Rating: 0
Thanks to the oven roaster bag idea! Definitely easier and more water proof than the foil. I made a couple adjustments to the filling: for spices I used 1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon. I didn't have bourbon so I used applejack brandy. Tasted great!

I've reviewed this recipe before, so I just wanted to update with a substitution I made last week that *didn't* work - I accidentally bought fat free cream cheese. The taste was still pretty good, but the cheesecake cracked badly despite the water bath, and the texture was off. I just made the recipe correctly today (third time), with perfect results.

I just made 3 of these for a 100 person dinner party and they literally flew off the dessert table. They were massive cheesecakes but absolutely delicious. The praline was perfect (I probably ate half of it before it even went on the cheesecake) and cheesecakes had a great consistency. I heard many exclamations of "I think this is the best thing I have ever eaten." I will definitely make this recipe again.

I tried this for Canadian Thanksgiving this year. It was...good. But not great. I found that the bourbon flavor was too strong, and the texture was less creamy than other recipes (3 TBS of flour is significant for a cheesecake!). I would strongly recommend the Bourbon Pumpkin Cheesecake, found on this site, instead (incidentally, it uses only 1/3 the bourbon that this recipe does).

Rating: 3
I will try the oven bag trick, or no water bath at all. The leakage caused my crust to be softer than desired, but nobody but me seemed to care. The cake was delicious and will be made again. I also used jack daniels, added 1/2 cup small pecan pieces to the crust. The batter did make too much, but I just baked the excess in a small greased loaf pan - pumpkin quantity could probably be reduced a little to avoid the excess

This is a very good cheesecake recipe, and the tip about using an oven roasting bag around the bottom is genius. A tasty alternative to pumpkin pie for the holidays - but like all cheesecakes, it's so big and so rich that you will be eating the leftovers for a while!

Help for cooking cheescakes in a water bath... Just thought I'd like to solve a problem that I'm sure many have had when cooking cheesecakes in water baths. I found that by placing the cheesecake in an oven roasting bag and folding down the edges so as not to allow steam to drip on the cake solved the foil leakage problem. No need to wrap the pan in foil, just place in the bag and go. I've done this exclusively with all my cheesecakes and never had a problem. This hint I submitted to another cooking site and the owner wrote back and featured it as a permanent tip for her cheesecake recipes. Good luck!

Rating: 3
Echoing many others I found this to be an easy and attractive cheesecake to make, very festive for the holidays or special if it isn't a holiday! I tripled wrapped the aluminum foil and had slight leakage but most of the crust remained crunchy. About the crust, the one change I made was to use Speculos (Ginger Snaps are hard to come by in France) and they worked VERY WELL. I didn't add any cinnamon b/c there is already cinnamon in the cookie. I will only make this with the Speculos in the future. It goes perfectly with this cheesecake.

This was the first time I ever made a cheesecake, ever. It was the best but I used Jack Daniels instead of Bourban. It made the pumpkin taste better. I was so proud of myself.

Everything about this recipe was off. First of all the amount of batter is at least half again as much as will fit in the 9 inch pan recommended. I've made several cheesecakes with ginger-snap cookie crust and none came out like this one, like a moist rubbery cookie instead of a crumbly crust. Thirdly, the pecan praline burned in the pot and burned again in the oven, simply following the instructions. In eight minutes I would've had ashes, as it was in three I had a smoky ruined mess.

Great cheesecake! First cheesecake I've ever made that didn't crack...not even a little...it was perfect looking. HOWEVER, while I thought the seal b/w the foil and the pan was tight, it wasn't and water leaked through. This made the outside of the cheesecake a little bit soggy and I was so worried. But, you couldn't even tell when you were eating it. The pecan praline makes this special. Not only does it taste good, it really dresses up an otherwise plain-looking cheesecake. I doubled the spices and because I didn't have any burbon, I subbed 2T of rum and added an extra T of vanilla. It was a hit!

Rating: 4
I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the cream cheese mixture. I served it with cinnamon whipped cream piped around the edge and put the crunch on top and in the center. The praline crunch made this recipe stand out. It got rave reviews and I plan on making it instead of pumpkin pie this year for Thanksgiving.

My wife and I made this a couple times and everyone loves it. I would definitely make it again, its delicious. The only tricky part is making sure that the foil creates a good seal around the springform pan. If water gets in, it makes the crust soggy - it still tastes wonderful but doesn't look as good.

I made this for an office holiday party. Pumpkin pastries and cheesecakes aren't very common here, but everyone loved this. The taste is subtle, with just enough play between the pumpkin, bourbon, and spices. I thought it could use more pralines though. Even though it seems like you end up with a ton of pralines, the amount per serving seemed less than generous.

I made this cheesecake for the first time this weekend. I am known among my friends as "the Cheesecake Lady" but this one topped any others I have made in the past. I made it exactly as the recipe directed. I only used a small amount of praline on the top and felt it was just enough. I made a spiced whipped cream (added cinnamon and ground ginger) and piped a border around the top to frame the praline topping. This recipe is incredible and I will definitely make it again!

I have made this recipe about 3 times and it just keeps getting better. The first time I substituted the gingersnap crust for a graham cracker crust and it was excellent. I do love the bite of the gingersnap crust though and highly recommend it. I haven't had any problems with water leakage or my pans being ruined - I did follow directions carefully and it's consistently come out well each time. People RAVE about this cheesecake and I make it every Fall.

This was really good. I noticed that some water had seeped into my foil layers, but it didn't seem to make the crust soggy. After reading what a previous reviewer said about ruining her roasting pan, I did the bain marie in a disposable aluminum roaster. At serving time I sprinkled the praline on the side of each slice rather than on top of the whole thing. Delicious, but almost too sweet when combined with the richness of the cheesecake. The bourbon is very subtle; we could barely taste it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out fine, but boring. It just wasn't rich enough. I'm not sure what to do to make it more exciting. I'll look for a different pumpkin cheescake recipe. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, it didn't fit in my pan. I was able to make 2.

This is a winner--just delicious! I added a dash of nutmeg after tasting the batter, and liked the addition. I made the cheesecake/praline 1 week ahead (froze praline in a freezer bag, cheesecake still in the pan). I took them out of the freezer 3 hours prior to serving. {Note: I doubled the recipe and used an 8" and 9" pan--have another in the freezer for Thanksgiving!}

I loved the recipe, but ruined my roasting pan by putting alluminum and water in it for the water bath. My pan is blackened except for the circle where the springform pan was. Grrrr. Not happy about this. Other than ruining the pan the cheesecake was good and the topping excellent.

The flavour of the cake was really nice - i brought it to a thanksgiving dinner & everyone was very impressed. My only complaint is that the recipe should state that the filling should be beaten JUST until mixed. I ended up overbeating - i noticed that volume seemed to increase suddenly, & it ended up not all fitting in the springform. Consequently, the cake ended up cracking because of the increased air in the filling. Luckily the praline hid the cracks & nobody would have even known they were there!

I've now made this recipe twice for seasonal get-togethers around the Thanksgiving/Christmas holidays and every time I've made it I get tons of compliments and a lot of recipe requests! Now many of my friends and family have made it as well - always to rave reviews! I would highly recommend it for anytime you have to bring the dessert!

Each Thanksgiving I make this cheesecake for my extended family and each time its a hit! This time before baking I sprinkled a little cinnamon and nutmeg on the top before baking and also cooked it for an extra half hour. The result is a firmer texture in the middle and a more well done appearance on top of the cake. The finished product looks and tastes more like a New York style cheesecake. We love it and will continue to use this recipe for years to come.

This is the perfect holiday cheesecake. I read the reviews about the bourbon taking away some of the flavor of the pumpkin, so I decided to compensate by adding some cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to the pumpkin. The flavor was fantastic and the compliments to the chef were endless.

A very pretty cheesecake but I was hoping for a more pronounced pumpkin flavor. I've made this twice now, and everyone loves it. The second time, I made it in a 13 x 9 pan, and cut like brownies. I also made a caramel sauce and drizzel over before adding the praline so they would stick since we were eating by hand. Made them better I thought. Over all though, I have better cheesecake recipes (from this site) and if I want pumpkin, I'll make a bread!

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake and it was just beautiful. I baked it in the water bath and I would definitely recommend it. It made the cheesecake firm and didn't sink in the middle when cool. I might try putting the praline on the bottom of the crust next time.

The purpose of the water bath is not to add humidity in the oven. It is to slowly bake the cheesecake at a lower temperature. Because the cake is sitting in a water bath, it is only baking at approx 212 F. It may have worked for some people, but I would not recommend leaving it out on a regular basis. The texture will not be the same.

That tells you how easy it is to make!] I decreased the sugar a lot - I used about one third of what the recipe called for. My boyfriend and I don't like real sweet desserts and I figured that since it had a praline topping, it would compensate... It did! Everyone loved it!

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving feast and it was absolutely wonderful! Plus, though it takes a while to cook, it was really very easy. My guests went crazy for the praline topping. I avoided the bain marie as well and just put two pans of water in the oven with the cheesecase. I reduced the cooking time by about 10 minutes too. Also I live in Denver and sometimes recipes don't work with the high altitude- but no problems with this one. Yuuuuuummmmmy!

I made this cheesecake last year for Thanksgiving because I'm not too fond of pumpkin pie. I was a little concerned about the praline topping as I was serving some Louisiana natives as well. They loved it, especially with some nice Louisiana chickory coffee after dinner! It is fantastic. I did not do the bain-marie. I just baked it at 350 degrees with a bowl full of water in the oven to provide humidity. It didn't crack, and even if it had, the praline would have been on top of it! This cheesecake will definitely become a Thanksgiving tradition.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner to rave reviews. The color of the cake is beautiful. Some with more conservative tastes might want to skip the bourbon as it adds some bite to the taste. HOWEVER, I must stress that if you are not completely conservative in your tastes, you MUST keep the bourbon as it works beautifully with the praline topping. The cake cooks beautifully, without cracks. Those who require crisp crust may quibble, since the bain-marie softens the crust significantly. I, however, heard no complaints. A great recipie!

This is a terrific recipe, and if you skip the bain-marie, it's not a heavy cheesecake at all. The only trick is to take it out of the oven when it's still jiggly in the middle, so that it doesn't dry out. The bain-marie means that the cake is getting steamed, which could make it too heavy.
