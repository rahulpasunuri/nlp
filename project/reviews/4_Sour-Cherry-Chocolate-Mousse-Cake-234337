It is a bit finicky but If you want to take something to a potluck and steal the show, this recipe is a keeper! Just rememeber to keep the ganache separately and pour it once there. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out goodlooking and tasty. I would, however, change the mousse consistancy a little bit because it came out more like jello than what i would've liked, plus more nutella in the mousse would be better also.

This cake is simply Excellent. I have made it several times mainly due to the requests of friends and family members. I follow the recipe as written except for the decoration. I usually either cover the entire cake neatly with the ganache or cover it with a chocolate box: spread melted chocolate on wax papers and wrap them around and on top of the cake. Once the chocolate cools, I peel off the papers and I have a flimsy looking chocolate box filled with great tasting chocolate mousse cake!

Boy howdy, this was some seriously good chocolate stuff! Followed the recipe exactly (with one tiny exception), and the only issue I had was with the cherry layer -- I used a preserve with no pectin, and the sauce never reduced or set up properly, even though I bailed and added a little gelatine to help it. Consequently, the sauce layer bled out (good thing I used aluminum foil on the bottom of the pan). I wound up not unmolding it due to time constraints, and added the ganache layer to it while still in the pan so that it would be chilled by the time we finished eating (I used the amounts listed in the recipe, and did not double as some did). Taste-wise, however, this was stupendous, and a definite keeper. I'll just be sure to read my sour cherry jam labels the next time! I should also note that I used cherry vodka just because I had a few drops still on hand, in place of the brandy.

This cake was very easy to make, in spite of all the steps. The combination of the sour cherry with the chocolate and hazelnuts was great. I doubled the ganache as suggested. Mine didn't turn out quite as pretty as the picture but it definitely tasted good!

Outstanding. Doubled the ganche and followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful !

I think anyone who didn't like this recipe, didn't follow the directions. It's one of my pet peeves that people say "well I replaced this with that and that, and hated the recipe". For the first time I make any recipe, I follow the directions exactly as written. You can then modify it to your personal taste based on experience, not conjecture. As for this recipe, the crispy bottom and sour cherry layer added just the right amount of both taste and texture to balance out the rich mousse. Both the mousse and the Ganache were totally dependent on using the best chocolate you can find. Sorry Hershey's, Nestles', and Baker's. Try to use Sharffen Berger if you can. If you can't find it Ghirardellis will due. This is a time consuming recipe, but the reaction of my guests to both the presentation and intense flavor, have made this a Thanksgiving must.

I had no problems executing the recipe but didn't like the result. First, the mousse was way too rich (not surprising, I guess, since it's made entirely of marscapone, double cream and Nutella). Second, the taste of the Nutella was too faint in the mousse, which tasted mainly of the cream. Third, I couldn't really taste the cherry layer either, again overwhelmed by the cream...the amount for the cherry layer should probably be doubled.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party and it is absolutely fabulous! The sour cherry mixture really improves the recipe. Next time, I will double the ganache; it wasn't enough to drip down the sides. Superb!
