This gravy was fine, but pretty bland. I added in some sage but it didnt do the trick. Keep in mind it will thicken considerably once it starts to cool. Someone gave me an interesting tip for future gravy making. She said she uses boiled egg yolk, mashed up, as a thickener instead of flour. She chops the whites and adds them to the gravy also. I havent tried this yet, but will next time.

I made this recipe, along with the giblet stock, and have never heard such rave reviews on gravy flavor. The only change I made was to add a few hard boiled eggs (chopped) and we prepared the livers separately, chopped & added to finished product.

Great! I actually ended up with almost 2 cups of unused stock - if I'd used it all the gravy would have been way too thin. This is a bit of work, but worth it.

Excellent gravy, with all the right notes--great turkey flavor, texture, and all that. I don't know what was so confusing or difficult about the instructions either--seemed pretty easy to me.

This was a HUGE pain in the neck to make--I found the recipe confusing and the end result just not worth the effort. There are much better gravy recipes on this site.

I added the turkey neck meat to the gravy instead of all the giblets and I left out the burnt pan drippings. The gravy was fantastic. I did make the gravy broth the night before to save time. This is a keeper!
