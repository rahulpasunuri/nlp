If you're having difficulty crushing the peppermint candy, throw them in the food processor -- quicker, less messy -- I learned this trick when making the chocolate/peppermint crackle cookies a few years ago --

While I agree it was hard to smash the peppermint candy, I didn't mind the chunks and neither did my guests. This was completely and totally awesome and I had leftovers that I kept in the freezer and for a couple weeks afterwards could make myself a treat.

Scrumptious! I had a slight difficulty when it came to crushing the peppermints (I tried a hammer and a plastic bag. The mints held up well; the bag didn't). So I took a short cut and used Dreyer's Peppermint Candy Ice Cream instead. It works! I also experimented with both the homemade chocolate sauce and Hershey's sundae syrup. I strongly recommend going with hommemade--it's thicker and much more satisfying. All in all an excellent holiday treat!

A really easy holiday dessert that you can make ahead of time. My first time making profiteroles and working with a pastry bag, and they came out perfect! Everyone raved when I served these for Christmas dinner.
