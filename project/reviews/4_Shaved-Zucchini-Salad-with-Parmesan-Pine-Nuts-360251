Essential that you assemble at the very last minute lest the salad becomes soggy. Zucchini ribbons looked terrific and the Parmesan made the taste fabulous! B.J. Harrick

Excellent! Fresh and different. Does seem to make more dressing than you need. Either add less or drain off when you plate it.

This is the most incredible salad. I agree, if you can, salt the zucchini ahead of time and let it drain. And the amount of dressing is enough for twice the salad. But all of the ingredients add to an amazing taste explosion. Who knew zucchini could be so addicting?

Never knew raw zucchini could taste so good. My only change was to reduce very slightly the amount of olive oil. This is a beautiful and refreshing salad -- something a little out of the ordinary that I'll make again. Nice make-ahead for company, sice the squash can be shaved the day before and chilled.

I made this for first time last night and was debating between it and the shaved summer squash salad. I made this recipe and also followed others' suggestions about letting the salted zucchini sit for an hour and serving the dressing on the side. But since I had arugula in the fridge, I tossed some of that in and it was terrific!

Really nice. I followed the reviewer suggestion to mix the salt with the zucchini and let it sit for a while first (I did it for at least an hour), to get out the excess water content. This worked well. I also made up the dressing in a jar to pass at the table- it's too much dressing for the salad. Also, if they are stored separately, the dressing won't cause the salad to wilt in the fridge. Delicious and refreshing!

very good and different from your average salad. Agree that it becomes too liquidy so use les dressing and put it on right before serving. Willadd grape tomatoes the next time.

This was a huge hit at my house. I will use a touch more lemon next time. Was great left over, too!

Delicious salad though it could probably use about half the dressing. Next time I make this I am going to try to toss the zucchini slices with the salt FIRST and let it drain for a while, as it's not just a lot of dressing, but it gives off a lot of liquid. Otherwise delicious, and I would not omit the pine nuts nor the cheese - they add something special to the flavor. I found that this keeps well in the fridge too, but turns into more of a pickled consistency (which I don't mind).

Made this for some friends and all loved it! I'll be making this often when the garden starts flooding us with zucchini again. A great, fresh idea for zucchini is always welcomed.

easy and fresh. especially useful when tired of steaming or grilling. we prefer it with oregano and a feta based dressing.

Rating: 4
I found this simple and unexpectedly delicious in spite of the favorable reviews I had read. I julienned the zucchini using my mandolin, which I think made it better because it had substance and some crunch. I did not change anything else although I did not measure all ingredients. I highly recommend this for a fast healthy salad even if you dont like salads.

Rating: 4
Great salad, but like other reviewers I recommend keeping the dressing on the side so as not to drown it. I also used feta cheese instead of parmesan. Instead of a peeler I used a mandolin for the zucchini. This recipe worked well with Grilled Leg of Lamb with Rosemary, Garlic and Mustard (Bon Appetit, April 2010).

Followed other suggestions to not use all of the dressing and cut back on the basil just a tad. A quick, easy, and very tasty way to serve a raw veggie, and healthy too! I'm not a huge lettuce/salad fan, so this is my idea of a "green" for the meal without making traditional salad. Don't have a V-slicer, so just used a potato peeler. They weren't the most consistent size or shape, but that didn't seem to matter.

An easy, simple, delicious dish for the summer time. The lemon adds a nice bite and freshness to it. I might use a little less of the dressing next time, but overall I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
This recipe went over well. Even for people that don't particularly like zucchini all that much. I used walnuts because that was all that was available, but I am sure pine nuts will be better. I ate it as a main course but I can imagine this will go well with any white meat. Use the best Parmesean!

I made this twice. The first time, made it pretty much as written, though I went easy on the parmesan. It was easy and fun to make, and very tasty. The second time, I omitted the parmesan, and thought it was nothing special. I will definitely use the cheese, though I may try feta next time, as the cook from L.A. recommends.

Simple, healthy, and delightful. I used more lemon juice, more pine nuts, and less basil than the recipe asked for. It was delicious.

Have made this 4 times since I got the Aug magazine. It's my husband's new favorite summer salad. Love all the suggestions - I've made just as the recipe describes with the substitution of slivered almonds for pine nuts (what I had on hand.) For sure, don't use all the dressing, don't pour dressing on the zucchini until ready to serve, it does not hold well or make good leftovers (the lemon juice "cooks" the squash making it limp and soggy pretty quickly. I think some mint would be good with the basil. Can't wait to add cherry tomatoes and other veggies as others suggest.

I have made this salad for two different groups of guest and both times it got rave reviews. It is so easy and delicious. Make it exactly as the recipe reads and you will find it's a great way to use up that summer zucchini!

We found the parmesan did not blend well with the other flavors and the basil was just over powering. Of the 6 people at the table no one could finish their servings. It is a nice idea but I think the recipe needs tweaking. I will look for other recipes instead.

Great way to use up summer time squash. It was a nice change from other lettuces and spinach! Used grapeseed oil instead of olive.

Delicious. Used a little more freshly squeezed lemon juice for freshness and toasted the pine nuts for a few minutes in the oven. Added some diced eggplant that I heated with some of the vinaigrette for the zucchini and it was so very good. Huge thumbs up!!

Very good and flavorful. Made as directed, but like the idea of adding cooked shrimp. Very easy to prepare, and will make many times!

This turned out better than I thought. I used feta instead of parmesan - I highly recommend this, as the feta worked really well with the dressing and added great flavor. I also added a splash of truffle oil to mellow out the acidity of the lemon. Overall, the zucchini tasted fresh and had a nice crunch. I will make this again.

very refreshing & beautiful. delicious as is, although i forgot the basil one time i made it and it was still good. also can be used in sandwich or on bruschetta -- french bread with goat cheese & some of the zucchini. does not make for good leftovers though.

Made this tonight and I thought it was excellent. I made some minor adjustments. I cut back on the oil added a pinch of sugar and a small amount of dijon mustard to cut the tartness of the lemon and it was fabulous! I will definitely make it again. Everyone at my bbq loved it.

This was delicious and easy. It was a very flavorful use of a vegetable that does not have a lot of flavor on its own.

I tossed the dressing with a bag (1 lb?) of thawed frozen pre-cooked shrimp about an hour before serving. Then I tossed the dressed shrimp with the zucchini, basil, nuts, and cheese right before serving. It was delicious and a full meal. My toddler and even my very skeptical husband devoured it.

Rating: 3
Instead of preparing the "dressing," I just drizzled the zucchini strips with a small amount of olive oil, squeezed on half a lemon, sprinkled with S&P and tossed it all together. Next time I'll eliminate the cheese (can't believe I'm saying this). It just seemed unnecessary and added heaviness. Good. P.S. My partner liked the pine nuts xtra toasty.

I checked the other reviews and followed suggestions....it was delicious! I did not find it too oily or too lemony - but very refreshing. There is definitely a lot of dressing so check before you pour it all on. I also added some corn that I had - any additional veggies would be good also like peppers and/or grape tomatoes.

I should have read the reviews first, but there is way too much dressing in this dish. It was too oily and lemmony. It probably should have been chilled, too. We will not make this again.

We loved this salad. Easy an delicious. As others have commented, don't dress it until you are ready to eat it. The zucchini gives off a lot of liquid and it gets soggy. Also, I used raw pine nuts. Great.

I received a zucchini the size of a baseball bat from a friend and was in a quandry about how to prepare it. This recipe was perfect and I made it last night. I adjusted the amount of oil and salt since we are on low-sodium diets. I didn't have any pine nuts but used slivered almonds instead. We absolutely loved it and I will definitely make this again!

I liked the shaved Zucchini idea, and will use it again. But the dressing was way too salty/lemon-over-powered so I wouldn't use that again or at least significantly cut downt the amount of salt/lemon

GREAT summer salad - quick, pretty, light. As almost everyone else has commented - as written there is WAY too much dressing. A little goes a long way - save what you don't use for another salad. Don't dress the zucchini until ready to serve - the juice kinds of cooks the zucchini and makes it limp pretty quickly. Didn't have pine nuts on hand, subbed sliced almonds. Their crunch with the saltiness of the cheese and the mildess of the dressing and zucchini made a wonderful salad. Might add a little lemon zest to the dressing next time.

Excellent summer side dish/salad. It was easy and everyone enjoyed it. My only suggestion would be to dry off the ribbons of zucchini and keep them cold until tossing. Also, it doesn't require all of the dressing. We will be having this again!

What a creative way to use zucchini! I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made some substitutions (walnuts instead of pine nuts, etc.) but the overall base to the salad is a great idea. Once it sits in dressing for a minute, the zucchini wilts a little bit and becomes more leaf-like. I loved it.

Great fresh flavors, easy to make, and perfect for all that extra zucchini. Plus, very impressive in its appearance. I have made it twice in the last week, once for a BBQ and then as the first course for a dinner party, accompanied by zucchini fritters. The key is to not dress the salad to early--the zucchini ribbons maintain their structure a bit better if not left sitting in the dressing. Also, I used more of a 2:1 ratio of lemon juice to oil and found that plenty.

Absolutely delicious! The dressing is light and refreshing and SO EASY. My new favorite salad!

Made just as written. Next time I will pour on less of the dressing. Also found it to be quite spicy - maybe because I let it sit for an hour before serving. Still, a good way to use zucchini - the dressing is lemony, and the salad tastes quite fresh with the basil. We especially loved, however, the parmesan slices.

Not for me. All I could taste was olive oil and lemon and basil. And way too much olive oil at that, and I only used a quarter cup. I wanted to love this, but didn't. Apparently the lemon basil combo is just not my thing.

Wonderful! I had lots of yellow squash in my garden along with fresh basil. Used the yellow squash instead of zucchini. I think I could eat this salad every day of the summer. Half of the dressing would probably be enough for all of the squash. Now I am actually glad we have two squash plants instead of just one!

My B&A mag arrived the day the first zukes were ready in the garden, so I had it ultra-fresh with fresh-picked lettuce leaf basil. All I was missing were pine nuts, but I chopped up some almonds & threw them in. Very fresh-tasting & quick to make & I feel healthier suddenly !
