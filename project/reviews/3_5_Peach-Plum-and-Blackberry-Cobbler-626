This turned out really well. I used 4 peaches and 3 plums (what we had on hand from our CSA) so it was probably slightly tarter than usual -- but it was delicious.

This recipe was more work than it was worth. The topping in particular was not tasty and took extra time to prepare. The other cobbler recipe on this site was much more delicious and easier to prepare.

The results I got from this recipe (made last summer) were very good, especially with the addition of a small amount of tapioca to help thicken the filling. I already have friends asking me to make this recipe again as soon as the fruit is in season again!

I've made this cobbler many times, usually with strawberries and peaches. It is very easy and I spend about $6.00 on the components. Ice cream is must.

This recipe is so good, I look forward to peach season every year so I can make it again. I have made this for my whole family and it always gets rave reviews. So many people have asked for the recipe - I bring it with me whenever I bring this dish to a gethering.

The recipe was a little too "much" for me. I prefer a dish a little more simple.

My Family really liked this one. I substituded appricots for the peaches, since they weren't very good.Going to make this again with the peaches to see the difference.
