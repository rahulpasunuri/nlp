This was very simple, but we loved it -- healthy, comfort food. I used chard and could not bear to throw out the delicious stems, so I cut them up into small pieces and added them with the potatoes. I doubled the garlic and added a bit of minced ginger. I put all the greens on top and just put the lid on for a few minutes. Then mixed it through and Voila!

The reviewer who urged the use of a cast iron skillet was 100% correct! Just be sure to put the garlic on top of the potatoes, not directly on the hot surface of the skillet to avoid burning the garlic. And do use 2 cloves. This makes a generous amount for 2 people.

This dish is excellent. I doubled the garlic (I love garlic), and, as an earlier reviewer suggested, made sure that the greens were very dry before cooking them.

This was surprisingly tasty. I was a little concerned after reading some of the other reviews, but I had to find a use for the greens and potatoes from my CSA. I used a mix of cultivated organic dandelion and beet greens, and only had large red potatoes, which I quartered. I browned the potatoes on each side, which resulted in nice crispy potatoes. I had to be very careful, however, that the greens did not dry out as others had mentioned.

A nice way to simplify a meal. Dry the greens and make sure you use a cast iron pan to crisp and brown the potatoes!

This is great--fast and easy. The secret to the texture of the final dish is to dry the greens THOROUGHLY before you throw them into the skillet.

This is delicious and easy, and a nice way to get a green and a starch in one dish. It went well with the lemon rubbed chicken. I'm not sure why others had a problem with the dish being soggy--mine greens nearly burned!

This was OK. I don't think the greens and potatoes went together texturally tho. Crisp potatoes - damp greens...not a winning combination. But it didn't taste bad.

This is a very easy and flavorful side dish. I made this with chard and it turned out wonderfully. My guess is that some of the problems people have with this recipe come from not drying the green thoroughly enough before adding them to the potato mixture.

after creating delicously crispy fried potatoes, the addition of greens and cooking made the potatoes wet/soggy on the previously crispy surface. would do the greens and potatoes seperately.

The greens were sharp and bitter and the preparation did nothing to bring out the nutty, mellow flavor of the potatoes. You'd be far better off roasting the potatoes separately, and sauteeing the greens in olive oil with a hint of garlic and some lemon juice. Just as easy, and much tastier.

Trust me! This does not work with frozen spinach! BLECH!

This has become a standard in our house. It is always a hit and very good with the "Lemon Rubbed Chicken Legs"; also from Gourmet.

Served this last night with Spicy Grilled Salmon Steaks with Black Butter, and it was the perfect combination. I used Mustard Greens, which accompanied the salmon well. This is a very easy and tasty way to prepare greens (not to mention the potatoes). It's an all-in-one side dish.
