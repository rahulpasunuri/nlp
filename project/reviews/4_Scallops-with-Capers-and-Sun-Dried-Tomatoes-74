Good, not great. Husband liked it more than me. I don't understand how you can sautee the garlic and at med high heat keep the garlic from burning...what is the trick?! I did add a touch of cream and white wine to add more sauce...needs more sauce.

Loved this recipe. It will satisfy even the most 'jaded' foodies. Followed the recipe pretty closely, guesstimated measurements and it was fantastic. Served it over linguine which was perfect. Only thing I'd recommend is if your scallops are large (like mine were) you only need about 8. Scallops can be a little on the rich side. I'd toss 2 small- medium portions of pasta with the 'sauce' and then place the scallops on top (nicer presentation). Tonight I am trying a low carb option and placing the scallops on top of pureed Cauliflower and accompanying with a side of roasted asparagus.

I made this exactly as written, except halved the butter and olive oil. It probably would have been too oily with the full amount--with this modification it was fabulous. I'd made it previously without the thyme, and it was good, but the thyme made a big difference. I would assume it would work nicely with big shrimp or chicken, maybe with a bit of goat cheese on the latter?

This was fabulous, and fabulously easy. Forgot the thyme--it was still delicious. Will be a summer staple.

i thought this was really good, and really easy. the only change i made was using half the amount of butter and deglazing the pan with white wine. i will make again for sure.

Awesome! We are very picky and this was a quick, easy, tasty dish.The only thing I changed was the amount of butter-half as much-still came out great but probably wouldn't have produced enough sauce if serving over pasta..

Rating: 4
First of all, this is just as good with chicken, although I go ahead and use the zest and juice from an entire lemon (but I like things tangy). A half of a stick of butter is a lot calorie-wise, so I usually only use a tablespoon and it's fine. I highly recommend adding an entire bag of baby spinach to the sauce. It absorbs the flavor and makes a very tasty addition.

I reduced the olive oil to 1 T. and the butter to 2 T. and it was perfect. This is an excellent recipe - quick, easy and perfect for guests.

Didn't change a thing. This was great served with angel hair pasta. Next time I will try it with small scallops for a less expensive option.

We all liked this, especially after deglazing the pan with white wine, but next time I'll dial the thyme WAY back. I didn't even use as much as called for but it still totally overwhelmed the delicate scallop flavor. Subbing lemon basil...now that sounds like the trick to me!

Rating: 4
Recipe was quick and very flavorful. I cut way back on the butter which was an improvement. I did have to cook the scallops slightly longer because of their size but just let them simmer a little longer in the sauce briefly. My husband loved it and has already requested it again. Next time I might try adding a little white wine, for a little more sauce.

Fabulous. Followed recipe exactly except scallops needed a little more cooking time due to size. Took advise and measured everything. I did use slightly less butter and slightly more olive oil. It was so easy and tremendously flavorful.

Way too easy and very tasty. I fried the scallops without the garlic/lemon peel thinking they wouldn't hold up under high heat - a nice crispy scallop was my primary goal - after removing the scallops from the pan and turning down the heat, I added the garlic, lemon peel and remaining items to make the sauce according to recipe. Came out great. I made it for a very fussy crowd and they loved it as well.

Nice. Not spectacular, but tasty.

This was easy and really, really good. I served it with an arugula and baby romaine salad with a basil-balsamic vinaigrette. The scallops I bought were HUGE -- almost 2" wide and 1" thick -- so neither of us could actually finish the dish; it was too rich for that much "scallop". Will make again and again.

Rating: 3
Man, this was a breeze. And big on taste. Like a lot of the other reviewers, I pulled way back on the butter. Deglazed the pan with some white wine. and just used a pat of butter when rewarming the scallops in the pan. Will definitely serve this one to guests--and I'll actually have some time to socialize with them rather than sweating in the kitchen over their meal. Served it with cous-cous and sauteed spinach. Definitely a restaurant quality recipe.

This is our favorite scallop recipe, by far. So simple to prepare, and wickedly delicious, intense flavors. We do this for guests all the time now.

Easy to make and delicious. Lacking a lemon, we used reconstituted lemon juice and used a bit more than the recipe called for as we didn't have lemon rind. A bit too tart but still great. We served it over couscous with an inexpensive Chardonnay.

Rating: 3
Fairly easy, and very tasty. Make sure the pan is hot enough when you add the scallops so that they get a nice little crust. I went with slightly less butter as others advised, thanks for the idea.

Rating: 3
Interesting combination of flavors. Recommend adding a bit of white wine to the sauce and using a third of the butter (for a lighter dish). Tangy and tart sauce compliments the scallops perfectly. Serves well with couscous.

This is a very flavorful and colorful dish that looks and tastes like much more work than it really is. For any of you aspiring chefs without the time or training, this is a great way to impress.

This recipe was great. My husband couldn't believe that I "threw this together" on a Sunday night.I didn't use the butter to finish the sauce at the end. I don't think it changed the taste that much and it saved alot of calories.

This was very good. My husband and I love intense flavors especially capers and lemon. This is a great alternative to our favorite Coquilles St. Jacques....When we want a change in scallop preperation this is it. Serve with Jasmine rice and steamed snow peas with a sprinkle of fresh mint. Lovely!

This recipe was so easy and so tasty. My fiance couldn't get enough of it. Delicious!

This was really, really delicious! My husband said it is a definite keeper and asked me several times to keep it with the "good" recipes. I did cut back on the butter however and added a little extra lemon juice as we love lots of lemon. You probably could add a tb. of clam juice rather than lemon if you wanted to cut back on the butter but didn't want to add more lemon. I may try that next time. Totally great however.

This was truly fantastic. I served it with rice and grilled asparagus for a Valentine's Day dinner and it went over big. Easy to make, too.

I took the wine advice straight off the bat and I think it's a great idea but not with the lemon. TOgether they make it slightly acidic. Next time I will skip the lemon and just use wine. I deglazed the pan with the wine and thickened my sauce with flour. Pretty good result in the end. Added some cremini mushrooms also. I will be trying this one again though, I think it has a lot of potential.

This is so simple yet so flavorful! I can't wait to make it again. Quick to make for a week night dinner.

This was a great dish! I used 1/2 the amount of butter and used about 1/2 Cup of white wine and served it over linguine. It was so enjoyable I'm making it again tonight.

Lovely presentation, the aroma from the fresh lemon rind and juices (you gotta use fresh lemons, for sure!) was intoxicating. I used about half the butter called for, though. A neutral side dish, such as rice goes well. A keeper. Also, I used fresh local scallops the first timeand frozen-at-sea scallops the second time. Either way was good.

I totally agree with previous reviewers. This is easy, delicious, and very gourmet for a weeknight--or any other night! I, too, added a little bit of cream to the sauce. This is definitely a very flavorful way to prepare scallops.

My husband and I thought this was an excellant dish. We used fresh sun-dried tomatoes from the market that were not packed in oil. With the oil and butter added to the sauce you don't need more. Also, for the health concious you can probably use less butter (about 2/3 the amount) and it would still be rich enough. My husband sauteed the scallops for 3 minutes as the recipe called for but then grilled them on the grill on the opposite side just to brown them up. It was wonderful!!! Also we had a tossed salad with some grilled yellow pepper added to it. The dresing for the salad was a liitle olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was a very nice accompiament.

This was good as well as being easy. We love scallops but haven't found a lot of recipes for them that we would make a second time. This one is a keeper! Have found that the secret to making good scallops is not to overcook them and make sure they are VERY fresh.

My husband, who does not particularly care for scallops, says this recipe is a "keeper" and is definitely a company dish. I agree, since it was easy to make and full of flavor. I added a bit of whipping cream to the sauce and served it with bow tie pasta.

Excellent starter. Very easy to make.

I changed this recipe in two ways: First, my partner does not care for lemon on fish so I eliminated the lemon juice and rind. Second, we eat light so I used cooking spray on a non-stick pan, one teaspoon of olive oil and a 1/4 cup dry white wine to replace the butter and lemon juice. It was great.

Wow, was my wife impressed with my first attempt at a scallop dish! I sure picked a winner - thank you! We love capers so I will double the amount the next time I prepare this dish. I served it with Buttery Rice Pilaf and a vegetable medley.

Very good quick dinner, I changed the amount of butter to 1/4 stick instead of 1/2. Other than that it was very good.

Really enjoyed this recipe, specially since I love capers. I substituted lime for lemon and the dish turned out quite nice. Also followed the advice from the cook in Westlake Village, CA and used a little flour mixed with about 1/4 cup half and half, it kept it from being too tart and made the sauce creamy with a nice consistency. Angel hair pasta with some of the sauce over it was a nice side for this dish. This scallop recipe will definitely be a regular in my menu.

This dish is so delicious! I didn't change a thing, and followd the suggestion to serve it with a light side, I chose Linguini. I have made it twice in one month, and because it is so rich, I will wait a while to prepare again.

this is a very good receipe. I did add some of chopped sun dried tomatoes along with the minced- it is a winner.

Excellent. Serve with simple sides as this is quite intense. I served with pasta and steamed spinach. Pinot Grigio went well.

The sauce is very rich and tasty. In fact, I think it's too rich, and obliterates any character the scallops might have. Something like tree bark or fan belts might stand up better, and at a fraction of the cost.

Wonderful dish. I would like to re-emphasize the need to stick to the amounts stated as the flavours can be overpowering. I used sun dried tomato paste which worked perfectly well. A simple side dish is also mandatory such as rice or a mild couscous

This was quite delicious. Make sure you follow directions closely, as I added the scallops back to the skillet BEFORE I whisked in the butter, and by the time I added the butter afterwards, it was a bit clumpy. But very delicious. I had extra scallops left over, so I made the same recipe but I added pasta (angel hair) and blended milk and flour (cream, for those who aren't concerned about fat intake)and it was delicious - except that next time I'll cut back on the lemon juice a bit. I'll definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Very tasty, I've never had scallops this way before. Serve with a mild side as suggested by the others because it is very flavorful. Next time I would use more scallops (maybe my sea scallops were on the small side). Also, I wonder if there is a way to lighten it up a bit. The sundried tomatoes and capers were really the stars of the dish.

This was really good--packed with flavor. I didn't wash the scallops well enough, and there was a little bit of sand-Crunch! That's my fault, so I will do this one again. Served it with pilaf and roasted asparagus. Perfect and easy.

Wow! I don't think scallops have ever had it so good - what a wonderfully decandent dish! I thought the lemon was a bit overpowering. Next time, I'll reduce it to 1 tbsp. Definitely serve with something plain and simple. Enjoy.

This is a great recipe and it's easy to make - even for someone who does not cook very often. Be sure to follow the directions and don't make any substitutions. It's a favorite I've made for two to eight - it's easy to double. Try it with a side of pasta and a salad. Your guests will love it!

This dish has become one of my favorites since making it. It's a very rich dish with many heavy flavors, so a simple side like rice pilaf goes very well with it. Be careful to follow the recipe - too much of these ingredients overpowers the dish.
