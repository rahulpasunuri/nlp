I honestly don't think I'll be able to make straight mashed potatoes again-the celery root adds a minerally freshness that is fabulous. However I'd love for someone to recommend an efficient way to chop the celery root, I just about sprained my wrist....

Really delicious! Our grocery store was out of horseradish so we used horseradishe cream that we already had. We made half the recipe (for 2 people) and have enough for 2 more meals.

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did not use a mix of potato varieties, as suggested, only Yukon Golds. Come mashing time, I did not have the previous reviewer's problem of uneven texture - everything came together beautifully. They were quite creamy, I didn't need to use any reserved cooking liquid. We served them with a roasted beef tenderloin for Christmas dinner. The horseradish and sour cream really complemented the meat. We will definitely make these again!

Once again I learned that boiling together and then mashing different root vegetables is a mistake; the various textures don't mash alike, and the result is lumpiness. If I ever want to do that again, the different vegetables must be boiled, and mashed, separately, then blended together. But this receipe wouldn't be worth that; the potato / celery root mixture did not taste so wonderful.

These were amazing. Don't let the amount of horseradish scare you off, boiling it along with the potatoes and celery root really mellows the flavor. You could taste the undercurrent of the celery root, horseradish and mustard in ever bite but they never overpowered the potatoes. I made them exactly as directed and they were a big hit at a dinner party where the main course was a Prime Rib Roast.
