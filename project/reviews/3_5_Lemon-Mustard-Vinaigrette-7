Made to go with Salad Nicoise. When I juiced a large lemon, I ended up with 5 Tbsp. juice, so decided to throw it all in. While that might be too tart for a green salad, I thought it played off the fish, roasted fingerling potatoes, and egg really well. Unlike most other reviewers, didn't have access to fresh tarragon, and still made out OK. Recommend.

Blech. Way to much lemon ... what a waste of fresh tarragon.

Absolutely use fresh tarragon! I will use half as much mustard next time, as its flavor obscured everything else in the salad.

Best with 1 1/2 t. of FRESH tarragon.

This would have been an excellent vinaigrette, but the (fresh) tarragon adds an entire new diminsion. It took would would have been a nice but bland salad (red leaf lettuce, endive, orange and yellow bellpeppers) and made it exceptional. I plan to make this again soon.

Especially nice with Meyer lemons.

I used fresh frozen tarragon from my garden. It worked wonderfully for the Salmon Salade Nicoise that calls for it.

Good basic vinaigrette....but don't waste your time with dried tarragon; gotta use fresh....
