Oh my. This is the perfect collision of potato chips and mashed potatoes. We're talking crisp and rich and salty and herby and ... wow. If there's a better side for skirt steak, I've never had it.

Superb recipe and so easy! It really must be done in an iron skillet. The potatoes are delicious and so crispy. They easily come out of the pan.

Maybe I sliced the potatoes too thin, but this just did not work for me. They separated and became more like chips, than a galette... Maybe if they are sliced thicker next time they may hold together better, or if I add more layers, maybe... Also, was pretty bland. Definitely like the ideas of boosting the flavor with roasted garlic and parmesan. I used fresh rosemary, could have used more. Altogether, could be great with some experimentation.

The way I modified the recipe turned out great! I peeled and grated the potato. It's important to get out the extra moisture, so grate into a bowl double lined with paper towel or a kitchen towel. I used coarse salt, fresh ground black pepper, chopped fresh rosemary, parsley, green onions, and garlic, layered between handfuls of grated potato. I think it's key to use a cast iron skillet. You can easily go from the stove to the oven and the galette gets perfectly crispy. It was delicious!

Not so special. Nothing memorable about this other than how pretty it looks while in the pan..by the time it is cut and served, less remarkable, as was the flavour.

Definitely a family favorite and a great alternative to frozen potatoes for weekday dinners. With a little ketchup, even the 6-year old will eat it. ;)

The taste of the potatoes was excellent, however, I grated the potatoes and then soaked them in ice water. I don't think that I sufficently drained the potatoes as this did not crisp up as described. Nonetheless - these are a winner.

My standard for a great galette is the one served at La Madeleine, a French bakery based in Dallas but which has a few locations here in New Orleans. This was very close and very good. I shredded the potatoes like they do at La Madeleine and also added some green onion and a little bit of thyme and pepper. I flipped the galette over after about 18 minutes so that the other side could brown also. Magnifique!

Used Yukon gold potatoes and my old iron skillet...Yum!

This is my favorite potato recipe. I thinly slice red onion and make a layer of red onion between the two potato layers. I top the galette with minced red onion, more rosemary, and a little freshly grated parmesan. Also I often add fresh sage, which goes very well with the potatoes. You can get away with using only < 1 Tablespoon olive oil. I agree with the Parsippany reviewer -- this looks (and smells!) stunning coming out of the oven.

This dish is excellent! The rosemary is a perfect compliment, and the bottom gets so nice and crispy brown! YUM! We will definitely make this one again! (It really looks dramatic coming out of the oven in the cast iron pan, too!)

I have tried a similar recipe, but this one is by far better. This will become one of our favorite potato recipes, it is easy to prepare and the end result is great.

The potatoes did not get very brown on the bottom. I think the next time I make them I will leave them on the stove for a little longer to get them brown. I did bake them at a little lower temp as I had something else in the oven that was a little more temp sensitive. However, they were good and I will make them again.

I've made this recipe a few times, and while it tastes good, - it doesn't always look good - it sticks to the pan.

I've made this recipe four or five times and each time it has received rave reviews. I always double the recipe and use more butter than olive oil. I use a ton of fresh rosemary and sometimes add roasted garlic. My oven is funny, but I always cook it longer than called for. It helps if the potatoes are spread out a bit in the pan (if the pan is too small the spuds get gooey).

My wife, who is a picky eater just loved this recipe, I have made it several times, for guesta also, all loved it.

This has now become one of our favorite potato recipes. I like to heat the butter/oil with the rosemary and some crushed garlic and leave it for about an hour to infuse the flavours. You have to reheat it of course before making the dish. We have grated parmesian cheese on top before putting it in the oven also.

this recipe is easy to prepare, flexible in that it can be increased slightly to feed 3-4, and tasty. i occasionally add caramelized onions or parmesian cheese between the potato layers and i use powdered rosemary, rather than crumbled, to difuse the strong flavour of the crumbled herb. we serve it with meats, primarily, though it has appeared with grilled swordfish in the past.
