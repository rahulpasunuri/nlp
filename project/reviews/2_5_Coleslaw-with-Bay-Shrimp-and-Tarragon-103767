Yummy! I added just a touch of vinger flavored tarragon and some sourcream. This was a very easy and fast recipe. Got raves in our house. Also I had no problem with the cabbage staying crisp. Dish was served in less than 4 hours after making.

This was not worth the effort. It became limp adn everything was sort of the same color. No taste - we disliked it so much, we threw it all out after the first taste!! No amount of seasoning helped because the slaw did not stay crisp and crunchy. Don't waste your time.

The only thing I would change: 1. Using regular type cole-slaw. 2. Add 2 Tabs. honey * If you use sliced cole-slaw steam it just a little till SLIGHTLY limp.
