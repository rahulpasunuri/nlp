I was SO disappointed! I read the reviews and I looked at other recipes before deciding on this. I'm sure it was my fault, but, the pie filling was like liquid! I poured it into the frolla dough.,What I shouldn't have done at that point was to put a crust on top. The lattice sunk into the pie. I went ahead and baked it not knowing what to expect. The flavor was absolutely delicious, however the texture left a lot to be desired. I have my own chickens, and I was thinking that maybe the eggs were too big and liquefied it more than necessary. I'm not sure. It was a LOT of work and little to none reward. Oh, and I added citron to it as many recipes suggested, but the texture was horrible. I'll try again but maybe not this recipe.

This is my second time making this recipe and with some tweeking I am going to give it four forks. Made as directed it was way too dry. So, here is what I did to make it four forks worthy. First, the twelve inch pie is way too big. Instead I did 1 1/2 times the recipe and used two eight inch pans. I gave one away since even an eight inch pie is enough to serve many people. Second, I used fresh ricotta, but only let in drain for about six hours; four would have been plenty. Draining it more the last time resulted in a dry, crumbly mess. Not this time. It had just the right amount of moisture. Third, I soaked the wheat at least eight hours. It could have even gone longer. Then I cooked it about an hour or so, until the milk was pretty much gone. Finally, it is important to use very fresh candied citrus. I actually used candied fruit from an Italian market. YUM! Now this was wonderful. Delicious, subtle flavors bouncing around; a lovely dense but not too rich texture and a beautiful presentation.

I made this last year and it was wonderful...but even better a few days later. This year I'm making it a few days early. I do have a question, though...I decided to buy the canned cooked wheat this year. Does anyone know what amount I would use for this recipe? Thanks!

I am not rating this recipe since I baked this pie using another recipe - Michele Scicolones, published two years ago in the Easter issue of Gourmet. It turned out very delicious and it uses the most common 9-inch springform pan. If someone is interested I posted the recipe and photo at www.bakingobsession.com

My pie turned out very dry. I used high quality fresh ricotta and I think that this resulted in too little fluid to keep the pie moist. It was so dry it crumbled. I would definitely skip the draining process next time. I also found the dough very very hard to work with--and I am a very experienced baker. It got too hard in the frig and then too soft on the counter. Next time I will plan to work with it after an hour rather than save it for a day. It would be better to get it into the pan and sliced into lattice in advance if you want to wait to bake. Also, this pie is HUGE and I pulled some out to make a small pie as well. Next time I will probably make three small pies, cutting the baking time, and will give two away.

I found it pretty much impossible to use a food processor, but a hand mixer worked fine. I used barley, and it only needed to simmer for about 20 minutes. I initially had trouble with the dough - let it warm up and get flexible, and use plenty of flour on your rolling surface. A great, if very rich, dessert!

I had a terrible time with this recipe! I am a fairly experienced dessert & pie baker but still had some issues. First, the pasta dough was very hard to work with. It crumbled apart when I first tried to roll it out so I kneaded it a bit at room temp to get it back to a state where it could be rolled out. Then it was too sticky. I ended up patching it into the pan. In addition, although I used fresh ricotta and let it drain overnight, not much liquid came out so the filling was too wet. Finally, I had trouble finding the wheat kernels and by mistake bought "organic whole wheat" grains that I thought would work. They never softened up enough despite hours more of soaking and cooking time. I later read in a book that I should have used barley if I couldn't find the wheat berries, I probably bought "unhulled" ones. The pastry did inded taste delicious but the fililng was inedible and I threw out about $30 worth of ingredients! So, beware when making this recipe that you have time and patience and purchase the right grain.

I always bought my grain pies from a pastry shop in Brooklyn. Everyone loved this one when I made it for Easter. I think I'll save my $25 from the pastry shop and use it towards the ingredients for my own.

Unable to find wheat kernels so I substituted rice and cooked for 10-15 minutes so a bit of bite remained. Same with orange water-substituted 1/4 teaspoon orange oil. Candied orange peel-substituted fresh zest of one large orange & minced. Despite the necessary substitutions, this recipe tasted wonderful & will be on this Easters table again. Don't forget to sprinkle the top with pastel colored sugars before baking!

I live in a small area and can't find orange water. I do have pure orange oil. Can I turn that into orange water?

I loved this recipe! It was fairly simple to make. The pastry does break apart but it doesn't matter - just patch it and go on. The texture of the pastry is lovely and very tasty. For the filling I found wheat berries in the can and that saved some time. I followed the directions on the can to prepare the berries and then incorporated them into this recipe. The results were very good. My family and friends loved it. I look forward to making it again.

this recipe is right on the money, this is the real thing, however you must use fresh ricotta which has been drained. If you use the commercial ricotta it will result in a thin batter, you can compensate with more wheat but better to find real ricotta. Lydia BRAVA

Natalie, did you remember to drain both the wheat and the ricotta? This extra liquid could cause the filling to be runny. Good luck!

Did anyone have a problem with the filling soupy? recipe said scrape and mine poured. had to refrigerate so top dough would not sink. I made this last year another recipe and this did not happen. I reviewed my steps and nothing was done wrong. Please anyone reply.

This is a pretty hard recipe to find... I used to buy it in Ferrara's NYC, but now I Make it from scratch... I can also recomment some orange zest.. but, you need the orange flower water.. or else forget about making it.. and do not use an over excess of grain- it becomes to filling.. but, otherwise.. love this recipie!!! look in italian deli's for the canned grain.. some still have it!
