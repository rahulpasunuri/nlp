This is my favorite summer salad, very refreshing. I love squid as a protein and it is so easy to prepare. Tamarind is very Umami. I always serve it with a steaming bowl of jasmine rice and miso marinated slivers of beef to play on opposite textures. If fish sauce is too much, you can always substitute with soy sauce for a milder result.

This recipe is not for the feint of heart. I couldn't find tamarind paste so I made some out of a package of tamarinds. I separated the seeds from the pods and boiled them with water for about 10 min. They became pasty really fast. Then squeeze through cheese cloth. It made just about the right amount for this recipe - not a lot for a whole package of seeds. The fish sauce dominates the overall flavor of this dish, but I'm not sure what a good substitute would be. Without it, it would be rather one dimensional. I'm unsure what to serve with this. We are staring at it in wonder and can't figure out how to make it into a meal.

Excellent if you like the texture of squid and the taste of fish sauce. I only had small squid so I used rings rather than the flower-cut large squid. I prefer it with a crumbled dried Thai chile rather than the sriracha sauce which covers the taste of the fish sauce and lime.
