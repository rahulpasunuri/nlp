Very good and easy! Made with leftover veggies in the fridge and leftover ham from Easter. Didn't have barley, used rice!

We use this as our kitchen-sink soup of choice whenever we have a ham bone on hand. The barley is essential (although rice or beans works nearly as well), but after that, use whatever veggies you have on hand. We often use celery, carrots, corn, and peas and then we throw in spinach or kale if we have it in the fridge. It's a great way to use up the odds and ends of veggies that are sitting in your fridge. Absolutely delicious.

This is a delicious winter soup as written. A little garlic and hot sauce were minor additions. Will definitely make this again.

I love a good soup recipe and this is a great one. Hearty and packed with veggies and the barley tops it off. I used frozen peas instead of green beans because that's what I had on hand. My 16 year old son even liked it! Like many, I used left over ham with bone.

Love this soup! Added sweet potato and I think this made it even better. My husband says it is the best soup he has ever had - and he is not a fan of ham! Wonderful as written, and a great base to be played with.

What a great new addition to our winter stew rotation! I really love the barley- a nice break from pasta or beans! Having read other reviews, I tinkered just a bit and added a large bunch of kale and a few dashes of Franks Red Hot sauce. Perfect healthy cold weather meal.

I have made this recipe numerous times. I use ham with bone and it is awesome. Did add a little garlic and thyme. Great cold weather soup. Barley really makes the difference, nice change from beans.

This was great! I've made twice, coincidentally exactly eight years apart. I guess now we know when it turns soup weather in NYC. I turned it into a real kitchen sink soup, using many of the suggestions from other reviewers and stuff I had on hand: -garlic (always) -kale -a little green pepper -fresh corn uncooked, just cut off the cob -the ham hocks gave good flavor, but no meat, so 1/2 pound of thick diced ham -used fresh tomatoes instead of canned -thyme as well as oregano -worstershire sauce -liquid smoke -tabasco - just a dash, so little yo can't really taste but somehow added something My husband was shocked that there were no beans, so I added 1 cup or so of small white beans. Of course, with all the extra ingredients, it needed extra broth/water. Too early for rutabaga at the NYC farmers' market, but I bet it would be great.

I made do with things on hand. I used a leftover ham bone and vegetable broth rather than chicken broth. I didn't have green beans so I added two cups of fresh spinach right before serving. I added the potatoes the last twenty minutes of cooking time. My husband and grandson loved the soup. I will definitely make it again.

Made this and everyone raved. On advice from others, I added sweet potato and threw in frozen lima beans for a substitute to the green beans.

This is an excellent soup though I did make a few, mostly essential, alterations. Since I can't have barley, I used short-grain brown rice plus a small handful of wild rice, and that worked nicely. I thought about using kasha (also gluten free) but wondered if it would change the taste too much. Frozen black-eyed peas (from the garden) worked well in lieu of the green beans. Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I added fresh garlic and raggedly chopped green kale minus the hefty stems. The kale definitely gave this soup some character w/o overwhelming the flavor. Unlike cabbage, it retained its color and texture w/o getting mushy. Great soup!

I'd make this again. Thefamily liked it very much and it filled the house w/ the wonderful aroma of smoked ham. Next time I'll experiment with the herbs. I used fresh sage instead of oregano.

I used a leftover Easter ham-bone (with lots of meat on it) and used WATER instead of broth. It was plenty salty but very, very good. I would make it again.

I was looking for something to do with leftover Easter ham and made this as one of the options that week. I didn't even manage to finish the first bowl and ended up throwing most of the batch away. It was just a bunch of stuff in a pot with an unpleasant lingering smell. Too bad! I like all of the ingredients, just not together.

This is a very hearty soup for a cold winter day. I added some sweet potatoes and chopped kale with some garlic. Add a slice of bread on the side and this is wonderful.

I added diced sweet potato and chopped Kale with a little garlic as suggested by another reader - It was a very hearty soup for a cold winter day. Have some bread on the side - YUMMM! Enjoyed very much.

Rich and yummy. Added a spoonful of minced ginger, and the garlic as many recommended. Used ham shanks for more meat, frozen yellow tomatoes and a seeded squash from the end of summer harvest, and some turkey broth frozen from Thanksgiving. So many ways to make this and I bet they are all wonderful.

Made as written. I thought it was pretty good, but my spouse didn't like it at all.

Great soup! I followed the recipe verbatim, aside from Yukon gold potatoes in lieu of russet... I see this recipe as a perfect way to dump a variety of odd vegetables you're looking to unload from an overstuffed crisper drawer. Very tasty results, and my boys 7 & 5 enjoyed it too.

Took this to my son's medieval history banquet and got rave reviews! This was SO simple, but SO good! I didn't have the ham hocks, so I used leftover smoked ham, and added 1/2 teaspoon or so of liquid smoke. I also added 1 teaspoon of worcestershire, and I forgot the green beans! Excellent stuff!

Just like Mom used to make. Maybe better. Had a rutabaga to used up--excellent soup! A winner!

I was seeking a recipe to use the bone from a Honey Baked ham we ate on Easter. This recipe fit the bill and I had all of the ingredients on hand. The soup is rockin' (to quote my husband)! I didn't have fresh green beans and I added an extra cup of broth because we like our soup a little soupier. Otherwise, I prepared the recipe as written. Great flavor!

I took some liberties due to what was one hand: I had smoked turkey wings on hand and a 1/2 lb. piece of kielbasa and subbed that for the smoked ham hocks, adding the kielbasa near the end of simmering. Added a 1/4 tsp. liquid smoke and 3 cloves of garlic, used 5 carrots, didn't have green beans and used a mixture of turkey/chicken/beef broth to make up the 10 cups. Made it in the moring, simmering uncovered to reduce the liquid a bit, and we enjoyed this delicious soup for dinner with the snow falling outside. Outstanding! Hubby commented several times that this recipe has to be saved! Thanks, Michelle!

Wonderful soup. We used our leftover ham from easter, added extra potatoes and carrots. We didn't have low-sodium chicken broth in the pantry, but regular worked fine. My family had this soup for dinner and was a favorite as a leftover. We will definately use this receipe again.

I too used beef broth and a leftover ham bone from Christmas (also added a can of black eyed peas for good luck on Jan 1st). Very good.

This soup is spectacular. Use low-salt chicken broth (I like Swanson). I doubled the barley, added peas, corn, and white beans. It was awesome.

This is my favorite soup to make. If you live near a honey baked ham store you can buy their ham bones with meat on it for around $10.00. This eliminates the salty taste.

I actually prefer it without the potatoes. The barley is enough. Great taste. Everyone loved it!

This recipe was way too salty, and I'm usually not sensitive to salt. Try the recipe for Porcini Mushroom and Barley Soup with Pancetta on this site - it's much better.

wonderful! if a soup or sauce is too salty. add a thick slice or two of raw potato, it will soak up some of the salt.

This is a great and easy soup! I especially like the green beans added at the end--they have a different texture and keep it from seeming like a mushy soup. Very hearty, good flavors. One caveat: Leftovers are too salty.

amazing soup. I too used mostly beef broth instead of the chicken broth. added some extra veggies like corn,peas,frozen beans,increase amount of celery and carrots. i also added lots of garlic-never cook without garlic. terrific soup,hearty and tasty for all

This soup was incredible. However, I did make two major changes. I used beef broth instead of chicken and I used 1 pound of dried Great Northern beans (which had been soaked according to package directions)instead of fresh green beans. I make bean soups often and I my husband said this was the best I had ever made!

So good on a chilly day with some nice French bread to soak up the wonderful broth. Made it as recipe suggested with only one alteration. Had a ham bone left from another dinner party; used it instead of the ham hocks.

I decided to ry this as a possible yummy way to use a ham bone. Boy was I unprepared for the result. The richness and depth of the soup was amazing. It was absolutely delicius. I used more broth, more barley, frozen green beans, and added frozen corn and peas. Really, really good.

Wonderful soup! Very tasty. I made it with a leftover ham shank, used 4 cans chicken broth, 1 can beef broth and 1/2 can water. I also added garlic. Instead of oregano, I used an all-purpose seasoning (that includes oregano) plus I added garlic salt. I used 1/2 a potato and some cabbage plus the celery. I did not add any other salt.

I changed it up and it is awesome. I took your suggestions and made it the night before so it could rest. I put in lentils instead of barley and put in 3 cups of beef broth instead of all chicken and also put in leeks instead of onion. I used 2 smoked hamhocks and had the store crack them first. It is not too salty at all and the flavor is really rich and delicious. I would make this again - but add the lentils a little further into the cooking.

This soup tasted fantastic and was very quick and easy to put together. My husband loved it and took some for lunch today. If you chill it and remove the fat from the broth as well as trim the fat from the ham hock when dicing it is fairly healthy as well.

This tastes even better the second day. Next time I will make this with 1 smoked ham shank (more meaty than ham hocks) and some leftover baked ham. It first tasted extremely salty but was much better day 2 after the flavors blended. I will definately make this again. I did make this again with 2 smoked ham shanks and frozen beans and served it with cornbread. YUMMY! It does taste better the 2nd day...so I made it at night! Brought some to the neighbors and they loved it too... and our company all asked for seconds.

This broth was WAY too salty. It really detracted from the other yummy ingredients in this soup. Not worth the effort.

My family rates this at the top as a hearty soup. I didn't have celery on hand and so I added a half a small cabbage, chopped coursely. Next time I will leave out the potatoes since the barley does the trick as a starch. Wonderful flavor!

It was pretty good. Good way to use up a left-over bone from ham. I, as some others also increased the barley to 3/4 cup. I think it tasted better the next day when re-heated. All and all, a good winter soup.

I've made this soup a few times now and it's great. I've varied some of the ingredients to suit our tastebuds as follows: - our local shop doesn't stock hocks so I used an unsmoked gammon joint and reserved half the cooked meat for carving ham (very tastily flavoured!) - vegetable stock instead of chicken (too salty as we had trouble finding lo-salt chicken stock) - swapped out half the potatoes and added parsnip - used twice the amount of barley which made a more filling all in one meal. We liked it some much we even make it and freeze it for the nights we don't want to cook.

We loved this soup. I used a ham bone rather than ham hocks, and boiled it for 2 hours before adding the rest of the ingredients. When I make it again I'll add 3/4 a cup of barley rather than 1/2. I also used frozen green beans which worked fine. The fragrance of the oregano permeated the house. It was wonderful!

Really liked this soup. Great for Christmas ham leftovers. My husband insisted on taking some to work (not a brown bagger usually) he loved it. I used both potatoes and rutabega and used 1 cup barley. One cup of barley is a little much 3/4 would have been better.

This recipe does indeed make enough for a dozen but my family of 3 loved it so much we barely got two meals out of it! I didn't have smoked ham hocks but I did have the remnants of a baked ham. I boiled it for hours w/onions, celery, etc., cooled, skimmed fat and got lots of chunky ham for the soup. I used the ham broth instead of chicken broth and added a little white wine. After I'd spent all that time preparing, I realized I was out of potatoes. But I was NOT out of rutabegas, so I cut up half a big rutabega and tossed that in (figured since both are root veggies it's okay to substitute!). The peppery rutabegas were PERFECT for this hardy soup and really made it special. I put in 1/2 c barley on the first go 'round and added another 1/2 c on the reheat. Next time I make it I think I'll reduce the amount of carrots (the carrot taste overshadowed the others a little bit) and increase the rutabegas!

One of the best soup recipes I've found. The oregano adds a distinct flavor I hadn't expected. I believe the symbol in front of Barley stands for scant. This could easily be increased to 1½ cups of barley, as currently there are only about two pieces in each spoon full. I advise adding the barley with the ham and increasing the simmer time to 45 min. Then, after adding the rest of the ingredients, reduce remaining simmer time by 15 minutes to 45 minutes. There is enough soup to easily feed 12 so half the recipe or plan on freezing some.

Very Good and good for you. I couldn't read the exact amount of barley to add, so I added 2/3 cup of barley.
