I wish I'd read the other reviews before I began making this cheesecake, because I too discovered that the malt flavor is much too subtle. Next time I'll triple the malt and leave out the chocolate or swirl it through the batter. Straining the malt mixture didn't seem necessary--I'll skip that step next time. I used milk chocolate chips to save myself the task of chopping the chocolate. Other cooks said the recipe makes too much filling, and I agree (saved the extra). I used a 9" springform pan. Even though I didn't fill it all the way, the cheesecake took almost 4 hours to bake at this low temp. On the plus side, it had a moist, mousselike texture. For the crust, I used one package (7.5 oz) of Chessman shortbread cookies and made up the deficit with Chips Ahoy. It was a gloppy mess when I pressed it into the pan, but it ended up being the best cheesecake crust I've ever made. It held together beautifully and tasted great. Forgot to butter the mold, and the cake stuck to the sides. I disguised that flaw with chopped malted milk balls--a perfect fix.

I RECENTLY ATE THIS CHEESECAKE AND IT WAS THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD BUT WHEN I ASKED THE COOK SHE TOLD ME SHE DOUBLED THE MALT AND USED DARK CHOCOLATE. TRY THIS BECAUSE IS IF FABULOUS

So good! I made this recipe, exactly as stated, for a friend's birthday party. It was a hit. It was the first time I've ever made a cheesecake, which blew everyone away, as well. I used a tall, 9 inch pan and filled it to the top, making it especially deep. The cake isn't overly chocolatey or malty. I'll definitely make it again.

I'd like to try and make these as "bites" for a dessert party. Any suggestions for the cooking time and yield?

I was disappointed with this recipe. I felt that the malt flavor was not strong enough; it really just tasted like a standard chocolate cheesecake. I also used shortbread cookies as the recipe suggests for the crust and when mixed with the other ingredients they were way too wet and buttery. Perhaps it was the brand of cookies I used, but I do think that a simple graham cracker crust would have been way better.

YUM! Really nice cheesecake. I somehow under-measured the chocolate so injected ganache into the cold cheesecake until it bulged with chocolate, and let it set again. The best mistake I ever made! Delicious veins of semi-hard chocolate throughout. I used a 9 1/2" pan and had a huge overflow and enough filling to make another ramekin worth. Next time I'd reduce the filling by 1/4.

Excellent cheesecake - really like the taste - the malt makes all the differences - it took about 40 minutes longer to bake

Exceptional! I had no idea there were so many malted milk ball freaks out there beside my husband. The neighbors are at the gate, demanding more. Made the cheesecake as directed but used a graham cracker crust since the ingredients were on hand. I will try the shortbread crust next time. Used a 9" pan w/ no problem. Bake time was too long for my oven. This made 16 servings (as light as the taste is, it is deceiving rich).

My wife made this for me for New Years Eve Dinner. It was fantastic! Also added extra malt balls chopped coarsely in food processor. Made 1/4 recipe and used 2 4" springform pans. This way we had one New Years Eve and one New Years day. Served with Expresso.

I am about to make this again right now, so I thought I would do a quick review. I made this for a jewelry party for a friend. It was VERY well received. The malt flavor is subtle but a great addition. I used a chocolate crust and topped it with dark chocolate ganache. It will serve a ton. Also, I made it in my 9" and there was too much batter, so I make a tiny 4" cheesecake also (its my friend's birthday). Cheesecakes take time, but with practice it gets easier. Just make sure all the ingredients are room temp, it mixes much better. This is a 4 star recipe for sure!

Such a great cheesecake! The malt flavor is wonderful without being overpowering. Everyone loved it. Made it in a 10- inch springform pan and it worked well. Though we loved it as is, next time I will try mixing in a few ounces of chopped malted milk balls for a little extra pizazz. Also great after 3 weeks of being frozen.

This was a huge hit with the office for a send-off for an employee who loves chocolate and Malt. One of the best I've made.

This has been rated by co-workers as the second-best cheesecake that I make! I made it exactly as written and I thought the malt flavor was a little subtle, but still delicious. The batter tasted fabulous before adding the chocolate, so next time I will decrease the amount of chocolate slightly to let the malt come through a little better. Also, you could probably decrease the filling recipe by 1/4 as I used a 9.5 inch springform and it was very, very close to overflowing.

My search for the ultimate chocolate cheesecake has ended. Bake in the water bath for a perfect crack free top!

I have made several cheesecakes before and this one is the best. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a little time consuming, but it was well worth the effort. Rave reviews from the dinner party.
