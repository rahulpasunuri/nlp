Was excellent and low fat. I didn't have shallots so used a sweet yellow onion and it was great. I used frozen corn for the blender part and fresh corn for the non-blender part to save time and non of my guests could tell that I played this little trick. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I made this largely according to the recipe, but I substituted onions for shallots. I also sauteed in vegan margarine substitute. Instead of whipping cream, I mixed in a dollop of tofutti sour cream, and it was absolutely delicious! I'll definitely be making this soup again -- it was hearty, colorful, and very yummy.

Very good recipe. I used onions as well instead of shallots. I also topped it with a little cheddar cheese. I will definitely make it again.

Lovely simple soup, the flavors go very nice together. I added soy milk instead of whipped cream, because I am a calorie-counting roomie of lactose intolerant folks. I can see how it could have used a little extra silkiness, but it wasn't much missed.

Absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as directed with fresh corn and topped with chopped bacon. It was a wonderful late summer meal on the first chilly night of the season, served with crusty bread and a salad.

Very easy and yummy. I made a few additions because I had this stuff on hand and wanted to make some use of it - some chopped asparagus, several sliced mushrooms, about 1/2 cup of light sour cream instead of the cream, and 1/2 of a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce pureed with the broth and corn. It turned out great! The chipotle added a great little kick.

as an Central European, I have never had the chance to taste this dish, but when i saw this recipe, I though I will give it a go and fell in love with the taste immediately. It is a very easy and absolutely delicious dish.

I tried this for the first time tonight and the chowder is good. My only problem was that I have a small food processor and not a blender so my puree was not as smooth as it probably should have been. The chowder was a bit runny so I added a cornstarch/water mix, a little more cream and that did the trick. I will make this again but I feel like this is more of a side dish item instead of a main course but tasty nonetheless.

Absolutely delicious! Exceptional, for such an easy recipe, with ingredients easily on hand (I had to substitute onions for shallots & got great results)

I used veggie broth, vegan margarine, an onion instead of the shallots, and omitted the whipping cream. Overall -- tho' -- still good. Way easy.

I made this several months ago exactly as instructed and very much enjoyed it. Tasted even better the second day. I like that it doesn't require a lot of cream and uses shallots rather than onions. Is therefore very good for eating anytime of year, including warm spring nights here in New Orleans. However, I think that I will combine this recipe with that of the Spicy Corn Chowder tonight as I wish to add shrimp and so want to make a slightly heartier dinner for a cold fall night.

I added it crab and it was great! Can't wait to make it again with fresh corn.

I disagree with the first reviewer who said it lacked flavor. It is basic, versatile and delicious. I also make it with leftover corn on the cob.

Easy yes, but lacking flavor.

Easy, delicious, hearty. I use vegetable stock and then served both crumbled bacon and bacon bits made from soy, hot sauce, chopped chicken, chopped ham, shredded cheddar, and chopped scallions on side. Works as a main course for both vegetarians and meat eaters.

Made this recipe exactly as directed and it was very good. Added cooked and crumbled bacon to the leftover chowder the next day and it was exceptional. Add a couple of dashes of Tabasco and you'll be in chowder heaven!
