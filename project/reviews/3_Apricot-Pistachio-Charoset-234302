The only food items prohibited during Pesach (Passover) are those things made with or from the five grains - wheat, barley, rye, spelt and oats. Some Ashkenazi also include beans, rice and corn in the mix. Saffron only is and always has been an herb (spice if you like) there are no prohibitions on spices. Honey is prohibited because of the possibility of the bees getting from one of the five grains. Rivka7NV

I made this for a seder-inspired dinner for my gourmet supper club. Rather than chop up the apricots with the pistachios & other ingredients, I mixed everything except the apricots, then opened them like little pita pockets and stuffed the wine-pistachio mix inside. It made a great looking and tasting amuse bouche!

The comment that saffron is not kosher for Pesach/Passover is *inaccurate*. SOME communities choose to not eat certain things, including honey and saffron. That does not mean that everyone follows that custom.

I was so excited to read this recipe but saw that it included saffron (not kosher for passover, epicurious :( ) I will not be making this and want to be sure others know saffron is not kosher for passover.

This was delicious and was a nice change from the more traditional charoset. Could definitely taste the moscato and saffron, which was good. Added some honey (approx. 2 tablespoons) to make a moister, more cohesive mix.

I couldn't taste either the wine or the saffron, a disappointment. Will amp them up the next time and probably delete the lemon juice. I'm even tempted to sneak in some carmelized onions. Good texture.
