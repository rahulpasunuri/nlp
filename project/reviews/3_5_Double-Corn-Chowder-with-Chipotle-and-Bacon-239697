Very interesting chowder - lots of texture. Very filling, too. Recipe is very good as it is; however, instead of just one pepper, I chose to add two chipotle peppers and a spoonful of the adobo sauce. Next time, will add three peppers since we enjoyed the spicy, smoky taste so much.

This is 4-star with my modifications-- used 1/2 cup dried corn,chicken broth instead of water,1- 2 tsp Mexican oregano, 2 onions,6 cloves garlic,diced hot red pepper,and diced red potato. I used half&half, but Latin "crema" would be even better, and is more heat tolerant. Ground chipotle powder makes it smokier and spicier.

I was excited to try this recipe, and my husband loved it. The consistency of the maiz trillado was unexpected and a very nice counterpoint to the crisp texture of the fresh corn. I added four chipotles rather than just one and I think that it was an important addition, as the chipotle flavor makes the chowder. Overall, a very enjoyable corn chowder.
