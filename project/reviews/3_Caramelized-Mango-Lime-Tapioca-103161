Great recipe! I have made this several times with different variations. Adding some fresh grated ginger gives it a nice zip. Another great variation is after cooking the pudding and placing in the bowl to cool, whisk in some powdered coconut milk. Tastes great! I've also used fruits such as pineapple or guava instead of mango, also good.

you need to eat this right away otherwise it get's soggy. I love tapioca pudding but this dish just didn't work for any of us.

Yum! I added extra lime zest, less sugar, more tapioca and naturally more mango! The lime really make this tapioca special. Just like Grandma's, only better!

I didn't find this recipe as wonderful as the others. I used only 1/2 cup sugar and still found it too sweet. I'd use 1/4 cup sugar next time. I used 2% milk and found the texture fine. It smells good.

This was a wonderful summertime desert. I used 1% milk with no problems and added peeled, chopped white peaches with the mango. Very tasty.

The addition of grated lime is very pleasant. I think that 2% milk would work fine. I used 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 1%. The mango beneath was enjoyed by my husband and son and the melted brown sugar is a decadent treat. I will let the pudding get to room temperature the next time I make this before I melt the brown sugar.

This is "a keeper"--a very very nice "comfort food" dessert and so easy to prepare ahead of time!!
