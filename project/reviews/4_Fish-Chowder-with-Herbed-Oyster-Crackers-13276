Made this for a 3rd time last night. DELICIOUS again. Subbed 1 oz. of Jimmy Dean's pre-cooked Turkey Sausage Crumbles for the bacon, 2% milk for the heavy cream, and H/M fish stock for the clam juice. Really enjoyed it with "crusty bread"! (deleted the oyster crackers). Super simple and it didn't put too much heat in the kitchen when it's 100 degrees outside!

This is a delicious, hearty soup. I was worried after reading a few reviews which called it "subtle" or "bland" since we like ethnic foods with strong flavors and I am NOT good at improvising seasonings. I doubled the recipe and used halibut combined with 3/4 pound of canned clams in juice, which gave the soup a very nice meaty texture. For flavor, I left out the bacon, substituted smoked paprika for plain paprika, and added a few shakes of red pepper flakes. I also used only a half-cup of half-and-half and 1.5 cups of low-fat milk in my double recipe, rather than all the cream. Despite being subtle, this soup really was a winner. My husband, who is a pretty discerning chef himself, gushed endlessly about it.

Made this for the 2nd time last night--this time I almost followed the recipe exactly. The few changes: sauteed a minced garlic clove with the other veggies, subbed 2% milk for the cream, added some Oriental red hot pepper sauce for zing. Used mostly flounder (was surprised how well it held up in this soup--I thought it would disintegrate, but it didn't). Added a few pre-cooked shrimp to get the 3/4 lbs. of fish. VERY, VERY YUMMY!!!

This was very good. I don't think it was spectacular, and I would probably cut down on the amount of carrots--the flavor of which seemed to dominate the dish--but it makes a hearty winter dish.

I made this last night, but I used fish stock instead of clam juice and water. I didn't add the cream until the last minute. I didn't want to boil it. I forgot to use the parsley. But, I had thrown in several twigs of thyme earlier. I used two potatoes. Really lovely.

This was delish!!!!! I did make some adjustments thanks to some of the other cooks who have reviewed the recipe. First I cannot find clam juice or canned clams here in Holland. So I substituted 2 fish bouillon cubes in 8oz of hot water, instead of the water in the recipe I used white wine, added 2 cloves of garlic chopped and I added a touch of cayenne. Finally I had shrimp on hand so I added that to the cod. This was a lovely hearty meal with a salad. The basic recipe is a definitely a keeper.

try using fresh -not canned- clam juice. fresh ingridients render a better taste and -of course- sodium

This was easy and good. I doubled the recipe. But, I did trade the water for white wine and cooked the soup longer because by potatoes were chunkier.

I made this tonight as a clam chowder, and would like to give the chowder 5 forks, if I could. Pretty much followed the recipe as written (which is unusual). The few changes I made were: 1) used 5 slices Louis Rich 65% Less Fat Turkey Bacon, 2) used about 3/4 - 1 lb. of potato, 3) used 8 oz. (drained weight) of minced clams, 5 fluid oz. of clam juice plus 3 fluid oz. of baked cod juice (all of these fish products had been frozen forever), 4) used 2% milk instead of heavy cream, 5) added some bottled hot pepper sauce for zing. Had to add a little extra milk at the end, as it seemed a bit thick. THIS IS AWESOME!!! Can't wait to try it with white fish fillets and fresh ingredients!!! (I wouldn't bother with the herbed oyster crackers again. Perhaps the recipe meant the spices to be powdered--my crushed ones did not coat the crackers and sat in glomps over some of the crackers. After baking the crackers they only tasted salty, as the salt I added did mix in with the unsalted butter.) HOWEVER, DO TRY THIS CHOWDER!!!

I have made this chowder twice now, it turned out great both times. I used prawns, scallops and salmon. I also substituted half and half for the cream. Next time I will add some garlic for a little more taste. Overall a very good chowder and easy to make!

I've never made fish chowder before and I thought it would be very heavy. Surprisingly it was very tasty without being too rich. Will definitely make this again!!!

Best soup I've ever tasted.

This is the most beautiful-looking chowder I have ever seen. I made it with halibut and cod, and found the fish to be a little too bland. Next time I'll probably try it with shrimp and salmon. We thought it needed just a little pepping up, and I'll also try it with a little garlic and thyme and a tiny bit of hot sauce added to the chowder. It's a very satisfying and good dish as it is, but I think that just a couple of tweaks would make it terrific.

This was a fantastic recipe. Like most of us, we tweaked this recipe to our liking. For the fish we used 2 swordfish steaks, and also added 2 cloves of garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper and substituted half and half for the heavy cream. I think next time we will do the same and add some scallops. We've never had swordfish in a chowder before and we were kind of skeptical at first to use it. It turned out to be one of the best fish we've ever had in a chowder.

When I first made the chowder it was just so-so. Very pretty, but lacking in flavor which surprised me because of all the cream. Heated the leftovers a few days later, added some salt and it was very, very good. Go figure.

I was introduced to this recipe by a friend, and just had to have it myself, and have passed it on since. Since my husband isn't huge on fish but loves clams, I took BootedBear's suggestion and replaced the fish with 3 cans of baby clams (for a doubled recipe). There was more than enough clam juice from those to supply the recipe's needs, and this made a fantastic clam chowder!

This is one of my favorite recipes and I make it frequently, always with RAVE REVIEWS! We are not meat eaters so we omit the bacon and add a little extra garlic, some leeks, and extra celery. We have so much wonderful seafood to choose from, we often add something new. My favorite is fresh grouper and sometimes some bay scallops. Frozen baby corn or fresh corn is a nice addition as well.This recipe doubles and triples well. Try it, you'll love it!

I don't eat bacon or shellfish (including clams), so I used 1 Tbs. olive oil, 2 Tbs. butter and 1 clove of garlic, minced, to saute the onions to make up for the flavor that bacon drippings would have given the dish. I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of the clam juice and water. Then I used 1 cup regular CoffeeMate and 1 cup of 1% milk instead of the heavy cream and the chowder tasted very rich and creamy without the calories. And then because I had more liquid than the original recipe called for, I added the kernels from 1 ear of fresh corn. I am originally from Boston and was raised on chowders, and this rendition was excellent! I would definitely make it again.

instead of bacon I used proscuitto celery seed(my husband won't eat celery and combined white wine and clam juice to make the 8 ounces also just a few drops of tabisco to taste

I've made this twice with excellent results. The second time I omitted the bacon as one of the guests did not eat pork and it was still very good. Clam juice is preposterously expensive so I bought canned clams for about the same price. Got the juice AND got clams to boot. I threw some into the chowder and froze the rest.

I made the recipe twice. Having no clam juice on hand either time, the first time I substituted white wine and 3 fish bouillon cubes. The second time, I substituted one tin of smoked mussels: fantastic taste! I substituted half & half for the heavy cream, and added 1 clove minced garlic both times. This is definitely on my Great Soups list!
