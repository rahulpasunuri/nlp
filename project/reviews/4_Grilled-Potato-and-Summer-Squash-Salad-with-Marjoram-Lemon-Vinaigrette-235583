Excellent summer entree or side. Only had oregano on hand and used it instead of marjoram. Light and flavorful.

Very good, light summer recipe. Served as a side for some pork chops from the grill. Looking forward to having the leftovers.

Wonderful potato salad and I've made it several times. I also substitute fresh oregano and agree it's best served warm. I might try the grilled red onion suggestion next time to up the veggies.

Very tasty, but next time I'll double the veggies. There's twice the dressing needed, and the final quantity of veggies was relatively small. So rather than decrease the dressing, I suggest increasing the veggies.

As others have noted, surpisingly good -- more than the sum of its parts. There's something very nice about the contrasting textures of the potatoes and squash, and the way the lemon dressing sets them off. I used Yukon Gold fingerlings and yellow crookneck squash (no peppers), cut the squash to match the potato pieces, and substituted oregano for the marjoram. If you have enough grill space and pans/cages there's no reason you can't grill the squash and potatoes at the same time. I agree with other reviewers that this should be served warm. I thought I'd want to add goat cheese, but it was perfect as it was with grilled sausages.

Good recipe. Looked and tasted well. Next time will try to serve warm rather than room temperature- I suspect the potatoes will taste better then. Added grilled sweet onion that workd well. Served this with grilled salmon, red cabbage beet salad, green salad and bread.

This was surprisingly good! I brushed the potatoes and squash with EVOO and a bit of salt and pepper before grilling. That way they didn't stick to the grill and cooked to a beautiful golden-brown, with little crispy edges on the outside. They were were pretty good at this point, but amazing with a bit of the vinaigrette. Next time I'll omit the squash, as I didn't much care for the difference in textures between the squash and potatoes. I think I'll add grilled Vidallia onions instead. Also, I think adding the vinaigrette just before serving is best, so the potatoes keep that little bit of crisp.

For the amount of work required (very little), this salad was surprisingly interesting and attractive. A great alternative to a heavy, starchy side. I didn't get to include the red bell pepper because one of our guests had a strong allergy to bell peppers. However, I added grilled scallions instead. Delicious.

Good, but very time consuming to grill all the vegetables. Would half the amount of olive oil in the vinaigrette

The lemon really does it for this. My dog really loved it too!

perfect! grilling is a great way to keep the squash from getting squishy, and the lemon vinaigrette complemented the veggies perfectly. Used oregano instead of marjoram, otherwise i pretty much followed the recipe, which is very rare for me.

I asked my mom to make this for Fathers Day to accompany Sliced Steak with Corn Salsa, and it was excellent. We substituted parsley for the marjoram so the flavor would go better with the rest of the meal, but there were a couple things I loved about this recipe. She did it all in advance and brought it over to put on the grill, so it was a great make-ahead and travel recipe. Also, she used white and blue fingerlings, plus zuchinni and red bell pepper, so it was a bright, colorful dish that was really pretty on the plate.

Delicious! Refreshing way to use summer squash.. Love that lemon juice. And it's a healthy recipe, too.

I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, but this is a really great side dish for any grilled meal, especially since there are so few veggie sides that are really great with grilled meals. We used one yellow squash and one gigantic patty pan (turban) squash, plus red skinned potatoes. Also used kosher salt, and since we had leftover fresh tarragon, we subbed that for the marjoram. I'll make this one again and again!
