Tried tonight for NYEve, using two lobster tails. While tasty, think the tomato and herbs overpowered the lobster meat( I did take the suggestion and added it at the very end). One issue may have been that many Italian style flavored canned tomatoes contain sugar, as mine did, from Whole Foods(365brand). Next time, I would cut back on the tomatoes, and not use the Italian type suggested. The cayenne did not detract from the flavor, but the sweet heavy tomato sauce did.

First off, if you cook garlic for 10 minutes it will burn. Cook the onion til translucent, add garlic and cook for another minute. Cant believe I followed the recipe first time and wound up scraping burnt garlic into the sink. I happened to have cooked lobster meat and frozen shrimp shells from another meal. Bundled the shrimp shells in cheesecloth and added with the tomatoes. Squeezed the bundle into a strainer over the pot after the 20 min cook time. Followed the advice of other reviewers and added a splash of cognac with the cream. Yum. My husband and I both enjoyed it but were wishing for a little more heat from the beginning. Got the Cayenne heat around the end of the meal. Will try red pepper flakes or a combo next time. Will also make sure to have bread to soak up the sauce. Its an easy recipe if you start off with lobster meat. I will definitely make it again and continue to tinker.

I found this disappointing. Notwithstanding the addition of cognac at the behest of others, I and my guests found this to be pretty bland. Plus, how does the assembly of this make any sense? The fishing expedition to take out the claw and tail meat make no sense. I would do as the prior reviewer did, and just add the meat after you fish out all of the nasty stuff (although I would do it for longer than 5 minutes - I would do 8 or 10).

Lobsters have been on sale here, so I thought I'd splurge on this for my friends. Everyone cleaned their plate and I thought the lobster flavor came through very nicely. I really loved it. I doubled the recipe and that was fine. The only complication I had was that some of my meat wasn't in large enough chunks to scoop out of the sauce midway through. So I reserved the claw meat and added it about 5 minutes before the sauce was done. I kept the tail meat in their shells so it was easy to scoop out. I fed 8 people (with the double recipe) and had a lot left over for dinner tonight!

Had to use lobster tails, and I added a pound of very large shrimp. Bottom line: It was amazing! Next time, I will skip the lobster tails entirely. They were a bit chewy and not as delicate as the shrimp. I'm not sure about using fettuccini. I think a thinner pasta would have worked better perhaps. The lobster and pasta were quarreling in the mouth.

I made this for Christmas Eve for a party of 25 (with several other dishes) after reading all the rave reviews. I was very disappointed! Maybe it was because I just used lobster tails in shells, but I found this dish really lacked flavor in spite of all the fresh herbs. I also didn't include the mint, but upped the garlic.

My husband and I loved this! We used smaller pieces of lobster, and next time I will probably use larger pieces and maybe add some shrimp as well. We also lightened it up a bit with just enough half-and-half to give it a creamy taste -- excellent!

I don't usually give out 4 forks, but this was so quick and delicious. I used shrimp instead of lobster to cut down on time and costs. With shrimp, it is actually an easy weeknight meal. I used fat free half and half instead of the cream to help watch our waistlines before the holidays. It was still wonderful. My fiance practically licked the plate.

Wonderful! What a wonderful combinations of flavours. Used king prawns (shrimp) instead of the lobster which simplfied the making. Also added some swiss brown mushrooms. Kept all the herbs wow.

WOW! Great dish at other cook's suggestions I added a little cognac when I added the cream and the flavors were delicious!! Will make again, and again, and again.

I am going to make this tonight -- I saw two postings about adding cognac -- can anyone tell me when it's best to add it? And about how much? Thanks!

I have been using epicurious recipes and reviewers input for years. So, I thought it time to add my own review. This recipe is amazing! MAKE THIS! I also used more garlic and large lobster tails instead of the whole lobster. I added a few prawns too. I doubled the recipe with no problems! Don't leave out any of the herbs or the cognac...all the flavors are fab. together...enjoy....

MAKE THIS! Your guest will love it. Before I added the liquids to the onion mixture, I added the herbs and cooked for 1 minute to release flavors then added 1 pound of shrimp then the liquids. When shrimp was cooked I took them out...so that they would not get tough. Cooked everything for 20 minutes then added the seafood back to warm thru... SOOOOO GOOOOD. Serve with a nice balsamic salad and some crusty bread. Oh.. use the herbs all of them .. I thought yuck mint.. but all the herbs melded together to create such a wonderful taste.. you do not taste the distinct herbs and do use the lobster shells in the sauce it gave an amazing flavor...

delicious and simple. I added 6 garlic cloves and red pepper flakes, turned out really nice. The whole family, even the picky father loved it and took it to lunch the next day!

This turned out great and it was simple to make! I did make a few changes of coarse. I quadrupled the garlic (I learned that from eating at Carmine's and added an extra lobster(Why not?). We loved it the sauce was excelent! It even made for great leftovers the next day(i made the whole thing for just me and my girfriend).

i'm not sure what i did wrong- we followed the recipe exactly, but i thought the sauce didn't have much flavor and the lobster turned out too rubbery (even though i swear i cooked it only as long as the recipe indicated)

I picked this recipe while vacationing in Maine..fixed it for friends who came to dinner..four adults just about cleaned up entire dish..I added an extra lobster..got 3 soft shelled lobster..used diced tomatoes in a can..found that sauce was quite thin, so added two tablespoons butter & two tablespoons flour (mixed before adding to dish, so I didn't have lumps)..added a little sherry and added just a few red pepper flakes in that I had no cheyenne pepper and I had no mint..added at least a quarter cup of fresh parsley..it really was a special dinner experience..guests raved about it and certainly I would fix it again. It could be that when I was cracking lobster, I held it over dish and there was liquid in the lobster which ended up in the dish which could explain why the end result was too thin; thus the need to add the flour and butter..but it could be it added evem more flavor..the flavor was just wonderful..I cooked lobsters more like five minutes..prior to opening them.

What a wonderful flavor. I boiled my lobsters for 8 min, and followed the recipe exactly except for re-cooking the meat in the sauce for 8 min. Wonderful flavor, the cream mellows the tomatoes....

Very good! Excellent flavors, works well with fresh linguine. I was confused with the adding/removing shells and meat; so this is what I did: I bought cooked lobster, removed the meat from claws & tail. Chopped up the tail and set aside. I added the claw meat and tail shells to the sauce. For the last 5 minutes, I removed the shells and added the tail meat to heat through. I also waited to add basil until this point. I chose this way to not overcook the lobster meat and to preserve the basil. The flavors were great; but will be interested to hear how others did this.

This is a great dish. I used lobster tails only and halved the recipe since it was just for my husband and me. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of canned whole tomatoes. He wants me to make this every week. It's not a difficult recipe. The most time-consuming part is removing the shell. Otherwise, it's easy and so tasty.

simply awesome!... i will definitely make this again - and when i do, i might add just a bit of cognac to this dish in order to make it extra, extra special.... and as involved as one might think this recipe is, it was in reality a breeze to pull together.... so you know, i added a few more cloves of garlic, used 1/2 cup of heavy cream (instead of 1/3 cup whipping cream) and folded-in some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese at the end in order to give this recipe added kick.... again, it was simply out of this world!... comments from my wife: it was so flavorful!... (coming from a pasta lover) she wouldn't alter a thing!... so there you have it!...

My Husband thinks this should be my signature dish! I customized this dish slightly. I deceided to sauté lobster tails instead of the alternative and more time consuming whole lobster. I also favor the fresh taste of chopped and seeded tomatoes. I added them at the end to just heat through. If you like a little zip, add a dash of crushed red pepper. Yum, yum.

This dish is FANTASTIC! I never would have thought that the tastes of rosemary and thyme would compliment lobster! I added shrimp to mine, and skipped the mint. Using fresh stewed tomatoes added a great flavor. Also, I 86'd the tomalley and coral...the broth gets enough flavor from the juices and meat. A nice bottle of wine adds just the right flavor!

Although time consuming to prepare it is extraordinary and very appropriate for a dinner good friends.

This was a great dish although a lot of work. Next time I might try just using lobster tails and some shrimp instead. I also used crushed tomatoes and put the lobster pieces in later. I made the sauce earlier in the day and reheated. Be careful not to overcook the lobster.

This dish is amazing! I don't like to boil the lobster myself, so I have the fish counter at my grocery steam it for me. I made this for a dinner party for friends on a a very strict low fat diet (minus the cream) and they were amazed how delicious it was. I like to put it over a thin red pepper fettucine. Fresh herbs are essential, and I never use the coral or tomalley.

I made this last night and it is super! The herbs really complemented the lobster. This also tops any lobster pasta that I've had at any restaurant (that I've tried!).

Absolutely wonderful-unusual herb combo works perfectly! Be liberal with the tomatoes and cream so you have enough of the sauce. Also, I prefered lobster meat cut in slightly smaller pieces, so it is present until the last few bites - rather than having just a few big pieces...enjoy~

An absolutely amazing dish. This is one of those truly special and memorable dinners. The lobster flavors the sauce in such a wonderful way and the combination of herbs is sublime (I think it's the mint that makes it really special). I did two things differently and that was to saute the onions separately for a few minutes to begin to soften them and I added the fresh basil at the very last moment - you don't want to cook basil too long - it loses its flavor. Try it and you will make it again and again for that special dinner.

This dish is a favorite at our house. I've made it several times and it's wonderful with fresh pasta. I don't add the coral and tomalley though, it's just a personal preference.

This dish was not as fabulous as it should be given the amount of work involved. I guess for me, when it comes to lobster, the simpler the better.

Spicy dish, but not too hot....creamy, but not overly rich- the blending of herbs is amazing. Lobster without the work (lazy man's lobster for guests!) My guests loved this!!!!

I am a native New Englander and am always looking for a really good lobster dish. (Yes, we can get live lobsters in Arkansas!) I made this dish for my husbands birthday and it was just incredible. The fresh herbs make the sauce exquisite - yet it does not overpower the sweetness of the lobster. It truly is worth all of the work that goes into the preparation.

This was the most balanced and flavorfull meal we have had in a very long time. The mixture of hearbs was out of this world. It left us with a feeling of contetment and not that overly full feeling. We are most definately making this dish again, and we may even try to vary a little and use shrimp or scallops instead of lobster. Thank you for making our valentine's dinner one we'll remember for a long time to come. P.S. We had the Louis Roederer Brut Premier Champagne with our dish "OUTSTANDING" Thanks again.
