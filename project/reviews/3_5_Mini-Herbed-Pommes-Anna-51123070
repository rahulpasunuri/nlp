I made these for my husband and myself. I reduced the recipe to 1/4 (3 servings) but used more garlic than called for and made them in two ramekins. They were a big hit - so now I'm making them again for more people and will use the muffin tin. Do you really have to turn them out, then turn them over to cook more, or could you just leave them upside down to get browned? It seems more likely to stay together if they are turned out once.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I made 12 (12 cup muffin pan) and our family of 5 was fighting over them (ages 6-adult)! I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used fresh rosemary instead! Delish!

These were an elegant component of our Thanksgiving dinner. They were easily prepared the day before and had WOW impact at the table. I also used more thyme & garlic.

This is a yummy and relatively simple dish to prepare, particularly since they can be made almost completely in advance. I used more garlic, grated with a microplane, because that's how I roll. I suspect I'll cook these for many dinner guests over the years.

These were good...I made a smaller batch for our Sunday brunch but didn't cut down the garlic...I would add a bunch more garlic next time and some cheese to boost the flavor.
