Wonderful flavor, which lasted for days, and an exceptional holiday dessert with no alcohol in it. I doubled the recipe to fill my plum pudding mold, and it was perfect! Served with sweetened whipped cream.

So good - real hit! Not too heavy either. I added lightly toasted almonds and walnuts and also dates. Instead of regular whole wheat breadcrumbs, I used Galletas (Mexican biscuits). I also added just a touch of nutmeg and vanilla. I also did what other reviewers did and made 9 servings and used a 6 cup dish - perfect size.

I made this today and was pleased with how it came out. I didn't change the ingredients but made 1.5 of the recipe and used a 5c. steamed pudding mold and it was the PERFECT size for that amount. Mine too was done in 1.5hrs. It tasted wonderful with whipped cream. Thanks to the other reviewers for their advice.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was good, but it's not a dessert I would make again. It was easy and more of a novelty dessert and unlikely to become a "standard" at our house.

I have made this recipe for the past 3 years without any changes. My family just loves it! In fact, my mother requested it this year. It is very light and tasty. The perfect way to end a heavy turkey dinner.

People practically swoon over this dessert. Any kind of marmalade works-I use Meyer Lemon from our garden. It almost tastes carmelized and the custard sauce is perfect with it.

Steamed pudding are a new thing for me to make, but I like them so much better than cake...so I thought I would try this. I served it right out of the steamer at the end of an Indian meal I had prepared for friends. I took the advice to make 1.5 of the recipe and it filled most of a six-cup mold. I subbed amarreti crumbs for part of the bread crumbs and added orange rind, a splash of almond extract and some slivered blanched almonds. It got raves. Didn't have time to make a special sauce. Vanilla ice cream was delicious with this. A keeper.

I liked this a lot. I served it with the custard sauce which was delicious, too. This was easy to make, unmolded beautifully and reminded me of my Grandma and Christmases in my youth.

I was looking for a lighter alternative to plum pudding and this sounded just right, given I had a jar of Seville marmalade in the fridge and fresh oranges as well. Easy to make, very simple. I fit better, in my mind, into a four-cup mold -- I actually uses a small pyrex bowl set into the top of a double boiler. Two hours was plenty of time, it turned out very nicely onto the plate, and I ringed it with a raspberry sauce, since I wanted to keep it light and fruity, instead of overly rich with custard. Warmed up an 1/8 cup of brandy, lit it, and poured it over the top for presentation! It got a lot of raves!

I really liked this recipe. It tasted great! I substituted orange juice concentrate for fresh orange juice for a more 'orangey' flavor. It was good. Also, I do agree with other reviewers...The pudding was rather small. Might be best to double or make 1.5 of this recipe to fill out the mold.

Once again, my sister and brother reviewers were right on! This was terrific. Used really good quality marmalade which I am sure is key, and listened to the reviewer who said the batter only filled her too-small mold 2/3 of the way and since I had a 6 1/2 cup mold, I doubled the recipe. I do feel it would have been such a teeny amount if I hadn't that I would always double the recipe in the future. I submerged the mold in a lobster pot and my water didn't really simmer but boiled and it was 3/4 of the way up (I was too lazy to scoop it out when I realized it) and it came out 100% fabulouslyn though it took 20 minutes less(1 hr 40 min.)to cook. The only thing I would do differently next time has to do with the sauce, not the pudding; I don't think creme fraiche is so great on it. I would definitely make the sauce recipe given, or recipe given by one of the reviewers. Oh, and one last thing; the pudding is awesome both hot and cold. My husband hates raisins and dried fruit in desserts and I love steamed puddings; he loved this (although he admits he was dreading trying it) so I plan to make it at Christmas.

This is so good! I made it with all-fruit (no sugar added) marmalade and challah crumbs (lots of leftover challah-now I know what to do with it). I also made it nondairy by using margarine, and soy milk for the custard sauces. My raisins all sunk to the bottom of the mold. I think that next time I will fold them in at the end. Also, some of the pudding stuck when I tried to demold it, but it still tasted great. By the way, the only mold I could find was a 4 cup mold, and that actually was the correct size- it filled about 2/3 full with the batter.

Way too simple to be this good! Also, I was able to cut the cooking (steaming) time to about 45 minutes by pressure cooking... I know it's scary, but try it!

The recipe was very easy to make.I used a rather bland marmelade .In future I will use a good tangy Scottish make.Got raves and will repeat.

Hello Canada...I believe the pudding is steamed on top of the stove over a very low flame - like an old-fashioned bread pudding would be. Hi Texas...the Custard Sauce recipe comes up now when you click on the link.

I haven't made this yet either, but it sounds great. As for sauce, here is what I would serve with it. Mix 1 c. whipped cream with 1/4 - 1/3 c. sour cream, and add 1 T. Grand Marnier. You can add a little grated orange rind if you like. Top your custard with a dollop. I used this on Creme Brule French toast and it was a hit.
