This is phenomonal! I made it for a housewarming party and everyone absolutely loved it! Kids and adults alike. Very easy to make and good as is. We did make the tricolor roasted peppers which was also fantastic,--we didn't serve them together though. No reason, just ended up that way! I will have to make this again as my son loved it!
