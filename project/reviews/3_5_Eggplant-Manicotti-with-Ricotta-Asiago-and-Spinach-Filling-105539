We have made this twice now, and enjoyed it both times. As is, we find this to be a 3.5-star dish, but with the changes we suggest below we think this will be a 4- star dish. If you have a mandolin, use it to evenly and equally slice the eggplant. At 1/3 allow it to bake for closer to 20 minutes. Also, in the future we will peel the eggplant before baking it. We used low fat ricotta cheese, not whole milk, and it turned out fine; it is necessary to drain it for several hours though. We like the nutmeg flavor but recommend perhaps cutting the amount in half. The cayenne pepper is a nice compliment, but can be removed or increased to taste  well leave it out for the foreseeable future. I think with these changes the whole family, including our two year old daughter, will really enjoy this dish. We did not make the sauce, and instead used sauce we made over the summer with garden veggies, so the rating is based solely on the manicotti.

I've made this recipe twice now, the second time i went with some pesto into the mixture as well as some whole roasted pine nuts, super flavor. I did however both times increase the cayanne just a little, and roast the eqqplant for 15 minutes and baked the dish for 30, it wast over done at all it was perfect!i also topped it with munster cheese and allowed that to melt on top it was delicious! I paired it with an oaxacan black bean and quinoa, it made for a nice vegetarian dinner!

I had similar problems as some of the other reviewers with my eggplant not being tender. I also had the misfortune of having short eggplants so I couldn't quite roll them. For the end pieces I ended up making almost a stuffed eggplant. I thought the sauce was amazing and I would make that alone-I did omit the wine for some additional broth. The stuffing is great.

I can only give this 3 forks because the eggplant was not tender. I baked it for 15 minutes. Maybe that wasn't enough time? I used my own sauce. The combination of ingredients in the filling was delicious. I will definitely make this again, but I may try the Eggplant Rollatini recipe for preparing the Eggplant.

Excellent, light, and filling.

The nutmeg in this recipe made it taste more like the vegetable moussaka recipe from epicurious than what I would have expected from an Italian manicotti dish. I would exchange that for garlic salt next time. Also, the sauce was way too time-consuming. Just buy some marinara.

Asiago taste is overpowered by the sauce. Eggplant was crisp around edges. Next time I would either parboil it or brush it with ample olive oil and roast it less. I am going to try it with a Bechamel sauce next time.

With a different sauce this might be a superior dish. The sauce overpowers the filling and eggplant. Next time I will parboil the eggplant slices and use a Bechamel sauce.

This makes a great pasta sauce! It didn't do much for me in the original form, but I've made it twice as a sauce, omitting the carrot pieces and substituting the chicken stock for vegetable. We enjoy eating this poured over polenta!

So fresh and flavorful! Quite time consuming but worth the effort. The leftovers tasted even better the next day!!!!!

We're low "carb"-ing at our house, so this recipe is perfect when craving Italian pasta. Did not make the sauce - I have a wonderful low carb tomato basil sauce I use regularly. Delicioso!! And leftovers are great too.

Delicious recipe! Guest-worthy. Use only the freshest ingredients (including ricotta) & you can't go wrong with the simplicity of ingredients. Recipe is good as written. I cooked the sauce an extra 30 minutes to thicken it, but even then, there was a slightly thin part to it...but no problem! It's delicious to be "slopped up" with a good piece of bread! Beautiful presentation. I grilled the eggplant instead of baking it. Yum.

I have made this dish twice now for dinner parties & people always rave & want seconds. Good main dish if you have any vegetarians coming over.

This recipe didn't do it for me at all. The wine, carrots, and celery in the sauce just tasted odd. I won't be making this again; I'll stick with the Spicy Eggplant Rolls (also on this site).

I made this using Mids jarred meatless sauce and ricotta salata in place of the regular ricotta. I also used some fresh mozzarella and some pesto in the filling. Rave reviews from picky kids and adults alike!

Made this dish with two fat yellow squashes instead of eggplant (pick them by the dozen from garden)and used broccoli in place of spinach. Also added handful of ground meat to sauce. Made it for three and all loved it.

Very good and simple to make. I had no difficulty rolling the eggplant. However, I do think it is critical that you slice the eggplant thinner than the recipe calls for. I also really liked the celery and carrot in the sauce.

My husband, he-who-never-cooks,made this dish for me as a birthday dinner and to my delight was wonderful!He did use manicotti shells instead of the eggplant as quality eggplant can be difficult to get in our town.The kids loved it as much as the adults and for someone that doesn't know where the stove is much less how to use it the recipe was easy although somewhat time consuming.Anybody with a little bit of knowledge of the kitchen should find this recipe not only quick but easy.

This was great! I made a few changes: In the sauce, I left out celery and carrot, added a handful of chopped fresh oregano and used one 15 oz. can of sauce, 1 15 oz can of chopped tomatoes and 1 can of paste. In the filling I added one sauteed link of chicken sausage, (whole foods makes one with spinach, asiago and mushroom...seemed appropriate) and some sauteed garlic. Completely forgot about the cayenne and nutmeg, but didn't miss it. I have to say I had NO trouble with rolling the filling in the slices, and I have the patience of a two-year-old! Enjoy!

Great Italian recipe if you are trying to cut down on pasta.

Yum! My boyfriend said this was one of the best meals I've ever prepared and should be added to my regular repertoire. The only substitution I made was zuchinni for the celery, and I left out the carrots. Any complaints others had about blandness could probably be attributed to not adding enough salt to the sauce. (use at least 1/2 tsp.) I used all organic ingredients, which I think mades a big difference in flavor.

I was very excited about the concept of the eggplant manicotti, but very disapointed with the results. I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't care for the filling at all. There was a bitter taste, which I think resulted from the nutmeg, or from the raw spinach. I have had a similar dish where the eggplant was prepared as a cutlet (breaded and fried) then wrapped around the filling. I think it is worth the extra calories. I will keep looking for a better eggplant manicotti recipe.

This was good, but the sauce was thin and I added tomato paste and would have liked it much more if I ah peeled the eggplant first

After reading the comments I decided to forego wrapping the eggplant around the filling. I thought it sounded like torture! Instead I cubed the eggplant.. put it in ziplock with olive oil and then spread it out on a cookie sheet with some salt and put it in the oven for 13 min. at 350. (like the recipe) Then I made the sauce like the recipe called for and added the eggplant AND olives AND zucchini like suggested by a few others. I actually live overseas and can't get ricotta so I used cottage cheese in it's place... and then put in 1/2 cup parmesan (no asiago here either!) and 1/2 cup feta like someone else suggested. Can't get fresh spinach either so frozen substituted just fine.............. Then I stuffed the manicotti shells by putting the mixture into a ziplock bag and cutting a small whole......... worked like a charm! (also put mozzerella on top! YUM!) It was FABULOUS thanks to all the suggestions from others! That's what I love about this site!

This was delicious and easy to make.

I made this like a vegetable lasagne instead of going through the monotonous task of ''rolling the cheese in the eggplant'' I agree with the reviewer who said to replace half the ricotta with goat cheese. Mine turned out extra good, thanks to that tip!

Very tasty dish! I roasted the eggplant and accidentally burned them. Thought that I had ruined the recipe, but kept going and it still turned out great! Might burn it on purpose next time. Recipe was more time and labor intensive than I originally thought, but worth the effort.

Have made this twice exactly as the receipe says. Everyone thought it was delicious even my husband who normally does not like eggplant. Gave to a friend who substituted high quality jared sauce plus basil. Her family loved it.

I also used low fat ricotta, as the cook from Westlake Village suggested, but I pureed the sauce and used all Parmesano Reggiano, excellent. I also froze the completed Manicotti It was delicious and my guests loved it.

I didn't have time to make the sauce so I just used Ragu and it came out delicious. Can't imagine how good it must taste with the homemade sauce but this was so easy. I used 1/3 Locatelli cheese instead of Assiago which gave it a lot of flavor. Using eggplant instead of pasta lightens the calories. I did have trouble enclosing the ricotta with the eggplant so I just left the ricotta exposed and it came out fine. I suppose you just have to use very large eggplant to get slices large enough to wrap around the cheese. Anyone else have this problem? I did use very thin slices.

I took the suggestions and used zuchini instead of celery and goat cheese along with the ricotta. What I also did that I liked a lot was add some toasted pine nuts to the manicotti mixture. That gave some nice texture to the dish.

This is too much work for too little taste. I recommend that you replace at least half of the ricotta with goat cheese. That substitution really makes this dish pop. Also, where possible, grill the eggplant slices to soften them up. That adds a nice touch. Finally, I never peel my eggplant but I do salt the slices and set them aside for 20 minutes to leach out the bitterness. Wipe them well with paper towels and proceed with the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe. I took a couple of tips from previous cooks (peeled eggplant, sliced them thinner, added zucchini instead of celery) and used veggie stock instead of chicken stock myself. I took the dish to a party and got great compliments, even from some who claim not to like eggplant. Great vegetarian dish. Yum!

This recipe made a very tasty dish. I always like to improve on things, so may I suggest: 1)peel the eggplant to make it a bit easier to eat 2)slice the eggplant a little thinner than the recipe indicates - 1/4" or less 3)add chopped Kalamata olives to the sauce for a bit more punch 4)substitute one zucchini instead of celery for the sauce.

This recipe is fabulous and we are not vegetarian. My husband and I ate half the recipe for one meal and we are not big eaters. The full recipe would be pretty skimpy for 8. I served it with an olive baguette. I used lowfat ricotta and absorbed excess moisture on paper towels. The sauce could be used alone with any pasta or over fish or poultry.

This is a very healthy, delicious recipe. I am going to try it with non-fat ricotta next time I make it. I'm sure you total vegies like Carmel, Reb, and Jan will love it!
