By the way, I cooked my custard 50 minutes, not an hour. I'm glad I checked it, because it would have been over done if cooked any longer.

This was great! The texture is divine! Creamy and dense. I didn't have an orange around, so I omitted the orange part. I'm only giving 3 forks, because I changed the eggs and used 4 whole duck eggs and 3 chicken yolks. I'm pretty sure the duck eggs put it over the top for me. Try them if you can find them! The tip about microwaving the sugar/caramel is great! My sugar didn't disolve or color in 4 minutes, so I put it in longer, and didn't watch it closely. I smelled it burning and then took it out--so my caramel was a tad burnt tasting, but that was entirely my fault. This is a keeper! Next time I'll try it with the orange.

I have made this recipe several times. It is basically a flan with a hint of orange. I usually make my caramel in the microwave in the dish I use to bake the custard in. I use 1/2 cup sugar + 2 Tbs. water and microwave high without stirring for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the MW and tilt the dish so that the carmel coats the sides. No mess to clean and comes out great.

Very good, however had to bake it much much longer than recipe indicated in order to get it to set.

The orange adds a very sophisticated note to an already sophisticated dessert. A perfect twist on a classic!

all i have to say is whoa. this was so wonderful. it had the consistency of flan, but the orange flavor was delicate enough to add an interesting twist.

I made it without the caramel & used the custard as a filling in a tart, with a walnut crust. Delicious!

My In-laws love custards, and I am always trying to find new ways to do this classic dessert. I found this receipe and served it for a birthday dinner. Rave reviews! I changed it slighty - I made it in individual ramekins. Doing it this way increases the number of servings to 10 - but you'll have to make a bit more carmel.
