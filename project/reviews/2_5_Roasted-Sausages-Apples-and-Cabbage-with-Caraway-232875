I loved this. I can't give it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I used it more as a guide. I used more cabbage and onion, Honeycrisp apples, dried thyme, and spicy Italian sausage. It was great! And spicy brown mustard is a great accompaniment, along with the mashed potatoes.

I found this to be delicious - used chicken and apple sausage and a little more vinegar than called for. I did find that the apples started to get soft before the cabbage and onion was done, so I took them out early.

I made this recipe with uncooked breakfast sausage that I baked in the oven for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients. I also added some sliced potatoes. The recipe was delicious and an easy weeknight meal. The only problem was that some of the cabbage got a bit burnt/overcooked. I will make this again.

I had problems similar to some of the other reviewers. My apples were soft but the cabbage was still crunchy. The balsamic vinegar was barely present as a flavor. It was fast and healthy made with chicken sausages but I think next time I would cut the cabbage into smaller pieces and saute it then add the apples and onions & caraway seeds, cook until the vegetables are softened, then add the balsamic and serve with roasted sausages.

We really like this. It is a regular for us. We serve it like they suggest, whole grain mustard & mashed potato on the side.

I've enjoyed this recipe several times. Made it with bratwurst, and love the sweet apples with tart vinegar and cabbage. I add extra apple and toss to coat again half-way through baking to make sure the flavors meld.

Didn't have caraway seeds so I substituted fennel seeds. Used Emeril's smoked chicken/feta sausages. The recipe turned out well, although next time I will use more red cabbage, and add the apples later in the roasting process.

I don't know why so many people don't like this recipe! I doubled it, used smoked chicken apple sausage, and and drizzled everything with the olive oil, spices, and balsamic vineger all combined before roasting. I did add the sausage later as the recipe suggests. We all just loved it, and two people are already wanting the recipe!

who ever came up with this recipe should be banned from the kitchen. I'm wondering if they ever tasted it???

I guess we are alone with Golden, Colorado! We thought it was fabulous! It is one of our regulars. We have it with a variety of sausages, usually something spicy. We eat it with a whole grain dijon. Amazing!

Since there is very little, if any, opportunity for co-mingling of flavors and ingredients, this recipe was doomed to failure from the start. That, and the fact that the one flavoring agent necessary to tie everything together was missing: BACON! Somebody went WAY too cerebral on a classic, comfort food dish.

Like a few other reviewers, we felt like this was just ok. Though I cut everything according the the recipe, the apples were overcooked and the cabbage was undercooked.

I'll stick to my usual variation of this, using sauerkraut in place of fresh red cabbage.

Tried this because we like all the ingredients but it just didn't blend together. Wouldn't bother again.

I loved this! Delicious, and simple to prepare for our supper last night. I used some wonderful chicken / apple sausages, and served with a nice coarse grain horseradish mustard. A real winner!
