I can see why the other reviewers comments didn't like this one, but the key to this one is to bake it until deep golden brown - caramel colored and to keep stirring mixture. the cook time takes longer than this recipe states We love this recipe alone or with a good greek yogurt.

Very disappointing recipe. Would never make again. The hot water made the oats soft and gummy. This made the granola have a bizarre texture. Had to throw out the entire batch. Too bad I doubled it!

This is a bizarre recipe. I make granola regularly (with a different recipe), but thought I would try this recipe. I think the critical flaw is that the recipe calls for soaking the oats in water. The end result after I baked the oat mixture was a disgusting gummy oat mixture. I had to throw it away and go back to my original recipe.
