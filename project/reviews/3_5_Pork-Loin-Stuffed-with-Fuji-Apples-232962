It was good but needed something to make it spectacular. Followed the recipe to a T. Ii think instead of stuffing the pork loin I would marinate it in the wine, apples, raisins and cinammon. The balsamic wine reduction stained the meat. I guess I would use a white balsamic.

This recipe makes for an amazing meal. We ate everything, including the veg and apple peels in the pan. It makes the house smell like autumn too.

I made a few modifications to accommodate what I had on hand, and it was a hit! I used dried cranberries, ruby port, and Honeycrisp apples - the reduction with port was delicious. Another big change was to wrap the roast in bacon, worth the calories. Served with noodles and broccoli. Love.

This was a great hit and much easier to prepare than I had expected. My husband loved it, saying it tasted like a restaurant dish.I omitted the celery because I forgot to buy it, added baby potatoes and added more than a pinch of cinnamon ;-). Delish.

This recipe has great components, but needs some tweaking. Remember, it's very important to season the pork and its ingredients very well. A little tiny pinch is not going to go very far at all and will be disappointing. I added some finely chopped shallots, maple syrup and salt/pepper to the apple/raising stuffing. I also added garlic, the rest of the apples/raisins to the mire poix (celery, onion & carrots) along with some parsley and herbs de provence. I had some thick cut pork chops on hand and threw them right on top of the veggie mixture. Then I blended the liquid from the pan along with the veggie mixture, strained, reduced and added to the sauce. A little apple cider added to the mix would be delicious!!

This wasn't an awful recipe, just disappointing. My fiance and I both thought it was very average, and took a century to cook through all the way.

Don't be fooled by the 3 fork rating--we liked this recipe a lot, but a recipe has to be truly exceptional to get 4 forks. The filling was flavorful, and I think that the veggies in the pan did add some flavor to the pork. I would definitely suggest brining the pork before stuffing it--ours came out incredibly moist and tender. I agree with the other reviewers who said that the pork takes more than 25 minutes to cook. I seared the loin (by the way, it's a loin, NOT a tenderloin) in the cast iron skillet and then placed the veggies under the meat and threw the whole thing in the oven. While pork was resting (because you MUST let it rest!), I put the skillet back on the stove and sauted the veggies. I also added some chicken stock to soften them up a little. By the time the pork was ready, the veggies looked delicious. They were not so edible initially, but after sauteing, they proved to be a wonderful side for the pork. I would definitely suggest making this dish on a nice fall evening.

Soak the raisins in 1/4 cup of the wine.

This seemed like it would have huge flavor but it really didn't. I followed the recipe exactly.

Very gourmet. I will take the recommendation to rub the pork with maple syrup, next time I make this meal. Apples and raisins are a great compliment to the tenderloin, and the sauce is delicious! Next time I will also saute the veggies first, to give them a bit more tenderness. A great side dish is Sunset Magazine's Creamy Cumin-and-Garlic Potato Gratin. Yummy!

Hasnt anybody noticed the ingredients are off on this recipe? The ingredient list calls for 3/4 cup of wine, but the recipe says to soak the raisins in a cup of wine and later reduce the vinegar in the remaining 1/2cup of wine. Thats 1 1/2 cups of wine. So, which is it? Soak the raisins in a 1/4 cup of wine and reduce the remaining half cup, or double up on the total amount? A little help here...

This came out very tasty! Made it for the family and they loved it. I did not alter the ingredients except nixing the celery (don't like it!). I ended up with too many apple pieces to fit inside the two pork loins, though, and ended up dumping them on top of the loins before putting the whole thing in the oven. I also heeded the problem with the bed of veggies yeilding undercooked bottom, so I put the veggies on top instead. I basted it periodically to keep the veggies moist and took it out when the inner temperature of the loins was 150, as stated in the recipe. This was perfect! I will make this again.

Pretty good...required extended cooking time, as other reviewers stated. I also added the balsamic and wine straight into the pan, then strained and reduced after roasting, for a more flavorful sauce. Additionally, I rubbed the tenderloin with maple syrup before salting...mmm. Maybe next time I'll dust the top of the roast with cinnamon as well?

Previous reviewer is right. Turning meat when it has been cooking for 1/2 the time over veggies seems to solve problem. Dish is superb.

This dish was tasty, but the bed of vegetables insulated the bottom of the roast, causing it to remain undercooked while the top of the roast was dry and overdone. Next time I make this, I'll be sure to rotate the roast half-way through for more even cooking, or omit the bed of vegetables (I'm not quite sure how it enhanced the meat).

Another GREAT recipe from Epicurious...my only suggestion would be to change the final meat temperature. I find that if I cook the tenderloin until it hits 140, then let it rest for ten minutes, it hits about 145 by the time it's served--perfectly safe, and MUCH more juicy!

I have made this several times now - everyone likes it and my family has started requesting it at birthdays, etc. I use dried cherries or cranberries instead of raisins, and a Granny Smith apple if I can't get Fuji. I make 2 cuts 1/3 of the way through, open it out like a book (see Cook's Illustrated beef tenderloin recipe). Tie it up with lots of twine (get it wet 1st so it doesn't catch fire!) and sear it on the grill before roasting. I usually end up having to cook it longer than they say and flip it over a couple of times during roasting for more even cooking. The veggies do add to the flavor but I've done it without and it's fine. I make the sauce just as written. Goes well with sweet potatoes for a festive fall / winter dinner.

We added all liquid to the pan as suggested. I would recommend adding wine only, then straining and reducing with vinegar. It received rave reveiws, would definitely make again.

Pretty good recipe. I probably would have added the sauce into roaster, then strain. You sort of loose the flavors of the veg in the roastpan. Tasted very good though. Not quite a 4 fork recipe though.
