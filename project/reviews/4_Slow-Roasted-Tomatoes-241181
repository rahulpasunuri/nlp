This was just amazing. Three of us polished this off as a small side so adjust up as necessary. The rich flavor sun-dried tomatoes and even better. Served with a beautiful ribeye & Fogarty Lexington Meritage -- a perfect complement. Just beautiful!

i love these tomatoes! They are delicious as an hors d'oeuvres or tossed with some fresh mozzarella, basil and orecchiette pasta for dinner. Consider doubling the recipe as a 28-oz can doesn't yield that many tomatoes (maybe 8?).

Insane good. They do take two hours, but the prep time is less than 5 mins, and you can walk away. I have had them at the Watershed restaurant, and these are better, if you can believe that.

I made them last night. I followed everything the recipe asked for (but I may have lowered the over to 300 degrees for the last hour). Really good! The only thing I may do next time is cut the salt maybe by 1/2. I also took each of the tomatoes in the can and sliced them in half, and placed them skin side down on the pyrex.

This was a very simple and delicious dish to make. I used olive oil instead of butter and they turned out amazing. I doubled this recipe and served this at Easter Brunch as a side dish. It was a nice addition to the spinich strata and crab cakes I served as well. This would also be great on toasted french bread as an appetizer or in a cheese sandwich.

This recipe is pretty good, however I've improved upon it slightly to take advantage of fresh summer tomatoes. My variation uses roma tomatoes mainly because their harder and thicker and don't turn into mush. So, take roma tomatoes, cut in half and remove pulp. Lay them on a baking sheet and drizzle generously with good high quality olive oil. Sprinkle with kosher salt or other good sea salt with large crystals. Start the oven at 450 degrees, bake for half an hour. Decrease temp to 400 and bake for half hour. Decrease to 350 and bake for another half an hour. Do this two more times at half-hour intervals decreasing all the way to 250. This will assure that the sugars in the tomatoes are properly caramelized. The results are delicious and it's the first thing that goes during a party. I serve the tomatoes with crostini and goat cheese, or use them instead of fresh tomatoes in a Caprese salad.

Much better with olive oil instead of butter.

These are incredible! My guests and I couldn't stop eating them. I have also served them chopped in a panini with fresh basil and mozarella -- makes a wonderful lunch or brunch. I do substitute olive oil for the butter.

Has anyone tried preserving these? I have a huge amount of summer tomatoes and am looking for a way to save some for winter.

I made these for an Italian themed dinner party and served them as an appetizer. I put a dollop of fresh ricotta on them and sprinkled a little honey dust on them and they were a success! I also used fresh tomatoes and they worked out perfect.

my husband and i had these wonderful tomatoes at the watershed last month. they are perfect as is, but also fun to experiment with. tonight i'm adding garlic and asparagus and serving with gnocchi.

These are simply delicious and packed with tangy tomato flavor. When I have the 2 hours needed for these guys to bake, I'll definitely be making them again!

My husband loves tomatoes so I had to do this at once and the repeat it again and again. We both like it better with olive oil instead of butter and keeping it in the oven for almost 2 hours, although the oven is hot when the tomatoes go inside.

This recipe is so good! The tomatoes are great on burgers, bread, pasta or nothing. I get so many compliments every time I serve these.

This recipe is perfect as is, quick and easy and beautiful and delicious. I am a huge tomato fan but can despair over their pale mealy midwinter selves. This dish changes everything. Yum. Enjoy.

I was roasting the tomatoes (for about 1 hour) following the recipe, I had a knock at the door and surprise guests for dinner. I had saved the liquid from the tomatoes, which I put into the roasting pan, added chopped garlic and sun dried tomatoes in oil. Baked for 15 more minutes as I cooked up some pasta and there was a delicious dinner. With a romaine and chopped vegetable salad and baked apples for dessert. Next time I will use the tomatoes as the recipe, but this was really good.

To all the cooks in the world, Trying to upstage the recipe as stated makes a dull person of Mrs Dent. Review the recipe as stated and then you can add your favorite twist! I think this recipe in its simple form is really good and is a delightfull side to many dishes.

This is a flavorful way to use up fresh tomatos. Try this variation: Cut the tops off of Roma tomatos, place them top up in the cup of a muffin pan and follow this recipe. You will get more evaporation of water and a highly concentrated flavor.

Much better made with fresh cherry tomatoes and with olive oil instead of butter!

One addition to my posted recipe - drizzle with olive oil after sprinkling with mince garlic.

My recipe for slow roasted tomatoes uses small fresh tomatoes cut in half. Sprinkle with minced garlic and salt and pepper, no sugar. Bake at 250 until tomatoes are wrinkly, at least one hour Serve at room temperature. Will keep for several days if not used right away. Delicious!

Great taste and make-ahead easy. Cut tomatoes in half and squeezed out excess liquid before baking.

Exceptional flavor. I was very impressed with how these turned out.

I am a big tomatoe lover and this was a wonderful dish. The deep, rich flavor can go with many other dishes. For the cook in Los Altos Hills, CA, cut fresh tomatoes in half and sprinkle salt, pepper and sugar on cut side. Roast @ 500 degrees for 30-40 minutes.

I also cooked the tomatoes at a much lower temp. 250 degrees for about 2 hours. they were quite tasty but next time I'll try about 20 min less because I would have liked them to be a little juicier.

any idea how one would do this with fresh tomatoes?

Delicious. Pure tomato essence. Oven temperature was too high for me (used 140F / 330C) as tomatoes started burning, therefore time used was longer (about three hours). Make sure to drain all the liquid inside the tomatoes before baking by doing a small cut. Perfect for a Brunch served with egg dishes or simply spread on crusty toasted bread.
