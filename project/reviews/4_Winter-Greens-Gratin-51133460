Incredible! Use only fresh greens (plus 10 oz fresh spinach!) and prepare greens plus panko (rather than softer breadcrumbs) a day ahead of time. Size and shape of your baking dish are significant; a deep, high-sided dish allows you to use 2c crumbs or less. A longer, shallow baker might will require all 3c. I've been making this recipe at least once a fortnight since learning about it. LOVE THIS.

I made this for one of the family's Christmas dinner dishes and everyone loved it. I did not discard the garlic or the thyme and I added red pepper flakes.

I made this for a Chritmas Eve party this year and it was delicious. Even my Dad, who doesn't like green vegetables, liked it. The only change I made was to add 3 oz of proscuitto to the cream sauce. Yum!

This recipe/dish actually tasted better after my friends raved about it. I will make it again but use bagged/chopped greens and ready made breadcrumbs.

I'm really confused as to why this has such bad reviews?! I made this for guests as soon as I got my Bon Apetit mag and they raved! We loved it, truly delicious! The mustard greens give it enough earthy flavors, no need for bacon people. Maybe you have to be a greens lover to really enjoy this? Not sure, but we thought it was fabulous.

Outstanding...labor intensive but worth it ...made for dinner party and guests wanted seconds and thirds...I made it exactly as written - a classic gratin - the greens had great body and the milk/cream combo was very rich and flavorful...be sure to use good quality cheeses and fresh greens.

I didn't try this recipe but just looking at it is labor intensive. I have made michael symon's green gratin from " the chew" talk show and it's great and easy, using prepackaged greens, one bag is approx. 2 bunches, easy and delicious!

I made this recipe with a few modifications. I used 1/2 southern greens mix, 1/4 chard, and a 1/4 spinach. After I cooked the greens I ran them through the food processor to give them a more Indian greens consistency. I doubled the milk mixture and added more flavoring....more garlic, more nutmeg, etc. I also used butter to flavor the topping, not oil. Overall, even with the tweaks it wasn't a knockout.

To Tombelle, because a lot of people rate the recipe without reviewing it.

How do two reviews with 2 forks and one condemnation with zero average out to 2 1/2 forks?

OMG......this is such a labor intensive recipe and very bland. The milk did not seen to thicken in the saucepan. Yes, bacon or something to give it more flavor would help. Also, I tried to get as much water out of the blanched greens as possible but greens still are water laden. Will not make this again.

This would be a lot better with some bacon in it.
