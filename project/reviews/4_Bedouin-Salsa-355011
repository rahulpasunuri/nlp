I guess it's bedouin and not Mexican because of the parsley and not cilantro but it's a lot like native salsa comal you find in Mexican cooking. It is delicious and great on grilled meats too. Mine was hot but not incredibly so and perfect with kabobs, pita and baba ghanoush!

This is the spiciest thing I have made in a very long time-- and I live in Texas and eat a lot of spicy Indian/Thai/Tex Mex/etc.! I love it, but a little is going a long, long way. It's hard to eat on it's own; it's that hot. I can see it blended with sour cream, cream cheese, hummus, or into a sauce or salad dressing to add some heat, and I am going to try to freeze some for later. I used a tiny bit more garlic, onion and parsley than called for, and I added a couple of small mild poblanos from my pathetic garden during the roasting stage. It seems a bit too salty to me, so I'd start with a teaspoon of sea salt and work up the next time. Overall, yum!

This was delicious! I made it for a dinner party to accompany hummus. Great. We used the leftovers the next day to top off corn pudding, chicken and salad. It is so fresh and unusual. Made it exactly as the recipe states.
