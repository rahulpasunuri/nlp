I've never made the full recipe with veal and bacon but I make this all the time with thin cut chicken breasts. I double the spices, use a whole 15 oz. can of chopped tomatoes and sometimes use 2% or 5% Fage Greek yogurt if I want to lighten it up a bit.

I really liked this dish -- very easy to prepare. Next time I would double the sauce. I also added mushrooms and quite liked that.

This was awful. I thought the ingredients might be a strange pairing and I was right.

Very good, however as with other comments, the amount of sauce seems inadequate considering there's 2 1/2 lbs of meat. I ended up adding some additional tomatoes as well as a bit of water.

As with most recipes, I bended it to use what I had on hand. I used boneless chicken thighs, which were wonderful. And I added carrots and celery to the onions. I also used a bit of smoked paprika along with the sweet and hot paprika, which gave it another layer of flavor. Over spaeztle, this was a dish even my picky 8 year old loved. My husband went back for thirds. A true hit with my family.

This is lovely -- I wouldn't change a thing. I thought the sauce had a lovely balance and it went well with the buttered noodles as it crept over the plate. Because veal scallops are pricey (especially for a weeknight dinner), I might try chicken paillards next time.

This is a gorgeous, simple, cool weather dish. Do not substitute low-fat sour cream, however.

excellent. suggest adding 3/4 can of tomatoes, generous with the onions, can use veal stew meat and slice into small strips, serve over spaetzel. follow with strudel. a winner. enjoy.

This is probably a 2.5 fork, it was good comfort food and easy so will make again. Only change was using lowfat sour cream. And it is worth investing in high quality paprikash.

I loved it. But I doctored it up a bit. I put in more tomatoes - like a cup or so. And also a lot more paprika and cayenne. I also made it with Chicken tenders, which makes it easy and fast. I've made this 3 times and everyone has loved it.

I made this for my husband and I and thought it was just okay. I didn't use lard or bacon fat but added garlic, and mushrooms. I served this with a green salad and buttered noodles. Not really worth a repeat. At the least it needs more hot paprika.

Just made this again this week, using pork tenderloin instead of the veal -- and I think I like it even better! A keeper, for sure.

My husband and I both thought this was delicious! Nice that it's so quick. Veal needs to be pounded thinly before cooking (recipe doesn't say to do that; maybe in the US veal scallops are already pounded.) The sauce was wonderful over the accompanying noodles.

It was tasty - the store didn't have veal - I used pork, but my sauce came out a little funny, maybe because I used light sour cream, it almost had a grainy texture...any suggestions?

I enjoyed trying this, tho' I adapted a little for my family so you can take my comments with a grain of salt...used chicken breast cut very thin and omitted hot paprika. Paprika was still a bit much for my kids, but adults enjoyed. I felt the recipe needed more liquid; there was not enough sauce. I've tried other paprikash recipes that I thought had better proportions.

This is absolutely wonderful! As my hubby will not eat veal, I subbed pork medallions, but that was the only substitution. Be sure to use the combination of hot and sweet paprikas... don't just use the generic from the grocery store. Combining the 2 will add a depth of flavor. Tasted just as good as the version my Hungarian friend makes!

This dish is perfect. I love the texture, flavor and the aroma is to die for. I tenderized the veal prior to cooking but I think the cuts of meat I had were not the best. I hope you enjoy it!!!
