Many years ago I made this recipe and many times thereafter. With taste buds preferring a cake that is less than the very sweet cakes today, this is wonderful. It is just sweet enough with an exotic aroma & nice texture. Be careful not to overcook as that will produce a dry cake. To sweeten things up a bit, add vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!

I am a big fan of cardamom and enjoy dense coffe cake type desserts but would have to agree that this cake is a little bland. If I try it again, I may put in additional nuts as one reviewer suggested.

Used light brown sugar instead of white sugar, which amped the flavor. I also added some toasted almonds to the pistachios and incorporated the nuts into the batter, which improved the flavor and texture considerably. Serve w small scoop of chocolate ice cream or sorbet on the side.

Very disappointed in this recipe - followed it exactly. It was bland, had a terrible consistency, and generally a waste of perfectly good ingredients. We ended up throwing out half of it.

Excellent! I have been baking this cake for years. You must check your oven to be sure it is not too hot. I find 35 min or so at 350 to be about right. This is, not what I call a "moist" cake, more like a tea cake. Do take it out of the oven when the cake BEGINS to crack to keep from over baking. The flavor is wonderful!

I found this bland. I couldn't taste the cardamom and didn't like the texture. I have a much simpler cardamom cake recipe without eggs that I love. I will stick with that.

I've consistently gotten rave reviews for this cake and have enjoyed on plenty of occassions myself. You really have to love cardomom to enjoy this cake.

I am not a big lover of sweets/desserts. So, if you also prefer your cake on the savory side and enjoy Indian spices, I think you will agree that this recipe is absolutely fabulous. Wonderful with coffee/tea (afraid that chai would be a bit overkill with the spicing). We also found last night that it is wonderful with a bit of French rose!

This was very delicious. I used salted pistachios and washed them briefly before I added them to the cake. Worked fine.

I made this cake for a predominantly Indian gathering and everyone liked it including myself but I don't think it was unduly special

This is a wonderful addition to by bruch recipe file! My guest loved the unusual combination of cardamom and pistachios. I'm glad I took the time to search out the unsalted psitachios rather than substituting with another nut. Delicious!

I used fat free sour cream instead and sliced almonds instead of pistachio's. The cake was very moist and good - more of a brunch cake than a desert cake. My husband loved it. It would be excellent for brunch. It almost had a coffee cake quality to it.
