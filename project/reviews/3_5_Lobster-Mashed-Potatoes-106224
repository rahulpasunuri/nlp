Great recipe! Who knew that lobster in mashed potatoes was sooooo goooood. I did add a few dashes of garlic powder to the mix.....it was perfect!

8 oz. of lobster for two portions of potatoes is indeed sinful beyond my conscience of carbon footprint--not to mention more than a bit overpowering. Instead, I did this with about 10 oz. of a tail-claw mix, cut into about 1/2 the sizes called for, for generous servings for about 5 (about 3-1/2 lbs. of potates I guess) and this turned out *great*--my 7 year old potato-disliking daughter couldn't get enough. For that portion, also added about 6 cloves of roasted garlic, as suggested earlier.

Typically don't like anything competing with lobster meat besides butter -- however, these mashed potatoes are delicious. Easy to make ahead and heat up in the microwave without the lobster becoming overdone. Great with filets and roasted asparagus.

These are the most decadent mashed potatoes I have ever had. And are absolutely heavenly. If you made them and it turned to slop and was not good, I hate to say, but either you totally screwed up the recipe or you just don't like lobster. I have made these many times (always perfectly wonderful) with the "filet mignon with truffled mushroom ragout" recipe which is also available on this site. Great for anniversary or valentine's dinner for two, a bit expensive and fragile for a large get together.

Wow, I loved this recipe! Served it at a dinner for four and we all agreed that these were the best mashed potatoes that we'd ever had. A bit expensive, but totally worth the effort.

Lovely special occasion (Valentine's Day) side dish. Served with filet mignon with truffled mushroom ragout. Not a huge tarragon fan, so I substituted 2 TBS of chopped parsley (used more b/c parsley's so much milder). Delicious!

Ick. I made these for a surf and turf dinner party, and I also prepared a host of other unique dishes (including a wonderful quinoa salad, as well as the white winter salad, both of which can be found on this site). Of all of the dishes served, these potatoes were the least favored. In fact, some of the guests went so far as to say they really disliked the flavor. I THINK that they might taste better if the potatoes were boiled in clean water, instead of in the lobstered water. Too lobstery-tasting.

This is a decadent dish and definately worth repeating.

These potatoes were the best I've ever eaten. However, I would only do them for a special occasion - since as everyone else said they are expensive.

Although our dinner guests have never experienced lobster mashed potatoes it sounded a lot better than it tasted. We served this to our gourmet club and when serving eight for dinner we made the potaotes ahead of time and then reheated. Once the potatoes were reheated the lobster became overdone. The truffle oil added a lot but to spend all that money on the lobster we all agreed we would have rather dipped the tail in butter than have it in the mashed!

This was very, very good. Very expensive. I served four people with this and the filet mignon with ragout sauce. I made it by following the recipe exactly. One person there was too much tarragon. Another said I should have used more tarragon. The third person said it was just right. When I make this again (when my budget recovers) I will used the amount of tarragon called for in the recipe. I have a feeli8nbg it will never be right for everyone.

My husband and I made these potatoes for our Valentine's day dinner. The best mashed potaoes we've ever had! Yes, they are expensive but well worth it for special occasions. We will definately make them again.

Expensive, yes, but worth it for a special occasion. I accidentally threw out the lobster cooking water and had to use plain water to boil the potatoes. It was still good, but I'm sure it could've been even better. I made the Valentine's menu as suggested, but next time I will just make the lobster mashed potatoes as a main course, served with sauteed vegetables and champagne. Yum!

I'm sorry..but I have problems putting a beautiful lobster tail with mashed potatoes. Lobster can be quite expensive where I live....and I'm on the west coast! The recipe may have been delicious....but you don't have to break the bank to have good food!!!

Excellent! I also made the entire menu (filet mignon with truffled mushroom ragout)for Valentine's Day. Since I used dry tarragon in place of fresh, I cut down the amount by half. Both my husband and I thought it was a bit too much, so the next time I will reduce it even more. I also substitued skim milk in place of the whole milk and was unable to tell any difference.

This was so good and a perfect accompaniment to filet mignon with mushroom ragout. Next time, I will try adding a little more tarragon.

I made the entire Valentine's Day menu for my husband and, while everything was delicious, my husband is still raving about the mashed potatoes. This is definitely a keeper.
