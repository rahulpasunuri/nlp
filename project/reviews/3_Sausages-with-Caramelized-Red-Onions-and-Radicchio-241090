Whether you like this or not solely depends on if you like bitter greens. I made this as written with the exception that I used a gouda-apple sausage from Niman Ranch (so good even on its own!!). I enjoyed the bitterness of the radicchio, my boyfriend did not. I would make this again - but I would use 3 red onions, 1 head of radicchio. I think a grilled pork tenderloin would be very good with this. Great fall meal with a nice brown ale or octoberfest!

Loved this recipe. I also make it with pork tenderloin. The combination of sweet and bitter is perfect. Don't listen to the negative reviews if you like bitter greens.

Seeing the reviews - I skipped the Radicchio and used red cabbage. I believe with much better results.

wow, this was really bad. I couldn't eat it! I was suprised at how much I disliked the radicchio, spoiled my wonderful carmelized onions.

I usually like the bitterness of radicchio, but in this dish it completely overpowered everything else. If I were to make this recipe again, which I won't, I would halve the amount of radicchio like the other reviewers said.

This is a great weeknight meal. Didn't have chicken sausages so used pork-apple sausages instead. The flavors were great and it is very quick. Next time I might halve the amount of raddichio and add some other veggies.

This recipe gave me a great starting point, but I pretty much did my own thing. Any sauted veggies work with this recipe. With the onions I added brussesls sprouts and baby portabellas. DELICIOUS!

I just made this and it was very good. I'm not a big radicchio fan because I find it very bitter. I ended up adding 2 tsp of sugar to the finished product. I'll make it again because it was easy.

Caramelized onions were very good, but think I'd use less radicchio if I did make again. Could be my radicchio was a little on the tired side coming over to Hawaii. Served with walnut bread and homemade onion marmalade to which I added some toasted walnuts; threw rest of nuts on top of sausage and onion mixture.
