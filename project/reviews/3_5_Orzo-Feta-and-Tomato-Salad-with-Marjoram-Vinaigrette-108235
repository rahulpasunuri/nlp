I used a mixture of thyme & oregano instead of marjoram (don't have it in my garden.) Great side dish to grilled chicken. Happy I have leftovers for lunch!

this is a perfectly good recipe, especially for people like me who have marjoram and lemon growing in the yard! It's not some kind of amazing culinary breakthrough, but you can take it to your potluck with your head held high. I happened to take it to a potluck where there were FOUR other dishes that looked just like it. It's that kind of dish.

I made this recipe yesterday for a family barbecue. As several previous reviewers did, I also substituted parsley for the marjoram as I have never had marjoram before and I wasn't sure if everyone would like it. It tasted great with the parsley, and I might try it with marjoram next time. I also made about 1.5 times the dressing amount and saved some for right before serving. I think adding some marinated artichokes would be great too, but the recipe itself was well received as is. Give it a try!

I really wanted to like this, but about the best I can say is that it used up things from the CSA box that needed to be used. It just doesn't taste like much.

My kids ask for this again and again. Everyone asks for the recipe. Great for picnic or bbq. Holds up well in the heat

I've made this at least a half dozen times, often as a covered dish to bring to a BBQ. Everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe. The fresh marjoram really makes it, don't skimp!

Used fresh thyme and sage and it tasted great. Paired with swordfish kabobs.

Great, added a few of my own ingredience such as sundried tomatos and chopped spinage to add green, used 12 oz of orzo and the dressing seemed to be perfect with the oil from the sundried tomatoes. I will used this again and again! Maybe even add chicken to make it a full meal.

I made this as part of a buffet luncheon for a bridal shower. It was great to make the day before and just add the tomatoes and additional dressing the day of. I would agree that it needs more dressing than the recipe calls for. It is a very dry salad. I used 3 tbsp. of dried oregano instead of marjoram.

I used a bit less olive and tomato but otherwise followd the recipe, and I like it. It could have used a tad bit more dressing. This would be great topped with grilled shrimp.

Excellent! My husband says he hates orzo and this time said he loved the dish. Served with cedar plank grilled salmon and corn on the cob with chipotle butter. Yummy!

This is a delicious salad and the marjoram really makes it. The only thing I changed was using canola oil instead of olive oil. It's very important to serve this at room temp. so the flavors really stand out.

I have not made this, but the Tomato and Corn Salad with Marjoram on this website is Four Forks, as far as I am concerned. The marjoram may be an acquired taste but my family loves this salad.

This dish pairs perfectly with GRILLED CHICKEN MOROCCAN STYLE (recipe on this site). Great dinner that can mostly be prepared ahead of time for easy entertaining. The fresh marjoram is a must- don't change a thing.

My friend turned me on to this versatile recipe. Thanks, Kim! I like to make it with Italian flat leaf parsley instead of the marjoram, use garlic feta and Meyer lemon juice. I also like to add artichoke hearts and garlic stuffed olives. Sometimes I substitute baby fresh mozzarella balls for the feta. Have fun with this recipe and try many combos, it's a great base.

This is one of my favorite all-time recipes. Great in the summer (reserve the tomatoes if you plan on microwaving) and just as good without the olives, if you don't like them. Very healthy and delicious.

I made this recipe last night and my family loved it. I did follow some suggestions by the other reviewers such as adding garlic and red wine vinegar (1 Tsp) and using parsley instead of the marjoram in the vinaigrette. I also added roasted asparagus to the salad. This is a keeper and I plan to make it a lot this summer.

I've made this a couple of times, and it always goes over really well. Based on other reviews, I halve the amount of marjoram, so that it's not too overpowering. Great dish, and easy to make!

This is a big hit at our house and at parties. I used dried oregano instead of the marjoram. The first time I tried the recipe I included the grated lemon peel that the recipe calls for but I felt that the flavor was overpowering. I skipped it the next time I made it and the flavor was more balanced. Excellent dish. Makes good leftovers too!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I make it all the time. Hiwever, I have found thyme to be a great substitute for marjoram. Afterall, who couldn't use a bit more thyme?

Didn't put in the olives because I thought it would be too salty with them and the feta. Used some chopped baby spincah for color. Liked it very much, especially the lemon zest.

This was excellent. There was no fresh marjoram so I took the other reviewer's advice and used fresh parsley instead. It was just what you'd want it to be - an interesting, refreshing, delicious, pretty pasta salad.

This is a summertime favorite. I usually add some fresh garlic to the vinagrette, as well as a touch of red wine vinegar. Lots of fresh black pepper. Also, it's great with roasted asparagus tossed in as well. Just roast the asapragus at 400 for about 15 minutes, then cool and cut into one inch long peices. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe several times, exactly as written, and my family and guests haved all loved it. I didn't find the marjoram taste strong at all. I think it complements all the other ingredients. Great make aheat dish!

I disliked this, and so did my 5 dinner guests. It wasn't very exciting, and I think the marjoram gave the salad a strange taste. I want to try the Gourmet salad that everyone else is comparing this to. Hope it's a bigger hit.

I really love orzo and this salad has an amazing amount of flavors. I didn't have fresh marjoram and used fresh rosemary instead. I agree with the other reviewers, the salad definitely tastes better over time.

I have made this salad four times and always get compliments. The key is not to use fresh marjoram, but use fresh dill. I tried it with marjoram and hated it. I tried it again with dill and loved it. It is easy to make for a potluck. But make sure to make it well before serving. It tastes much better after sitting.

This is a very nice addition to a summer meal, or to a picnic. I also added cucumbers and since I didn't have marjoram in my garden, I used fresh oregano, basil and Italian parsley. The herbs gave it a nice fresh flavor. I also added some home made vinagrette for additional moistness.

This is a delightful summer salad and goes with just about everything. I probably added a bit more feta - Greek variety is always best in my opinion. I also used nicoise olives and I beleve it calls for Kalamatas. I find nicoises have more punch. I made it for company and got rave reviews. It lasts very well in the fridge and gets better as it "steeps". This is a winner.

The cook from Toronto took the words right out of my mouth. The other orzo recipe she/he mentioned is MUCH better. (I think pine nuts are the secret). I guess I'm just not as big a fan of marjoram as I thought I was.

Not too special, I agree. A much better pick, in my opinion, is Gourmet's '99 recipe, Orzo with Feta and Cherry Tomatoes. It's not any more difficult to make, but a lot tastier.

Refreshing, super tasty & very easy. I might add chopped cucumber to the next batch. As is, this is a fabulous salad!

This is a great summer meal salad- I made no changes but would suggest letting it sit for a couple of hours before serving it so the flavours meld together.

Rating: 3
This was very good but I did make a few changes: used 1 tsp dried oregano instead of fresh marjoram; used only 1/2 tsp lemon peel; used a basil-tomato flavored feta; doubled both the green onion and the olive amounts. It was very refreshing with a light lemon-oregano flavor. It keeps well too -- still tasted great several days later.

This recipe is pretty good, but is a little bland. I suggest making more of the dressing and letting the salad sit overnight in the fridge before adding the tomatoes. I took it to a pot luck barbeque and did get a ton of compliments on it.

Nothing tasty or special. Too much marjoram for my taste.

Delightful alternative to regular cold salads. I made it the day before...probably could've added the tomatoes then as well. I couldn't find cherry but used grape tomatoes instead, which were delicious. Will definitely make it again. Maybe try the tomato basil feta next time?!

A very light and refreshing salad. I used less marjoram since I don't care for the strong flavor. Don't serve this too quickly - it needs a few hours to allow the flavors to blend. I enjoyed it the most the next day.

I made this for my family and not a one liked it. Most said it was bland. I've made something like it before with no marjoram and with vinegar instead of dijon and it was better received. Oh well. Everyone has their own tastes.
