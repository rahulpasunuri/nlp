Whoa - gross... and I'm hard pressed to find a potato salad that I haven't loved. I guess I find it's hard to improve on the classic... My biggest departure has been Yukons, chives and dill - with clssic mayo, & touches of sugar and vinegar.

I made this recently for a bunch of friends for steak night. Everyone loved it except for my husband. It just gets better with age!
