Great recipe for holiday dinners because they can be made ahead. I served this with a standing rib roast for Christmas dinner two years in a row...everybody raved.

These were a huge hit such a huge hit at Christmas dinner I'm making them again, with a standing rib roasr. Even non-goat-cheese-lovers were crazy about this. Use a decent European goat cheese. A little gralic never hurts. Food this good shouldn't be this easy!

These are like clouds of homey perfection with a splattering of dignified flavour. The goat cheese is profound and fantastically paired with the potatoes. I like to add a head of roasted garlic. Everyone I've served these to has exploded with compliments.

I have not made this version, but in the ones I make I add blue cheese-preferably Maytag Blue if you can get it. Much more flavor than Havarti or cheddar. Gives some zing.

I wasn't thrilled, surprising based on the number of reviews and forks. Good, but simply tasted like potatoes mixed with goat cheese. (I did use herbed goat cheese but did not add extra of everything.) Next time I might try another take on the potatoes the old fashioned way - bacon or ham, sour cream and a sharp cheddar, or maybe smoked cheese

Very good recipe. I added a bit of nutmeg on top and thought it worked well.

A wonderful recipe to use your fresh chives in the garden. Found goats cheese to be so soft that it could be blended without shreading the cheese. Be sure to use a tip that is much bigger than the chopped chives.

Excellent potatoes. I made this for my wife's birthday dinner with fillet mignon and lobster tails. Everyone talked about the potatoes more than the steak and lobster - a really big hit and definitely something to do again - Soon.

The potatoes took longer to soften but I think b/c they were large. Otherwise, super easy and delish!

Yummmmm! As suggested by other reviewers, I was a little more generous with the goat cheese and butter than the recipe called for, but not much. I opted for sanity over cosmetic detail and skipped the pastry bag entanglement  they looked more rustic, but still very nice with a nice, fluffy, goldeny-tipped surface!

Yuuuum! I made this recipe for an Easter dinner, but instead of cutting the potatoes long-ways, I sliced off the top1/4, and a tiny bit off the bottom, and stood them upright, like an Easter Egg! They looked really cute, and everyone loved them. However, word to the wise, really make sure the filling is SUPER smooth, otherwise you will end up with a huge mess & an exploded pastry bag, like I did (lumps clogged the pastry bag). This wasn't quite as easy as some said it was, but worth the effort & it gave a beautiful presentation.

they were really good but took longer to bake than the recipe indicated. It was closer to one hour plus twenty minutes.

These were very easy to prepare. I added some sour cream, extra butter and a little whole milk. They were creamy - melt in your mouth delicious.

I was inspired by the abundance of yams in the grocery store, so I made this recipe with half baking potatoes and half sweet potatoes. I seasoned the mixture with a lot of pepper and parsley (in lieu of chives). I sprinkled the tops with paprika before the second baking, mainly for the color. Very happy with how they turned out!

These are so easy and so marvelous. I will make them forever! I added raw garlic. Next time I'll try roasted garlic. We loved them!

Followed the recipe. I cut the potatoes in half (top to bottom, not side to side) and put the "shells" in cupcake tins, refilled them and put the refilled potatoes under the broiler. They look great.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful dish for any occasion, and works well for an important dinner party. It can be totally prepared in advance. It's easy to serve plated from the kitchen. It makes great leftovers. (In fact, there's always leftovers because all the mashed filling won't fit back into the shells.)

I'm not going to bother rating this recipe, because I haven't cooked from it before -- but I have been making something similar for years, and wanted to add a tip for y'all. It makes life much easier if you wrap the taters in tinfoil after cutting the tops off and before scooping the innards out. That way it isn't such a big deal if the skin tears. You can do the second baking with the tinfoil or without, it doesn't matter. Also, it's nice to finish these tasty suckers under the broiler, so they get crispy on top. Enjoy!

Pretty good. First time using goat cheese w/ potatoes. The two go well w/ each other. However, I would definently add salt to the filling..maybe with a pinch of dill OR cayene to add flavor.

Rating: 4
Wow. I added a 4 oz package of goat cheese and some white cheddar cheese. Be sure to just stir the potatoes to combine. Too much mashing action will make them heavy. Enjoy these babies!

Rating: 4
The most delicious potatoes I have ever had!! I could eat them every day! Because I love goat cheese, I doubled the amount of cheese, however, the flavor was not even slightly overwhelming. After piping the potatoe mixture into the skins, I brushed the piped mixture lightly with butter before baking the second time, so that just the tip of the piped potatoes turned golden....beautiful presentation.

Delicious. Wonderful. I used extra cheese, too, just because the kind I like comes in 4 oz. tubes. It was so yummy. I will definitely make these again. Easy weeknight meal when paired with a salad.

I have never made twice-baked potatoes before. Easy to make an soo dilicious. I put more goat cheese in than the recipe called for and I am glad I did. My guests really thought this was first rate.

Mt grandma made these for christmas with cheddar cheese, and they were great! I decided to make them last night with a variation - since I live alone, it seemed like a waste of time to be so careful about making them look nice. I just mashed all of the potatos, mixed the ingredients, and baked it as sort of a casserole -- tasted great! Kind of like mashed potatos au gratin

I made these potatoes for Christmas dinner along with the Herb Crusted Tenderloin and they were delicious! Even those who claimed not to like goat cheese loved these. One very thankful guest devoured three of these potatoes! I did slightly increase the quantity of the goat cheese, and used herbed goat cheese as other reviewers suggested.

I made this for a really important (week night) business dinner. I had to make everything ahead so I was grateful for this recipe. I used chevre and everyone loved the potatoes. The kids gobbled up all the leftovers.

I LOVE this recipe! I have made it for family and friends with rave reviews every time. I actually increase the goat cheese a bit, since we love that tangy flavor, but it is perfect as it. I will continue to make this time and time again!

Made this twice - the first time I used Boursin as suggested, it was okay but not great. The second time I used half goat cheese and half Boursin, and added some crumbled cooked bacon. Fantastic! Simple yet elegant. Twice baked potatoes always seem to wow the dinner guests!

I made these potatoes for Mother's Day to go with the Roast New York Strip Loin w/ Garlic-Herb Crust (See epicurious recipe). They were the perfect compliment. All my guest finished them - skins and all! They are so easy to make - I even did the fancy piping on top! It was so nice to have something to make they day before and just heat before serving!

Rating: 3
Big plus about this dish is that it can be prepared ahead and doesn't take a lot of effort. I made this using Boursin for the cheese, added enough cream to make the filling a nice consistency and left out the butter (I thought it was a little overdone with the fat). Spooned filling into the potato and sprinkled with parmesan cheese before baking. Easy and good!

I've made these potatoes several times now, and everyone has loved them - even my friend's 3 year old daughter. I also use herbed goat cheese, gives a little extra kick. Simply, quick, and tasty - goes with any kind of meat.

Rating: 3
Delicious, but still mashed spuds, so, no 4 forks. (how can you go wrong with cheese, cream, and butter mixed with potatoes?!?!) Try using herbed boursin for a nice variation.

Rating: 4
These were a huge hit with the diners and with the cook -- easy to make! I used Chevretine feta, which came in a 7-oz. package, as I thought 5.5 oz. would be too little. The flavor was just right, a sort-of mysterious tang that didn't panic anyone averse to the thought of goat cheese, but that also was more sophisticated and interesting than plain old baked.

Rating: 4
I love twice baked potatoes; however, I didn't have goat cheese. So, I used a very sharp cheddar cheese and a clove of baked garlic, with lots of black pepper; and instead of using chives, I used fresh parsley. I am a taster; so, the potatoe mixture was very good.

We made these to go with a Chateaubriand that we served on New Year's Eve. They were excellent and we got many requests for the recipe.

Delicious! I threw a head of garlic in with the potatoes while I was baking them....took the same amount of time to roast the garlic as it did to bake the potatoes. Used fat free half & half, herbed goat cheese, the whole head of roasted garlic cloves, chives, salt, pepper and a handful of cheddar cheese. Then sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes before cooking the additional 20 minutes! Very creamy and the melted cheese on top MADE the whole thing! These are being added to our weekly menu! So GOOD and Easy!

Was hungry for a baked potato, but not in the mood for ordinary. This recipe was delicious and easy to make. Used feta. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. Everyone raved about these potatoes, and there was quite a discussion who would take home the leftovers. However, I didn't care for them. I thought they were too bland, with not enough spice. But since they were such a popular item this year, I'm sure I'll make them again. Maybe next time I'll just add something extra to give it a bit of a punch to it.

De-lish! I don't particularly care for baked potatoes in any form, but this was wonderful.

Yummy! Everyone loved these potatoes alongside a bread and cheese fondue. Made them 1 day ahead and reheated them half an hour before dinner. Next time I make them I will try a herbed or pepper goat cheese.

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this dish. I made some changes because I didn't think it tasted rich enough: I used about 8 oz. of goat cheese, a lot more half & half, and also increased the butter. This also made it easier to pipe at the end, using the pastry bag.

This is the best recipe for mashed potatoes ever. I made this for my 3rd wedding anniversary and my husband and I loved them. I followed the directions exactly, ecxept I didn't use the pastry thing to make pretty ridges on top. The homemade method of scooping looked very nice & rustic.

These potatoes are awesome! I made them for a Mother's Day gathering of 18, and everyone raved at how good they were. Even my 94 year old grandmother said they were the best potatoes she's ever had! They were so easy to make, and the fact that I could make them a day ahead of time meant less time in the kitchen the day of the party. Great served with grilled tenderloin steaks, and roasted vegetables!

Great recipe. Easy to make and delicious. The goat cheese is mild yet it adds just enough flavor. This one's a keeper...

I used finely minced fresh rosemary instead of chives - a great "make-ahead" side. All my dinner guests wanted to know what was in them - the goat cheese is an unexpected flavor for a "baked potato". They demolished every bite. I always like to have a unique dish that can be made in advance - this is a good one.

Rating: 4
This recipie takes time, but is not a hard one to make. The mixture that is put inside of the potatoes also makes good mashed potatoes. This is also a good recipie when hosting a party because once you put the mixture back into the potatoes, you can refridgerate one day ahead.

We served these potatoes as a "substitution" potato in our restaurant for New Year's Eve. We put a $1.50 cost on these and sold out! We're considering putting them on our regular menu.

I loved these and so did most of my guests, even the kids! Yummy! What a delicious creamy taste they had, yet if I hadn't made them, I never would have known goat cheese was in them. I served these with our Christmas Eve dinner, and I loved the fact that I could make them ahead of time and then just pop them in the oven 20 mins. before serving them. The presentation is very pretty too with the piping. I will make these again.

As a man who enjoys cooking, this was tried at our Thanksgiving Dinner. I made them a day ahead, served 'em up, and everyone loved them. I'm glad I made some extras!

Very easy to make ahead of time and pop them in the oven just before you are ready to eat. Great quality in a side dish when you have company arriving and no time to fuss on the side dish. BI was able to prepare ahead of time and pipe the potatoes into the shell with a pastry bag; everyone was very impressed with the beautiful presentation and delectably creamy taste!

Wonderful dish! Very creamy and richly flavored. My mother-in-law dislikes goat cheese but she loved these potatoes.

These are the best twice-baked potatoes I've ever had. And the only potatoes my picky husband didn't add extra butter to! Easy to make ahead and pop into the oven before serving. And I even made them for Thanksgiving as a make-ahead casserole (sans the skins) and they came out great. Definitely a keeper.
