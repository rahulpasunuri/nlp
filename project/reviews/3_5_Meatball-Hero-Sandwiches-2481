My wife loves these sandwiches with one twist.... we use equal amounts of ground beef and spicy sausage instead of all beef. It is important to have a good bread, too, such as a fresh hoagie roll. The leftover meatballs don't last long either.

On Mondays, we have soup and sandwiches and this was a huge hit with the family. Melted a little provolone under the broiler just before serving. Used Special K instead of cornflakes because that was what was on hand. Great winter by the fireplace sandwich.

I thought these meatballs were great, if a little strong on the oregano. Next time I'll probably use 2.5tsp of _fresh_ minced oregano since my oregano plant is prolific and that would cut back on the amount. My only changes were using bread crumbs instead of cornflakes and baguettes for the bread. I always like to have a yield number on a recipe since I'm not great at eyeballing sizes...I filled a pan with 15 meatballs but I think mine were more like 1.75" so I would suggest aiming for 18 meatballs.

I wish I could review this recipe without rating it, like in the old days, but OH WELL. I only used the method for melting the cheese, atop the halved meatballs. atop the pressed hoagie rolls. The sandwiches turned out surprisingly well. I used Trader Joe's frozen mini-meatballs, simmered in the Quick Tomato Sauce from "Family Cookbook" (Cook's Illustrated). I hate to buy marinara sce when I have the time to make my own (even more, when I don't have any!). We don't see meatball hero sandwiches in my part of Seattle very often, so I have nothing to compare them to. But thanks to this recipe, I now know how to assemble them.

Very good meatballs. I added some quartered green peppers to the sauce and simmered them until soft. I also made a homemade sauce rather than store bought.

I really liked these. So did the boyfriend. I didn't change anything except added some grated onion. I only baked for 17 minutes since I was planning on simmering in my homemade marinara sauce all day. They were delish. I just wish I had made more.

I made these for my picky daughters without simmering in the sauce. Even dry they were delicious.

This recipe is great! We used bison (buffalo) meat instead of beef and cut out the Parmesan cheese to lighten it up. Also used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes (didn't have any on hand) - it was wonderful! We will make it again and again!

So good!! I had some leftover ground beef to use up, and wanted something aside from meatloaf, so thought this sounded good... wow. Easy breezy weeknight meal for my husband and I, loved it! Just bought some of those sturdy buns, popped them into the oven w/ tinfoil to go with the oven baked fries I made, and voila. Will probably put this meal into the rotation so I'll have it again in a few weeks!

does anyone know if this can be made without the cheese, or if it can be replaced with anything?

very good meatballs, used panko instead of corn flakes as I didn't have them. I will make these again.

This is a great recipe. So easy to make and the whole family loved it! I used freshly grated Parmesan cheese rather than the powder type stuff.

My husband loved these meatballs. His only request was to use less garlic next time, but that's probably my fault -- I used quite large cloves. He wants this to be my regular meatball recipe for subs and spaghetti. I will definitely be making this one again!

This one received rave reviews. Substituted japanese breadcrumbs in place of the corn flakes. Baking the meatballs, rather than pan frying, makes this a very easy dish to prepare. Served these on mini sub buns toasted with a little butter and added shredded jalapeno jack cheese on top.

Simple and absolutlely delicious. I used breadcrumbs I already had instead of cornflakes and added a ton of garlic. Melt grated mozzarella cheese on top at the last minute.

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in your magazine. My family has always loved these meatballs. I serve them as an appetizer in a thick homemade spaghetti sauce. I went to make them this morning and could not find my copy. I was so glad that I was able to find it on this site

These were wonderful!!! We bought fresh italian rolls to use (you need to have the fresh, soft ones). I will definitely be making these again. We substituted breadcrumbs for cornflakes - that was the only change.

I made these sandwiches for our Gourmet Dinner Group last weekend. Our theme was wine tasting with a gourmet picnic flair. The couple that ended up with these sandwiches loved them along with the Lemon Pasta Salad with Tomatoes and Feta Cheese. Even though I did not get a chance to sample them that evening it made several for leftovers the next day.

i grated an onion into the mix, substituted bread crumbs for corn flakes and added some crushed red pepper to the meatballs (because i like it spicy!). i also toasted the rolls into garlic bread and added a slice of provelone to the top. they were delicious.

Delicious meatballs. Add a slice or two of cheese on top and a few dashes of Tabasco sauce and all is well.

These were delicious meatballs and a great sandwich. I used a mix of ground turkey and hamburger, grated 1 small onion into the mix and followed the rest of the meatball recipe. I baked the meatballs on a cookie rack like another reviewer and liked the result. The meatballs were made in the early afternoon and so I left them in a closed container on the counter til dinner. The sandwich buns were split and the meatballs placed inside and then they were heated about 8 min. in the pre heated oven. The sauce was heated in a pan and added after along with some grated mozzerella cheese. They were tasty without being too sloppy.

This recipe made the most amazingly delicious meatballs I have ever had. I used a mixture of ground beef/pork/veal instead of just beef. This recipe beats my mom's and my grandmom's meatball recipe - hands down. Easy too. Good bread, wine and a salad and its a perfect casual meal

I was looking for something new to make for dinner and decide to try making meatball sandwiches. I thought they were tender and had a good flavor. My husband wants me to try them in my spaghetti sauce! Yum yum!!

I made these last week for dinner - good! There are just two of us so I halfed the recipe. Next time, I may fry vs bake.. I would have liked them a little more crispy maybe ? I like meatballs fried vs baked - I will make these again!

Added fresh cilantro instead of parsley (chalk it up to "Friday night" cooking) but still turned out yummy! Great in subs and on spaghetti.

These were very tasty meatballs! I also substituted the corn flakes for 1/3 cup breadcrumbs, adding some minced onion too. I used them with spaghetti rather than making sandwiches, and my fiancee pronounced them delicious. I would certainly make them again.

Delicious meatballs! I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting fresh breadcrumbs for the cornflakes. Definitely a keeper.

I am a good cook, but my one weakness is meatballs. Never can get it right. This is by far the best meatball recipe every. They were moist, yet not mushy, and far from dry. It was a big hit with the family. I love the cornflakes instead of bread crumbs. Gives it a unique flavor. Thumbs UP!

A good, all-purpose meatball recipe. Make smaller meatballs for big parties.

This is delicious, and very easy to make. Our favorite Italian restaurant also has a market, so I didn't have to experiment with store-bought marinara or go to the trouble of making my own. The cook from Pittsburgh was right about the cole slaw--its wonderful on top of the sandwich! In fact, I plan to have cole slaw handy every time I make this dish, and this will probably become one of our Friday night staples.

My family loved these! The meatballs were very moist and rich. I balanced the richness with a tangy coleslaw. Try it on top of the sandwich, it's delicious!

I prepared the meatballs to go in a red sauce. They are very tasty and go well with pasta. I like baking meatballs instead of pan frying.

Would prefer meatballs to be a bit larger (2 to 2 1/2"). I used my own homemade marinara sauce and the sandwich was delicious.
