This is a keeper! Our family and friends loved it! We used wood charcoal and wood chips, and the combination of the brining and grilling with the wood made all the difference in the delicious smoked taste of this recipe! The chops were so tender and moist. We grilled a lot of onions for 2 reasons, I had an extra bag on hand, and we love grilled onions. We also made a slaw with the cabbage and the rest of the ingredients. I added some thin orange sections to my slaw to compliment the orange juice in the recipe (the lime juice over powered the fresh orange juice, but it wasn't in a bad way). I also made some red beans and rice as a side dish, and the corn tortillas brought it all together perfectly! I might just make this into soft pork tacos using the slaw as a topping next time. There are endless possibilities to this recipe that I look forward to mixing it up a bit in the near future, ie., pomegranate added to the slaw, scallions, fresh slivers of jalepeno and possibly queso blanco!

This got rave reviews at a recent gathering of friends. Used wood charcoal (and wood chips) but didn't have an appropriate pan to put in the middle of coals--didn't matter. Also went the "slaw" route that several others suggested.

I wavered between two and three stars...went with three b/c of the fresh taste and use of many ingredients i LUV (avocado, onion, pork). Skipped the radishes (the ones from the garden aren't doing so hot and the ones at the store looked BOO). Two suggestions - Go ahead and toss the avocado into the citrus marinade with the onion and don't drain before serving. The raw cabbage benefits from the citrus "dressing." And secondly, we plated the meal individually for ease. I think if a family style service is what you're after, it would help to slice the chops instead of placing them whole on your serving platter. We found the tortilla unnecessary and opted for a delish cornbread! Enjoy.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The pork was pork - just pork - boring - tender but boring. It should have been seared to at least get some crunch. the smoke flavor was minimal. It was a fair amount of work too, to be so ho hum. The only good thing in this recipe was the onions. Wonderful. I'll make them again to accompany another, better recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe! I think I should have rinsed the meat after taking it out of the brine so it would not have been as salty. So I just warned everyone who shared this with me not to use salt! But that is typical of any meat you brine...I just forgot to rinse it! The onions were really good and I didn't drain the juice. I haven't used smoke chips for a long time, not sure if it really added anything to the dish. This recipe is a keeper.

These pork chops were absolutely delicious. Very juicy and flavorful. We used Hickory wood to smoke - the recipe didn't specify a particular wood to use and that is what I had in the pantry. My husband thought they tasted like cured ham. I made the cabbage into a slaw, first by adding the grilled onions to the orange juice/lime juice mixture as stated in the directions. I let the grilled onions sit in the juice mixture for a little bit, seasoned with salt and pepper and then added the cabbage, avocado, cilantro and radishes and then tossed. It turned out to be a very tasty slaw.

Fantastic finger licking taste. Next time will use more onions because they were so yummy. Cabbage didn't add much to the meal - it was just a garnish. I would use the left over orange juice and lime juice as a dressing on the cabbage and make it more of a salad. Also, used grapefruit juice instead of orange juice since that is what I had.
