This salad was an interesting mix. Loved the pineapple and jicama but the cumin just didn't sell me on this salad. I usually love cumin but the combination of super sweet pineapple and cumin was odd. Texture was great and the dressing was tasty. I cut back on the oil a little and there was still lots of dressing sitting in the bottom of the bowl.

This was very nice and pleasant...I am not a fan of fruit in my salads but the pineapple was quite yummy!!!

Delicious. Added diced mango and swapped some of the white wine vinegar for sherry vinegar.

I thought this salad was delicious. It was crunchy and flavorful and a wonderful addition to a mexican theme dinner.

I found it to be delicious. The flavors stand up to all the robust latin dishes I have made. I will certainly make it again. You can interchange lots of things that you might prefe rover pineapple. if you like oranges use them or if you want a more contrast in color use straberries. Its all good!

Bland and oily. I was expecting something more refreshing. Big disappointment. I will not make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor, a refreshing salad!

Very refreshing dressing! I did not use the pineapple, as my husband doesn't really like pineapple chunks 'in things'. Instead, I added the juice from one small can of pineapple slices and about 1/2 tsp. or so of sugar. I tossed the jicama strips in this, then mounded them on a bed of spinach, skipping the additional cilantro, and drizzled more dressing over all. I really liked this, but my husband didn't comment, which means 'don't make this for me again, please!' **Update - Made it again and hubby said he really liked the jicama. So there.**

Nothing spectacular but tasty. I substituted with cider vinegar, red onion, a fruity olive oil and added pineapple juice to the dressing. Needs more color, may add orange sections, strawberry halves to salad if I make it again.

Great summer salad. Healthy and delicious. Great with the crab and tomato quesadilla's. Fresh pineapple is highly recommended.

I was disappointed with this recipe considering all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and it just seemed "ok"-I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't care for it. Just wasn't my cup of tea I guess.

This makes an extremely attractive salad. I had a hard time getting the dressing just right though. It wasn't quite tart enough, so I added a bit more vinegar, but even then it had trouble countering the sweetness of the pineapple. (I could only find a "gold" pineapple, which seems to be the only kind around these days and which are, in my opinion, too sweet by half.) Maybe it needed more salt, too.

This is truly an amazing recipe -- quick, easy and original. A great accompanying dish to any barbecue. We found that it's even better the next day after the flavors have had a chance to blend. I've made this several times - it's also good as a side for Mexican food.

Great recipe! I omitted the additional cilantro that was in the salad, using only the recommended amount in the dressing. I think it would probably be too much cilantro if you added as much as the recipe called for. I would definitely use this recipe again.

Try adding hearts of palm! This was a piquant and delicious summer salad.

We had to use mandarin oranges because we didn't have pineapple, but the dressing is excellent. We are thinking about using the dressing as a marinade for flank steak.

Very good. Interesting flavors, but not too strange. I'm making it again to take for Easter picnic!

I've made this at least a dozen times & it's always a winner. I haven't found a barbecue yet that this salad doesn't compliment. Try adding fresh mango to this salad. Gastrogasmic!

Special. My husband and I eat a lot of salad. I was looking for something a little different to serve guests with a latin menu...this one did the trick. The vinaigrette is terrific with the cumin. You do need to like cilantro however (we do) because this recipe has a lot...a terrific combination of flavors especially if you have the time to prep the fresh pineapple.Highly recommend. We served it with the Pozole Rojo also on this site and chocolate orange creme brulee (it's here too) and were pleased with all and so were our guests.

This is a great recipe that I make often,one thing that I do that works is I use a vegetable peeler and shave the jicima with it. It seem to blend better with the salad, and dont give it that "french fry" look

Needed a lot more spinach and pineapple. Too much cilantro! Couldn't eat it.

A friend made this for dinner club and it was spectacular! The cilantro and pineapple blend so weel with the jicama; the tastes just dance in your mouth. Make sure you pour on the dressing a little bit at a time and toss well, instead of dumping it all on at once. Too much dressing could ruin this tasty salad.

Took it to a Mexican Pot Luck Dinner and everyone raved and wanted the recipe. It really complemented the "hot" food. Thanks

I add a little extra cumin and 1 t. sugar to the dressing. Then I mixed the spinach and pineapple/jicama separately and arranged it all on a large platter with the spinach on the bottom and fruit piled on top with a few chopped green onions for garnish. It was quite a good looking salad and a fine compliment to our other Mexican dishes.

This salad was perfect with creamy enchiladas and a spicy bean dish. The delicate cilantro and jicama flavours did not overpower the subtle cheese flavours, which was perfect. Very refreshing on a hot day.

I was lucky to find the best baby spinach, jicama and cilantro for starters--that's basic. The salad looks lovely and if you're having a spicy Mexican dinner (as we were) it is refreshing in taste and texture. My only change would be to cut back white vinegar by 1/3, and add a pinch of sugar. I used Colavita white wine vinegar, and it was very tart. Everyone at the party seemed to like it.
