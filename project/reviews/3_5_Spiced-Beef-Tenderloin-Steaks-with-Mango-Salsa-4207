Outstanding! Love the combination of flavors, the freshness and the visual appeal. On the off chance there are leftovers, serve the thinly sliced steak and salsa over arugula the next day. Can't get enough! If you're feeding a crowd, flank steak works just as well.

oops... we got the Beef, but where's the Mango?

I've made this for years and always pull out the recipe when I want to impress, but don't have a lot of time. I never would have thought to make a rub with cinnamon, but the combination of spices and the salsa is a winner.

I've made this several times and it is always a HUGE hit. I made it for a party of 12 and the guests were fighting over the last piece of beef. Delicious. Make sure you get a nice cut of beef. It is tender and the spices with the mango offer a flavorful dining experience. It is a repeat.

The mango salsa was great, but that's where it ends. There was not nearly enough salt... and cinnamon on tenderloin? The only spices that should be used on a tenderloin are salt and pepper. Make the mango salsa and use it with something else but skip this recipe for the tenderloin.

This is great! I have made it time and time again using tenderloin and New York strip steaks. The salsa is also great with chips!

Made this on a weeknight and it was so delicious and SO easy. I used filet tail, as my butcher said that it is even more flavorful than filet steaks, and I think he was right. I also did not have all the ingredients for the mango salsa in the recipe, so I made Mango Salsa Wilfert with it, which worked out just fine. I think just about any mango salsa would do--the spiciness of the meat is so complemented by the sweetness of the mango.

I have been making this recipe for years - since it was first published in the magazine. It is a great summertime dish. The salsa can be made ahead and just grill the filets when you're ready!

I must thank Laura Bart for giving me the courage to try this recipe! This is one of those recipes that may sound too "different" when you read it, but when you taste it you will be pleasantly surprised at how well all the flavors complement each other. If fresh mangos are not available, you might want to try the diced mangos in clear jars sometimes found in the produce section. A real winner!

This recipe is wonderful!!!!! I made all three, the meat, the salsa, and the garlic potatoes and there were no complaints and no leftovers. The only change I made was to leave out the jalapeno as the jelly I got was spicy enough on it's own. A definite winner!!!!!

Fantastic! I doubled this recipe "just in case" and sure enough, I needed it. The salsa is perfect with the spices on the tenderloin - don't be afraid! As there were NO leftovers of the tenderloin, we used the leftover salsa on some hamburger the next day - yummy! I'll defintiely make this whenever I want to impress!

Where does "Mango" enter into this recipe? As I read it, it does not call for any "mango" to be used. I think there might be a mistake on the computer.

I have made this dish multiple times since I got it 1997 from the magazine. It is a winner with rave reviews from everyone. Don't skip the mango salsa, it really complements the filet.

First time I did it w/ black angus tenderloin, individual pieces on the grill...incredible. Second time I had a lower quality beef roast, which was alright, but not quite as good, although it made for wonderful fajitas the next couple of days. I agree with other reviewers' comments about how it smells like you're baking cookings when you put it on the grill...I followed recipe in terms of proportions for the spices, and found the cinnamon content to be just right. I highly recommend this recipe, and can't wait to try it with a pork tenderloin. Regards.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I make up large amounts of the rub and keep it in my spice cabinet to throw on many kinds of meat. It's even nice on catfish. The mango salsa has such a clean, sweeet flavor that perfectly compliments the spice of the rub. I highly recommend it.

A beautiful summer night for outdoor grilling, and this was our first, and DEFINITELY not last time preparing this recipe! We chose to grill the whole tenderloin, rather than individual steaks. The air surrounding the grill smelled sweet...almost as if we were baking cookies, but one bite, and we knew this was the perfect combination of sweet and spice! I don't think it would be too much to have the rub on the entire surface of an individual tenderloin...and we'll try that next time. We also did not try the salsa or potatoes. Another epicurious meal to look forward to, I guess! This is a keeper!

I was worried about putting a rub on such a good piece of meat...was I wrong! It was FANTASTIC!!! I got RAVE REVIEWS about how well the flavors mixed together! Be sure to make the salsa and potatoes! INCREDIBLE!!!

The rub alone or the salsa alone would be great, but in combination ... pandemonium! It's easy to put together, tho, and I will probably use each separately.

We've made this dish a lot and always love it. The meat rub is wonderful on pork tenderloin also, but with red yams or a squash instead of salsa. We always add extra spice and cilantro to the salsa for a kick. Consistently a great recipe.

This is fabulous! Easy and very tasty. I made Tiramisu for dessert and it was a nice combination.

I made it for my gourmet club. I used a whole tenderloin instead of steaks, but still grilled it. I served it with the salsa & potatoes - Everyone loved it! A real keeper!

I thought this was ok but my husband did not like the cinnamon taste. I didn't bother with the mango salsa. Perhaps my review would be different had I made the salsa. The flavors of the rub just didn't seem to come through much. I won't make this again.

To the cook from Kalamazoo, MI... dump the guy, keep the tenderloin! Beef Tenderloin, coupled with the fine recipes on this web site will never let you down!

These steaks ruined my weekend. I purchased the suggested tenderloin/filet mignon Saturday morning to prepare for my BF, his friend, and myself as a celebratory dinner--my BF landed a job interview that he really wanted, and I decided to do something nice. When BF found out I'd (gasp!) splurged on filet mignon, we got into a huge, completely un-steak-related argument about money management, who was more annoying, etc., which ended with me screaming "fine! Next time I'll buy CUBE STEAKS!", slamming down the phone, and going to bed crying with no dinner at all. Sunday night, I trucked the guilty steaks over to my best friend's house, spiced them exactly as directed, and had her BF grill them. They were some of the best steaks any of us have ever eaten. Warning: our coals were a leeeetle too hot, and although the steaks were thick, I think filet mignon is easy to overcook. It was my first time preparing them, next time, I will 1). Not invite my BF to eat them with me, and 2). carefully monitor their cooking time.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It has become a tradition to make it every year before the fireworks on the Fourth of July. The spices combined with the salsa are incredible!Have fun enjoying this dish often!

This is GREAT! I made it for my husband and his family and we all absolutley loved it. The flavor of the rub was delicious; the blend of spices is perfect. The mango salsa was also good and went well with the beef (incidentally, I used top sirloin and it was fine). It took me a while to prepare it all but it was more than worth it; I will make this again and again!

We were hesitant about the cinnamon, but the rub turned out to have a very interesting blend of flavours. Next time we might use just a touch less cinnamon, but definately wouldn't think of ommiting it! We let the meat sit with the spices rubbed in for about 20 minutes before cooking, and had to cook it on an indoor electric grill because of the weather. Wonderful with the mango salsa and chipotle garlic mashed potatoes!

Fun, flavorful recipe! I have made this recipe as stated, but have also used it with pork tenderloins. Both were well liked, with the pork/salsa perhaps given the slight edge for our preference. The rub is a keeper...
