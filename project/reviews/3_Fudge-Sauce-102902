It's easy but not worth it. Chocolate sundae sauce worked even better for me, than this sauce.

Agree, easy, but not worth it. Pre-made sundae chocolate sauce worked just as well.

I have used this fudge sauce for several years now after seeing it used on a tv program on the Food network. The reason for the corn syrup is that sugar will seperate and make the sauce gritty and not smooth. It IS worth the time and effort to make and it can be stored easily and reheated.

I make this cake every year. It is not difficult, just takes time to construct. Makes an impressive presentation.

To A Cook on 12/19/05 - almost 3 years later... I would think the purpose of the corn syrup, since it's a hygroscopic sugar, is to give the hot fudge it's "fudgieness". Without it, you'd have ganache (cream + chocolate)...which is chocolately, but not fudgy.

This was easy and delicious! I made it to go in a pie recipe and it was so good, I'll probably use it to top ice cream another time.

Can anyone tell me why the corn syrup is in this recipe?

I love this recipe and everyone I've made it for has raved about it and loved it! Easy and I make it to top ice cream all the time!

Easy, yes, but not even worth a modest investment in time and ingredients.
