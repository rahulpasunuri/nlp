just a note on cooking quail: i have the best luck when i broil them on a rack (set low in the oven so the marinade doesn't turn black if there's a sugar in it). it takes, very roughly, 10 minutes or so, but I use my thermometer to judge (165-170 degrees). they brown and crisp nicely. also, the legs sometimes splay in a shameful manner, so i loosely tie them closer together with some twine.

This is a delicious recipe, but I agree with the other reviewers that the cooking time is too long. I gave them 10 min. at 450, basted them again, and then another 15 min., basting again halfway through. Instead of the apple and cranberry juice, I used ¼ cup of pomegranate molasses plus enough orange juice to make 1 cup.

40 minutes for quail? Are they mutant quail the size of chickens? That's more than enough time for a cornish hen, which averages about 4 times the size of a bitty quail. I'd go 20 minutes MAX.

AWWWWWESOME dish, my husband said it is one of the best dinners I've made, I agree, I made some substitutions, I used cornish hens instead and the store didn't have cranberrys so I used frozen rasberrys--it was delish!!! I made it for just us two so when I make it for company, which I definately will, I will double the sauce. I made a nice rice medaly on the side. This is a wonderfull recipe!!!

The cooking time is MUCH too long. I cut in half even for very large quail. Try using half chicken (even better quail stock) and half veal stock for a richer stock. Try deglazing the pan with Madeira. I have made the recipe 3 times. Will make it 20 over the holidays. Served it with acorn squash stuffed with chestnut pruee and wild rice. This would be a 4-forker except for the cooking time issue.

Yummmmm!!!! The sauce is heavenly, I saved a good amount for the side! Only thing is, make sure you add a little sugar, otherwise it will be a bit too sour. The sauce was also a good topping for cheesecake.
