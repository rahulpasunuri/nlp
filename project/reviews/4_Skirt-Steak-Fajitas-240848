This was delicious! I added a teaspoon of chili powder and a half teaspoon of paprika to the marinade to kick it up a little, and I left out the cilantro. Will absolutely make it again!

Love this marinade, it's perfect. I like to use NY or Sirloin for fajitas, more flavor and less chewy than flank or skirt steak. I use this recipe for overnight river trips and it's always a crowd pleaser!!

Very good. My only suggestion is to pat the steak dry with paper towels before grilling otherwise they don't char or brown very well. I think I left the steak in the marinade too long the 2nd time I made them and they were a little limey. I wouldn't go past about 8 hours. Otherwise these are very good. Lot's of compliments.

For vegetarian: Recommend 1 more teaspoon of cumin and jalapeno each for more flavor. I replaced meat with 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, 1/2 small onion, 2 stalks green onion, 1 julienne carrot and 1/2 julienne yellow squash. I put half the cilantro in with the vegetables for cooking. Cooked vegetables in fry pain using water by covering pan with top. Once everything was closed to done I added the lime juice and remaining cilantro. Great reviews from family. Can be served over falafel or brown rice.

Simple, delicious, & will use again. However, I'm not sure why you would add cilantro to the marinade as it doesn't impart much flavor. I would hold it out and use both chopped and a few whole cilantro leaves when assembling the fajitas. (That also gives the advantage of being able to leave it out for those who don't like cilantro). Also, I used flank steak instead of skirt steak and it worked perfectly.

This is a simple and tasty marinade for skirt steak. My one modification was to leave out the cilantro as my husband does not care for its flavor.

Easy and delicious. I cooked the steak on a cast iron grill pan, about 3 minutes on each side and it came out about medium rare to rare. The meat was very tender and juicy. Served with caramelized onions and red peppers, guacamole, and the black bean and hominy salsa recipe from this site. This one's going in the rotation.
