Oh Mon Dieu - I just made this for a Valentine's Evening dinner for my honey and myself, and we both agreed this was fine dining quality - and such beautiful presentation. I served over the potato-apple mash and with green beans on the side. I also cooked the lamb for about 14 minutes instead of 20, as my oven is hot and I found browning it in the first step cooked sufficiently. We like it rare. :) Excellent!!

Delicious! Made as a lamb roast. Used panko breadcrumbs, forgot the thyme, and made my own side dishes... and it was STILL great! I made one serving of the port-red wine sauce and it took at least 45 minutes to reduce to 1/3 cup, but it was well worth it. The temp of 130 for med-rare was spot on. This one is definitely a keeper!

Not rating the whole recipe. I only made the sauce, but I did so with a few adjustments. I added a large sprig of rosemary and 2 cloves of garlic which I took out after the sauce had reduced enough. Also added 2 healthy tbl. spoons of currant jelly once the sauce had come to a boil. After the sauce had reduced enough I still wanted a different kind of depth so I whisked in a good quality,store bought demi-glace. Finally, I only used about 3-4 tbl.spoons of butter. Served with medallions of lamb. Was delicious.

Best lamb I ever made as well. My husband keeps raving about it. I did add some garlic to the encrustment, though...just one small clove.

Made for Christmas Eve dinner. The best rack of lamb I have ever made.

absolutely fantastic!! did it for valentines day and cut the recipe for only one rack of lamb. We used artichokes as a side dish with a simple dipping vinaigrette. The combination was delightful and the port-wine sauce simply delicious.

Made this for Christmas dinner this year and it was wonderful! I used a half leg of lamb instead of a rack since there was only two of us. For a perfect accompaniment, try the "horseradish mashed potatoes" from this site.

Outstanding. I have served this a couple of times now to rave reviews. I too went with the garlic mash the second time around and preffered it over the yams.

This was very good, but I won't make it again because there are so many recipes, so little time.

First. The recipe is great. Some reviewers critiqued the wine sauce for coming apart in the gravy boat. The solution is to add a good two pinches of flour and whisk those in with the butter. This allows for an emulsion (an even mixture of wine particles seperated by butter particles, if you want to think of it that way). My only complaint is that the wonderfully smelling herbed breadcrumb mixture did not really form a good crust in spite of using a good amount of dijon. The end result was a slighly patchy breadcrumbed roast but still taste was excellent. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes instead of their recommendation.

A fabulous dish, the port sauce is great as long as you simmer until thickened which took me a long time. Also, I served mine on top of the apples and yams recommended with this dish, with the wine sause on top of both - simply to die for.

Served this dish for Christmas dinner 2001 and it was a major hit. The in-laws loved the sauce, plus the contrast between the red meat and sauce and the green crust was perfect for the holiday!

Served for X-mas eve. Forget the fancy bread, I used squaw bread from Costco, this was an absolute slam dunk. Raves from kids to grandparents. I used a homemade german-style mustard, a little sweeter than dijon. Start early on the sauce reduction if you double the receipe. Suggest making a couple of spare racks for left overs. reheat in micro @ 2 min on simmer. If posible searing best done outside on grill. Our house smells like lamb central(which is ok)

The meat was great but the Port-Wine Sauce was terrible and a huge disappointment. It tasted like hot wine. I can't understand how people rave about it. There must be some ingredients missing. I made a similar sauce from a Prime Rib with Cabernet Jus that also included beef broth, shallots, garlic and spices (in addition to the wine & port). The Cabernet Sauce was delicous.

This is a great and easy recipe. I made it with pork instead of lamb, which changed the cooking time. Everyone loved it. I will try it with lamb next. The port wine sauce is fabulous, I can see it tasting great with beef too. Double the sauce.

very easy and extremely elegant. In the sauce, I used a roux instead of plain butter, sauce came out thicker and wonderful

The ingredients don't look like much on the surface but I must say, I agree with the other reviewers. This was very easy to prepare and was great with garlic mashers and steamed green beans. The substitutions we needed to make were: crustless baguette vs brioche, dried vs fresh herbs, ruby vs tawny port. Still great!

The sauce is great.Didn't have lamb but did it with a pork roast.Delicious.Also I just mashed the yams and apples-liked the little chunks of apples you get that way.

I made this dish for a dinner party and the guests not only loved the flavors bu tthe presentation. Fairly easy to prepare and even make certain parts slightly ahead of time so you can enjoy some of your meal with the guests at the table!!

I made this yesterday for my husband and my sister. And we all loved it. It was definately a decadent meal!! I agree that the sauce is what makes it. I think it would go really good with a nice filet mignon too. I doubled the sauce. I also wasn't sure on the amount of bread crumbs, but I think next time I will use less crumbs-- The mustard, herbs and sauce are indispensable!!! I also want to try it with garlic mashed potatoes, but the yams were just the right accompanimient too.

I made this for Christmas Eve 2000 in a rented condo, so here were my adjustments necessitated ingredients & personal taste. Availability: Used English muffin for bread crumbs, omitted thyme, omitted port; Taste: omitted mustard. Results. Wonderfully delicious. Made mushroom sauce with sauce for those who loved mushrooms. I got raves from my mother-in-law and aunt-in-law. Served with frozen peas and twice baked potatoes. Next time I'll use the port & maybe the thyme if the market isn't out.

Yes, its true, really great way to prepare rack of lamb. Also, a really good looking dish. I didn't like the yams too much. I had done it the time before with garlic mash potatoes and like that combination much better.

The sauce is the real reason I come back to the recipe. While it is excellent with this classic lamb dish I also use it with frenched pork loin roast.

Wonderful entree! The amount of breadcrumbs was a little confusing (is it two cups packed before or after they are put in the processor). Use your judgement; it depends on how strong you would like the herb flavor. We tripled the sauce (based on a suggestion to double the sauce). It was very popular decision. The onion rings were very good, but a lot of work. We would make them again if we wanted onion rings for a meal, but they were not necessary for this meal.

Gathered with friends for a special meal a week after Y2K hype died down. Made this dish, garlic mashed potatoes, green beans almondine. Started with a great salad with strawberries, avocado, and fresh water chestnuts, & pecans to start; finished with lemon mousse. Fantastic!

The recipe was an absolute success at my New Year's Eve party. Everyone raved about the sauce. My advice is to double the sauce recipe and add some of the lamb juices just before serving.

This dish made an ABSOLUTELY delicious way to ring in the new year!! Take the time to make the fresh bread crumbs- it's soooo worth it! I served the lamb with garlic mashed potatoes and lots of fresh, steamed veggies. The sauce is very tasty and makes a wonderful presentation when plated. Make this one and listen to the compliments! ENJOY!

I cooked this dish for Christmas Eve dinner and served it with fresh asparagus. It was very festive with the red and green. I had always thought that cooking lamb would be difficult. I found it very simple. My brother loves lamb and this was by far his favorite home cooked meal.

I used another recipe for the lamb but followed this for the port red wine sauce, which was fabulous. One thing about it, though: the butter and the red wine / port separated while at the table (in the gravy boat), which was rather unappetizing. Next time I do it, I am going to try it with less butter, and I'm going to add the butter at the beginning as is suggested in the Beef Tenderloin with Port-Rosemary Sauce recipe: http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=268

This recipe is two thumbs up! I served it with the "Trio of Roasted Potatoes. I sliced the rack into two chops each, then browned them. I didn't use the brioche, instead I used unseasoned stuffing mix I had on hand. After adding fresh rosemary, parsely, and thyme- I thought it was delicious. I needed to reduce the port sauce more... and that was my fault for not cooking at a hard boil.

I made this for a dinner party for six. One of the guests was a local caterer. It turned out so well, she asked for the recipe and now uses it as part of her catering repitoire.

The port wine sauce is decadent and goes wonderfully with the lamb. I substitute a little fresh ground sage instead of parsley for real country flavor. Removing every second bone to make big chops and arranging them over a mound of rough mashed white and sweet potatoes before drizzling with the sauce makes a great display on the plate. Ask your butcher for Australian lamb for a sweeter, more tender taste. You should find it in the USA for under $10/lb. To complete the Aussie theme, wash it all down with a full bodied red shiraz like Henschke "Hill of Grace" which is truly stunning (best years 82, 84, 86, 88).

recommend pureed parnsip with this, complements the sauce.

EXCELLENT! Especially with the suggested side dishes. In fact, the port red wine sauce drizzled over the mashed apples and yams was the best part! The orange of the mash and the burgandy of the sauce made a lovely plate. A real crowd-pleaser...

I have adapted this to lamb chops in the toaster-oven, and on week nights I use ordinary packaged breadcrumbs -- it's scrumptious, every time. A bit fussy for a large dinner party (I tried that once) but excellent romantic-dinner-for-two material. You can thicken the sauce a bit with beurre manier instead of just butter at the end.
