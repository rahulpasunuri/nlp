Don't let the apparent simplicity of this recipe fool you into thinking it's bland. These are DELICIOUS! I couldn't make them fast enough for my guests. People hovered over the stove waiting for them. If you are lucky enough to have a good Japanese grocery store nearby, look for Yuzu salt, and serve alongside.
