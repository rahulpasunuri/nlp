Haven't made yet so not rating. To those worried about "too much honey taste"- Tupelo Honey has a very strong (wonderful) flavor. This is likely the cause. My mother made this as written with wild flower honey to great response.

I followed the recipe and thought it was amazing! Though I could taste the honey, I didn't find it overpowering. I also made tartlets with purchased pie crust on a separate occasion, and had equally delicious results.

I forgot to mention that I used half honey and half corn syrup in response to reviews that said the honey taste was too strong. The taste was not too strong in my version but I wonder if the corn syrup contributed to the sweetness. Not sure about sugar content of syrup vs. honey.

This was nearly perfect. The only flaw was that it was too sweet for my taste, even cutting down on the sugar in the peanut butter frosting to 3/4 cup. Otherwise, yum. My kids LOVED it. I'd put a baking sheet or foil under the crust as you prebake to avoid butter dripping and burning. I baked it 20 mins with pie weights and 10 without. It sort of worked, the crust still bubbled up a little under the caramel, don't know if that was because of how I cooked it or not. Next time I'd cut down further on the sugar in the peanut butter frosting and maybe reduce the caramel too. This is so close to amazing.

I made this exactly according to the directions for my Chocolate-Peanut Butter-aholic husband's birthday. The instructions look long, but there isn't too much hands-on time. It received good reviews, although some people thought the honey taste was a little strong (I used a Tupelo honey). The only other note is that there could be more of the peanut-butter-powdered sugar layer. I would think about increasing that frosting-type layer when coating the crunchy peanut layer next time.

This dessert is very rich, but delicious. I used a store bought pie crust and saved alot of time. This recipe would be great made as "brownies" with a graham cracker crust as the bottom layer and then the fillings...

I made this dessert for Christmas Eve dinner and it is sensational. I forgot the step of brushing the egg white and baking it again, and it didn't make much difference (at least, it was still good). My son said it tasted like a Snickers, which I think it said in the intro to the recipe. It has a pretty strong honey taste. The layers make it impressive looking. I didn't have a tart pan so I made it in a springform pan and it was great.
