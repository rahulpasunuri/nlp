What temperature do I heat the oven to when I put the covered pot in the oven for 30 min? Thanks

The onion/date filling added delicious flavor to this healthy dish. I also love the way the pita got crispy. WARNING! This did not come out of the pot cleanly and I had to scrape most of the pita from the bottom of the pot, but it was totally worth it!

I made the spicy version of this dish and added garlic and and carrots in step 3. I also exchanged the hot chile for red pepper. At the very end of step 3 I also added two chopped tomatoes. It had a very interesting blend of flavors and was easy (if not quick) to make.

I had some problems with this recipe because I think some of the steps & ingredients were left off. Since the recipe did not state how much water to use when cooking the rice and lentils, I filled my medium sauce pan half way and added my brown rice and lentils. In future, I will probably use the amount of water on the package for rice and add about an extra cup so there is enough liquid for the lentils. I ended up with a lot more water than necessary, but I strained them and it was fine. Because of all the water, I did not add the 1/3 c of water the recipe stated in the final cooking stage. Also, you need to removed the onions and fruit from the pot before adding the pita & remaining butter. I also added garlic. All in all, I found the recipe to be tasty and satisfying. I will make this recipe again with some adjustments.
