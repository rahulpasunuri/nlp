Fabulous. Even the kids liked it.

Another note - the 1/2 cup oil used to sauté the onions, pancetta and tomatoes is WAY too much. I made this recipe again tonight, and made it just as written. The sauce was much, much too oily. Last time I just sautéed the pancetta and onions in a couple of tablespoons oil and it turned out much better. I think it might even be a mistake in the recipe. I can't imagine how 1/2 cup oil could be to anyone's taste.

loved it. panceta needs to be cut small, though. I didn't really cut it small enough.

Love, love, love this recipe! We skip the handmade pasta and substitute good quality penne. So delicious! One day I will try making the pasta, as for now it's a great weeknight meal.

My daughter and I had a great time making this pasta. It was easy, she had it plain with cheese, and I made the sauce for the rest of us...very good. I did add some tomato sauce as I had grape tomatoes and they weren't as juicy as they probably should be with cherry tomatoes. I will make this again.

Pasta was tender and delicious - sauce got rave reviews. Very time-consuming to make pasta - will invest in a machine to roll out pasta.

Made this for family visiting from Paris & they LOVED it. Asked for the recipe to make when they returned home. I made with good store bought pasta.

I decided to try this recipe because I thought it looked tasty and simple. Ive had freshly made pasta before and it really makes a difference in a dish. However, I found the directions in this recipe about how to shape the pasta very confusing! I rolled out the dough into ropes, but it just didnt make sense to me from there. I think youre actually supposed to cut them into one inch pieces, put your fingers or thumbs in the middle of the piece and push it apart creating somewhat of a boat shape. However, when I made the pasta it was too thick. Anyhow, the sauce is so tasty (how can you go wrong with lots of cheese, basil and tomatoes?) and the actual pasta dough has great flavor too. Id definitely try it again, but roll out the dough and put through a pasta machine or roll it out flat and cut it into strips and cook it like a rag pasta. All of that being said, I though the flavors were rich and worth the effort. Just get creative with the pasta making!

Very simple and delicious. I did not make the homemade pasta but made the sauce. This is delicious, fresh and easy. Substituted fresh rosemary for the oregano (my preference) and used fresh basil per recipe. I also added a little pasta water and a dash of heavy cream to the sauce at the end. Awesome.

I made this dish one night w/ fresh herbs and tomatoes from my garden. My boyfriend loved it so much he asked me to teach him how to make it a week or 2 later. We even froze the pasta and made it a different night. Also used more herbs than what recipe asked for.
