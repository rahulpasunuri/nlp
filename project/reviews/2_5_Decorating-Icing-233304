This is way too complicated and not very good. Just mix lemon juice and powdered sugar and your done.

This is great icing! We used it on sugar cookies, and we were very impressed with how easy it was to make and how delicious it was. Sam is very impressed with how it hardens after awhile, which makes the decorated cookies easy to transport.

These were a HUGE hit with the college kids and teenagers. They traveled well in college "care packages." I iced mine with a royal icing recipe using a color flow technique. Yummy!

I made this icing to go with the sugar cookies and it came out great. I spread in all over the cookie in a thin layer which seems to be the perfect amount so the cookie isn't too sweet. The icing dried hard enough to doodle on with food coloring markers. Fun and tasty.
