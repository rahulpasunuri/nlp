I've made this dish hundreds of times, but always using potato starch instead of cornstarch (cornstarch isn't common in Scandinavia). Using potato starch (you can usually find it in the Kosher section) gives it the right texture. In Finland we often add a few fresh strawberries for color and to soften the rhubarb's bite. If you do, add lemon juice so it doesn't get too sweet. It's most often served with milk, with cream as a treat.

I found this recipe to be really hard, and I'm not sure what went wrong, but it came out more like a gooey pie filling than a pudding. I followed the advice to add granny smith apples, and the overall taste was great, but the texture was all wrong. I didn't have time to let it chill enough, so that might have been part of the problem, but still it looked really sloppy. Any suggestions?

I found this to be quite easy, but I don't think I will make it again. I liked it, but nobody else did. You have to realllly like rhubarb to enjoy this. Maybe it would have been better with another fruit added in (such as apples, strawberries, or blue berries).

A scrumptious dessert which looks very elegant when served in individual parfait glasses. For the rhubarb mixture, I halved the amount of water as it was too runny, even with the cornflour thickening, and added diced granny smith apples halfway through the stewing for textural contrast. Also, I used an oatmeal crunch topping (from the Bailey's Pudding Parfait with Oatmeal Crunch recipe, Bon Appetit, March '99) which lifted it from delicious to sublime, and impressed my guests to no end. It's going to be one of my favourite dinner-party desserts from now on.

My grandmother used to make a similiar recipe and this brought back wonderful memories of summers spent out in the country with her. Many times she would let me pull a stalk of rhubarb from her garden and we would share it with sugar sprinkled on it.
