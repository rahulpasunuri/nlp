Made this tonight, grilling on the bar-b-que instead of baking, and we enjoyed it very much. Added the tbsp of hoisin as suggested by another reviewer and also a dollop of chili/garlic sauce.

this is a GREAT recipe!! I agree with the hoisin addition. It's a nice change from tomato based BBQ sauces for ribs. We'll enjoy it all summer!

This is a great recipe that is tasty--and easy! I had about 4 pounds of ribs, so just cooked them about 20 minutes longer. Didn't need to broil. Another plus for this recipe: Ingredients for the marinade are ones you have on hand. A keeper!

I added the hoisin sauce, as per Frank's suggestion, and marinaded it overnight. It turned out great. This was a very tasty marinade for ribs and I would make it again.
