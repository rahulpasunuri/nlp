This was SOOOOOOO Good! The lamb was so tender, the eggplant was so delicate, and actually silky, and it was truly a delight. We were all in ecstasy.

I searched for this recipe after having an absolutely wonderful meal of lamb with eggplant mousse in Crete. I was pretty sure eggplant would become my new favorite vegetable after that dinner! I noticed only a few seeds and only some very slight eggplant texture in my restaurant meal, but for the most part it had a velvety mashed potato-like consistency that went amazingly well with the lamb. However, when I started to follow this recipe it seemed like there was no way to get rid of the copious seeds, it was going to be chunky, and one eggplant wasn't going to make the puree eggplant-y enough. I ended up using 2 large eggplants (although I'll probably shoot for 3 next time) and broiled them under my gas range for 30 minutes rather than 15 to make them extra squashy. I also salted the eggplant before setting in the colander & squeezed juice out with a cheesecloth before pureeing. I experimented with the finest disc on my food mill which was okay (still a few seeds though and some fiber left behind), but got the results closest to what I was looking for using my slow juicer and running the waste pulp through 2 or 3 times to get all the eggplant out. The only waste was seeds - no eggplant - and yielded about 2 cups of super smooth seedless puree. If you want some texture you could mash up the seed-free bits of eggplant with a fork as recommended but it seemed like a lot of picking through to get rid of the seed-y bits. What I got was super-delicious velvety eggplant "mashed potatoes" which was the perfect accompaniment to the lamb. The lamb part of the meal was great - I used about 6 Roma tomatoes from the garden vs the one they called for and chopped the lamb cubes a little smaller to replicate the restaurant meal.

Definitely a keeper! Like some others, I cheated and used lean ground lamb, and it was fine and fast. I grilled the eggplant a day early, after using the grill for that night's dinner, and pureed it in the food processor before stirring the sauce ingredients together. Family raved!

As a previous reviewer said, this is a very subtle dish, so if you need strong flavors to taste anything, make something else. It was a bit too subtle for me, especially given the time it took to make and the calories from all the butter, milk, and cheese. Furthermore, my husband and kids, who don't like eggplant, did not like this (maybe not surprising, but some previous reviews had said even eggplant haters loved it). I won't make again, and will probably throw out the remainder since no one else likes it and I don't need the extra calories.

Happy to see the recipe on this website - I've been making it for years and heard nothing but happy moaning from my guests. One thing I do differently is - Gruyere cheese. If you use a grinder/blender to mash the eggplant (in stead of the fork), the seeds wouldn't matter much and you wouldn't need to soak it in lemon.

This is to die for. You can even cheat and use ground lamb and a 16 oz can of organic tomatoes if pressed for time. What makes this dish is the lovely sauce. To get rid of the bitterness, mash the eggplant in a collander to release some of the seeds and bitter juices, Squeeze it dry, then puree in a blender, adding the sauce and blending until creamy. Return to the pan and stir in the cheese, heating until it is melted. You can even use white sharp cheddar if you don't have kasseri, but kasseri has a more authentic flavor. This is meant to be a subtle, delicate dish, so if you need strong flavors to taste anything, make something else.

The lamb was outstanding, especially adding cumin as suggested, however, the eggplant was awful. I used kasseri cheese and made a wonderful roux but the seeds from the eggplant was just too much and ruined the dish. I threw away the mashed eggplant and served it over whole wheat noodles. Good save said the husband.

OK, I am cheating because I have not yet made this dish, and the forks are a nod to epicurious for making it easy to find the recipe. I just had this 2 weeks ago at the Sip Sak in NYC and I think I moaned aloud with every bite. Cannot wait to try it. If you plan to serve this to diners who profess not to like lamb or eggplant, do not tell them what it is. They will never guess and most likely want the recipe.

I had this dish in a Turkish restaurant and was very happy to have found a recipe. I didn't braise the lamb but only stewed it with more tomatoes and added some spice. Eggplant puree is impeccable.

I used boneless chicken thighs, instead of lamb. I also did not peel the tomato. The sauce was fine like that. I added a minced clove of garlic and 1 T of cumin to the tomato sauce. So sue me... I couldn't believe it would fly with no spice. As for the eggplant puree, it was great. Yummy. I used soy milk and omitted the cheese, too. So... I really liked the eggplant here. Great way to use this vegetable. This was tasty.

I made the eggplant puree earlier in the day, then started the lamb later so there wasn't so much to do all at once. Midway through the recipe I had second thoughts and wondered if it could be any good without more seasonings. It was! My husband didn't ask what is this (?), just said it was really good!

The lamb comes out wonderfully light and flavoursome. You can reduce the cooking time by half an hour and leave the lid slightly ajar to concentrate the flavour whilst not reducing tenderness. Tip: cut the lamb slightly larger than suggested as it reduces during cooking. Also I ended up throwing away half the sauce before adding twice the aubergine, mainly to avoid the unnecessary calories and dilution of aubergine's flavour (otherwise it's like lamb on a poor man's houmous).

This dish is quite time consuming to make, but if you get the lamb just right and the eggplant nice and smokey, this dish really is a crowd pleaser. Especially good because my wife doesn't like eggplant and the eggplant puree nicely gives the eggplant smokey flavor without the purple...

This dish takes a long time- especially if you have to cube the meat yourself. However, my roommate devoured it and said it was delicious. I'd recommend using a little extra tomato if you don't want an overpowering lamb taste.

I recently had this dish at a Turkish restaurant and was delighted to find this recipe. I used 2 large eggplant, as much of it cooks down when grilling. I used 1 tsp of flour, less milk and a Balkan farmer's cheese. The dish got wonderful reviews!

This is a wonderful example of elegant simplicity. Follow the directions and have a wonderful meal. Note: I recommend leaving the pot lid ajar for the last hour, so that the flavours can concentrate, and the juices reduce a bit. Serve with pita to mop up the sauce.
