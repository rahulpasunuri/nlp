I loved this sandwich. I made it for my family the day after Christmas. Delicious! Even my father, who never comments on food, was the first to say how good it was. I also, as one reviewer commented, had trouble with the aioli coming together so I just started again and made the "easy aioli" recipe on the epicurious site. It was just as good. Everyone commented on how great the onion relish was. Will definitely make again, in fact, making them again tonight!

This was a great use of leftover turkey and a backyard avocado, though we made one significant change (in addition to the doctored mayo rather than scratch aioli) to make it a quick weeknight meal. Instead of the long cooking onion relish, or even caramelized onions, for 2 people, I marinated one sliced onion in 2T honey and 2T each of the vinegars. After about 15 minutes, my husband grilled them on low heat for about 20 minutes on the gas grill, so the flavor was great but the timing was better. No doubt the long cooking would be better - richer and sweeter - but this still was an awesome sandwich and dinner.

I've made this sandwich about 6 times since I found the recipe a year ago - and I would never think of deviating from the recipe. It's that good! The onion relish is to die for! I served the leftover relish with fried eggs the next day - they were delicious! The best turkey sandwich ever.

Very good! I just Used Caramelized onion. Added tomato. Chipotle aioli. Sorry, I changed this a lot, but it was a nice platform for a good sandwich..though time consuming.

I thought these were great. We used ciabatta rolls from Costco, and leftover roast turkey breast. I struggled a bit with the aioli: it would not come together in my little Cuisinart food processor, nor in my blender, however my immersion blender worked wonders (add an additional egg yolk and a splash of vinegar if you need to do so). You could probably substitute the aioli with 1/2 cup commercial mayo mixed with the garlic and Dijon). The onions make the recipe.

I followed this recipe to the letter (for once!) and it was absolutely fantastic. Terrific use of turkey leftover from Easter. I had brined the turkey and roasted it with an herb compound butter under the breast so it was really moist and flavorful. My husband made ciabatta rolls from scratch and we both were thoroughly delighted with the sandwiches. Today I'm having a turkey, aiolo and arugula sandwich on another ciabatta roll for lunch and I've saved this recipe to my box. Minimal effort for maximum enjoyment.

I had this sandwich at Wichcraft, and I have to say, it was TREMENDOUS! I tried making it with some of the review-tips to save time, but nothing could compare until I made it as the recipe said. This sandwich is definitely worth the time to make it right! The incredibly creamy but refreshing aioli takes the sandwich to the next level, and there is no substitution for the perfectly sweet onion relish. My only recommendation is to add melty gruyere cheese. The server at the restaurant suggested the addition, and it was absolutely incredible.

A tasty way to use turkey leftovers! I made a quick version of the onion relish by sauteeing the onions over medium high heat in a skillet until golden brown, adding the liquids, and then setting to medium low to reduce. It saved time and still tasted great.

Excellent recipe! I used white onions instead of yellow and mesquite smoked turkey, very thinly sliced.

Absolutely Fabulous!! I followed another users idea and mixed mayo and mustard together instead of making the aioli. Served this at a family gathering and it was a huge hit. I also used soft kaiser rolls and found 1/2 of a sandwich was plenty.

I agree with the reviewer who served this for Super Bowl Sunday - it received rave reviews! My husband and I enjoyed it again the next night even more! I did the same with store bought mayo and doctored it up with garlic and cayenne. For the onion relish I carmelized the onions rather than cooking them as the recipe said. During the cooking process I added balsamic vinegar and that was all! Tasted great!

Tremendous. Served at a Super Bowl party and received rave reviews from everyone. I don't like to use raw egg so I added minced garlic, dijon mustard and cayenne to jarred mayo for the aiolo; otherwise, followed recipe exactly as written. Didn't care for the flavor of the onion relish when I tasted it alone but as a relish on the sandwich, it added great flavor. Will make this over and over.

An amazing sandwich - I used organic chicken breasts instead of roast turkey. We had them for lunch and I only wish that I had leftovers for work tomorrow!!!

I did not follow the recipe exactly (made a mix of low fat mayo & dijon mustard rather than the aioli) but it was very good and my family enjoyed it. Great use of leftover roast turkey breast.

Great sandwich. We included yams, cut into thin rounds and baked until tender; also caramelized the onions with balsamic vinegar.

I skipped the part about heating in the oven; just warmed the bacon and used the onions at room temperature. What a great sandwich! And easy, despite the length of the instructions. Make it!

Made the dish both with the onion relish and then with caramelized onions: it's definitely better with just plain caramelized onions. Used plain mayo, and it's a fast, delicious sandwich.

If stores sold caramelized onions, then I would buy turkeys all year round just to make this recipe. Caramelized onions, no matter how you make them (and they are time-consuming), always make a dish taste good. That being said, for a sandwich this is just too much work. Delicious, and a fabulous way to use leftover turkey, but for me just a little time-consuming for a sandwich. I may have to start making caramelized onions in batches and freezing them...
