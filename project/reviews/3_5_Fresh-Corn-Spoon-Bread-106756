Ok, I normally hate when people review a recipe and talk about their changes/adjustments....but, here I go. First, I'm a Virginia girl, so I know spoonbread. I prefer mine piping hot with fresh, unsalted butter. NOTHING better. I made this recipe and because it's winter, I used canned corn. (YIKES.) I had to get a fix though, I needed spoon bread to serve with the rabbit stew I made. I used two cans of corn, drained well. One of the cans went in the spoonbread as whole kernels. With the other can, I used my immersion blender and made a puree. I added a splash of cream to the mix and 1/2 cup of yellow cornmeal. I made no other changes to this recipe. My husband salted his, I didn't. I think if you made this recipe as-is, it would be great, but I really love a deep corn taste so I added more corn than called for. It puffed up beautifully. I'll make this again and post a picture. It was delicious!!

So many problems... 1. add 2 T sugar 2. Double corn meal 3. Do not expect southern style spoonbread. 4.Corn all sank to the bottom, will puree next time. I coated my buttered dish with sugar and salt to help it "climb." A lovely dish but maybe it should be renamed....

Don't wait for summer to use fresh corn! Frozen kernels work just fine. This is an excellent,easy spoon bread. Very light and fluffy, rich without being too much. It's also gluten-free which is a huge bonus!

This fabulous dish is a great complement to many others. Bland? It's spoon bread. Pay no attention to the naysayers. It works. I've made it serveral times a year since 2002. By the way, if you still have the July 2002 issue, drag it out. There are so many good recipes in it, I consider it a classic.

I tried this last Sunday when we had my parents over for dinner- everyone raved about how good it was. I think the ingredient that really made it was the corn- fresh Olathe white sweetcorn from Colorado. The crispy, barely cooked and sugar sweet corn paired well with the fluffy spoonbread; the whole dish was gone in a matter of minutes.

Not that great. It wasn't bad but bland and boring. I have had better corn casserole type recipes.

I serve this every Thanksgiving and every Christmas -- a Southern family tradition -- and there are no leftovers. Original recipe is from Christiana Campbell's in Williamsburg to which I have added finely chopped green onion. Frozen corn is ok; works fine. And I use more cornmeal; 1 1/4 C to 4 C milk; that ratio. No sugar. Southern spoon bread is not supposed to be sweet; it's bland. For those who don't mind the once- or twice-a-year cholesterol load, lots of butter on warm spoon bread is heavenly.

Question for LaurainNYC: Were you able to find fresh corn in Autumn? I, too, would like to make this dish later in the year, but worry about the water content of frozen and/or canned, and the availability of fresh. If anyone can answer, that would be great! Thanks!

This is so wonderful! I made this dish along with Salmon for my husband and one of his friends, they both loved it. Most of the dish was gone, and the left-overs of this dish were good with a little cheese. This recipe will not work if you use anything but fresh corn, and watch the size of your eggs. If you get to much moisture this could become soggy. Plus the fresh corn adds a wonderful taste!!!

The recipe looked good and simple, but seemed a bit bland for me. So I used 1.5 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of ricotta, and also used about a tablespoon and a half of fresh chopped sage. I served it with pork chops and wanted a more seasonally autumn corn dish and it was AWESOME! My boyfriend actually opted to eat more spoonbread rather than go for another chop!!! I will definitely try the jalepenos and more mexican additions in the summer time. This recipe really is a great base recipe for all kinds of tasty add-ons.

I have eaten spoon bread all of my life. I would never ever serve it with maple syrup or anything sweet. It is traditional in my family to have it with roast beef and one might put some beef gravy on it, but all it ever needs is a bit of butter melting on top. Tonight I decided to break with tradition and give it a southwestern flavor. Instead of butter I used about a cup of grated cheese, I also dusted the souffle dish with freshly grated romano and had a roasted, peeled, fresh poblano on hand so it was diced and added to the mix. Green Chile Cheese Spoon Bread was the delicious result.

I see there are two schools of thought shaping up on what this recipe was lacking. It's a great base and I never thought to add any spicy, peppery ingredients. My immediate reaction after tasting was that it would be great with butter and honey or maple syrup served with BBQ ribs or pork or fried chicken.It was and served that way does work well f0r breakfast or brunch. I like the other school of thought also and may try that in the future. Just needs a little help.

very good - to the cook from Chi town the heat of the oven is crucial and to the cook from SF - polenta is corn meal.

My 'bread' turned into an eggy mess- it was more of a frittata then a souffle. Perhaps I should blame by oven that's never quite hot enough, but I think the recipe is flawed, it needs more corn meal or some flour to bind the mix together.

I liked this, didn?t love it, my family hated it! Interestingly enough my cats were the real fans, I had a ½ dish left over (besides what was served and ignored), all cats devoured it. Then again this is not a spot for cat-food reviews. I did like the fresh corn, and presentation was beautiful, but lacked the creaminess of spoon bread and was more of a soufflé. It just screams for more flavors, a pound of cheese? Who knows, I wont make it again. One other note, careful when that stuff bubbles up on the stove, it?s HOT.

I'm with Susanb's review... and my corn was also very sweet and fresh. I added more salt (Hawaiian 'Alaea sea salt, which has a different taste than table salt) and finely fresh ground black pepper. Served with grilled salmon burgers. A nice side for any summer meal.

I substituted polenta for the corn meal (using about 20% more polenta than what it called for in corn meal) and it was delicious! Not grainy at all--just simple well balanced souffle/polenta flavors. Next time I'll get creative with some chili flavoring in the egg whites or something.

Based on reading the reviews, I prepared this by adding one bunch of green onions sliced, 1/4 of a red bell pepper diced and one seeded and diced jalapeno pepper. Outstanding!

This recipe perfectly typifies the simple pleasures of summer. I used a very sweet white corn, which added a lovely sweetness to this dish. The consistency was light and luscious.

amiable spouse and i really liked this receipe - pretty simple and i really like the souffle style - it's very light. i used white cornmeal since that's what i had on hand - delicious the only thing i will change is next time i will add some jalapenos to jazz it up just a bit

We loved this recipe, my 7 year old nephew said it was the best thing he had ever tasted! (and that's saying something!) I added a chopped green onion and some finely diced red pepper, which looked really nice, and 1/2 a jalapeno pepper, otherwise it would have been too bland. I'm making this for a special brunch tomorrow!

Tel Aviv: It could be that your corn was "wetter" than you expected or your eggs may have been extra large. Did you use frozen corn? If you did, that would definitely explain it.

What a disaster! After 20 minutes in the oven, the top was beautiful and golden. Imagine my dismay when I cut into it, and found a disgusting pool of liquid. I followed the recipe to the letter - any idea why it went wrong?

Easy to make and satisfying -- I'd serve it with spicy foods, as it's very plain. Leftovers are good in the morning topped with cheese.

We quite liked this recipe. It was easy to make - OK, I cheated and used frozen corn. It went beautifully with the sausage and potato salad on the facing page of the July issue of Gourmet. One half the recipe fit perfectly in a 3-cup pyrex baking dish.

I found this recipe to be just the right texture...not too dry as many corn breads or spoon breads are. I have sent this recipe to friends via email.

Used 2 cups of fresh white corn, added three drops of Tabasco, and 1 T of minced onion. Easy to make, easy to bake, and was just "OK" for the family. Served with grilled mild Italian sausage and a green salad. The amount produced does not fit into a glass 9.5" pie dish. Next time I'll use a ceramic quiche dish or a Corning Wear casserole dish.

My mother used to make a version of this with no fresh corn and more cornmeal (she called it corn meal souffle). Rather than serve it as a savory part of the meal, we draped large piles of it with warm molasses and (yes more) butter with an equal amount of simple greens and tomoto salad on the side. I did the same with this recipe and couldn't have been more pleased. Without the molasses I can imagine why people are finding this a bit bland.

Our dinner guests loved this dish. I agree with the cook from LA about serving with highly seasoned foods - it went perfectly with grilled pork tenderloin with ginger & peach marinade. And good fresh corn is a must for both flavor and moistness. This would also be a great breakfast dish.

I found this recipe awfull. My 2 year old daughter hated it as well. I would not recommend it.

On the other reviewer's suggestion, I added more corn. I used 2 cups of corn and it was just right. If you thought this recipe was bland, then maybe your corn was not too great. This recipe is all about the corn. It is a great side to highly seasoned food. It might be too tame to serve with plain meat. If you are serving a simple grilled meat, then by all means spice up the spoon bread with some finely chopped chili pepper. Keep the pieces small so that they will not adversely affect the puff of the spoon bread. This dish is almost like a souffle, but much easier. The finished product was puffy and brown on top and soft and runny underneath (like a custard). I baked mine in a shallow 1.5 quart oval ceramic gratin dish. It was just right. Our party of six dinner guests loved it. Some had seconds, and we had a serving left over. So, it could easily serve 8 people if you have other dishes to offer. Enjoy!

Ok recipe. I would double the fresh corn and maybe add jalepenos for flavor.

So simple to make, very nice presentation and very well received, many took second helpings. I used three ears of yellow corn and forgetting the fact that there is no sugar in the recipe I was almost expecting the flavor to be sweet like a pudding but it wasn't at all which was actually very nice. It makes a good bread substitute. I will definately make this again.
