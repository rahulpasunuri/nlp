Chili has always been an American dish! You can not find chili in any style made in the States in Mexico! But I have to agree in that there are better versions than this one.

Made this and imho, my recipe is better. I challange anyone to make both and tell me I am wrong. Sorry Pableaux. Chili is now an American dish.
