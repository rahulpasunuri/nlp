There was nothing wrong with this dish...it just was not yummy enough. It smelled delicious though:)

I made these with all sweet potatoes, and found no problem with excess liquid. However, the first batch fell apart in the oil. I added an extra egg and the rest of the batches held together fine. The taste is simple and delicious, a nice balance between savory and sweet.

A hit at brunch. I prepared them the night before and kept chilled. Maybe that helped the flavors? Hard to flip, so be careful.

I think the first reviewer was right about squeezing out the liquid from the potatoes. I unfortuntaely didn't do so, and the pancakes were soggier than they should have been. Other than that they were subtly flavoured but i rather liked them, although i think i would look for a better recipe next time,

I used only sweet potatoes for this, no russet. I did need to add a bit more flour to the mixture, but they held together fine after that. I'm not a huge fan of frying in this much oil, but my housemates snatched them up fast!

Made these at Xmas '03 for my girlfriend's family (along with a batch of zucchini pancakes), and everyone loved them.. Have a nice look to them as well. Making them shortly for MY family in fact for Jewish New Year!

The whole mixture was too chunky and wouldn't hold together on the grill. I added a bit more flour (1/4 cup more) and 1/4 cup milk and put it all through the food processor. After the adjustments the pancakes fried up nicely and were loved by all, even my two year old.

One important thing missing is to squeeze out the water from the potatoes. My mixture was too wet and when I fried one it was very soggy. I then squeezed out all the water from the mixture. It was a little better but still fairly tasteless. I think some grated onion or scallions would be better as the leeks were too big (I sliced them thin) and overpowering in taste and in texture. Two thumbs down from me.....sorry!
