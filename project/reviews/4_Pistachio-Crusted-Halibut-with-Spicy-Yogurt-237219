Excellent - made it as written. Even my picky, fish-hating 10-year-old ate it and wants me to make it again. Perfect midweek meal.

I found this dish to be truly outstanding. I fed my finicky brother some of the leftovers the next day, and he was wowed too. He asked for the recipe. Score!

Made this for dinner last night and it was a HIT!! Even with 3 people who are not big fish fans. Yes, the sauce makes a lot more than you need for this but that's great because it was so good I can't wait to eat it on something else.

This was a delicious meal. It comes together quickly and easily. I followed the recipe as stated. It is important to chop the pistachios very fine. I used a mini processor and did not have any trouble getting the coating to adhere to the fish. I made one substitution in the spicy yogurt sauce; I used some dried chili peppers instead of the maras pepper. The yogurt sauce was like a spicy Greek tziki sauce. I served this with a asian chopped salad. Great meal and will definitely repeat.

I want to put the spicy yogurt sauce on everything. It's THAT good. Make sure the pistachios are super fine or it won't stay on the fish. Will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe and my husband raved about it. It's rare that you find a truly new preparation. Note: make sure to really chop the pistachios to be super fine or even put in a mini food processor. I couldn't find maras pepper so used cayenne which was fine.

I made this - but with modifications. I was concerned that the crust falling off would be a problem - as I have had this problem with other recipes. So I made the nut/cornmeal mix but cooked according to the instructions for the Roasted Halibut with Walnut Crust that is on this site (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Roasted-Halibut-with-Walnut-Crust-240087). So I just put some butter on the fillets, pressed in the coating on the top of the fish and baked in the oven. It was amazing. I didn't have to finely grind the pistachios so the texture was great. Highly recommend the fish recipe. I made the yoghurt with cayenne as suggested by others, but I won't bother with the yoghurt the next time because I found it didn't add to the dish. The fish on its own is a 4-fork. Will definitely make again ... when fresh halibut is on special :-)

Meh. I made the recipe exactly as written except substituting fresh cod since Whole Foods had sold out of halibut. It wasn't bad, just nothing interesting. It tasted exactly like the simple ingredients, but since none of the ingredients have much flavor, except for the maras pepper, there just wasn't much to grab our tastebuds. My husband and I thought it was fine, but not worth making again.

I just made this and couldn't shut up about how much I liked it. The crunch of the cornmeal was great, and I can't wait to use it instead of traditional breading on other dishes. I used a mini food processor to get a finer chop on the pistachios, and I think that did the trick. I didn't lose any of the crust while cooking. For those having trouble with crust falling off, try a finer chop. You might also make sure you're using a high-fat milk. I have a feeling that will help your crust adhere to the fish.

Rating: 4
This fish was delicious. I added some grated fresh parmesan to the breading. The yogurt was good but I thought unnecessary because the fish was very flavorfull by itself. I might try a little egg next time to ensure the breading sticks well. Yogurt sauce makes a ton - I cut it in half and still had way too much. Even the kids loved this dish. Keeper!

This is a fabulous dish that looks great, tastes great and is super easy to make. I followed the recipe pretty much as is except for the yogurt I did not add lemon juice as the yogurt was already quite sour. I also used 1/3 of a red onion in the yogurt and one of those mini spicy peppers in it instead. For the fish, make sure you chop of the pistachios very finely because otherwise they won't stick to the fish. Once I had put the fish in the pan I used some of the left over milk and sprinkled just a little on the face of the fish that was up so I could pat some more pistachio crumbs onto the fish. I served it with quinoa in which I mixed in some diced green onions and sliced black olives. All in all it took me 20 min of prep and 10-12min of cooking time.

For the most part, it was tasty, but the pistachio / cornmeal crust just fell off while in the pan. Not sure if I did something wrong?

Delicious and easy! The yogurt sauce was divine - we had Italian parsley but will try with fresh dill next time.

Very good fish! Had a thick piece of halibut which needed more than 8 minutes to cook. Loved the crunch of the cornmeal. Next time I would add some spiciness to the nut/cornmeal mixture. Husband does not like dill, cucumber or raw onion so majorly modified the yogurt sauce.

Directions were right on - 8 min was perfect! Had to skip the dill and sub'd 1t cayenne peppar - drained the shredded cuke before adding to yogourt. Delicous dish!

I had a lb. of halibut in the fridge and had no idea what to do with it...THIS WAS PERFECT! Super fast and easy but oh so delicious. I baked the halibut and it was just as crispy with way less fat. I used crushed Anaheim pepper flakes (cause I couldn't find maras peppers) and threw a little panko bread crumbs with the pistachios in place of the cornmeal. A perfect pairing of ingredients for a quick, yet sophisticated dish :)

we loved it and will make it again. (our substitutions: 1 tsp. ground (cayenne) red pepper (no more or it will be too spicy) for the maras pepper; 1/4 tsp. dried minced onions instead of finely chopped onion (we don't like chopping nor eating raw onion); 1 7-ounce container of greek yogurt instead of 8 ounces; and european cucumber (didn't bother removing any seeds, i don't think they have any.)

It was an amazing piece of Halibut, I used goat butter and pistachio oil...quite good. The yogurt dressing was lovely and I used green chiles to make it seriously spicy-hot. I finished it briefly under the broiler.

Great, simple, really really tasty recipe. I thickened 3% yogurt by straining for 30 minutes through a cheesecloth. My spicy yogurt was made with paprika, cayenne, garlic, lime, salt and pepper and was really good with the fish. Served with couscous made with veg stock and mixed with cranberries and the pistachio bits that fell off the fish into the pan. Side was salad with beets and a creamy horseradish dressing.

Followed recipe exactly - fish was very good. Didn't care for the yogurt dressing - way too tart. I'll make the fish again, but will finish it off in the oven.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe. I was actually surprised I made it, it was so good. I'll definitely make it again, especially when I have guests to impress. > > I changed a few things because I didn't find them at the market. > > Instead of halibut, I used a thick piece of deep red tuna. The thickness is important so you get that beautiful red center after searing it on each side for 2.5  3 minutes. > > I also omitted the maras pepper from the yogurt and instead added wasabi to the milk marinade to give the fish a little heat. I might rub it directly on the fish next time to get more of a kick. > > I paired the dish with Shepherd's Salad and the combo couldn't have been more perfect for a hot summer night. > > I'll have to add the salad recipe as it isn't on Epicurious.com

I also baked at 400 convection about 12 minutes. Instead of the yogurt sauce I combined mayo, yogurt, capers and sambal oelek for some zip. We really enjoyed the combination.

Hmmm... the halibut was great with the nut/cornmeal crust but I didn't find that the yogurt went with it at all. It overwhelmed the delicate flavour of the fish. I will try making a different type of sauce with it next time.

This was awesome, fast and easy! I will absolutely do it again. Instead of adding the pepper to the yogurt, however, I used Aleppo Pepper and added it to the Pistachio/cornmeal mixture. Yum! I served with a mixed cabbage slaw which paired nicely with the fish.

Simple and very tasty fish. Found the yogurt too harsh to consider using with delicate fish flavours. Made a gentle riata instead and laid the fish on a bed of wilted English spinach dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. Will serve again.

Excellent. I used Mahi Mahi as Halibut is a spring fish. Turned out great. The fish was fairly thick so I pan-fried first and then finished in the oven. I used cayenne instead of maras pepper and put a bit too much in, so just added more of the other ingredients to balance it out. I would suggest substitution of 1/2 - 1 tsp of cayenne depending on how spicy you like your food. Was happy to have extra yogurt sauce as I am eating the leftovers with pita bread and it's delicious. Hope to try this again with Halibut and with maras pepper as the recipe calls for.

I made this recipe last weekend while I was housesitting... My friend didn't have a nonstick pan, so I used one that was not nonstick. That said, use a non-stick pan. The crust didn't stick to the fish. Stuck to the pan. I'm going to try it again using my own pan. The spicy yogurt dip is divine! I'm addicted to it now.

The reason they tell you to dip the fish in milk is to remove any "fishy' taste.Should not have to do it with fresh fish, then again I'm a Kiwi and spoiled on fish, caught in the morning, eat at night.

I made this dish last night and thought it was excellent. I served it with couscous. I used red snapper instead of halibut, and cayenne pepper in lieu of maras, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty accurately - except I think I used a lot more cucumber and dill than the recipe called for (I wasn't really measuring). I really liked the cucumber yogurt sauce a lot - I've never tried making tziki (sp.?) at home and I was pleased to find out how easy it was. I would definitely consider making it to go with a simpler grilled fish or maybe even chicken. I did have one question though - does anyone know what the purpose of soaking the fish in milk is? Anyway, great recipe!

To the writer from Philadelphia. I haven't made this recipe yet, but I do know about yogurt sauce. My family is from Lebanon and yogurt in many various forms is a staple on every table. Try adding a couple of cloves of fresh garlic,fresh mint,onions and leave off the lemon. Also, if you like sweet and savory add some chopped walnuts and rasins, which will make it a completely different sauce, but a really good sauce as well.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. I think the yogurt sauce is a must to give it personality though. Because I don't care for the smell of fried fish, I drizzled the oil over the top, baked for 10 minutes and then broil for 2 to crisp the top...not the same, I know but, pretty close.

Rating: 3
This was excellent...used hogfish (OK it's not Med but its local). To the question about baking instead of frying: with a convection oven I always bake, at 400 on a thin old jelly roll pan, not non-stick, which I coat with a thin film of olive oil and then spray the top side of the fish or whatever with OO spray (or PAM). Don't know if I'm really saving fat calories, but it's easier to clean up, always comes out crisp, and I can do other things while it's baking. Just have to know the oven and the fish (or whatever) to not overcook.

The fish was fantastic--and easy--but the spicy yogurt sauce pairing was less than thrilling. Does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative?

to greenville question - I would guess baking by the 'halibut rule' - I think it's 400F, 10 min per inch of thickness, would work ok but you won't get the crispy outside as in the suggested method?

Substituted cod (as Halibut is not Mediterranean) and served this with other Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Got rave reviews! Yummy!

This was terrific. I paired it with the Portugese greens soup (without the sausage and using half kale, half collards), a rice pilaf with carmelized onions, and a lemon semifreddo, all from this site and making a full tour of the Mediterranean. It was a great meal. The leftover yogurt sauce worked very well with spicy black bean burgers.

This info came from chefshop.com and they sell this for about $4.95. Maras pepper is a staple, along with Urfa pepper, on tables all across Turkey where it is often used in place of black pepper. It is bright and deep red with a moderate heat. Grown under full eastern Mediterranean sun, with plenty of water and the gentle, cooling breezes of Turkey, these peppers develop a delicious flavor of their own. Maras Red Pepper Flakes are wonderful in stews, creating a richness that melds the meat flavors with the other herbs and spices. In Turkey these flakes are sometimes added to a kind of frittata made with grated squash and scrambled egg. The pepper and the egg love each other. Or, add a few flakes to yogurt mixed with finely diced cucumber and salt.
