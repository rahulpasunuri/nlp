This is one of the best mustard green recipes ever. I grew a batch of red mustards this year and have made this 4 times already. Brought it to a Mardi Gras party and had several requests for the recipe. The last time I had no onions, but a huge batch of green onions, and it worked almost as well.

The Spicy Mustard Greens with Cumin were great. I put too much cumin in them the first time I cooked them; but the second time I reduced the cumin, and they were delicious. My husband asked me why I didn't cook more.

Pretty good for an impromptu use of mustard greens. I used the thicker parts of the greens, and it was pretty tasty with this concoction. I do agree that I probably put too much cumin seeds; I would dial down on that. But overall, pretty easy and tasty.

Delicious. Though I din't have cumin and balsamic vinegar I substituted using white wine vinegar and ginger poweder. Onions are delcious with Mustard Greens!

The recipe follows my standard way of cooking greens except for the addition of cumin and balsamic vinegar. I thought the cumin overpowered the flavor of the greens and preferred the greens without the cumin. Balsamic vinegar addition was ok.

Excellent! Tasty, easy, and not at all fussy. We used somewhat more greens, and they were all gone well ahead of the rest of the meal. I don't cook greens very often, so I can't really compare, but these left nothing to be desired.

Greens have a tendency to cook down to what seems to be nothing and not be terribly attractive, but these are packed with flavor. The heat and cumin really come out. This is easy to make and a nice accompaniment to the green apple and celery salad, cornbread casserole with mole, and purchased pumpkin pie.
