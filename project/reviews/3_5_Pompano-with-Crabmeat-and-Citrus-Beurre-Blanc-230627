I made this with Tilapia and was oh so pleasantly surprised at the richness added to an otherwise bland fish by this recipe. The only deviation I made was to add more zest than called for, I zested one lemon, threw the lot in. It was fabulous. I served it with baked Asparagus and Potatoes Suzette. The sauce made the Asparagus jump to life also, a wonderful variation on buerre blanc.

The sauce is so good. I made this recipe and then customized half of it for the kids. I used chicken instead of fish and no crab meat. It was a big hit :}

Very quick and easy and lots of flavor that does not over power=I used northern cod...and everyone loved it

I made this without the crab and it was still delicious. Decided not to finish the sauce with lemon peel and also cut down a little on the butter, and it was still fabulous. I had to boil it down a little longer than the recipe called for in order for it to thicken. Served it with roasted vegetables and it was a hit. Will definitely make it again!

This was very good. I didn't add the lemon peel at the end and the taste was excellent. I used tilapia and served it with lemon scented saffron rice (from this site) and spinach. My boyfriend thought I had ordered take-out from a fancy restaurant!!

Delicious! I tweaked the recipe a bit as we are trying out South Beach and it was still yummy. I skipped the egg/flour dredging and used a bit of olive oil and butter and got a nice crust on the filets. In addition, I used half whipping cream and half water for the sauce. I used tinned chunk crab meat for the topping and used its juice in the sauce - so rich and tasty. I will definitely make this again - takes the "fishiness" out of fish!

This had a wonderful flavor. It would also be good with chicken or even pasta.

I also made this with Tilapia, and it turned out perfectly. I think I didn't cook down the sauce enough, and it was a bit heavey (as in tasted fattening, not too thick) inspite of the citrus flavor. Also, I topped it with scallops because they were a great deal, and sauted them lightly in butter with some garlic and finished them with a bit of lemon zest so that they went. Served with a fresh salad and lemon scented rice, it was very good, just shy of great.

Delicious!! I've made this a few times now with Tilapia and everyone in my family loved it! I use only 1 TBL of lemon juice...otherwise a little too lemon for us! I've also used fresh crab meat that we broiled with lemon & butter in it's shell before shelling..

For those who are having trouble with flour sticking to fish, dip fish in flour first and shake off excess, then dip into egg mixture and back into the flour.

WOW! I made this sauce to go with cod which I cooked in foil with white wine. It was fantastic. Really simple (although I'm a bit slapdash with measuring!) I used a good 2 cups of wine and 1/2 a pint of cream to serve 6. The sauce was equally delicious with the asparagus I served as an accompaniment. I did leave out the lemon zest at the end as the flavour was so perfect without it. Definately one to keep and use again.

I thought this was decent, but for all the fat in the dish, I would expect it to be amazing...otherwise it just doesn't seem worth all the guilt.

So-So. Too tart. Too bland. Not much depth behind mixtures of flavors to creat a fabulous dish. Too much lemon. The fish was very good and tender because I used the very best fish available. The sauce could have had salted butter since it made no different in the out come of the sauce. Added honey (Sue Bee) to cut the over all tartness of the sauce. I will use principles from the general recipe directions but will not make the recipe again. I was starving this evening with moving to my new apartment, working all day and taking the dogs to the beach. I need food and I will eat the leftovers tomorrow. Enjoy your try. Devin Ann Nielsen

WOW! I cooked this for my husband and it was a great hit! All of it was very easy. I didn't use the crab, and had to substitue lime for the lemon. It was still great. I too had a problem with the flour sticking, but with work, it stuck. I am going to cook this for some friends next week - It was that good.

I only made the sauce and served it over grilled mahi mahi (without the crab). It was really good and was easier and held better than regular beurre blanc made without cream. I served the fish over a bed of arugula with asparagus on the side. I would definitely make the sauce again and recommend it for any fish or just plain asparagus.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge success. The combination of fish with the sauce over the top was unbelievable. I used tilapia because we have no pompano in CA. I highly recommend it for a very light tasting meal. I served it with lemon scented rice and sauteed spinach.

The sauce was great and the dish was a huge hit. My only problem was properly executing the dipping and flouring of the fish. The coating didn't really stick. Still, I'll make it again; it had a great flavor. I used tilapia.
