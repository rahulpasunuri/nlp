This is a good recipe but I will do a revision on it and will tell you about it later.

We loved this dish; so much, in fact, that I've used "melted garlic" for a variety of other things including fish and pasta. My guys like it when I saute a mild white fish like Tilapia or Sole and serve it beside the rabe, also topped with the melted garlic. Another reviewer said garlic got chewy: heat was too high if that happened - monitor it closely. And as to (over) boiling the greens - we who love all that dark bitter goodness agree - steam (preferable) - or boil for less time. BUT - I've found that when introducing Rabe to those who aren't usually greens eaters - over-boiling can be a friend as it denatures the green.

Didn't really find the garlic to "melt"... got kind of chewy instead. The oil got infused with a delicious garlic flavour though. A pretty good recipe but nothing spectacular.

the garlic was delicious, though the broccoli rabe was overcooked after boiling for the recommended time.

This was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner table. I added sundried tomatoes for an extra punch of flavor and they really made it great.

My husband loves bagna calda so this was perfect for him! We couldn't find broccoli rabe so we used rapini from the farmers market

A big hit with my family and dinner guests. I am a fan of boiling as opposed to steaming as I find it draws off the bitterness of the Broccoli Rabe. A handful of chopped sun dried tomato briefly sauteed in olive oil and added to this dish is really good.

I make this quite a bit my family loves it. I never use that much olive oil and use extra virgin and I steam not boil before I saute. Cut it up small discard bottoms before I saute (which make it more tender and I saute small amounts and serve with lemon slicesand italian country bread mmmmm delicious and good for you!
