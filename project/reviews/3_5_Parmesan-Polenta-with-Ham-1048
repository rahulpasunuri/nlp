Simple, tasty, and fast, what can be better on a weeknight! I added spinach, onion and garlic as recommended and it was very tasty and filling. I did not double it and there were NO leftovers with 4 people. Will make again.

I have made this for years and it is always amazing. Try making it with finely ground corn meal which will yield a creamy very smooth polenta. Also vary the cheeses and/or add fresh corn. I often omit the ham and serve it with a vegetable ragu of tomatoes and seasonal vegetables. Without the ham it is a wonderful vegetarian entre.

I really like the basic idea here and that's what I'm giving 4-forks. I modified it as follows. I doubled the recipe to ensure leftovers. For liquid, I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. I used 1/2 the butter called and parmesan. I trimmed and quartered a pound of regular white mushrooms and sauteed them in 3 T. of butter. When the shrooms were almost done, I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic. and let it get translucent. I added the mushroom/garlic mix when I added the ham. Make sure you use unsalted butter. The parmesan and ham contain plenty of salt. If you don't like salty food, don't add any extra salt.

I love this recipe. It has everything I'm looking for in a one-dish meal: carbohydrates, protein and fat, not to mention deliciousness. I sometimes vary the meat and use bacon or a good quality sausage, and sometimes I use another cheese like a sharp cheddar. And then again there are those days that I put some sauteed and cooled vegetables in too: onion, zucchini, cooked and squeezed chopped spinach or even sun dried tomatoes. That way I get everything I need for one meal, all in one delicious dish. I always double the recipe and cut some up into wedges and freeze them. I've also reduced the butter to about half, and substituted half the milk with chicken stock, to no adverse reactions at all. I'm going to make some right now!

This is George Carlin's infamous "meatcake"! I found it very salty, and the ham I made it with was not a salty ham. My husband wouldn't eat it at all and I wound up throwing most of it out. My 3 1/2 yr old thought it was ok.

This was a wonderful surprise and a great way to use up leftover ham. I added a bit more ham and cheese than the recipe called for. When it came out of the oven it was golden, creamy, and not at all rubbery, a problem I have sometimes had with polenta in the past. We had it for dinner, but it would also make a terrific brunch dish.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used a little more parmesan than the recipe called for. It was also excellent the next day. I will make this again.

Delicious recipe. Good cold or hot. I make it when it looks like a snow storm might knock out our power. Too much fat in recipe, though. I put much less butter in and sometimes substitute other cheeses for the parmasan.

A good recipe for leftover ham, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again. It was a bit bland. I livened it up with a tomato sauce.

What a simple and delicious way to use left over ham! I've made this recipe several times as a main dish--it's great prepared the night before--and would have no hesitation serving it as a brunch side dish. It's a definite keeper.

A tasty, stylish, economical way to feed a crowd -- this recipe "scales up" well. Great leftovers, too. I added a bit of fresh rosemary.

Easy quick great recipe, everyone I have served this to loved it. You can use lowfat milk and decrease the butter for a lower fat version and it is still great. Make a lot it is not a heavy dish.
