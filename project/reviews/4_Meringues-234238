They turned out perfectly. I made small individual size and plan to dip the bottom in chocolate like the recipes for meringue stars. And fill with a frozen raspberry concoction like another recipe. But this meringue recipe was perfect.

This is a very nice recipe. I truly love these meringues.

Very easy and delicious. I've used raspberry extract as an alternate flavoring and have also piped the meringue into shapes, letters, numbers, etc to decorate cupcakes and such. A favorite of kids and adults.

This is a very easy, classic meringue recipe. I squeezed it easily out of a gallon zip-lock bag with the tip cut out.
