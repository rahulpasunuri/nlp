I also stuffed the fish with cilantro and add a little wine to the sauce. Wonderful!

Simple, beautiful preparation for a gorgeous whole fish. I didn't change anything -

I didn't have scallions, and so made it with leeks....delicious! The only negative was that the fish didn't hold its shape once it was served, and looked a bit mushy. As such, you would want to serve the whole fish at the table rather than putting it on plates in the kitchen before serving. Next time I will try it with fillets.

This dish was both easy and delicious. I, too, plant to add rice wine or plum wine to the liquid next time I make this to cut the salt. I would also add more vegetables with the fish.

Loved it! What a simple and delicious preparation of sea bass. Next time I may try adding a little chinese rice wine or plum wine for a touch of acidity and sweetness (and to cut back on the salt), but on the whole it was a fabulous dish! Simple to prepare and yummy.

So easy and very yummy- made even easier by using 5oz fillets instead of the whole fish. I also added green beans and thinly cut strips of red pepper to the cooking pan for color, crunch and a well rounded plate. Then I served the fish, veggies and pan sauce over a simple coconut rice- another recipe from epicurious but I added a bit of raw sugar to the coconut milk while cooking for a bit of sweetness. Will definately make again.

This dish was superb. I cooked the whole sea bass as described with the roasting pans. Prior to cooking the fish, I also added cilantro and lemongrass to the scallions and ginger and put this inside the cavity as well. I let the fish get to room temperature before putting it in the oven. Also, I used sesame oil on the foil that I tented the fish with. All the flavors came together during the steaming process. The fish was moist and extremely flavorful..definitely would make it again. We also made orange duck wontons and soba noodles to accompany the whole fish.
