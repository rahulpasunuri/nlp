The sauce does not serve to complement the veal. My experience was quite mediocre -- as a matter of fact my husband and I tasted the sauce before we put it over the veal and decided to leave it off. The veal with the port was just right. I was annoyed not to find a recipe for beurre manie. The description/definition is not sufficient!

Fabluous sauce! Making it again to serve on chicken (so much cheaper than veal!) Not dietic by any stretch, but so classy!

This recipe is definitely not a keeper!! The port and cream destroy the taste of good veal. It has a sweet taste that overpowers the veal. This is the first recipe from Epicurious that we haven't liked and I felt it was a waste of good quality veal!!

This recipe is so DELICIOUS! I thought the sauce would taste too much like port wine, but it is actually quite subtle. It is a repeat! Wonderful for entertaining, with side dishes you can prepare ahead of time.
