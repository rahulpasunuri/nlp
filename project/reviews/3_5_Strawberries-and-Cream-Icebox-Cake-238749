This was absolutely yummy. I followed the recipe to the T and it not only tasted delish, it looked fabulous as well when I released it from the Springform pan. I used a bread knife to cut it and it didn't get mushy at all. It's important to chill it well. It's worth the wait, I promise. This is so easy to make that it inspired me to start thinking of other ways to use the pastry cream. I would like to incorporate this into a chocolate recipe. Cocoa perhaps? We'll see.

This was a great strawberry dessert. I couldn't find sponge cake-type ladyfingers, used savoiardi instead and the crispness was a nice contrast to the creamy filling....others may want a more cake-y ladyfinger. This was a hit with everyone, great flavor; rich yet light. It was fairly easy to make for something that looked so impressive. Make sure to chill each step at least the amount of time recommended---easily made the day before.
