Oh my yum. We made this last night and got rave reviews from all four diners. It was delicious, just don't forget to add the reserved 'goat cheese' in with the rosemary sauce - it is not explicit in the recipe.

This recipe was just delicious! Loving the taste of roasted beets as much as I do, my friend suggested roasting them for an hour. They turned out great, and allowed us to just use a knife to thinly slice them. We also used half pine nuts, half cashews to cut down on the cost of the "goat cheese."

I didn't bother with the sauce; I made a half batch of the "cheese" with raw cashews instead (to cut the cost of the dish) and probably could have made a quarter batch of the cheese and still not eaten it all. Which isn't to say it's not good - it's quite good. I'm going to make it again this week and make a triple batch of the beets so I can eat it for several days. I used walnut oil in the marinade, didn't bother with the raviolis, just topped beet slices with a bit of the cheese and drizzled with a very nice reduced balsamic for a delicious, beautiful and quick lunch.

my girlfriend made this last night as an appetizer for our gourmet club's dinner - the theme was vegetarian. The recipe is not really clear that the reserved "goat cheese" should be blended in with the sauce ingredients - hence our sauce was basically blended water with lemon and rosemary. FYI - even with the lemon "sauce" this was an amazing, tasty dish - and beautiful on the plate. Rating would have been 4 forks if the recipe had been more explicit.

I was going to make this for a valentines day appie but with everything else I was doing, it was too much work. I just finished making the cream pine nut "goat cheese sauce" as I spent $16.00 CA on pine nuts and didn't want to waste the soaking nuts! Not a cheap recipe thats for sure. The goat cheese sauce is more like a chick pea hummus than goat cheese. I actually bought goat cheese to go with it as i think it would be really nice with this recipe (i am not a vegan but a veggie). I tried soaking the beets and they just got curly but not really workable...so i dont know what to do with this cream sauce other than use it as cracker dip which i think will work well with the ladies and some vino! good luck to everyone else with this recipe-let me know how it works!

I was so excited to come across this recipe. This is a RAW food recipe and the cream is made from the pine nuts. You can also do a similar "cream" using cashews. It looks delicious. Key is to soak the beets. Key is to use the nut cream to enhance the flavors! Enjoy! I will make this soon.

Usually "raw" food is vegan, hence the missing cream.

This sounds really interesting, but I'm a little confused. While looking through the posted ingredients, cream does not appear to be listed.

These look absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to make them.
