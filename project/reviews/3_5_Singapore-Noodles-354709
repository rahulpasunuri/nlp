First time I made this, it tasted bland to me. My mistake was using Shillings curry. I went out of my way to find an Indian grocery store and bought a big bag of hot Indian curry for half the price of a teeny bottle at my local Safeway. The right curry makes a HUGE difference.

I made this for our gourmet group's "Pan Asian" night and it was a huge hit! I rated this a 3 fork because I needed to make some changes to get it to 4 forks. First, I used the thicker (linguine thickness) rice noodles. I soaked them in warm water for about 45 minutes and then added them into the skillet WITHOUT boiling them first. This achieved the perfect texture for the noodles. Since I wasn't boiling water for the noodles, I just threw the shrimp in with the onions towards the end of that cooking block. Also, I had to really up the amount of curry used....I believe I ended up somewhere around 4 T and it could still have used some more kick for the adults in the house. :) My hubby has now decreed that this dish must be repeated SOON! :)

I followed this recipe pretty closely and the noodles turned out dry (broke up into little bits) and bland but tasted "okay". The only modification I made was I added some chicken instead of pork. So based on the original recipe, I'm rating this "one fork" which is not bad according to the rating system. The second time I made this, I cooked the noodles directly in the pan (without boiling it in a pot first) and added about 1.5 cups of water, a little bit at a time and let the noodles soak up the water. I also added more curry powder, soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, and pepper. The second batch was more flavorful and the noodles stayed in tact. I would rate my second batch "two forks" which is "good" according to this rating system. And speaking of the rating system, I think it is misleading because it seems people are rating their own modified and improved recipes rather than the original recipe.

Very good and simple recipe but like other reviewers, I needed to spice it up a little by adding more curry and fish sauce the second time around. The result was outstanding. A definite winner.

Good recipe as a start but it required quite a bit of tweaking on our end. We added about 4X times more curry powder, broccoli, crushed red pepper, onion powder, green onions, mushrooms and garlic powder. A generous amount of fish sauce also helped but in my opinion the two eggs we added at the end really brought the dish together. Make sure to mix them around with the pasta. Also, if your noodles turn out dry just add more oil.

Pretty good. I had a taste just after adding the curry powder, and it tasted gross, but it all came together after the fish sauce and seasoning to taste.

this is very easy, quick, and delicious. I was trying to use up ham from easter, and came across this recipe. did not add shrimp. I added some garlic to the onions. My only complaint is the noodles were a bit dry, so i added some cream to loosen it up. I will make it again, soon.

Excellent dish! I added sliced green onions and red pepper for extra color and flavor. I used 2 tablespoons of Madras curry powder because I cooked 16 oz of noodles. Believe me, you will be glad you did! Yum, so good!

Easily the most authentic looking and tasting Asian food results I've ever accomplished; subbed the meat from 1 sweet Italian sausage in for the roast pork (sauteed early on with spring onions), added garlic, mushrooms and snow peas, lots more curry than called for. Easy and quick; I will definitely be serving this again.

Omitting the meat/shellfish/pork, I made this as a side dish, alongside tilapia prepared with a Thai-style marinade and grilled asparagus. Delicious meal.

I love Singapore noodles, but got tired of flavorless takeout from the Chinese and Thai restaurants in my area. This was the most flavorful version ever! I tweaked it a little to suit my taste by eliminating the shelled peas and pork, increasing the shrimp, and adding carrots and snow peas. I didn't want to drive 20+ miles to the nearest Asian grocery for fish sauce, so just subbed 2T soy sauce and 1T lime juice. Do yourself a favor by adding some crushed red pepper, too!
