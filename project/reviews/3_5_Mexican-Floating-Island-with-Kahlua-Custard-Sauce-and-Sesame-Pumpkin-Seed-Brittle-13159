I have made this since it came out in the original issue years ago. It is great, wonderful, impressive and a fab way to end Thanksgiving

Had great potential but I was dreadfully disappointed. 1st step- made pumpkin seed brittle - turned out great- tasted great. The rest was a disaster. Custard sauce very tricky I am an experienced cook and it curdled (even with candy thermometer). Next I made the meringue and it too turned out dreadfully- looked horrible and recipe called for salt but never listed it. An exhaustive process for a huge disappoint - tasted ok- but looked dreadful.

Takes a bit of doing, but this is a wonderful recipe. I kicked up the amount of Kahlua to nearly 1/3 cup and that was well worth while. The Brittle is a recipe worth keeping for a candy file-- made a nice garnish for the islands. My guests loved it.
