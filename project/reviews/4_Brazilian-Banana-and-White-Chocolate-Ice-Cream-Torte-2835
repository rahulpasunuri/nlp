I love this and use the ice cream on its own as well but then I tinker a little bit with the recipe to make it like chunky monkey ice cream by adding bits of fudge and chopped caramel hershey's kisses or adding toffee bits. Thinking about trying rum-soaked raisins to a future batch. One thing I do with all ice cream is add a tablespoon of vodka so it doesn't freeze rock hard. You can also use liqueuer but adjust up or down based on the alcohol percentage. If you make nothing else, make the ice cream. Oh and I split it into 2 churnings for my Cuisinart ice cream maker -- put about 2.5 cups in each churning. Add toffee etc over the last 10 minutes of churning.

We made this recipe 3 years ago for a Brazilian Dinner for 8 that we offered for a local charity auction. They LOVED it, and so did all of us in the kitchen. Word has spread, and we have gotten requests for this dessert 3 times in the last 2 years. All three times we we not serving Brazilian food! This dessert has its own reputation. It is an amazing thing, and it tastes different with ans without the sauce incorporated iwth the bite of torte. So, I have guests try it both ways, and they are amazed at my cleverness, but its really this wonderful recipe.

I didn't make this recipe, one of the members of my gourmet club did and it was incredible! One of the best desserts I have had in a long, long time. The five of us DEVOURED this thing, it is that good. Although word of caution, she had to work pretty fast to put stuff together because the ice cream does melt. Yum, yum, yum!

My gourmet cooking group used this fabulous recipe as part of a fundraiser. We showed the movie "Woman On Top" with Penelope Cruise and did a blow out Brazilian dinner afterwards. This dessert was one of the most talked about courses. It is beautiful when presented and the flavors are sublime. I did it for New Years Eve as scoops of the ice cream with the fruit and chocolate. The people having trouble with volume must be using small table top freezers. I used the traditional ice cream maker and it was done in 20-30 minutes. The do ahead is handy. My favorite recipe of the year.

It's tempting to give this a four fork rating... It is very good (and very rich!). Like the previous reviewer, my ice cream maker could not churn the entire batch at once, so I churned two batches. In all it took about an hour of churning, but as I didn't need to babysit the ice cream maker, it wasn't a big deal. This is a perfect summertime dessert.

I can see the potential of this recipe but I didn't have much success this time around. The volume of the ice cream recipe is large - almost double what could effectively fit in my ice cream maker and I just couldn't get it all to freeze. Only 2/3 of the liquid would even fit in my maker and the rest I just put in the freezer and stirred every now and then (not effective). I finally gave up at midnight after three times the supposed freezing time and poured the "ice cream soup" in the torte and threw it in the freezer. Of course I ended up with banana and white chocolate ice crystals. However, I had a spoonful of the ice cream that did harden in the maker and it was some of the best ice cream I've ever eaten. Be prepared to borrow an extra ice cream maker or do it in two batches (which probably means two different days if you have to re-freeze the container). The key to this recipe is the ice cream so make sure it's done right. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and the crust was delicious. Now that I'm prepared for the potential pitfalls of the recipe I plan to give it another try soon.

This is the most awesome dessert ever made! Any time of year is appropriate. Festive at the holidays and cool in the summer. Save room for this one! Takes a bit of time to prepare but worth the results. Have to ignore fat, calories and carbs. It truely has it all!
