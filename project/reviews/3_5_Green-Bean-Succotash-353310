Very nice. I had a shallot begging to be used so I added it and was pleased with the results. Definitely a keeper, and a way to change up an old stand-by.

I used fresh limas from the farmer's market, which I think would have been great if I had ever met them before in my life. It turns out that you have to cook them a bit beforehand, but I didn't figure that out until I had them in the pan. I added some water and boiled the whole mixture for about half an hour. A bit soggy, but still tasty.

Love this! Have made it a couple of times and will definitely make again. It is odd - I know what all of the flavors in the ingredient list taste like - but they are completely different and unexpected when combined. Lovely!

Yummy! I used frozen edamame instead of the lima beans. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Even better the next day!

Great fresh new way to cook veggies. Delicious! I might add zucchini next time too.

I expected this to be good but I was quite surprised at how truly delicious it was -- and easy to prepare. I used a bit more Old Bay Seasoning than called for, otherwise I followed the recipe. I will absolutely make this again and again. And the leftovers made a fabulous frittata.

This is my new go to vegetable side dish. I loved the flavors and textures of the vegetables from the buttery softness of the lima beans to the crispyness of the corn and green beans. This is very easy and great with grilled fish.

I made this last night to go with grilled chicken and it was delicious. All of the fresh flavors of Spring rolled into one dish. I added more red pepper than it called for (one whole red pepper diced) and that was nice.
