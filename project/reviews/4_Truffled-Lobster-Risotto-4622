Instead of cutting the lobster tails up, I left them whole. To reheat them I sauteed them in butter and served them on top. Also, I added onions, shallots, red and orange bell peppers, mushrooms and asparagus to the risotto. It was AMAZING, looked pretty and got a lot of veggies in :)

I made this for New Years Eve to rave reviews. I parboiled the rice however, which cuts cooking time by half and the results are a very creamy texture. I also used more truffle oil drizzled over just before serving. Worth the effort, an amazing dish. To parboil, rinse rice under water, bring to boil 1 cup of chicken or vegetable stock and 1 cup of water. Add rice and boil for 7 minutes, drain and spread out on a sheet pan to cool. Proceed with recipe, being careful not to over cook rice. Once I had carrots and shallots sautéed, it took about 10-15 minutes to finish.

used crawfish we had from a crawfish boil the day before, 1/4c parmesan and 4tablespoons of white truffle oil and this was fantastic! Restaurant quality.

Very tasty and I didn't find the truffle oil overwhelming in the least. My only change was to use a concentrated shellfish stock that I had on hand from More Than Gourmet, diluted of course to make a stock, to which I boiled the lobster tail shells for awhile before incorporating the stock little by little in the usual way for a risotto. I also added some lobster mushrooms as another reviewer suggested, which I didn't feel added anything. But I'd make it again for special occasions, as it isn't very difficult if you use a shellfish stock.

I made this for a romantic Valentine's dinner and we loved it. I added some sweet corn, which was a lovely touch. I am not a big fan of truffle oil, so I used some porcini mushroom oil, which was a mistake. It was still delicious, but I think the truffle oil would have made this exceptional.

We decided not to put in the carrots but added onion after we sauteed the lobster and shallots in butter. :) We also used cream sherry b/c we didn't have brandy. It was absolutely delish and we will definitely make it again!

What an outstanding meal. I had purchased Lobster tails for a typical broiled tail dinner - and then checked recipes - boy am I glad I did. This is fantastic. Really rich & elegant. Changed the recipe slightly by not cooking lobster until the end - I peeled it and made the stock with the shells, veg's and clam broth. I used onion & garlic & tarragon (what was available). I will make this again definitely.

Oh, and I forgot to add, that I also did as the last reviewer and baked the shells and then simmered them in the broth for 15 mins or so...less messy...

Sooooo good. I live in at a higher altitude, so I ended up adding about 4 cups of broth instead of just 3 1/2...but seriously good. I was a little leery of the truffle oil, just cause it can be very overpowering-I cautiously added it...and I also used leeks in place of the carrots, just a personal preference. My family was wowed none- the-less.

Rating: 3
I made this last night and I have a few tips. I substituted the carrots for leeks which added a soft quality to the dish. Also you can skip the truffle oil and use truffle salt... it has a bigger impact (I also added fresh shaved truffle to the dish as I served it). Finally the broth is helpful in adding flavor but you can just put the shells in the oven for 15min and add it to the broth on the stove (instead of blending it and straining it) and it still gets a great lobster broth flavor and is so much easier.

This made a FABULOUS V-Day dinner!! Very decadent, special, and delicious! I served it with a simple salad of Arugula, apples and goat cheese - a definite winner! I left out the carrots, but did use the brandy...

I respectfully dissent. The reason for using the truffle oil with the carrots and shallots is to infuse both ingredients with the taste of truffle. One should not mess with this stage, olive-oil-lovers notwithstanding. My problem is with the method for the risotto. As anyone who has done risotto knows, dropping some 2L+ of liquid into the rice dish is not the way to do things. I would recommend half the lobster broth, and 1/4 the chicken broth, and then just watch it - every few minutes, add more, and more, and more. In terms of other prep, rather than boiling the lobster, I started with 2L chicken stock, the tails (baked, but not food processor-ed), and the lobster meat itself. This allowed for (a) the meat to be cooked and (b) the broth to be totally immersed in lobster-icious meat and shell. I also added white pepper per a prior suggestion; good add. I don't understand subbing brandy for champagne, as others suggested - that seems like a weird sub to me. The only reason this doesn't get 4 forks is because I had to change too much and at the end of the day I didn't say OMG this is the best dish evah!

Rating: 4
This recipe was delicious and easy. I did make a few changes. I used olive oil to saute and champagne instead of brandy as suggested in earlier posts. I also didn't use carrot and didn't substituate anything for it either. I added a bit more risotto and subsequently a bit more lobster stock and heavy cream. Oh yes, lobster stock--and from scratch. I truly believe that was one of the ingredients that made this dish outstanding. We ate every single bite.

I made this tonight to use up some Lobster tail and crab legs left over from a dinner we went to last night. I did not make a 'lobster broth', but used chicken broth only. I did not modify it much, cutting the carrots down to about 1/3 c, increasing the onion to 1/2 c and adding 2-3 chopped garlic cloves and about 3/4- 1 c of diced baby 'bello mushrooms. I sauteed the onions, carrot and garlic in EVOO and then pretty much followed a standard risotto recipe, adding the mushrooms in about half way through. I plated it and finished with a sprinkling of truffle salt and a drizzle of truffle oil. Tres incroyable!! Served with a lovely chard and the wonderful taste is still lingering in my mouth!

This dish is spectacular. Like the others who reviewed this, I substituted mushrooms for the carrots. I used frozen stock from Balducci's and whole lobsters instead of tails. Next time I will add more lobster so that the dish is meatier. Our fish market cooked the lobsters for no additional charge and gave them to me chilled, a huge time and cleanup saver. Leftovers were delicious as risotto cakes, 15 minutes at 350 and 5 minutes under the broiler.

I served this on New Years Eve. Preparation was a group effort along with my guests. I doubled the recipe to serve 5 and the portions were perfect. I ordered 5 lobsters cooked and meat removed from my local market to save time. They saved the shells for me too. I'm not sure what the weight was but I'm guessing they were around 3 to 4 lbs. There was plenty of meat left over for bisque the next day. I used tarragon instead of chives. Definitely did not saute in truffle oil (I used white which I had on hand) and used mixed mushrooms instead of carrots. I will try using 1/2 cup of brandy and 1/2 cup of sherry next time as noted below. I splurged and paired it with a fabulous Chardonnay from Burgundy and it was beautiful! . Do serve this to guests with somewhat more refined tastes however as the flavor is a bit different and may not be fully appreciated by the meat and potatos crowd.

Update. I was reading a recipe for Lobster Bisque on this site and noted it calls for 1/2 cup of brandy and 1/2 cup of sherry. I will try this next time hoping it adds a bit more depth and cuts the sweetness a little.

We have made this every New Year's Eve for 4 years now. We use Black Truffle Olive Oil, instead of White. The recipe is a process but we enjoy a glass or two of wine while preparing this very unique meal. Some times we serve it with filets to make a surf and turf and other times we add more lobster and use it as the main course. Bon Appetit!

Simply wonderful. As others suggested I sauted using olive oil and added mushrooms and a few chopped asparagus spears. It was a great hit... and even more so when we made risotto cakes with the leftovers the next night!

I have made this dish many times and it is truely a show stopper. Be sure to use high quality truffle oil. Don't bother with lobster tails. They are pricey. Better to just boil whole lobsters. I agree not to saute the risotto in the truffle oil. Allow your guests to drizzle sparingly at the end.

To the cook from Dallas suburbs, a word of friendly advice from a chef...as the great Julia Child used to say "Never, ever apoogize!" And don't give up on truffles, some of the best tastes are aquired tastes but don't try things that you have never tried when you have guests for dinner. Use your senses in the kitchen, if the rice is still crunchy, abandon the recipe and keep adding liquid and cooking the rice until it is the proper consistency. Taste, taste, taste as you go along so you you don't get any surprises in the end. Then you will be confident that the dish is worthy of your table. Happy cooking!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. I substituted fresh tarragon instead of chives. This dish was super decadent. My husband & I paired this dish with Franciscan Oakville Cuvee Sauvage Chardonnay - butter & oak complimented the fabulous flavors of this dish.

I have never been so dissappointed by recipe in all my years of cooking!! My sons girlfriend joined us for this meal and I haven't stopped apologizing yet. I made this recipe step by step using all the ingredients called for. First of all, we had never had truffles or truffle oil. Not a taste I enjoyed. Next, although risotto is a staple in our diet, this did not call for enough liquid and was still crunchy. There was not enough flavor, it was expensive, and time consuming and the end result was that we threw most of it down the garbage disposal (our dog, Zoe)

What I really enjoy about this recipe is the ease in which you can cater it for your own tastebuds. By eliminating the chore of making the lobster stock, I decided to add more lobster and used the shells of three lobster tails in the risotto as I cooked it. I added 1 Tsp of fresh lemon juice at the end to compliment the lobster. I wanted to have a hearty one dish meal after a ten hour day at the office. It took less than 40 minutes to prepare a meal for myself. I definitely plan on making this recipe again for guess, with a different tastebud to fulfill.

I made this for New Years Eve as a side dish and doubled it to serve 12 people. There was plenty left over. It is outstanding. The only changes I made to the recipe were adding 2T additonal cream and reducing the truffle oil 50%(to me it is sometimes overwhelming). It is great the first day and fabulous cold the next day.

Very decadent. Subtle flavors. Changes: Used champagne instead of brandy and truffle shavings instead of carrots. I thinks carrots would have been very good, in hindsight, as would the brandy, if I'd had any. Will make again.

A wonderful dish if you love to spend time in the kitchen as I do, BUT I did turn this recipe on his head a little which is why I gave it only 3 forks - as suggested, I added a little truffle oil only at the end (whoever heard of using such a flavorful oil on high heat?), used red onion instead of shallots, and made a lobster stock just by boiling the shells, head, and goodies from 2 whole lobsters and straining. Instead of cream I added a dry aged grated Velha Monterey Jack (I hate the taste of cream) and added also at the end which did not detract from the dish at all and added a subtle richness. Also used lobster mushrooms instead of carrots and one minced garlic clove... so the recipe gave me a good idea, but I didn't follow it completely and the result was WONDERFUL. Agree with other reviews this recipe is good but not as wonderful as it should be.

I found the risotto to be poridge like and think that perhaps it is due to the instructions on preparing it that I followed to a T. I would suggest following the instuction on the box that the risotto comes in instead.

Labour intensive but worth it. I made this for Valentine's dinner and my husband loved it. Used olive oil to saute the shallots, as suggested by another reviewer, and drizzled the truffle oil on top. Also sprinkled a pinch of Fleur de Sel along with the chopped chives, to finish. Used mushrooms, as they are more sensual than carrots. Served it with roasted asparagus (very simply tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with Sel Gris).

This is wonderful. I have used both live lobsters and frozen lobster tails. The taste lingers pleasantly

One of the most important steps in this dish is using a decent stock to add to the risotto as it cooks. This dish has the potential to be incredibly flavorful or bland, as any risotto can be, without decent stock. I wouldn't used canned chicken stock (ever!) UNLESS you are in a major time crunch (and then risoto really isn't the best choice for the ocassion you are planning). Make a light chicken stock in advance and then perform then use this to blend with the cooked pieces of lobster shells. If you find this dish bland then it is likely suffereing from a common problem--lousy stock! A touch of white pepper is also nice for flavor while keeping the color.

Elegant Christmas eve recipe. Everyone loved it. Truffle oil added heavenly scent and flavor, altho I cut it back to 2T. Substituted wild mushrooms for carrots which melded wonderfully with truffle flavor. For easy prep use frozen lobster meat, 'Better than Bouillion - Lobster' for lobster 'stock' and supplement stock with white wine.

Decadent risotto - made for New Years Eve dinner. Definitely save for a special occasion because there is a lot of prep work. Doubled recipe and it only served 6 for dinner, not 8. Used some reduced lobster cooking liquid and reserved the truffle oil only for the finished dish -- it was enough.

We have made this a few times for special ocassions or just for a little something special. Definitely spare the truffle oil, use it only to drizzle at the end. Cook everything in olive oil - keeps it light. Wonderful to share with company. I add an extra tail so there is more lobster meat.

Very tasty and even better the next day! I also used whole lobsters and then reduced some of the liquid they were cooked in instead of chicken broth for a heartier lobster flavor which did not overwhelm the taste of the truffle oil. I was also fortunate enough to have some truffle shavings to add. Excellent dish, but very time consuming.

Very good recipe. Only slight modification is that you need to boil more chicken broth because after I had finished using the 2 1/2 cup of chicken broth that I had boiled, my risotto was still a little too al dente.

This risotto was a great hit among all guests at my dinner party. I used whole lobsters instead of just tails. I thought it added more texture and color to the dish. When making the broth, I boiled the claw shells in a pot. Shells were then discarded and that broth was used in the blender with the baked tail shells. The end result was a full-flavored lobster broth. I followed other cooks suggestions of using the truffle oil just before serving the risotto.

Yes, how DO you rip a tail off a live lobster!?!?! We cooked "larry" first, then threw in all the meat. It was fabulous and definitely restaurant quality. Make sure you follow through with the lobster stock: it's easy and very important to the flavors.

This was very good and sets the tone for a romantic evening. I too followed the suggestion of cooking with another oil, and the two tablespoons of truffle oil at the end were plenty. I used two whole lobsters, not just the tails, primarily because I've never cut up an uncooked lobster and feared the innards might drain out like the crab guts did on Cast Away. As others have noted, the dish was rich enough to satisfy two, but the servings left a lot of empty real estate on the plate. If that bothers you, you might want to add a light vegetable and/or maybe the meat from the claw as a garnish (if intact). One piece of advice: do follow the instructions and use LOW-SALT CHICKEN STOCK. I used regular, and the finished dish was a tad too salty for my taste but fortunately not so much as to ruin the meal.

I made this for my Birthday last night. Very Yummy. I did double the recipe for 4 of us and there was very little left over. I sauteed the carrots and shallots in olive oil, and sprinkled the chives and truffle oil over the top of each serving. I served it with a mesclun salad mix with basil and italian parsley, toasted pine nut, procuitto, and shaved parmessan, with a warm balsamic vinegrette. It was the perfect foil for the rich risotto. I also had some fleur de sel salt that I sprinkled on the risotto at the end. Very Good!!

Fantastic! While making this for New Year's eve, I was concerned about the small quantity, but it turned out to be plenty because it is extemely rich. Serve it with a very light sald (I served warm goat cheese salad,which was delicious but too rich). Also I was out of brandy, so I used good sherry, which was just fine.

I received as a gift a bottle of fine white truffle oil, and this is the first recipe I made using it. What a sensual dining experience! I made it according to the recipe except, as one reviewer strongly suggested, do not cook the truffle oil....never! drizzle it over or gently mix it in to finish. This got better with every bite, and by the time I finished, I was thinking it was one of the best things I had ever tasted! Also....making risotto in a pressure cooker is the way to go..perfect every time. For this recipe, saute shallots and carrots in a mild oil...I used olive and it was fine....add the risotto, saute a bit...then add the brandy and rest of the liquids. Once it reaches hi temp, it takes exactly 6 minutes to cook, then stir in the lobster, cream and truffle oil. Voila!! Absolutely divine!

Who wrote this recipe? The idea behind a recipe such as this is sensuality, and flavor. Both of which are lost the second you begin cooking your ingredients in the Truffle oil. Use a light oil to cook your ingredients with, and finish the dish by drizzling the Truffle oil over the rice. By doing this, the intense flavor and the sexy lustre of the Truffle oil is presented as it was meant to be. If you've tried this recipe before using the method described, and enjoyed it; make it again using this little tip. (add a slice of seared Foie Gras atop the rice if you dare!)I promise that you will never again know such happiness.

I was disappointed in this dish. I thought it was very flat. We squeezed a little fresh lemon juice over the finished dish to give it a little zip. I think that this recipe is lacking acid.

Impossible not to like this if you like lobster. The aroma of the lobster stock alone is a heady experience. I would have rated this with four forks instead of three had it been slightly creamier. But then again, it could have been that I cooked it a little too much at the end, rather than that the recipe was flawed.

tried this recipie with the pressure cooking method of risotto that I believe was featured a few years ago in Bon Appetit. It was perfect, i used half a lobster tail for each person, and found that I could have cut the lobster down. I also held back some of the truffle oil and drizzled some on top just before serving. The aroma was incredible! I am making it again tonight for a friend's special birthday dinner. It's a winner!

Make this for your boy/girl friend's birthday and you'll get coffee in bed the next morning. I served microwaved asparagus as a side and then the epicurious "Peaches in spiced red wine". You can make the peaches and lobster broth ahead so you can transport the ingredients (as I did) and spend less time chopping, etc.
