Ok, so it's not a bakewell tart, but it is a delicious recipe. Yes it's sweet, but the custard and cookie like crust are wonderful!

I'm sorry, but whoever said thos was a recipe for a 'Bakewell' tart needs to go back to cookery school! I'm not even going to TRY making this, as it sounds more like a jam lined egg custard-cum-creme brulee

this is wrong wrong wrong , the filling is frangipane with a jam lining, what you have here is a manchester tart

My roommate and I found this disappointingly sweet and without much flavor. The individual components were just fine, the custard was very nice and the tart shell came out well, but the tart shell filled with jam, custard and the burnt sugar topping was too sweet. And it seemed like it was crying out for something else on top to give it a purpose and off set the sweetnes (e.g. fruit). Also, don't make this for someone who loves bakewell tart as this won't do it because there is no almond in it. I gave it one fork because the description was "just so so" but probably 2 forks is more reasonable.

This is wonderful. It is definetly a restaurant quality dessert. I made it for Easter Brunch and everyone loved it. I am making it again for a Farewell luncheon.
