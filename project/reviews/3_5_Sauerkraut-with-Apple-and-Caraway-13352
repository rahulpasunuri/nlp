Good with pork,sausages or franks. But do cut the amount of sugar, I used half. Also had to add more liquid (wine).

This was really tasty. I sauteed a thinly sliced onion and then added the apples and sauerkraut. I also added some apple cider to the cooking liquid. Very goood with smoked pork chops and pierogis.

I personally love sauerkraut just as it comes from the jar, but for guests who don't, this is a great recipe. I also put in less sugar. Went very nicely with our sausage, hot potato salad, etc, German dinner.

High marks for simplicity. Could not be easier to make, however much too sweet. Next time I will cut the brown sugar by half.

Rinse Sauerkraut well and squeeze dry. Follow receipe but add 2 tbs balsamic vinegar. Place in CrockPot. Place poached/pricked fresh sausages on top. Cover and cook on low 7-9 hours (while you are at work. Sausage will brown nicely.

There are many recipes similar to this one but I like it all the same. I did, however, add some crushed juniper berries and a bay leaf to get some additional flavour. I also added some lean pork cubes to complete the dish.

If you like sauerkraut, this is the way to go! After cooking completely, I turned off the heat and left it covered on the stove for a few hours until just before dinner when I heated it back up. I served it with baby back ribs with BBQ sauce, kale stuffed onions, and potato and parsnip puree. The leftovers were great in rueben sandwiches.

Made this for New Years day to go with the pork roast. I added a chopped onion and put the whole thing in the crock pot, turned it on high for about 2 hours. It was good - my guests loved it -more than I did, I like it less sweet, more "sour/salty".

Used a dark pilsner beer in place of the wine and chicken both. Always make this on New Year's Day with pork roast - a Pennsylvania Dutch tradition for luck in the new year.

My Irish-German mother always made kraut this way to serve with wursts. Still yummy!

To the cook looking for a substitute for the wine. You could try apple cider in this recipe. That's what I use in a very similar recipe. I also add 1 sliced onion.

I prefer to not use wine in cooking...any suggestions of what to substitute? Our family has spent many years in Germany and loves sauerkraut. Thanks!

I started out by browning a thick slice of bacon & a kelly dog, and sauteeing the onions with them. I toasted the caraway seeds & added everthing to my crock pot. I cooked it overnight, brought it to a picnic & everyone loved it!

Absolutely great! I also added 1 medium chopped onion. Was concerned that I was adding too much liquid, but it was jusst right. I brought it to a boil on stovetop, then baked it covered at 340 for one hour. Perfect!

We used this recipe for our family Christmas dinner along with grilled sun-dried tomato and turkey sausages. Everyone loved it and it was a great alternative to the same old, same old!

I will be making this again, as it satisified everyone!! I don't usually like sauerkraut, even though it is a "Baltimore" Thanksgiving dish. However this was very tasty. Even my Mom, who only likes "plain" sauerkraut liked it.

This is a great recipe. I always bring the sauerkraut to our family's Thanksgiving dinner. I used to add pork chops or ribs, but my sister is now a vegitarian, so I decided to try this and it's delicious! Everyone loved it. I'll bring this to Thanksgiving every year now.
