I agree that this is a very rich dish, but it is also very tasty. The grits had a nice light texture and the cheddar and bacon and green onions are a nice foil with the corn taste of the grits. Make it for special occasions and keep the portions small and this will be a memorable breakfast.

I thought it was too rich. I wouldn't recommend it.
