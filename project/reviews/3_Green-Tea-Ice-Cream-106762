Yuck, way too 'custardy'! But to be fair we tried it fresh out of the ice cream maker, so it was more of a soft serve.. I imagine when it's frozen more it might taste less sweet? Next time I'd likely add more milk and reduce the sugar, and mayhaps reduce the number of eggs to 4 or 2 (we used 6 yolks from our backyard hens. Are storebought eggs more bland??). I've been making Ben & Jerry recipes which use two whole eggs, and they definitely don't come out this sweet and custardy (I substitute half cup of sugar for the 3/4). It also didn't have a very green tea taste to it (maybe because so much of it was sieved out?). Since that 'bitter' green tea taste wasn't strong enough, I imagine that's also a contributing reason to why it tasted too sweet. I might try whisking the green tea first in some hot liquid to get it to dissolve properly, letting that cool, then mixing it with the egg/sugar next time, and not bother with sieving. No problems with scrambling the eggs, but I had it on very very low, which took a lot of time for it to finally get to 170. Overall a lot more trouble to make than typical ice cream. I'll give it a try again with modifications and see if it's more to my liking.

It's a pretty simple recipe. Same rules apply as in making a custard. However, I should have known it wouldn't be great when it called for "whole" eggs. I will make this recipe again, but I will only use yolks. In future, I will put more weight in the reviews. This was a similar complaint in other reviews.

After reading other reviews I was skeptical, but tried this recipe with three modifications. First, I used only 4 eggs. Though most ice cream recipes do call for yolks only, it is not unheard of to use whole eggs, so I went with it. Second, I only brought it up to 165 and did so slowly. Third I use equal parts cream, half and half and whole milk because that was what I had in my fridge. The result was exactly what I was looking for. Yummy!

Ice cream bases are basically custard, and custard is always made from egg yolks, not whole eggs. I immediately knew that the recipe should use 6 egg YOLKS and it turned out fantastic. Epicurious does need to correct the recipe, but as long as you just use yolks and not the whole egg, this will turn out just fine.

After reading the majority of the review of this recipe, It's obvious that a lot of people were having issues with the eggs curding up. So I figured to alter things up a bit. For my version, I used 4 large whole eggs + 4 yokes, seemed to do the trick, nothing curd up and the custard turned out perfect. One problem I had with this recipe is that the base was entirely too sweet, even for me who is the biggest sweet tooth! I tried to fix things up by adding bitter-sweet chocolate chunks into the machine 5 minutes before the ice cream was done freezing to keep the balance of sweet and bitter that everyone loves about green tea ice cream.

Okay okay. The first time I tried this I ended up with green tea eggs. The second time, I reduced the eggs to 5, and was very very careful when bringing the final mixture up to temp. Slow and steady, not fast and furious like I did with attempt #1. No troubles at all! Love it! I'm going to make a second batch tonight, and this time I'm going to give it a go with 4 eggs.

I am a seasoned pro at creme brulee and vanilla ice cream. Never had an egg cook on me, results always fantastic. Not this time! Cooking to 170 degrees? My eggs scrambled themselves in the time I stopped stirring to pick up the pot and pour through a sieve! FDA recommends cooking eggs to 160 degrees. Not sure what is right, but I will not make this recipe again.

This recipe is literally inedible. I made it for some friends and we all agreed it tastes like Triscuit ice cream. Not appealing.

Zero forks! This was just awful...awful taste, awful consistency, awful to prepare.

I didn't try this, so I shouldn't rate it too. But from the responses, there are too many room for errors. One way to escape disaster is: Simply buy less- sugar Vanilla Ice- Cream or one which is milder in the Vanilla Scent...leave out to soften, mix in the Matcha and refreeze... Coconut flavored ice-cream is interesting as a base too with a subtle sweetness and musk. So have fun, spaceman.

This does not look like scramble eggs. You have to be careful when mixing the hot liquid with the eggs. Do it slowly and it will turn out fine. I did put only 4 eggs, and I mixed matcha from the beginning into the sugar. I waited until the custard was cold to put in the cream. It tastes awesome, same taste you get if you try matcha ice cream.

A very expensive disaster. Like other reviewers, I ended up with Green Tea scrambled eggs. Whole eggs is a bad idea, and I should have used yokes like other ice cream recipes. Macha is expensive, as is the basic ingredients. I would try to find another Green Tea Ice Cream recipe.

Absolutely HORRIBLE recipe. Epicurious should remove this. It could easily lead people to dislike a wonderful item.

I definitely altered this recipe a bit using 2 cups of 2% milk and 1 cup heavy cream. I was cautious of using too much fat considering the greasy texture of my first ice creams. I also used only 2 egg yolks and it was delicious. I read that you should generally not use more than 2 whole eggs or 3 egg yolks total per pint of dairy and it seems to work very well. Perhaps the green tea powder I have is very strong, but two tablespoons was way too much, I will cut it in half at least next time...I also added the matcha to the milk/cream mix instead of with the sugar and eggs. Best ice cream texture I've found so far. It is also helpful to know that you should bring your age your custard 4-12 hrs. before churning it and that it should be between 27 and 35 degrees when it goes in to reduce the risk of churning it into butter. Being sure that your mixture does not churn beyond the consistency of thin soft-serve ice cream to avoid a greasy or waxy texture. Hope this helps all those in search of the perfect ice cream recipe.

I have never been so disappointed in a recipe found on epicurious! I ended up with about a cup of usable ice cream base, the rest turned into sweet matcha scrambled eggs! I'm not sure what I was thinking using whole eggs like the recipe calls for and not just yolks.

I increased the amount of matcha (also spelled maccha sometimes) to 3 Tbs because I really wanted a more pronounced flavor, and it worked well with the richness of the custard. I also added the matcha to the warm cream/milk mixture and let it sit a couple of minutes to steep instead of mixing it directly into the egg/sugar mixture. It seems to dissolve more completely that way.

Sorry should be 2 cups milk, 1 cup cream. Did not know how to change my review, so have to post a new one.

Change the recipe per one of the reviewer suggestion to 2 cup milk, 1 cup cream and 3 eggs. Taste great, just like to one we have in Australia. Will make it again.

I took another reviewers advice and used 1 c of cream, 2 cups whole milk, and 3 eggs. I steeped 3 green tea bags in the milk and used 1 tbsp matcha ( I used somethnig called tea tech which I foundin a health food store that is highly concentrated green tea in little one serving package) and cooked the custard with a double boiler --it came out fabulous. I am going to try with earl grey next.

This recipe was good - I agree with other users that more green tea powder would allow a stronger flavor. I also added 5 or six tablespoons of sugar toward the end of my machines 20 min cycle, which added a bit more sweetness and texture.

Three out of the four people to whom I served this ice cream, really liked it. It's a little messy to make - if you're not used to making custards often, there's a bit of a degree of difficulty here. The ice cream does have a delicious taste and texture and a beautiful green color. Some people just won't like the taste of green tea in ice cream - there's not much you can do about that. I will say that the amount of matcha I used is the amount quoted in the recipe - I don't think I would add any more. Perhaps the quality of the matcha has something to do with it?

I have tried several green tea ice cream recipes, without luck. This one has been the best by far! I think next time I make it though, i would put a little more matcha tea. The flavor could have been stronger. But it was light and delicious, definitley a winner!

I have never made ice cream before until today. The Green Tea Ice Cream is my first try and I used a Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice Cream Maker. Overall, the green tea flavor need to be stronger so the next time I make it, I would add a little more matcha tea. The texture seems to be a bit more richer than what is served at a Japanese restaurant, but it still tastes good. I'm thinking of using 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups milk the next time, and instead of 6 eggs, I will use only 2 egg yolks instead.

Yuck! This is the worst green tea ice cream I have ever tried. Wish I would have read the reviews first.

I had read the reviews AFTER making this recipe for a Japanese dinner party, so I was a little panicked. I couldn't disagree with the reviews more. The dessert was creamy with the right hint of green tea. Green ice tea is not a sweet ice cream, and this recipe is not unlike the dessert served in many Japanese restaurants.

A better recipe would be to add matcha to taste to a vanilla ice cream.

I didn't have the powdered tea, so I steeped 6 green tea bags in the cream mixure and strained them out before chilling. Served with vanilla straw cookies. Nice looking presentation. Cool green color, rich yet refreshing end to a summertime meal. I'd do it again.

I fell in love with Green Tea ice cream when I lived in Japan. I was excited to try the recipe...this....whatever it really is... is *nothing* like what I fell in love with. It was awful.

I served this to a party of six with pretty good palates. The responses ranged from a polite "interesting" to "ghastly." No one was willing to try it again.
