This smelled so good while cooking but I agree with previous comments that it is bland. I added a lot more pepper and would add more next time. It is not flavorful enough as written. Also added chives and parsley.

Solid. Good. Easy. Kind of bland (and I don't typically cook with salt and I thought it was bland). Added more pepper, added salt n'at. I'd definitely make again.

i usually make a recipe just as written the first time, only i accidentally drained the beans and forgot to save the liquid. so, instead i subbed some homemade veggie stock. i also used a hot, smoked paprika which really lent a wonderful smoky aroma. i couldn't wait for leftovers the next day with the leftover garlic naan bread. sooo tasty!

Very popular at the recent party I brought this dish to, however, I would prefer it a bit spicier and would add extra garlic and cayenne next time. I served with a thin layer of oil, as it had the tendency to appear dried out, and sprinkled cumin on top for presentation. Served with carrots and toasted pita bread.

I´m afraid to use the liquid from the can. Other than that it is fine.

I enjoyed this as a nice alternative to hummus.

I prefer this over hummus. Using good Olive Oil makes a difference in this recipe. I usually add a nice squirt of lemon juice or smoked paprika depending on my mood.

Not exciting. I much prefer the taste of hummus. A chickpea dip is too heavy for me and bland without the zing of tahini or lemon. However, I don't want to scare anyone away if they want to try it, since my family liked it.

A sophisticated version of hummus. Nicer mouthfeel than hummus - silkier. I added a touch of smoked paprika and a little extra water (1/8 cup) to smooth it out a bit.
