As a wife that works a 12 hour day and then comes home and cooks dinner each night, this sauce is exactly what I need on nights like 'Wednesdays'. Something quick and easy, with great flavor. I start the sauce with no real thought to proportions - i just use the amount of garlic and onion I want for the meal. Once it's simmering, I set it to low and let it stay that way until my husband gets home - he usually works 16 hours days. We're able to eat a home cooked meal, spend time togther and enjoy a great pasta sauce before we fall into bed and do it all over again the next day:) - This isn't a fancy recipe - just a solid sauce that should be main stay of any home cooks repertoire.

This is a delicious, authentic, easy marinara sauce! You can certainly add to it as a starting base to suit your preferences, but it is great exactly as written. I ended up serving with a little fresh basil on top together with Chicken Marsala (also from epicurious). Dinner was a hit!

Fantistic! I used butter as I don't care for the taste of olive oil. The hint of butter in the sauce was yummy! Although this is so simple, I much prefer to jarred sauces. It's definitely in the rotation!

Followed this recipe to the letter using fresh tomatoes. However it is runny! I like the sause to sit on the pasta. Saved it by using a can of chopped tomatoes which thickened it and used a few leaves of fresh basil. I would not make this again as stated (only my way).

I used this for eggplant parmesan. I used canned no salt crushed tomatoes, doubled the garlic, added fresh from the garden oregano, parsley, and lots of basil, and added 1/2 cup of vermouth, and finally some red pepper flakes and additional black pepper. With all those additions, this was absolutely scrumptious, as was the eggplant parmesan.

Great basic sauce. Kids loved it. Agree with reviewer that suggests spicing it up after kids are fed.

I really didn't care for this at all. Very bland.

Solid, basic recipe. Let me suggest adding unsalted butter, not sugar, to cut the acidity if you find it to be an issue. You'll have to play it by ear for how much to add, usually going a tablespoon at a time will work. On another topic, simple additions to consider are bay leaves, cracked pepper, harbs such as oregano and parsley.

follow the advice of other respondees and halve the onion in this recipe. however, it was a great, simple marinara.

I am still learning how to cook, and I was very very happy to find this basic recipe. In my quest to eat foods without high fructose corn syrup, msg and other nasty things, I decided to try home made spaghetti sauce. This was so delicious! So much better than anything I've ever tried from a jar or can. And incredibly easy. I made it exactly as written. I thought 2 onions might be too much, but it was perfect! Next time I'll try to experiment--maybe mushrooms, and/or some italian seasonings.

This is exactly how I was taught to make a good basic "Starter" Sauce by my X's Italian grandmother, only I add more garlic. You can tweak it with other spices, fresh oregano, basil, parsley, red pepper flakes, etc. to your liking, I also add a couple of bay leaves to the onion saute and remove when the sauce is done.

Very tasty and simple. Added a few other herbs and spices to give a bit more flavour. Needed sugar added.

A good basic sauce,lots of flavour.I added about 1tsp.of Italin seasoning.My wife and I dont agree on sauces,she loved this,If I would have made this only for myself would have probably added some red wine and pameson cheese

I think this recipe is a great start. Add or increase with things you like. I think a little red pepper, fresh basil, and 1/4 cup of red wine are perfect.

We thought this was lovely, the flavor of the onions and garlic came through to make this delicious. I did have to add a bit of sugar to help balance the acid of the tomatoes. Seasoned generously with salt and pepper. Very nice and certainly simple.

Yummmmmm, simple and delicious. Doesn't need anything more than the basic spices of marinara...olive oil, onion, garlic. Excellent!

No basil? No oregano? But I do think it's good to publish basic recipes and to keep the basics simple. Still, if there's no basil or oregano, it's hard to imagine how one call it marinara.
