This recipe was OK. The meat on the outer leaves got kind of dried out and the bread crumbs landed halfway down the leaf - hard to get them and the meat in one bite. The heart was good, but I don't think I'll make this again.

Yum! So good. Used 2 giant globe artichokes and they worked out great. Loved the stuffing but the husband thinks next time I should used preserved lemons and I said I thought I'd add pine nuts. Also, I used olive oil over the top instead of butter because I was out!

Awesome. I grew up in Castroville, California ("Artichoke Capital of the World") and I didn't know they could be prepared this way! I know I'll come up with a hundred other ways to stuff and garnish artichokes based on this recipe.

My wife and I learned to cook artichokes like this while living in Rome (Carciofi a la Romano). If you find that taking the choke and inedible inner leaves out before steaming is difficult, let it cool and take it out after draining it but before stuffing it.

This was terrific. I added a cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese to the mixture and squeezed fresh lemon juice into the water bath. Both made for a more flavorful dish. We had large artichokes and they probably could have used another 10 minutes in the oven, but overall, it turned out great.

I'm puzzled that one reviewer thinks that removing the choke and trimming the artichoke prior to stuffing it takes too much effort. With a sharp knife trimming the artichoke becomes a simple task, and use of a melon baller facilitates removal of the choke, although a spoon works just fine, too. I like to use rosemary in place of or in addition to the oregano in this recipe and add a few tablespoons of parmesano to the stuffing. Try drizzling the artichokes with extra virgin olive oil in place of the butter. This is a delicious dish.

While I agree with the other reviewer that it's kind of a pain to remove the choke when the artichoke is raw, I still enjoyed making and eating this recipe very much. I would definitely make it again!

Why is every recipe I see for artichokes so complicated? Try this (I've been doing it for years with no complaints): DON'T "cut off half the artichoke and/or remove the choke" You don't need to. You simply peel off any brown leaves and rinse thoroughly. Then smash them open by banging them (topside first) on the counter. With the leaves opened, stuff them with garlic powder, grated cheese (whichever you like, we like pecorino), chopped parsley and flavored breadcrumbs. Then top this with a good olive oil and lots of salt and pepper (more than you would normally use). Then place the artichokes in a deep caserole or similar pan and fill three quarters of the way up with water. Cover and simmer on the stove top for about 1 1/2 hours, or until all leaves are tender. To eat: strip off the leaves and pull them against your clenched teeth - YUM! Bypass the choke and don't forget to eat the heart below.

The breadcrumb mixture in this recipe was tasty, but there was not enough of it to flavor all of the artichoke leaves. We resorted to our family favorite dipping sauce of mayo with Tabasco to augment the missing flavors. Additionally, removing the choke from an UNCOOKED artichoke was a lot harder than I imagined. There are better recipes out there.

I have just run across this recipe and am excited to make it, even moreso, after reading the other reviews. Artichokes are messy to eat by there very nature, however it's a great vegetable to get kids turned on to (perhaps because they are so messy?!?). We have always eaten them steamed, however this looks great. I was thrilled to see the hyperlink to the directions for preparing the Artichokes. Looks pretty simple. My experience in the past is to use Kitchen Shears vs. knives as it's easier to control the cuts and still keep my fingers. I will comment again after making the recipe to see if I'm still as enthused.

Artichokes are always a pain to prepare; but I loved this recipe and have already made it 3 times--because I love artichokes! It was worth the trouble and I didn't change a thing!

Good and messy. We usually eat steamed Artichokes so this was a nice change. Will make again. Will try decreasing the oil and increasing the lemon.

This dish was very messy to eat although it was tasty. The directions for how to prepare the artichokes were vague and confusing.
