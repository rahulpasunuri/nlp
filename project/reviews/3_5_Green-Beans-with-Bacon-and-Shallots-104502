This is one of those receipes that even people who don't like vegetables love! I make it every Thanksgiving upon request from my family. Easy to make and delicious

I have been making this receipe for several years now. It started out as avegetable for our now 28 member family Christmas Dinner gathering. It is now requested annually as my contribution to the meal. Every member of the family loves it from young to old. Many of them do not generally like green beans or for that matter vegetables. Much to my 16 yr old sons dismay he rarely gets to bring any left overs home. His Christmas dinner is often a heaping plate of the beans with a scrap of turkey.

I love bacon. I love butter. And I love green beans. But this was waaaay too greasy for me (I made it as written). I would suggest using only half the amount of bacon and using only 1 Tbsp. of butter or maybe none at all.

I followed some of the other reviews and did not add any butter. I used only the bacon fat. I also didn't have shallots so I used a vidalia onion instead. I also added 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper to add a kick. It was wonderful!

Easy, delicious way to eat beans. I just used the 3 T bacon driping/fat and omitted the butter. The beans had plenty of flavor. I would like to try this recipe with other green vegs like brussel sprouts or broccoli or even chard.

This is such a great recipe - I make it with turkey bacon to cut down on the fat & it's still delish. This Thanksgiving I made it as a side & it was devoured - no leftovers!!!

I made this dish for Christmas Eve dinner as a side for a Standing Rib Roast. Super easy to make and I was even able to get the 6 year old to help snap the beans. Everyone loved it. This is a great dish if you have a lot going on because you can make it in stages and ahead of time.

Very good. Made it with Christmas lamb. Excellent side dish and easy. I had the back ready the day before and it was fast to put together.

I halved this recipe and had to substitute yellow onion for the shallots. Took other reviewers great advice and lessened the grease. I quickly poured off all the bacon grease and added less than a tablespoon of butter. Sounds like an oxymoron, but wound up with a light tasting dish full bacon flavor.

Simple yet very delicious. I have made it several times and each time it gets compliments and it is eaten up. Great side for just about any type of meal.

I used Pancetta instead of bacon because I had it for my main course. These beans were delicious. I had 8 people for a dinner party and everyone raved!!!

Recipe big enough for 2 adults, only. No butter is necessary. 1 or 2 tbsp of bacon grease is necessary. I'll definitely cook it again.

This was okay. It was greasy, the butter is not needed. I would not make this again.

The best green beans I' ever eaten. Loved them!

This was a great recipe! I normally don't use bacon in my cooking, but it was essential to give the flavor to the beans. I used a low-fat bacon to try to cut down on fat. (another idea is to use turkey bacon). I took other reviewers advice on cutting down on the butter because it would make the beans too greasy, and even then I could have used less. The bacon fat was more than enough, and I took out more than what the recipe called for. I also added the juice of 1/2 a lime, and a few red pepper flakes. This gave it a great kick. My boyfriend wants me to make them again this week. This will become a favorite.

I like this because it makes it easier for my kid to eat them. Lotsa flavor in a little time. Most stores have fresh-cut beans year round now too, so why not?

This was a last minute side dish I made for dinner with friends and we all thought it was excellent. My friend made it the very next day for her dinner guests!

Rating: 3
WOW! I loved it! I tried it the way the recipe was written and it was great. Next time I think I will try leaving out some of the fat though, I can see how it would be a little too greasy. I liked it and I will do it again. The shallots were a great combo with the beans and bacon.

For those of you who thought this was too greasy. I liked this recipe but also thought it was a little on the greasy side too sooo... I cut the bacon fat to 1tb, thickened it up with about 1tb of flour and added a cup and a half of chicken broth,added the beans simmered until it got a little viscosity and there you go. I've also tried blanching as someone else suggested and also "stir frying" the beans with a little of the bacon grease, sesame oil works well too if you want to cut more fat, just use a little grease in the sauce, it gives good flavor. It's all good!!

This was wonderful! I only held back 2 TB of bacon grease so they wouldn't be too greasy. Everyone loved these green beans. A definite repeater.

THis is my 16 year old sons favorite holiday recipe. He inhales the green beans. It is a must for the Thanksgiving and Christmas table ( and so easy I should be making it more oftern!)

Dish was very easy to make, but overall not very tasty. There are much better bean dishes out there.

I made this with the beans a little too crisp and it didn't blend well with the other flavors until I reheated them the next day. Next time I will cook the beans a little more. Overall though, yum.

Served this for 16 people at Christmas dinner. Followed the recipe as written and it was fabulous. I cooked the bacon just long enough to render some fat out (didn't have to remove extra fat before sauteing) but enough to give just a hint of color. There's nothing better than the smell of bacom fat, butter and shallots cooking either. They were a big hit. Had only a tiny bit left.

This dish had a good flavor but was a little dry for my tastes. I added some chicken stock at the end and a little cornstarch to make a light sauce for the beans. THe little bits of crunchy bacon provided a nice contrast to the creamy shallots and crisp-tender beans. I would make this dish again.

Simple and really good. The second time I made it I added mushrooms when I sauteed the shallots. A Super Yum!

Oh my goodness!!! I've made this dish for my fiancee and I three times, and every time it just taste better and better. The shallots really add to the flavor. I have varried the boiling time of the green beans from 3 minutes (for a crisper bean) to 6 minutes (for a more tender bean) and right in the middle at 4.5 minutes. Each way tasted great, I guess it is just a personal preference. I recommend using butter, not margerine!!

Just a suggestion for those who found this recipe too greasy. I have made a similar recipe except I add a tiny amout (1-2 tsp) of wine vinegar at the end. It takes away the greasy feel and adds a nice dimension to the dish.

We made it three times over the holidays. Twice I used fresh, triple-washed spinach and made it in advance. With the spinach it was much faster as there was no preparation for the spinach. It looked it very elegant on the plate and our guests loved it. I micro-waved the bacon while sauteeing the shallots, then added the bacon fat to the pan. I added the bacon to the pan here also, which worked the first time but not the second time (see below). I then removed the pan from the burner and stirred the spinach (a bag and a half or more for twelve) in batches in the pan to cover it with the mixture. I packed it in a large glass bowl sprinkling each batch with salt, covered tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated it. Just before serving, I micro-waved it (still covered with the plastic and watching carefully so as not to shrink the spinach too much) for a couple of minutes. That's it! It was great to have so little mess and effort needed at serving time! [Adding the bacon before refrigerating worked the first time because I only refrigerated it for about an hour or less. The second time, I left it in the refrigerator several hours and the bacon got mushy. Next time, I'll leave it at room temperature until just before or just after micro-waving.]

Excellent flavor and so easy! I thought it had just the right amount of "grease" and the combination of bacon and caramelized shallots was just wonderful. I can't imagine why other reviewers thought this was too much trouble for weeknight - simply slice the shallots, cook the bacon and shallots, steam the green beans, mix it all together and POOF! You're done!

Rating: 3
We thought this recipe was a fantastic side dish for our family Christmas Eve dinner!! I used expensive pepper bacon and kept the green beans from getting too over-cooked--the crispier, the better! We received a lot of complements on this dish--but I agree that I would not make this for anything other than a special occasion, because it is kind of "putzy" for a vegetable dish. But try it, if it sounds good to you--because it will not disappoint!!

These were really good: I'm not much of a cook and prefer restaurants to anything home made, but I would order these. Pretty easy to make and wonderful flavors.

I too would cut down on the bacon fat used since they were a little greasy but thought the flavor was very nice. My husband and I finished them off (though I still couldn't convince my 2 year old to try them.) I would make them again as a change from plain buttered green beans.

Rating: 2
This was good, but I wasn't crazy about it. It seemed like more trouble than it was worth for just a weeknight dinner, better for a special occasion. I reduced the amount of bacon fat used. It still seemed a little greasy to me, though, since I'm used to hardly having anything on my beans, but since there were so many rave reviews I had to try it! My picky 6 yr. old ate it, and my husband thought it was very good -- bacon, they can't resist it!

Really enjoyed this way of cooking the beans. Did as much in advance and quickly finished off as the rest of the meal was ready. Will use this as a side dish often.

Rating: 4
WOW! OK, I admit, I usually dislike those folks who change a recipe, and then review it, and now I'm doing it! I took a large bag of frozen whole green beans and adjusted the amount of bacon to match, and used a chopped onion in place of the shallots (none in the house), but otherwise followed the recipe as written. My husband was eating them as I cooked, and I barely got them onto the platter! My seven year old ate three servings, and picked the serving platter clean. This is now a staple at our house. (I cooked the beans early in the day, and kept in the fridge) I had no problems with the greasiness mentioned by other reviewers, but my bacon didn't leave a lot of drippings (I used Oscar Meyer center cut), and I actually needed to add the butter to have enough to saute the beans in.

excellent, classic and still contemporary. virtually a do-ahead vegetable.

I agree with some of the other comments--the dish was a little too greasy and there wasn't as much flavor as I thought there would be because of the bacon. Good idea, but somehow when I made it the dish fell short.

I found this dish to be a bit too greasy. I would leave out the bacon fat altogether and use less butter. Also, I thought the bacon would add enough saltiness, but that wasn't the case. So, make sure to salt the water when boiling the beans.
