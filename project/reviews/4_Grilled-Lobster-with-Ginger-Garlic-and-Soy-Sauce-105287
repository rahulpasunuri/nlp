Outstanding flavours here. The name of this recipe doesn't really do it justice. It's reminiscent of Chinese style crab with ginger and green onion. We thought it was much more interesting than the usual drawn butter approach. Not persuaded about the menu combination here (Dinner under the Stars). I made it with asparagus in the citrus sauce and the Greek Salad and didn't think either particularly suited. I would serve it next time with some kind of oriental cold noodle salad. There's no point in hot accompaniments when you have a brilliant lobster on your plate: focus, focus, focus!

Amazing recipe, and very easy. I did modify the sauce a bit, adding about 3 T. butter and sauteing the garlic in that before adding it to the olive oil and ginger. Added a bit of sea salt and cracked pepper too. The lobsters were simple to boil, grilling went quick, I split them just in 1/2. Presentation was beautiful. Recommend for summer dinner on the patio with grilled asparagus topped by the same sauce as lobster. Served macerated strawberries and mascarpone cream as dessert. So good.

I used fresh lobster tails instead of live lobster and it turned out great. The sauce was a nice alternative to drawn butter. Everyone loved it

This is easy and fantastic. I wanted to try it out before using lobsters so I used the sauce on shrimp and cooked them in a wok. It was fantastic. Then I did the lobsters in a wok instead of on teh grill. The flavor is wonderful.

So good. Would make this again tomorrow, I added a dash of sriracha for a tiny bit of heat.

Have made this several times. Quick, easy and a nice option aside from drawn butter.

As others have said the sauce makes it. I agree with the suggestion to use low sodium soy - the sauce tends to the really salty side. Would also try the sauce on fish and scallops.

This dish is awesome. The only change is use low sodium soy sauce, just a bit salty and don't add salt. Otherwise great flavors. I purchased lobster tail in the shell, removed them and cut them in half. BBq'd them for 2-3 min per side. Came out great. Everyone loved them and said we need to do these again.

Absolutely, positively awesome. So delicious and easy to make. If you don't have the heart to use live lobsters, lobster tails work just as well and really cut down on the time for the recipe. Just cut them in half and jump right to the grilling part - serve on top of soba salad for a truly amazing presentation!

Made this New Year's Eve. The marinade/sauce is very tasty and easy. Do not use as much olive oil as stated. I will use half next time.

Used frozen lobster tails and they worked just great. The sauce is fabulous and I got raves from everyone at my dinner party. Making again today with prawns.

We made this last night and thought it was delicious. Used 1 1/2 lb lobsters and grilled them for 6 minutes (10 is too long). EXCELLENT!

A great recipe. 1 1/2 cups olive oil was way too much, however. Could easily be reduced by half. We had the lobsters steamed and split at the store, which made the recipe even easier.

Nice change from the regular boiled lobster. A Father's Day hit with all the family.

I e-mailed this recipe to my husband some months ago and since then he has made this dish twice and on both occassions we thoroughly enjoyed the end result. The tangy sauce perfectly complemented the lobster. We are having friends over tonight and we plan to make this dish again. In one word this recipe is "devine".

This was a huge hit at my fall fest barbecue.

This was an especially easy recipe to make. My guests raved about the meal and I was happy with the results. It looked as though I had been in the kitchen for hours. Will continue making this dish!

very good lobster and made it when my mom came over she said it was one of the best she had ever tried

This sauce is spectacular on any meats: as other cooks mention, try it with chicken breasts, pork satays, and any fish fillet. Disagree with the need for fresh live lobster to be boiled to death. With the intense thai-flavored ingredients plus grilling the lobster tails offer less work and less pain - try them!

We've made this three times now and it still wows us. Maine lobsters are going through their soft shell phase right now, which can effect their texture, so I'll stick to frozen tails until they harden up. I'm marinating chicken kabobs in the ginger soy sauce for a cookout this afternoon. Yum!

Great and easy recipe. One suggestion I might make is to remove the claws and cook them for only half as long as the lobsters, since they were a little overcooked. But, overall excellent!
