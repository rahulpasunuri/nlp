This was really a great way to utilize the whole duck and, picking up my peking duck in china town, there are many extra parts to throw into the stock. The stock was wonderful and I was able to render out plenty of fat for potatoes later. The duck was well cooked and I appreciate the hosting-friendly approach to this recipe in that it is economical, forgoes the traditional display and cutting for an easier yet still lovely display, and gives a little wiggle room for finishing time with a final reheat of the duck pieces in the oven. The reason this is not a four fork for me is that I found the sauce to be too light and lacking a good punch to stand up to the meaty duck. I think next time I may use more port and orange juice, or zest, just something to bring up the flavor a little. I did shave down the very orange edge of some orange rind to add into the sauce at the end for a little boost, but it was still not quite enough. Over, worth revisiting, and a great to to get the most out of a whole duck.
