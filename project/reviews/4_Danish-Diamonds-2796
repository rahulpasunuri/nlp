We make these every year too. Our original Danish recipe calls for frying in lard. Health issues aside, they really taste better!

my family has made this recipe for years,with a slight variation. only egg yolks are used and the whipping cream is whipped and folded in. also it is a larger recipe,but these are a family favorite from norway called fattigman.
