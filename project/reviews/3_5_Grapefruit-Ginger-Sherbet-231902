This is a delightful, light and tangy dessert sorbet/ice cream. I disagree that the ginger overpowers the grapefruit; in my hands, the amounts were perfect. I cut down slightly on the sugar and didn't have any problems. I also added in a little bit of ginger preserves at the end; this provided occasional bites of sweet stem ginger in the sherbet for an extra treat! Served with gingersnaps and ginger shortbread. Enjoyed by all, but it is true that this is an "adult" taste.

This makes a refreshing and very grown up dessert. It's not at all sweet and not for children, unless they have quite sophisticated tastes. The next time I make this, I will cut the amount of ginger in half; as is, the ginger flavor overwhelms that of the grapefruit. Also, it takes forever to grate all that the ginger, so using less will be better all around.

This is an excellent sorbet- fresh, tangy, citrusy. I love anything with pink grapefruit, and this is a refreshing and different way to serve it.
