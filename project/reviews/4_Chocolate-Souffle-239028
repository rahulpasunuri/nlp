I am a very, very novice cook, and I decided to make a souffle mostly as a culinary challenge. To my surprise, this recipe was quite easy! I didn't have any bittersweet chocolate, so I used very dark (73%) instead and these came out HEAVENLY. Not too sweet at all, and the powdered sugar is such a nice touch. I was pretty impressed with this recipe, and my boyfriend was pretty impressed with my cooking ;) Will definitely make again for company and special occasions.
