I doubled the curry powder in the filling. Used filet of salmon, baby shrimp and bitesize scallops since in the northwest, scrod is unavailable. next time I would half the amount of peas- too many - too much color 1 Tablespoon of hot and spicey mango chutney and and loved the lemon for contast of flavors! then the next day put the leftovers in an omelette. YUMMMMMY! Would be a great on the menu for a dinner party.

Thought the crepes were tasty and will be used again. Filling was okay, but not incredible. The whole dish tasted the same, no balance to make flavours pop.

The curry taste is overwhelming. next time I make this recipe, I will not add curry powder to the crepes.
