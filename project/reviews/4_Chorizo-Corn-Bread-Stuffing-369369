This was delicious. I used spelt flour and honey for the cornbread. My 4 year old made the cornbread pretty much on her own (super simple recipe!) and then I did the rest. It was easy and a bit unusual and everyone loved it.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! I was concerned about the corn bread because it was stiff and had to be flattened rather than poured into the 8" pan, but it turned out fine. Will definitely make again and again!
