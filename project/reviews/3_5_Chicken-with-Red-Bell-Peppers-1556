This is one of the most flavorless recipes I've ever made. I added more garlic and some rosemary and that didn't help. I'll never make it againl

Fntastic. I made a few minor changes to the recipe (which I usually feel is cheating when you are rating a recipe) but since they are minor I feel as I did not compromise the orginal recipe. Here are the changes. I cut the breasts into large "chunks" and then sauteed. When I boiled the peppers to make the sauce I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. I served it over Orzo and topped it with crumbled Feta Cheese...not parsley.

Just made this for dinner with 50% more of all ingredients (i.e., 3 Tbsp butter, 3 garlic, 1 1/2 cups of broth)...and it was delicious! Didn't have chicken broth so used beef and didn't have parsley. Added the onions as other reviewers suggested. The extra ingredients did give it more sauce as another reviewer suggested, and it was great! Would prefer the peppers a bit more crisp than mushy, but the taste was amazing!

My family LOVED this! I used the package of three tri-color bell peppers from Trader Joe's (red, orange and yellow) and, per the other reviews, added thinly sliced red onion. I cooked the peppers and onion low-and-slow for about an hour or so. I think I'd double the peppers/onions next time because they were devoured quickly. Really, really good.

This was good, not great or unusually delicious but definitely worth making. The boyfriend thought it was weird at first but the flavor grew on him and he liked it by the end. He said it was too much like chicken fajitas without the fajitas. Flavor was good and I will probably make it again, but won't be reaching for it. Served with roasted fingerlings and a salad.

I added some curry to the chicken and red pepper flakes as some had suggested as well as shallots and increased to 5 cloves of garlic....well, I couldn't taste the red bell peppers anymore, even though I liked it a lot! Tasted like a spicy chicken curry, not that that is a bad thing. Next time I will try to follow the recipe more closely or add less curry. Altogether will definitely make this again with a few changes.

This was very good - and incredibly easy, especially since I had half a bell pepper nearly rotting in the fridge. Sauteed the sliced pepper with a bit of onion and garlic for ~10 minutes, then followed the recipe. Might slightly increase the white wine. A tasty, basic dish if you're pressed for time.

Oops, one more change: I used one red pepper and one yellow, for more color. Very yummy and easy.

With only two modifications, this is a 4-forker: (1) I added thinly sliced red onion to the peppers and sauteed on very low heat for about an hour, which makes them silky and more delicious, and (2) instead of breasts, I used thighs because they are juicier and don't dry out. Served this dish over polenta. Wow! Next time, I might add a splash of balsamic vinegar.

Before making this meal, I read a lot of the other reviews and suggestions. By adding more garlic, red pepper flakes, an habanero pepper and some curry on the chicken, this dish was extremely flavourful and delicious! Thank you for the great suggestions!! Awesome meal! Definitely an encore!

My husband thought this was great! I only had green bell peppers so I threw in some seeded chopped tomatoes for color. I also skipped the flour and thickend the sauce with corn starch instead and added extra garlic on the advice of other reviewers. Overall it was good and I will make it again.

Easy to make, and downright delicious. The chicken was tender and the flavor was spectacular. It was a good choice for feeding lots of people, and it went over very well at my party.

Thi dish is really bland unless you doctor it up with more herbs. just tastes like chicken cooked in broth with some peppers. I'd recommend adding more garlic, some other herbs like red pepper flakes and thyme, and skipping the flour. More broth too if you actually want some sauce (the broth cooks off and the sauce is minimal)

I made this early in the day today so I only had to cook noodles and nuke the chicken and sauce at suppertime. (The mercury was supposed to hit 100 degrees.) Done this way the kitchen stayed cooler than 80 degrees at 6 PM!! Since I was cooking for 2, I only used 2 breast halves, 1 orange and 1/2 red bell pepper, but I did make the amount of sauce written for 4 servings. Increased the garlic to 5 cloves, sprinkled the raw chicken with curry powder, added 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, and thickened the sauce with flour/water (all are suggestions by reviewers--Thanks to all of you). I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar at the very end to give it a bit more zing. LOVED the sauce over noodles. VERY, VERY YUMMY. Will definitely make this many times!!! I couldn't really tell that the flavor of the bell peppers infused into the chicken, but the sauce was SO excellent, who cares???

Excellent Recipe once you add a little extra flour and red pepper flakes. I will be making again and again. Next time, I will make some orzo or rice to go with the great sauce.

I made this for two people, I only halved the red pepper and chicken, so I ended up with lots of yummy sauce. I also added some dried crushed red pepper and habeneros for some kick. I will definitely make it again.

I think this dish was great. I also added flour to the sauce to thicken it up. I used about 6 cloves of garlic along with red pepper flakes. I would recommend halving the chicken breasts to cut down on cooking time. Over all this was great. I got about 20 "this is so good" comments during dinner.

Sauce was a bit thin. I added a small amount of flour and red pepper flakes to thicken it up and add a bite. Next time, I'll make more sauce and add mushrooms. It was delicions

This is one of my favorites, and I use red pepper oil instead of just plain olive oil to give it a little kick!

Bland, boring. I cooked peppers very slowly as suggested, increased garlic and added red onion. The sauce didn't thicken so I added flour. I didn't cook the peppers in the sauce as long as suggested b/c it seemed like they would get soggy. At the table, I sprinkled with red pepper flakes which saved this from total blandness. Maybe our tastes are just spicier than this recipe can hold up to. Not a keeper.

A very easy and tasty way to enjoy chicken. The recipe is fine just as it stands. I serve mine with brown rice. PERFECT!!!

Rating: 3
This dish is suprisingly good, I was not expecting so much flavor with such little ingredients! The trick is to cook the peppers pretty slowly, this will add a lot of flavor! I doubled the sauce and mixed 1 1/2 cups cooked rice to the dish, it was pretty good!!

Rating: 3
I would recommend doubling the sauce.

This has become a midweek regular for me. I usually do a mix of red and yellow peppers...cook very slowly. I also add the garlic in the last 2-3 minutes of the peppers cooking...i find if the garlic cooks to long, it burns. Usually double the recipe...leftovers are even more yummy.

Rating: 3
This is so quick and easy for a week night recipe and the flavor is excellent. Double the sauce if you want to pour it over rice. I also cooked the pepper a bit less - 5-6 minutes.

What a great recipe! I was very pleasantly surprised. I upped the garlic and thickened the sauce with a little bit of potato starch. -- My three year old son loved every bite!

Good, easy too. I added onion to the recipe, and my husband and son agree that the dish might withstand a bit more garlic. Very tasty!

This was a very easy receipe and I would make it again. Next time, I would add a touch of flour because I didn't think the sauce was thick enough. My husband and I both really enjoyed it.

This is a grrreat easy sauce. I made the sauce by itself to serve with what i thought looked like a more interesting chicken recipe on this site: bread crumb coated chicken. The two together were superb. Separately they each get 3 forks, together they get 4.

Great recipe! Simple ingredients, easy to make, and tastes wonderful. I've always received nice compliments when ever I've served it.

Honestly, I would not have made this recipe because I never really cared for bell peppers. However, my husband made this dish for dinner one night and I was impressed. It's absolutely incredible.

This is a great dish with few ingredients. I have made it 5 times..My family loves it. Friends have asked me for the recipe. Double the sauce and add a small amount of flour to thicken.I split boneless chicken breasts in have so they were very thin....

Easy recipe. I also found the sauce to be skimpy, I've doubled it & it worked out well. Colorful dish. I used cilantro instead of parsley which added a nice touch.

Easy, tasty, and reasonable fast. Also simple to do when cooking for only 2 people.

The taste was good but there was not enough sauce if the dish is served over rice. I would only rate the recipe a B-, pretty good but not great.

I am not a big fan of red peppers so I was reluctant to try this one out. However, I was very pleasantly surprised how good it turned out. I would definitely make this recipe again!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. The chicken came out very tender and juicy, and the red bell peppers added a nice flavor. I used 4 cloves of garlic, which was just right, not to strong. What I loved most about this recipe though was that it did not call for too many ingredients.

Rating: 3
This was really very tasty. We liked the way the flavor of the red peppers seeped its way into the chicken -- it could have been bland, but wasn't. Like many, I added more garlic. After all, why not?

Rating: 3
My family loved it. I increased the amount of garlic as others have done but I only partly cooked the chicken (in the sauce) the day before and then placed it in the fridge overnight and completed the cooking process the following evening. The red pepper flavour was throughout the meat. Lots of compliments on the dish.

Rating: 4
Delicious and simple to make. My husband really loved this one. Being a garlic fiend, I added 6 cloves, which works for me! Served with a wild and brown rice pilaf, this made a very nice presentation. I will make this again.

I sauteed the peppers (red and yellow) and garlic for 5 minutes, max! Don't want those peppers to get soft. If you want to "Kick it up a notch", add more garlic (I used 5 cloves) and sprinkle the chicken with curry powder before adding to fry pan. Adds a wonderful punch to the dish! I would make thi sagain for sure!

I liked it well enough but my husband didn't care for it. If I made it again I'd add onions to add more zip and I wouldn't cook the peppers so long in the beginning. They were a little too soft.

Rating: 4
I added about 1/4 cup of half and half to the sauce. I also originally sauteed mushrooms and sweet onion with the red pepper and garlic (more than 2 cloves!).

Wonderful! Tasty, easy and very pretty. I used sherry instead of white wine, because that is what I had.

I loved this recipie. The basic recipie for the sauce, has been a great help. I've made a similar sauce with veinison and mushrooms, just by changing the type of broth and wine. This has been a hit every time

Very good recipe. Nice flavor. The chicken and red bell peppers go well together.

Rating: 2
Not a bad recipe, but next time I'd use only half the fat, and only 3/4 cups of chicken stock. I didn't saute the peppers at the beginning, and I'm glad I eliminated this step - they were soft enough by the time the stock, etc had reduced.
