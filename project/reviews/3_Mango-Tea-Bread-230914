what a waste of a perfectly good mango or two! No taste of mango in the bread at all. Still an okay recipe. I don't think I will make it again though.

Not crazy about this recipe, the crumb is very heavy and the bread dense. I think there are probably better versions, though the reader suggestion of soaking the raisins in peach schnapps was a good one, and helped to emphasize the mango flavor. I used cardamom instead of the mix of spices.

My daughter shared this recipe with me and I have been making this mango bread for over 3 years. I use frozen mango in the off season. Soaking the 'golden'raisins in "peach schnapps" adds flavor. I always add pecans or walnuts, and I also reduce the sugar. We enjoy it with cream cheese - and I even toast it on occasion.

This recipe is great! I have made it twice since I have a mango tree in my backyard and lots of mangos! The second time I took out the cinnamon and nutmeg and added orange rind and a little bit of orange marmalade and substituted triple sec for brandy and dried apricots for the raisins. Very good!

If you are expecting a mango flavor, well... you will be disappointed. Nevertheless, this recipe is very good. Some suggestions: a)use 1/2C raisins and 1/2C candied ginger b) 1/4C gold rhum instead of brandy c) 1/2t cinnamon instead of 1t d)1C dark brown sugar instead of 1 1/4 regular sugar. Enjoy !

This was a very moist cake. I would reduce sugar as it was a little sweet for my taste. I agree not to magoey tasting, but none the less nice

This is a qualified review, because I used this recipe as written EXCEPT I replaced the mango with 1 cup pureed hachiya persimmon. The flavors complement persimmons wonderfully, and it makes a great seasonal bread for the fall months. I used grapeseed oil in place of butter for reasons of health, and it was moist and delicious.

I used pisco instead of brandy, and brown sugar. The color and aroma of this bread are superb. i agree that it doesn't really taste like mango, but that characteristic turned out to be advantageous, as my young nieces do not like mangoes, but loved the bread, served warm with chocolate ice cream.

I also was expecting a more fruity, tropical flavor. Wonder if omitting the cinnamon and adding some candied ginger would boost the mango flavor. The dominant flavor seemed to be cinnamon. Good texture.

I agree that a distinct brandy / mango taste is not specifically discernable . . but overall . . a good quick bread . .which I enjoyed cold with cream cheese . .I know . .overkill. .

This bread smelled really good while it was baking and cooling, but I really can't discern any mango flavor (and that's using 1 1/4 c ripe mango puree and 1/2 stick butter). Surprisingly, I also can't taste that the raisins were soaked in the brandy. This bread does slice beautifully, and it is good toasted w/ cream cheese.

not bad but nothing special

I didn't peel the mango, and I don't think anyone could possibly notice. This was my first bread recipe, and it was very easy. I also used the brandy, but I'm not sure to what effect. Maybe next time I'll skip it to see if I have lost anything. Overall, I think I'd just as soon have my wife's zuchinni (sp) bread over this, but this is nice recipe to have if one happens to have a mango sitting around. Oh! By the way, the recipe called for 2 mangos and to reserve any excess beyond 1 cup, but I found that my 1 mango had about 1.5 cups of puree so don't bother doing 2 unless you know you have smallish fruit.

I give this 3 1/2 forks. To make this a bit healthier, I substituted 1/2 of the butter with applesauce, and I used just 1 egg plus 4 egg whites. I doubt the recipe suffered from it- it was very moist and delicious

I used canned mangoes and omitted the raisins and it is fabulous! I wouldn't try it in a bread machine--it's too delicate.

Gabrielle in Las Cruces: this is a quick bread like muffins rather than a yeast bread. I've never used a bread machine but if you wouldn't make muffins or a cake in it, I wouldn't make this bread in it. There is no rising stage(as you probably noticed) so it's actually pretty quick to mix in a bowl & pour in the pan.

The liquor-soaked raisins are a wonderful addition to this moist and tasty bread. Definitely a keeper.

This is so moist - I cheated a bit and used canned mango pulp though - it was much easier. I cut down the baking time by 15 minutes and I'll definitely make again.
