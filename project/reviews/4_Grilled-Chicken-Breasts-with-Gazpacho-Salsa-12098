I made this last night to try it out before serving it to guests. It was delicious. The only thing that I did differently was added chopped avocado to the salsa. This recipe is a keeper.

A nice, refreshing, summer recipe. I doubled the gazpacho and used the rest for chips. I liked that I had plain grilled chicken for my picky son, then a mild, fresh gazpacho to put over the chicken for the rest of us, then we added more hot sauce to the leftover gazpacho to eat with chips. Very versatile.

other than all the chopping, a very easy recipe to put together. i substituted one matzo sheet for the bread to make it passover-friendly, but the salsa still turned out great. very light and yummy. i didn't exactly measure all the vegetables while making the salsa, and ended up with enough to top two chicken breasts, with two more servings of salsa for the fridge.

DELISH!!!!! Easy, fresh, healthy, perfect for a dinner party. Make extra salsa/gazpacho. It's yummy on corn chips the next day.

the red wine adds a great kick to the salsa. I mixed the extra salsa with mixed greens and it was very filling. It gets four forks because of the ease, freshness and delicious flavor.

This is quick, easy and delicious! I added an extra tomato and a bit more cucumber to make more salsa.

This recipe is fantastic. Easy to make for one or for a big group. Very fresh summery taste. Goes well on chicken, fish, or as a dip for tortilla chips. This one is a summer staple for me.

Excellent recipe to help me stay on my new year's diet. The salsa was fresh tasting and a great accompaniment to the grilled chicken. I'm going to try it with broiled salmon too.

Scrumptious and easy. I looooove the gazpacho - it's hard not to eat it while I'm waiting for the chicken to cook...

Made this for a VIP buffet with corn pudding and the Watercress and Melon Salad with almonds (recipes also on site) for a luncheon today and it was a huge homerun... In the Vegas heat, I love keeping things fresh, seasonal and most of all flavorful but light -- this was really delicious.

This was great! My boyfriend is Spanish and said "this is Gazpacho"! Even though they usually drink it as a nice refreshing summer drink, the taste was the same. Since he hates cucumbers, I left them out and just added more tomatoes, onions, and peppers. Also, I marinated the chicken in lemon for about an hour. All in all it was just great!

GREAT!! I am always looking for new recipes to use the fresh tomatoes from my garden and this was well worth it. It was also easy and QUICK! The flavors were great together and I also used fresh hot peppers instead of tabasco. Enjoy!

Made the salsa last night and it was a huge hit. Probably the favorite out of the four salsas I served with grilled chicken that I had brined.

Refreshing and tangy! I loved the creamy part to this different take on gazpacho. It goes perfectly well with simple grilled chicken and toasted baguette slices drizzled with olive oil. Great summer dish

oh heavens, is this divine! so delish! i should add that i substituted 2 things: jalapeno for tabasco and vidalia onion for the red. i was slightly turned off at first for the color the bread turned the initial tomato mixture, but this is definitely the absolute best salsa i have ever made / ate! i served it with chicken roasted with lots of slivered onion and used the pan juices to flavor toasted orzo - what an easy, healthy and delicious dinner - everyone loved it!

We have used this recipe countless times and it's always terrific. We use a jalapeno pepper instead of the Tabasco when we have one from the garden - and you can even use canned plum tomatoes in a pinch.

Fast, easy, fantastic summer recipe. The only thing I do differently is use multi-grain bread. Yummy.

What a great way of taking ordinary chicken and turning it into a wonderful meal. The gazpacho salsa is bursting with flavor. I made the salsa as described, but marinated my chicken in some bottled Italian dressing just to keep it juicy when grilling. The liquid part of the gazpacho (before adding the chunky ingredients) would probably make a great marinade, as well. Definitely a keeper!

Wow.. we've been looking for the chicken recipe to knock our socks off for some time and this was it. Great spring/summer dish. The salsa is great!! Only change was to add a bit of sugar as other's suggesed. Delicious.

Really really good. Great to make ahead. I made the salsa in the afternoon and the flavors really came together with the extra time. I did add a little sugar to the salsa. Yum. I didn't want the chicken to done on the grill so I baked it in chicken broth for 20 min. before it hit the grill. Made a corn pilaf as a side with tortillas.

Delicious and quick. I served it with torillas I warmed on the grill -- it was great. I will definitely make this again.

We doubled the recipe so spent a good bit of time chopping, but it was worth very minute. We're going to try the salsa on fish tacos next time

Fantastic salsa! This turned a regular old grilled chicken breast into a taste sensation!

Yum! A good meal for a warm spring night. This salsa has a nice flavor. Next time I might throw in a jalapeno when I'm blending the dressing for an added kick. I also added diced avocado, and it turned out great!

I've made this often for a crowd to great success. It's a bit grander than it seems. I serve it with some sauce spooned over the sliced chicken, then garnished with ripe, sliced avocado.

I love this recipe! It was so quick and easy. I made it on a warm day in Seattle, and it hit the spot. We love garlic so I added an extra clove. I can't wait to make it for company.

A recipe that both my husband and I enjoyed. It was simple to make and we had several of the ingredients growing in our garden. I believe the freshness of the ingredients added to the intensity of the flavors. I think this sauce would be delicious with a white fish such as halibut as well.

This dish was good, but on reading the recipe I thought the chicken would be a bit bland, especially since I was cooking it in a grill oven, and not over hot coals. To the chicken recipe I added oregano and ground coriander. I decided not to cover the chicken as specified but this made it a bit dry -- it had a more barbecued texture. For the Gazpacho, I used red wine and brown vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I used coriander instead of parsley. I used lots of roma tomatoes, removed the crust from the bread, and used seeded green capsicum as well as green ball peppers, removing most of their seeds. I prepared the dish for five people, and it took about two hours. They loved it!
