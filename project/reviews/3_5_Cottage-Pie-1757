Loved it. Added a little grated cheese and grilled as opposed to naked baking.

Though this was okay, I will not be making it again.

De-licious. I didn't have mushrooms, gravy, or marjoram. I used beef broth, oregano, and added peas. I don't know if gravy would have made it more delicious. I might add tomato paste next time. My neighbor made us cottage pie after we had our baby and it was excellent and it had something tomato in it.

This was so good I couldn't stop eating it and I wanted some for lunch tomorrow. I did use ground buffalo meat, which is much leaner so I added a little chicken fat in place of the gravy. And green onions on top. Can't wait to make it again!

Perfect for this cold, rainy day in San Francisco. I made the gravy from scratch and it was much better than the first time I made it using canned gravy. I also put milk/cream/butter in the potatoes and herbs de provence for some added flavor.

This is a good basic recipe to start with and add you're own personal flair. I omitted mushrooms and carrots, added celery and more onion. I didn't have canned beef gravy and instead used a piece of Rachel Ray's sheperd's pie recipe which calls to make beef gravy with 1 cup beef broth, two tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp flour. I also added grated sharp cheddar after the potatoes had browned in the oven.

My husband and I just love this recipe - we make it quite frequently. The only change I made is to par boil the carrots to soften them up a bit and I use the whole can of beef gravy. Just yummy.

This is great comfort food. I added a pinch of thyme and rosemary as extra spices for the meat and a little milk to the mashed potatoes, but otherwise I made it as written. Serve this with peas on a cold winter's night and you're all set!

It was good overall, needs more spices.

I made this recipe with mushrooms and onions, but no carrots and shared the meal as a dish at a Scottish family gathering. Everyone enjoyed it. I will make this again.

No one mentioned the juices spilling over onto the oven. Just an FYI to put something underneath the pan. Otherwise, it looks delish! I added a half a bag of veggies to it

We had some leftover mashed potatoes and I love cottage and shephards pie, so thought I'd give this a try. It was fine, but nothing special. The carrots don't soften up enough given how late in the recipe they are added and it seemed a bit heavy on the parsley. Next time I'm in the mood for good cottage pie, I'll probably just go to the Irish pub down the street and eat theirs.

Outstanding dish. We added more milk for the smashed potatoes. Other than that, the recipe was top notch.

I brought this to a British-themed party and it was a hit.

Not a very 'pretty' dish to look at, but absolutely the best in the comfort food category. The only thing I changed was to add some milk to the mashed potatoes as they seemed too dry to me. For me, this is a keeper.

Of many shepherd's pie types of recipes tried, this one is the best. I save homemade gravies from Sunday dinners (turkey, chicken, beef), freeze them, and use in this recipe rather than canned gravy. Hearty!

Reminds me of the cottage pie I used to get at the Chequers pub in Mildenahll, England. After baking, I top with shredded cheddar cheese and put it back in the oven til melted. Good old fashioned comfort food!

I grew up with a close variation of this recipe and it's one of my comfort foods now. I chop my carrot into a small dice instead of slicing it. I also add one diced parsnip, which adds pure lovliness to this dish. Chopping all the vegetables gives this a more compact texture, very much like the meat pasties I grew up with. For a gravy, I make up a gravy using Lipton's Beef Onion Soup mix (the boxed variety). I also like adding a tablespoon of Merlot to the gravy.

This was very good! I made it tonight and used ground turkey/turkey gravy and it turned out delicious!

My fiance was HORRIFIED when he heard I was going to make Cottage Pie! Apparently his mom used to make it and it was very very bland to him. He told me I had ONE shot at making it! Well, mid-way though the dish, he told me I could make it again! We both enjoyed it very much and it was even better the next day. I forgot the Worchestershire sauce, mashed some roasted garlic into the potatoes, sprinkled cheese on top and it still turned out great!

Being on a low carb diet I just slightly switched it up and it was still absolutly delicious. I took out the carrot all togethor. Made mashed cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes, and used soy flour instead of regular flour. I absolutly loved this dish. It is my comfort food without having to feel to guilty.

A definite keeper! I generally double it and freeze one. I too add frozen peas to it, omit the mushrooms and double the carrots. This is comfort food and fairly quick to prepare.

Wonderful, hearty comfort dish. I've made this several times for my family and the only modification I've made is to add more garlic, more parsley and more mushrooms. My family is only 3 people but I always have to adjust the recipe UP because this dish is so well-loved, there simply isn't enough! Definately worth trying.

Like the other cooks, I substituted and changed. Left out the musrooms and parlesy and carrot but was creative with the spices and used beef bouillon instead of the gravy. It was good!

Very glad to see this recipe correctly named for a change (it is often mistakenly called Shepherd's Pie, which in fact is identical, except that it calls for lamb). Cottage pie is a tradition among British cooks for using up leftover roast beef and we normally use the leftover gravy from the roast. It there is not enough, add some flour and beef stock. Grind the left over beef in a mincer or food processor. To the cook from New Hampshire who denigrated British cooking, I would point out much of American cooking had it's origins in recipes from the UK. Try Delia Smith's website for some superb online recipes featuring British cuisine.

This is a great, easy, last minute type dinner. I usually make it a bit different each time. Tonight is the first time I am trying it with canned gravy (which I never buy) & it tastes great. I normally dissolve some cubes of Oxo and add cornstartch. Try adding some different cheeses or sour cream to the potatoes for a twist.

My hubby is a brit and misses his "pub" food. We make this whenever he hankers for something English. We use his favorite Bista gravy mix that his mother used. I usually use extra mushrooms and sometimes add some Boddington's Ale.

I made this for the second time and it was better. More garlic, more fresh parsley, and more black pepper. Definitely use a whole can of gravy and at least a 1/2 cup of tomato sauce for taste and texture. Red wine would be great when cooking the mushrooms. Make sure that the carrots are softened before putting the mixture in the oven, as they don't really cook any more in the oven.

Rating: 3
Yum. This was great, and so easy. I pretty much followed the recipe, but substituted 1 teaspoon of sage for the marjoram (didn't have it) and added a little extra garlic. The fresh parsley is a must, I think-- it adds a wonderful flavor. This makes for a satisfying, very quick dinner-- comfort food that's perfect for a cold, rainy autumn night.

This is a satisfying "stick to your ribs" kind of entree. My husband loves it and it is easy to throw together. I sprinkle some cheddar cheese over the top when I serve it.

I made this recipe last night. Rather than using ground beef, I used leftover meatloaf and vegetables from the Classic Meat Loaf and Roasted Vegetables recipe on this site. Not true to the original recipe, I know, but excellent! The roasted carrots, onions, as well as potatoes (which I used for the mashed potato topping) added great flavor!

Did not use the gravy sauteed mushrooms then added beef broth and a little flour to thicken. Turned out just fine!

I have to say that I did improvise quite a bit with this recipe but it was great. I am not a lover of a meat dish like this but hubby is. I also am not a mashed potato fan...strange, huh? I didn't have mushrooms, carrots or the parsely so that was left out. I also make my own gravy so there were no cans in this house. I did use bullion cubes diluted in water. I then thickened it with cornstarch and a bit of water instead of adding the flour. I used all the other igredients. I made the mashed potatoes and added some fresh grated parmesean cheese. The fridge was bare so I used what I had. Since everything was made for the dish I broiled it on high until the potatoes got nice and brown. This dish was a hit with my husband. I would make it basically the same way next time but add the mushrooms. I also might try a cheddar cheese in the potatoes.

For a dish that originated in England it's actually quite tasty, but the gravy is a must. I tried using some tomato soup instead, as suggested, and it just wasn't right.

We love this recipe. I have made it several times. It is a great winter meal - simple and easy to prepare. My husband loves it as does my finicky granddaughter.I use milk and butter in preparing the potatoes and use a whole can of beef gravy. I have also used 1/2 lean ground beef and 1/2 ground lamb. It is delicious and leftovers are just as wonderful (and don't stay in the refrigerator long).

Rating: 3
Very authentic to that served in England! I used a can of mixed vegetables as I didn't have carrot alone. Thought it could use a bit of zip to it, so I added some capers. And the suggestion to add some shredded cheddar to the potatoes was a good one. Very tasty and quite open to variations.

Rating: 3
We really enjoyed this. Didn't have any beef gravy so I threw in some leftover spaghetti sauce! I added corn and left out the mushrooms. It turned out great. Will definately make it again, and would like to try it with the beef gravy next time. This recipe would also be good with ground lamb making it a Shepherd's Pie.

I made this recipe last night and my husband loved it. I didn't have beef gravy handy so I made a tomatoe sauce instead. It worked well. The addition of a layer of corn between the potatoes and meat was a great idea!

We liked this recipe a lot, it was very easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand. I had some frozen gravy that I used instead of the gravy in the jar, and I added milk and butter to the mashed potatoes. I also added chopped chives, since I had them anyway. Very tasty and I will definitely make again.

This has become a family favorite. I also follow the recipe to the tee except for adding milk and salt to the mashed potatoes and a layer of corn between the meat and the potatoes. Great for winter evenings.

Excellent way to use up leftovers: any kind of meat (steak, roast, etc); I like to add a can of corn or peas and a few extra carrots. A great one dish meal! (although we do like some rolls with it, too)

As a Brit living in the US, I agree with another reviewer that this is a very basic recipe.When I was a child everyone's mother had their own version.From memory,here are some variations I recall.Sliced tomatoes and grated cheddar cheese on top of the mash,sage and thyme as additional herbs,add bacon and/or baked beans to the meat,which can be lamb or beef,fresh or leftovers from a roast...get the idea? Cottage pie and Shepherds pie were originally a way to use things up as with pizza in Italy.

The was an average recipe, until I spiced it up using a few different ingredients. I've used leftover filets (or london broil or pot roast) instead of chopped meat. I added corn and peas to the recipe and I substituted the herb and butter mashed potatoes for a little extra flavor. The slightly revised recipe is fantastic!

This came out pretty good and my family loved it, although I thought it was just a little bit bland. Next time i will try increasing the seasonings a little. Didn't have canned gravy so whipped up a bit using some beef broth, a little red wine and a little tomato paste, along with some flour for thickening and some of the seasonings used in the recipe. I also added peas as suggested by another poster.

On a cool autumn evening, this was a warm comforting entree. As I prefer NOT to cook with fat, I left out the butter and added a splash of red wine to the mushrooms as I was cooking them. The fresh parsley in the recipe was delicious. The meal was a success and I have already been asked to make the Cottage Pie again! p.s. The leftovers were awesome as well!
