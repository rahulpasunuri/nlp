Good pizza recipe. I bought refrigerated pizza dough - so easy, so quick! I didn't add the mint as it sounded odd with the basil. I used baby heirloom tomates (Trader joe's) that are a variety of colors. We love Fontina.

I love making this recipe with veggies and herbs fresh from my garden, and it comes out great every time. I always just use pre-made crusts.

Really good. I made it without the mint and with more fontina than called for in the recipe. DH and I both liked it a lot.

This dish has a great combination of flavors. The proportions are well balanced, making it nice and light and not overly cheesey. If you don't have time to make your own dough, buy it from your local pizza place.
