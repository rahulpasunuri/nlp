I am from Senegal and I grew up eating Yassa. We prepare Yassa also with lamb chops or fish(whole tilapia, redsnapper...)However I never heard of anybody in Casamance or anywhere else in Senegal eat monkey, and never heard of monkey yassa. I think it is very offensive and misleading to incorporate untrue facts in somebody's culture. I really would appreciate it if you correct this mistake and make it known that in Senegal we do not eat monkeys. Thank you.

I learned to make this in senegal when I lived there as an exchange student, and used this recipe as a refresher. I have a few suggestions: first, scotch bonnet is the closest hot pepper to what they use in Dakar. Second, caramelize those onions! It's way better with them brown and crusty. Lastly, and this is not traditional, but I thought it was delicious, I added a couple of handfuls of raw peanuts to the onions as they cooked. You could use roasted ones too. Peanut oil in Senegal is less processed and therefore more peanuty, so this added a flavor dimension to the dish that it usually lacks when I have made it stateside. Senegal is also a "crusty rice" culture. If you have time and a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, I recommend pan frying your cooked rice in a small amount of oil for about 5 minutes over medium heat before you serve it. It is an extra step, but those little crusty bits are awesome and contribute a lot to the dish.

Well... this one definitely needs some tweaking. I have a benefit of working with a guy from Senegal, so... First onions need to be really caramelized, not just "cooked until tender". Then my friend gave me some boullion cubes he gets at an african store, but I think any kind will do. I usually use habanero peppers since I still have no idea what "Guinea pepper-type" is. Overall works very well, if you like lemon and onion combination. The flavor is fairly simple and subtle, don't expect indian curry type of dish here.

I was really excited to try the chicken yassa but it didn't end up like I thought it would. The only thing I can taste is the lemon. I even added garlic like someone else had mentioned but I cannot taste it at all.

I first had poulet yassa in Mali, at Sikasso's Hotel Mamelon (near the hill of the same name), and I've often returned to the simplicity of chicken, onion and lemon since then. This is an exceptional dish when grilled on charcoal. Most of the versions of the dish use vinegar, mustard, garlic, and bay leaves, and I recommend adding them to this recipe, along with a third again as much lemon and a much longer marinade time.

Why the raves? I don't get it. I followed the recipe to a T, and thought the dish insipid. I wouldn't make again, and perish the thought of serving this to company.

I used purple onions instead of the white onions, added some garlic and the juice of an orange. I also let the chicken marinate overnight in the frig. For better color and flavor (I tried this dish 3 times already) I split the cooking between the oven and the broiler. Maybe not strictly the same African recipe, but we enjoyed it!

I made this dish last night and was quite surprise at all the flavor it generated -- it was wonderful. I marinated the chicken overnight using spanish onions and white onion.

Chicken was very moist and tasty. I'd like to make this again with potatos and carrots. Very Yummy!

Very unique and delicious! I have always been curious to try African food and I am glad I did. I used 2 habeneros for my heat and that worked quite nice. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I agree with the poster below- if you dont use a whole chicken, 3 onions, 3 lemons, hot peppers and peanut oil you are missing out! 3 onions sounds like alot but it is not when you see the end product. The dish smells great, looks beautiful and tastes delicious. If you are in the mood for an exotic dish try this one

Wow! I could eat this dish for weeks on end. I used a habanero to get my spice, and the result was a clean, bright dish with wonderful aroma and presentation. The peanut oil is VERY important, I agree. And if you can handle onions as a major veg on your plate (cut thick so they still offer resistance to the tooth, but mellowed from simmering) try this unique dish! I served it with collards & mustard greens (not spicy) on the side and they were an excellent accompaniment.

For those who didn't use three onions, used chicken breasts, didn't use peanut oil, and/or failed to use hot peppers, you are missing out on what makes this simple dish flavorful

I am French & was born in Senegal, so of course I grew up eating Yassa, and after making and eating for many years (in the US) it is still the #1 meal in the family and guests! I actually make mine with limes to make it more citrus and the onions have to turn 'gold'! Tieboudien is also a great Senegalese recipe (rice and fresh fish)! HUMMMMM!

I thought three onions were too many, but I decided to stick to the recipe. BIG MISTAKE. It came out inedible. I think mistake #2 was sending the boyfriend to the store. He came back with white onions rather than yellow. I had never cooked with white onions before, think that just intensified the sharpness. If I was to ever try this again, I would definitely only use one onion. Very disappointing. Especially considering how long it takes to make this.

Well I didn't have peanut oil and couldn't find it so that would probably help the flavor, but I found this recipe kinda bland. Nothing very special. I'll try it again with peanut oil and stronger hot-peppers. Three onions also seemed like tons. I used one with three chicken breasts and that was plenty. Worth trying.

Definitely a winner! However, I thought 3 large onions was WAY too much...maybe it's just me, I'm not the biggest onion fan. On the whole, though, a delicious marinade--lemony and just a little bit spicy!

The Chicken Yassa was delicious. I wasn't able to determine exactly what kind of pepper was referred to by "hot red Guinea pepper-type chile" and used a jalepeno instead. My dish did not come out very hot, but the lemon-marinated chicken was delicious!

If you are a cook who REALLY likes ethnic cooking diversity, I recommend this dish. On my second time around, though, I added sage leaves to the marinating process ( about 5 fresh), and it tasted more complex, though bastardising the Senegalese version. Cheers to the original, though-they don't have sage in Senegal.
