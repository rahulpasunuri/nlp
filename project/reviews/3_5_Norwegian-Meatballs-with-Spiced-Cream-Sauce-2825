Nice recipe, i have made it a few times and agree with other cooks to chill the meat mixture well and then bake the meatballs. When I made these last night i didn't have enough cream so I used some sour cream as well and was inspired to add some horseradish and sliced mushrooms. It slips a bit into Stroganoff territory and is really yummy. Great served with steamed veg and fairly low-carb too!

I liked the sauce quite a bit. The meatballs themselves needed something extra. Was out of allspice so I used fivespice. Did bake instead of fry. Thought the bread amount was a bit much, will use less next time.

Tasty recipe - I served it with egg noodles that I added frozen peas to in the last few minutes of boiling. This dish also reheats well in the microwave if you add a little stock or broth before reheating.

Like others, I baked the balls in a roasting pan, deglazed the drippings, altogether delicious. But I'm kind of mystified by the cook who finds the recipe too rich, what with "all the butter and cream." At four servings, baking rather than frying, it works out to 1/2 T each of cream and butter per person. That doesn't strike me as terribly rich.

Recipe is awesome. I made the gravy and put some fresh parm cheese in it. Added 'al dente' ziti. Loved it.

My husband loved this recipe. I browned the meatballs first in the skillet then baked for 15 minutes. A very tasty dish. I added extra allspice too. I only had ground beef and used milk instead of cream and it was still very good.

This recipe tastes fantastic. I served them at a party, and they went fast. I baked them first for about 15 minutes at 400, and then moved them to a pan - this helped to keep them together and got rid of much of the grease.

Agree with previous cooks that baking would have degreased this some. Also added a splash of worstechire to the sauce, gave it a nice kick. Definitely a keeper!

Made this for the second time tonight and it's just great. The only change I made was to use half ground turkey and half ground beef but I think it wouldn't have made too much difference. Went to the store late after butcher left and there was no ground veal to be had. This will go in my permanent recipe book.

The recipe was awesome. Really easy to make and the meatballs turned out to be delicious. Agree with the other reviews on chilling the mix before making the meatballs. They can be hard to turn over while cooking. I lost at 3 meatballs as they crumbled into small pieces. Baking them is another great option. The only problem with baking is that you lose the drippings for the sauce. I will definately make this recipe again!

The meatballs came out great... used a mix of pork, veal and beef, and the recipe was very moist. Baked them in the oven, very simple. The sauce, however, was very bland. Dissapointing.

My alterations: I agree on baking the meatballs(tho I used all ground sirloin) and the Worcheshire sauce. I used the same pan to make the sauce.I put the broth in the pan, added mushroom and reduced. Then, added cream mixed with corn starch. Advantage: one pot and taking advantages of a less fat (as opposed to frying) enviornment and had great meat particles to add to the flavor. Also I put the rye bread in the food processor to make a finer fill. Served with chopped brocolli which was great with the sauce. Chianti was great with this.

It's so much easier to bake, rather than saute, the meatballs. I put them in a roasting pan with no butter or oil and baked them until brown. It browns them nicely on all sides and eliminates the need to chill beforehand. Depending on the pan you use, you can either put it on the stove to make the sauce, or scrape the drippings into the skillet.

We all loved this, though I made a few changes. My son hates onion bits in his meatballs, so I pureed the onion rather than chopping and sauteeing. Iused a pound of ground beef - no veal. Also, I added a scant 1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles to the meat. I also added a dash of worstershire sauce to the sauce. We all had seconds!

I was dissapointed with the results. The sauce was too thick, 2 tablespoons of flour are bit too much. Overall, the recipe is nothing special.

I didn't have the bread so I used plain bread crumbs. These were a little hard to handle but no big deal. They tasted great and my kids enjoyed them too. Served with some extra wide egg noodles and some vegies. Easy fast dinner.

I made a few changes based on what I had in my kitchen -- but I doubt they greatly altered the result you'd get using the recipe as written. But, in the interest of full disclosure: I used "meatloaf mix" -- equal parts beef, veal, and pork -- (about 1 1/3 lb package), three slices of day-old seeded sourdough with crusts (and the seeds) cut off. I was out of broth (my fiance was bringing some home on his way) so I soaked the bread in 2/3 cup milk instead (I do this for my "regular" meatball recipe and I like the results). The bread was very sturdy, so I ground the bread, milk, allspice and white pepper in the blender so it would be smooth, then whirred in the egg. I also added some salt to the meat mixture, as it seemed odd that there wasn't any. Followed the rest of the recipe as written, but added 1/2 cup of white wine (and some additional flour to thicken the extra liquid). Rewarmed the meatballs in the sauce while I made Spaetzle to serve with. Yum!

These are really delicious! I definitely recommend chilling the meatballs before cooking as they were a bit delicate and I had to be really careful while frying. The only thing I changed was to sauté a clove of garlic with the onion (I am addicted to garlic!) Next time, I think a really nice addition would be to add some pan fried mushrooms to the gravy. Those are my only suggestions - this recipe is a keeper for sure!

I had a craving for Swedish meatballs, and found this - great recipe and so easy to make! Because my butcher sells a "farce fine" which is equal parts veal and pork, I used that. And a little "fonds de veau" instead of canned beef stock. It was delicious. Will be making it again soon with this cold weather.

I made this recipe for my husband who was feeling very melancholy after looking through childhood picture albums. (his parents just recently passed away) His family moved here from Norway and had a famous family recipe for meatballs in gravy. Unfortunately I never recieved the recipe and to cheer him up I made the recipe I found here. It was wonderful!! He absolutely loved them and said they were (almost!) like grandma's! Dinner turned into a delightful and nostalgic evening and I will definately make these again. *Note: It is VERY important to chill the meat mixture for the specified time, and definately use veal and ground beef, the veal made the meatballs almost melt in your mouth!

Both my boyfriend and I thought this dish was delicious. I'm happy that I didn't have all the ingredients for the meatball recipe I usually make and had to find something new. The only change I will make next time will be to add a little less liquid to the meat mixture so that the meatballs hold their shape better.

I was lured in by the glowing reviews & the fancy title, but I was a little disappointed with the results. It's just meatballs with gravy -- & a really fattening version at that, what with all the butter & cream. I like meatballs & gravy, & I don't mind fattening if the recipe is wonderful. But I'm pretty sure I could have come up with something better on my own, without the recipe.

I modified this recipe by using ground turkey and shallots in place of the beef/veal and onion. The turkey worked well with the beef stock, but it didn't leave enough drippings to make a proper sauce. I used a tablespoon of butter instead and the sauce was luxurious. I served it with Roasted Root Vegatables and Swedish Saffron bread for Christmas eve. Everyone raved about this dish. Give it a shot.

My husband who lived in Scandinavia for 6 years LOVED this recipe. I used toasted rye instead of 2 day old bread. It's very important to make the ground beef mixture ahead of time to chill. Makes it much easier to form meatballs!

My family and friend really loved this recipe...especially the meatballs. We used Jimmy Deans sausage in place of the meat...IT WAS DELICIOUS. My friends and family loved the meatballs so much they ate them plain. I also doubled the liquid and used double cornstarch. We love lots of sauce!!

A change from the usual ground beef - tomato sauce pairings. Fairly quick to prepare. Nice with noodles.
