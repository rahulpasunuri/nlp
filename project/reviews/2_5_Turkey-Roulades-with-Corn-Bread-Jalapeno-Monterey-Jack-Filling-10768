I replaced the sauce in the recipe with a chocolate mole. I lined the turkey cutlet with the mole and then added the cornbread stuffing, rolled them up, dipped them in butter and corn-bread crumbs and baked. Got lots of kudos from the guests.

A little bland but tasty. The jalepeno was smooth and soft. Overall a fun texture. If you cut the turkey into similar sized peices, so that each would be held by one toothpick it would make a nice appetizer. A little popper!

It sounded like a good recipe, but it was too bland and visually was not appealing. I wonder if it would have been more moist if chicken breasts would have been used. But I'm not sure I'm willing to give it a second chance.
