Good Bean recipe. Works well with grilled Pork Chops too.

For the reviewers who are disappointed, might I suggest trying this again as it is apparent you're not from the South. The combination of beans and ham/bacon is a natural one in the South and is staple in cuisine. And, married with the suggested herbs the flavors are merely enhanced further. So please try again....

I was pleasntly supprised. I cautiously substituted the savory with fresh herbs I had on hand (can't expect to find everything the day before thanksgiving) and actually did forget the hot sauce (and had to cook it 15 minutes longer than indicated to get the lima beans to a worthy consistency) but I liked it. Can't say my guests were overwhelmed though. Not going to rush out and make it again but it's a dish for the back-up playbook, something to experiment with.

The weather just turned cold and I still have unripened tomatoes in the garden, so I was excited when I found this recipe. What a disappointment. I made it just as written, and thought the spices were a very poor combination with the ham and limas. If you make this, be sure not to leave out the hot sauce, though -- before I added the hot sauce, the savory, in particular, was especially objectionable.

This is really, really good. I did not have green tomatoes so I used a can of diced red tomatoes and it was excellent. I did not have allspice, savory or whole cloves so I didn't use the spice packet, but instead added a pinch of ground cloves and freshly cracked pepper. Served it with a salad and rice and even my lima-hating husband was converted. Yum.

It was delicious, but too much work for the result.

Out of this world and fast. I used a ham slice and served it with rice.
