Holy Cow! I made this pie for my teenage son, who loves butterscotch. I am surprised it made to the refrigerator to chill. It's that good! I was afraid of all the steps and review comments to that effect, but once I got the turkey in the oven, not a problem. Yes, I made this Thanksgiving morning- not my plan. I did make the crust the night before - used a different recipe (nut allergies) for the crust and followed other reviewers in using 1/2 the chocolate-glad I did. I did have some issues incorporating the whipped cream into the butterscotch mixture. I've always loved directions that indicate "gently and thoroughly" - right. There are a few whipped cream lumps in the pie, but I was a afraid to continue to mix any longer for fear of ruining it. All in all, very good. I might use 1/2 the amount of whipping cream next time to see if the butterscotch flavor is more pronounced - but that is more to my personal taste.

Made this according to the recipe for a dinner party last night and it was a hit. Here are changes I would make the next time. Reduce the amount of the crust by at least 25% it was just too thick. Reduce the amount of chocolate by 50% it was almost as thick as a candy bar at the bottom of the pie and reduce the amount of sugar in the whipped cream topping by half. I think those changes would allow the butterscotch flavor to be more pronounced and make for a more balanced pie.

The crust was tasty, but the filling was kind of bland. If you aren't going to eat the pie in one sitting, I don't recommend putting the whip cream on the pie - it loses its "whip" and melts all over the pie.

It is obvious from reading these reviews that half of these people never made it. Not labor-intensive? We used every bowl in the house -- some of them twice. At least two pans, a bowlful of ice, the mixer twice...Yet we give it four forks and a yes on making it again -- when we have lots of time! The pie is a delightful contrast in textures: Light whipped cream, fluffy butterscotch, dense but not hard chocolate and a cookie-like pecan crust. Each of the three children in our family choose a recipe and make a pie with me each Thanksgiving. My 15-year-old son, not given to self-deprecation, admitted this pie made by his 13-year-old sister was superior to his own. High praise indeed.

This is wonderful. My husband made this for Easter and everyone loved it. I have requested it for my birthday. This can be part of a fancy or a homestyle menu. The whipped cream combined with the butterscotch made it nice and light and contrasted well with the chocolate and crust. It wasn't too sweet like some butterscotch can be. We took it out of the refrigerator about 5 minutes before cutting and the chocolate was just right to cut. My only comment is that I would try a touch less gelatin next time and see if it still holds up as well, but it cut perfectly and it was not gummy like lots of desserts with gelatin can be.

I didn't find this to be terribly labor-intensive, but I also didn't think it was all that great. The nut crust was very heavy (possibly user-error...I had to handle it more than I would have liked in order to pat it into the pan) and the butterscotch layer was wonderful hot off the stove but sort of dense and texturally boring once it was chilled. If I were inclined to tinker, I might use only half of the gelatin, and double the amount of whipped cream in that layer to get a lighter texture.

hey, I'd forgotten about this recipe! I've made it several times, but not lately. It's absolutely wonderful. The chocolate bottom didn't get hard when I made it. My dad absolutely loves black bottom pie. He is not one to show much emotion, but when I made this for him he raved about it, and actually got this blissful expression I don't recall having seen before. I didn't find it overly labor intensive, but I would save it for special occasions because it is very rich! But fantastically yummy!

I have made this several times and although a little time consuming it very worth it! Do it in stages if you are concerned about the complexity. Give it a try.

The taste of this pie is great. Only one drawback: the chocolate for the "black bottom" gets quite hard, making the pie somewhat difficult to cut and messy to serve.

This is an excellent pie but rather time consuming. We save it for special occassions.
