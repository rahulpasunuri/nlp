I used Red Quinoa instead of Couscous, and adjusted the cooking accordingly. Even though quinoa is also a 2:1 ratio, there was excess water for some reason. Aside from that it came out great and I will make it again. Only next time I'll add some spice to balance out the sweetness of the raisins.

Lufarah gives great instructions on how to make this dish (or any cous cous dish). For those who think the cous cous is plain this type of cous cous is meant to be eaten with a spicy meat/sauce over it. The contradicting spicyness with the sweetness of the raisens is awesome. This is one of my favorite north african dishes when it is done right.

i am married to a north african and let me just say...all instructions in couscous packages are lies! the right way to do it is a bit more complicated, - i am posting a super simplified version - but worthwhile; soak 1 cup couscous in 1 cup warm water. fluff with fork to get rid of clusters. then put on a couscoussiere (like a colander with smaller holes that fits perfectly on top of a deep pot)and steam couscous over stock or sauce for about 15 minutes. remove from heat, fluff again and steam for another 10 minutes. fluff again, this time adding a couple of tbsp sauce or stock to flavor couscous. steam another 5 minutes, drizzle with a wee bit of extra virgin olive oil and mix with whatever you like.

I have to agree with Punkcook and Winston Salem: it's dry and bland. I followed recipe exactly and it's totally blah, is there an ingredient missing, something with *flavor*?

This was great. I omitted the lemon zest and added a tablespoon of cumin seed which I dry-roasted in a pan on the stove and then ground. Served it with merguez. Yummy!

As an Israeli, I loved this couscous ! it is a bit different from how we do at home, but it is a great recipe. I used chilli oil instead of garlic oil and it came out slightly spicy - very nice. Next time I will add some orange zest (to increase the warmth of the dish), fried onion rings on top, and boiled egg grinded - just to get that middle eastern taste.

We followed the recipe exactly and felt it was dry and tasteless. My husband ate it, but he eats everything. I wouldn't waste my time on this again.

Wonderful vegetarian dish, with possibilities for many variations. I did not have all the ingredients and substitued white beans for chickpeas, Isreali pearl couscous for regular couscous and dried cranberries for the raisins. Needs salt and pepper. Still kept its "Mediterranean" taste.

I used pearl Israeli couscous. Delicious.

A bit dry. I would add some more liquid &/or chicken broth. I ended up using olive oil on the finished product. That helped.

Good base receipe modified as follows: used dried golden raisins and cherries added orange marmalade (gave it a nice sweet flavor otherwise too bland). omitted garbonzo's on this pass. Will make again with

We made this recipe without the garbanzos and decide it needed something either buttery or sweet/tart. So we added about 1 TBSP of Orange Marmelade. Also, we used Golden Raisin and Dried Cherry Mix. Very yummy.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly (no garlic oil), so this isn't a really fair review, but I thought this was only ok. I agree with the previous reviewer -- too many chickpeas! Also a little dry -- which the sauceless salmon recipe doesn't really help with. I said I wouldn't make it again, but I should revise that -- I'll make a variation of this recipe.

Absolutely loved the flavor combination! Did not add the garbanzo beans (not a favorite of mine). Served alongside green beans with pine nuts and basil and a beef tenderloin! Wonderful meal!

A little boring, could have cut the amount of chickpeas in half, (it was a bit too much). Went well with the salmon, but would not make it again.
