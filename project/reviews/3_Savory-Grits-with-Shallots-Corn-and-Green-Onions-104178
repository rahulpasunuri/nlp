I've averaged this rating. Husband gave it four I a two. Which is odd, as I am the grits fan in the household. I usually won't review a recipe that I didn't make exactly, but I figured it was fair in this case. I didn't have shallots, so I used onion, and I added a couple pieces of crumbled bacon. And I made real grits, not quick. There was an interesting texture to it and a nice kick from the hot sauce. Definitely needs a little more salt, or add some to the grits while cooking.

Although I used excellent fresh corn, I found this only okay as written, maybe better with some added cheese or other spicing up. I used the leftovers the next day for fried grits, and that was pretty good. The men loved it that way.

I made this for a brunch gathering and it was a big hit. I also added goat cheese to the top and broiled it for a minute or two. It was so great my hostess and her fiancee finished it off and didn't leave me any!

I made these grits to go with a tri-tip roast and it got rave reviews from the family (even my mother, who "doesn't like grits" ate and liked these grits). I used fresh corn rather than frozen corn and I added a clove or two of garlic to the shallot mixture. I also added some Monterrey Jack cheese that I had handy. I'll definitely be making these again.

basic recipe -- i added sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese to liven it up a bit -- a big hit at the dinner party i went to.
