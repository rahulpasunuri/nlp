the recipe is a good idea to expand on; but "as is," was bland and way too much lime for me. I thought the lime/acidity greatly overpowered the delicate avocado. i had to do some major doctoring with what I had on hand... more avocado. I'm one to let simple, good ingredients do the talking. Just didn't work this way for me.

The soup was a little "green" tasting - almost had a grasslike quality. I am an avocado lover & I would choose a different recipe or tweak this one. I used adobo and greek yogurt & was pleased with that. I think it's a good starter for many tastes & possibilities.

Great recipe, I substituted chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for the ancho chile. Very Tasty!

The recipe as written is a little bland in texture and flavor. I doubled the amount of cayenne in the soup. The ancho cream is much better with a dash of cinnamon added to it to bring out the earthiness and soften any residual bitterness. I also added a pinch of salt to the ancho cream. and i successfully subbed in thick 2% greek yogurt, whipped with a whisk, for the whipping cream--it worked perfectly, and is a lot healthier that way. i also suggest garnishing it with something crunchy for textural contrast (I used toasted almonds).
