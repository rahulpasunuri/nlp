We're not huge fans of beets, so I found this while hunting for a recipe to use with our weekly co-op veggie delivery. It is tasty! We did substitute spinach and chard for the bibb lettuce. I, too, let the juices reduce more than the recipe called for.

This was delicious! My husband and I loved it. I made a few changes as I did not have dark beer or bibb lettuce, substituted with port and spinach. I also added toasted pecans. It would have been even better with a creamy goat cheese, I'll try that next time. Enjoy!

FYI - it is not necessary to 'peel' beets before cooking. Just cook with peel on, cool slightly, and the peeling will slip right off. My husband loved this...I'm not so sure. A different way to eat a healthy vegetable though!

An inspirational dish- though I did a few things a little differently. Instead of bibb (I know, it's part of the Name!) I used baby spinach. Also, when I added the beets to their "dressing" there was a lot of liquid, so I put it on high heat for almost 10 minutes and reduced it, which made it exceptionally thick and velvety. The combination of bacon and (in this case) spinach was dynamic and satisfying. Served to a group of 6, it was a hit! Beautiful, too.
