I served this with a light vanilla ice cream (Breyer's) and it was the perfect combination. The only thing I didn't like was the orange peel, I'll probably leave it out next time as it contributes an unnecessarily bitter flavor to this otherwise sweet and light dish.

This makes a very light and flavorful dessert along with a plate of your favorite cookies.
