Hugh hit with the family. Only a few modifications, okay maybe more but minor. 1st no hot sauce, my kid doesn't like spicy and I can't say that I missed it. Second, small family, so I used a split chicken and just put the oranges, garlic and ginger under the chicken. Instead of butter I used olive oil mixed with a some minced garlic and ginger. Lastly when the sauce was boiling I added some cornstarch and chicken broth to make a larger volume since I didn't add the water.

This was a big hit at the dinner table tonight. As I only had Chicken Marylands (thigh and leg) I followed the recipe as best I could. The chicken was moist and tasty and a beautiful glazed color. Next time, I will not add the water as there was plenty of liquid in the pan. Nothing worse than boiled chicken when you want it roasted. The chili sauce toned down the sweetness of the glaze.

The most flavorful and juicy chicken recipe ever! Delicious!!! Serve with the Green Onion Rissotto and sauteed bok choy for a completely delectable meal.

I tried this recipe yesterday, to great results. First I brined the chicken for about 3 hours prior to following this recipe. I read thru the reviews and decided to up the maple syrup (to 1/3 cup) and I added just 1/4 tsp tabasco. The result was a very tasty mahagony colored chicken that was moist and juicy. My husband loved this recipe and so did I. I highly recommend this recipe to all.

This was a fabulous dish, moist, flavorful and delicious. I omitted the pepper sauce because of dietary restrictions, but I can't imagine this would have made a substantial difference. We reheated the left-overs the next day with the sauce and it was still wonderful. A real winner!!

My boyfriend loved this. I just used split chicken breasts and orange juice instead of sherry. I will definitely make this again. I served it with the green onion risotto.

I have gotten far better results simply roasting a salted, peppered, and oiled chicken at 400 degrees until the internal temperature hits 170 degrees. There are problems with this recipe. The low oven temperature and frequent basting mean that the bird is in the oven for a long time and that it dries out. Spraying the bird with orange juice dries it out even more. A better method is to roast the bird with the fruit inside and then to drizzle the warm fruit juice after the bird has cooked. The sauce includes ingredients not always kept on hand and extra pans to clean are generated in making the sauce. In the end, the bird was neither flavorful nor moist. Given a choice of investing the time and money in this preparation or simply buying a store bought rotisserie bird, I'd go for the store bought bird and spend my time and money in some other fashion. I wonder what the editorial staff is doing? Untested internet recipes are a no less risky venture than this mess.

This has become my #1 'never fail to impress dish'. The color is wonderful. I did tent with foil the last 15 minutes. To save time, I readied the chicken the night before which imparted great flavor from the giner, organge and garlic. Once home from work, popped into the oven. My family raved over the taste and moistness.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I didn't have an orange on hand, so I just omitted it. I served the chicken over a bed of fresh spinach and the drippings from the chicken tasted great on the spinach.

We made this for Christmas Eve and it was great. The glaze was delicious; next time I'll add more maple syrup so it's thicker. We also stuffed the chicken with mushrooms and red potatoes that were extras from our side dishes. Cooking time in the recipe was on target.

Awesome! I have made this a few times and each time everyone loved it!

My husband and I made this for dinner tonight and thought it was moist and delicious. Due to what some of the other reviewers wrote, we were worried that the meat might not absorb the flavours of the glaze so we mashed some orange zest, chopped garlic and chopped ginger into the butter before rubbing it under the skin. It gave the chicken a lovely orangey flavour. My only complaint with the recipe was that the sugars in the orange juice that we squeezed over the chicken began to burn onto the pan almost immediately when we started the roasting so we had to add water much earlier than suggested. We did make the sauce and it was really excellent.

Yum! The only change I made was to add potatoes and onions to the roasting pan; they turned out really delicious, having absorbed all the flavors added to the chicken throughout the roasting. The glaze was more liquid than glaze -- maybe more maple syrup next time to thicken?

Simple and delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. Served with steamed carrots and green beans with a side of mashed sweet potatoes. YUM -- got raves from family.

This was a great change from the usual roast chicken recipes. It came out with beautiful color and was very moist Could probably use more ginger and I agree with others about adding toasted sesame oil.

Rating: 3
I think this is a nice break from the usual roasted chicken. I did add grated ginger to the glaze. I dont find this to be labor intensive at all and my husband loved it. Made awesome chicken salad out of the leftovers. We served smashed taters and roasted eggplant with it and drank a crispy Sauvignon Blanc. Perfect Sunday dinner.

This dish was a huge disappointment, sorely lacking in flavor.

Rating: 3
It was quite good. I did baste every 10 minutes, but didn't find the maple glaze to really "stick" like it should. With the green onion risotto, it was fabulous. I did add the sesame oil to the baste mix... I didn't really taste the ginger...I want to find a way to infuse the flavor into the baste.. Either way, I'd make it again!

This was so easy and fast to throw in the oven. The worst part was the consatnt basting but you must do it or else the bird won't be the same. it was delicious! The sauce adds extra zing so make sure to serve with the sauce.

OH...THIS WAS SO GOOD! The sauce was just wonderful. I used the left over chicken to make the MOO SHU IN MOMENTS, also on this web site. Had a tiny bit of sauce left over, so added it to the sauce in that recipe. Both were fantastic, and I love cooking once, and being able to do 2 dinners. Try it!

Fantastic! The ginger, garlic and orange flavors came through beautifully and the sauce definitely made the dish. This is now our favorite roast chicken recipe.

Very good, followed the recipe exactly,except I doubled the glaze. My chicken was larger than the recipe called for. My daughter is requesting this for her 10th birthday dinner.

Fantastic! I used blood oranges, because I didn't want leftover regular oranges (not a big fan) and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper instead of hot pepper sauce, but otherwise the recipe was very good and not difficult. The chicken stayed very moist, and the pan sauce was incredibly good. Two girlfriends and I ate this with green onion risotto and sauteed kale on a cold, snowy Sunday. Yum! Plus, with a roast chicken there are always leftovers for soup.

I found this dish incredibly disapointing. The flavor lacked, the color was poor, and there was nothing spectacular about the dish. I will simply roast a plain chicken next time.

This chicken was amazing, it was easy and smelled so good while it was cooking. I found with basting it with the glaze every 15 minutes it turned out to be a gorgeous mahogany color, and it was just delicious!

Delicious. A completely different taste for roasted chicken. I used regular syrup, b/c I didn't have any pure maple and it turned out great. I'm guessing the pure maple syrup would make the sauce thicker.

Rating: 4
Will make this again and again, it was soo easy and it was really good. I replaced the Sherry with the same amount of OJ and 1tbsp of vanilla extract, yummy. Served it with the risotto, the gravy was really good too. I think chicken should taste like chicken, what should it taste like? Fish? Anyway, this chicken taste like chicken with a hint of maple, soy, orang and ginger

The most important thing seemed to be to serve the sauce in a gravy dish at the table. The glaze didn't exactly take hold of the chicken so it didn't add too much flavor on the outside, but once you served it with the sauce it was delicious.

I agree with another reviewer. It tastes exactly like, chicken.

Not sure what the reviewer below was talking about--it didn't take "hours" to prepare. More like 1 1/2 from beginning to first bite. And what exactly is chicken supposed to taste like--besides chicken? My people were scrapping the pan for the last yummy bits while I printed copies for them.

Not worth the effort. Everyone at the table said "tastes like chicken". If I am gong to spend several hours preparing chicken, I want the diners to say wow!, not, Tastes like chicken. Don't bother.

Delicious!!! Made this with what I had in the pantry--used apple cider vinegar, orange juice instead of oranges, and white wine instead of Sherry...came out a beautiful brown color and was one of the moistest birds I've cooked.

Easy to prepare and taste good. Added roasted white sesame seeds into the sauce to give it some crunch

Oh! My! This was soooo good! I added about 1 1/2 tsps of toasted sesame oil. If it's soy sauce, garlic & ginger--toasted sesame oil is the next ingredient. The only change/addition. Loved it! Loovved it!

I browned boneless, skinless chicken breasts in olive oil with garlic and ginger. Next I added the sauce with a little orange juice and simmered chicken, turning often, until sauce reduced. Delicious served with rice and snap peas! Can't wait to roast a chicken with this tasty sauce!

I've made this dish three times now. My family can't seem to get enough of it. It is simple, elegant and delicious. As an addition, I've put some smaller onions in the roasting pan to cook with the chicken. They carmelize and go wonderfully with the chicken.

This was a hit as an easy weekday meal using a thawed turkey breast. But I will roast a chicken next time and expect moister (more chicken-like) results. Yummy!

I made this with chicken pieces instead of a whole chicken--it's a slightly refined chicken teriyaki. The hot sauce gives it a little kick and provides a counterpoint to the sweetness of the maple syrup. It didn't brown as nicely as in the photograph (I baked it at 425 for 45 minutes in a convection oven), but I may just need to tweak the cooking temperature. If I get the browning right, I'd up this rating to three forks.
