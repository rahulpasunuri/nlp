I upped the garlic and the sage and agree that it added a lot of flavor. I didn't find the pasta dry at all -- the turkey had plenty of juices in the pan. Simple and delicious.

The first few times, I made it according to the recipe and it was good. But then decided to experiment. Added a can of white beans and 3/4 cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes. Also added a cup of the pasta broth to make up for dryness. Excellent!

We thought this was outstanding. Very simple but surprisingly interesting layering of flavors. Don't substitute for the Asiago-- it's a much nicer match than a Parmesan would be. (Also, we used flaked Asiago which I think is better than a fine grate would have been.) We also didn't skip adding the last tbsp of butter (though I was tempted)-- and am glad we didn't because I think that's what kept the pasta from being too dry. We doubled the garlic and fried it up nice and crispy. Really very, very good.

So easy and simple to make, but I'd definitely add more garlic next time. Turned out great. Sage and sausage go so well together.

This was good, but not as good as I expected. Agree with the earlier reviewers as to the dryness of the pasta. Not sure if it needs pasta water or more butter. I used more garlic and sage. Not sure if I used too much sage and it overpowered the sausage. Anyway - will retry with some changes.

Love this recipe. Super tasty. I make it every couple of weeks now, and we all look forward to it. The crispy garlic is fantastic, i quadruple the amount, and make sure most of it ends up on my plate! Asiago is a must.

I've made this a number of times and it has never failed to disappoint. My boyfriend threatened to eat the entire pot of pasta the last time I made it. Delicious and very easy to make as well!

A friend made it twice for dinner and I have to say this is very, very flavorful. She might have increased the amount of sage. Very simple and tasty!

I've made this recipe quite a few times now and each time I do it a little differently. I think it works best with a curly pasta like farfalle instead of fettuccine. Whole wheat farfalle works especially well. I also like to replace the butter with olive oil. Once I tried parmesan instead of asiago and it was not nearly as good. Also, to simplify the steps (not that they're very complex as written), I mince the garlic and leave it in to cook with the sausage and sage. This recipe is good as is, but can be tinkered with to make it even better.

It was super tasty. My only reason for giving it 2 instead of 3 is it was a little oily. It's very quick and easy!

Great, super easy recipe. I used real sweet pork sausage and added 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes. The tomatoes give it a nice sweet flavor and when I do this one again I think I will increase that to 1/2 cup. Also, other have suggested upping the sage, which I would recommend too. Got raves from small dinner party with a side salad with red wine vinaigrette.

this was VERY good! I am 14 and i made this quick and easy. Next time I make this I will add more cheese and sage.

Pretty tasty. I was gunshy about burning my garlic, so I took them out before they were crisp. No big deal, just added them back in later. I couldn't taste the sage, so I'd up the quantity next time. Overall, a good combo of ingredients.

Really tasty weeknight fare. Simple to make.

This was fast and yummy. As another reviewer stated, good enough for company. I used an 1/8 cup of canola oil and next time I will omit the Tbsp of butter butter at the end.I used roasted garlic linguine and hot turkey sausage so I omitted the red pepper flakes. Don't forget to reserve about a cup of pasta sauce to add at the end to your preference. Next time I will double the garlic, just because I love it so.

I have made something similar to this with shrimp and vegtables before. This dish is wonderful - love how the sausage flavor runs throughout the pasta. Made as stated, but I added mushrooms.

I made the whole meal with this recipe...broccoli with asiago & salad with oranges. Very tasty!! Great family meal. I will definitely be making it again. Next time for company!

This was defenitely a recipe that I would make again. It has a great combination of flavors that compliment each other very greatly.

Made with a group of girls who enjoy cooking together and all seven of us plan on making again. The crispy garlic was a fun technique that I plan on using on salads, etc.

(A note for those interested in the "green ring" in the photo- the recipe published called for a side of roasted broccoli with asiago cheese. The first half of the recipe is intructions how to roast- the pasta portion begins with the "Meanwhile...") This was a quick and very tasty dish- great for a weeknight meal. The crispy garlic is a must!

Rating: 4
LOVED this dish... yes, the "Meanwhile" surely refers to cooking the pasta. I used whole wheat linguine and it was wonderful. LOVE the crispy garlic. I used mild turkey sausage but added a pinch of red pepper flakes. This is a KEEPER! I also wonder what that green stuff is in the photo though!

I made a homemade turkey sausage that was wonderful, but the pasta was too dry. Good flavor to build on.

I have not tried this recipe as yet but am confused with the ring of what looks like some sort of greens surrounding the fettuccine

The flavor was excellent but it was a bit dry. Next time I will try adding some of the pasta water as previous reviewer suggested. My garlic didn't get crisp but still tasted wonderful.

What a wonderful and simple meal. I had to complete this without the sausage (yes, I know! Not the same recipe. A terrible oversight when shopping), but even as a non-meat dish, it was flavorful and satisfying. The simple combination of sage and asiago was perfectly complemented by the lovely crisps of garlic. We enjoyed this with Roasted Broccoli with Asiago which was out-of- this-world delicious and the surprise hit of the meal! The family members that were home for dinner last night loved it and agree that this is repeat-worthy. Next time, Ill be sure to have the sausage ready and waiting, but if I get caught again without, I wont hesitate to serve this again; although I might add a small amount of béchamel to tie it together.

Is something missing? Why does this recipe start with "Meanwhile..."? I'm guessing the first paragraph is just to add the fettuccine to boiling water?

I loved the garlic crunch but I am not sure if this was a recipe that just didn't quite go right, or perhaps there we didn't use the right type of Italian turkey sausage...but it was not memorable at all.

This is FANTASTIC! Restaurant quality pasta dish. My garlic was not 'crispy' but still tasted good. I readded it the last 5 minutes of cooking to warm it up again. Love the Asiago cheese. Even the kids ate this...

Delicious. Easy to make, and the cheese gives a great flavor without a heavy cream sauce.
