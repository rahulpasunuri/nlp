For heaven's sake, did not realize this was a Jamison recipe. I made it the first time July 24, 2000 and just ran across it in an old folder. We thought it was wonderful and I'm ready to make it again!! Jean Denham, a Chef's Journey

Pan fried the salmon, and used peppered bacon but otherwise followed the recipe. This is a keeper.

Made this last night for dinner and everyone enjoyed it. Adapted it to what I had on hand. Used tilapia, dried basil for the marinade and marinated at room temp for 30 mins, removed a lot of the bacon fat before cooking the onion, used unadulterated mayo on the sandwich. Very tasty will make again.

I completely messed this up. I didn't read through the recipe and added all the basil and lemon to the mayo. I also over-grilled the bread. Nonetheless, this was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is so simple and has such amazing flavor! The only thing I changed was grilling the salmon on a cedar plank.

Mmmmmmmm! I love this sandwich! My husband who is not much of a Salmon eater, took this as a late night snack after we had, had it for supper earlier that day. He NEVER does this; so it must be good!

These were outstanding. I have made them twice and they were a big hit both times. The second time I used dried basil and baked the salmon - it was just as good.

Made the salmon itself and mayo. Great. Bacon was not even considered.

Awesome sandwich. Just make sure you season the mayo to taste (i always end up using more salt) On recommendation from another review, used smoked cheese instead of bacon (vegetarian girlfriend) and came out great (but would like to try it with bacon one day on my own.

made this & a couple of other epicurious sandwiches for a poker night & they were a big hit. the dressing & bacon soaked onions really give it a lot of flavor.

Really good, hearty but somehow light. I didn't use the bacon (I don't eat red meat) and the sandwich missed it. Next time I might try some smoked mozzarella, or something to give it a bit of smoky flavor; it needed the depth. Even without it, though, it was a really, really good sandwich. Although there's a lot of "waiting" time, the actual prep didn't take too long, and it was certainly easy. I pan-fried the fish instead of grilling it, and it got VERY oily. Next time I would drain off the marinade before cooking, and use cooking spray instead of the olive oil I fried it in. Salmon is so oily I don't think it would have stuck to the pan anyway.

Messy to eat but absolutely delicious. I love salmon, and this is definitely one of my favorite recipies. I agree about the salt. Season the fish before grilling and add some salt to the mayo as well. Brushing the fish with oil before putting it on the (very hot) grill prevents sticking. This sandwich got rave reviews...one of my guests said it was the best meal he had ever had! I served it with spicy oven fried potato wedges and vinegar based slaw. A delicious addition to the "salmon" section of my recipe book.

In the picture this sanwich looked so delicious I had to make it. I bought the very best ingredients, Salmon so fresh you could eat it raw, bread from a local bakery. basil from my garden etc. Well, Yes it needs salt (which I thought would come from the bacon). It was VERY messy to eat, but I don't mind that. My problem was the marinade, which added no flavor and the mayo which I expected much more from. I will make this again but with salt, different mayo and my own marinade. Great Idea. Like another review said, HUGE sandwich but we didn't feel miserably full after eating it. It has potential.

My family of five really appreciated this recipe, although they picked off what they didn't like in the sanwich. As my salmon fell apart during grilling, I think next time I will grill it, add it to the basil/mayo, and serve it as a spread. They can then add to their sandwich just what they wish (as with a tuna salad sandwich).

Though we weren't crazy about this as a club sandwich, it's a great way to cook salmon. So next time we'll have the grilled salmon with a salad on the side.

A vegetarian who eats both fish AND bacon. What an interesting interpretation.

This was very good. The salmon needed some salt and pepper and a sandwich is always topped with cheese! Overall keeper!

This was wonderful. I used pita bread, but instead of stuffing it I used two pockets (one for each slice. I made the basil mayonnaise the night before and even used dried. I can't say enough about this. The sandwich's were a nice size, but we did not feel so full that we were miserable (the salmon being much lighter than meat). My husband, being a sandwich lover gave it two thumbs up!

So far, all the reviews rate this dish 4 forks. How is it that only 86% would make it again?

This was the very best salmon recipe I have ever made. I left out the bacon though, only because we dont eat it. My family cant wait until I make it again.

This sandwich was the hugest hit with my family!!! All three of my kids (10, 8,&6) ate it all and asked for more!! I agree that it was messy, and a little more involved than an average sandwich.(Time-wise) I have made this recipe as many times as I could when fresh salmon is on sale in our area. We all agree that it is one of the best salmon recipes that I have yet to find!!

I can't believe it says only 50% would make again. This was delicious. It was a little messy while eating, but a plethora (!) of flavor. I highly recommend this (especially inthe summer).

A great, easy sandwich that was excellent for a picnic. Made ahead 30 minutes and it was great!

This is so delicious and tastes as good as the picture in the July issue of B.A. My son has out of town company & he requested it for dinner & I am making it for the 3rd time.
