oh yes. tried the recipe from vancouver and found it very successful. made a bunch of tiny 2-inch fricos, and used cracked black pepper instead of chives. didn't have waxed paper, so I just greased pan very generously, and tried to be speedy with my removal. as a result, could only bake 8 at a time--more than that, and the remaining crisps would harden onto the pan.

But -- LOVED Vancouver's recipe, will be a new staple at our house.

i attempted to make these for a tapas party. They were more trouble than they were worth. If you don't cook them for long enough they are chewy. There is a very fine line between being "done" and overdone which imparts a burnt taste (even though they only look just past golden). So between the time and attention factor (not to mention waste of over or under done crisps) and the fact they were too oily for my taste i abandonned them for another recipe.

My oh my, these crisps are highly addictive! I have been making a variation of these for several years. 1/2 lb parmesan cheese finely grated - about 4 cups and 2 tbsp finely snipped fresh chives. Line baking sheet with parchment paper, sprinkle the parmesan in mounds of about 2 rounded tbsp and flatten slightly to a 4" round. Bake at 500 degrees for 2-3 minutes or until light golden and bubbling. Sprinkle with chives and return to oven for another 30 seconds to 1 min. Place on wire rack to cool for a 2 minutes then remove with a metal spatula. Absolutely scrumptious and so good served with drinks, or crumbled onto a salad or soup. Couldn't be easier and you will be amazed at how delicious and crispy they are. Give it a try - you will not be disappointed!!! Note: be sure to use good quality fresh cheese such as Parmigiano Reggiano and definitely not the yucky powdered supermarket cheese. So much easier to bake in the oven than to fry in a pan.
