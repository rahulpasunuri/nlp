I really liked the Dijon mustard in this dressing. Also, I liked that it had a variety of veggies instead of just cabbage and carrots. I think, though, that it is very heavy on the mayo. I would cut it in half, and decrease the sugar as well. Overall, though, I thought it was very tasty.

I can see why some people would add lkee a tablspoon or two of sugar to cut the cabbage taste, but a half a cup, that's like making it a dessert in my opinion. But there again, I grew up with spicy coleslaw that had not one iota of sugar in it. But everyone is different
