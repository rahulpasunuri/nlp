The mousse was not very lemony and it left "juice" at the bottom of the cups! Not the best mousse I've made...

I don't think fat-free half-and-half is available in Canada, but I've substituted evaporated skim milk for it in the past with success. This substitution addresses the concerns about chemicals that some readers have raised.

I served this to friends that were on a diet with high hopes. I love lemon but it just was'nt very tart. Disapointing. I think next time I'll make sorbet. MY GOODNESS, people really do get worked up about these recipes don't they. Most entertaining.

The lemon peel was very overpowering, it left a nasty aftertaste in my mouth. Next time I would use half the lemon peel or substitute lemon juice. It also needs more sugar. Otherwise, it is nice served with a fresh berry coulis and garnished with mint sprigs.

I thought this was very good. Of course the real thing would have been better, but for someone trying to lose weight, it was very good. It is a dessert that is so low in calories, you don't even have to worry about them.

Not to be nit-picky but FF half&half is NOT like olive oil (a natural product) but rather a chemically synthesized "fake" dairy product. If you do a little reading on the subject it should become obvious that chemically synthesized food is NOT good for you regardless of fat content. As a biomedical scientist I can guarantee you that in fact plenty of FDA approved food additives are indicated to cause or perpetuate cancer in lab animals. SO I'm not trying to be the food police BUT be wary of what you eat and what kind of toxins your food was treated with. FDA approved does not mean it's good for you...it just means that it has not yet been proven to actually be harmful!!!

Hey Virginia, lighten up! There are lots of people out there who want fat free desserts and are willing to use "fake" substitutes to mimic flavor of the real thing. I for one am glad to know about this fat free half and half. Anyone who uses this website is into food and can read the ingredients and decide for herself what to ingest. Get off your high horse! Food Police need to stop the brutality and practice respect

Fat free half and half? Isn't that skim milk? I hate to think that these two venerable magazines with their tradition of fine food are going to start printing recipes involving fake ingredients brought to us by America's food processing and chemical industries. There are plenty of other magazines and websites with recipes involving such trash as processed "cheese product", non-fat "mayonaise" and artificial sweetners. Up to now, this hasn't been one of them!

Nice and light, but.. The ingredients on the fat free half and half were too scary so I used the real stuff. Also served it with a simple berry compote over top (used frozen raspberries and blueberries) and will always serve with something similar in the future.
