Having read the previous reviews, I made these early on christmas eve morning thinking I could run out and buy something if they didnt turn out so hot. Then I had a dilemma--they didnt turn out lousy but they certainly didnt look as good as the photo and they're somewhat bland--not bad enough to sub store bought, not quite festive or flavorful enough to set out proudly. I ended up heavily glazing them with apricot and then drizzling dark chocolate on top and that spruced them up a bit. I think the problem we're all having is that we're spreading the dollop of frangipane too wide to accommodate the banana slices --you need to leave a slight border between the knife score and the fork punctures--there needs to be some room for the steam to escape from the bottom and that would probably allow the outside to puff up higher. The frangipane's good but it needs a tad more salt and some vanilla. The puff pastry is a definite miss. Next time i'll use the frangipane and make a tart with pate sucre--in a tart pan.

I have always had great success with all recipes from Bon Appetit, however this one was very disappointing. I had the same experience as one of your readers where the frangipane just flowed over the pastry preventing it to puff. I would only make it again if I knew exactly what went wrong.

The tartlets were very tasty - our guests enjoyed them. Adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream was a very nice pairing for the dessert. HOWEVER, we had the same problem as the other review - the frangipane flattened instead of rising. It overflowed the pastry and looked more like a cookie than a tart. Good dessert if you like flavor over appearance.

These tarts were good. Only about half of mine came out looking like the recipe. My dough didn't puff evenly in the oven, so the topping and bananas slid off several of them. I made the frangipane the night before and thought they were fairly easy to prepare.
