Great combination of flavors, but very subtle. On the second trial, we doubled everything except for the salt -- which we quadrupled (we used kosher salt) -- for the same quantity of potatoes and found we enjoyed them considerably more.

These were excellent! (And super easy!) I added a bit more cumin, as we love it and I noticed some reviewers said the potatoes lacked flavor. I also cut my potatoes in wedges as I like the presentation. They were fabulous with marinated tri-tip! GREAT RECIPE!

I make these potatoes all the time, great with almost any chicken dish.

I was expecting a much more flavorful potato given the ingredients. I used small red potatoes (whole). I thought they were okay but probably won't make them again without some modifications to the original recipe.

I've made this recipe so many times now--we always have to pick at the potatoes right after they come out of the oven! Most of them don't even make it to the dinner table. I have doubled this recipe for larger groups. If you decide to do the same, use 5 cups of oil instead of 6. Unlike the previous reviewers, I find the potatoes require the full 35 minutes of roasting time. Give these a try if you haven't already. You will not be disappointed!

Followed the previous reviewers' advice and it turned out excellent. Stir around on the baking sheet often, tho, to prevent sticking to the foil. Great with the marinated pork and red onion dish.

We like the simplicity of roasted potatoes and this recipe IS simple and VERY flavorful. I actually mixed the coating in a bowl, tossed the potatoes and then put them on a baking sheet. The roasting time is only 20-25 minutes.

We were at a friends for dinner on Saturday and she made these potatoes. I thought they were really good and had an excellent cumin flavour, and they were kid friendly...my 4 yr. old even ate them. I also recommend the mixed salad with roasted beets and walnuts from the same issue...delicious.
