I made this tonight with leftover turkey instead of roast beef and all the other ingredients as stated in the recipe. It was delicious. Loved the poached egg over the dish. Kids were happy to eat it too.

I was skeptical about the orange zest, but it was really good!

This is a great recipe. Hopefully you have a youngster, maybe a child or a sibling, because cooking means cutting, chopping, there is a whole lot of sous before you chef. Long story short, lots of chopping. You can do a lot of this in advance. If possible use a well-heated cast iron skillet for the finish. 5 minutes per side was not quite enough with my T-Fal. Didn't use green pepper just red.

I didn't have the orange zest, but this is a great way to cook leftover roast. This one is now on the regular leftovers menu.

Wow. This is the best tasting hash I have ever had. And I didn't have any bell peppers around. I will make this again and again and again.

This was surprisingly good. The family enjoys corned beef hash, but this is the first really flavorful roast beef hash we've had. Don't omit the orange zest, it is a key ingredient.
