I made some adjustments when I prepared this dish: doubled the marinade for the pork and corn plus added the fresh rosemary and garlic from the bean and potato dressing, used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine...did not double the amt. of hot pepper flakes. Marinated the whole pork tenderloin for three hours in the fridge...saved out some of the marinade to serve with the grilled pork. Grilled and basted with marinade. Sliced and served with risotto, corn on the cob with lime butter and steamed broccoli. My kids (age 7 and 12) loved it and ate every bite. My husband said it was the best pork he every had...and we are avid chefs on the weekends!! I will def. make this again for company asap!!

I'm cooking the kebabs/potatoes right now. Just a tip for the person who said it was too hard to cut and skewer the corn. I was having a hard time skewering until my husband walked in and suggested screwing the corn in until it got started. Easy after that tip!

this is a good everyday dish, quick to prep and satisfying.the pepper sauce/marinade, while pleasing and complementary to the vegies, just isnt special enough for entertaining. for those looking for a variation, i modified this recipe to use what i had on hand: used the pepper sauce to marinade chicken tenders, and added pattypan squash to the potatoes and beans, while doubling the dressing for the veggies. the vegies, in particular, reminded my husband of the kind of traditional Italian dish his mom would make when he was a boy.

Corn was spectacular, we'll use the baste and grill whole corn often. Pork was very good, but not amazing. We'll repeat the whole recipe occasionally for variety, but it's not a favorite.

I will NEVER again cut corn cobs and skewer the pieces as the recipe calls for-WAY too hard! But the corn was delicious, so next time we will grill it whole, using the baste. There was so little baste that I used it all up basting pre-cooking, but it turned out fine. The raw garlic and rosemary on the vegetables didn't thrill the first night, but the leftovers from the whole meal were delicious on salad the next night, which is why it gets three forks.

This dish is nothing special (wouldn't serve it to guests) but WOW is it flavorful! We loved it! It was somewhat dry, however, so next time I may consider serving it with some type of sauce or chutney.

A nice meal. the only problem that I encountered was that the corn had to be cooked separately before I could place it on the skewers.

We added onion to the kebabs for a little something extra. The rosemary green beans and potatoes are exceptional. We've made them as a side dish for all kinds of meals. They're a favorite of our 16-year-old boy.
