Love this soup! I was introduced to this soup by a friend and had to try it for myself. I made mostly as indicated. I used homemade chicken stock and bees broth. I also used the slow cooking barley. I ended up needing to add some chicken bullion to make broth seasoning sing. I added too uh water for the barley love this recipe. I will make it again and again.

Fabulous. Used leg of lamb trim, browned & placed in crockpot. Sauteed vegetables and added to crockpot; deglazed pan with water, and continued recipe in crockpot, adding in the leg bones to enrich the broth. Cooked for the afternoon. Yum!

This is an excellent, flavorful and easy recipe for any cold day Kale is an excellent source of nutrients, and adding it to all of these flavors makes it tender and delicious. I serve it with crusty bread for a wonderful comfort meal.

First time made as indicated, except used swiss chard instead of kale (we don't like kale :)). It was more than OK, we did like it. Next time, I experimented: made some lamb broth from trim and leg bones and used it for part of the liquid. Added more barley to get a stew consistency. Big mistake, unless you love the smell of mutton! Boy it was strong. Still, the recipe is a keeper.

This made a perfect first course for Burn's Night. Minor changes: saute the onion, carrots in olive oil to start, added chopped kale ribs, carrots, continue until onions soft but not brown. added barley and coated with veg sautee and toast for a few minutes before adding broth. Cook until barley nearly done, then add chopped kale. Following the suggestions on a previous review, I browned the lamb separately with a small amount of olive oil, poured off the fat, then deglazed the pan with the malt vinegar and tipped that in following the lamb towards the end. Added another 1.5 cups broth/water at end since the soup was a bit thicker. Served first course with choice of Bruichladdeh Port Charlotte First Cut (May 2007 Feis Isla) and Laphroig 19 year. Yummm... Best Burn's Night supper!

Nice winter soup. A sprinkle of crushed red pepper jazzes it up very nicely.

We loved this hearty soup. The grocery store did not have kale so I substituted frozen turnip greens, and also added a bit of red pepper flakes at the end of the cooking time. Excellent!

This was so so good! I'm not sure how it could be thought of as bland. The only thing I did differently was the process...I got the veggies going first, added bulgur (didn't have barley) and then cooked the lamb in a separate pan, deglazed with the vinegar and added into the stock pot. I was starved so I was looking to save time! Yum, yum! And so good for you!

will make again but I fund it a bit bland.

Delicious, hearty soup. I made it as directed, but substituted a combination of vegetable and lamb stock as I didn't have beef. Tasted very good regardless.

This was hearty and tasty. I used the apple cider vinegar instead of malt vinegar and found that overall it was lacking in the sour/tang flavor that malt provides. So, I improvised and added a bottle of dark beer to my double batch, and sure enough the malty tangy flavor did the trick. The results were delicious.

It looked healthy and different, so I made it. I thought it would be kind of bland since there weren't many spices, but it was suprisingly flavorful. And sweet for some reason. Although it is not going to make my file of Favorite Recipes, I was certainly pleased with the way it turned out, and if you are a fan of lamb, you're likely to LOVE it.

I made this last night, while it was snowing and cold outside, and it was wonderful. I used half the amount of barley as my husband is not a fan of it, and I simmered it for 45 minutes as I did not have the quick-cook variety. Served this soup along with toasted and buttered Kalamata Olive bread. This was a wonderful wintertime meal.

We had this as a first course for a Burns Dinner and it was absolutely the best part of the meal. I'm looking forward to making this again as a main course with bread. Very hearty, flavourful and delicious.

This was a wonderful dish, I made it pretty much as directed, with the exceptions of I had to use medium barley, because I couldn't find quick-cooking barley...I just lengthened the simmer time to 40 mins. And I added a couple of small turnips, diced. The flavor blended together, to a warm and hearty dish.
