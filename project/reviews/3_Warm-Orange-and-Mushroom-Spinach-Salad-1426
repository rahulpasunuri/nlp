I liked the salad, but really enjoyed the dressing. It was quite original.

This is a wonderful salad. I omitted the bacon, since I don't eat pork and replaced it with toasted hazelnuts...a fabulous healthy alternative.

very disappointing -- good concept but just didn't work.

This was very good. I couldn't do the bacon fat thing. I added bacon bits to the salad. The flavor was excellant. I will make again the same way.

This was great, i cooked it for a friend of mine, he was absolutely mad about it and keeps bugging me to make it again. WHen i made it i only used one type of mushrooms (your regular variety) and replaced half of the oranges with grapefruit, it went over quite nicely.

I made this for a dinner party last night to rave reviews, it was gobbled up in minutes! I didn't use the radiccio because I usually find it to be bitter, but next time I will give that a try. So I used about 1 and a half bags of baby spinach. The dressing was delicious and I think while reducing the bacon drippings is a good idea (olive oil has a nice flavor with this salad), you still need a little bit of the drippings to enhance the flavor. To go with what I had in the kitchen, I used tangerines instead of organges, and a carton of baby portabellas instead of the shitakes/enokis. I also ended up burning the hazelnuts while toasting them, but I had sliced almonds and used them instead. I can't wait to try this recipe again and I probably will within the next couple days -- but this time I will keep it all to myself so I get to eat it all. :)

I loved this dressing as it had a very good set of flavors. In the salad I omitted the radicchio and shiitake mushrooms. I also substituted the following: crisped prosciutto for the bacon, olive oil for the drippings, and peanuts for hazelnuts. Added two sliced hard boiled eggs. We loved it and will definitely make it again. Makes for a wonderful light dinner.

We absolutely loved the zing mixture of flavors in this salad. The orange and the balsamic vinegar really makes this dish sing!! A truely refreshing salad! I didn't have all the ingredients, using the following substitutions; plus, I didn't want to make the full amount. Dressing: 2 bacon strips, orange juice 1/4 cup, balsamic vinegar & oil together 1/4 cup, 1 green onion, slivered almonds. Prepared Salad greens adding oranges slices, shiitake mushrooms (cooked with 1 tbs of bacon grease), almonds. Cooked dressing w/ bacons cut up until it formed a syrup texture and drizzled over salad. I ended up adding a little more balsamic vinegar to thin it out a little.

When I made this, the dressing was terrible due to all the bacon fat. I put it in the fridge and scraped the fat off the top - then it was delicious. So, when I make again (this weekend) I'm going to skip the grease in the dressing, add a bit more olive oil and should be perfect. I would definitely recommend the oyster/shitake, or mix of wild mushrooms.

I went with two substitutions, the canned mandarin oranges and regular brown mushrooms instead, this made preparation easier. The salad has great presentation and was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was really good. I admit I did simplify things, in accordance with the contents of my kitchen. Substitutions: vidalias for the shallots, canned mandarin oranges for the oranges, button mushrooms for the shiitakes & oysters AND sliced almonds for the hazelnuts. This one is going into the Family Favorites binder.

I served this salad at a company picnic: one coworkers' wife took a big serving (it does look very colorful) and then, after a single bite, threw the rest in the woods behind the port-o-jon.

I was excited by this recipe when I found it because it "sounded" so good. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. I served it to six people at a dinner party and all thought it to be bland and nothing special. I think the problem is a salad dressing that just is not very tasty.

Our gourmet group loved this recipe . It was delicious and colorful. Flavors were mild and, mushrooms were wonderful, hazelnuts topped it off with a crunch . Definetly will make again.
