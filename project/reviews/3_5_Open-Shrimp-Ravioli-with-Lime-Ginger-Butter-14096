Needs to have a lot more lime, ginger, butter flavor. Most of the sauce diffused as the won-tons boiled.

Well... not as good as expected... there are much better options out there. I can't put my finger on it... but the flavors worked .. just not as well as I had wished. I did make one ravioli as directed.. was not impressed.. so just pulsed the remaing shrimp mixture and made actual raviolis, boiling until the wontons were tender... plated on top of the "sauce"... much easier for me to eat... the whole "deconstructed" thing was messy with out merit.

I borrowed the sauce portion of this recipe since I had pre-made shrimp ravioli in the freezer and wanted something different to make with them.n This is so easy and delicious; you can add as little butter as you want. For those of you lucky enough to be able to shop at Surfa's in LA, their shrimp ravioli bring a little bit of spice to the dish. My husband usually eats slowly but had this dish done so quickly, I commented, "Boy, you hated that!"

The flavor combinations are WONDERFUL, however assembly was a problem. These are so delicious I kept making them until I figured out a better way to aseemble them. Instead of wontons, I use no- boil lasagna noodles, which I plunge into boiling water until softened. Then cut each noodle into two squares. I also chop the shrimp, reserving a half shrimp for each ravioli as garnish. Very different and delicious!

Disaster. Wontons totally fell apart; the presentation was a mess...virtually a blob. A lot of work for a pile of squishy wontons and a shrimp-sauce. Would be embarrassed to serve to a human being. There are so many better ways to serve shrimp!

Great flavor, but also had trouble with the wonton wrappers tearing even with oil in the water. Instead of using the final wonton as the top, I used instead the shrimp and sauce as a prettier presentation.

This is a sublime dish. The flavors are delicate and the presentation is lovely.

This recipe is very tasty, light and easy to make. As other reviewers, I used a small amount of angel hair pasta and it was delicious! Highly recommend!! Great flavors

When it says 2 servings, it REALLY means 2 servings. I made this as the main course for dinner, when it really should've been the appetizer. I agree with the other responses: the wonton wrappers are very difficult to handle.

Made this for dinner last night - it was fabulous! I used leeks instead of shallots, and doubled the sauce. I did, however, have a MAJOR sticking problem with my wontons. I agree with the other cook that 3 minutes is way too long - they were goopy and slimy. Will cook them for less than a minute the next time. Otherwise, it was awesome!

Wow! Made this with my friends. We decided to add some garlic, then whisked in some heavy cream. It was HEAVENLY!!! Everyone would make it again!

This is a great recipe - quick enough for a weeknight but fancy enough for a small dinner party if you double or triple it. Make sure to taste the sauce before adding more lime juice than what's called for. I added a little extra, but I think 1/2 teaspoon would've been perfect. To keep the wonton wrappers from sticking together, I just dunked them in the boiling water with tongs for about 30 seconds - I can't imagine boiling them for 3 minutes. Also, I didn't bother stacking them, but instead arranged the wontons on a plate and topped them with the shrimp mixture, then the sauce. Delicious!

I made traditional ravioli using my usual pasta recipe and enclosed shredded carrots and diced red peppers with the shrimp inside the ravioli. It was delicious. One of my guests wrote the following day to say that it was the best ravioli she'd ever had.

I was so disappointed by this dish. I made this with a bunch of friends as it was a much talked about dish among us, and i really felt it lacked so much. I don't think it had any strong taste at all, and it should have given that theres a lot of ginger and lime in there. sad.

This is absolutely the most surprisely wonderfully tasting dish. When I made it for the first time and served it as the main course for a little dinner party I threw at home, my guests all loved it. I did not use the wonton wrappers though, as I did not have the patience to handle them. Nonetheless, the dish turned out beautifully. The green scallion and cilantro contrasted well with the orange-red shrimps and carrots.

This is one of my favorite recipes on the site. My husband loves this, and it always feels like a special evening when we serve it. I can't rave enough about how good it is. The only annoying part is those wontons. They're hard to work with and tear easily. Next time, I think I'll serve it over some angel-hair pasta--same taste and much easier.

We really enjoyed this receipe. I also added some cilantro and would do so again. The only trouble I had was with the won-ton wrappers -- a little oil in the water made them easier to handle. We will definitely be making this one again.

Actually 3-1/2 forks. I have been looking for some inspiration lately in cuisine and found it here. This was a great east meets west recipe and I will definitely make this again. We are big cilantro fans and used cilantro for garnish ..could use some red color in it for drama, I think I will incorporate tomato or red pepper somehow next time..

I thought this was a great recipe. My only wish is that I had had teflon-hands to work with the won ton skins after draining them! I also added some roasted red & yellow pepper to the shrimp mixture. I substituted green onions for the shallots (since I was out) and garnished with a sprinkling of cilantro. Very yummy.

All I can say is that it tickles the tase buds and that is a tough thing to do..

Different looking and tasting dish. Sauce has tremendous flavor and combines well with the other ingredients.
