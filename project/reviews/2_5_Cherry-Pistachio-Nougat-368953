I followed the recipe exactly -- well except for the rice paper. It came out perfectly and I've been asked to make some more for this Christmas.

I agree with all the disappointed on this one. It turned into a gooey, too sweet, too honey taste mess. Despite using rice paper it glued itself on to the plate I served a variety of goodies on. No one ate it but the rest of my confections disappeared in a flash. Will not make again.

I made several batches of this recipie last year for Christmass gifts and plan on making it again. The one change I made was I used salted pistachios and sour cherries to ensure a good sweet/salty mix

I did not have the problems that others did with the recipe. I made it over the holidays because my father loves torrone and the cherry and pistachio combo sounded amazing. It was my first time making nougat and I found the process interesting/mildly scary. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked the sugar/honey mixture to 252 degrees. I was a bit worried when, after 10 minutes of mixing, the nougat didn't quite triple in size, but it was the perfect consistency and totally delicious! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great minus one change - you need to cook the sugar to a higher temp. 265-270 worked perfect for me. The first time I made them they got gooey after 24 hours. Withe the higher temp, the cookies held their shape for 4 days (now they are all eaten). Thought the flavor was great too.

I can usually count on epicurious and Bon Appetit recipes to be on target but this one was a bomb. I love nougat and was really excited about the cherry pistachio combo. So I was disappointed to end up with a pan of marshmallow fluff.

This was super easy to make and be aware that it is very, very sweet. Not my kind of thing but a Persian friend gave me top marks for making this candy and it certainly is festive with the green pistachio and dried cherry. I did not use rice paper, I used parchment and everything worked out great, even though I forgot to oil or spritz the parchment with cooking spray.

REALLY wish I would have checked the reviews before starting to make these - yup, something is wrong with this recipe. I just finished them and was excited to start cutting them and putting them alongside the rest of my Christmas cookie spread but no - these are just mush, not nougat. I agree that the concept is great, but the consistency is all wrong.

This recipe looked interesting and so did the use of the rice paper. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I re-read it several times to make sure I followed the steps. My result was similar to others - a nougat that did not set well and remained way too sticky. I eventually froze the nougat, then cut and handled it frozen, wrapping each piece in lightly oil sprayed foil. It was a lot of effort for a below average finished product.

This recipe has waaaay too much honey in it. When I made it, I thought it was a but much, but I always try to follow the recipe as closely as possible the first time I make something. However, this nougat stays very loose. My theory is this: honey is an invert sugar. Small amounts of invert sugar are added to caramels to keep them from crystalizing. However, if you add too much, you'll end up with a liquid syrup. This recipe added extra honey for flavoring, but I'm sure that they tested the amount of it exactly. As a result, the nougat does not harden. Instead, it's far closer to a marshmallow. But, I love making marshmallows. The process of adding hot sugar syrup to egg whites is fun, and I hope to find a more successful recipe. Thank goodness I have a 1950's Joy of Cooking, complete with nougat recipe. I'll try that next time.

1 Fork due to the fact it is nougat (who doesn't like nougat?), but this recipe turned into toothpaste the next day. Cherry/pistachio is a good combo, but nougat is a bit bland. I will add vanilla to next batch. I cooked the second batch to 275 F, and it was still gooey. 252 isn't even close tot he right temp. I am going to review my other nougat recipes for better technique.

This recipe turned out perfectly for me. I cooked the sugar mixture to about 257 degrees, rather than 252, but not on purpose. Maybe that made a difference. It is soft, but was easy to cut and tastes wonderful. I did use salted pistachios.

Well I'm glad I'm not the only one who had trouble. Not sure I would call this nougat. Made twice thinking something went wrong the first time. Followed exactly as written and turned out like some industrial paste both times.

I agree. I was so disappointed. I was very careful with my measurements and temperatures. I even tried to bake it after the fact to see if I could get it to dry out. But it is now in the freezer in one big clump waiting for inspiration to hit.

Something is seriously wrong with this recipe - I believe the sugar syrup should be cooked to a much higher temperature (closer to 300F or hard crack stage). The mixture tastes fine, but is a sticky uncuttable mess. Very dissapointing.
