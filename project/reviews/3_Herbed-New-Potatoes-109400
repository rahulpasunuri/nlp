Potatoes are a versatile ingredient and garlic makes everything better. I used four cloves and three stalks of green onion. Next time I'll scale back on garlic by one clove. Otherwise, used fresh basil, dried chives and parsley, and thought it was awesome. Easy recipe that is readily adjustable to whatever you have on hand.

Very good with my garden fresh herbs: parsley, sage, oregano, and rosemary. Used red potatoes as New was not available.

This is an excellent & easy to prepare recipe for fresh new potatoes. Yummy, is all I can say. My husband absolutely loves the way the potatoes taste. We think it has to do with the taste of the olive oil. Have made this about 3x in the past month.

it looks like most people just add extra herbs and it is good so i will try it and see how i like it!! it sounds good but it helps if u like them ( which i do)!!

I thought this dish was way too bland, but since I love new potatoes, I will give it another shot. I will add more herbs and garlic.

really good potatoes! What did I do wrong though to cause the mixture of oil, garlic, and herbs to burn to the bottom of the pan? Was the flame too high on my burner? Either way, it was delicious. my husband gobbled these up!

The dish is tasty and light. I added extra herbs to give it more kick. My guests asked for the recipe, so I guess they liked it, too.

Gosh these were so good! Very easy prep too! Couldn't get chives so I used scallions that I chopped very finely.
