To the reviewer who asked about an easier way to peel beets: wrap your beets in foil to roast and the skin will fall right off!

This is a delicious salad and use of roasted beets. I used clementines for the juice and peel, plus I substituted with white balsamic vinegar. It was perfect.

Delicious and super easy. I also added some additional orange juice and sugar to the dressing to reduce the tartness. I did not make any adjustments to the walnuts and really didn't think it was necessary.

The second time I made this I used a different goat cheese that was also recommended but from a different market. It was a tad salty and not nearly as good with this salad as the first which will sweet and smooth.

Made this for New Year's. Excellent salad with roast. Everyone loved it! Easy to make and prepare since all the work can be done the day before. Did add about 2 - 3 tbsp of orange juice extra. Also I used Feta instead, just because I don't like goat cheese as a topping. Add about 1/2 a english cucumber peeled and diced. Also added some spinach, and romaine to the lettuce mix. After reading the reviews of others, I still would not make the nuts candied since I found the dressing sweet enough.

Fabulous salad! I went top of the line with all ingredients; the best olive oil, fresh sqeezed orange juice and a fine local goat cheese recommended by the cheese experts at my local market. Peeling roasted beets is a challenge. Anybody have some advice here? That was the most time consuming part of the recipe. I did the beets, the candied walnuts (recipe from this site) and dressing the night before. Note: I added an extra tablespoon of orange juice and sugar to taste (about a tsp.) My husband, who doesn't even like beets, loved this salad as did all my guests. Delectable!

Rather than a wintertime dish, it is a summertime tradition to use our first home-grown beets of the year for this recipe. We tend to use regular salad greens from the garden as well. Such a nice combination of mellow earthy sweet and tangy, and a nice crunch from the walnuts. Highly recommended.

Easy to make, pretty and tasty.

This went over well at our family Christmas gathering. Ended up adding extra clementine juice (instead of orange) to the dressing because it was a bit too tangy. Used a delicious locatelli romano, its saltiness was perfect with the sweet beets and tart dressing.

I agree with some other reviewers - the dressing was too tart. I made it exactly as printed. Time to move on to other salads.....

With the changes of adding candied pecans instead of walnuts, and adding 1/2 again as much OJ to the dressing, this was delicious.

Delightful salad! I served this for a 2nd course at my Christmas dinner with a couple of alterations: I substituted sherry vinegar, was generous with the orange peel, used fresh clementine orange juice and added a little raw sugar to take ease the citrus edge just a bit. Very easy and quick, especially if you make the dressing and roasted beets the day before.

Wonderful! Heeding the advice of other reviewers, I used freshly-squeezed OJ and substituted sherry wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar and it was absolutely wonderful! Used fresh goat cheese with herbes de provence, which was very soft and tossed in with salad and everything got creamy and messy and oh-so-tasty. My personal preference was for pecans instead of walnuts and it worked too. But when roasting the beets, add a tablespoon of olive oil.

I've made this recipe twice for large groups and it was well received both times. So many people love the fresh beets. And the beets-goat cheese combo is divine.

This is a recipe I would not hesitate to make again. I used freshly squeezed oranges for the juice and a little sugar to taste. We used candied pecans instead of walnuts and also peeled and cut the beets into wedges before roasting them. It was a big hit at our dinner party.

Excellent salad! Used sherry vinegar instead of white. It was a bit tart for me, so I added an extra tablespoon of OJ to the dressing (and a small pinch of salt). That did the trick. I also used grated orange peel instead of the thin strips, and candied pecans from Trader Joe's. Split two ways, it makes a wonderful light dinner. This is now my favorite beet & mixed green salad recipe.

I used toasted pecans instead of the walnuts, but otherwise loved the salad. Used very high quality and fresh ingredients - beets, cheese, pecans, olive oil, etc.. Delicious!

Have made it for guests on multiple occasions with rave reviews! Some suggestions for simplification only: candied walnuts are great, but raw walnuts works just as well. In addition, I made a simple balsamic vinagrette in lieu of the dressing. I used fig balsamic vinegar which added the sweetness of the orange and was a delicate touch to the other ingredients. I don't alwasy have the patience or time to zest oranges.

You get out of this salad exactly what you put into it. If you use fresh organic beets, roasted to perfection the night before, excellent, gourmet white wine vinegar and imported chilled goat cheese, if you use fresh organge juice to cut the tartness of the vinegar... if you follow the directions exactly, down to the last thin slices of organge peel and the ingredients are at room temperature as they suggest, you will have the most delicious salad in the entire world. Every word in this receipt is there for a good reason. Follow it to the letter and the result is perfection! Canned beets are a joke!

This was good, but not a WOW salad. I will make it again, but will used canned beets (didn't think cooking them myself added any flavor), and I would use candied walnuts. Unlike other reviews, I didn't think it was too tart or too much vinegar.

I found this recipe to be disappointing. It sounded delicious but not as flavorful as I hoped.

Rating: 2
I "thinned out" the vinaigrette by adding more oil in reaction to those that said the salad was to vinegary (also, a "normal" vinaigrette is NOT one part oil to one part vinegar - it's more like 3 to 1 - and the OJ would count as vinegar to some degree). I also added fresh orange slices instead of the peel. I don't know, but there was just something missing here. More salt and pepper, maybe?

This was a big hit at my dinner party. It was nice to be able to do many parts early too. I bought pre-washed mixed greens so it was incredibly easy to assemble. I would definitely make it again and can't think of what I might change other than trying it with candied walnuts which I've had in restaurants.

Not bad, but I was a bit disappointed. I expected a more flavorful salad. On this site, there are better salads. The white wine vinegar might have overpowered the other ingredients. The search continues.

Made this for our wine and gourmet food club's 2/16 dinner. I used mini cookie cutter to cut out hearts from the roasted beet slices for out Valentine's theme -- they were a fun surprise in the salad portions, reminding everyone of the Valentines they rec'd long ago. The dressing was low enough in acid that it didn't detract from the wine flight with which it was served, and it proved to be a perfect dish for the meal and "holiday."

This salad was teriffic.. I made it just as the recipe said and it was a huge hit at my dinner party. It followed a Rack of Lamb dish and was a perfect complement.

I used the tip of adding oranges to the salad, except I used segments of 2 blood oranges that I found at the local specialty produce store. If I made this again with the oranges, I would probably omit or cut back on the grated orange peel--it almost became overwhelmingly citrus-y. Overall, very good and pretty simple for how elegantly it can be presented. The beets and the goat cheese complement each other perfectly and contrast with the frisee very well.

My friends raved about the salad. They suggested one improvement -mandarin oranges

I made this for my husband and I and he doesn't like beets! I just put the beets on my half and we both loved the salad. The dressing really picks up the orange flavor for something a little different.
