Although not spectacular, this was a delicious light dessert after a heavy brisket dinner. At dinner we had bread, potatoes, brussel sprouts, meat, y'know, the usual Sunday cook up type of stuff. When I brought this out to the table, people were eager to have "just a little something sweet" to top off the meal. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I'm also loving the leftovers as a late night TV watching snack.

This was just o.k. I would not make it again and I deleted it from my file.

Simply lovely. And so easy to make! I didn't have Earl Grey; just English Breakfast, but I sense that doesn't make a huge difference. Wonderfully subtle flavor! I served it on its own, as a compote, but I imagine it would be lovely over ice cream or frozen yoghurt or mascarpone. It was a great success!

This was fabulous! When navel oranges are plentiful, it will be our favorite dessert. Good for company, or for anytime. I'll always make sure to have the Earl Gray tea on hand.

I tested this as an alternative Thansgiving dessert for my vegan brother. My husband and I loved it and can't get enough. It is great with pancakes, ice cream, tofutti, or jst alone. We substituted dried apricots for the prunes with a nice result.

Loved this. We also served this on leftover fried crepes with creme fraiche and crumbled toasted walnuts

Sounds weird, I know, but it is absolutely delish -- especially served with excellent quality vanilla ice cream, because of the cardamom/orange/tea flavored syrup. A good recipe to satisfy your sweet craving, but lighter than most other desserts.
