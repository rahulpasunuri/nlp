Well, I didn't exactly follow this recipe. After reading the various chimichurri debates (cilantro/no cilantro; red Vs white vinegar vs. lemon juice, etc) I decided to make a sauce of equal parts fresh parsley and fresh cilatro, tons of garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Blended all to a fairly smooth paste in the blender, and used this to accompany grilled grouper. FANTASTIC! The sauce was also great on the oven-roasted potato wedges I prepared as a side. Grilled red & green bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms rounded out the meal. We had so much sauce left over that we decided to re-purpose it, and I have chicken breasts marinating in it as I type.
