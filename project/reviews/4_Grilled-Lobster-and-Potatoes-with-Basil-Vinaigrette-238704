We served this last night to a group of friends that we wanted to treat to a special dinner. (cost of lobster is just a bit out of our range for less special events) Oddly enough the potatoes turned out to be the real star of the dinner. I will use that part of the recipe frequently! We also killed the lobsters and cooked them on the grill like is shown on the Fine Cooking website, soooo thankful for a husband that is not squimish about that kind of stuff.

Cooked this with some friends in Maine the other night. I'm from Texas, and we had eaten lobster about every way it could be boiled for three days but decided to go ahead and do it one more time. I did this recipe almost exactly as it called for, but substituted cilantro for the basil on one batch and thought the taste was a lot more impressive. The basil was also good, but the cilantro really seemed to tame the richness in the meat. I also substituted a diced habanero for the crushed red pepper by choice, and it was fantastic. Since the potatoes were so small I put them cut side down on a piece of foil with some olive oil, salt, and pepper and that seemed to keep them from falling between the cracks in my grill. I also added a small filet with this, and the vinaigrette almost tasted like a chimachurra sauce on the meat. Turns it in to "the best surf and turf I've ever had" according to my 85 year-old uncle and the rest of my family.

My friends and I made this exactly according to recipe with lobsters from the Brooklyn Pound- a great place for New Yorkers! Just a warning, when you're cutting the lobsters in half it is VERY juicy!!! lots of splatter. But the turnout was exceptional. A friend made some corn chowder which was an awesome compliment. I loved the basil as I've never had with lobster before. make sure to have lots of good bread to soak up the juices!

Grilling the lobster just adds so much to the flavor...If you've never grilled one, give it a try -- it's definately worth the extra effort
