This is the best cornbread that I have ever had, hands down. It was perfect! I used white cornmeal and it wasn't too dry, not too moist. Definitely not sweet, like most of us Southerners prefer. Even my boyfriend, that doesn't care for cornbread, said it was good. Very very pleased with this recipe.

This is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very well - moist but not too much butter. The essentials for success are to use a cast iron frying pan, to brown the butter, to use very fine cornmeal (as you would for polenta) and to make sure your oven is fully pre-heated before you start.

Made as written. Extremely bland and not worth eating. There are much better recipes for relatively unsweetened cornbread!

I played around with the recipe a bit. Used coarse cornmeal and ran half a cup of it through my spice mill to give a fine/gritty texture. Used maple syrup in lieu of sugar. 1 cup of buttermilk and 3/4 cup of yogurt. YUM!!! The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks is that it's too much butter. I would cut back 1-2 Tbls. I like buttery, but found it too greasy. Put it on parchment paper between the bread and the plate. But the technique is terrific and cooking it in an iron cast skillet is THE way to get the edges crispy and evenly baked.

I made this for a friend with a gluten allergy, and it was a huge success! I used 1/2 cup of buttermilk and milk and plain fat free yogurt for the rest, and used maple syrup instead of sugar. It turned out of the pan beautifully after about 15 minutes and was so easy to make. I served it for breakfast with Strawberry Syrup (Bon Appetit, June 2007) and the recipe was requested by all.

I thought this was an excellent recipe for homemade cornbread. It tasted like my grandma's that she always used to make. In the past, I've only made Jiffy boxed cornbread which always comes out so crumbly & dry. This recipe was plenty moist. My guests loved it! I served it alongside grilled salmon & a lettuce salad.

The bread turned out quite well, but I had to remove it from the oven after only 20 minutes,as it was already quite brown on the bottom and along the edges. I also added one cob of fresh corn kernels for some added texture and interest. I used stone ground corn meal, but next time would use a mixture of fine corn flour and corn meal for a softer consistency.

I've used my cast iron for baking traditional cornbread with wheat flour and more sugar very successfully in the past. This recipe turned out greasy cornbread that stuck more than usual in the skillet. I used coarse cornmeal, which made the bread chewy in an unpleasant way. I thought it tasted a bit too eggy as well.

Pretty good cornbread for stuffing, and I would use it as a topping. I'm not sure you really need 1/4 cup of butter, could probably cut that down a little, but defintely will use again.

Unusual and delicious! I used superfine cornmeal (probably not stone-ground) so it the bread was very soft, very moist, and fairly dense. Not sweet at all. I'm always looking for new ways to use my cast-iron skillet, and this technique will surely become a new standard: the browned butter deepened the flavor of the cornbread, and the hot pan ensured a perfectly crisp crust.

Loved it... I added some Jalapeno Havarti Cheese and that sent it over the top.. had it at a guys BBQ night and it was a huge hit.

This isn't my favorite cornbread recipe, but I like the technique. I used it for stuffing and it worked pretty well. I never have buttermilk on hand, so I use a mixture of yogurt and low fat milk, which made it really very moist. I'd keep using this recipe for the corresponding stuffing recipe, but that's probably all.

This is a good recipe for people who need gluten-free food. It is a little dry which might make it good for stuffing. To eat in lieu of bread with a meal, it needs additional moisture.

Very light for an all cornmeal recipe. Will be using it in the accompanying dressing recipe for Thanksgiving.
