Wicked good! Even my overly critical mother liked them!

I grated both kinds of potatoes coarsely and did not have trouble getting the cakes to cook through. I did have difficulty regulating the amount of oil to cook them. I put the 2 T. oil in the pan for the first batch, and the first three cakes came out greasy with no oil left for the remaining potato mixture. A second time I would parcel the oil out more carefully. I did not form them into balls, but spooned 1/4cup of the potatoe mixture directly into the pan and pressed to shape. As a result mine had lacey edges but they held together well. I did not want to cook fresh pineapple and mango, so I made a salsa instead. I put a teaspoon of white vinegar in a small bowl and added 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, cumin, and black pepper. In retrospect, I would add the cilantro to the salsa and not to the potato mixture. After all these changes, I thought the results were fine but not spectacular. Mine tasted like fresh pineapple and cumin; I could barely taste the sweet potatoes.

As recommended by other reviewers, I used a fine grate for the sweet potatoes (used only sweet potatoes) and didn't have a problem with them cooking all the way through or falling apart. I also pressed the pancakes to about 1/4" thickness and used around 3T of batter per pancake. Decreased the salt to 3/4 tsp and they still seemed a little salty. Even though I really like Greek-style yogurt, I didn't think it added anything special; plain regular yogurt or sour cream works just as well. I made 1.5 recipes and next time would maybe wring out the potatoes in two batches (in two different kitchen towels) to get more moisture out. Used my own canned mango chutney. Next time would try one sweet & one russet and would only make a single recipe as 1.5 made quite a lot of pancakes = more time than I'd like at the griddle. These were good...not sure if they were good enough to make again, though. They would make a fun appetizer.

I made these cakes for dinner and my husband and I really enjoyed them. I used two sweet potatoes and grated them using the smaller option on the grater; I think it helped to allow the cakes to cook all the way through quickly. We cheated and used Trader Joe's mango chutney. In all, it was a tasty dinner that was quick to put together.

This recipe was a big hit when served with thanksgiving dinner. it was good to bring the tradition of having sweet potatoes without the marshmallow brown sugar nightmare. The chutney was delicious, and I went easy on the curry spice. The only thing I would do differently is add a little egg and chill the patties. Mine completely fell apart in the fryer and I defaulted to just serving it like a hash brown.

These were delicious and not hard to make. I used less than 1/2 cup sugar and the chutney was very good (sweet enough). The recipe says it makes 8 cakes using scant 1/4 cup for each. I got at least 15 cakes using that measurement. I wouldn't want larger ones because they would probably be hard to handle without breaking. A hit at my potluck event.

The chutney is the best part of this recipe. Just make sure you portion out your potato cakes small enough to cook them all the way through without burning the top and bottom. I made mine a liitle too big, had to finish them in the oven. Very good overall!

Came out excellent! I was short a few of the ingredients (fresh pineapple/mango/Cilantro). Made the chutney with a can of crushed pineapple and apple cider vinegar instead. For the cakes I coated them in panko bread crumbs. They were wonderful.

A must. The grating gets a bit tiresome, but wow - I want these everyday. I live on Maui and we get fresh pineapples and mangoes when they are in season - so the chutney needed no added sugar.

this chutney recipe is awesome as an acompaniment to any white meat. Chicken, pork tenderloin, turkey. I used less sugar than called for, no cumin seeds, and added cayenne. perfect on the meat and a side green salad with strawberry vinegarette!

I like the recipe in the first go. I am from India & most of the recipe I read have ingredients which are not available in my city. But this was quite interesting & exciting (my mouth started watering) with all ingredients available.Thanks.

Loved them! Unexpected flavours, unique, but delicious altogether.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the flavors were unique and delicious. I used two sweet potatoes instead of the russet (because it's what I had) and was happy with the results. My only other sub was 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2, and I'm glad I did because the chutney was still a touch sweet for me. All in all, a little putzy but with yummy results.

I liked these, but my husband thought the curry in the cakes was a little overwhelming. The chutney was great, will use the leftovers with shrimp.

I made these tonight for my family and they were well received. The only change I made was to omit the cumin seeds because I didn't have any. The chutney was a little sweeter than I like so next time I'd half the sugar.
