I used this as a base for an idea I had in my head. I used 1 1/2 lbs ground chuck and 1/2 lb of Mexican chorizo. I used frozen corn and chopped up pickled jalapenos instead of a green pepper. I also added a can of black beans and seasoned with chili powder and cumin. I made the meat mixture in a large cast iron pan and spread the corn bread batter on top. Then put the whole thing in the over. I made the corn bread batter from scratch and sprinkled shredded cheese on top after I took it out of the oven. I didn't used fritos, but they would have been tasty if I had. This was really good comfort food and everyone LOVED it!

This is a serious comfort food for any child of the 50s-70s. Having a rough week, I knew I wanted this childhood dish, but not quite so...nasty...as the latter-day versions. Corn chips on the bottom of the casserole, a variety of ground pork/pork sausage instead of chuck, and plenty of Siracha(tm) and sour cream as condiments made our 12-year-old + 40-somethings happy campers!

I made a vegetarian version by using Hormel vegetarian chili and mixed it with cheddar cheese, sliced green onions, sliced black olives, half a can of Mexicorn, cumin and chili powder. I crushed tortilla chips in the bottom of a pyrex dish and spooned the chili mixture on top. For the topping I mixed one package of Jiffy cornbread mix with one egg, the other half of the Mexicorn, a handful of cheddar cheese and enough milk to make it runny. I baked it at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. Garnish with sliced black olives and sour cream. YUM! This is a great way to make a vegetarian dish that all can enjoy.

This is classic 1950's era tamale pie. My mother used to make this for us growing up as kids in the 1980's. It is tasty, but does not taste like tamales. People expecting tamales should look elsewhere. I upped the amount of chili powder and put in about double the amount of garlic. I also used about 1/4 cup of Masa in the sauce itself, which adds a bit more corn flavor to the dish.

I used ground pork and Rotel diced toms w/grn chiles instead and it was awesome!! My boyfriend wants this to be a regular in the meal plan. Very easy to make, and nice balance between spicy and sweet cornbread. Doesn't taste like a tamale however so next time I want to try using shredded pork and find a tamale sauce to replace the Tom sauce.

Just made this tonight and my husband went crazy for it! I love it when he does that! I really liked it too and am glad that I took other reviewers suggestions including: putting Fritos on the bottom of the 9x13 dish, adding lots of garlic (4 cloves - could have used more), fresh cilantro and other spices to the meat mixture (chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and a little adobo). I cut back on the corn and just added 1/2 cup frozen to the meat and just (1) 8oz can of tomato paste and (1) can of Rotelle tomatoes with chili peppers. I then mixed up (1) 8.5oz box of Jiffy, with one egg, a little cheese and enough milk to make it runny as the recipe said it should be. Poured it on the meat mixture and didn't know what I would end up with but was very happy with the results. We were very hungry and ate 1/2 of the pan. Would be perfect for 4 hungry people. I'm going to try it with chicken next time.

Hubbie loved, the kids & I weren't so hot on it. It's not a tamale flavor. Not sure why it's so named. It's not bad, it's just that it's not great. If you spend the time, might as well have a great meal.

This recipe I have made for many years. You do need to put the fritos on the bottom of a 9 X 13 baking dish. Be sure to use the whole box of cornbread mix and add a diced jalapeno. Use only one can of the corn with the meat as others have stated. I also prefer the beer to the wine. They don't use wine in cooking in Mexico. Will keep making this for many yers to come.

I concur re only 1 can of corn. As for the Fritos, I put them in the bottom of the casserole, similar to a recipe my grandmother has made for years. Also, used 1 pound chicken chorizo and 1 pound ground turkey to drop the fat but bump the flavor way up.

I loved this dish!it was quick and easy.great for when you want something "different" but dont have a lot of time.i only used one can of mexicorn, and no red wine or olives.I also did not use the fritos( i think that would have ruined it)I will DEFINITELY make it again and again.

I do not add wine but it is fantastic. It is requested all the time for work pot lucks.

I followed the recipe as given, but should have read the reviews first and made the changes other people suggested. It was much too sweet for my taste. The fritos were not a pleasant addition either..

Good Recipe! A substitution of ground turkey reduced some fat and 1 can of mexicorn was enough. I would make it again

Wonderful recipe. I used an entire can of Marie Calender's cornbread mix, with two cans of cream corn, and put jalepenos on one half for the adults. Delicious!

Made this for my brawny guy roommates and it disappeared in a trice. Not highbrow, but tasty. I tweaked the spices a little bit -- added cayenne pepper and cumin and cilantro, and four cloves of garlic -- and used fresh organic corn in place of the canned. The recipe didn't specify the size of the casserole, I made a whole box of Jiffy and it wasn't enough to go all the way to the edges. Next time, will use a box and a half. This would be great with pepper Jack instead of the Cheddar, and with some jalapenos mixed in. Will definitely be making this again.

My familiy really liked this. To cut down on clean-up, I used a large cast iron skillet and baked the "pie" in the same pan I used to prep the dish. I did spray a little pam around the edges before I poured the corn bread topping on. I also used a jar of ancho chille taco sauce in lieu of one of the cans of tomato sauce. Otherwise, used beer and a little more garlic...and I was DELISH! Even my picky three year old ate some!

This got rave reviews from firefighters who ate it, but a few less from the cook. Garlic: use "to taste": I used 5-6 minced cloves, but could have used more. The 1/2 recipe of the corn bread mix only works if you are using (as I did) a standard cassarole sized dish, but a standard dish is too small, and now I have to clean the oven. Next time it will be a 9x13 inch dish and the full Jiffy mix for the topping. Skipped the Fritos and didn't miss them. I also followed another reviewer's advice, and added one chopped jalapeno pepper and substituted beer for the wine. Next time I will use two peppers and stick with the beer. It fed 4 hungry adults (and would only feed 8 if no one is all that hungry -- all firefighters are always hungry!) It should double and triple well and suspect it would freeze just fine without the topping, which could be added just before baking. Absolutely needs a side salad (boston lettuce with mandrin oranges and balsamic vinegrette works well). It was a hit, though, and will go into the station house repetoire.

Good beginning but recipe definately needs some help. Added 2 chopped fresh jalepenos and 2 large garlic cloves minced to the saute. Substituted 14 oz can of diced tomatoes w/mild chili peppers for tomato sauce, 1 package frozen corn for canned Mexicorn and used beer instead of red wine. Doubled the chili powder and added some cumin. Added more cheese to topping and used crushed tortilla chips mixed with grated cheddar instead of Fritos. Delish with the changes. This is a good recipe to experiment with.

excellent! I added mexican spices, I also doubled the crust.

Excellent family pleasing meal. Also great for potlucks! The crust WAS sweet, so I might make it with regular corn instead of creamed next time. I doubled the crust recipie as I like mine a little thicker. Highly reccommended!

This has become a family favorite for us. I have been asked for this recipe more than any other! It isn't quick, but it is easy and delicious. I serve with Sour Cream and hot sauce.

I gave this recipe 3 forks mainly on potential. Instead of meat, I used grilled boneless skinless chicken breast maranited in lime juice, olive oil, chili powder and some other mexican spices, then shredded it into the pan. I also added black beans. Lastly I grilled the pepper whole, diced it up and threw it in the pan. It gave it a little more authentic mexican zing. A World Class Meal.

Rating: 3
I actually considered giving this four forks. It's extremely yummy. No wine and some chili pepper and cumin make for the only changes to a delicious dish. I've made this for all my friends and it's a winner. Easy to make, and it freezes well too (although the topping isn't as crisp as fresh made). I highly recommend this.

My sis and I had to throw this out. Never had tamale pie before, but the topping was way sweet and the filling bland (only change: no wine). Presents nicely as a comfort food dish, but only for someone w/ a sweet tooth.

I felt there was too much mexi-corn, so I would only use one can next time. I used finely crushed tortilla chips rather than fritos. Otherwise, this was a great recipe.

I used leftover Rustic Chili to make this recipe. I used a 8 1/2 oz. box of Jiffy cornbread mix with the corn, cheese and egg. I used Tostitos tortilla chips instead of Fritos. The topping is sweet, but once I got used to it, I liked it a lot. It was a great way to do something different with leftover chili.

Very tasty, added some red pepper flakes to the filling to spice it up. Also added some of the cheese to the filling for thickening. Great weeknight dish.

I substituted ground turkey and added cumin. I heeded the warnings and backed off on the wine. I used all the cornbread mix, a whole can of creamed corn and a mixture of extra sharp cheddar and pepper-jack cheese. This was extremely easy, healthy, tasty, and filling. I was completely satisfied.

I like spicy so added 1-2 tsp of ground cumin seed, a little extra chile powder, more of jack and cheddar cheese to both the inside and the topping, used the whole box of cornbread mix,and the egg to the topping, and of course as much chips as you like. Came out fantastic...Just like mom would cook ;-)

loved this dish and so did my guests. I subst. 1 can of tom/jalapena for 1 can tom. sauce. Added hot taco sauce (2 T), used the whole corn bread mix w/more cream corn, cheese and milk and added a mix of cheddar and jack pepper cheese on top. No Fritos. I also added cumin. It made 2 casseroles.

I thought this was very good, it made a large amount. It was easy to make although I used the whole box of corn muffin mix for the top. This would be good for a party. I took left overs for my co-workers and they liked it too.

This is a great basic tamale pie recipe. But it is too sweet--mostly, I think, due to the wine. Next time I plan to substitute diced tomatoes with juices for the wine, and add a lot more seasoning to the ground beef. I think the topping is terrific; its the meat mixture that needs to be punched up.

Rating: 2
I wasn't too crazy about this one! The red wine and corn bread gave the dish a sweet flavor that I didn't care for.

A very good dish. The ground beef needs additional spices. I used fresh cilantro, mexican oregano, cayenne. I also substituted 8 oz of Rotel tomatoes for 8 0z. of tomato sauce The cornbread topping is too sweet.

I have tried this both ways, mexicorn and regular corn, my family enjoys the mexicorn. It gives this dish a nice "different" flavor than the usual tamale pie we were used to having. However, I do omit the corn chips on top but add the extra cheese and olives. To cut back on the fat content, I use half ground turkey meat and half lean ground beef. I would recommend this dish and plan on serving it often.

I've had this several times and love it. Richmond VA was right about the mexicorn. Regular corn works better. Jiffy does make a cornbread mix. I buy it all the time.

I love the idea of tamale pie and this one seemed perfect. The mexicorn was WAY too sweet for me, as was also the creamed corn in the topping. I would make this recipe again, but use frozen corn that I seasoned in a more savory way. I also used an entire package of corn bread mix, but perhaps this was because I had to substitute another brand for Jiffy. There are a lot of Jiffy muffin mixes, but I know they are all sweet and no corn bread mix! The other thing I would do differently is not use 80% lean beef [ the fattiest I could get at the store.] I think the fat would help the meat to brown. I look forward to making this again and have it taste more savory instead of sweet. Thank you for the recipe!
