I don't see what there was to like about this. Total waste of the ingredients! It was bland and boring. The smell nauseated my boyfriend. He couldn't even be in the same room as it without plugging his nose. This is the worst thing I've ever made from this site, maybe the worst thing ever.

I made this last night and my husband loved it! Although I added a few things of my own. I put a little bit of white wine on the bottom of the pan it bakes in, some fresh tomatoes, red and yellow bell-peppers, sautéed mushrooms with garlic, and sun dried tomatoes. Then I seasoned the chicken, and poured the juice from the artichoke hearts and sun-dried tomatoes on it, covered it with all the veggies, popped it in the oven at 325 and let it cook for about 45 minutes. The result was fantastic, the chicken was moist and the veggies were so tasty!

Absolutely vile. Flavorless, even with addition of almost a pound of blended Italian cheeses. Chicken was dry and rubbery. I think it is simply impossible to bake boneless chicken breasts in the oven without disasterous results. If you compare this recipe to the Opulent Chicken recipe, you wil note that the Opulent Chicken calls for chicken breasts with skin and bones. This recipe doesn't specify that the chicken should have skin and bones. But if you read the recipe carefully, it states that chicken should be placed skin side up, which makes me think that it is calling for chicken with skin and bones. This recipe was so utterly disgusting that I'm reconsidering my subscription.

This was very disappointing, so bland! My husband said he liked it; but when I asked him if he'd like to take it to work tomorrow for dinner, he said, "Let me think about it." Enough said!!! Yuk!!!!

I frequently serve this as a company dish because I can enjoy my guests and appetizers while it bakes. It also happens to be tasty and looks like more work than it really is ;)

Don't know what all the fuss is about. OK at best, took to long to cook, chicken moist at first but then dried out quickly. If there was absolutely nothing else in the fridge....

Favorite, Quick, Standby Dinner Recipe! DELICIOUS with added ingredients: I frequently use this recipe for quick week day dinners & simple, quick main dish for small dinner gatherings with friends. To add more flavor to the dish and give it a more rustic, bistro fare, I add: + Sun Dried Tomatoes, sliced - those from a jar,soaked in olive oil, + 1 - 2 TB of capers, + 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sliced kalamta olives, + 1 TBsp of country dijon mustard in addition to the mushrooms, artichoke hearts, onions. I alternate all these ingredients based on what I have in the pantry. If your guests do not care for artichoke hearts, just delete. We cook at 325 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, being careful to not overcook the chicken. It should be juicy and cooked, but not overcooked and tough. Enjoy -- it is so easy to make, and is fabulous with capers in it and to enjoy with a Riesling or Viognier!

Lost this recipe in my move 6 years ago. So happy to find it.It was always a regular in my chicken recipe file. I added canned diced tomatoes and tarragon. After it was done, I remembered that I also used to add minced garlic. Served with field greens with spiced walnuts and parmasan thinly sliced, brown basmati rice and steamed green beans, this is a fast and easy and tasty, and don't forget pretty on the plate meal for family and guests.

A very simple recipe to make. I added a few additional spices to give more flavor. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. My chicken cooked in the 45 minute time limit. This dish tastes good, however is nothing I would deem special. I would make it again for my family. Not good enough for guests.

I always read everyone's ideas then quirk it to my style. I did 2/3 white wine and added a few drizzles of extra light virgen olive oil. Some garlic powder, chinese 5-spice, a spinkle of chicken granulated boullion,and a dash or two of hot sauce made it nice and flavorful. I also put like 2 tablespoons of hot mustard to thicken up the sauce and fresh sage. Oh yeah... I used marinated mushrooms instead and frozen artichokes because that's what I had. Very tasty!

Rating: 4
Delicious!!! The mushrooms and artichoke marinade give this dish a robust flavor that is anything but bland!! I added one cut-up tomato, taking advise from the previous reviews, and it definitley took a lot longer than 45 minutes -- mine took a little under 2 hours -- but the end result was well worth the wait.

Very good. I reduced the sauce and added 1 Tbl spoon of chicken boullion granules and a little Wondera. The Mrs. loved it!

I thought this was incredibly delicious. I made enough so I'd have leftovers for lunch. In addition to the other ingredients, I sprinkled this with garlic salt and garlic pepper, and topped with feta cheese when I took it out of the oven. I will definitely make this again.

This is a very easy dish to make for your family. Nothing special. I would not serve it for guests. The left over chicken was great sliced and tossed with salad along with the artichoke hearts and mushroom the next day.

I served this for family and they all loved it. I added more artichokes and about 2 cloves of minced garlic to my sauce. It gave it a little more flavor and it was quite delicious! I'll definitely make this one again.

I just graduated college, and this happened to be the first recipe I tried at my first dinner party. It was a complete success! The chicken came out really moist and yummy (despite the fact I forgot to add the sauce until it had been cooking for almost 1/2-hour) and everyone picked the bones clean. It was super-easy to make, and tasted SO GOOD! I had extra sauce left over after cooking (maybe because I didn't add it at the right time?) which was great over rice.

Rating: 3
I also added the canned chopped tomatoes and used the 1/2 c. chicken broth with 3/4 c white wine. Also used skinless chicken breasts and covered while baking to retain moisture in chicken. Quite tasty. I served in individual pasta bowls. The sauce is to die for! If one wants to cheat a litte serve with french bread for dipping!

Following others' advice, I decided to pep this dish up with some stronger flavors and spices. Rosemary was an excellent addition; gave a wonderful aroma while cooking. I also decreased the white wine by 1/3 and in its place added tarragon vinegar to create more pungency. I placed a small pat of butter on each chicken breast before cooking (butter works wonders on just about anything!) Roasted garlic cloves would have made this dish a 4-fork rating. Easy, really quick, great for Friday night after work!

I followed the recipe provided by the previous reader (& added diced tomatoes, can of artichokes & vegetables, chicken broth 1/2 can, plus salt/pepper/chopped onions/garlic) and placed in oven for 1 hour. At the end I sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese and ate it over rice; it turned out great!! My husband and I really enjoyed it. This works as a nice after work meal.

I agree that I wouldn't serve to company- too basic...But, I did like this dish very much. Actually, my husband liked it better than I did. I used diced tomatoes, like other suggested, and served the chicken and sauce over artichoke ravoli.

After reading the reviews, I added some chopped peeled tomatoes, which added some flavor. But, overall the chicken didn't have enough flavor for me run back to the kitchen and make it again. Too bad, because I love mushrooms & artichokes.

This recipe was excellent. I read all the reviews first and then added to the recipe a can of peeled chopped tomatoes which added quite a bit of flavor. I also minced 4 garlic cloves which I sprinkled on the chicken breasts. I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 3/4 cup of white wine. I used a 32 oz. jar of marinated veggies which included artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, red pepper and little corns and I used 12 oz. of mushrooms, sliced and the green onions. I then added some of the marinade to the pan. The chicken was not done in 45 min. 15 minutes more it was perfect. Served the dish in a bowl and my husband and I loved it. The flavor was wonderful and we are having it again tonight. Should even be better after sitting in the juices all night. I never salt and pepper anything I rather let people do it themselves and this dish didn't need any salt or pepper. Excellent when you play with the basics.

I love mushrooms and artichokes but they added nothing to this recipe as is. It turned out very bland. I like the simplicity the recipe and will try it again with a few changes. I may try sautéing the mushrooms before adding them and maybe introduce some tomatoes. Good recipe but needs a little experimentation.

Not every recipe has to be something 'to write home about' or company fare. I usually have all the ingrediants on hand so it's an easy, quick, under 30 minute meal. I use chicken broth instead of the wine.

nothing to right home about. definitely would not serve to company - though i am sure the other suggestions would help (lemon, tomato, even roasted pepper).

I pulled out a jar of artichoke hearts and after they were open (and I was cutting them up) I realized they were packed in water, not marinade. Since I was already halfway through putting this dish together, I substituted bottled Italian dressing for the marinade and it came out fine. I served this with white rice which tasted good with the sauce and vegetables. This recipe is good, not great; my husband liked it, it was very easy to make. A definite "mid-week" recipe, but not something that I would serve to company.

It was a great dish for throwing something together on the weekday. I will try the suggestions I read about: tarragon, tomatoes, olives, chicken broth and flour. But the best bet might be the "Opulent Chicken" missyb mentioned! Thanks.

I would give this recipe 3 1/2 forks. It's easy to prepare and the ingredients blend beautifully together. I added lemon and used whole mushrooms instead of sliced. Three different sets of dinner parties raved. Will try the tomato addition.

My taste buds must be shot because I thought this dish was boring. Even my husband who eats anything wouldn't touch the leftovers. I know there is something out there with artichokes and chicken that is more interesting than this.

Had a good flavor, though the "juices" were rather thin (I served it over rice). I substituted whole black greek olives (my favorite, and very flavorful) for the green ones and used boneless, skinless breasts.

I have made this a dozen times and I love it - easy for a weeknight meal. The last time I used a jar of SPICY marinated artichokes that I apparently bought by accident. WOW! Even better, try it! I usually serve this with some sauteed spinach with garlic and lemon and some good bread.

This dish was a very simple one to prepare. Simplistic yet refined. the artichoke hearts added a delightful nuance to the harty breast of chicken. We decided not to use the mushrooms because we do not like fungi in our food. Can be prepared in a timely matter.

You're right, Danville, it is a bit bland as written. But if you take the advice of the previous reviewers and add tarragon and tomatoes, it's a very tasty, easy to prepare weekday meal. I use water packed 'chokes and skinless chicken to reduce fat and calories and serve over rice or pasta. The juices are more of broth-like than saucy but that's just fine with me. Yummy!!

the whole family enjoyed this recipe! having read the reviews i *did* change a few things.... like i added 1/2 t. tarragon to the chicken along with plenty of salt & pepper, and dried tomato flakes. also, made the sauce a gravy thickening with 1/8 cup of flour. added another 1/2 t. tarragon at this point, mixed it all up with the mushrooms and artichokes and poured over the individual servings of chicken. next time i'll probably use boneless chicken breasts.

Rating: 1
I also found the sauce to be thin and watery and it would probably be better if cooked much longer than 45 minutes. However,after over an hour, it was getting late and everyone was hungry so we served the chicken, which was fully cooked. I wound up pouring all of the sauce in a saucepan to reduce it, didn't much improve the flavors or consistency. Will keep looking for a better recipe.

Maybe it's just me but I was disapponted. After all the great reviews I made it for friends...added tomatoes, garlic, fresh thyme...but the juices were watery. Ended up thickening them and spicing them up. Hmmmmmm...

Easy delicious recipe. I added plum tomatoes and 2 vine ripened tomatoes. Also added too much tarragon so flavor was way too strong the next day. I liked the addition of thyme and bean sprouts sounds like a good idea. I'll do that next time.

YUMMY! I followed all the previous reviews of adding the diced tomatos (silly me forgot to add the tarragon) and made one other addition...I placed bean sprouts on the bottom of the baking dish...very yummy since the sprouts absorb the liquid on the bottom. Served with pilaf. Next time I will add tarragon and a little less wine (perhaps 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 wine).
