The review below is HYSTERICAL! This sure seems like a lot of trouble for some pickled cabbage, doesn't it (I mean, how good can it really be)? Especially considering you can buy a metric buttload of kimchee for the same amount of time and effort you'll invest in this preparation. BTW, "kombu" is a type of Japanese seaweed used to flavor dishes, not that it matters. :-) MCW
