Good God this is the best stuffing recipe ever! I did omit the liver, and I used prepared bread cubes, and I added an apple, but that's it. I baked it outside of the bird. My husband doesn't care for stuffing, but he had two servings and the leftovers the day after. I made this with a goose for my Austrian in-laws, also not so big on stuffing, but it was a huge hit. I will make this forever!!

Excellent stuffing. I followed the recipe except when wetting the bread: the half and half did not do the trick, I ended up adding at least 2 more cups of liquid (I chose whole milk instead of more cream) an still didn't have any to squeeze out after letting it sit. Also, I like an occasional touch of sweet in my stuffing, so I added a rounded cup of pre-soaked, chopped, dried cranberries. It was great. Next time (and there will absolutely be a next time!) I'll do the same.

Very good recipe, although I made several changes. Used 6 cups of french bread, 2 cups of pumpernickel. Omitted the bacon. Used turkey sausage instead of pork, and used a combination of onions, shallots and leeks. I cooked the sausage and then sauteed the onions and celery. Didn't use liver or cognac. Mixed a quarter cup of cream with 3/4 cup of chicken stock and soaked the bread (there wasn't any "leftover" liquid to squeeze out). Everything else I left the same and the guests loved it. Next time I would probably add some apple or pear to it for some sweetness.

Wow! Takes me right back to Thanksgiving at my mom's 30 years ago. We always made this stuffing. I don't remember my mom soaking the bread cubes in half and half, but I did it this time and the stuffing was incredibly moist. My mom is having Thanksgiving at her house for the first time in 10 years, but not planning to do a sausage stuffing because of too many vegetarians and heart conscious members of the family. So I decided to make it at home yesterday with a roast chicken. So glad I did. It really satisfied my craving for chestnut/sausage stuffing and my husband and 2 sons (even the picky eater one) LOVED it. Makes great leftovers too.

This stuffing was so moist and tasty. Everyone loved it. I would use white wine instead of the brandy, a bit too strong.

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was a hugh hit. This is the best stuffing I've ever eaten. Followed the recipe with the slight variations of using fresh herbs (dried quantity x's 3)and port in place of Cognac .I also roasted my own chestnuts.I did not add the optional liver. Following the make ahead directions I made this 1 day ahead and heated for about 45 minutes before serving.Making this stuffing was labor intensive and took quite a lot of time. Having the ability to prepare it ahead was a huge time saver on Thanksgiving Day and allowed the flavors time to meld,making the stuffing even more flavorful.I will be using this recipe when ever I make stuffing in the future. Try it-You and your guests will be thrilled, it's that good!

Excellent dressing! Everyone loved it. I replaced the half-and-half with vegetable broth and skipped the bacon. Added fresh sage since I had on hand. Increased the broth by another cup and cooked about an hour to get all the flavors to meld together. Remained moist!

This is by far the best dressing recipe. I don't "stuff" the bird any more. I had 17 for T-day dinner and cheated by buying ready made stuffing cubes. I did soak them in the half and half though. I left out the liver but did use cognac and a jar of chestnuts from Williams- Sonoma. It made a large baking dish and my family raved and kept asking, "Who made the stuffing?" all evening! This is very, very good and will be my "go to" stuffing/dressing from now on.

This is the best stuffing I have ever had-And better, thanks to other reviewers. My Changes: " I used 2 packages of Cornbread stuffing mix, so I was able to omit the herbs, except for the parsley. " Omitted the turkey liver " Did not have any brandy and did not seem to miss it. " Since I used the stuffing mix, I did not need to soak the bread in half n half and used half as much. " I used the butter it called for on the stuffing recipe, but will omit it next year, because it did not need it. " Since once of my chief complaints with cornbread stuffing is the dryness, and I dont care if it is browned or not, I only cooked it for the first 20 minutes. It didnt need to cook any more. " The last couple of times I have tried to find fresh chestnuts, the quality was not so good, and I ended up throwing out the moldy chestnuts and substituting. So this year I ordered some dried chestnuts and they were great. This was moist and tasty and unique to any stuffing recipe I have ever tried. I will make it again next year.

Three years ago, I was looking for a recipe similar to my grandma's stuffing and have been making this ever since. We refer to it as the "old heart attack special". We don't pre-cook the sausage and never have a problem with it being dry: just mix it in with all the other ingredients. Grandma used to add a cube of melted butter to the mix, but for my husband's sake, I leave that out.

I definitely added more liquid - also substituted broth for the cream, walnuts for chestnuts, and skipped the bacon entirely but cooked the sausage (turkey) first in the pan so the veggies would soak up some of that flavor. Was AMAZING. need more liquid than the recipe calls for - that was key. I added more after reading reviews about this recipe coming out dry. A little labor intensive, but worth it.

I couldn't find chestnuts so I substituted pecans and I believe it came out better than if I had used chestnuts. Some of the previous reviewers stated that it was dry, but I didn't find it dry at all. Soaking the bread in the cream was something new for me and there was no excess to squeeze out as the recipe states, but it added great flavor. Everyone enjoyed this dish at our table. I don't think it would hurt to add an extra 1/2- 3/4 cups stock or cream to offset the possibility of dryness if your tastes require a bit more moist stuffing.

Wonderful. I subbed the dairy for more chicken stock, bacon for more chicken sausage (prepared the same way as the bacon). The chestnuts were not detected in the end so could probably be omitted.

This was a disappointment. It was sort of dry and went largely ignored. Given the time it took to make and the expense of the ingredients (esp. chestnuts), I will not repeat.

Well, I hate to be the only one writing a bad review but I made this for Thanksgiving and was utterly disappointed. I found it a bit dry and overall thought it was a waste of time and effort for the result.

I made this about 4 years ago and everyone LOVED it. It is now a tradition. I don't put in the liver and I don't think anyone minds.

I made this stuffing for the first time when it came out in 1977 and every year afterwards until I lost it in a move. What a treat to find it again and it's gonna be in our Christmas turkey. Absolutely the best! Use fresh chestnuts. I expect to slim it down just a little this year by using turkey bacon and chicken sausage, but it is definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
I will definitely be making this stuffing again next year, both my son and I really liked it. However, the chestnuts didn't make any sort of impact on the dish and for 9 dollars for a jar, I will ommit them next year and possibly put in some pecans or walnuts instead. A keeper otherwise!

This was the second time that I made this stuffing recipe. It was a hit both times. Neither time did I stuff the bird with it. The family here likes a little "crunch" that the baking in the pan does to the stuffing. It was wonderful flavor and is worth the added labor to create.

Rating: 4
Great recipe; this stuffing was amazing. I used multi grain bread. I also substituted turkey bacon and sausage for the pork. I used fat free half and half, too. If I made it again I would omit the bacon, it is not necessary. Also, I cooked half in the bird and half in a pan. I preferred the pan, my husband and my mom liked the stuffing from in the bird.

I've always thought that stuffing was kind of a silly part of thanksgiving because it never has that much flavor or interest...until this stuffing! This stuffing is wonderful! Two of our guests were lactose intolerant, so we made some of the stuffing with extra chicken broth instead of half and half, and it still turned out splendidly. We also substituted in pecans for the chestnuts -- another wonderful substitution.

So super easy. This was for just me and my husband and I cut everything in thirds. Took 20 minutes to put it all together. Didn't have bacon so I did the sausage first. Added a bit of olive oil and butter for the onions, then added the celery and chestnuts. Deglazed with spiced rum as that is all I had and it gave the chestnuts a nice undertone of flavor. Baked it all in foil and voila - awesome. Did this stuffing with the Deconstructed Turkey also on Epicurious. Best thanksgiving ever.

This is amazing. I am 16, so I haven't really been around long enough to establish serious food traditions at thanksgiving but my family always makes stuffing with apples which I HATE so they put me in charge of stuffing and this is what I made. It is absolutey wonderful and will definately become a tradition. I used rum instead of the cognac and put in some rosemary and chirvil. This is extremely rich and yummy tasting and super easy so when choosing a stuffing recipe, choose this one.

This is our favorite stuffing recipe ! I usually dislike it when people rate recipes as great then proceed to tell how they changed this and that.. But, I must say I never used the half and half and brandy and just use good chicken stock and drizzle the whole mix right in the pan before baking (3 cups probably in total). Comes out fantastic everytime and people fight for leftovers ! Also, much less time consuming that way.

This was a little time consuming to make, but really worth the effort. The stuffing was delicious and I will definitely be making this again.

My family has made variations of sausage stuffing for years. The addition of chestnuts makes this one of my favorites. I roasted my own, which was time consuming and sort of a pain. Other than that, a terrific recipe.

I never liked stuffing until I had this dish - I couldn't keep my fingers out of it! I eye balled everything - I increased the sage and parsley and all of the herbs; the recipe is very forgiving and worked out terrifically!

Really enjoyed this stuffing. I used pancetta instead of bacon which gave a very nice flavor and I dotted the top with butter pieces. I also made it the night before, then baked it while the turkey was "resting" the next day. I was afraid it would dry out but it was still extremely moist and I didn't have to add any broth or other liquid. I like fruit in my stuffings as well so I'm thinking of adding some sautee'd apples next time but honestly, this is a great, simple stuffing as is.

This is the only stuffing recipe I'll ever make! I used two store-bought pkgs. of unseasoned bread stuffing and omitted the liver. Next time - and there WILL be a next time - I will use half the pork sausage. I just don't think it needs that much. I took a "one to four forks" poll around the house and my husband gave it a five.

This is the 3rd Thanksgiving in a row that I've used this stuffing recipe, & although it's outstanding as it, it packs a hefty caloric punch. So to trim it down this time, I used turkey sausage, fat-free half&half & omitted the bacon & liver. And despite all the substitutions, it was still really good.

To Melissa, Don't worry about Salmonella, go ahead and stuff your turkey. I have been eating and stuffing turkeys for 43 years and have never personally known anyone who got Salmonella from stuffing. It turns out moister and more flavorful from being cooked within the bird. Just make sure the turkey is cooked thoroughly and you won't have any problems. Gosh, Americans get so paranoid from watching stupid scary news stories about bacteria on TV, this is so that the agencies don't have to broadcast REAL news. Good luck and happy Thanksgiving toyou.

Bake separately, not stuffed in turkey. Stuffing a turkey is a little risky - it alters the roasting time for the turkey, and if not done right, can lead to samonella.

Fantastic. Earthy, meaty, full of flavor, nice texture. Not too dry, yet the individual components retain some of their shape. you must use good bread and good sausage to do this recipe justice.

Help, this is the first time I am cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Can I stuff this stuffing in the turkey? Or do I have to bake it on the side and if I do stuff it in the turkey do I need to alter the recipe?

Wowser!! Definitely a keeper for next Thxsgiving & anytime we have another bird. Didn't have time to toodle about looking for cooked chestnuts, instead went to the store & bought whole filberts instead & grinded them up in the blender. A great addition in the recipe. The stuffing was almost a meal by its lonesome. Great as a leftover too, but we unfortunately didn't have any. The bowl was licked clean. Enjoy!!

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving and it was a complete hit. I did not add the liver but otherwise followed the recipe. I really love chestnuts and even though I used a whole 14 oz jar from Williams-Sonoma (on sale for $6.99), I would have preferred even more but everyone else said it was good enough.

My family liked this recipe a lot. The texture was different than what we're accustomed to. Williams Sonoma sells a jarred whole chestnut. Certainly easier than roasting and peeling those little guys :-))) By the way, I followed the recipe to a T. Food Saved and froze the dressing, it worked very well when it came to reheating it in the bag.

Wonderful recipe! I got rave reviews even from those who claimed they didn't like stuffing. I caught some of those going back for seconds too. I made it in a separate baking dish instead of stuffing the turkey but I did baste it once with turkey drippings.

couldn't find canned chestnuts soooooo used fresh,after my dear husband shelled them put them in the food processor. Prepared a day ahead and refrigerated so baked it 40 min. covered and 20 uncovered. All eight of us enjoyed. Oh yes, I used my home made county white bread.

My husband and I have been making this stuffing since our first Thanksgiving together in 1982. It is delicious. Use the canned chestnuts--fresh ones are time consuming and a pain. Even our children loved this when they were little! I also make it the day before and bring it to room temp before using it. Enjoy!

WOW!! Awesome recipe! My family loves bread stuffing and this is a hit! And actually easy to prepare. I made it the day before and then brought it to room temperature and baked the next day. Wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.
