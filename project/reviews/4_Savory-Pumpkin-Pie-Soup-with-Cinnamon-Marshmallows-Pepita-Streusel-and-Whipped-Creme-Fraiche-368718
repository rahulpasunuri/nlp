We used 2 quarts of vegetable stock instead of just water for the base (like other reviewers have suggested) and it came out amazing! Wonderfully complex medley of flavors that you wouldn't necessarily think to put together. Also, we used ground allspice instead of whole allspice berries and didn't feel like it was missing anything. Finally, we also used fresh pumpkin that we boiled and pureed instead of canned pumpkin. All told, it took us about 3 hours to make but well worth the effort (we converse a lot though while we cook, maybe a concentrated person wouldn't take so long).

I made the soup twice this week for friends and tweaked the soup recipe each time. Any soup needs a flavorful stock & water is not it. The first time I used canned pumpkin with a store bought chicken stock. The pumpkin soup needed brown sugar and touch of cayenne to fill out the flavors. It was 2 forks. The second time I used a roasted butternut squash with some thai red curry paste. (Since I didn't have any broth, I cooked the veggies in some bacon fat.) Butternut squash has a superb consitency and natural sweetness that works so well in a soup. That was 4 forks. The pepita topping is excellent! The topping would make a nice food gift. I substituted the creme fraiche with mexican sour cream. Next time I will double the topping recipe!

Was inspired to try this recipe after seeing a similar soup on Daniel Boulud's menu (normally I steer clear of anything with marshmallows). The toppings are amazing and make this soup really special. I used Sweet and Sara cinnamon pecan marshmallows to make this recipe vegan (no pork gelatin in these marshmallows) - I did not add any added cinnamon to these marshmallows. The pepita streusel is awesome, I was salted these well to really pop once in the soup. Instead of 2 quarts of water, I used one quart of vegetable broth and one quart of water - I believe it would be way too watery in flavour otherwise. Also, I steeped the spices for 35 minutes rather than 20 minutes to get the full flavour in. My guests all loved this soup!

The toppings for this soup were awesome..... but the soup itself was lacking in any flavor! I will try this soup again and use vegetale broth instead of water and play with the spices.
