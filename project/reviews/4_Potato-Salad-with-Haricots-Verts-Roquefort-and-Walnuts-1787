Used Danish Castello Blue, which melted creamily into the potatoes. Don't skip the haricots verts and walnuts. I left out the rosemary from the dressing because it sounded weird. Made a ton for a cookout, and it disappeared. Epicurious, please put a link to the mustard vinaigrette.

Followed recipe pretty closely. Turned out great. Used gorgonzola instead of Roquefort. Careful - if potatoes are too hot when you put the sauce, sauce may separate.

This is the perfect pairing for roast chicken when you want veggies that are room temp rather than hot. Delicious!

I've made this for years and have found that adding more vinaigrette to the potatoes as they roast greatly enhances their flavor. Just save enough to dress the beans and the finished potatoes.

I was really looking forward to this, and followed the directions almost exactly, but added sweet red pepper which helped it out quite a bit both for flavor and appearance. I was going to serve it at a barbecue but at the last minute the guests had to cancel and I was actually glad that I didn't have to serve it to them because I have so many better potato salad recipes. Deleting it from my box.

This is very tasty, but if you want to make it ahead, I would recommend boiling the potatoes instead of roasting them. Roasted, they get tough if not eaten immediately. The flavors are best if served slightly warm - not just at room temperature. Yum!

This recipe was a huge hit. I added a half cup of bacon pieces, which made it extra indulgent but it was well worth it.

Made this as part of a barbecue menu yesterday. Didn't change a thing. Next time, I may double the green beans. Everybody LOVED it including myself

FYI, the mustard vinaigrette is still available on Epicurious (search on mustard vinaigrette, and it is dated May 1994). This is a wonderful recipe and always a hit when I've served it.

Excellent summer dish especially with fresh haricots verts from the garden. Great served on a buffet and with steak from the grill. Thanks Lisa you got us hooked on this!

Absolutely delicious! I made the vinaigrette exactly as called for - normally I would be quick to follow any suggestion that would allow me to reduce oil/butter etc, but in this case, I thought the amount of oil called for was perfect. I used green beans from my CSA insteead of haricots, which certainly would have been more elegant, and I also tossed everything together in the same bowl. I think the walnuts are what really make this special. Next time, I will double the amount. I also found that the potatoes were ready after being roasted for 30 mins at 375 instead of 50 mins. Enjoy!

I have prepared all- three parts of this chicken/vinaaigreete /salad combinastion many times over the last 10 yrs -- always to great acclaim from others and great satisfaction to MOI. I've even won an award [among friends] for BEST SALAD based on this recipe. It combines all things wonderful -- and even with substitutions like asparagus vs green beans, etc -- It rocks. Ten years later, I am making it for this holiday weekend. A true winner. Wish I could claim it as original.

We loved this recipe! I served it at a barbecue and everyone asked for the recipe. I made it several hours ahead at just kept it on a platter until the party.

Really liked this unusual potato salad but preferred it just after it was made as opposed to cold. Substituted thin asparagus for green beans. Good choice. Used Gorgonzola and this worked well too.

Really good - roasting the potatoes in the vinaigrette produces great results. I do omit the rosemary and sage when making the Mustard Vinaigrette though, because I find the combination of rosemary and roquefort kind of nasty.

I love this recipe. I doubled the amount of potatoes and haricots verts. I sauted the shallots in olive oil before adding them to the dressing. I only used 1/2 c oil for the dressing and used 2/3 c of buttermilk blue cheese for the doubled recipe (my husband isn't a big fan of blue cheese). The blue cheese was very mild this way (I would have liked more flavor). I made this recipe one day ahead and it was great.

This recipe is a must! I also got rave reviews. I used gorgonzola, but took another reviewers advise and cut back on the amount. I also cut down on the amount of rosemary.

The potatoes were to die for until I added the roquefort. The potatoes were still very warm and the cheese melted and overwhelmed the dish. I will try this again with alittle less cheese and wait for the potatoes to cool more.

Used toasted pine nuts and gorganzola because that's what I had - fabulous! Got rave reviews. I'm not sure I would have it any other way.

Very, very good. Hubby and I had it as a main course and we both loved it. Surprising, as Hubby is very fussy about potato salads insisting only the traditional egg, mayo, potato, pickle variety is worthy of the name. The hot potatoes alone would make a great side dish.

Took this to a 4th of July bar-b-que...it was perfect with the ribs, coleslaw, and other traditional dishes. Used baby potatoes and local green beans from the farmers' market. Fabulous!

I've made this dish several times and it always gets rave reviews. Since Roquefort is a rather expensive cheese which I prefer to serve on its own, I often use a cheaper Danish blue which works perfectly well.

I took this to a BBQ and while several guests raved about the presentation, I had a lot left over. (I think there must have been folks who don't like blue cheese). I thought it had a nice flavor and will only try to make it for blue cheese lovers next time.

I made this for July 4th and doubled the recipe, and it's all gone. The roasted potatoes make this salad! I left out the haricots verts and it was still delicious.

This was one of my husband's favorite new dishes. We couldn't stop raving about it! Can't wait to share at picnics this summer. Substitued a good bleu cheese for the Roquefort...vinegarette is outstanding. No complaints at all. A keeper.

Oh my goodness! I was undone over this one. I loved it and everyone in attendance loved it. As the other reviews said, none was left. I actually used Gorgonzola bacause thats what I had. Not the dulce, the mountain (crumbly) Gorgonzola. I will definetly make this again and again

I made this for a picnic over the weekend and never got to taste it, well, except for licking the bowl. So I did it again for dinner Sunday night and can't wait to get to the leftovers. Delicious!

I've made this many times. As one of my friends says, "This would be part of my last meal on earth." It's that good. I usually just use regular green beans (haricots are SO expensive) and have used other types of bleu cheese when I can't find roquefort. The combination of the viniagrette (which is also fantastic as a salad dressing and on roasted chicken) with the cheese and toasted nuts.....YUM! Time consuming but well worth it.

A huge hit at potluck bbqs, even if 5 other people also brought potato salad. Everyone loves it. I just combined everything, rather than arranging beans and potatoes separately, and nobody complains.

The other reviewers all sounded so positive about their experience and the reaction to the recipe and it actually happened to me to! I made this for an outdoor event on Saturday. Sunday afternoon I received an e-mail asking for the recipe! I followed the recipe pretty closely. One guest was impressed that I substituted mustard for mayonnaise in the potato salad as it was an outdoor-in-the-sun event. I guess that's our little secret now!

This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper. Everyone wanted the recipe. I roasted the potatoes just 25 minutes at 450 and they were perfect. They continue cooking a little after you remove them from the oven. I used Oregon Blue Cheese and they were delish!!!!

Love this recipe. I had to use dried herbs, and I ran out of olive oil and filled in with 1/2 cup water. I used stilton, too. I thought it was great. I needed every bit of the suggested roasting time. I did make a double recipe, though. Am taking it to a block party tonight.

I first made this recipe when it was published in Bon Appetit in 1994 and loved it. I was very happy to see the recipe on this website since it is much easier to find than digging through back magazine issues. I have made this recipe at least a dozen times over the years (pot lucks, picnic basket gifts, casual dinners) and have always gotten a tremendous response from friends.

Absolutely delicious! I used Gorgonzola instead of Roquefort and regular old green beans. The mustard vinegrette on the roasted red potatoes was wonderful - definitely better than just olive oil, salt, and rosemary. I chilled the whole dish (including the roasted potatoes) and it was nice cold.

I made this dish for a graduation luncheon buffet and it was the first dish on the table to be devoured. Unlike the one reviewer who thought the Roquefort cheese was a bit overwhelming, I found that a good French Roquefort was the difference between a good and exceptional dish. One caveat: I raosted the potatoes at the higher temp for 20 minutes, but found that 25-30 (not the recommended 50!!) minutes at the lower temp was all that was needed. You may want to check this before your potatoes turn to stones.

We thought this was delicious. Here's what I did a little differently, as I'm not crazy about the 'bite' of raw shallots... I prepared the potatoes the same but as I was short on time, I cooked them at 450 as directed but then 25 minutes at 400. After I quick cooked the green beans, I returned them to the pot after draining and added the vinaigrette. I then cooked the green beans in the vinaigrette to soften the shallots. My husband (who claims he is not a big fan of mustard) ate 3 helpings...

This is a great room temperature dish at any time of the year. It makes a terrific presentation with the potatoes mounded on a platter, and the beans lengthwise around the rim of the dish. When the walnuts and the cheese get added, it is truly spectacular. I also use a milder bleu cheese so as to make it more kid-friendly, and sometimes keep the pieces large enough so that people can avoid it if they want. This is a wonderful company dish, and picnic dish, and buffet dish. It tastes great; the mustard vinaigrette is very good. The haricots verts are not essential; after all it would cost more than $20 to buy enough to make it worthwhile. Make sure you don't overcook the beans at any rate (and refresh them in ice water immediately after removing from heat) because it's important to have a brilliant green color to contrast with the potatoes. It's really worth trying.

Although tasty, and the presentation was lovely, I felt that the roquefort was too strong. I bought expensive French Roquefort and the flavor was too overwhelming for my palette. I much preferred the taste of domestic blue as it blended better with the vinegarette. Would not recommend this for a family gathering...too strong for kids.

I made this dish for a weekend sea-kayaking trip. I cooked the potatoes and haricot verts in advance and assembled everything as a one-dish, no-cook side dish. Very nice!! Three forks plus.

this is the best potato salad I've ever eaten! I quarted some elephant garlic and roasted it along with the potatoes, and used gorganzola cheese in place of Roquefort. It makes a beautiful presentation.

I made this salad for a large gathering we had. Instead of the green beans,I added chopped spinich after I took the potatoes out of the oven. The heat from the potatoes wilted the spinich. It was absolutley delicious!!! Everyone loved it. Since I made 5 times the recipe I used a large aluminum throw-away pan to bake the potatoes--clean-up was a snap--I just threw the pan away! Of course, I served the salad in a nice serving dish. Everyone wanted the recipe!

A great salad and simplistic recipe. I added minced garlic and substituted walnut oil for olive oil in the vinaigrette. I also tossed the cooked potatoes with a little kosher salt(instead of using salt in the vinaigrette) and coarse ground peper. (And to keep the beans fresh don't add the vinaigrette to them until just before composing/serving the salad.)

This is an unbelievably delicious dish. I've made it many times, including last Thanksgiving. I always make a double batch of the viniagrette as it makes a lovely salad dressing too. Dried herbs work fine for the viniagrette (just use about 1/2 the amount). I've also substituted a good quality bleu for the roquefort, and regular green beans for the haricots verts if I can't find haricots verts (h.v. are better, but considerably more expensive). Best at room temperature. You will get many compliments - guaranteed! :)

I thought this recipe was great-- I served it with grilled steaks, and also with a fried chicken (boneless skinless) which made a hit both times. When I served it with steak, I substituted gorgonzola instead of roquefort (my taste preference) and got so many complements!!!
