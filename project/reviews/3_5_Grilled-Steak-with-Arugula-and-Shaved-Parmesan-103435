I love this recipe with a couple of minor changes. We use beef tenderloins as they are lower is fat and add tomato slices to the bed of arugula. The flavor that the marinade adds is what makes this so delicious! I had a very similar dish in Rome and was so pleased to find this recipe to try to duplicate it.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that we made a lesser amount. It's a wonderful recipe because it's so easy, but to be honest the great taste simply comes from the great ingredients. We made it for Father's Day and dad and daughter both loved it.

This is my most favoriate recipe and I'd give it 5 forks if I could. It is rather expensive to make and it just isn't the same when using a different cut of meat (I have tried on multiple occassions). I find one porterhouse feeds two easily and in some cases even three. I used an entire head of garlic and mashed it with olive oil and salt and cover the porterhouse and let stand for 20 minutes. I get a cast iron pan very hot and cook the steak until med-rare. The garlic gets very crispy and flavorful and I put it and the juices over the sliced steak on the salad and add additional olive oil (and everything else according to recipe). Use only the best quality olive oil. It's even better than what I get in Rome!

I rate this "ok" bascially because I thought it was a little bland. I couldn't really taste the olive oil or the parm (and I used the "good stuff" for both). Just tasted like a grilled steak to me.

My husband and I love agugula but I was skeptical about this because it looked too easy. It is fabulous and one of our favorites!

Made this for dinner last night; Pan fried fillet mignon until medium (fiancé doesn't like rare meat) then sliced & arranged over arugula. Poured the 'juices' rendered in the pan over the salad (I added a bit of minced garlic the last minute to the pan), then drizzled with a little extra virgin olive oil for added flavor. Served with wedges of vine ripe tomatoes and sliced raw shallots on the side. NOTE: After having the meat marinating in the fridge for a few hours we decided to go out to dinner instead and I threw the Ziploc in the freezer. Pulled them out 5 days later and they were great.

My husband and I both loved this. It was so simple, yet incredibly delicious. The only change we made was adding some balsamic vinegar to the arugula (as prescribed by other steak/arugula recipes I had seen). We used Penzey's peppercorns (crushed) and nice coarse sea salt. Delicious!

Mmmmm...still dreaming of this a week later. Second time making this, used baby arugula that was in the bagged salad section and it turned out even better.

This is a beautiful and simple dish. It is tasty and satisfiying. So, simple to make. Don't miss out on this recipe.

Very, very special. This is an extremely satisfying dish, yet it seems somewhat light because it masquerades as a salad. Open a favorite bottle of red wine break a baguette and you have yourself a treat!

Great recipe and loved by all - a "different" way to serve steak. I did an "Italian" themed steak dinner....bruschetta, grilled artichokes, then the steak with tomato salad and mushroom risotto. Will make again for sure....easy too!

Excellent & easy. I also used sea salt and fresh rosemary. Also used spring mix w/ arugula since my hubby isn't a huge arugula fan. Thanks for sharing these suggestions!

Fabu! Very similar to the steak in Tuscany. I did also put seasalt and fresh rosemary in the rub which made it perfect. Also, used thick rib eyes.. Very good....make sure you use arugula or a spring mix with arugula in it. Trader Joe's sells it by the bag like any other lettuce or greens......

I already loved Arugula - now I am spoiled to wanting all grilled steaks served in this style! So simple - any kind of quality beef can be served this way. Use only parmigianna reggiano and a small drizzle of Piccolo Molino olive oil - fantastic! I served with grilled zucchini, pepper and eggplant with buffalo mozzarella! Yummy!

You can't believe how fabulous this dish is. I first had it at a restaurant in Tuscany (Castellina in Chianti) called Il Pestello, which specializes in grilled meats. It's so simple-you can't go wrong. To the cook from Michigan, arugula is SO expensive.....what a rip off!! May I suggest getting some seeds, because it will grow anywhere!!! It's really easy.....I have more than I can use, because I love it too, and I always plant too much. Give it a try!

Fantastic eating. Easy but impressive. I used porterhouse steaks and my Foreman, which I bought at a deep discount and is quickly becoming my favorite. I served it with the wild mushroom risotto recipe also on this site. My boyfriend wasn't sure he liked arugula until he ate this, but he does now! Only caveat: in my area, arugula is an "herb," and is sold in small quantities, making it very expensive. So this is a special-occasion dinner for me only. Which sucks because I could eat arugula like a rabbit.

I have been making this ever since it appeared in the magazine. Everyone that has had it has raved about it. This is so simple but if you use the best ingredients available the flavors are superb! I get my arugula from the farmers market and use rib eye steaks.

This meal adapts itself well to serving a crowd. I made this last year for our church fund-raiser, a 175 person sit-down meal. I used 60 lbs. of top sirloin, i.e., New York strip, with all the fat trimmed off for easy slicing and serving. The meal was a smash hit.

Great and easy! Company loved it. Porterhouse steaks are the perfect cut for this meal. Garlic, meat and peppery flavor of arugula are wonderful together. Serve with fresh tomatoe salad and you are set for a great, easy meal.

Very good, I used Ribeye steak, 1 1/2inch thick and about 1lb a piece. 4 minutes a side. Red, rare and full of garlic. The spice from the arugula was fantastic.

This was simple, yet divine. I changed nothing, and prepared as suggested. Served with toasted almond pilaf and sliced fresh tomatoes topped w/ crumbled blue cheese and a nice, fresh vinaigrette. It was a delicious summer meal. Next time I will serve with a mushroom risotto! Yum!

I loved this dish! It took me back to beautiful Italia. This an easy wonderful summer dish. I did add some fresh sliced mushrooms and yellow bell pepper around the greens..just for color and a litle more olive oil. Easy, healthy and fast..who could ask for anything more..well, maybe, eating it on a warm summer evening in Roma?

This is wonderful. It is simple, incredibly tasty, and very authentic. The only observation I'd offer is that, while a porterhouse or T-bone is great, a good thick New York sirloin is a perfectly acceptable, and less expensive, alternative.

Great recipe - reminded us of the wonderful bistecca we enjoyed in Firenze. Good quality porterhouse steaks make the meal.

Great flavor combinations. Will certainly make it again

this is a great weeknight steak dinner. It encompasses the greens with the beef. Very easy and the shaved parmesan is yummy! Put some extra on the plate to eat with your greens. Will definitely make this again. Served with a side of risotto or potato.
