Incredible. Smooth as silk, deliciously flavorful & very light, as only 18% of the liquid is cream. (water is the primary ingredient) I will be making it again within a week & am going to seek more recipes with a similar cream to water ratio.

Very very easy with an ice cream maker. Quite yummy, you can taste the alcohol but it's not overpowering.

Yum!!! If you love White Russians, you'll love this dessert. Tip: Don't add the alcohol until the last few minutes or else it won't thicken up nicely in the ice cream maker.
