This was delicious. I made it with vegetable broth, added a little butternut squash, and followed others' suggestions to add more curry.

I used this recipe as kind of a base for a catch-all soup that absorbed my left over root vegetables after Christmas :X So I guess I didn't stick too closely to the recipe, but it was my first soup/stew. I threw in leeks, potatoes, parsnips, chickpeas... and then spices to taste which sort of goes against the entire theory behind spices I think? after having cooked a lot of Indian food. But, I added curry, garam masala and turmeric... I added a TON. And it still came out just moderately flavoured. Which is fine with me. But I was surprised and it made me wonder how bland this dish would have been had I followed the directions more closely. (Some of the previous reviewers lead me to believe that it might be, in fact, quite bland.) Also, I used veg broth in the place of water just because that makes everything taste better.

Followed others' advice and doubled the curry and added garam masala. Also, I added sauteed mushrooms and used chicken stock. Soup tasted much better the second day. Next time around, I think I'll try adding sweet potatoes.

fantastic! we used a little garlic and didn't do the spinach, used vegetable stock instead of the water. definite make again, but next time we'll probably take out the milk.

My husband and I loved it! i used sweet potato, earth balance butter, and almond milk- simply amazing and totally vegan!

OK, not great. The soup ended up being somewhat thin and I had to add a fair amount of extra spices to raise the flavor levels. Would make again, but with significant tinkering. Maybe add more potatoes and use vegetable stock instead of water.

I added chickpeas and subbed in soy milk. Wonderful.

I L O V E this! I have made this soup three times in the last two month and each time it get's better! I have also taken the advice of adding a few more spices, more curry and added a fennel bulb and it's awesome. This last meal, I used several small red potatoes, left the skins on and kept those vitamins. It added a little color and texture too.

I followed others reviews, doubled the curry, 1x garam masala, used veg broth and used red potatoes. It was excellent. I even used soy milk!

I tripled the amount of curry powder. Overall it's a great soup and very easy to make.

Added garam masala instead of curry powder, lots of garlic, a red bell pepper, some cumin seeds, coarsely ground pepper and corriander. Great twist on classic potato/leek soup, and incredibly fast, cheap, and easy, too!

Very bland. I added a dollop of sour cream and topped with a little grated cheese, but it was still lacking. I guess this would need garlic, or perhaps blanched onion bits or something.

Although it sounded good, this soup was completely bland. I had to add a ton of salt, and that still didn't fix it so I added a lot of channa masala (Indian spice mix for chickpeas). Maybe using veg/chicken broth instead of water would help.

I ran out of curry so used turmeric instead. I also added cumin, shallots, and used vegetable broth instead of water. Also, instead of pureeing the entire batch, I left back half of the diced potatoes to make the soup even heartier, giving you more than the spinach to chew on. A very flavorful, rich soup. The spices complemented each other so well. It was a great hit with my family. Everyone went for seconds (and thirds). This actually deserves a 3 1/2 forks.

I looked at my use-em or loose-em vegetables (one yellow onion, one leek, three tiny Pimpernell potatoes, and a head of broccoli) and looked at this recipe--noted the missing spinach and decided to try it anyway with what I had on hand. (Soup is usually pretty versatile.) It was delicious! I would definately make it again. I did add the chopped broccoli, about half the head, with the leek and onion, and used vegetable stock instead of water. We're curry fans so I used a 1/2 tablespoon, but that's just our preference.

This was a delicious, hearty soup. I made a few modifications -- used purple-leaved spinach which was perhaps too bitter. In the future will probably use normal spinach. I also added some scallions, whites along with the leeks and greens at the end, as I had them around. Did not have any curry powder on hand, so I sauted chilli powder, cumin powder, pepper and asafoetida and added that instead.

I substituted the water with chicken stock and sauteed garlic with the leeks and potatoes, and it turned out great. Everyone asked for the recipe that ate it and I would definately make it again!

I need to work on the consistancy a bit more with this one. Substituted cream for the milk and stock for the water because I like my soups rich with flavor. used a Madras hot curry and it was a big hit.

I have made this wonderful soup twice- once with half whole milk/half heavy cream and another time with just skim milk and an extra tablespoon of margarine. It was great both ways. A wonderful option for a light lunch soup also. I thought it had plenty of flavor-not too bland.

Fantastic! This is the best soup I've made! I followed the recipe to a 'T' and was thrilled with the results. Thanks for adding this soup to my arsenal!

Left out the curry, added low-salt chicken broth instead of water, and used a little fresh spinach. Then I CHILLED it, served as VICHYSSOISE! Delicious!

I also thought this soup needed more flavor. I added l little cumin, a packages of Wyler's instant chicken broth and seasoning mix and some white pepper, and thought it tasted great after these additions. It has a wonderful thick creamy consistency.

An easy to prepare, tasty soup. The spinach adds a nice touch to the taste and texture.

Very good recipe, I think the person who said it had no taste used not-so-good curry, which usually makes all the difference! I made it with broccoli rabe instead of spinach (steamed and then sauteed broccoli rabe, with a bit of garlic, and spooned over the potato-leek blend) and I added a couple of tablespoons of creme fraiche, and my guests raved. It is important to cook the curry in the butter before adding the potatos and leeks.

I thought this was delicious, my husband liked it too. It's nice not to have to make broth when making soup. I haven't decided what to serve with this soup next time, I'd like to hear what others are serving.

Excellent and easy, every time I've made this recipe it's been a great success.

I made this for a small dinner party and was embaressed at the taste. It was extremely tasteless. But if you dont like flavor in your food this receipe is for you!

Easy to make in that it doesn't require too many ingredients (exotic or otherwise) and versatile enough so you can vary the quantity of spinach to your liking. Don't try it with frozen spinach ... it's the crispness of the fresh stalks which makes the dish.
