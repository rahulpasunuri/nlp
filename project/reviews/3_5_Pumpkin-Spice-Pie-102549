i've made dozens of pumpkin pie recipes over the years, always looking for the perfect one. this is it--i've made it every year now since it came out and won't try anything else. don't overbake--just until top still jiggles a little--perfection! having said this, i do use only1/4 t nutmeg because i'm not a big nutmeg fan. my 10 year old grandson says "this is the best pumpkin pie i've eaten in my whole life!" i agree.

This was my first homemade pumpkin pie. I used the pre-made pillsbury pie dough for the crust and the crust was kinda thin but was ok. The filling had a slight sent of maple. I had grade b maple syrup that's been sitting in the fridge which is why I chose this recipe. The taste is yummy. The maple flavor makes it a little extra special. But the texture is a little too soft than what I prefer. I like the firmer, thicker pumpkin filling. I ate it about 5-6 hours after it was baked, so maybe the filling will firm up even more. Since this was my first pumpkin recipe, I'm going to move onto other recipes for comparison. But this pie was definitely tasty.

I've been making this pie for Thanksgiving for 5 years now. It's our favorite. I'm puzzled why people say it's lacking in flavor, not to us! I use grade B real maple syrup but 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 so it's a tad less sweet. Everything else as in recipe. The whipped cream is perfect.

this is hands down the best pumpkin pie recipe i've ever tried after looking for literally years. it's rich, spicy, and just right. the crust is perfect, too. it's my go-to-everytime-pumpkin-pie recipe; people clamor for it.

Excellent pumpkin pie with creamy, smooth filling. I did not use the whipped cream but the pie didn't need it. The only addition I made was to add a little ground ginger. Great recipe.

No flavor to speak of in this pie. Really didn't care for at all. I'm still searching for a good pumpkin pie recipe--this isn't it.

Excellent and easy . I have made this pie for 7 yrs.A crowd pleaser.

Wasn't wild about this pie. I prefer a richer version, rather than this more lightly flavored, spiced version, and the spiced whipped cream was flushed down the sink at the end of the night. The flakey pie crust seemed like a good start, but I stuck to the recipe and didn't bake the crust before filling it and it ended up less cooked than I would have liked.

I made this for the first time at Christmas in 2003. Every year I have made a different pumpkin pie in search of "the best". This and one other have tied. We all love it. It's full and spicy and the whipped cream is delicious. I'm making it for Thanksgiving this year even though we're not celebrating. We're still having pie!!

I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie usually; but this one is marvelous. If you have Grade B maple syrup, use that insetad of Grade A. The darker syrup adds a bit more bite to it.

I've never had pumpkin pie before (I'm not from the USA) so I'm not rating this recipe based on whether it is a good example of a traditional recipe, but just whether I liked the outcome - and I didn't! The only change I made was that I had to make my own pumpkin puree (it isn't sold in cans here!). I threw my print out of the recipe in the bin ... obviously it is a taste you either hate or love! I'll stick to savoury pumpkin dishes in the future!

Everytime I make this pie, somebody asks me for the recipe--even people who never liked pumpkin pie before. For the filling, I follow the recipe above, but add an additional half teaspoon of ginger to make it really spicy. For a more flavorful crust, I make a pastry crust of 1 C flour, 1 stick butter, 1 tsp salt and a little water. People swoon and need to be caught.

Very good and easy to make. The flaky crust was very smooth and easy to roll. I will make this again and try it with some shredded coconut added to the mixture.

My hubby declared a couple of days ago that he prefers store-bought pumpkin pie to homemade pumpkin pie. I set out to prove him wrong. I succeeded with this recipe! It was great...very easy, and the whipped cream was yummy. Thanks Epicurious!

Your search is over; this IS the best pumpkin pie EVER. I add 3/4 teaspoon ginger...ginger or not, it is divine. Enjoy.

Pumpkin pie is my three guys favorite pie. Made this recipe last year. Repeat at this Thanksgiving-received "it's a keeper" for all the guests. If you feel your maple syrup is too light, add a tablespoon of molasses for more zap.

This was the very first pumpkin pie I ever made and it was so good, excellent in fact. I'll be making it again this year for a Thanksgiving gathering we'll be attending with extra whipped cream.

I have made this pie two times so far; the first as a trial run before the Canadian Thanksgiving holiday and the second on Thanksgiving Day. The first pie was just "ok". I used a grade "A" Canadian maple syrup but Unfortunately, the flavour was too delicate (better used on its own) and the pie turned out almost bland, with almost no sweetness. The second time, I added a little more of the spices called for, used a "B" grade amber maple syrup (heavier texture, richer flavour for baking) and a bit of brown sugar. It was FANTASTIC! I highly recommend this recipe with the above modifications.

Made it for Easter. Was an absolute it. I couldn't believe how fast it went. Made it with a graham cracker crust and added extra van and cin to pie. This is now added to the menu at our house.

I found the spices in this allegedly "spice" pie to be too bland-- others liked it just the same, but i'd recommend the honey-pumpkin pie recipe instead.

Will definitely make again. The crust was flaky as promised and the whipped cream was a crowd favorite. As suggested previously, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/8 tsp ground ginger. Seemed to do the trick.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made it with fresh pumpkin puree from my Halloween Jack-O-Lanterns and added a pecan praline topping. It was wonderful.

From now on this is my pumpkin pie recipe. This pie is not too sweet and has a wonderful creamy texture. The only change might be to increase the spices a bit. The spiced whip cream was to die for. I actually caught one of my thanksgiving guests sneaking into the kitchen to lick the bowl.

My whole family loved this recipe, even the kids( who never like anything. I was a sinch to make, but when I went to make the spiced whip cream the cream was spoiled. So we made do with some from the store. I am going to make this every year, and next time I will get better cream.

Very rich, and flavorful. It took more than an hour to bake (in an 8" pan).

A light delicious not too sweet pumpkin pie. The secret is to use a medium amber real maple syrup. I made this pie to rave reviews last Thanksgiving and am doing a repeat for a different crowd this year.

The first pumpkin pie I've ever made and WONDERFUL! I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/8 tsp ground ginger. Also, I tweeked it a bit and used a variation from another recipe..I crumbled 1/4 cup pecans and 4 gingersnaps and laid them in the bottom before adding the filling. Supposed to be good for absorbing any excess liquid and good flavor/texture flair! It was GREAT! Very light and creamy..like tasting a cloud (cheesy, I know, but descriptive). I will make this time and time again. The flavored whipped topping makes a great compliment.

This is the worlds best recipe. I've been using it for almost two years and am now famous for my pumpkin pie. Dont skip the spiced whipped cream, it tastes great, and everyone I served it to was really impressed by the addition of my gourmet cream!

This pie is so easy to make and it's just wonderful. The maple syrup is much better than brown or plain white sugar; I think that's the secret to better-than-average pumpkin pie.

A good, not too sweet pumpkin pie. Use organic canned pumpkin -- it really makes a difference. Also I needed to bake it longer than the recipe stated.

This is my first time making this pie and it was absolutely fabulous (just like the show). Everyone in my family raved about it. And the whipped cream is a must. It may have made the pie. Loved every bite.

From the other reviews I was sure this would be a scrumptious pumpkin pie recipe. Truthfully I thought it was disappointing. It was not terribly spicy or rich with depth of flavor. This is not to say it's a bad recipe, but not wow. I am sure the pumpkin pie recipe of my dreams is still out there somewhere!

I already made this pie twice for my "pumpkin pie fanatic" boyfriend who LOVED this pie! I did add about a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to this recipe, as well as extra cinnamon. This pie is best served when chilled --a definite keeper!

Susan: I've never tried this trick with pumpkin pie, but if you place a pan of boiling water underneath cheesecake while it bakes, this prevents it from cracking. Hope this helps you.

Wonderful! Everyone at work raved about this pie. I cut the ground cloves to 1/8 tsp. and added 1/8 tsp. allspice and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. It's a perfect blend, no one spice "overpowers" and the custard is creamy and light. The whipped cream was a good cover for the top which ended up splitting after cooling. Anybody know why or how I can prevent?
