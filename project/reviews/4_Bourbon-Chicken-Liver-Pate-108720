This pate is so yummy! I used brandy instead of bourbon and followed the recipe to the T. Next time I will only make half a recipe as it made a lot of pate.

This is now my signature paté and I have tried many. It is excellent without changes. I pour the purée into ramekins and freeze any I am not using within a week. Thawed it is still excellent and a hit no matter who I serve it to. Perfect for a picnic with wine, cheese and baguette.

This is an awesome and easy pate. I like to settle small, sour cherries (like what you'd use in a Manhattan) in the butter. The tartness of the cherries goes well with the richness of the pate. Just a suggestion! Peace

I have made this recipes several times for friends and my husband all of whom rave about this pate. All of them have told me it's the best pate they have ever eaten. It smells really good when cooking. It's very easy to make. I have even given it away for Christmas with loads of appreciation from my pate loving friends.

I followed the recipe but my pate came out very dense and bitter. To serve it ended up adding some Miracle Whip (I know, bad on me) and that helped soften the pate enough to make it spreadable and also sweetened the flavor.

Any idea if this recipe would work with venison liver? I have some on hand (oddly enough!) and would really like to try making a pate with it for Thanksgiving. Thanks!

DELICIOUS! The best pate recipe Ive ever tasted, and it was so easy. I did skip the clarified butter, and just placed the plastic wrap directly on top. Everyone raved about it, and asked for the recipe, even those that said they really werent fond of pate loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Ok..I've made this before, exactly as written, and it was delicious. However, now I live in the mountains in Panama and it's difficult to find some things...not chicken, however. So I made it with what I could get my hands on..subbed oregano for marjoram and Spanish Port for the bourbon ....and it was still deliscious. This is a perfect pate recipe to use as is,or as a base. I love it!!!

I don't understand all this fear of butter--it's meant to flavour and preserve the pate as well as add extra nutrients. If you're lucky enough to get your hands on raw butter for this recipe, it only makes the pate taste that much better, too (as well as making it extra healthy for you). Don't skip the clarifying part, either: taking out the milk solids means removing that part that can go off--once you get those out then the butter will preserve your pate whether you choose to freeze it or not.

Holy Cow this was good! And easy! My pate snob friends haven't stopped praising it. Tweaked according to what I had at hand (as I imagine pate was meant to be made) used a nice rum instead of bourbon, skipped marjoram as I didn't have any, added some browned sage on top. So easy I can't believe I didn't figure this out on my own... lol

first time I made it - inspired by an appetizer at a local bistro. Based on another reviewers post, I used Capt Morgan's...didn't really taste it. Definitely needs more garlic. Will definitely make it again with some tweakage.

had my doubts while cooking this pate, the smell of warm liver isn't very appealing. The finished product, however, was very tasty! Combined it with a clementine mandarin kind of jam, sotly boiled mandarin with star anis and a stick of cinnamon.

Excellent pate. I followed recipe exactly. Will never buy pate again.

This is my go to recipe for pate. I prefer the fresh herbs and the touch of allspice is wonderful. My secret ingredient is to use some rendered chicken fat along with the butter. I also blend in the crispy chicken skin leftover after rendering for a slight crunch in the smooth pate. This item freezes well.

I have made this numerous times. I have used elk liver and venison liver as my husband is a huge hunter! This is absolutely delicious. I usually triple the recipe and put in a heavy cut-glass serving bowl. I do put it out at least 1/2 hour before guests arrive and love it the most with thinly sliced baguettes. It does freeze well if "sliced" and put between sheets of waxed paper.

I love this pate....and I don't even like liver! I do make it with brandy, rather than bourbon, and I increase the herbs a bit, too. Great at parties, and in small crocks for hostess gifts!

My husband made sourdough rye bread and wanted chicken livers to eat with it so I made this. WOW! Fantastic recipe. I did not bother with a butter seal since it will be gone in a few days for sure. I added mushrooms and they were a fantastic touch. I went about 1.5 on the herbs since I have them growing and need to use them, it wasn't too much, in fact, it's great with the extra herby flavor. Oh, it was super easy too. I will definitely be adding this to the party rotation as well, it's cheap sophisticated and sure to be a crowd pleaser.

Delicious and dont think I will every buy pate again. I had some extra portabello mushrooms on hand so I added those in with the livers to saute.

I have reviewed this recipe before but I had to share this with the others. Twice now I have had no bourbon in the house, so I have instead substituted Captain Morgan spiced rum. In my opinion and in the opinion of those who insist I make it when they come to my house ;^) it is MUCH better with the spiced rum than with the bourbon. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

This was a hit with a group that didn't like liver. I lined the crock with plastic wrap and decorated the bottom with a sprig of sage AND did the butter seal, which meant when I inverted it, the butter was on the bottom. The butter was cold and hard and wouldn't break up, while the pate was smooth. I only made it the morning before, so I could have left out the butter seal and used plastic wrap for a seal. None of the other reviewers talked about serving temperature, but I think it was much better when it came to room temperature. The butter softened up also.

Rating: 3
The closest thing I had to a pate crock was a stonewear onion soup bowl and so used it. It was difficult digging out the pate in that vessel and I found the ratio of butter to pate wasn't right. My fresh sage leaf was not clearly visable underneath the butter. Next time, I'll purchase a terrine and add more bourbon and slightly more herbs. Served with cornichons, fig and balsamic mustard, fresh fig and port jam.

Rating: 4
Wonderful. I've made this a few times and never bothered with the butter seal since I never make it more than a few days ahead, I just press plastic wrap directly onto the surface. I like the presentation when you line the mold with plastic with a few sage leaves arranged on the bottom then chill and invert for serving, very pretty. I have to make sure to send the leftovers home with someone otherwise I just cannot leave it alone and will eat every bit of it myself.

This is a delicious and easy pate to make. It also allows for experimentation with flavors. I used Absinthe instead of bourbon to give an anise flavor to the Pate. I like it on the creamy side, so I added a touch more butter and blended for extra long.

Fantastic! Super easy and quick to make (except the waiting for it to set up). I made a few substitutions: used 3/4tsp Herbs de Provence instead of the thyme and marjoram. Used white pepper in place of the black. This recipe is a keeper.

Delish and easy! Lined dish with saran wrap so that it could be served upside down. Had guests ask for the recipe.

I've made this seven or eight times now over the years and people absolutely love it! My husband prefers it when I double the bourbon (I'm not sure I can tell any difference). I also puree beyond smooth, until it is very creamy. I agree that it tastes much better after a day or two (especially if you use dried herbs), so I always make this for our parties, or if I'm going to an event but don't have time to cook that day. The pate is very easy to make (again, especially if you use dried herbs); in fact, the most difficult part of this recipe is cleaning the food processor afterward. But people think you've really labored over this thanks to the way all the flavors come together for great richness and complexity. I typically grow and use fresh herbs in most of my dishes, but in this case I'm happy to advocate dried. You can totally get away with it and make darn good stuff.

Didn't seem to make the 2 1/2-cups as described. Filled three 1/2-cup ramekins. The taste and texture was excellent, but I would make a few changes next time. 1. Saute onion separate from livers, as the livers would cook/carmelize better and more evenly if not coated with the onion. 2. Flame the bourbon. 3. Add a little parsley. 4. Salt and pepper "to taste", instead of using the amounts in the recipe. The salt and pepper get lost after the flavor deepens with refrigeration. I also pressed herbs beneath the butter seal. Served this with garlic butter toasted baguettes, sauteed chanterelle, cornichon and French grain mustard

Absolutely incredible. Everyone raved, and it was so easy. It makes a lot, though, so in the future I'll halve it for a smaller get together.

I received rave reviews as a Christmas appetizer. As previously mentioned I lined the crock with saran, put a sage leave on the bottom, butter sealed at top, and flipped over to serve. Good tip from another cook. Will make again.

I brought this to a holiday gathering this week. Just delicious. I skipped the butter top, and since I didn't have bourbon, used B&B. I put it in a crock on a wooden platter, with a plate of cornichons cut in a fan style, and a pretty dijon mustard jar. With toasted baguette slices, it was just wonderful and will be a staple when a dish like this is needed. I'm going to make some more tomorrow for my family. Lovely to have on hand as the snow falls.

I rec'd a ramequin of this pate for Christmas a few years back - loved it - called for the recipe - kept itfor 3 yrs and finally made it today. It is wonderful - I'll be giving a few for Christmas this year - made 6 ramequins worth - I plan on keeping a couple for myself.

Very good pate, everyone raved. I made individual appetizer sized pates by using 2 oz ramekins. I lined the ramekin with plastic wrap for easy removal and put a leaf of sage on the bottom. I did butter seal the top, but inverted the pate onto the serving plate for a nice presentation minus the ugly butter without having to scrape it off (you're already eating a lot of butter, what's 1 tbsp more? Plus that's a lot of work) Enjoy! You'll be amazed at how easy it is.

I will never buy store-bought liver pate again. This was just fabulous. I did not use clarified butter, just melted butter on top. And I did not put enough butter on top, so it did discolor a little. Just a little mix with a spoon will distribute the pink and the brown color of the liver. I also had fresh sage which I laid a leaf on top of the ramikins before pouring in the butter.

The best! So easy to prepare, and tastes awesome. Everybody loves it. I've already made this a couple of times. I put it in two ramekins, that way if it isn't all used up at the first event, the butter seal is still intact and I can still serve it a week later. Does anybody know if this freezes well?

This was delicious as part of a buffet. I made it about 5 days ahead of time and didn't do the clarified butter seal, just used the wonderful new press 'n seal right on the surface. I tweaked a little bit based on other recipes that I read and have made in the past. Added some balsamic vinegar and a little lemon juice along with the alcohol (used Jack Daniel's single barrel whiskey, that's what I had) to brighten up the flavor a bit. I served it with a spiced prune chutney from another mag (sorry, but hey) and they were a perfect match. This makes a lot, and I had 12 people over and there were lots of leftovers (I could've eaten it all myself) so I divided up the rest into 4 small portions and froze them.

OK I am guilty guilty guilty of altering the recipe and then having the nerve to rate it. I did make it as written and didn't really care for it that much - two forks at best. Then I made it again with just the butter, livers, kosher salt, white pepper, herbes de provence and bourbon and thought it was delicious!!!

Had been trying to duplicate a special recipe lost in an overseaes move, and this turned out wonderfully. Give it a try with good Cognac instead of Bourbon though.

I made this dish 2 weeks ahead of our event and it kept very well. For those who like liver, it is excellent and very easy to prepare. However, I was expecting a more solid consistency- such as that of fois gras. This was a little more "mushy." I'd still make it again although next time I'll try using ramekins instead of a terrine pot.

This was the first time I have made Pate and it turned out as good as any I have eaten in Restaurants. I did soak the liver in milk for 3 hours prior to cooking and added a tablespoon of Port Wine in addition to the Bourbon. I also added salt and pepper to taste.

Great pate. Flavours meld after day or two and really give interesting depth of taste. Due to lack of allspice (can't get in England), used dash of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon.

Because of it's longevity, I made this for a couple parties in which I needed an appetizer. I made a new crock a hostess present and took the pate in it. The butter looks like chicken fat and is kind of bad but is needed to keep the liver form tuning color I presume. Put your sprig of herb on last after applying clarified butter. So sweet and creamy.

This was a delicious, quick and inexpensive dish. It literally took less than half an hour to make but it looked like you've slaved for hours over it. Even my 8-year old daughter liked it. I did not have allspice so I omitted it, and I used cognac instead of bourbon. To the previous reviewer: I think sealing pate with butter is essential, since it assures that when you unseal it, it has this appealing pink color inside. And I think your mother's advice of putting it in the plastic wrap applies to more solid pates. This one looked great in a crock with a sprig of thyme on top and a layer of butter (which actually tastes delicious when spread on the bread with the pate).

Just fixed this for Thanksgiving appetizer and as you would expect the kids would not touch it but the adults loved it. Was asked for recipe and had to convince several that indeed this was made with chicken and not goose liver. My sister is going to make it for an upcoming xmas party. Only problem with the recipe is that I put to much butter on the top. Think I would leave this off if I made it again or would take off the butter before serving. Also, my mother says you should put the pate in plastic wrap before pouring so you can lift the pate out to put on serving tray.

This really is an easy recipe and the results are quite good. I would suggest increasing the amount of fresh herbs to give the pate a more pungent flavor. I substituted cognac for the bourbon since it was what I had on hand.

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I made it for a cocktail party and it was a hit. One recommendation - make sure to smooth out the pate as well as you can to ensure a flat surface on which to pour the clarified butter. A sprig of thyme in the center made a beautiful presentation. Even better 3 - 4 days later.
