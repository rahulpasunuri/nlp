I made this and yes it was flavorful, but just wondering has anyone covered the roasting pan during the 1.45 hrs.? My pieces were quite dark and dried although tasty. I covered the pan the second time I put it in the oven and there was barely any sauce left.

Excellent! This dish is easy to make since much of the prep is the day before. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus for two with much left over.

So good! I diverged only slightly -- added a few cloves of garlic and fresh marjoram to the lamb and I used vegetable broth because it's what I had. I also only had a 3 lb piece of lamb. But still, this was the most phenomenal lamb I've ever made. I served it with roasted root vegetables, a nice side of mixed field greens and cote de rhone.

This was an outstanding dish. The lamb was extremely tender and well-flavored. I only did one reduction on the sauce as I wanted to keep as much in reserve as possible for topping the potatoes which I served with it. I would like to make a larger quantity of the sauce next time, but I fear that increasing the sauce ingredients without increasing the amount of lamb would leave the reduction without much of its delightful flavor. The trial run for immediate family was successful and we would certainly serve it for dinner guests!

I make this dish every Easter. Great flavor-follow the recipe.

I made the Lamb for Easter and it was fantastic. Three of my guest, that would normally not eat lamb, had seconds. I made a faster version because of lack of time. I did not marinate for 24 hours (just 10 minutes).I cut the meat much smaller and also omitted the beef broth (just because I forgot). The whole dish took me about an hour and a half. Super tender and delicious.

Samantha, your lack of tenderness may have been more due to the incorrect cooking temp/time, than the quantity of meat. You roast this for nearly 2 hours at the higher temperature, then roast some more at 350. Check the instructions, and try again!

I give this four forks because the tenderness was the only thing missing; I had a 3 lb boned shoulder, which changes cooking time dramatically. So, that's my fault. Or, should the oven be pre-heated to 425, then lowered to 350 when the shoulder goes in? In any case, the flavor, and the SMELLS!!, were excellent. The bone would have lent more flavor. The sauce...mmmmm.

A wonderful lamb dish that is different from the traditional roasted leg of lamb and easy to make. I followed the directions precisely until I got to the beef stock -- I did not have any homemade and had to resort to the canned. However, I added a good heaping tablespoon of veal demi glace (from Williams Sonoma) to it and heated it so I could mix it in well. I served it on a bed of red potatoes whipped with fresh lemon zest. Tasted pretty good to my crowd.

This is a fine Easter tradition. The lamb was tender and tasty, and of a roast (not stew) tenderness. I cooked it pretty much as suggested and served it with the gnocchi which was wonderful.
