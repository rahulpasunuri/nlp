This is a very good, healthy dip. I did make some changes though... it needed salt and pepper, and was almost too thick for dipping so I added about 2 T. olive oil and 2 T. water. I think I would try a dash of cayenne next time just to kick it up a little.

This is delicious and healthy. I added some stone-ground mustard, which sounds strange, but it spiced it up a bit.... Thanks for the recipe!

This dip is not the most amazing dip I have ever tasted, but I gave it four stars because it does taste good (definitely better than store bought dips), it's healthy, it's SO easy, and I make it all the time. I add a touch more pesto than the recipe calls for and also grate some fresh parmesan in it as well. I keep it in the fridge and snack with it, it keeps well and tastes better the next day.

Tasty dip which benefited from a night in the refrigerator. I'm enjoying it 2 days later with fresh vegetables. It'd be nice on bread with turkey, I think. I just loaded in the pesto, using more than was called for.

YUM! Easy, healthy and delicious recipe, what more could you ask for! Made as written but with homemade pesto.

A perfect healthy snack made with ease! I served with broccoli, red onions, cucumbers & red peppers. I added 2Tbls of Basil flavored olive oil and 2Tbls of garlic flavored olive oil while processing the beans and it was perfect! I simply used the lemon juice to taste (slightly less) and it was a winner!!!

Fast, simple, and delicious. Everyone loved it. Ideal with homemade pesto if you have it. Either way, definitely add extra parmesan or romano.

This is delicious! I don't find it bland at all, you have to be a big fan of both cannellinis and pesto. Which I am. So I love it! I make it on Sunday and take it to work with me throughout the week with snap peas, cherry tomatoes, carrot sticks, sliced red bell peppers and celery. If you like cannellini beans, and if you like pesto, definitely try this!

Very simple and well liked by the crowd! I followed others instructions to not be shy with additional pesto or lemon juice. I also added more olive oil to help with the consistency. Overall - easy and delicious!

I used 4 TBLS lemon juice, 1 TBLS olive oil, 2/3 cup pesto and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Delicious!

This is a great recipe for a healthy dip, and so simple to make. I also use this as a substitute for mayonnaise in tuna salad sandwiches.

This was really yummy. I added extra lemon juice (4 T), a little olive oil while blending the beans, and an unmeasured amount of pesto (more than a cup). Served it with pita chips, baby carrots & cut up red pepper. Everyone loved it!

Pretty good recipe. I added a little extra pesto and a little extra lemon juice and 2-3 garlic cloves. Helps encourage healthyier nibbling on vegetables.

Very simple and pretty darn tasty-a good weeknight supper with carrots and chips (would have preferred toasted pita, but was out) and a glass of wine. Used very good homemade pesto, added a dash of olive oil to smooth it out some, added shredded parmesan and black pepper on top. Tastes creamy and rich.

This is so easy, and a big party hit. I do recommend labeling, as it was visually confused with pate. I did add a bit of parm to recipe. it lightened the flavor a bit.

Way too dry--just a mess. Totally unsalvageable. Very disappointed.

Great quickie app. Jazz up the pesto (I used stuff that had been in my freezer for a few years) (i.e. add more garlic, etc. to taste). I garnished it with toasted pine nuts and some shredded Parm, and it looked nice. I also added some of the juice from the canned beans when I pureed the mixture (never throw that stuff out till you are done tinkering with the recipe; you may want or need that liquid, but then you don't need to add as much olive oil). The color is a bit drab, but if surrounded by lovely vegies and other dippers, no one will notice. Garnish with some fresh basil if you have it.

Very simple, very quick, very tasty, very healthy. Also keeps for days in the refrigerator! A staple in my house for snacking and as an appetizer for impromptu dinner guests while I whip something up!

Served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it! I also marinated the meat for 24 hours and actually made extra paste to really cover the meat.

This takes about 30 seconds to make - it's great served with veggies - needs salt and extra lemon juice - but if you like hummus, you'll like this.

Okay, this is a review for the white bean and pesto dip. It was bland and also dreary looking. I had a lot left over and eventually threw it out.

This recipe was absolutely perfect. My guests are still talking about it.

This dip has no flavor. I even tried using generous amounts of salt and lemon juice as well as a heavily concentrated pesto paste. It still came out tasting like creamy cardboard. Blech!

I thought this was delish! Used homemade pesto, about 1c.

Bland bland bland--only person at the party who liked this was a vegetarian who avoids butter and salt. All else mistook it for guacamole and were sorely disappointed!

Dry and tasteless, even when made with great quality pesto. Wouldn't waste my time with--purchased dips are better.

this dish is great! It is incredibly simple, healthy, and it couldn't be much easier to prepare. It's also quite versatile-we served it for a party and used it the next few days on sandwiches and with vegies.

(If this is applied to the right recipe!!) This dip is good -- very rich, dense flavor. Easy to make and goes well with veggies, crackers, pita, whatever. A real stick-to-the-ribs dip. It's a party staple for me.

Made it for the first time tonight. Very good and easy. Had a simular recipe in Ann Arbor this summer at the Prickly Pear Cafe. Next time I might ad a dash of Hot sauce and thin it out a bit. Very good.. Try it. Thanks

A good quality pesto is important. I used an inexpensive pesto and my guests weren't too thrilled with the dip. The recipe has potential though-I would attempt it again.

I had problems with the recipe. I couldn't get the beans to mash in the processor. I ended up created quite a mess.

Delicious and easy to make. The pesto you buy contributes heavily to the taste, so buy well!

Any hummus fan would delight in this easy alternative for a change of pace.

Well-intentioned but misses the mark somehow. The flavor is a bit too bland and needs something to perk it up.
