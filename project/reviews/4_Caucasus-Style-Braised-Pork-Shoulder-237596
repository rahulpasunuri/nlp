This was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I didn't manage to let it sit the full 8 hrs the 2nd time around and I don't think it mattered, couldn't have been more tender, or more flavourful! The broth was kneee-bucklingly good. We will make this again and again!

this recipe makes awesome pulled pork! the sauce is so flavorful and the meat so tender. i didn't follow the full resting/cool down time as suggested and it still turned out superb. definitely a worthwhile recipe to try for your family or dinner party.

This recipe doesn't need as much time as they say to turn out fabulous! I started with a frozen bone-in pork shoulder the morning of the day I served this. I partially thawed it in the microwave, trimmed it very thoroughly of all fat, and then rubbed on the paste. Without any waiting, I browned it all over. I checked with an instant read thermometer, and it wasn't even fully thawed inside. But I just went ahead and started the braising. I didn't do the cooling, and skimming (because I had trimmed so carefully, there was very little fat). I simply cooked for the full 4 hours. It was totally perfect. I pulled the pork off the bone and mixed with the juices, and OMG - I can't imagine it would be better any other way.

Not as unusual flavor as I had hoped for. I skipped the marinating time, as well as the post-braising refrigeration time, and it was still delicious! Flavors were very well-balanced. I tried the cabbage route as one reviewer suggested. Made for a different sort of meal than our usual. The kids couldn't get enough of the pork-braising/cabbage broth! There were no leftovers. Now (only 1 week later) will try it again for taco night.

This was so easy and the results were fantastic. The flavor profile was amazing and EVERYONE had seconds!

I served this for guests and they raved. I thought it was excellent even though I kind of short-cutted on time. For one, I didn't marinate for 3 days, only overnight. Secondly, I didn't leave in fridge for at least 8 hours, but only 5. Even so, it was tender and flavorsome. I found the fenugreek has a tempest of a smell when you first grind it, but in the dish it's sublime. As far as trimming the fat and skin goes, I think all you need is a nice pair of poultry shears and you'll do just fine. I left a thin layer of fat on for flavor and even so there wasn't any fat to remove from the surface before the final hour of cooking.

This is a fabulous recipe. Can't always get pork shoulder, but when I do, this is what I do with it. Use extra garlic and spices, and marinade 3 days to get the flavours throughout the roast.

This was a real hit for a family of pulled pork lovers. I usually do a cuban rub/marinade for pork butt, but kept this around as it sounded different. Used an 8lb shoulder on a two burner gas grill for 6 hrs at ~225, using hickory chips on front burner,roast set over rear burners (low for 2 hrs then rear turned off for last 4). Then moved to oven for two hrs, covered with foil at 225 to get the juices/onions for the sauce. Spice combo is different, but lends a savory taste that stays with you.

WOW! This was my first time making a piece of meat this large. My husband said it tasted like ribs, and devoured it. 3 forks because the fat removal was rather difficult (for me).

This roast is delicious with sauerkraut. The teaspoon of vinegar at the end is key. I served it after it came out of the oven, skimmed off the fat in the pot and used some of the roast juices to flavor the sauerkraut. I also flavored the oil with cumin and coriander when I browned the roast.

Really liked this combination of seasonings. First time I ever used fenugreek, and it's very reminiscent of curry powder, for which it's an ingredient. The slow braising does wonders for this economical cut of pork.

Delicious! I made it with shoulder chops and modified cooking times accordingly. Never used fenugreek before, and found it to be wonderfully hearty and fragrant. I love Central Asian cuisine, and would recommend this to anyone else who does as well.

Pork shoulder is a favorite in my household and I usually simmer an 8lb piece for about 3 hours and it's succulent beyond words. This was a nice change, but the fenugreek had to go, I find the aroma unbearably vile, guess you had to grow up with it to like it.
