Best Guac is made by first making a batch of Pico de Gallo as spicy or not as you like and then mix it in with the avocados, mushed or coarse, again as you like. And DON'T add any water, ever.

Didn't use any water, but I did add some diced tomato which helped to thin it out & only used 1/2 tsp. of salt. I would actually use even less salt next time b/c there are so many other strong flavors in this recipe.

We loved this recipe! I used half a chopped jalapeno, only 1 tsp. salt, no water, and less than 1/4 cup of minced onion. We'll definitely make it again!

Good standard guac recipe. I added diced tomates and doubled the chiles for more flavor. Didn't add any water either as we prefer a thicker guac. Very yummy.

Rating: 3
This was delicious! The only change I made was leaving out the chiles because it made the guacamole way too hot for me. Also I like it thick, so only added a couple tablespoons of water. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was a simple, good recipe. The only change I made was less salt (about 1/2 tsp) and less water (about 1/4 cup).

In response to last reviewer, I first made this recipe as stated exactly and found it too insipid. I added: 3 crushed garlic cloves, 20 grape tomatoes cut into eighths and then sliced, and 3 sliced scallions. I had rave reviews from everyone at the meeting - and one person told me it tasted just like the one she had in Mexico. According to my taste: Goes in mild, then gives you and interesting kick. Great recipe.

GIVE US A BREAK!!!! How about not rating a recipe if you don't follow it!!! Some of us might like to know how the ORIGINAL recipe turned out....not some variation a cook came up with because they didn't have the proper ingredients.

One of the BEST Guacamole recipes I have ever made, even hubby who does not like avocados, LOVED it!! the addition of tomatoes and dry red pepper flake(did not have a serrano chile) like the other reviewers mentioned helped it feel like resturant guacmole. Flavors are definatly spot on!

Terrific. Who knew making fresh home made guacamole was this easy and delicious.

So easy, so good. (Add water a little at a time to get the dipping consistency you want) And be careful of the chile amount!!!!

Rating: 4
Delicious!! The recipe depends upon the simplicity of combining just a few ingredients that work so well including the onion and the pepper. But I would disagree on the implied lots of lime juice. Less is more. You want the avocado to shine. Otherwise a good recipe.

Being Guatemalan, I only make guacamole this way: mash the avocados (you want them chunky) add lots of lime juice, salt to taste and a little oregano rubbed between your fingers. No tomatoes,chilis, onions or garlic. The whole idea is for the avocados to shine. I always bring guacamole to pot lucks and people can never believe how good it is this way. Try it one time.

Wow - this is a great recipe. I also made a few variations: 1. forget the water - not needed at all 2. I added 1 firm plum tomato chopped 3. I didn't have any serrano chile so I add a dash of red chile flakes. - very good. When I make it again, I'll cut the salt in half. I served this with typical corn/nacho chips which were also salted so I found overall it a bit too salty. Very easy to make and very flavourful. Sarah - Erin Ontario

The perfect simple guacamole recipe! YUM!!! Great with out the cilantro & serrano chiles too!

Rating: 0
this is a great traditional guacamole recipe.....but i found that a whole serrano chile was much too strong for my taste..... it overpowered the other flavors. Next time I make this I will add the chile at the end - bit by bit so that I can taste it as I go. i also used the juice of 2 limes and a roma tomato...and I left out the water - not necessary. very good

Recipe was very good. I will definitely make again. I didn't use water because, well, I don't know, it just seemed weird to add water. It doesn't hurt to adjust the ingredients (onion, cilantro, salt) according to taste.

This recipe has more than the typical amount of onion, but I very much enjoyed it that way. I did not add any water since I was using it more as a condiment rather than as a dipping sauce. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Very easy; I would make this again.

DELICIOUS. I have made it twice. Once with avocados that weren't very ripe and once with perfectly ripe ones. Added extra cilantro that I had been growing. Used extra red onion and a pastry fork to mix. Added no water. The salt and lime make it. Guest LOVE it.

Omitted water, substituted 1/2 poblano pepper for serrano, doubled the lime juice. Amazing.

Very easy, good flavors and textures. I used a jalapeno, two Tbsp. of salsa and skipped the H2O.

Very good recipe. Flavor is much better if you use a food processor to chop the cilantro, chile and garlic cloves (my preference to add), this pulls the cilantro flavor through and make the entire thing a bit creamier. I prefer to substitute red onion for the white onion.

This was too bland. I added garlic chili hot sauce, doubled the lime juice, and didn't add the water. Plus added 2 cloves of garlic. The whole bowl disappeared in 5 minutes!

people on this site are too kind...... the recipe is good only because nearly everyone knew enough to alter it in significant ways, and let's face it, guacamole is good...... there is too much of nearly everything in the recipe-- salt, cilantro, onion, and even the serrano.... i didn't mind the heat, but guac should be smoother and more "avocadoey".... make some habanero salsa to add on the side if you need more spice..... i'll echo texas cook's suggestion to skip the fresh garlic and go for powder if you want some garlic flavor...... probably the only time i'll ever suggest that-- the fresh does overwhelm the avocados pretty easily....... now i'm off to find a good recipe....

Rating: 3
This is the most authentic recipe I've seen here for guacamole. Omit the water and resist the temptation to add tomato which is mostly water anyway. If your avocados are ripe you'll be rewarded with a smooth creamy texture. Also try garlic powder instead of fresh which can easily overwhelm the taste of avocado.

while i usually follow ricipes more closely i only had half an avocado and wanted to find a dip recipe that would have something to extend it so i added greek yogurt as milk products were suggested in the recipe description. i didnt use water, i added lime, chopped cherry tomatoes, onions to taste. i also didnt have jalopenos so used a dash of spicy creole powder. topped with chopped cilantro. the yogurt gave it a tang and lovely texture, the color is beautiful and it tastes very good altho it isn't classic guacamole.

Whats up with the water? how about some fresh tomato. Hass avos are the way to go.

I made this for a pre-wedding party dinner so I quadupled it trying to make about 8 cups. It was just one of many munchies to go with chili and taquitos but the guests inhaled it in short order and nearly started licking the bowl!! I had some perfect avacadoes at just the right stage of ripeness so I did not add any water and it was perfect. I will always use this recipe when I need guacamole.

Three forks with one exception...I reduced the water to only 2 tablespoons which I have to admit did make it easier to scoop onto very thin tortilla chips. 1 cup would have made it a soup! Overall, a very light, fresh guacamole.

Ok, but it can be even better. Think about adding some pepper, garlic salt instead of salt, and plus OREGANO. It would taste like the avocado from heaven! then get some fat free nachos and enjoy it!

A new staple in my recipe collection. Absolutely loved by all! Very flavorful. NO water needed. Slight adjustments: used scallions instead of onions(snot as strong), did the one pit full of hot sauce suggestion for another reviewer(just mild heat-was not hot for even the mildest of friends), then tossed it all in the food processor. Did add one extra avocado and a tomato at the end hand chopped for texture and color. Everyone raved and nothing was left. I couldn't ask for better.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe using scallionsin place of the white onion, and Tobasco instead of serrano chilies. I also added a little more than a half cup of cilantro. It's pretty tasty. Almost like the restaurant Salpicon in Chicago. I'm still looking for the quintessential guacomole recipe. But this is good.

It's Super Bowl Sunday, and I've just made this wonderful guacamole. And no, no water added. I used 1/2 a lime, and without any chilis in my refrigerator, filled the center of half an avocado with Frank's Hot Sauce. Everything went into the food processor and was literally done in minutes. The gang's due shortly, and they're in for a treat - this is a scrumptious recipe. I'd probably add 1/2 a fork, if I could, to the three I gave it (just NO water!! It couldn't be smoother.)

WATER!? Huh? Since when does one put a CUP of water into guac? Otherwise, divine recipe, much like my own staple guacamole...but WATER!?

Awesome guacamole! I added a clove of minced garlic and skipped the water. All the flavors come out beautifully -- the fresh avocado, the cilantro, the onion, the subtle bite of the garlic, and the spice of the chile pepper. The best guac I've ever had (and I made it!! :)

Rating: 3
This delicious recipe could use some slight modifications. First, start off with 1/4 to 1/2 cup water and blend. If it is too thick, add more water. I would also recommend cutting down on the salt. Start off with 1/2 teaspoon and then add more to taste. One serano chile was not enough for me. I added an additional one and would probably enjoy it even more with a third.

I omitted the water and used a food processor and the recipe turned out great. I loved it because it is really spicy and salty. It disappeared very quickly. I'd definitely make it again.

I think one can modify a recipe to individual preferences, and that it's okay to do so even if pure authenticity is sacrificed a little! I love this recipe and always add fresh mashed garlic. I don't add water either. I like the chunks of mashed avocado. I always get rave reviews - people seem to never have fresh guacamole! One other tip - make sure to cover it with a layer of plastic wrap touching the entire surface - a layer of air means brown guacamole! Delicious recipe, and virtually carb-free.

I love the taste of avacados, peppers and lime, but I still get secretly (childishly) grossed out by some people's guac... seriously, it is normally an awful colour, with a "pukey" texture and has unidentified black, brown or red chunks in it... Well gross out no more.. this Guac recipe has a beautiful presentation ( I puree it) AND a tangy, delightfully spicy flavour. Guests always say I make the best guac ever... and this is my recipe.

Perhaps you should have labeled this "Guacamole Sauce," since that's what it is with water added. True guacamole is mashed and always contains garlic. It usually contains tomatoes, as well, though they are not absolutely necessary. The primary taste should be lovely avocado (Haas are best) with the sharpness of lime, the headiness of garlic, and a hint of hot pepper. The most important thing is not to obscure the avodado, just to enhance it. Guacamole should not have the consistency of baby food, but should have a few tiny bits of the fruit still intact.

Where's the garlic and tomato? There are as many guacamole recipes as there are cooks in Mexico, but the garlic really adds a necessary taste. Try adding it. I make mine chunky by cutting the avocado in cubes, unless I'm going to use it as a sauce.

Here is the real McCoy as it is done in South Texas and Northern Mexico. I make this all the time. It's really easy! Use 4-5 medium Haas avocados. (Black skin is good). They should yield slightly to a little finger pressure. Cut them in half lenghtwise. With a tablespoon, pry out the seed. Scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Mash with a fork or a potato masher until most of the lumps are gone. (NEVER, never make guacamole in a blender or food processer.) Add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Add chopped onion and chopped tomato to taste. Yes, you can also put in things like chopped cilantro and chopped serrano pepper (never jalapenos). You can also add a bit of lemon juice which, by the way, will keep it from turning black. Another way to keep it green for serving later is to place the seeds halfway in and cover with plastic wrap. With lemon and the seeds, it will keep in the fridge for several hours. A serving tip is to make it sans onion and tomato and then serve it in three strips - tomato, avacado, onion. This is called "a la bandeira" or flag style because the flag of Mexico is red, green, and white.

I also did not use any water and less of the required salt (but I used regular salt, not kosher). I also added chopped tomatoes. Instead of using a serrano chile, I just used some regular green chopped chile from a jar. I thought this reciple was very good and everyone in my family loved it.

I also didn't use the water, because it just seems bizarre (and I eat Guacamole so rarely, when I do I want the thicker texture). I also added tomato, but couldn't find peppers. Used Tabasco, and it turned out great! I was surprised it looked so good even after a night in the fridge--I had it again for lunch today.

Great guac but I gave 3 forks because 1.5 tsp of salt is way too much. I put in only 1 tsp and it is still too salty. I also added some chopped tomato and 1tsp minced garlic. Tastes better next day when the flavors have blended.

Very nice guacamole recipe. I also used a little less salt and 3 avacados instead of 2.

Nice recipe. I omitted the serrano since I didn't have one around, but tossed in some fresh tomatillo salsa instead. I'm always suspicious of raw onion, but here it added very nice flavor without being completely overpowering. Great with grilled portabello quesadillas and freshly made pico de gallo.

I used one large jalapeno with seeds (which I believe is equivalent to 2 serranos) and the guacamole had the right amount of heat for us. I did not dilute it with water. We thought it was great.

This was great. I have been trying to find a recipe for a guacamole dipping sauce that I tasted (made a pig of) while visiting Texas and this is very close. It was weird to add the water, but the taste was not diluted. My market did not have serrano chili, so I bought jalapeno and without the seeds did not have enough heat, so added some cayenne. The great thing about a guacomole dipping sauce is that it coats and you do not have to scoop. The chip (or whatever)is coated with lots of taste - the dip last longer at big parties and fewer calories for those of us who are addicted to guacomole.
