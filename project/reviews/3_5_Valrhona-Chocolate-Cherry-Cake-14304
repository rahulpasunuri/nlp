I am giving this one fork and would give it none if I could because it cost me a GOOD buck to get the Valhrona and dried cherries and the results were dry as dust. Rogers & Gray's Chocolate Nemesis with a handful of dried cherries would be a MUCH better bet! Try it.

i bake desserts for local restaurants and i was disappointed---read about Mad61 (restaurant this recipe came from) in Anthony Bourdain's "kitchen confidential" and expected too much maybe. I agree with another reviewer---i think the baking time is too long---it came out very dry. and the cherries weren't pronounced enough. still, i think i must have done something wrong because everyone raved about it. hmmm...

Delicious. The tartness of the cherries is a nice contrast to the richness of the cake. I'm pretty much required to make this for family gatherings. My father-in-law, who generally doesn't eat dessert because of health concerns, always has a big slice.

Haven't tried this recipe yet but have made a few flourless cakes in my time. In response to Pastryman from Boston. All flourless chocolate cakes will crack, and fall after removing from oven. The solution is to let the cake cool until it's barely warm, then push sides down until they are level with the middle of the cake. Simply garnish with sifted powdered sugar. Voila!

I'm not a cake lover..but this is so much better. Best to make ahead a day or two, it almost begins to set ..and the flavor and texture are so improved. Very heavy and lovely. A sliver with goat milk icecream?

Just O.K. Most of my guests thought the dried cherries were raisins. There are much better recipes for flourless chocolate torts(like Passover Chocolate Torte with Raspberry Sauce, Bon Appetite, April 1999). I would not make this again.

I made this cake for a large party, and everyone asked for the recipe. It was so popular that I made it again the next day. Make this cake is easy and enjoyable. I decorated the top with edible flowers to make it look prettier.

Fantastic! This is one of the most popular desserts in NYC right now and this recipe measures up! Served warm with hazelnut ice cream on the side... perfect. I will definitely make again, maybe even this week...

I loved the deep flavor of this cake, and the cherries were a nice surprise. Mine cracked on top, too, but I covered it with a dusting of powdered sugar and some fresh cherries.

I made this in muffin pans to take on a picnic, and it was a great success, everyone had their own little chocolate cake, and there was no slicing or messy handling. I have also made this with good quality candied oranges chopped instead of the cherries, and used grand marnier to complement.

THIS WAS A RECIPE THAT WAS ALOT OF WORK FOR A LITTLE BIT OF PLEASURE.IT WAS MOST UPSETTING. THE COOKING TIME ON THE CAKE WAS A BIT LENGTHY. CAKE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COOKED ABOUT 33 MINUTES, IT ROSE REAL WELL TO ABOUT 3.5" WHILE IT WAS COOLING IT BEGAN TO DEFLATE. IT LOOKED LIKE A TIRE THAT HAD BLOWN OUT. WOULD NOT MAKE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS.

I couldn't wait for this cake to cool! This cake is just right with a dusting of power sugar for a decortive presentation. Don't be alarmed if the cake falls and cracks slightly after it cools. The powder sugar dusting covers this up. All my guests raved how this cake was not overboard on chocolate yet it will satisfy the biggest chocolate fan. This cake kept well for up to 4 days wrapped in plastic.
