I thought I would make this recipe because I wanted to make a quicker version of a stovetop recipe. This recipe turned out to be sweet rice soup. I even added eggs and could not get it to thicken. The taste is wonderful, and it was quicker than my usual recipe, but I have yet to find a truely thick stovetop rice pudding recipe.And by the way....I left out the salt!!

Did I miss something? This was way too salty, and not all at creamy. With less salt, it would have tasted like pleasantly sweetened rice, without any trace of pudding consistency. The tropical fruit was a nice touch, and I'll try adding it to another rice pudding recipe next time.
