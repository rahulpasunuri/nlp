I have never been to Trinidad so sorry but don't really care about the authenticity just looking for good food. We used tilapia and garlic mayo from this recipe and it was really good, not to mention super easy. Teenagers loved it which is sometimes tricky with fish.

I have to agree with my fellow trinbagonians here... this is a poor sub just from reading the recipe. Pitas can never EVER be compared to a fried bake as well as the fishes. Andrew Z had it right from Richard's on Maracas beach. Unfortunately, authenticity cannot be replaced here.

I did not make this, so I can't review. However, I wanted comment. I saw a Shark and Bake in an old Savoy mag years ago and thought it sounded awesome. I made it, fairly close to the Trini version. I can't see how you can substitute for shark or pita for the bake. That is like substituting ground beef for steak and white bread for a roll in a Philly Cheese Steak. It sounds pretty good, but it is not a Shark and Bake. The Andrew Zimmern review says it all.

Simple and delicious- I used mango chutney with a dab of hot pepper sauce, cucumbers, tomatoes, purple onion and lettuce with tilapia.

While this may not be authentic, we really enjoyed the flavor and the fun of adding toppings. The marinade made the fish fantastically flavorful, but I've got to find a better bread though as the brand in most stores simply falls apart.

I made this with tilapia fillets. The store-bought pita I used was not a reasonable substitute for real bake, and tilapia--a fish I generally like--didn't work well as a substitute for shark. I didn't care for the result.

I have to agree with A Cook From Trinidad. This "adaptation is all kinds of wrong. Call it caribbean fish pockets if you must. NOT shark and bake. Watch Andrew Zimmern from Bizarre foods when he eats this sandwich. And see what it really looks like.

No no no!!! Its called shark and bake for a reason... You MUST use shark! The taste of shark is incredible! Bake is in the name because thats what you sandwich the shark in... BAKE! Fried bake to be specific! Oh fadda! This recipe is just wrong! I'm sure the taste of the fish is decent but don't deconstruct perfection nuh!

One of our favorite dishes to make. We have made a few modificatons: instead of pita we use spinach wraps and instead of lettuce we use shredded cabbage and squeeze lime juice on the cabbage once it is in the wrap-it is awesome!!! And my husband made up a sauce to put on top: half cup of greek yougurt, lemon juice, and thyme. That's it. We love it!

Absolutely fantastic!

Easy and good. I used whole wheat pitas and liked the added flavor they provided. For those mentioning making the recipe with shark - please do a little research into what over-fishing has done to shark populations worldwide. Not to mention that shark contains some of the highest levels of mercury of any fish. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has an excellent Seafood Watch program full of information about best seafood choices.

PITA bread???? NO WAY! Bake and Shark has nothing to do with pita bread. The bake must be made fresh ( and is NOTHING like pita bread )

Easy and incredibly tasty! There's just something about the hot crispy shark, the cool mango (I use fresh mango-peach salsa) and the pocket bread that make this sandwich about as much messy fun as a body can have. I now haunt seafood aisles looking for shark -- and pounce when I find it because it means another opportunity to make this fabulous meal!

Loved it! My modifications: I used habanero chilis in adobo sauce in the marinade; added a bit of fresh cilantro; used tilapia. I then lightly fried the fish and served it with tortillas to make fish tacos I also served homemade salsa, spanish rice and black beans. It's now one of our favorite meals!

Thanks for the recipe. I know how good this can be having been to T&T numerous time to get the real thing. Every time I went I had to go to the Maracas Bay beach to have at least two Shark and Bake sandwiches and wash them down with a Carib or two. Being also a purist I do not like using pita bread as a substitute for the real thing. The only time I duplicated it at home after coming back from Trinidad I made the dough and fried the bake. To me one reason Shark and Bake is so good is because every ingredient is fresh and made on the spot. It has to be consumed on the spot also. I brought one once from the beach to the airport one hour later. It already became soggy and wasn't as good anymore. Shark and bake used to cost $6 TT ($2) the first time I went to Trinidad in 1999. Three years ago it cost $14 TT. Don't know how much it cost now.

I am using this fish recipe everytime i fry fish. I used an entire harbanero (i love the heat) and cod. It was simple, easy and very yummy.

Excellent! I used catfish and for condiments I used mustard, pickled cucumber slices, onions, tomatoes, and hot sauce. Instead of making the lime marinade, I used mojo sauce from the grocery store. Instead of pita, I used wraps so they were like fish tacos. Full of flavor.

My husband and I loved it! We saw one of the hosts on the travel channel eat this on a show on Trinidad and just had to find the recipe. Very very good! Definately use the mango chutney, trust the recipe! It's so good!

I thought this was a fun dish for a casual dinner party. Prep can be done ahead of time. It made a beautiful presentation on the table. Yum!

I ws lazy and didn't feel like chopping -- made a double recipe and threw the marinade ingredients in the blender. Really nice flavor; we'll definitely make it again.

Excellent! Used Tilapia (no shark here.) Mango Chutney a must!

Based on other reviews, served this on foccacia rolls with hot mango chutney, lettuce, pappadew peppers and sliced red onion. Great flavors, nice and spicy! Will certainly make again.

My friend likewise does not like fish and enjoyed this and what I did with leftovers. But I did have a few recipe changes: I had a beauitful shark steak (cut into strips) that another friend had caught, and based on the other advice, used long chunks of French bread to make a sandwich that would stay together. Leftover shark: perfect for a seafood pasta sauce the next night, with just a can of crushed tomato, 2 cloves garlic, salt, pepper, a sprinkle of dried basil and a handfull of torn fresh basil leaves. All the spicy peppers and marinade that sticks to the fish/shark makes the sauce lovely as it simmers while the pasta cooks.

Tasty good; my wife, who isn't too big on fish, actually liked it. The mango chutney is a must.

We loved this recipe. I have made it twice and will definitely make it again. I used honey mustard and mango chutney as condiments and included cucumber along with the tomato, red onion and lettuce. The second time I made it I used whole wheat hamburger buns rather than pita pockets (which fell apart and made a mess).
