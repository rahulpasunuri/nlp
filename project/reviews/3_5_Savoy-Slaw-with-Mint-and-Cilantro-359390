Needed more punch but then it was really terrific - added an extra 2 tbs. of rice vinegar and a tsp. of lime juice. It was a great with roasted duck - cut the more greasey texture of the duck.

I have made this twice in 4 days! Love it. The sesame oil adds a nice flavor.

Fresh, colorful, and just the right amount of sweet and heat. I served it with these pork chops and thought it made a nice combination: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/v iews/Grilled-Spiced-Double-Thick-Pork- Chops-15280.

A little disappointed the slaw didn't have more flavor. Perhaps it is too early in the season for my mint and cilantro to add the necessary flavor.

This is really good with burgers - tastes better the next day of course!

this was DELICIOUS and extremely fresh tasting. only 4 forks if you have a food processor, which makes the shredding a 60 second breeze, otherwise, the prep may knock it down a fork.

Loved this. I served the chilies on the side for those who can not eat spicy

This was a really refreshing summer salad (albeit a little labour intensive) that I would make again. I used regular new green cabbage instead of Savoy but otherwise made no changes to the recipe. The radish and the chiles added a little heat to the salad but not so much that family members who don't care for hot and spicy foods didn't enjoy it.
