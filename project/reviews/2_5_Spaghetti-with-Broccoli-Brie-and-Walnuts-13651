OK I didn't actually make this recipe, but I used it for inspiration. I mixed about 1 cup of chopped walnuts, a round of brie, without rind, and 1/2 cup carmelized onions to make a filling for ravioli (dough made out of 2 eggs and 2 cups flour). I served the ravioli with roasted red pepper sauce. Very yummy.

I liked this, but my husband didn't so I won't make it again. I made it with 4 oz. of brie because I thought that 8 oz. was too much for two people. I think, thought, that it needed the full 8 oz. in order to work. Less cheese made for less flavor. I think this has the potential for tasting like grown up maccaroni and cheese, but it needs that full 8 oz. of cheese.

After reading the other comments left about this recipe, I decided to exchange the brie for garlic-and-herb feta and a new cheese I discovered at the market, myzithra, for a more Mediterranean feel (and I couldn't afford the brie, being a college student; I also didn't use the walnuts for the same reason). It turned out alright, though for more garlic flavour I recommend putting garlic powder in the spaghetti water as it boils. I cut it down to a smaller, two-portion size, and it made a decent lunch. I think this probably shouldn't be a main dish, but rather should be converted to a side dish with, say, liver and onions, and using perhaps angel hair instead of spaghetti. Still, good basis!

DON'T try this recipe with spinach pasta. Mine turned out terribly. I look forward to re-trying the recipe with regular spaghetti.

This recipe is a good base to start from, but I added pesto, pine nuts, shrimp, and red pepper flakes to it. It was delicious!

AFter reading the reviews, I made this bolder by adding more garlic and a bolder olive oil to the broccoli,I tossed in some chives, lemon peel and a few Italian pickled onions. Much better in my view.

Did not like this recipe. I didn't use enough brie (as others suggested), but even so it was fairly tasteless. Yuck!

A little rich for my taste. I definitely recommend cutting down on the brie; I really love brie, but after a while, it was too much.

I agree. This wasn't the best. Maybe if you added crushed red peppers or something to liven it up it would be better.

I have to agree that this dish was bland and disappointing. Maybe if the nuts were candied, or if the broccoli was marinated or sauteed in something with a lot of flavor it would be better. There weren't any ingredients in this dish that ended up being the bursts of flavor I usually look forward to in pasta dishes.

To the cook from Vancouver: Shouldn't you review the recipe and not the other cooks?

So-so. Bland and a bit bitter. Not quite what I was hoping, since I adore brie, and even if I tweaked the ingredients, I still don't think this would rate as a stellar recipe. Too basic in flavors but maybe for novice cooks this is living!

This was awesome and a great different way to use brie! I cut back on almost all of the ingredients, after reading the reviews.I only used about 1/3 of the brie, and it was perfect, melted great and wasn't too rich like everyone said it was with the full amount. It was great the way the brie melted into the pasta! I also used way less walnuts. And I used just enough broccoli for 2 servings, not 1 1/2 lb! I will make this again for sure!! YUM!

Amazing! I loved this recipe and will make it again. It definitely serves more than two people, especially since it's so rich.

Nice alternate use of brie. Rather rich. Be sure to cut brie into small chunks or it won't melt completely into a sauce. Leftovers are delicious, even cold.

Very nice. Not too rich, and the flavors blend well. Not special enough for company.

This dish is pretty good, easy and unusual, too. Pretty rich.
