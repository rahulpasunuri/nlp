In an effort to recreate a Warm Cabbage Salad that I had at a local restaurant, I added mushrooms cooked until they had just released their liquid, subsituted Napa cabbage for the green, substituted red wine and red wine vinegar for the white, and omitted the cream. It was delicious and the family was disappointed that there wasn't more.

Really easy and delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving which worked well because usually no one really cares about a mixed greean salad with all the other decadent food. Next time I would cut the cabbage in smaller pieces.

I fully agree with "A Cook from California on 08/01/01 ": this is a very strange dish indeed. My girlfriend found it bland, too crunchy and...disgusting! Reading all the rave reviews this dish is getting I think that it must be an aquired taste. I'll probably doo a small quantity again, just to check if I didn't miss something.

I should have made more! I made this to go with corned beef for a St. Patricks day poker game and it was a nice compliment. I did not cook the cabbage since I thought that would make it more like a side dish than a salad. I dressed the cabbage in advance with the wine vinegar and some of the bacon grease giving it a slightly wilted, but still crunchy texture. Great taste and simple.

This recipe was tasty and it offered a nice change of pace from the usual side dishes. It is a nice fall/winter side especially. The bacon blended well with the cabbage. I had roquefort cheese on hand but decided not to use because it would have made the dish a little too heavy for me. Would definitely make again!

After reading the great reviews of this recipe, I thought that I would give it a try. I gave it my best shot and followed the recipe exactly. Well, both my boyfriend and I thought that it was not all that. I love cabbage, cream, and blue cheese, but the combinations are just disgusting. Now the majority still rules but I gotta tell you, this was a waste of time and money. Sorry, but I will never make this again. By the way, Thank you epicurious for all of the effort that you put into this site. It is the most incredible site that exists on the www!

Very flavorful. True comfort food. I used a mix of purple and green cabbage and it looked very nice. Like the other reviewer, I cooked all of the cabbage at once and then added the cream and cheese. This was better reheated the next day (who would have guessed!)

Great delicate and still hearty recipe for the first snow of October in Québec!! I substituted Old Cheddar to Roquefort which I didn't have on hand. Wouldn't mix the cheese in, another time, but just sprinkle it on top with the bacon. The salad keeps more finesse this way. Great dish!!!

We really loved this. Do not salt to taste, as the cheese and bacon provide enough salt. Next time I make this, I may add a green apple or two, towards the end of the recipe. I think that would really add to its taste.

This is the perfect heartwarming dish!---I crave it as soon as the cold weather sets in. No need to split ingredients in half--I put it all in a large pot at once. Really great!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. My husband and I enjoyed the salad so much we took our son and his wife to the City Cafe when we visited them in Dallas to thank the owner for sharing this recipe with Gourmet. As another reader noted, anything with bacon, cream, and blue cheese has got to be wonderful. I know this recipe certainly is.

I made this as part of St. Patrick's dinner and it was a big hit! Everyone loved it, even the kids who were there. Of course, most anything would taste good with bacon, cream, and blue cheese on it! It will definitely stay in my recipe box.
