How do they get 29 grams of fat per serving when it takes only 2 tsp of oil plus some spray? Skinless breasts are low fat, tortillas have a little fat, Greek yogurt was nonfat..... This makes no sense at all. There isn't even any cheese listed. What am I missing?

know better than to waste these perfectly good ingredients by baking them. The whole idea of fajitas is the charred, grilled flavor. This can also be obtained by high-heat saute. I cannot understand why anyone would employ this method of cooking fajitas. What's the point?

I thought these fajitas were yummy. Even though they don't have the crispy, grilled taste of "real" fajitas, and I agree with another reviewer that they were a bit wet, I'm forgiving and would make them again, as they were simple to make and pretty yummy.

If it's not grilled, it's not fajitas.

I haven't tried this yet.. but based on the other review, I think I might try grilling the chicken and veggies, rather than baking.

The flavor is OK but it didn't create the nice smokey charred bits that make fajitas so delicious. This was a tad wet.
