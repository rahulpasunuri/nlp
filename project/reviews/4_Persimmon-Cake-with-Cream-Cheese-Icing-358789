This turned out delicious! 1 and 1/2 cups of persimmon puree is 4 persimmons. I did not use the brandy so 5 persimmons would have added more moisture. I did not even make the icing but I am sure that would also have been delicious.

I made this cake exactly as directed and my entire family found it to be delicious.

Beautiful cake! Persimmons were new to me, but they are totally lovely (hubby likens the puree to nectarines). I made a half recipe as I had only 3/4 cup of puree and made them as mini muffins (yield: 24) which baked for 14 minutes. Note: to do this remember to use 1 1/2 eggs (not 2) or 78 g of egg total. I would happily make these again; the toasted pecans complement the spice perfectly.

Cake was divine - I baked it as a layer cake and used the Barefoot Contessa Cream Cheese frosting with some extra toasted pecans on top of the cake for decoration and crunch.

3.5 forks. A great recipe that is just lovely and a wonderful way to use persimmons. I was making this for a potluck where there would be small children, so I omitted the the brandy-soaked currants, and also the nuts (for those with allergies). Despite these omissions, the cake was still quite enjoyable, and in fact, I may make these same omissions the next time around. Instead of a large cake, I made bite-sized cupcakes and, like the other reviewer, topped with a cream cheese frosting instead of icing. While they're not mindblowing, I did find myself sneaking more than my fair share. Overall, they're a great spiced cake that is perfect for fall.

Had some organic Fuyu persimmons I needed to do something with and found this recipe. The flesh was not soft, so cooked it with the whiskey for about 10 minutes and threw in some raisins as I did not have currants. Then, pureed it all in the food processor. This cake turned out better than I had imagined. It's just perfect for a blustery fall day. Taking some to my mother-in-law so I can score some big points. This cake will definitely make all my sisters-in-law jealous of my baking skills!

used whole wheat pastry flour and slightly reduced sugar. It was a great hit with friends and family.

I admittedly halved this recipe and omitted the currants (but NOT the whiskey, thank you very much), but it still turned out delicious. Spicy, buttery, moist, perfect. I opted for cupcakes with the cream cheese frosting (omitting the water) and YUM. Perfect for fall. Not sure how David could get persimmons in April (even--or especially--in Paris!)...
