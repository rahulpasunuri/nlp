I live in North America, Montreal to be exact, and I have worked in a "Spanish Resto" for many years, and people from Spain are always saying that the food here in North America doesn't compare to the food in Spain. Well, I've made the tuna empanadas for the resto and the Spaniards loved them! I like them a lot as well and have made them at home many times. The difference in peoples experiences with the recipe may lie in the quality of the ingredients they have used. Personally, I favour red peppers over green ones in most things I make. Also really ripe tomatoes and a Vidallia onion make all the difference. A few times I have added Spanish olives to the recipe in place of the proscuitto which also works quite well!

Galician empanadas still use traditional empanada dough; you don't need puff pastry. I have a version on my blog that's made entirely from pantry staples - you don't even need the fresh pepper. http://quipstravailsandbraisedoxtails.blogspot.com/2010/05/empanadas-de-atun-latin-style-tuna-fish.html

Not bad. Looks like a nice dish. This site has a great version of this recipe www.entertainingrecipes.org

This was okay but nothing special. Everybody ate it, no complaints but no compliments either. I would only make again if puff pasty was on a really good sale. Than again, I would probably make something else involving puff pastry.

We loved this recipe and it vanished in minutes. Buy decent tuna in oil as the taste is better. made it as is and already want tomake it again - perhaps with a salad this time as a main course.

To all the cooks that disagree with this being the original recipe: Would you mind posting your recipe? I would love to try the authentic recipe. I'm from Argentina and I ate different types of empanadas while I was growing up, including tuna.

Well you can call this EMPANADA but it is Not the original Empanada Gallega Please check before you give names to your recipies i would make my empanada with the proper ingredients that they use in Spain

A giant puff-pastry empanada stuffed with tuna was certainly a novel idea for us. My husband exclaimed "this is delicious!" when he first bit in, but I think it could use a little work. I think I would like more vegetables and less tuna. The idea is good enough to be worth a little tinkering, and of course a recipe such as this is easy to alter to one's taste. I cut the recipe in half with no problems.

Empanada galega with puff pastry..?? No, no, no. The dough is supposed to be made with flour, eggs, water, yeast, and not be allowed time to rise, only during cooking. Also, the filling is to be coloured yellow by adding a bit of saffron. My Grandma is from Santiago de Compostela and empanada is something I've been having since forever.

I live in Spain and ave eaten this empanada many times, but this is the first time I've ever heard of adding serrano ham. Another thing, usually eggs are coasely chopped instead of sliced, but that's up to each person I suppose. Pastry tastes better if made from scratch leaving a general better taste to empanada as dough is made with olive oil and white wine mixed with flour. That's the secret!

Tuna empanada with eggs is one of those things you had to grow up with...I did! and haven't had a Empanada Gallega in too long. I'm making it this weekend, can't wait!

I really wanted to love this dish but it was merely okay. I understand that the inclusion of boiled eggs in the empanada is traditional but they did nothing for the overall flavour and the egg whites became unpleasantly rubbery after baking. Personally, I would have preferred to have eaten that lovely (and expensive) Spanish tuna mounded on a slice of grilled crusty bread with heirloom tomato slices and a drizzle of Spanish olive oil rather than waste my time with this preparation.
