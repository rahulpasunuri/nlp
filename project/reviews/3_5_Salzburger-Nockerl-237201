ERROR IN SALT MEASUREMENT: The original recipe in Gourmet Magazine calls for 1/8 tsp salt. (I just consulted the magazine, which I still have.) The recipe on Epicurious calls for 3/4 tsp (6 TIMES the required amount). Typically my children devour this dish -- but not today when I referred to Epicurious's version. The pancake was much too salty to eat.

Wow, this is one awesome recipe. I am most definietly going to make this again. Very light and creamy. It's hard finding one of these that aren't to over-powering but this one just has the perfect combo.

This recipe is so easy... much more simple than the traditional Austrian recipe I have. It tastes JUST like the soufflé at the Cafe Getridegasse in Salzburg (my husband's favorite spot in our home-away-from-home). They serve it with two spoons for a couple to share. You can find the sauce on the canned fruit aisle near the cranberry sauce (or try the IKEA food section... Lingonberry sauce is Swedish...Preiselbeeren in German). Thanks Gourmet for this awesome recipe!

Having made this recipe, I am tempted to cook it at 375 for 17 minutes. I also used blueberry preserves, with good results.

I have a question -- does the meringue soak up the cream at the bottom or is it still there at the bottom of the pie plate??? I am thinking of making this and adding fresh berries over the jam.
