Tho' labor intensive, this is the best dressing /stuffing I have ever had or made. I don't stuff it, I make it as a side in a large pan, and enjoy it with other meats, or on it's own for lunch or light supper. A perfect and delish serving of the nutritious kale and sweet potato. I've made this for several years at Thanksgiving, and look foreward to it as the favorite TDay dish.

This is ridiculously good. Made it as written, and can't get enough!

This is absolutely a recipe to use again and again. It gets rave reviews year after year from my Thanksgiving guests. It has many steps to prepare, but it is so worth the trouble! I have occasionally opted for just regular cornbread (instead of making it with the sweet potatoes) and adding a few more cubed sweet potatoes to the mixture. It still came out beautiful and tasty.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is the most demanded side dish at my Thanksgiving parties. As with all stuffing recipes, this one is versatile, and you should give it your own personal touches. I have made it so many times, that I have altered it in several ways over the years. It is a great starting point. When rushed, I have not bothered making the "sweet potato cornbread" and have used plain cornbread to save time. Also, I love making this with sweet italian sausage instead of bacon. I don't ever recall using the vinegar, but I do use the honey. You can use pecans or substitute sauteed wild mushrooms (which I often do). I would NEVER use canned broth (unless in a crunch). I usually make a big pot of turkey or duck broth in advance of Thanksgiving. These provide a very rich base. And I usually make this with collards and/or mustard greens and have never used the kale or swiss chard. Adding butter along with the eggs makes the dish richer, but more caloric and fatty. It's worth it though. Perhaps having grown up in the South makes me partial to this dish and somewhat of an authority in making cornbread stuffing. But this recipe has universal appeal. Experiment people!

I made this recipe for the second time this thanksgiving. While my guests adored it last year, I didn't like the original recipe because it was too sweet. I prefer salty-brothy stuffing. So, I eliminated about 1/2 the honey and all of the cider vinegar. I also sauteed some minced garlic along with the potatoes and used mild sage sausage rather than bacon (which I discarded). The results were outstanding! This is a great concept.

I wish I'd read the other reviews. This is bad. I used it in a chicken instead of a turkey, and ended up just throwing it away. EEeeeewwww. If there were a zero-star rating I would give it that.

This stuffing took so long to make, I actually didn't finish it until after Thanksgiving dinner (because of the time to make the homemade corn bread). After all that, it didn't taste so good. Definitely not worth it.

This dish was a little sweet for me. It may have been the apple cider vinegar or maybe the honey. I would cut back on both next time. I can see where this would be an excellent recipe but maybe just not for me.
