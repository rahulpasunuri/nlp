The dressing sounded great- but was atrocious. When cooked down, the carrot juice was overpoweringly sweet.

I didn't like this at all- I think maybe it was the dressing. It was watery and not very flavorful, despite the cumin. And the fact that it was electric orange in addition to that didn't help...

Very easy to make and tasty.
