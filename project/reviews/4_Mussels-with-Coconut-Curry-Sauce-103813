A few years back on a ski trip to Vermont we had these amazing mussels...so when I got home I tried to see if I could find something like it. This must be the same exact recipe and I've been making it for years. Make this exactly as is...I found no need at all for adjustments. And make sure you have plenty of bread...the sauce is delicious!

I found this recipe today, and made it tonight. I followed the advice and added more curry, some sea salt, and garlic. I also added prawns and served over jasmine rice. It was so good! Even my husband loved it, and he isnt to hot on seafood. I will make this again for sure. Great for an easy dinner party. BV Pinot Grigio paired very well with this.

4 forks with a few changes. I would have to give it a 2 1/2 if as is. As others mentioned, I felt that it was too acidic. To cut the acidity, 1/8 cup of brown sugar and some sea salt (as mentioned by another reviewer) as well as 1/4 cup of half and half. Next time I will add less lemon, maybe 2 tablespoons vs. 3. We also added fennel which we absoulutely love. The flavor in this dish is incredible and it added a little texture to the sauce as well as a slightly sweet flavor which we also felt helped with the acidity. It was excellent with those small changes. I may have been able to add just the half and half, but tried the other reviewers trick first which definitely helped, but still felt that I needed to soften it more, which is why I added the half and half. If you don't have brown sugar, you can try the half and half first and see if it helps. Obviously, everyone's tastes are different, so you might have to play with the proportion of each of the ingredients. Seriously excellent dish with only a few minor changes!

I made this recipe last night for Valentine's. It was amazing, nevertheless I would like to note some suggested alterations which I tried. The wine does result in an acidic taste which I had to remedy with salt and organic brown sugar (just a 1/4 cup of sugar and salt to taste.) I would bet that using a sweeter white wine would remedy the situation. Another suggestion would be to thicken the sauce once the mussels are out for longer than this recipe calls for. Other than that, we enjoyed our mussels and will make this recipe again!

Great! Wouldn't change a thing, other than perhaps keep a better eye on the mussels so as not to overcook.

My husband I love this recipe. I've made it a few times now and it's our favourite mussel recipe. It's easy to make and mussels are always available and fairly inexpensive. I cook it exactly like the recipe. I find that the acidity of the wine and lemon do not bother me at all after the mussels and sauce are cooked. I love lemon. I agree with other reviewers and would not recommend using light coconut milk.

An excellent recipe. My girlfriend lives in Marin and we drove an hour to the coast in time for low tide and picked plenty of mussels. We used regular curry powder and added Kaffir lime along with the parsley. Very satisfying on a cold, wintry evening.

This tasted almost exactly like a dish I paid $12 for at a local restaurant. It was fantastic. As a guidenote, if you use Lite Coconut Milk, you'll want to add a little less lemon juice, or a little more oil, as the lack of cream turns the broth a little too acidic. And don't be afraid to put in as much curry powder as you like! 2 tbsp is fine, but I prefer about 3.

impressive but easy. the most labor intensive part of this dish is debearding and cleaning the mussels. the sauce is light and flavorful. i wound up adding a little extra coconut milk, because the sauce seemed a bit too acidic with the wine and lemon. we served it over homemade lemon fettucini, and the flavors were divine. we experimented with wine pairings, and while both red and white worked with the dish, i think i preferred the pinot gris. the sauvignon blanc was a bit to bitter for the dish and the red--while it brought out the heat in the curry--mixed with the mussels to create a very sweet taste. super yummy. i wish i'd taken pictures.

I used this recipe to make a coconut curry w/ noodles and frozen veggies (no mussels) and it was out of this world. I didn't have any wine or shallots on hand so I substituted a little sherry vinegar and lots of garlic. I made my own curry powder to taste by rooting around my spice rack. Yum! The coconut and lemon juice go so well together--I never knew.

Absolutely fantastic. Served with french bread and the thai cucumber salad from this website. Phenomenal, superb, highly recommend both meals. I made them both just as the recipies state.

I added some lime juice, fish sauce and cilantro to give a greater Southeast Asian flavor and served the dish over angel hair pasta, since that's what I had on hand. All in all, it was a very tasty dish that I'd make again.

I make this dish every year as an appetizer for New Years Eve. It is very quick and easy. Every year someone calls me and reminds me to make it. Our circle of friends would not consider NYE to be complete without it. I always make sure to have a bagette so people can sop up the sauce. There's never a drop left.

The wine smell was so strong (Sauvignon Blanc) + aged curry spice, so I added an extra 1/2 T. of curry. This was very different for my traditional Chinese family, who dsn't see much curry.

Fantastic Dish every one enjoyed it and they poured the sauce over the lemon angel hair pasta that I made. I used 3 lbs of P.E.I. Mussels and I changed the curry to 1 and 1/2 tablespoons and added a tablespoon of palm sugar. I used a lovely 2002 Bodega Lurton Mendozza Pinot Gris in it, and served it with a 2001 Jackson Triggs Gewurztraminer. Super Super Super!!!!!

The basic ingredients were good except for the 3 Tbs. of lemon juice which made it too tart. I had to start over. I left out the lemon juice. I used 3/4 c. of white wine & 3/4 c. of chicken broth and I substituted 1 Tbs. red curry paste for 1 Tbs. of the curry powder.

What a wonderful summer evening appetizer. I made this for my family and they loved it. I followed the recipe exact! I don't think I would change a thing except cook double next time! Watch out...your guest will be drinking the broth from the bowl!

I thought the sauce was very bland---I admit I didn't use the wine, but I don't think that was it. I decided to add fish sauce and brown sugar, which many other coconut curry sauces call for. Next time, I would even use more curry powder. With all those changes, it was REALLY good, but without it, very bland....

I used lowfat coconut milk which left the sauce a little acidic. I evened it out with butter, but beware. My roommate and I really enjoyed the dish over rice.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dish - I figured we would have leftovers since I usually don't care for mussels - WRONG! My husband and I fought over them! The broth is delicious and makes a terrific dip for bread. I didn't have the Madras curry & only used 1 tblsp. - was just right. Also, I substituted light coconut milk - it was delicious!

Terrific mussel dish - even my typically non-mussel eating wife gobbled these down. We substituted coconut cream for the milk and didn't have any shallots and the dish was still delicious. The mussels REALLY absorb the flavors - they end up sweet and spicy at the same time. Don't skimp on the curry - it's not overpowering. Will definitely make again.
