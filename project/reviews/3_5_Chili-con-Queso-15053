I can't wait to try out this recipe for the Red Sox season opener. I did want to give a shout-out to the reviewer below who mentioned the dip made with a can of no-bean chili and a brick of cream cheese. I did this for the Super Bowl today (after running out of time to prepare a proper chili con queso), and it was a delicious indulgence that even my health nut father couldn't help but gobble up. The whole point of these types of recipes is to enjoy falling off the nutrition-wagon once in a while, and if you can't handle the thought of that...you might consider another recipe.

This is some fantastic comfort food. Creamy, cheesy, a little bit spicy, and the perfect consistency. And yes, folks, it's because of the lowbrow, unglamorous, shelf-stable-might-not- even-really-be-classified-as-cheese VELVEETA listed in the ingredients. The only way around it is to start by standing around whisking up a Bechamel over your hot stove to use as the base, and then add cheese, chiles and spices. But, really. We're not entertaining the Queen of England, we're just eating some chips and queso.

What is up with all the reviewers giving it two stars and complaining about the velveeta. Do you not know what Velveeta is? One reviewer from dallas proposed a recipe with regular cheese dip. YEAH, if I wanted that, I would have searched for it. Someone else substitued regular cheese for the velveeta and didn't understand why there was so much oil and no consistency. Again, that's a different recipe b/c velveeta is not real cheese. It's a "cheese product" from Kraft. THIS RECIPE IS CLASSIC JUNK FOOD. EVALUATE IT AS SUCH. Many variations on this recipe by using beans or different types of chopped chili mixes.

I made this recipe back in 1998 when Colby was an exotic cheese to me and I'd never realized they sold plastic cheese bricks that were pretty addictive. We enjoyed it but post enligtenment around the advent of Lipitor (which is probably made by Velveeta) a coworker told me about a way yummier dip that seems like the lesser of 2 evils healthwise it's one can of chili no beans to 1 8oz package of cream cheese melted together. People go crazy for it when asked for the recipe I change the subject!!!!

After reading the reviews, I opted against using Velveeta for this recipe and instead went with mostly colby-jack and some cheddar. The results were unexpected: when melted, the cheese formed a disgusting blob that was not at all suitable for queso. With little time to improvise further, I went back to the author's recommendation and bought some velveeta. The taste was less desirable, but the cheese melted perfectly. I added fresh salsa, an onion, cayenne, black beans, and topped with scoops of mashed avocado. It was a hit.

I would find it hard to believe that most everyone can not find a use for this recipe at some point (even the cheese snobs). I like good cheese and was a bit skeptical of the crisco and velveeta, but made if for my 9 year old sons birthday. The boys, my husband, and 7 year old daughter devoured it. I thought it was OK, but as I said earlier I am a cheese snob.

There is a recipe on Epicurious for "Old-Fashioned" Peanut Butter Cookies. When one reads the reviews for them, there are many reviewers who have made modifications to the recipe to make the cookies "chewy." I was a bit surprised by this. Those of us who have a few years remember a time before "Soft Batch." Cookies were generally crunchy unless they had been cooked wrong. Peanut Butter cookies were always crisp! Even in the school cafeteria. I think that's what we have here. This is a recipe from a generation when simple, fast, and who-cared-about- health ruled. Lighten up. This is Judy's "Chicken and Dumplings," "Pot Roast," or "Meat Loaf." It's a memory in her mind, the smells of which take her to a happier time. I plan to try this and I am certain I will enjoy it as it will take me to a happier and simpler time.

Can the people who have not made the recipe stop adding forked reviews and their comments? How obnoxious.

O.K. Some of these reviewers need to seriously lighten up. This is comfort food. Different criteria apply. I too had something so similar to this in El Paso. Yes, Epicurious is generally more highbrow than this, but seriously we ALL like to go home once in a while.

I made this recipe last weekend minus the Crisco and with 2 extra tablespoons of salsa. It was a huge hit -- even my half-Mexican husband gave it the thumbs up.

This recipe is nearly identical (minus the Crisco) to the one my Hispanic son-in-law from El Paso makes. It is delicious! The cook is sharing her special food memories along with the ingredients. I think the rude reviews are mean-spirited.

YUCK! I have to agree with most of the other one fork reviews - Velveeta & Crisco?!?!?! That's disgusting! If you want a quick fix (although not inspiring), then I would just use the Velveeta & add salsa, garlic, and green chilies, but definitely skip the Crisco. For authentic queso I use 1 c. real American cheese, 1/2 c. sharp cheddar, 1/4 c. cream, diced tomato, chopped green chili (I use roasted hatch green chilies - this makes a huge difference in the taste), and minced garlic. Although, I might try the suggestions from A Cook from Dallas w/ onion and cumin.

Being from Tex Mex Country, to be fair, this probably would do for most guys enjoying a football game and they wouldn't realize it was Velveeta and Crisco. But, why not take them beyond what doesn't taste much better than cheap, bottled queso and use real cheese and eliminate the greasy tasteless Crisco? Substitute the Velveeta for real American cheese or Monterrey Jack. Melt in a double broiler. Add milk, onions, jalapenos, petite cut skinned diced tomatoes (with a Mexican flair) some fresh diced garlic and some cumin, and S&P to taste. Serve in a fondue pot and Mmmm, real queso without the Crisco and fake cheese. Epicurious is a play on Epicurean, which means the devoted pursuit of wordly pleasures - especially to the enjoyment of good food and comfort. It means to take it beyond the junk food you get at a low rate restaurant or on the discount aisle at the grocery store. This recipe should be removed!

Very good. I increased the salsa and omitted the chilis. I choose the 4 forks even though my heart said 3. I did this to even the rating for those who judge but do not try the recipe. Please don't do that!

Forget the fat, forget the snobbery about Velveeta - this comes closest to the "Skillet Queso" you can get at Chiles Restaurant! (add some browned ground beef and you're there.) This is always a huge hit at any football or Tex-Mex related party.

Recipe was great. Don't worry about the Crisco! Everyone loved this dip and it was gone in no time. I added a little extra cayenne pepper to punch up the spice. The original recipe was a little tame for my taste. Try it! You'll get great reviews!

Yee-haw! This recipe was the best and can be used for most anything. It's great to dip your chicken McNuggets into, as well as for those stale french fries that have fallen between the cushions of the sofa and need some extra "umph" when once found again. And for the Mac'n'cheeses. . . don't even let me go there! Let's just say, "yummy."

A big hit at our family party. I used 4T of Fresh Tomato Salsa (also on Epicurious). My brother-in-law said it's the best queso he's ever had. (Quite a compliment, considering he's from south Texas and is anti-Crisco and Velveeta.) A nice treat for special occasions.

i am sooooo tired of people giving their input when they have not tried the recipe! the rating system is intended to rate how well you liked or disliked the recipe, any tips you may have, etc. please keep your closed minded opinions to yourself unless you have tried the recipe and remember - DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU'VE TRIED IT!!!!

I tried the recipe and it was AWESOME. I don't understand why everyone else is giving it 1 fork.

this has got to be one of the most disgusting recipes I have ever read. Velveeta is bad enough...but Crisco...*barf* And only 1 tablespoon of salsa? this sounds like a recipe for those on...like...wierd restricted diets. Good lord, people, the fifties are long gone. Time to stop cooking like it.

Hey, when Velveeta's the foundation of the recipe, all bets are off.

CRISCO!!!! Just the thought of putting Crisco in Chili Con Queso is enough to make me feel sick.

This recipe is a sodium/fat bomb. No one who cares about their health/longevity should eat this. Ok, I know "de gustibus non disputandum", but I have my limits.

We've gone straight to the source and confirmed that the amount of Salsa is correct.

I think the 1 TB salsa must be a typo - would someone please check?
