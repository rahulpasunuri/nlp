I'm only rating the topping. I use this on the overnight pizza dough also noted on this site. The combination of flavors really pop. It's a very adult flavor and a nice change. It's become my go to when I'm looking for comfort food.

This pizza was fantastic!!! The mushrooms turned out beautifully as did the onions. I made this for my three roommates who hate mushrooms and they gobbled it up. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

Amazing! Have made it several times, and each time it was flawless! Have tried it with whole wheat crust for a healthier version - still delicious!

This was amazing. I added pecorino cheese on top

Use a pizza stone and parchment paper. Preheat for an hour to get the stone good and hot. So tasty!

So Good! The biggest change we made was not following the directions of how to put it in the oven( because slowly sliding dough onto an already heated baking sheet sounded like a good way to get burned and drop the pizza,considering the size of our oven) Anyway, the crust turned out great anyway, although we did use a different dough(http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pizza-Dough-14646) Make this, it is REALLY REALLY good.

Incredible pizza! This was the first time I had made carmelized onions and was worried about them cooking so long. I thought they would burn onto the pan. I ended up cooking them about 40 minutes and they were perfect. The only change I made was I used EVOO because I didn't have the kinds called for. It turned out perfectly and I can't wait to use it again! The onions take awhile to cook but it gives you time to get everything else prepared so it really wasn't too time consuming. So delicious!

excellent - made 50/50 wheat / white crust didn't have the white wine and wound up mixing the mushrooms (only had cremini) and the onion mixture together when I ran out of space. Be wary of how much salt you put on top on the end.

This recipe offers beautiful inspiration. The changes I made to this recipe were not in the ingredients, but in the way that they were prepared before being added to the dough. I was unable to wrap my mind around adding nearly a stick of butter to my onions, so, I simply caramelized them the way I have been doing for years: a little olive oil and a pat of butter to start, then adding a touch more here and there as they cook. I did not add the grapeseed oil. I used only crimini mushrooms and the wine and rosemary took these petite morsels to such unbelievable heights. It was rich, yet bright at the same time. Constantly engaging. These flavors, with a creamy fontina and sweet onion base, ware perfectly balanced. Every single bit brought with it excitement and joy. I am excited to serve this with an even thinner crust cut into small pieces for an appetizer at a cocktail party. This is an exceptional pizza.

I made this with chanterelle mushrooms which I gathered from the forest floor near where we summer in Maine. This dish took me all afternoon to cook/bake, but it was for my carnivore uncle who is very skeptical about my vegetarianism, so I had to impress. The final result really shut him up! Everyone loved it, and I've never gotten grief from my family for being a vegetarian since.

Great pizza! I love caramelized onions so thought I'd give this a try. I bought refrigerated thin crust pizza dough and made one large pizza. I halved all the ingredients and it was perfect My husband is a meat lover so I added cooked, crumbled sweet Italian sausage and, although good, it sure doesn't need it. I used tarragon as suggested because I'm not a big rosemary fan. I think rosemary tends to overpower other flavors.

This recipe is delicious. Also try with fresh Tarragon instead of the Rosemary for a more subtle taste-- also perfect with the wine and mushrooms.

Never go out for gourmet pizza, or any kind of pizza again. This recipe rocks. Flavorful and delicious. We added some italian sausage and pepperoni too.

We make pizza every Friday, and this recipe is definietly our alltime favorite so far. We followed the recipe exactly, and the flavors are perfect together. The only downside is that it takes longer to prepare than our usual pizza recipes, but the results are well worth it. For the reviewer who had trouble grating the Fontina, put it in the freezer 30-60 minutes prior to grating.

This combination of flavors was fabulous. The fontina cheese is an absolute must- mozzarella would be a real disappointment. I made the recipe as directed but used EVOO instead of garlic oil (I didn't have any). This will be one of my standard pizzas for gourmet pizza night.

Really delicious recipe. Made into two large pizzas.

Fantastic! I used freshly picked chanterelles from the forests of Dzukija, Lithuania: once my wife and I picked them, I didn't really know what to do with them. As soon as I took a bite of this I was in awe. I didn't even make fresh dough; I was too tired, so I just used lavashes. Still fabulous.

OMG so yummy!! I love the flavour the white wine gave the mushrooms! Next time will use more cheese and shiitake mushrooms. Also, I left out the rosemary and used pre-mixed italian seasoning. Yum yum.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Cooked pretty much as described, with exception that I sauteed the shrooms in olive oil, cooked them longer before adding the wine, made 2 large pizzas instad of 6 small, and used white truffle oil instead of garlic oil. I didn't have a problem with it being too greasy as many other reviewers have stated.

This pizza was fabulous! I made it for a Boboli Cook-Off and adapted the ingredients for a 12" crust. I did put additional Fontina and Parmesean on top. Grating Fontina was like grating cream cheese. Anyone have any hints on how to make that easier?

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. The only thing I would do next time is to sprinkle a little extra fontina, goat cheese or parmesan on top of the mushrooms just to balance it out a bit.

This is by far the most delicious mouth watering pizza I have ever tried. Wolfgang Puck eat your heart out! Occasionally I like to mix in half wheat flour in the crust.

Delicious. The intense flavors that wine-braising and caramelizing give are all this pizza needs. It dresses up even a store-bought crust.

I've been using Epicurious for years but actually signed up just so that I could write a rave review for this recipe! I was at my friends' house and the kids were having a pizza party. I thought I would try this one, to have a nice adult option, but ended up having to fight the kids off!! My 2 godkids now ask me if we can make this almost every time I go visit! It does take some time to cook the onions and mushrooms down, but it is well worth it. WONDERFUL TASTE! And to get kids raving about mushrooms and onions...??? Gotta be good!

Rating: 4
Delicious and rewarding! I mixed the dough by hand because I don't have a processor and it turned out very well. I also substituted water for 1/2 the wine and the mushrooms retained the flavour of the wine regardless. The most important aspect was baking the pizzas on a stone, I believe. Mmmm so delicious.

I make this recipe over and over again and am asked for the recipe every time I serve it. I use my own crust recipe or if in a pinch, have even used a prepared crust. This is a keeper!

I'd like to give this two and a half forks for the way we made it. Loved the topping, which I cut in half to make one large pizza. Hubby made his standard dough (instead of the one that goes with this recipe) and I made the topping using reconstituted boletus edulis (porcini) mushrooms we'd picked and dried last year. Skipped the wine but added some of the mushroom water. Based on previous reviews, I used about half the oil and butter to cook the onions and that was perfect. Didn't have fontina so we used mozarella and a little feta cheese. I'd like to try the recipe as printed next time but it was good as it was.

I have made this several times now to rave reviews from friends and family. I love caramelized onions and agree with all reviewers, that you must cut down on the fat. They become sweet when cooked for so long and don't need the extra fat. I am going to try and make these as mini pizzas and serve as an hors'deuvre.

My changes: I tossed the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil, then roasted them on a cookie sheet under a foil tent (skipped the shallot and drank the wine.) I used shiitakes and criminis, which hold up well when tossed and roasted. I also caramelized the onions in olive oil instead of butter. I roasted a head of garlic while the mushrooms were roasting, then spread a few cloves over the pizza dough along with the minced rosemary. From there on, I followed the recipe. This pizza was easy and delicious, and presents nicely too.

I thought this recipe was incredible! I've made it several times and just realized I hadn't rated it. I have a very special dinner I'm making this coming weekend and I'd like to wow them with my meal, I thought this would be a great addition!

I caramelized the onions and roasted a head of garlic the night before. After being in the fridge, it was easy to get rid of some of the butter from the onions. Heated some olive oil w/ rosemary and some of the roasted garlic (use leftovers for dipping bread). Spread oil on the pizza crust and tossed a little w/ uncooked shiitakes. Topped pizza w/ caramelized onions, roasted garlic cloves, more rosemary, the mushrooms, parmesan, and some fresh cracked pepper goat cheese from the farmer's market. Overall, easier than the recipe - I generally don't pre-cook mushrooms for pizzas. I think the goat cheese was key - much better contrast with the sweet onions than fontina. Delicious!

Rating: 2
Flavor's good, but I agree with some of the other reviewers who said it's too greasy. Next time I'll make sure to drain the mushrooms well and pat off extra fat; and instead of using all fontina, I'll just add some fontina for flavor to part-skim mozzarella. By the way, fontina (and any other semi-soft cheese) is easier to grate if you throw it in the freezer for 30-40 minutes beforehand.

Finally a recipe that correctly states how long it takes to carmelize onions. Most recipes state under a half hour. Not so my fellow cooks. I did 3 large and 2 shallots and it actually took an hour. Well worth the effort, and there are leftovers to experiment with. Used some fabulous cheese recommended by the cheese guy. Satisfying. Go Steelers!

Made this without the fontina cheese for a pizza party the other day - it made the best pizza of the night! The mushroom combination was absolutely delicious and I will use just that aspect in future dishes. I used sage instead of rosemary and 50% button mushrooms, 30% oyster mushrooms and 20% shiitake. Might try some porcini next time as well. The caramelized onions were a bit too greasy so I'll cut down on the amount of oil next time. Really really good overall.

My husband and I did not like this pizza at all. We thought it was greasy. I tried it because we love another pizza recipe from your sight. If you liked this a little then I think you will really enjoy the Sausage, Red onion & Wild Mushroom pizza, march 2005. Also was a waste of 2 cups of a fourteen dollar bottle of wine. Would not make this again.

I used a whole wheat pizza dough recpie I always use but otherwise followed the recpie exactly. Liked the mix of flavors, although carmelized onions are good on just about anything. We thought the mushrooms needed something to hold them together better. I think next time I would put half the cheese on the bottom as instructed and sprinkle the other half on top.
