How do you soak 1/2 of a cup of something in only 1/4 a cup of something??? The bulgur was super crunchy despite following all the instructions to the letter. I even tried to save it by adding the oil after 45 minutes were up (as some comments suggested) and letting THAT sit to see if it could help. I only ended up with lemony oily crunchy sludge. I had to toss it and cook quinoa to use at the last minute. Flavors and everything were great so I'd use the basic idea again...but I don't understand how I messed up the bulgur part when everyone else seemed to think it was great. FRUSTRATION.

I used canned sardines instead of bulgur. The sardines made it too salty so I substituted maple syrup for the olive oil. Delicious!

First I had to go to whole foods to get the bulgar. Trader Joe's had none. Whole Foods didn't have fine..........only red bulgar. It still worked. I would use less bulgar(1/4 c and more parsley and mint. You could use what the recipe calls for in terms of the bulgar, but my choice is less. Make sure olive oil is fresh. Old olive oil makes it smell and taste awful. I ran out of the fresh organic Trader Joe's olive oil and had to use an older olive oil.(another brand).........not good. Recipe is lemony enough although I added 1 more tablespoon of fresh lemon. For ease of prepping: I put the parsley and mint in a mini cuisinart and let her go a few seconds..........easier than cutting everything. I would do this again for sure..........no need for as much bulgar. I used 1/2 onion in the cuisinart mini chopper instead of scallion. Maybe next time I will use shallots.

To make this gluten free I subbed the bulgur with cold cooked rice and added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to get the zing. I didn't have any scallions on hand so I use thinly sliced red onion. Delish! We'll be making this again for sure.

Instead of using bulgur, I used quinoa. The texture is great and it's loaded with protein. I left out the cinnamon, used vidalia onion instead of scallion and added garlic. Wonderful!

I wasn't overly impressed. I usually use some fresh garlic and red onions in my tabouli and I really missed them. The cinnamon gave me sort of a disappointing aftertaste. I really did like the lemon-soaked bulgar and and will keep that twist as I go back to my garlic/onion version.

It's been 45 minutes and the bulger is still crunchy. That's despite the fact that I added the tomatoes and salt at the same time as the lemon juice to create the greatest amount of tasty liquid. Perhaps my bulger wasn't as fine as the author wanted. Hot water to start is so dependable!

This was so good. I don't like the taste of the added cinnamon so next time i'll leave that out but overall it was delicious.

I've made this many times, and it is one of the best taboulis I have ever had. Serve it alongside hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves and middle eastern pita bread for a real feast.

This was good but way too lemony for me. I used fresh lemons so that might have been why. Good basic recipe, though, and easily altered for taste.

I made this to the recipe and it was delicious - very fresh and complimentary flavors.

Wonderful! Fresh and great as a side dish or as a main with a few boiled or grilled shrimp! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used dried mint as I did not have fresh and added cumin. A repeater for sure!

Delicious! Definitely add the cinnamon--it doesn't stand out at all in the recipe but adds a real depth of flavor. I subbed a very small amount of finely chopped onion rinsed in cold water for the scallions.

this recipe is great, especially if you like a lemony tabouli. for personal taste, i omit the cinnamon and mint and it is delicious. if doubling the recipe, i recommend reducing the amount of evoo.

I love this recipe and make it a couple times a month. It is really healthy and fresh and keeps well for several days. I don't add the cinnamon or the mint as I am not a fan. I also cut down on the oil. Makes a great side dish to chicken or lamb.

This was very yummy...a bit time consuming to chop all of the vegetables and herbs but well worth the time. I, like a previous reviewer, added cucumber instead of romaine, and it was wonderful. I served it with arctic char and asparagus and it was a wonderful hit. This will be a recurring recipe in my house.

I've been making bulgur in various forms for many years... Either as tabbouleh or in a similar Turkish methods but have never tried soaking it in lemon juice alone. I love this, it's tart and complex. This is a nice light salad. Very good.

I tripled this recipe for a larger crowd, used diced cucumbers instead of romaine, added slivers of 5 or so lemon balm leaves, and seeded the tomatoes. It turned out great and needed just a little salt and lemon juice at the end just before serving. The mint and cinnamon were really great in this dish.

This is a great recipe. I loved the cinnamon & mint. I tripled it for a larger crowd and added a large cucumber finely cubed and fine strips of 4 large lemon balm leaves. The recipe does not mention seeding the tomatoes, but I think this is a good idea. I tuned it up at the end, after it had been sitting in the fridge for a couple hours, with salt and a little more lemon.

I loved the extra lemon flavor in this recipe. I was skeptical that the bulgur would really be edible without boiling it, but after adding the oil and letting it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours, it was perfect. I never use mint when called for in recipes, but for some reason I decided to give it a try ... I was very glad I did. It added a freshness that wasn't overwhelmingly minty.

Having lived in Lebanon for 7 years I have acquired a taste for less bulgar and more mint. It should be a healthy green and red with accents of bulgar and no cinnimon. Soaking the bulgar in lemon juice and oil softens it and adds the flavor that will make people finish it in no time.

I made the recipe to the letter. Soaking the bulgur in lemon instead of water is far superior. I don't understand why some people omit the mint or cut down on parsley. As for those who use less olive oil, I believe they need to chop the parsley finer. I would add the spices to the bulgur itself before mixing in the other ingredients.

Simple and Delish! I added ½ a cucumber - finely diced, 2 Tbs olive oil (instead of 1/3 C) and 2 cloves garlic. I skipped the mint as were not fans. Made it on Saturday to go with Falafel and Hummus (both recipes on this site) for Monday dinner.

Delicious, and even better after several hours in the refrigerator. I use a bit more bulgur to make the parsley more palatable for tabouli newbies.

I've been eating tabouli, (or tabouleh), since I was two years old, and I must say that this recipe is pretty good. What I do is use more lemon juice and less olive oil, which makes it much lighter. The mint is essential, wonderfully refreshing. It's absolutely great as a leftover, because the juices are allowed to develop and soak into the bulgur a lot more, which is tastier and more satisfying than making it and then eating it all in one sitting. What a great dish!

I made this salad for folks who have no idea what tabouli is - and they loved it - kids too! It is really a fresh simple receipe.

This was good, not great. Better when freshly made rather than as leftovers. I followed the directions pretty much exactly as written. Maybe it's just my personal taste but after sitting in the fridge for a day, I didn't care for the mint taste or the way the tabouli soaked up the olive oil and became heavy. If I make it again, I will omit the mint and cinnamon, use less olive oil and finish it off in one sitting.

o.m.g. this is SO, unbelievably good. I did not soak the bulgur in lemon juice per the recipe but just with boiling water as on the package instructions, but still it was fantastic. It's kind of time consuming with all the chopping, but keeps in the fridge and is best cold.
