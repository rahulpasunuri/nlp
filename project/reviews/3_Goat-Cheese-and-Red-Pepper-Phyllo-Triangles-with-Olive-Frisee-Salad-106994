One of the best things I've made with phyllo dough. If I did it again, I'd tip the filling ratio in favor of the peppers.

The warm cheese over salad was good, but they were also nice cold as leftovers!

This makes a lovely 1st course salad. It's a nice combination of tastes and textures. I did not find it difficult to make at all. The phyllo sheets can be a pain to work with but I find keeping them covered with plastic wrap and a damp towel on top (not directly on the phyllo) works very well. Be sure to thaw the phyllo in the refrigerator before using.

We used to make these at our restaurant. Try substituting an herbed spinach and goat cheese filling.

Way to much work to put this together
