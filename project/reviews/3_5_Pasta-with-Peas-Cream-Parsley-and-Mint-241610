I used ditalini because I had it, which worked nicely - the peas and pasta are about the same size. I also added finely diced ham. I was out of heavy cream, so used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup pasta water. I added the peas to the pasta near the end, then stirred in all the other ingredients after straining. 1 pan, no muss, no fuss!

Yum! I subbed asiago for the parm and added some diced prosciutto for good measure. My 4 year old son loved it! Perfect with a chunk of crusty bread and a nice dry reisling. Will for sure be making this again :)

Just good, not great. I don't see the need to mix the cheese with the cream - I just stirred hot cream and peas into pasta to coat, then stirred in cheese and herbs, then a bit of pasta water - no clumping as others have mentioned. I felt it needed another flavor (maybe shallot?) to bring all the parts together.

This was a lovely, simple, light pasta. I used half-and-half, as always, and probably slightly more mint and parsley than called for (because I didn't measure). The main change I made--following others' complaints--was that I didn't add the cheese to the sauce in the pan. I just cooked the peas in the cream and let it reduce some, and then tossed everything together with the pasta. It's not like you need the fresh mint to cook... This solved the gloopy problem. And it didn't need the pasta water.

'tis true what they say about taste; it does develop over time. I've never been much on mint, but with it taking over the garden like it does, I've been trying to find ways to use more of it. Man-o-man and hot diggity dog; this is good eats! Both of us had seconds. The only change I made was using fresh peas rather than frozen as I had a bunch from said garden. I cooked them in the cream for about six minutes until al dente. Did I mention this is really good? I WILL be making this again!

Very easy to make and tasty. I was also surprised by how light it tasted. I will definitely make it again.

It was a very easy to make!! The sauce was too thick, so I added a cup of pasta cooking liquid to it. I also added ground chicken for the protein factor. Will definitely make this again!!

All I can say is turn the heat off AS SOON as the cheese has melted and not a moment later. I can only assume this would solve the problem of the entire thing seizing up and turning into a clumpy mess, because it was fine one second and nearly unsalvageable the next. We finished it, but I won't be making it again.

I really loved this recipe--as others are reporting, it was surprisingly light. I would have added more mint, but I love fresh mint. The sweetness of the herb and the sweetness of the peas went really well together. If you're looking for another recipe to try that combines pasta and mint, check out this one with mint, peas, and pistachios--surprisingly amazing: http://whitebison.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/ricotta-ravioli-with-pistachios-peas-mint-and-parmesan/

This recipe is comforting and satisfying as written. The second time making this, I used 1 1/2 tablespoons dried mint, did not add pasta water to the sauce, but used 2 cups of the cream and waited until the last moment to toss in the cheese, which dispersed the cheese more evenly within the dish. Lovely and fresh tasting.

I absolutely love this dish! Ingredients can be found at any grocery store, preparation is quick and easy and the final product is always a crowd pleaser. I substitute fresh basil for the mint and, as other reviewers suggested, add freshly squeezed lemon juice to the pasta before serving. Delicious!!

I used non-fat 1/2 and 1/2, and it was a clumpy mess. The milk never thickened, and the cheese was in big globs. The flavor was very good though. Was this because of the non-fat substitution?

This recipe would be much better if the pasta and peas were halved and the rest of the sauce left at the same proportions. I could barely taste the fresh herbs and Parmesan cheese--the taste of the peas overwhelmed. If I were to make it again, I would add more herbs to the mix.

I LOVEEE this recipe! its so simple and easy, and it tastes soo good! ive made it serveral times and its a big hit. i dont use the mint and i dont always use fresh parsley. i sometimes add prosciutto which tastes great. i have also used half and half and it works just as good as whipping cream. also good with tortolini

This was really good... I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used basil instead of mint and added lemon juice like previous reveiwers suggested and it was perfect... I usually hate heavier cream sauces, too, but this one was great.

This recipe could feed an army! My girlfriend and I barely put a dent in it. Next time I'd add another flavor to it - I think it would be good with prosciutto.

Ewwww! Sorry, but... I thought this was yucky. I followed the directions to the letter, and it was still way too salty, too clumpy, too grainy. Might have been okay the second it was poured on the hot pasta, but as it cooled, ewww. Maybe I'm just not that into Parmesan cheese.

We love it. Half the time we make it exactly as is. Or, for a fun change and an elegant company meal, we've also made it with asparagus and basil rather than peas and mint.

This was surprising light and refreshing for a cream based sauce. I did use only a cup of cream, and more of the pasta water than the recipe called for so that it wasn't so creamy. Really good!

This is soo good and soo easy to make! I used fresh sugar snap peas instead of frozen peas and topped each dish with some toasted pine nuts. The fresh mint really makes the dish. Enjoy!

Our whole family, right down to the 1-year-old, loved this! We had fresh peas and mint from the garden - a great flavor combo. I followed the recipe more or less as written, except didn't use quite as much cheese as it called for. Also added a ladleful of pasta water to loosen the sauce. It was quick, easy, and pretty. I could see the addition of bacon or pancetta for extra flavor, but it was really yummy just as is!

Great summer recipe. A great weeknight meal. The flavors blend perfectly and the mint really brightens up the dish without being over powering. Love it and will make it all summer.

Good, but not amazing. Definitely easy and quick to make. Sauce comes out too dry - maybe less cheese and more liquid would help. I added about 2 cups of water and it was still dry.

This was wonderful and would definitely make it again. I used goat milk with a little flour to thicken and pecorino romano and it was just fine. Also used asparagus tips instead of peas and took someone elses note of the lemon juice. Quick and easy, loved it.

This was wonderful!!! However I don't eat dairy from a cow, so I used goat milke and pecorino romano and it worked out just fine, just a little flour as a thickener. Used asparagus tips instead of peas and added a splash of lemon juice. Its definitely a keeper and the mint adds a unique refreshing flavor.

A nice spring dish with a twist. Made exactly as the recipe calls for and turned out just right.

I thought this dish had a really fresh taste. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. The peas and mint were very complimentary. We ate this as a main dish but would make a great side, maybe with lamb chops?

I took previous reviewers advice & subbed basil for the mint--a big hit! I'll make it again, hopefully in the summer with some fresh peas.

What a great combination of flavors (and we were a little uncertain how that mint would be!). I used a splash of white wine instead of cooking liquid and subbed pecorino romano for the parm. Sooo delicious and tasty!

Super easy to make and it heated up well for leftovers. Next time I make this I would surely leave out the mint. I didn't care for that flavor

This is a great dish. The secret is to treat it like an alfredo, wisk in the chesse to the cream and once that is smooth then mix in the mint and peas. The peas being frozen really keeps them crisp. The dish is like a spring day, bright and crisp.

this did not come out well.. like other reviewer's experiences, my cheese all clumped together. the tastes were good, but it looked terrible. i made it exactly by the recipe, too.. shame!

This was one of the tastiest and easiest meals that we have enjoyed in a long time. While we ate the dish as our main meal, it was light enough that it could be turned into a side dish with some grilled fish or chicken.

good, not the greatest flavor. Had the same problem with the cheese and tried to make it more healthy by using nonfat half and half. Sauce came out watery. Think I'll try another recipe

I love pasta with peas, and I've recently become a vegetarian, so finding a recipe that didn't call for bacon or pancetta was a life saver. I also love mint. I made the same mistake as one of the previous reviewers, and accidentally bought shredded parmesan instead of grated... and just like her, I ended up with a big, rubbery ball of cheese in my sauce that never melted into the rest of it. It still tasted great though. I'm looking forward to making it again, this time with the right kind of parmesan, and seeing what it's SUPPOSED to look like!

Nice dish. The mint gives it a lovely fresh aroma that is unique. Really liked it, would add more parmigiano, salt and pepper in the end to give it additional contrast. Very good and quick to make.

Made this last night with fresh shredded parmesean instead of fresh grated parmesean and ended up with a lumpy, cheesy mess. It still tasted good, but the sauce was not beautiful. Delicate flavor of peas, parsley and mint could be even further enhanced with pancetta.

This pasta was very good, although i am not a big fan of mint in pasta. i think i would try it again, (but use a little less mint or use basil insted)

Excellent, easy, and ready in minutes. Feel free to swap fresh basil for the mint - although either is wonderful. A squirt of fresh lemon brightens the dish, too. This is one of those recipes where its beauty is in its simplicity. Easy to adapt with other pasta shapes, too.

Really yummy. I made it (1/4 recipe) my v- day dinner. It came together fast and didn't dirty many pots and pans. It would be great for a dinner party, especially if you measured out and prepped ingredients ahead.

This is a great, fast dinner. It is minty so make sure you like mint or use a little less if you aren't the biggest fan. Very pretty too.
