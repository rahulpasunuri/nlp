Looking for a change from my usual Orange-Spice Pumpkin Pie I tried this one for the holidays.Everyone enjoyed it but for me it runs second. The "Perfect Pumpkin Pie" base needs some adjustment in my book.

Decided to skip the pecan pie this Thanksgiving and stick with a twist on a classic. Boy was I glad I did. This pie turned out perfectly. I was distraught over not finding the correct cookies for the topping but settled on a chinese almond cookie. Though I'm sure the authentic Italian cookies would be better, we were happy with the outcome. Oh, and I had so much going on Thanksgiving day that I forgot to bake the topping with the pie so I had to add it after the pie was cooked and put it in the oven for a few minutes to crisp it up. Worked for us.

Loved, LOVED this recipe. Pumpkin pie has never done much for me with its mushy texture. The cookies give it the right amount of crunch to contrast the smoothness of the pumpkin and the amaretto adds a nice flavor note. Everyone at the Thanksgiving table wanted seconds. Big yum.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and I must say it was a huge hit! I brought it over to my mother's house, and she went crazy for it... and she HATES pumpkin pie! I did modify the recipe slightly... I didn't do the topping and I added more amaretto. Best pumpkin pie I've ever had - I'll be making it for Christmas again...

This is a fantastic recipe - I thought pumpkin pie was great before, but now it's even better!

Very good variation of the classic (and face it, boring) pumpkin pie. I fully agree with the most recent reviewer. The negative review was the equivalent of the 6-year-old's "blech!" Please don't bother.

Sorry, I really haven't made this... however, even if I disliked it... as the previous post. My good manners would dictate a mature response. Such as: Sorry this is not something I would try again.... There is never a need to be so discourteus.. or nefarious.

Best pumpkin pie ever and I'm hesitant to add additional ingredients to classic recipes--but how could you go wrong with Amaretto!!!
