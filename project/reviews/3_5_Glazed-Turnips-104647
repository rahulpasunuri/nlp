Delicious. It came out perfectly. We were looking for a new way to eat all the root veggies from our CSA, and this was a winner.

This recipe is delicious. I used chicken broth instead of water.

A fine way to eat turnips -- I can only imagine that the people who found their turnips turned into mush cut them too small. I substituted scallions for parsley and threw them in during the glazing period. Looked and tasted great.

This recipe was awful. I'm not sure where we went wrong (we followed the recipe exactly), but we ended up with a yellow-colored mush instead of glazed solid pieces.

Tried this recipe a couple of nights ago and it was fantastic. I found that 1/2 teaspoon of sugar was enough for me. Fantastic recipe and a definite for the Xmas table this year.

Sigh...I wanted so much to enjoy this recipe. The sweetness with the turnips was not a combination that I cared for. I did take an earlier reviewers suggestion and used honey instead of sugar. Maybe at some point I will try this recipe again using sugar.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner last year and it was a hit.

Very simple to prepare, and the results were quite tasty! This was my first time preparing turnips (but not my first time eating them!) and was extremely pleased with the results I had with this recipe.

Just served this to the Mister and his buddy alongside a basic lemon rosemary baked chicken breast and steamed broccoli. Not only zero whimpers about lack of a starch side, they RAVED, and it's been requested as a T-giving side! This is DEFinitely going into the rotation.

Try making this one with beets instead of turnips - it really enhances their natural sweetness. I also like to replace the sugar with honey.

I sought out a simple receipe because I had a craving for turnips. Strange? Not really. Turnips, to me, are a cross between a radish and a potato, so I thought what a great flavor they'll have. This recipe was fantastic, and had wonderful flavor! NOTE: My turnips boiled faster and became soft quickly, next time I'll try reducing the amount of water to 1 cup to see if that helps (though, honestly, we loved the slightly mashed consistency of them being slightly over done). Also, I didn't have fresh parsley, so I tossed in some DRIED CHIVES while in the glazing stage. Both my husband and I loved the dish and will make it again and again. A new favorite for us and nice alternative to potatoes!!!

We received turnips in our first delivery from our share in an organic farm. I had never done much with turnips before, so I went online to find a recipe. This was easy to prepare and turned out to be very tasty. I'll probably make it again next week if more turnips appear!

Having never made turnips before, this seemed like an easy and well-reviewed first foray. I wasn't disappointed. I served this dish at a dinner party where all my guests and I were a little nervous about eating turnips. We each took 1-2 bites when the dish was first passed around - and then all of us said, "OH! Hey, these aren't bad!" Very easy, very tasty, and definitely will be made again.

I'd have given this 2.5 forks if I could have. I thought it was very good, and easy. A good week night side dish, and a good way to enjoy turnips!

Wow! I didn't expect such a simple dish to taste so great. I halved the butter and salt to make it healthier, and it was still delicious. I also forgot to add in the salt so I sprinkled it on at the end, which was probably more effective anyway. Definitely a recipe to make again!

I'd never prepared turnips before but this was very tasty to me. However, my husband and 3 year old WEREN'T impressed by any means. The turnips still had the very distinctive "turnip taste" that I liked, but non veggie eaters probably wouldn't care for it. So all in all, I'd make it again for me, but this dish isn't for everyone.

This recipe was a big hit at my dinner table, my husband and son didn't like turnips until I fixed this recipe. They both enjoyed it, the one problem was that I don't fix enough. So tonight I will fix enough to go around for seconds.

I had never cooked with turnips before, and figured this looked simple enough to try. I decided that I'd add a bit of brandy at the end, and it was absolutely wonderful. Try the brandy addition, and you'll suddenly want turnips every week.
