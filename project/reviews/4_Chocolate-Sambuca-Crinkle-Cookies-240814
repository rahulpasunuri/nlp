These did not come out as I expected, at all. I expected the balls to flatten and they didn't. Flavor was good, and I like sambuca, but I don't think the alcohol burned of completely. I wonder what I did wrong.

Made half batch and followed the recipe exactly. Made 12 cookies and baked for 10 minutes. Yum. They won't last long.

I made a half batch to test for a cookie exchange and I wasn't that impressed. Neither my husband or I liked them enough to ever make again. The texture was a bit rough and dense. The flavor wasn't overpowering but it didn't make it amazing. It just tasted like dense chocolate cookies with some licorice flavor.

If you don't want to endure the chilling time required to form cookies, this recipe makes great brownies. Prepare batter exactly as directed (I used toasted pecans, finely chopped, in lieu of walnuts)pour into 9x9 square pan, lined w/ foil & lubed. Bake for 30-35 mins (convection oven at high altitude, adjust accordingly) Apply generous dusting of conf. sugar atop cooled brownies. Great texture & flavor.

Great grown-up cookie, very rich chocolate flavor but felt kind of light, strangely. I used 3 TBs of whiskey instead of Sambuca (it's what I had on hand) and thought great, but definitely had a more of an alcoholic kick to it. A hit at the office Xmas party.

These cookies had a delicious aroma and flavor. I used a small ice cream scoop (about 15 ml) to portion, and discovered the dough needs to be pressed down otherwise the dough does not spread much and stays in a ball shape. I made 3 batches, varying the amount of icing sugar on the surface--the best result was just a medium amount on the cookie surface, not covering every spot. Too much sugar resulted in a harder crust, with the excess sugar in the cracks absorbing moisture from the air and getting soggy. Too little icing sugar on the surface makes the cookie look moldy. Preparing the dough overnight saves time.

Very nice cookie. The dark chocolate and the hint of anise went really well together and they were one of the prettiest cookies I've baked in a long time. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. A delicious chocolatey treat with great texture and flavor!

I made these with Creme De Mint liquor and they were FANTASTIC! I used the convection setting at 325 for 12 minutes and they came out perfect. I also made sure my Baking Powder was fresh and they cookies rose as expected. Definitely a keeper!

I used black sambuca and think it might have been too strong. Next time I'm going to make these with creme de menthe. Mixed the dough the night before and refrigerated... so forming them into balls the next morning was very easy and quick.

These really are as good as the rating that they're given. A really amazing flavor... just the right amount of chocolate without it being heavy. A crispy outside with a soft cake-like to brownie -like consistency in the middle. These really are WOW!

My husband declared this the best dessert I've ever made. Use good quality chocolate (I used Sharffen Berger.)

I have saved stacks of old cooking magazines in my basement for years in hopes of finding this recipe. Countless times I've searched "cookie, chocolate & sambuca". Today is my lucky day - these are the best! They are unusual, beautiful & delicious.

These are FABULOUS! I make them without nuts as they make a prettier cookie. They are especially attractive when arranged on an elegant platter or cake plate. A perfect cookie and presentation for holiday parties. Enjoy! =)

Delightful: tasty and a nice variation on the chocolate cookie. I have to admit that my first batch of baked cookies was only nominal. I was satisfied with them, but when I cooked a second batch the next day (after the dough had gotten firm in the refrigerator overnight), the result was much improved. The first bake was with dough that had been in the refridge for 2 hours but was not firm; the cookies were only in for 10 minutes but they were slightly stiff. The cold batch let me roll the dough into balls, let them keep their shape better in the oven and didn't let them cook as much as the first batch so the insides were light. I'd say the cookies are best hot and served with a glass of milk.

I substituted kahlua for sambuca and brown sugar for white sugar. It's very easy to overbake these and turn them into hockey pucks. First round was too hard. Second batch was great. Love the cracked crinkly look and the insides remained soft and tasty. Could be interesting to make a blond version.

I left the dough in the fridge for a few hours and had to let it sit out for at least 30 minutes . . . it was very stiff and hard to work. Loved the taste and will make again next year.

This is my favorite Christmas cookie and very popular with friends and family!

Maybe someone can tell me what I did wrong. Mine never spread that much, but mostly stayed a ball with only a few cracking. I didn't want to bake longer because I worried about them overbaking and drying out and being to hard. Also, the powdered sugar didn't stay white, but turned an ugly tan color, so I dusted them afterwards just to make them prettier. I hate making cookies but this looked so easy, but my hatred will remain.

I am so happy to have this recipe again. I have been looking for it since 1999 when you last published it. They are fabulous!

I made these last year for gifts for my parents and some other friends and everyone absolutely LOVED them! I've gotten several requests to make them again!
