This souffle came out perfect! I used a 1.75 qt dish and skipped the collar, pre-heated the oven to 425 degrees before putting the dish in, then reduced to the baking temperature. Also, I didn't find it necessary to transfer milk/yolk mixture to a new pan (saves on dishwashing!). It was delicious, light, puffy, and impressive looking.

Delicious and very easy to make, but with one major flaw: after 50 minutes, it was still majorly undercooked! Trust the "firm and set in center" more than the time, and allow excess time to let it finish. And no, I didn't refrigerate it first, it was made fresh. As other reviewers have said , there was no need for the collar; it puffed beautifully, but was nowhere near requiring the extra support.

I just made the souffle. It's bittersweet for sure, very dark chocolatey and not terribly sweet. You don't need the ladder and I think it's important to sweeten the whip cream. It wasn't real easy to make and I think it would be too much for a dinner party. I'd rather serve something I could make in advance. I liked this recipe but wasn't crazy about it. I don't think I'll make it again, but that doesn't mean it was a bad recipe. Others might think this is great. Worth a try.

I made this for Mother's day with the "help" of the 3 kids. It was easy, understandable and turned out FABULOUS! Baking in a convection oven, decreasing to 350F and also here at 5400 feet, it helped to tweak a bit. The butter and sugar in the ramekin form a "ladder" which makes the collar unnecessary to acheive a glorious rise. We used Giradelli and it was very rich and smooth!

Made mods for a dinner party. Preheat 350. No flour. Beat 8 yolks with 8oz melted chocolate. Fold 8 sweetened (1 cup sugar) whites into chocolate by thirds. Line baking sheet (raised sides) with parchment. Carefully spread souffle over parchment and bake about 25 minutes. Cool. Carefully tap out souffle over large sheet of plastic wrap. Whip sweetened, brandied heavy cream (2T brandy, or coffee liqueur, or other liqueur plus 1T sugar with 1 1/2 cups cream) over entire souffle. Use plastic to roll souffle over cream in a spiral shape. Coat with chocolate ganash. Serve chilled with fresh strawberries. Drizzle berries with extra ganash. VERY easy and excellent. Serves 8-10 easily but use same day.

This souffle turned out perfect. Big and fluffy, oh so good. I didn't add the paper border, not needed. Just wipe the edge of the ramekin with your thumb and it rises equal. Will make this classic, over and over again.

My daugher, a confirmed chocoholic, begged for this as a birthday cake. The looks on the faces of six 11 year-olds was worth the apprehension of a first-time souffle maker. Recipe was flawless, souffle delicious and cooked to perfection. All this in spite of souffle jitters and an iffy gas oven.

It was really good, except for the part where it said to butter and sugar the souffle dish, then line the butterede and sugared dish with foil or wax paper...it seemed like a waste of time and a waste of sugar, but the overall souffle was delicious!

This was my first souffle experience ever! It turned out just beautifully, but I think next time I make it I won't bother with the collar, since when it came time to pull it off, the whole souffle collapsed. The flavor was great, I served it will coffee gelato and lightly whipped cream for people to choose between. Raves all around.

as far as souffles go, this one is delicious. the complexity of the chocolate really comes out -- it's not drowned in sweetness like so many dishes. my favorite way to serve: with de-seeded rasberry sauce and espresso whipped cream. a tip if you're new to souffles: preheat the oven to 400 or 425. put the souffle in, bake for 5 minutes, then turn down the heat to 375. this helps the souffle get an initial puff, and also helps form a little more of a crust. and copper bowls really do make a difference when you beat egg whites!

This was my first soufflé. Hmm. Be sure to fold it in enough - mine was still splotchy with bits of white. I wouldn't have needed the foil. After all that hassle, too! It sunk right away and was sort of goopy. Never the less, it tasted good, and it was probably my fault more than any reflection on the recipe. It was fun, and my parents still liked it. Experience soufflérs, I'd say go for it! People like me, find something a bit easier with which to start.

This souffle did not cook completely in the center for me, leaving a wet mess in the middle. Leaving it in the oven longer would have badly burned the top, which was already a bit singed to begin with. It still tasted good and looked good before it was cut, though.

A great first souffle. To put a little spin on the recipe I infused the milk with earl grey tea. I brought the milk to a gentle boil, added two earl grey tea bags, and then allowed the milk tea to cool for about an hour or so before adding it to the recipe. The tea adds a beautiful and delicate touch to this dessert.

As this souffle emerges from the oven, it is exquisite. Seeing it shrink was a disappointment, as my guests never saw it in fully risen glory. My guests seemed to like this better than I. My preference is for a heavier, more obvious chocolate taste. The chocolate taste here to a back seat to the light texture of the souffle. Not an quick dessert to make - the buttering, sugaring and wrapping the foil was awkward for this souffle novice, though it turned out fine and was not difficult. Overall, an elegant and light (ish) chocolate dessert.

I made this for guests New Years Eve and served with Creme Anglaise. I found it very easy to make. It was a big hit, my guests were impressed with it and with me, wish I had made more.

Very easy. No scorching problems at all, but I watched the chocolate constantly while melting. I'd make it again. My family loved it.
