This is a really good potato salad. It's got a little tang and a little kick. Use low fat mayo and it's pretty healthy as well. Will make again.

I've been making this Potato Salad since it first came out in Bon Appetit. I've always had rave reviews. Since it is spring and my chives are ready to be used, thought I would dig it out and make it again. I agree with the reviewer who indicated there were too many peas.

This is absolutely the best potato salad I have ever had. I make it for every BBQ or event, and I always get compliments on how amazing it is. It is the perfect combination of ingredients and the crunch from the celery is excellent. The only thing I change in this recipe is that I use less peas than the recipe calls for because there are just too many with 1 1/2 cups. This is HIGHLY recommended.

I absolutely love this salad - I followed the recipe exactly and have made it several times - I just love the flavor - I use fresh chopped dill in the end - I love dill with any kind of potato dish. I am about to make it once again and since I had to refer to the recipe I thought I would give a review which I never do. I love it!! I did not give it 4 forks because I thought really it was a 3 but still love it.

The vinegar added to the warm potatoes gives this potato salad just the right amount of acid which balances the fat from the mayonnaise. The garlic, chives, and cayenne pepper add spice to the dish while the peas and celery add crunch. This has now replace a family favorite recipe in our house as the new favorite.

Rating: 3
Very good. I wasn't expecting to see cayenne on the ingredient list, but ultimately, I'm happy I did. Great with fish, I served mine with pan-seared salmon with salt and pepper. (Just remember, it's much, much better fully chilled. Make sure to allow enough time for cooling.)

I've been looking for a good savory potato salad. This certainly is! I used fresh peas, and the sweetness was a lovely contrast to the garlic & chives combination.

Rating: 4
Darn good! I ran out of white wine vinegar so I used plain vinegar instead, just cutting it by 1/2 tbsp since it's stronger. I was surprised by the idea of adding cayenne, but it worked really well. I also used light mayo (Hellman's). Since I had heavy-meat-eaters for lunch, I poached some chicken breasts in provencal herbs and chilled and cubed them to add to the salad. A really great dish--the chived just made it.

Reading these reviews makes me want to go kick in the front of my television. "Double the garlic." *whine* "Add some bacon." *pout* "I've been making this from memory for the past 40 years." - (Oh, careful you don't slice your juggler with that Faberware Chef's knife as you pat yourself on the back!). As Thomas Keller says, "It's easy to cook a filet mignon, or saute a piece of trout, serve it with browned butter a la meuniere, and call yourself a chef." I'm entertained at how doubling the garlic or loading pork fat in the dish, (like a certain television host does to the amazement of the crowd) is of such concern when we just want to know if you liked the recipe or not. This is a very well balanced recipe - both to the palette and to the eye. Anyone pretentious enough to turn their nose up at this recipe can go back to the grocery store and buy a bottle of Emeril's potato salad seasoning and throw the balance of this recipe off with too much garlic. - BAM!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I've made many a potato salad but I thought this one was better, by far, than any others I've made. I only used 2 celery stalks and I diced them quite small. I also put in less cayenne than called for just because I was serving it to someone who doesn't like spicy food. Everyone who tasted this loved it. This is definitely going into my "keepers"!

I love this recipe. Although, I have made a couple of changes to it. In place of the celery, chopped green beans par-boiled. I also added more garlic and vinegar. Everyone who had it the way that I made it from the magazine the first time agreed that with those changes, it was even more delectible.

For the rest of the universe, this is probably a 3-fork dish. However, I make absolutely horrible potato salad, and keep trying different recipes to find one that is a keeper. This is it. None of us finished the main course because we kept taking more and more of this salad. Loved it just as is, didn't need free-range anything or great-grandma's old world nothing.

Folks, I'm surprised that so many cooks are looking up -- and reviewing -- such a banal recipe as that for a potato salad, something I thought we could all dream up with our eyes closed. I'm guilty myself, obviously, although I've been making my German mother's version - sans recipe - for 20 years. The trick to any good potato salad is saturating the potatoes with vinegar while they're warm (use a much more liberal dose than this recipe calls for), as one reviewer noted. A good German cook does this two days before even deigning to serve the salad, allowing the vinegar and salt and pepper to fully penetrate the potatoes. The only other things I'd alter in this recipe are, yes, stepping up the garlic and chopping the celery very fine. Use petite frozen peas (if you haven't got fresh), too. And, naturally, it would be better if you made fresh aioli from scratch, with organic/free range eggs! This really is good, just trust your judgment - no one really needs a recipe for potato salad!

Rating: 2
This was definitely edible, and I may make it again, though I think that the suggestions left by other reviewers to "double the garlic" are meant ironically. I used exactly the amount called for, and I was not alone in thinking that it was a bit much. If you cannot get enough garlic, use the recommended dosage; if you are a close-talker, halve it.

Excellent potato salad, took it to a luncheon and 6 people wanted the recipe. I left out the peas and added red onion, also doubled the garlic.

Very light and tasty salad, with or without the bacon. My question, if you don't like peas, why put them in? Or why make this salad? I didn't even notice the peas, and I'm not a pea fan either. Will make again.

Lucky to have an abundance of fresh peas this season found this recipe showcases them well. My husband and I both loved it. I wouldn't chance anything except to maybe try it with roasted garlic for a smoother garlic flavor. The chive flowers out of my garden made a really nice garnish.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous recipe! The flavor is wonderful and it looks great, too. The peas and celery give it a marvelous crunch (and I'm not a big celery fan). I made it a few hours ahead so that the flavors would have a chance to "meld". I used White Balsamic vinegar--The first time I have tried it--and increased the seasoning amounts a little. What a super way to dress up anything barbequed. I'll definately make this again!

Wow, this is an amazing salad. I didn't have any white wine vinegar so substituted 2 T. of tarragon vinegar and 1 T. of dry white wine. Also was lacking peas so I added some sliced black olives. I peel my potatoes and just leave a bit of skin on. Next time I might add 3/4 c. peas and 3/4 c. corn.

I had this at a party last weekend and it was very good. The salad was finished by the end of the meal with good reviews from some of the partygoers. However, it lacked the garlicky kick I would have expected from an aioli base. The peas added a nice touch and flavor to the potato salad.

I have made this dish a dozen times. In fact, I have made it for dinner to go with the ribs we smoked for tonight. The combination of garlic and fresh chives spiced with the red pepper makes a potato salad my family and friends love.

I finally made this dish after reading all the pro's and con's and have to say that I sit somewhere in the middle re. the recipe.A friend whose opinion I very much value loved the recipe, so I went ahead and made it, but though I doubled the garlic, I can't say that the potato salad really packed much of a punch. Seems like it's the kind of recipe that you hve to fool with so much, that I'm not sure how to rate it. It's more like the starting point of a recipe that could be good if it were changed radically.So, all in all, I found it to be somewhat disappointing. The people at our party seemed to like it, but I wasn't terribly impressed.

I made this for some guests, and the reviews were so-so. My mother makes a much better red potato salad with dill and yogurt. I will continue to use that recipe instead. This one was just not very exciting. By the way, I also made the tomato green bean salad from the same issue, and it received RAVE reviews (you have to use HALF the dressing for it though).

I do a lot of cooking, and can usually tell if I'll like a dish just by reading the recipe. Well, last week I made the Green Bean and Grape Tomato Salad recipe on this site, expecting to love it, and ended up hating it. This recipe looked horrible, but with my taste buds in a slide, I thought I'd give it a try. What a wonderfull surprise. It was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe pretty closely, steaming the potato quarters, then giving them a big dosing of vinegar, salt and pepper, and then using maybe 3/4C of mayo in the dressing. The sweetness of the peas are a terrific complement to the blandness of the potatoes. Next time I might add a bit of sliced red onion. I don't like bacon in my potato salad, as other reviewers suggested, as I find it gets touch when cold. My only problem with this recipe is the author calling a Hellman's mayonaise with garlic and chives a "traditional french aioli."

Great potato salad. Though I'm not a fan of mayonnaise-based potato salads, I thought this one was terrific. As suggested, I added another (small) clove of garlic, and a touch more cayenne-- otherwise no changes. I halved the amount of potatoes, and kept half the aioli for another use. I think it would be delicious on burgers, or a BLT.

We absolutely loved this potato salad. However, I did follow the suggestions of others and kicked it up. I doubled the amount of mustard, chives, garlic, and cayenne pepper. Yum! Oh, I also quartered the potatoes before boiling, and they came out great - no big hard potatoes.

I used very fresh garlic, and it was very garlicky, so I'll probably tone it down next time I use it on potato salad. I also used fat-free mayonnaise and no one could tell. I think the aioli on its own is a neat twist on the original for dipping veggies, shrimp, and as a sauce for fresh crabcakes (my next mission).

I'm not generally a big fan of peas, but they were a perfect complement to the potatoes in this salad. I took the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and added bacon pieces to the salad, and it made the already great salad just incredible.

First off Pea or Pooh? That is the million dollar you dont know Jack Question. As for this recipe, one fork is way too much. I give it a spork. Not quite spoonworthy or forkworthy. And who wants peas in potatos. The Potatohead family of Redwood City would go culinary over such blatant disregard for potato fans. Peas? I ask you again, Peas? I say omit the peas and add some grand flank steak and a shot of whiskey. toodles

I'll bet the people who found it bland either used too many potatoes or didn't notice the "Season generously with salt and pepper." instruction. I did use extra garlic and pulverized it with kosher salt before blending dressing. Without changing anything else, I found it quite a delightful salad.

I enjoyed this recipe as it was a more sophisticated version of a potato salad. I added a little more vinegar and cayenne for additional tang, did substitute tofu mayonnaise, and lightly sautéed the garlic (as I do for almost every recipe that calls for raw garlic) so I wouldn't taste this for the rest of the day.

I have made this salad twice, and each time enjoyed it thoroughly. It's simple to make; it's different from the usual potato salad; and, most importantly, it tastes great. I have to disagree with those reviewers who say the salad is bland or needs additional seasoning. Sometimes you can over-complicate a recipe to the point you really cannot savor the principal ingredients. This is a chive aioli potato and pea salad -- each of these four ingredients "speaks out" in this recipe, meaning that you can taste the potatoes, the peas, the chives and the garlic. If you can make the salad well in advance of serving, the chives, in particular, have a chance to assert themselves. I did cook my peas, cooled them in cold water, and drained and dried them before putting them in the salad.

I make a similar salad (my non-potato salad eating husband requests it!) I cube redskin potatoes, and boil, then rinse in cold. Add frozen peas and corn (fresh will be great when available). I dress with mayo, combined with chopped garlic and an assortment of chopped herbs (whatever strikes me as good in the garden that day). I don't measure, but it's probably a cup of mayo with 2-3 large garlic cloves and 1/4 cup or so of herbs, chopped. Salt and pepper to taste.

haven't made this recipe, but have made similar ones. If it was too bland, here is a suggestion: roughly chop the potatoes and add the vinegar, salt, papper, garlic while still HOT. The flavors penetrate better. Another note: recently I cooked potatoes for salad in the microwave (on a plate, covered with a vented top). Lots easier, and no water to steam off.

I thought this recipe was great! I didn't change a thing- made it for 4th of july and everyone loved it, even the more traditional family members who normally don't "put peas in potato salad." frankly, i didnt view this as a potato salad- so much better, it is.

The key is aioli. Using regular mayo just doesn't cut it. Making homemade aioli is worth the effort. That's where the "zing" is.

I haven't actually made this recipe, but I have made one similar to it. The recipe reads like it might taste a bit bland, but if you want to add some spice to it use season salt instead of regular salt and for those who want more zing and aren't vegetarians, try adding some diced grilled garlic sausages(or your favorite spicy sausage). You'll have a hard time not eating more!

I made this potato salad for the 4th because I thought the addition of the peas would make it sweet and "pretty," the dressing would provide the flavor and it was a little different than the usual. I liked the look of the finished recipe, but I thought it needed more zing--more flavoring. I would make it again, but I would doctor it up a bit.

I've made this salad twice now. The first time I loved it, the second time I found it quite boring. I followed the recipe both times. I think the salad needs more spice (pepper/hot pepper sauce/celery seed or salt/garlic/chopped bacon). Something! I'll try it again because it is pretty, but I'll have to experiment with different ingredients.
