I really liked these latkes, but the latke base (the shredded ingredients) itself wasn't amazing - it was the creme fraiche and lox that made it "wow".

These were very good, but nothing exceptional. You can't really taste the apples or celeriac, which was disappointing because I wanted something a little different than an ordinary potato pancake. I served them with applesauce and the sour cream/horseradish sauce (no salmon). They're better right out of the oven; they become greasy after sitting for a bit and being reheated.

Excellent recipe. I skipped the celeriac (expensive, obscure ingredient in my area) and the garnishes, and they were still delicious. A fun food!

What a fabulous recipe. Topped with 1/2 tsp of salmon caviar made it even more special. Served with a crisp white wine and an all green salad with lemon/olive oil dressing.

Wow!! I had a cooked unpeeled russet and used it without the squeeze technique. It made it really fast and easier. My husband loved it and so did I. I think all the ingredients-apple, celeriac, marjoram really compliment one another. I can hardly wait to have leftovers again.

Sorry - that's a 250 degree oven, not 350!

Made this as a first course for a small New Years Eve dinner party. It was excellent. Ommitted the celery root (it is a small amount). Becaus eI didn't want to be frying in my nice clothes while guests were here, I cooked up the pancakes about an hour ahead of scheduled, dried them very well on papertowels and put them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet in a 350 degree over instead of the recommended 325. Worked perfectly. Served with a rose champagne that went very well. Might even put a small spoonful of osetra caviar or the like next time.

Everyone loved these! I used some additional onion because we like our potato pancakes w/lots of onion but otherwise followed the recipe. Oh yes, following other suggestions, omitted the celery root. Thanx.

Question: has anyone successfully frozen these in advance and then heated them? If so--how did you do it?

This got rave reviews at our annual Latke party. We continue to make "basic" ones with sour cream and apple sauce for the kids but this recipe knocked the socks off of the grownups. To the cook who didn't know why the oven was turned on - it's to keep the latkes warm. :)

Bold flavours that blend wonderfully... Serve for lunch with a salad. I, too, followed the recipe and found the pancakes separated in the pan. Will make adjustments. Otherwise: YUM.

This is a great recipe but I do not understand why the oven must be turned on. There is nothing to do wih the oven.

Have made this for the past 3 years and continue to get rave reviews. The onion, apple, and celery root all complement very nicely and the horseradish/creme fraiche tops it off very nicely. Yum!!!

Great recipe-this is the second year I am using this recipe to rave reviews from all! I don't use the celery root or green onion. Do use whatever apple I have available and dried marjoram and they are terrific. It is important to measure and flatten each pancake-they are just the right size and cook up very crispy. A real keeper.

I served this to my husband for Sunday brunch, the apples and onions mixed with the potato was delish! Like many others, I did not add the celery root with no dire consequences. This one is a keeper...

This is a wonderful recipe that I will definitely make again. New year's Eve sounds like a great idea. I really liked all the ingredients, but I agree that the celery root is easily expendable if you can't find it. You also use so little of it. I found the mixture messy to work with but it held together for the most part. I did find that a hot pan helped. I was very surprised by how much my wife enjoyed them as she normally refuses to eat onions. I found the crisp onions delightful and she did not know she was eating them, perhaps because of the flavorful horseradish cream. Maybe the only thing I would do differently would be to sprinkle with some capers. These are a wonderful treat with a sparkling wine.

This was SO good!! I made it as an appetizer for Christmas eve and it was a big success. I did eliminate the celery root and peeled the apple but otherwise was true to the recipe. I made the pancakes a little ahead of time and then reheated them in a warm oven and assembled them before serving and topped them with a little diced red onion.( Even cold they were excellent.) Will definetly make them again....and again. Merry Christmas.

Excellent - best recipe for potato pancakes I have tried. (Before serving, press between 2 paper towels to reduce oil)

Savory and delicious with an impressive visual.

These were the bast latkes I've ever tasted. The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks is because they tend to fall apart in the pan and absorb too much oil. I followed the recipe exactly and squeezed all the juices from the mixture. Still, I have no idea what went wrong.

The combination of flavors was exquisite. This is a special-occasion dish that I will definately make again.

Wringing out all the excess liquid make these latkes so crisp. I did not use the apple nor the celeriac, but I used the recipe for the guidelines. They were the best I have ever tasted. Rave reviews.

I didn't know what celery root looked like and brought horseradish instead. The pancakes were delicious as was the horseradish sour cream. My kids liked it and so did my husband who hates sour cream. I will use celeriac next time, though. The whole combo was very tasty.
