This is going into my top 10 chicken recipes file. It's light but had a great flavor. I used bone in breasts, but after reading some of the reviews I think I would use thighs for guests. Breasts take up too much space in the skillet. If you had many guests you would have to use 2 or 3 skilets. My wife does not like "spicy" things, so I only used a 1/8 teas. of pepper flakes. I served it with Angel Hair Pasta

I just got done making and eating it. It was so good that I immediately saved it to my recipe box. I used 4 pieces of bone in/skin on thighs. I also pour the wine first then boil off the alcohol before putting in the chicken stock. I prefer this method with most of my wine infused dishes. I served it over white rice. Perfect 2 people dish that's truly yummy.

Took under 45 min. Probably because I halved the recipe and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead. I also used leeks instead of onions, and threw in all the veggies at once. Even the sun-dried tomato, because sometimes it's too assertive for me, and I thought it would be mellower if cooked in with the wine instead of thrown in last. I used thighs because I wanted more flavor. I'm glad I used thighs because the sauce was rich and flavorful. I used a Malbec. The chicken was good and tender, but to be honest the stand out is the sauce and the mushrooms that soak up all the flavor, (I just used creminis). I served it on a bed of greens, with a side of rice. I'm sure this can easily be made vegetarian by using thick slices of portabella. Next time I want to try serving it with mashed potatos, or polenta to really make the sauce stand out.

terrific and easy to make. I doubled the recipe. Used sun dried tomatoes and re hydrated in H2O Served the first night over mashed potatoes [my weakness]Shredded the remaining chicken into sauce and added roasted peppers the second night over pasta with parmessan cheese sprinkled. Still more left which I will freeze for later use.

I used 3 boneless, skinnless chicken thighs and red wine (didn't have white) and didn't use parsley (didn't have any of that either). Still very good. My husband rated it a "do-over". I served with a simple veggie (sauteed zucchini squash) and crusty bread to soak up the sauce. Will make again.

I made this for my husband and he absolutely raved over it. I followed the recipe, but used skinless, boneless chx thighs, and a hefty amount of crushed red pepper - divine! I served it with red skin potatoes mashed with some creme fraiche and stone ground mustard, and a good red wine. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is very good. Not too overpowering but well balanced and flavorful. I wanted my chicken to be very tender so I did what others suggested and after I browned the chicken, I made the sauce and poured it over the chicken in a cast iron baking dish. I baked the chicken, covered with foil, for an hour or more at 300 degrees. We served it with white rice cooked in chicken broth, tossed with fresh parsley. I will make this recipe for company. Nice presentation!

Followed the recipe as written except I used boneless skinless thighs. Also, omitted the buerre manie (my son has a dairy allergy). Everyone truly enjoyed this. It took less than 45 minutes. I served this with angel hair pasta (as per the suggestion below). Will definitely make this again!

This is fantastic!! I must have printed this recipe out 3 years ago and never made..but was hunting for something containing the ingreidents I had. I used free range boneless breasts, a mix of shitake and crimini mushrooms. I did NOT used sundried tomatoes in oil, but rather the very soft & tender ones vacuum packed in produce section. And the surprise: turns out I had picked up SMOKED sundried tomatoes. Entire dish was fabulous..sauce thickened beautifully. Served with couscous. Can't wait to make again exactly the same way - this time for company. AND took 45 min or less for sure. VERY easy (cut veggies while chick browns)

How exciting to find a recipe for 2 individuals! My husband prepared this dish following the recipe to the letter. We considered having it with pasta, but ended up serving it with roasted brussel sprouts instead. The chicken and sauce were very rich, and we were glad that we hadn't gone with the pasta. We'll definitely make this dish for company due to the beautiful presentation.

I was in a screaming hurry this evening and I swear it took me less than 45 minutes to make. I probably fudged the measurements a bit (threw in extra mushrooms and wine/broth mix). I added about half a cup of heavy whipping cream at the very end - fabulous! And I served the whole thing over angel hair pasta. My husband is on a low- fat diet so I set aside chicken and sauce before adding the butter/flour mix and he was perfectly content. Once we all adjusted for individual salt tastes, the family (ages 6 to 82) agreed, we'll do it again.

This was good except that it took much longer than 45 minutes for me to prepare. Just prepping the veggies and browning the chicken pieces alone took about 15 minutes, then the onions and garlic, another 8,then the mushrooms, another 6 or so, then the simmering for 20 minutes. I cooked one boneless skinless chicken breast and 3 bone in thighs and more than enough sauce. Plus it made 4 servings. Leftovers were YUM.

I also added a chopped red bell pepper to carmelize with the onions. Yum!

I didn't have the sun dried tomatoes and added extra herbs instead. I also omitted the butter from the sauce and it was still very rich and velvety, but I would not attempt this with bland skinless/boneless breasts! Everyone here is fighting over the leftovers. This recipe is a keeper!

Rating: 2
I followed the advice of others and used boneless, skinless chicken breast (it's all I had). I found that the sauce was not creamy enough without the fat from the skin and bone, so I ended up adding more chicken broth. I also over cooked the chicken. I will make this recipe again and use bones and skin and cook the chicken for 10 minutes instead of 15.

Rating: 4
Because of a mushroom allergy, omitted the mushrooms. I browned the skinless, bone in chicken breasts in a cast iron skillet. Transferred this to a covered braising pan and stuck it in a 325 oven. Made the tomatoe sauce as directed but lightly processed the sundried tomatoes before adding. Poured the tomatoe over the chicken and finished in the oven. I served this with creamy polenta and it was heavenly.

Wonderful! I used dry Marsala instead of red wine and it was perfect. The sauce was intense and rich and tasted great. My husband is all about the sauces and he was most pleased.

I made quite a few changes, but really liked what I ended up with. I had no tomato paste, so instead I used a few table spoons of a Sun Dried Tomato Bruschetta that I had from Trader Joe's. In addition to the sun dried tomatos it had green and black olives, tomato paste and spices. I also used 1/2 red wine and 1/2 Cianti Vinegar. It all worked and if I can I'll make it again.

I have made this several times. We love it. I use chicken thighs with skin and bones and extend the cooking so the chicken is almost falling off the bone.

I have made this recipe several times. But tonight I feel compelled to write a review. That's probably because I altered it so much. I prepared the recipe as stated, except I added a jar of Classico Sundried Tomato Alfredo sauce. Ack.. .!! Yes you read that correctly. We probably all have these staples in our cupboards, add a jar of Alfredo, some steamed broccoli and ta da you have a perfectly yummy low carb dish.

This is one of my favorite mid-week chicken dishes. I usually omit the mushrooms and that takes about 5 to 10 mins out of the cooking time.

I was pretty disapointed myself with this recipe. The chicken didn't have much flavor. The sauce alone with pasta was good though! I would not make it again.

After all of these rave reviews, I was a bit disppointed. I didn't think the sun-dried tomatoes added anything. In fact, they seemed to conflict with the rest of the sauce.....but then again the sauce wasn't anything special to begin with.

This was delicious. Followed it almost exactly but used 1/2 red wine & 1/2 balsamic vinegar and I was really happy with the zip the vinegar gave it. YUM!

I made this dish last night and the only thing I did different was I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. It was quite good, however, we found that there was far too much sauce for two people and it overpowered the plate. It should have been a compliment only. I served it with steamed buttered green beans and half a cheese stuffed baked potato each. I would halve the ingredients next time when making this dish for two again. However it was perfect for four servings. Other reviewers said they would serve this dish over pasta so in that case, there would be enough sauce for that. Anyway, I shall make this again and probably for company.

I followed this recipe pretty exactly, except that I didn't have dried basil so I used an "italian herb" mix. I also used a whole chicken and took the skin off before I browned it (trying to cut out some fat). I also cooked the chicken a lot longer than the recipe called for because our neighbor stopped by and wouldn't shut up and leave. Anyway, it turned out to be a very tasty dish. I gave it 3 forks, but my husband really loved it and said he could eat it at least once a week. He would probably give it 4 forks. I doubled the sauce because I was cooking more chicken. If you are a sauce lover, you would probably want to do that and add some more mushrooms.

Have made this twice now, and it is heavenly! Used boneless skinless breasts and Amore double concentrated tomato paste. The flavor is unique - rich without being too heavy. Gorgeous on the plate, and easy! Would make for company even though my husband says chicken is not for company! Wonderful flavors...the sun-dried tomato absolutely makes the dish.

WOW!!! This was great! I substituted chicken thighs (4) for the breast and used only about 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper flakes, otherwise, I followed the recipe. Next time, I'll try it with pork chops.

I make a lot of recipes off this site and am always pleased....this went beyond anything I had expected!!! I made it with boneless chicken breast and it was WONDERFUL!!! And I'm totally hooked on the butter/flour as a thickening agent now....WAY better than flour and water!! This was a HUGE HUGE hit in my house and the leftovers were fantastic too!!!

This was wonderful....I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine because I didn't have any red wine on hand (doesn't happen often!). It was fabulous. My husband likes mashed potatoes with this dish so he can eat them with a little of the sauce. Try balsamaic vinegar instead of wine. You'll love it!

This was so good! One of the critique people mentioned they increased the cream times 2. No where could I find cream in the recipe. But I added splashes of it & it was wonderful. Sauce enough for pasta. :( Unfortuntaly, I didn't plan on it for this time. It's a winner! And a keeper! Especially with the added cream/and or/1/2 1/2! Puzzled by the people that compared this to chicken caccitore or coq au vin. Doesn't taste anything like either to me. Both sauces are far more complex. And different from each other. Perhaps my recipes are different. They come from Italian cooks. UPDATE! I served the suace with pasta tonight. No guilt 'cause I didn't use any more meat products. It was wonderful for 2 of us. Garlic bread & salad. Like free food--almost!

Second time I made this I used Kalamata olives instead of sun-dried tomatoes... yummy! Used the sund-dried tomatoes for the risotto I served with it (excellent accompaniment).

Yet another great chicken recipe! I made this dish the first time with skinned, bone-in chicken breasts and found it a little dry. The second time, I followed the advice of another reviewer and threw the sauce over the raw chicken to bake in the oven. This turned out great. I think I will do this from now--less fuss and mess.

This was very tasty!! I would like to try adding some shiitaki mushrooms to enhance the flavor (though it is VERY flavorful with regular mushrooms)There was nothing left on our plates!! I also used boneless chicken breasts...less work while eating. This is definately a "do over".

I used bonless/skinless breasts and tomato sauce(was out of paste),and had no basil. It was still outstanding! My husband loved it. I think it'd be great over noodles or rice for that terrific sauce. I'm making this for company someday for sure. I think it would also be good with veal or a good filet mignon. I also used my all clad nonstick, and found that I only needed 1/2 tablespoon of oil to brown the chicken, onion, and mushrooms.

Like another cook, this recipe reminds us of coq au vin. I have made it for company, and some have asked for the recipe. We found, for our taste, that the sauce was adequate for 2 whole breasts.

Rating: 2
The recipe is quite tasty, but nothing more than a variation on a cacciatore (or even a coq au vin). The addition of red pepper flakes and sun-dried tomatoes was nice, but nothing that special. Moreover, the amount of sauce made when following the directions was more than enough-so much so that we served it over pasta to accommodate the extra sauce. Also, the dish is rich enough without the butter (but if you wanted to go over-board, it is a yummy addition).

This was GREAT. I added more garlic because we are big garlic fans. I listened to the cook from San Carlos, CA and only added 1 Tablespoon of oil and it was plenty. This would also be great with very large shrimp.

Instead of simmering the browned chicken in the saute pan, I put it in the oven (covered, to finish cooking) and then made double the sauce. I poured some of it over the cooked chicken, and then put some cooked spaghetti in the saute pan to coat with the remaining sauce. There wasn't anything left.

I made this for my very particular husband and he loved it. I did however double the amount of cream and wine so that there would be more sauce and I usd chicken cutlets which worked very well.

LOVED this recipe. I made it for a family dinner and doubled the recipe. Used a mixture of boneless & bone-in chicken pieces - but the boneless pieces became dry in cooking. I'll use small pieces of bone-in chicken next time. Use a good quality wine - a Zinfandel or Pinot, and it is fabulous. If using a non-stick pan, I thought that 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons of oil was too much - 1 Tablespoon was plenty.

I loved this dish, however, I did not like the raisins. Next time I will try apricots.

The chicken breast I used for this recipe were too big, thus the juice was far too reduced by the time the chicken was done. Next time, I'd use smaller chicken breasts AND increase the broth and wine (I like lots of sauce). Also, because it cooked for so long, I found that I didn't really need the butter/flour past to thicken.
