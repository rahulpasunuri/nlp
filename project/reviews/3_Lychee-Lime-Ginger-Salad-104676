I get Brewster lychees here in south Florida. Just how easy they are to get off the pit (and off the skin)depends on just how ripe they are. The less ripe ones are more difficult to separate. Store in fridge as they go bad quickly. When very ripe they pull away easily from the pit. There is NO comparison between fresh lychee and canned, but they do not travel well and outside of south Florida and outside of May-June, the fresh ones are unlikely to be found. I like this recipe but used just a small grating of fresh ginger and added a sprinkle of coconut on top.

How is taking a lychee off its pit impossible? I didn't seem to have any trouble separating it from the seed! I don't see why anyone would eat this if they weren't off the seed. This is a great way to use up lychees that are getting moldy at the end of the season. The shells on mine didn't look so good but the fruit inside was still delicious!

If you don't like ginger, stay away from this recipe. Seriously, find another one. If you're a fan of ginger, this recipe is wonderful and refreshing.

I found the ginger over-powered the lychees. Much better to simply eat canned lychees in their own juice!

This was a good refreshing fruit salad. We are not great fans of candied ginger (in fact despise the stuff) so next time I will try mixing the candied ginger with the lime juice upfront for a few minutes and then strain the lime juice to pour over the lychees. The ginger did give the lime juice an added kick so I am hoping this variation will work to impart the hint of ginger but without having to eat it!
