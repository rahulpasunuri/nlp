Amazing! didn't start this dessert until 5pm for a 7:30 dinner - no problem. If you're not practiced at caramel - then do like it says and make it before (it will keep in the fridge - and you can pour it over ANYTHING). Didn't have any dark rum - used Makers Mark bourbon - insanely good. Was worried about the custard mixture being too liquidy - but thickened up in the oven. Used hot dog buns leftover from last weekend's bbq.

Delicious way to deal with all the bananas getting ripe on the same day. I used large croissants (about 7 will weigh one pound), which adds to the richness -- but you don't have to cut off any crusts. I baked it in a high casserole dish. I chilled the leftovers, sliced into 1-inch-thick pieces, sauteed in butter, and served with maple syrup and a few fresh banana slices. Makes a fabulous breakfast!

Wonderful banana flavor! I heated the cream for the caramel as recommended by some of the other reviewers and didn't have any issue with clumping. Also, I remember a chef I took a class from once told me that sugar becomes "angry" if you stir it too much when making a caramel and it best to leave it alone if at all possible. So I just coaxed the sugar a bit to melt and no lumps

Great taste, the sauce with the pudding is really good! Serve it warm for the best flavor, I used spiced rum to add a little more kick to it!

I made this recipe to use up some challah bread that had been getting stale, and WOW is this pudding good. I even ate it cold for breakfast the next day. YUM. I had some of the Argentine jarred Dulce de Leche caramel stuff with it, and couldn't ask for more.

This is the BEST! It might be a little time consuming but well worth it. I get nothing but rave reviews every time I make it. VERY rich and gooey. The best bread pudding I've ever eaten!

oh.my.goodness. I made this last weekend for family in town and it was amazing. i almost wish i would have saved it just for me! i used challah instead of brioche, and for the pudding i only used 1 c whipping cream and 2 c 2% milk - taste was just as good as restaurant bread pudding but not quite as heavy. YUM.

This recipe was delicious but much more time consuming than other bread pudding recipes. Next time I would either purchase a good quality caramel sauce and add a little rum to it, or use another caramel sauce recipe. Also, I did this in individual ramekins and needed more bananas. It's definitely worth repeating.

I warmed the cream, per the reviews, and had no problems. This was really good BUT so heavy and filling! I would only make it again for a very large dinner party.

Only one small clump in the caramel, which I ate thereby gaining the first of 10 lbs. Clumping may be caused by the sugar getting too hot, keep the temp low and stir rapidly as you add the cream. Licking the wooden spoon and pan added another few lbs. This caramel is soooo good. The whole dessert is terrific.

Amazingly tasty. Love it! Didn't have problems with the caramel like some others did. I strained it per the directions and it turned out fine. BUT it took a long time to make. Although it was really good, I won't make it again because its too much of a hassel.

Very good, the banana flavor is very strong, especially in the left overs. I used half & half instead of cream in the caramel and only skim milk in the custard and it still turned-out great. My husband was skeptical of the name, but he has been raving since his first bite.

Made sauce as per recipe and clumps were gone in just a few minutes. Surprisingly pleased that this was not icky sweet..really rounded and balanced. Delicious.

Really amazing. Not cloyingly sweet and the rum and banana combination is classic. Used Challah bread instead of Brioche which worked well.

After reading about everyone's problems with the caramel sauce I decided to warm the cream in the microwave and gradually add it to the caramelized sugar. Worked perfectly and took about 10 minutes for the whole process. I would make this recipe again as some individuals remarked that it was the best they ever ate. I liked it too

This was fantastic! I took it to a dinner party and got rave reviews. Even the anti-dessert folks ate some and loved it! I didn't have any of the problems described with clumping but I did pour all the cream in at once and stirred quickly. I will definitely make this one again!!

This turned out beyond fantastic. When I made the caramel, the sugar did clump up a bit because the cream was colder than the sugar, but maybe if it is room temperature it won't clump as much? After a few minutes of stirring it was fine. For the pudding I used Challah bread from Trader Joes - the whole thing turned out fantastic. Probably won't make it again because I felt 10 lbs heavier after eating some. Very good though!!

I should note that the process to unclump took about 20 minutes.

I have never made caramel with powdered sugar either....when I added the cream a majority of the sugar turned into a clump; however, I turned down the heat and took my wooden spooned and worked it until it melted. I turned the heat down so the caramel that didn't solidify didn't burn. I haven't made the remainder of the dessert yet (tomorrow night!) so hopefully it will all work out well. I could not find brioche so I had to make my own (which was a trial unto itself).

the same thing happened to me....hard rock like clumps...this is the first time i've made caramel with confectioners sugar...could it be the cornstarch ?(it is listed as an ingredient in confectioners sugar ) i have made caramel many times with regular sugar and was always successful..

Have just attempted the caramel sauce. Once the cream was poured in, most of the sauce curdled into solid, unmeltable globs. Anyone else make out better? Followed the recipe to a T - can't figure it out.
