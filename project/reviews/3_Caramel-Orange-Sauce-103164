I've made caramel-based sauces many times, and disliked this one very much. Followed recipe exactly. Found it tooth-achingly sweet, orange flavor subtle (which was fine) but much to sweet to put on anything else. Even by itself it was more like the sweetest possible toffee.

I lightly drizzled this on a fresh fruit salad, it was fantastic, rave reveiws from all who tried it.

Delicious and wondeful over Vanilla Icecream and a thin wafer biscuit. Next time I make it I will try it over roast pork.
