Way too much work for mediocre dolmas. Save yourself the headache and buy some from a trusted Middle Eastern deli.

Fabulous recipe! I've made this recipe several times and love it!! I know that some people skip the currants - I STRONGLY advise against this. The curants add such an interesting flavor. Technically, you can leave them out. But when you go through so much labor to make these - why not have them perfect? On the down side: Occasionally I have found that the white rice can over cook (depending on what part of the pot the individual wraps are simmering.) However, brown rice (being a bit more firm in general) does not have this problem. I also use Hot Turkey Italian Sausage - great flavor and not as many calories!

Absolutely fabulous recipe! The filling is great. Used mild sausage instead and turned out just great. Filling can be used to stuff cabbage as well. Does take a long time to roll these. Definitely do in two days as recommended. I killed a full day doing by myself.

Made filling day before and enrolled a helper for rolling. This really isn't that bad labor wise if you prep wisely. I was complaining more about the quality of the grape leaves than anything else. I was in Switzerland and could only get Lebanese leaves and some were very small. Larger grape leaves would have made this a breeze. I followed the ingredients exact (A MUST). Undercooked the rice a bit the day before as to have it absorb a bit in the cooking process, to which I added some white wine. It made a subtle but very tasty difference. Presented layered on platter rigned with sliced lemons and sprinked with pine nuts.

now i don't need to go to the greek restaurant to get my fix anymore! these turned out even better than i thought they might! although it takes a decent chunk of time to make these, each step is simple enough for an inexperienced cook and you could easily prepare the filling a night in advance... the flavors might even be more developed if you did. to make mine a bit healthier i used a spicy turkey sausage and about half the olive oil and a low sodium broth. i also omitted the currants and dill and used short grain brown rice... and they were delicious... this is a huge recipe, so if you are just looking for dinner, cut it into a third.

This is an excellent recipe. I substituted my own sausage recipe (somewhat sweet and hot) and used regular parsley without any problems. I also added some Fines Herbs in the mixture to add a depth of flavor. I think the time may be a bit misleading. Although I made only a half batch, my prep time was only about 2 hours. I think it boils down to how fast of a stuffer/roller you are. All in all, this is well worth the effort.

Would someone please make this and let me know if it's worth it? I'd like to do it for Christmas but I don't have time to be the guinea pig in the meantime :) Would like to substitute the rice for something because we don't eat it in our house. (Mushrooms, maybe?)
