Tried out this weekend and took to a dinner w/ friends. For me the mustard flavor was too strong (used a mid-quality Dijon) and would have decreased by tablespoon. But for friends mustard taste was great. I doubled recipe and had plenty of leftovers for four people. The mustard flavor becomes more mild on second day and the basil flavor starts to shine through. So depending on how you like the two flavors, may want to make a day in advance. We omitted the salt bc the mustard was salty enough. Kept pepper which I think is mandatory as it gives a deeper balance. So taste before adding. Think this would be a great sandwich spread!
