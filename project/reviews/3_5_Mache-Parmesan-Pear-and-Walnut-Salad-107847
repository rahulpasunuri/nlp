Great salad! I used a mix of butter lettuce and "field greens" (closest thing to baby greens at the grocery store). I forgot to peel the pear, but it was fine anyway. I think it would also be good with other kinds of cheese.

We have made this salad many times for guests and I am always asked for the recipe. I usually cut back on the Parmesan cheese a bit, and when we don't have sherry, I've substituted red wine and it is still delicious. I very rarely have leftovers with this salad.

I am one of those strange folks who just can't get to liking blue cheese. This salad was a perfect alternative and kept my guests happy too! I used Bibb lettuce and added a dollop of honey to the dressing. Wonderful! It's going into heavy rotation at my house.

Very elegant little salad. Used baby spinach and mixed baby greens. I slightly altered the dressing: used 1.5 TB sherry vinegar and 1.5 TB pear vinegar, and replaced 1 TB of olive oil with walnut oil.

Fantastic alternative to the standard blue cheese-pear combination. The flavors of the parmesian, toasted walnuts, and pears was balanced and flavorful. I used a baby mesclun mix from my garden instead of the mache and Vinagre de Jerez sherry vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and my whole family just loved it.

This was great! Made it as part of a fancy spring menu,(with much more fancy dishes), and this one was the big hit of the evening! I used candied pecans, good quality parm, and forgot the shallots--everything tasted great!

I made this as a second course on Christmas Eve and my husband loved it, asking for seconds. The combination of pear and parmesan, plus the crunch of toasted walnuts was sublime. It was the first time I had used mache, which was a nice change from young salad greens. will make this again.

This is a lovely salad especially for those who don't enjoy blue cheese which is so often mixed with pears. It is excellent as written but can be easily adapted. Depending on what I have on hand, I have used shaved pecorino instead of parmesan, added fresh basil leaves, toasted pecans instead of walnuts, and subbed balsamic for the red wine vinegar - all nice variations. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

Great salad. I use mixed baby greens, but will try mache next time.

With a pear tree in our back yard, I am always looking for a new salad recipe in the summer. This was delicious and I particularily enjoyed the parmesan cheese.

I love this salad so much I had to review it again! I made it for a friend about a year ago and it has become a standard salad for our "chick nights" when we get together for dinner. I have added imitation crab meat to it for a dinner salad also and wanted to share that idea. Also you can add roasted chicken to make a meal out of it.

I don't want to rate this because I haven't made the whole recipe yet. But the sherry vinaigrette from this recipe has become our standard dressing for greens, it's so delicious. I make it several times a week.

I made this for Easter brunch and thought it was very good. However, I didn't get the raves others have - just one "nice salad Peg". Will definitely make again.

Great flavors in the salad. The mache lettuce is wonderful. Served it at a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful salad, I've made it several times for my husband & I. When made for guests, they ask for the recipe. Lovely!

We usually start each dinner with a salad and I'm always searching for new salad recipes. Many recipes combine pears and blue cheese, so this pairing with parmesan sounded intriguing and it was delicious. I'm adding it to my recipe box. We loved it and I can't wait to serve it to guests.

You really can't go wrong with this. I personally enjoy a little crumbled blue cheese in this sort of salad, but it was fine with just parm.

Made this for Thanksgiving; used red-skinned pears and sprinkled pomegranate seeds on top. Very festive and delicious. Received raves!

Absolutely divine! Have made many times...always to great reviews! Find that reducing dressing by half makes plenty for this salad.
