Not horrible, but dull, and I would not make again. There are far, far better pies out there.

My partner and I found this pie really tasty. I made a cream cheese crust instead of a regular crust which just complemented the flavors. Get a "microplane" which is a fabulous instrument to make zest from citrus fruits. It is so easy now to get lots of zest and we use it all the time. You can get it on Amazon.com for $9. We paid $18 at our local store! (TO make a cream cheese crust (not flaky): 1 cup flour + 6 tbs cold butter processed till it looks like little pellets. Add 4 oz cold cream cheese and process until ingredients gather together. I roll it out right away, place it in the pie plate and then will refrigerate it).
