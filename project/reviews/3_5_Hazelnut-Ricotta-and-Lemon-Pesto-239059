This flavor combination was pretty awful. My hazelnuts had been in the pantry a while though - perhaps that was what went wrong...

I LOVE this recipe. I do make a few substitutions though... I use pine nuts instead of hazelnuts, (because the store didn't have hazlenuts the first time I made it!) and I usually add about 1/4 C. of sourcream and cut the olive oil to 3 Tbs. This is a family favorite!

A quick, easy recipe that was really nice for a summer dinner. It was a keeper in our house.

Excellent. A lighter more delicate version of the traditional pesto. I served over tagliatelle with poached chicken. Halved the recipe and still have leftovers to use on eggs for breakfast!

Made this "pesto" last night with half a pound of pasta. I didn't see anything special about this recipe, and won't be making it again. There are plenty of other pesto variations that taste much much better.

I found this recipe to be a bit lackluster. Something was missing. I don't plan on making it again.

We had this last night. Very tasty. I didn't have hazelnuts or parmesan and substituted pine nuts and manchego - still a hit!

This was very good. The texture is creamy, without the sauce being too rich. I replaced some of the olive oil with a few tablespoons of hazelnut oil, and the flavour was fanstastic. Did anyone try to freeze the leftovers?

Great alternative to traditional pesto. This would be awesome on pizza as an alternative to white pizza.

Awesome twist on traditional pesto. I served this with pasta and it was big hit. It tasted equally as good served warm or cold.
