Incredibly good. I substituted thin-cut steak for the lamb and used dried dill. Instead of eating it as a salad, I sliced up the steak and wrapped everything up in pita bread. It was a perfect meal. I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

This one is difficult to rate because it is in two parts. The lamb was fantastic. Mine took a bit longer to cook to medium-rare but they were thick. The salad was very good, but next time I would serve it in a separate dish because of the runoff of dressing/juices from the tomato. The dressing seemed thin but was tasty.

The best food I have ever made! Perfect! I only changed the dressing: subbed olive oil for the yogurt, and added oregano like my "Joy of Cooking" directed. I need to find more uses for fresh dill.

I've only made the salad, but it was so awesome! I didn't have scallions on hand, so I substituted about 2 tbsp capers. This salad was simply perfect.

Wonderful recipe. Was concerned I might overcook the lamb being so close to the broiler heat...but it was perfect at 3 minutes per side for rarish meat.

Yummy yum! We left the chops to marinade 20 min in fridge and then 20 min to drive to a friend's for a dinner party. Really just 3 min broil then turn and 3 min was perfect. Also made a couscous pilaf, which worked great with the mediterranean salad. Used 2x the yogurt, was good. We doubled and a half the recipe for 4 people. The rib chops we got were smallish, 3 was probably the best number for hungry people. Everyone happy!
