Great technique for balsamic onions. Quick and easy. I didn't do all the herbs b/c I was including them onions in a salad with a different flavor profile. Just the olive oil before grilling and a toss in balsamic and s&p turned out very tasty. A new go to for salads and pizza.

Easy and delicious. Have this as a staple of every bbq as you can add it to the side of the grill. It is fantastic.

This recipe is excellent! I made some for my family, had quite a bit left over, so I ate every last slice of onion! lol We all loved it, even my 3 year old daughter!

Great recipe to complement grilled meats. I would definitely recommend using toothpicks or bamboo skewers to hold the onions together next time. I brushed the onions a couple times during grilling with some olive oil and basalmic vinegar. The vinegar could use a longer infusion period to get more flavor out of the rosemary. I went very light on the parsely.

I also simplified this; I brushed with olive oil, and grilled a few minutes on each side. They fell apart a little, but I didn't lose much onion. My slices were about 1/2 inch thick. I didn't toss onions in a bowl, but just served with the balsamic vinegar sauce. The vinegar adds so much instense flavor! I will be adding a few drops of this magic stuff to all of my vegetables. It's wonderful with the sweetness of the grilled red onion. A definite quick summer vegetable!

This was a very easy recipe to make. As I was in a hurry and not able to keep an eye on grill, I put the ingredients into a baking dish, poured the vinegar solution over the onions and baked them (open). They were wonderful!

This was easy and good. I soaked toothpicks to hold the onions together. I used my Misto with Rosemary-garlic olive oil to spray thin layer of olive oil.

Delicious! I've grilled onions before, but the balsamic vinegar adds an excellent flavor. The 1/2 cup of parsley was way too much though. I would recommend 1/4 cup. Note: Martha Stewart recently offered an excellent tip for keeping onions intact on the grill -- force bamboo skewers (soaked first in water for about 30 minutes to prevent them from burning) through the width of each onion slice. It really works!
