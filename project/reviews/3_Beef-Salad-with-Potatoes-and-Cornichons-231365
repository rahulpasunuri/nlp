This is a recipe to make when you're spending the day in front the fire with a good book and planning to settle in with a DVD later on. We loved the combination of cornichons, beef, green beans & potatoes -- and then there's the leftover beef & onions.

Really didn't like this at all. The combination of flavours somehow did not seem to mix/meld. Also, 2 tablespoons of the dressing on the potato left the potato very bland, whilst the meat/pickle mixed in with the rest of the dressing was overpowering. My partner felt the same and was not impressed.

This was good! It was a little different, but we really enjoyed it. I made it with what we had on hand. We had leftover corned beef from St. Patrick's day, so we used that. I didn't have cornichons, so I used some sliced pickle slices (envision little pickle matchsticks). But, the combination of the bibb lettuce, which was so tender, with the warm vegetables in vinaigrette and the beef was just sublime. I don't see us making this a lot, but when we have leftover beef we'll be sure to do this one. It strikes me as good, honest, delicious food.

The chuck steak is a very fatty component of the salad.....it was too greasy and felt very unhealthy.

We thought this salad was delicious. I didn't have the cornichons, so don't know if I missed them or not, but I'll definitely try them next time. I was also in a rush, so I peeled and sliced the potatoes and cooked them in salted water in a skillet. I also added hard-boiled eggs on the side. My husband loved this salad. We also loved the original roast this recipe started from.

I wasn't crazy about the wine-braised chuck roast, but it's much better dressed up in this salad. The cornichons are a great accent.
