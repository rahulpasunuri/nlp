I add just an advice: to serve the tuna with freshly toasted bread with with extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/italy/sicilian-tuna-carpaccio.aspx

This dish was a cinch to make, and delicious. I made it for my boyfriend who is a MUCH better chef than I, and he was very impressed with the presentation AND the taste of the dish. Used a salad mix as well, instead of the watercress, and also served it with a small side of pasta with a nice forest mushroom sauce, as per a previous reviewer suggested. Overall a very nice, light meal, with very subtle flavours. Will mos def make again!

Excellent! I was looking for a tuna carpaccio made Italian style, not American style and this is it! Most of the American style recipes had the tuna being marinated in lemon or lime juice overnight....tuna ceviche? I didn't think the chives added much to the recipe and can be left out IMHO. I served it with arugula, not watercress, and it was very good. I served the carpaccio as an appetizer and made some fettucine with forest mushroom sauce as a main course. The earthiness of the mushrooms, the peppery arugula and the dijon and the light cold tuna was perfect!

Changed out the dressing. Use EVOO, wasabi, soy sauce, and touch of Dijon. Overall, good and impressive visual.

this was delicious and very easy. If you love beef carpaccio and/or sushi tuna, you will love this. all three of my 'middleschool age' boys love this. I sometimes add a little freshly shaved parmesan. Also, I don't often have 'watercress' so I simply substitute any other bagged salad mix that i have on hand. I serve this with crunchy french bread on the side. Wonderful and healthy!

This was melt-in-your-mouth tender and kept it's pretty pink color.

This recipe is so easy and yet so full of flavor. Having eaten at Le Bernardin many times (Always Great)It was nice to create this as a first course at home. Everyone enjoyed it and the presentation is dramatic.
