I just thought this recipe was Good. It took 7 bags of baby spinach. If faced with a do-over, I would use chopped frozen spinach (drained and dried extremely well). The puff pastry tasted best when first out of the oven, but since I was serving the next day at my holiday party, I kept in the fridge overnight. I thought the dough turned a tad flat and thick the next day. I would substitute phyllo dough next time to see if that would work better. Other than that, very easy recipe and it seemed to be eaten, however, there were a few remaining pieces after my party. Great minty/dilly flavor of the authentic Spanakopita I wanted to duplicate.

Love the fresh dill and mint in this recipe!!! Will be using this recipe whenever I am in the mood for spanakopita

This was delicious! Other people changed the recipe, and then reviewed it poorly. Don't change it! It is perfectly balanced so reducing leeks or spinach would make it overbearing, and removing dill or mint would make it boring. MMMMMM!

The filling was delicious and like most reviewers, I did reduce the amount of leeks and next time will increase the amount of spinach. I used the recommended 9x13 baking dish but found the outcome to be very thin and next time will use a smaller dish.

This was very good and super easy! I cut into appetizer size cubes for a Superbowl party and served at room temp.3 leeks which was plenty. Dont get too hung up on the phyllo dough being too perfect. I cut into long strips that slightly overlapped and that made more crunchy surfaces when it was done instead of one giant slab. Makes sure they do overlap a bit though - I also poked a few steam holes in the strips. I bought frozen and used one slab for the bottom and the other slab cut into strips for the top Went a little heavier with the mint than the dill which suited my taste better -otherwise gets to dill pickle tasting. Needs no other seasoning really - DO NOT ADD SALT. I used a bit less than 2 lbs spinach (prob really 1 1/2 lbs) and only 1 cup feta. Probably would have been better with at least another half cup, but 2 cups may be too much. lined bottom of pan with parchment paper which i think cut down any oiliness and made it easy to keep from sticking.

Skip the nasty combination of dill and mint. Freshly grated nutmeg is the ususal spice in spinach pie and tastes much better. I have to use frozen Athenos Filo (phyllo) sheets and frozen spinach. Fresh is too costly, except in the summer. I also don't drain all the vitamins down the sink, but add the liquid to tomato juice or put it in the Scotty's dinner. I skip the eggs, too. This filling is also good in phyllo triangles, which make good appetizers. I live alone, so I make smaller pies and partially bake them before putting the extras in the freezer. This works with the triangles, too.

I used 3 leeks in the recipe and I felt it was more than enough. The mint and dill were a little too overpowering for my tastebuds. Also- could of been my feta cheese- it tasted too salty in the end.

I used a combination of fresh spinach and frozen chopped spinach, but mostly fresh. 3 leeks. Puff pastry. I have to say, rolling the pastry out was tough, but it did make a yummy crust. I didn't have a full two cups of feta and I think I missed the saltiness of it in the end. I found the herbs a bit overpowering.

I really liked this one. I usually make appetizer-sized Spanakopita (flag-folded in Phyllo), and I may replace my usual filling with this one. The mint is quite nice in it. I used Phyllo- 3 sheets on the bottom, half the filling, then 2 sheets, other half of filling, and 3 sheets on the top. Used non-aerosol spray oil instead of brushing on. I agree with other reviewers- too many leeks. I cut them back to about half. Be careful about adding salt! I didn't put any salt in this, and the feta made it more than salty enough.

This was definitely delicious! I used lower fat and fat free feta and subbed in some egg substitute in addition to using 2 eggs (instead of 3). The dill and mint were wonderful. I can't wait to eat it as leftovers. I also used less feta than called for which made it less salty, I think it would have been even better if I had added just a few shakes of salt to the mixture.

Loved this recipe! I liked the idea of using puff pastry, it is nicer than thin filo and makes eating the finished product less messy. The flavors were wonderful. I loved the leeks. I only used 3 because of suggestions from other reviewers and because the leeks available at my grocery store were huge. That seemed to work fine. I also only used 1 pound of fresh spinach and that was plenty. I think the recipe is pretty flexible that way. One thing I might do next time is cook the bottom layer of puff pastry alone for a few minutes to see if that would make it more crispy. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this receipt and opted for the Philo pastry. Rather than 2 pieces total I used 3 on the bottom and 3 on the top and next time I may even use 4. I used only 3 leeks and found the flavor to be lovely when combined with the spinach, mint and cheese. As another reader stated, the mint is a must but I left out the dill (not my favorite). The overall cooking time was more like 45 minutes. As an interesting point, I was out of butter and used Bacel with the Philo pastry and believe it or not it was wonderful.

I thought it was very good. Even forgot to put the egg in once and it still was good. Great vegetarian dish. Definitely a regular dish in my house.

I used three leeks with the full amount of spinach, and that was just about right. The fresh mint is a must. But I found that the bottom pastry sheet didn't really cook through, even though I upped the heat. Better to skip it, really, or use phyllo sheets.

Made with puff pastry sheets and substituted frozen spinach because of cost ($1.39 frozen vs $37.96 fresh, I live in very rural area). Frozen spinach works very well and cuts down on prep time. The flavors were fantastic, however, I found the ratio of leeks to spinach was a bit too heavy on the leeks. Next time I might use 4 leeks and 3 1/2 lbs of spinach (or frozen equivalent). Don't skip the mint and dill, there is great flavor there. Also, if you're looking for a picnic dish that can be handled with your fingers, which spanakopita is very good for, roll the pastry out thinner, with the same amount of filling, and use a half sheet pan, instead of a 9x13 pan, which produces a nice thick slice, but is thick enough that it needs a plate and fork.
