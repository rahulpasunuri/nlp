This was pretty good. Used bread crumbs instead of bread soaked in milk and forgot to broil it for the last few minutes, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The kids and I thought it was pretty edible but the husband wasn't fond of the consistency of the sausage.

This makes a simple, hearty and satisfying dinner. We will definitely make it again!

Very good, great weeknight meal. I don't see why the previous reviewer would be put off by the appearance of the dish - it looked just like stuffed baked potatoes to us! I used a little less mustard and used sage instead of parsley.

Extremely flavorful, but the textures and colors made this dish unappetizing to my family.

This was good but I wouldn't call it quick like a previous review. Be prepared to spend about 20 - 30 minutes on prep. My husband thought the dressing was too mustard flavored - I will cut down next time. Overall, it was good but not something I will add to my repoitre. I don't even want to know what "pigs trotters" means in the introduction. A little ignorance sometimes is good...

This was easy and very yummy. I used turkey sausage and it was still great. I was not a fan of the salad, but I think that was due to the particular greens I used.

Delicious and quick. Next time I make this I will mix some of the scooped out potato in with the sausage mixture. I used a sage breakfast sausage which added an interesting flavor. The salad would be delicious on its own as well. I think the bake time is a little too short as I needed to bake it for about 45-50 minutes until the sausage was fully cooked.
