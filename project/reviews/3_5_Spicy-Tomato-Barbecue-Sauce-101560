Being such a big fan of all types of home-made BBQ sauces, when I found this I had to test it out. I really liked the overall taste of it, though I did find it to be a bit much on the tomato side. Anyways, I know there are a lot of BBQ fans out there and I just had to recommend (http://www.pickyvicki.com) their BBQ sauce is also fantastic, I just placed another order for the original yesterday :D

If you like vinegar this is good. I recommend that you add alot more ketchup or some tomato puree, I added alot of ketchup to it and turned out to be an excellent sauce for ribs and hamburgers. It's a really good recipe it just needs a few changes to the amounts, like alot less vinegar.

A delicious sauce, quite powerful in flavor so as to stand on its own as an accompaniment to chicken simply grilled. It may be that because I did not have the sweet gherkins on hand, so instead subsituted some forgotten hamburger pickle chips I'd found in my fridge (ugh - don't ask) which actually tended toward sour, I found it necessary to add some powdered ginger and a little more brown sugar than the recipe called for to sweeten it up a bit. This may also be why I felt the sauce was too vinegary, which actually helped to preserve it quite nicely for over a week - the flavor improved with time. Lastly, next time I make this I'll cut the celery seed slightly - slightly dominant for my taste.

Incredible on grilled, skewered shrimp with bacon. Wow! We highly recommend this sauce, and cannot wait to try it on other fare. We served the skewered shrimp with the grilled veggies with 8 spices, also found on Epicurious... divine!
