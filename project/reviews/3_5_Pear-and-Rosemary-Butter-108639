I love the well-rounded flavor of this pear butter, especially the vanilla bean which is the most pronounced flavor (besides the pear of course). There is just a hint of rosemary and balsamic vinegar. I'm going to get some brie and warm it up, and serve it with a baguette & sauvignon blanc as some other reviewers suggested!

This is wonderful for topping toasted sourdough or baguette bread with brie- a nice snack or appetizer with pinot grigio or sauv blanc!

I canned this into 8 half pints last night. I thought it was delicious and complex in flavor.

I thought this was great--a perfect use for rosemary left over from the farmer's market, and very simple to make. It does make a bunch, so be ready to share with friends. I'm thinking of using some of the extras in a cheesecake. Either way, a great recipe!

An absolutely wonderful recipe! Delicious and very easy, with just a hint of rosemary. Great for dieters because it uses no sugar. I added a bit more juice when simmering the pear pieces because it got a little dry. I'll probably make this by the bushel and put it in jars to give as gifts at Christmas. So yummy!

This took alot longer to reduce than the recipe says, so make sure you have alot of time to wt=atch over it. This is great, with a different taste because of the rosemary, and it smells great. I put it on fresh scones-yummy. I'm also going to try it as an h'orderve for a party, with brie and bagette. Overall, very good. It makes alot, so freeze some of it.
