Made these twice in the past using Nutella because I couldn't find hazelnut butter. After reading reviews thought I better try with pure hazelnut butter. What a difference! When made with Nutella they are not the same cookie. Could not find hazelnut butter anywhere so had to order it on line but worth the expense. Do try with the real thing, these are wonderful little jewels!

These cookies are delicious! I had trouble finding hazelnut butter, so I made my own. My only suggestion would be to make sure you add oil when making the hazelnut butter, or else the cookies might be a little dry.

These cookies are so amazing! I always make the same delicious chocolate chip cookie recipe, but I might have just found a new favorite. They're like explosions of Nutella. Every bite is just divine. I made my own hazelnut butter, which was super easy (toast hazelnuts at 350 for ten minutes, shaking once after five min; blend in food processor with 1/2 tbsp of oil for 5 min). Such a winner!

These have quickly become a staple in our house. Served warm, they are like a little like a warm Ferrero Rocher chocolate.

I made these with dark chocolate chunks instead of semisweet mini chips and they were delicious. I made my own hazelnut butter, which turned out to be very easy. Just blend about 2 cups of hazelnuts, toast for 5 minutes at 450 (F) and then put them in a blender until "liquefied." The butter took about 10 minutes, not including toasting time, but I was unable to find plain hazelnut butter at any stores near me.

This is my go-to cookie recipe. I use regular-sized chocolate chips and Nutella or chocolate hazelnut butter like many of the other reviewers. I recently tried them topped with a Nutella frosting, mmm! Here's the link to my blog entry on my most recent attempt: http://www.caseycooks.com/2011/03/hazelnut-chocolate-chip-cookies-with.html

This is a delicious cookie! I was unable to find hazelnut butter so I used almond butter instead. I am not sure how the people who used nutella could come up with a cookie even close to the one in the recipe as Nutella is hazelnut, but it has added ingredients. This is not a chocolate cookie as written. The almond butter was much more like a peanut butter. I only used a half bag of mini chips and it was plenty. The batter is pretty crumbly so be warned. Also, I only baked for 10 minutes and the cookies came out perfectly like I like them, slightly gooey :)

I love this recipe~!!!!! Not much of a sweet tooth but I could eat these cookies every day if I could. The taste of hazelnut and chocolate is very unique, I've never had anything this delicious~ I've tried this recipe with Nutella as per other reviewers but it doesn't do any justice to the recipe. You must try the recipe with the hazelnut butter which you can find in health stores. I followed the recipe to the T and the cookies came out just wonderful.

These cookies were really good. TIP FOR CRUBLINESS: I've made these a few times using homemade hazelnut butter. I've found that the cookies were softer and chewier if I added some oil to the hazelnut butter... So to make the hazelnut butter, I toast hazelnuts in a try in the toaster oven, peel the skins off (they come off easy after blackening the outside) - Then putting them in a food processor. Once they get to a creamy consistency, I put a few drops of oil in. This really improved the texture somehow. I happened to have hazelnut oil on hand, so I used that, but I bet vegetable oil would act similarly. Variation: I made a "sundae" out of these by putting the dough in about 6 ramekins - Once they are done, bring them out of the oven, empty them onto a plate and serve hot with vanilla ice cream on top. AMAZING!!!

I love these cookies! I used Nutella per the other reviewers' recommendations, and normal-sized chocolate chips, because that's what we had in the kitchen. They taste wonderful, and turn out almost meringue-y in how light and crunchy they are. I've already made these twice, once for my mom & I, and once to impress my coworkers!

I think I have to stop trusting the forks on epicurious. I now have a huge bag of these in the freezer. There is something they lack...I think it might be salt but I'm not sure. I even added some orange zest and chopped hazelnuts to some of them...still too crumbly and buttery in a bad way and not much better in the taste department. Maybe they're better with nutella?

Rating: 4
I had to make my own hazelnut butter in the food processor. The texture was very crumbly and not creamy at all (don't know how to fix that). Even with the crumbly hazelnut butter, the cookies were excellent. What a wonderful, unique flavor! Next time I might try Nutella for some extra chocolate kick. I froze a lot of these cookies since it made so many and they are still delicious after thawing.

I made these for my BF who adores hazelnuts and I got a big thumbs up from him! I used hazelnut butter I got at a health food store, and the cookies did have a rich, nutty, almost smoky flavor. I think next time I'd cook them a minute or two less so they can keep their chewiness after they've cooled - they crisped up the next day a little more than I prefer. But fresh out of the oven, with melting chocolate bits - heaven!

Rating: 3
I did find the Hazelnut Butter and splurged on it. In the process I found some other nut butters that were easier to find and cheaper. If I make the recipe again I'll try almond or pecan butter - or maybe the Nutella, although I think that would be too much chocolate. I wasn't wild about the cookies, but my friends loved them.

Rating: 3
Really yummy. I "cheated" along with others and used Nutella--next time I want to try real hazelnut butter to get more nuttiness along with the chocolately aspect-Nutella is mildly nutty, but I think this would be even better if done as the recipe instructs. Used small chips as called for, and was glad-I like the balance rather than overwhelming the cookies with chips.

Rating: 4
I made these using homemade hazelnut butter (grinded 1 cup of toasted hazelnuts with 4 tbsp of vegetable oil) and reduced the amount of chocolate chip to 1 cup, as suggested by some of the reviewers. The cookies turned out amazing! They were chewy and really tasted like Nutella with the hazelnut chocolate combo. Definitely a new favourite in this household!

Rating: 4
These were absolutely wonderful! I took everyone's advice and used Nutella, because really, who needs an excuse to use Nutella? Also, I realized at the last minute we were out of regular salt so I had to freshly crack some Mediterranean sea salt instead- and I don't think I'd ever try it any other way! It reminded me of the salted caramel hot chocolate at Starbucks. I think I might put a little salt on top next time to really capitalize on that. The group I took them to went crazy over them. Normally they really like what I bake, but this time they went CRAZY! Haha. :)

You MUST try this recipe. I make cookies EVERY week and when I had these fresh out of the oven I was tempted to eat every one!!!! Make sure when you make them that you do not drain the oil out of the hazelnut butter that sits on top, use it all in the recipe. ENJOY!

I used hazelnut praline schmear (love-n-bake) instead of hazelnut butter and regular size chips. These cookies were AWESOME!!!

Rating: 4
Taking others' advice, I used Nutella instead of even trying to find the hazelnut butter. With all of the choc chips, they really ended up being chocolate cookies with very little hazelnut flavor, if at all. Next time I will half the chips to try to keep some hazelnut flavoring. Regardless, they are incredibly tasty and I highly recommend.

I made a minor change this time when I processed the hazelnuts to make hazelnut butter, I added 1 tablespoon of walnut oil. Significant improvement in the end product. The cookies have a better texture and the flavor is a little richer and fuller. From barely three forks to almost four.

Rating: 3
Hazelnut butter is just finely ground hazelnuts. Made it myself. Roasted raw hazelnuts, rubbed them with a kitchen towel to remove most of the skins and processed them until they were pretty smooth. Definitely underbake these. The full baking time makes them too crumbly. I used chunks of good dark chocolate rather than chips and got lots of requests for the recipe.

Hello! Ok I admit the hazelnut butter is impossible to find and Im NOT ordering online to pay ridiculous shipping however I did end up buying unsalted cashew butter and adding 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract. Though I could not find hazelnut and the jar of cashew was $5.79 $$$$$ it was really really good. I think next time I might just go with out the anything butter all together and just make chocolate chip cookies. All though these cookies were mouth watering I still think going threw all of the trouble to bake a cookie is a waste of time and money and unless you are a cook using the best ingredients don't want to waist your time.

Good luck tring to find Hazelnut - butter! I went to three different stores to find and could NOT! I went to a health food store and the lady looked at me like I was crazy or something! Thanks a Lot. I hope that the casiew butter that I'm using will taste good. That's all I could find and I'm not wasting anymore time. If you want to make acookie just do yourself a favor and just make chocolate chip. That's what I should have done in the first place! I hope this turns out good!

I made these with Hazelnut butter ordered online from Futters Nut Butter. They were delicious. The next year I used their Chocolate Cherry Hazelnut butter and substituted chopped dried cherries for the mini chips. Even better!

Diddo from the last review. These were great. I used nutella --- I figured since it has a creamier smoother texture, it would keep them soft. I used full size chips and they worked great. They are sweet, but they're nummy. I'll try them again with regular hazelnut butter.

substituted hazelnut butter for nutella and didn't skimp on the choco chips. as a chocolate fanatic, it was PERFECTION. i could see how it'd be too sweet for some, but not for us. i suggest underbaking a bit to keep them chewy--if not, they get crumbly. fantastic recipe.

This was great! I made it with macadamia nut butter instead of hazelnut butter (read the recipe wrong, had macadamia nut butter on the brain and in the kitchen) and it was still delicious. Very easy to make. I highly recommend using level tablespoons and forming balls before baking - the cookies come out perfectly round and crisp yet moist.

I was looking for a peanut-butter cookie recipe that I could substitute Nutella in and saw this - perfect! I think smoother texture of the Nutella kept the cookie softer and moister. Will definitely make again!

I love these cookies!! They are rich and unique. It's a little tricky to get all of the mini chips into the batter, but I like to pack as many in as possible. Also, they will get dry and crumbly fast if you over bake, so don't. I highly encourage you to track some hazelnut butter down (even though most other nut butters taste good in this recipe too). The additions everyone mentioned sound good. I'll have to try them!

Very good. I used cashew-macademia nut butter from TJ's. I added about a fourth of a cup macademia nut meal, 4 oz. of dark choc and 4 oz. of macademia nuts. I also skimped on the sugar. My husband thought they were so wonderful he did the dishes.

I've been making these cookies for years, but make a few substitutions that yield quite a sophisticated cookie with a hint of je ne sais quoi (i.e., the secret ingredient). I used almond butter b/c I couldn't find hazelnut butter and it works fine. I also tend to add some slivered or sliced blanched almonds and about 1/2 the amount of regular sized chocolate chips. Instead of vanilla, I tried rosewater -- that's the secret ingredient that has people back for more b/c they can't quite figure out what that hint of flavor is...

Geez I love this recipe! But I made a few wee changes. When I went to the health food store to buy the hazelnut-butter I was slightly shocked at the high price of it, so I decided to be adventurous, and easy on my wallet, and went ahead and bought macadamia nut butter instead. I also added 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract . So in the end these cookies turned out delcious and are a perfect milk dunking cookie.

Sorry to be a party pooper, but my family did not like this cookie. It depends on what texture you like, but we enjoy a soft, chewy cookie. This is more of a crumbly texture. I would not spend the money on Hazelnut Butter again for this recipe. I'm very disappointed as I thought this would be a keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and the cookies are fabulous! I did flatten the dough balls for part of the recipe with wax paper so the cookies are not so high and round. The delicious cookies are perfect for gift giving because of their exquisite taste and small size. Two friends have already asked for the recipe.

I couldn't find hazelnut butter anywhere on the East end of Long Island, so I used macadamian nut butter and ended up creating not just a cookie, but a work of art. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise and they were amazing. Use all the chocolate chips, you'll enjoy every last one!

delicious and perfect-looking every time! making the hazelnut butter in the food processor is a breeze as long as the nuts are already skinned. i have made the recipie twice, and the cookies taste wonderful - more complex than any plain chocolate chip cookie - and they look professional too. VERY easy recipie as well. i would use almost the full amount of chips - the first time i halved the amount and felt that there could have been more. this time i used just under the full amount, and it was perfect.

Rating: 3
I agree with other reviewers; you only need 6oz of chocolate chips. That's PLENTY for this recipe. I found hazelnut cream at Whole Foods/Fresh Fields in the peanut butter section. It worked like a dream; be advised you have to thoroughly mix the separated oil back into the cream before you add it to the recipe. But it gives a very nice depth of flavor.

I used regualr size chocolate chips (Ghirardelli double chocolate with bittersweet and dark chocolate). They were really too large for these small cookies and difficult to mix in, but the cookies were delicious. The flavor improves after a day or two in an airtight container.

Perhaps my expectations were too high, these are certainly good, but not quite as good as I was expecting. I was expecting more of a chocolate chip cookie texture, but of course these are more peanut butter cookie (crumbly) texture. If you're making your own hazelnut butter, it takes lots of nuts! I must have thrown about 2.5 cups of hazelnuts in the processer, and thought I would have lots left, but had maybe 2 T. more than the cup of HB needed.

I agree with the message before mine. Absolutely delicious - but the hazelnut butter was pricey. I cut the chips in half, which seemed right. I will definitely put this is my "yummy" file!!

YUMMY! The hazelnut butter adds a wonderful richness to plain ol' chocolate chip cookies. Due to the cost of the hazelnut butter though, ($7 for a jar at Wild Oats), these are not your child's cafeteria dessert. Oh and, BTW, if you accidentally leave them in the oven too long (oops, I did on the 1st batch... by about 15 minutes)... they are still wonderful!!! A little more crispy, but hey; some people like them crunchy.

I loved these. The hazelnut butter adds a great deal of depth to the flavor--much better than regular Toll House, in my opinion. As far as the butter question: I, too, had problems finding it. But you can actually make your own if you have a food processor. Just grind up the hazelnuts until they're pasty, then I just added a few tablespoons of unsalted butter to make it the right consistency. Then measure out your portion for the recipe. (Any leftover butter is terrific chilled, then sliced & used to garnish sauteed fish.)(Or another batch of cookies, since they won't last long.) Enjoy!

I would like to make this recipe, but I have a question for those of you who have made it. The closest to hazelnut butter that I can find is "Nutella", which is a combo of hazelnut spread, skim milk, and cocoa. When I tasted it, it tastes more like chocolate than anything else. I was thinking of using 1/2 Nutella and 1/2 regular old P.B. in the cookies, and then rolling each ball in slivered almonds before baking. I know that this would be far from the original recipe. Any comments would be appreciated. Thank you. (Oh, I did look at ordering the butter on-line at a site recommended by a reviewer: the cost of a 9 oz. jar was a bit over $6, a bit high, but OK. Then they tack on $7.45 for S&H. That puts the price over the top for this kid!!!)

Pasadena baker- This recipe will work fine with a cookie press. Chill the dough no more than 30 min.; just enough to make handling easier. Also,try to use a design that does not have many small "sections" so that the choc. chips will not get stuck. Good luck.

These were delicious. I thought the hazelnut flavor was just fine; maybe it depends on the brand of hazelnut butter. Our Whole Foods Market did not have any; I ordered it online from futtersnutbutters.com, and it came in about 3-4 days. I used 1 1/2 cups of the mini chocolate chips and I thought that amount was just right.

We had hazelnut butter at our local Whole Foods, but the great flavor of the nuts didn't shine through. Wound up rolling the raw dough balls in toasted chopped hazelnuts and then baking. That did the trick - great flavor. And yes, the recipe calls for too many chips. I increased the recipe by half yet the 12-ounce bag of chips was plenty.

Yum Yum Yum! Very easy to make - but I also had to make my own hazelnut butter - very easy in the food processor! I liked the amount of chocolate, but was concerned that it would overpower the hazelnut taste. All in all - very good cookies, flaky and rich!

Made these cookies this weekend. They are delicious. I'd also recommend using fewer chips - the amount that is called for is a little overpowering. I searched high and low for the stupid hazelnut better (in Boston!) and had no luck. So I roasted the hazelnuts and made the butter in the food processor - it was SO easy and made the house smell wonderful. It probably took 5 minutes with the FP. From now on I'll make my own hazelnut butter.

I also couldn't find hazelnut butter, my health food store used to carry it but had problems with the supplier. I used nutella instead. It added a bit more chocolate and darker color than the photo, but still works. I also think there are a bit too many chips, but I'm not a chocoholic. My 12-year-old son calls them addictive.
