Delicious dish and a huge success. Loved the roasted bell peppers with the tuna and the onions. I didn't have thyme so I used rosemary in both the foccaccia and the tuna marina, and it was wonderful. The only ting that didn't overly impress me was the foccaccia recipe, I will use my standard recipe instead the next time I make this. Definately 4 forks!

For all the trouble and great ingredients, this dish is quite bland even though I had added red pepper flakes and garlic to marinade. Went through the whole charcoal grill thing and couldn't taste the grilled flavor. Tuna was very dry although I cooked until just done. Needs pre-grill marinating and/or mayo.

It was okay, but I confess to changing it so...maybe that's why it was just okay. I used green onions instead of red. And I put it on whole grain bread, as a sandwich. Added some cheese on top and grilled it on my George Forman (don't laugh...it works really well for quite a few things) The tuna mix is dry, but the flavors are good. Just don't know what to do about the dryness.

This was absolutely delicious! The roasted peppers added a great deal of flavor. The first time I made the focaccia I rolled the dough too thin; I suggest using a pan smaller than the 13x9 recommended.

This recipe is simple, yet leaves you feeling like a chef and is as tasty as anything you'd by in a deli! I only tried it to use up extra tuna from our Y2K stash (I don't enjoy fish of any kind) and shocked myself by having seconds!
