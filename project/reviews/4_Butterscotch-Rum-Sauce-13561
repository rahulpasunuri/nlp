I love this recipe! Usually sub scotch for rum or leave out alcohol altogether. In addition to using it as a sauce I also cut the recipe in half and spread it in the middle of a two-layer chocolate cake below the frosting. It will be the only b/scotch sauce recipe I use in the future.

This sauce is fabulous. I've made it for gifts and have received rave reviews. I also kept some for my family who couldn't get enough of it.

The person who submitted this recipe conveyed the ingredients in the best way possible. Not only was the preparation time short, but the actual cooking time was brief and easy. The only adjustment that I made was when I substituted the rum for one teaspoon of rum extract. In the end, the sauce was smooth and very flavorable. I would recommend this recipe to my family and friends. Also, I've already added the recipe to my recipe box.

This sauce has a nice smooth rum fIavor along with the butterscotch. I made this for a gift and kept snacking before I got it completely finished. It is delicious.

I have made this sauce for Christmas presents since 1991. One year was missed and did I hear about it. The receipe is easy to quad. So make a large batch, put it in glass jars with a bow and have a great present. Enjoy!
