This was my first time making ribs, and as such I was very nervous, especially since my package of ribs said it would need 90 minutes to cook, instead of the 60 suggested in this recipe. I'm happy to report that the ribs were perfectly cooked just as the recipe stated. I only did pork ribs, as it was just my husband and I. He *loved* the sauce. I must not be a huge fan of sweet and sour, because it didn't really win me over, but he thought it was excellent, and that's high praise from someone who would prefer everything to be covered in barbecue sauce. I was very pleased with the cooking process and how it all turned out. It has encouraged me to try cooking ribs a second time, as they weren't nearly as hard to do as I thought they'd be.

This is the best marinade ever!

Excellent! Made with chicken, and smaller quantities. 1/4 of the recipe & 1/8 of chili & sriracha, and just marinated the chicken.

YUM. YUM. YUM! Delicious all the way!! I made this almost as written; I skipped on the pork ribs, as the beef and chicken would already be more than enough food for us. I still made the same amount of marinade, though, and glad I did. I only used one green onion instead of 9, as hubby doesn't care for onions much (and it still turned out fantastic!) I did not bother to remove the membrane from the short ribs--just means you have to cut around it when eating (no problem for us, but might want to remove for entertaining). For the hot sauce, I used Cholula brand. Prep-wise, the only mod I did was at the end--instead of grilling, I popped the meat under the oven broiler on 'hi' for 5 minutes each side, rack placed in the middle. Served with crinkle fries. Loved this, will absolutely make again and again!
