I really liked the strong almond flavour but I'm not sure I would say this is quick and easy. Peeling apricots is pretty messy and fiddly. I left out some of the sugar. The jam makes it sweet enough. I also made my own crust, adding the leftover egg white to the water. It came out light and very flaky.

This was good, not great. I love the almond/apricot combo but I have used these flavors more successfully in other recipes. Maybe the cream cheese threw me off?? That said, everyone else seemed to enjoy it and it disappeared quickly.

I made this dessert with fresh apricots from my tree. My husband pronounced it the best dessert he has ever tasted. I didn't have amaretto cookies, but we certainly didn't miss them. I also used half the amount of the almond paste, just because that was all I had in my freezer. This recipe is going into my recipe box!

Yummy and so easy to make! I made this as a last minute dessert for the 4th of July andit turned out great. I used canned peaches & fresh blueberries w/ store bought pie crust and drizzled homemade raspberry jam on top. Forgot the macroons but tasted great anyways. Next time I want to make this with homemade pie crust and all fresh fruit. Should be even better then!

I make this dessert all the time when i'm in a time crunch. In the Winter i use dried apricots and soak them in some tea to make them soft and then sprinkle some Grand Marnier or Ameretto over the apricots after i drain them. People love it no matter what fruit i use

I've made this several times with a lot of different fruits -- whatever I find that's fresh. Everyone loves it. My friends call it my "fruit pizza" and always ask for it!

Easy, flavorful, and a great showcase for fresh apricots! I'm going to try it with cherries next!

I made this for the 3rd time over the week- end, following every step of the recipe. I do love the recipe, but I think that less almond paste is the answer. So, do I add more cream cheese? Also, I think that it was a bit too sweet with the sugar, cookies and apricot jam. Next time, no sugar.

Made this for our dinner club the other night. Quick and easy as well as delicious. Used peaches though as apricots were out of season. Couldn't find the cookies so did without. Also tried with apples and ameretto. Would be perfect with homemade piecrust but who has the time?

Nice presentation and flavor. I've made this twice, first time with peaches, second with plums and peaches. Prefer the plum/peach combo. Both times made the crust instead of using ready made. Next time, will use half the amount of almond paste.

I made this with plums and really thought the almond overwhelmed the fruit taste. Probably half as much of the almond cream would have been enough for me.

checking out the ingredients, I thought it would be very tasty. I tried it with peaches,couldn't find apricots, it made a beautiful presentation, everybody couldn't wait to try it. It was just o.k. perhaps with a better crust? It needs something. I will try it one more time.

Since really good fresh apricots are hard to come by here and delicious Southern peaches are plentiful, I also made this with peaches and used homemade peach jam instead of apricot. My guests thought it was fabulous, I thought it was extremely easy and would definitely make it again.

sister and I made this for two family gatherings(different groups of people)and nobody was crazy about this dessert. I made it with peaches,but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My family's comment was, "don't bother making this again". It did make a nice presentation though.

Very easy, very good. I tried with apricots with OK results. I made it this weekend plums- it was much better (taste and looks).

Like another baker, I used fresh plums as there were no fresh apricots available. This was delicious, and I will certainly make it again, and try apricots. The almond flavor really comes through. Very easy, and a beautiful presentation, too.

Fantastic quick recipe. I substituted plums and didn't use amaretti...still great. If I had time, I would use home made pastry, but in a pinch, store bought worked well.

My new default dessert recipe! Easy, fabulous, looks wonderful--a winner!

This is a knock-out dessert - it will definitely be my new go-to recipe for summer entertaining. I substituted peaches for apricots and skipped the amaretti - and it was sensational. I bet it would be also good with plums.

This was absolutely delicious!! Just the perfect blend and ratio of almond to apricot flavor. I've got another one in the oven right now with peaches. Another favorite pairing!! Did I mention how beautiful the presentation is?
