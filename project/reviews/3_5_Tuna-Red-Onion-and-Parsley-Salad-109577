This is a simple recipe that I was able to easily make with leftover ingredients. Its probably the best tuna salad recipe I've had. The red onion and celery add a nice crunch and the parsley imparts a subtle tang. Delicious! This one is a keeper. I think capers and some crushed red pepper might go well too.

Quite good but a little too oniony -- recommend using only 1/2 of what it calls for.

I'm not sure how someone would say this is bland. I thought it was really flavorful! Here's my guess: if you use curly parsley, it's got a lot less flavor than flat-leaf parsley. I used flat leaf, probably was a little liberal on the lemon juice, and actually didn't have any mayo. But even so, it was really good.

This is a fresh, tangy, and crisp take on Tuna Salad. The lemon cuts the strength of the tuna which is nice.

This is a simple quick recipe for a slightly different twist on tuna salad. It's one of my favorites to take to lunch with veggies and crackers.

Really enjoyed the flavors of this recipe. The lemon zest added a wonderful touch. Might add some capers next time. Will defintely make again!

We've made this recipe about twice now. It's a pretty average, not bad, but not particularly amazingly wonderful, tuna salad. We used regular mayo, and just ate it plain, tho it would definitely be improved by serving it on some good bread. I also liked the recommendation to mix it with some pasta-I think we will try that next time!

A nice thing to do with this recipe is to mix it with pasta for cool summer salad.

I followed the reciped exactly, even using low fat mayonnaise, which is something I usually avoid. This is a flavorful salad and wonderfully lovely to present. Our guests at the pool party couldn't stop picking at it!

Excellent! Light, but very flavorful. Great substitute for traditional high calorie tuna salad. I made exactly as written. Always amazes me about this site how people make multiple substitutions, and then write a negative, or at best,a neutral review.

The lemon in this recipe puts a refreshing twist on an otherwise traditional tuna salad. I subbed one hard-boiled egg (coarsely chopped and peppered) for 1 pouch of tuna, used 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 Miracle Whip, and served the salad on thinly sliced (crosswise) French baguette bread. It made 2 nice dinner portions. YUM, YUM.

I have made a recipe substituting the celery with chopped green pepper and tomato and substituting the lemon juice with lime juice and may be served in hard taco shells.

It's light on the mayo, which is how I like my tuna salad. I wasn't sure if I'd like the crunchiness of the veggies, but I was sure to chop them finely, and it provided just enough texture. Delightful.
