I liked it - but I wouldn't serve with turkey for thanksgiving. This went well with beef brisked and pork from the smoker. great kick

I like better the roasted beets on the top of a mixture of yogurt or sore cream with mayo, apple and nuts. Try it! It's tasteful!!

I made this two days before and let mellow until thanksgiving...some of us loved it and some really didn't due to vinegary taste. I doubled the horseradish. Next time I will triple the horseradish, and halve the vinegar.

The over-riding taste was "pickling"

I made this relish for Thanksgiving and was the only one to touch it. The prep is easy, even roasting the beets, and the dish is easy to assemble but the appearance and taste left much to be desired. The color was rich but so rich that it looked fake. The red from the beets bled into the apples and the combination of the red flesh and the green skin of the Granny Smiths looked odd. The taste was too "pickled" and added no depth to the meal or combined with the turkey. Unfortunately this did not make it to the left over list and was simply tossed into the trash. If you want a colorful relish to accompany your Christmas ham then give this recipe a try. But have a back up side dish or relish just in case.
