Very delicious. The combination brought refreshing flavor to the bison meat. Easy to pull together and quick to cook. We didn't use Ranch dressing and, although it would have been a nice accompaniment, it didn't detract from the burger.

My family and I LOVED this recipe. Terrific bright notes with a slight bite from the jalapeno and a wonderful citrus edge. Definitely a recipe for once a week if you're a beef eater. Remember - choose beef without pink slime!
