Made this twice and it's fabulous. It's so good it can be eaten on its own. The first time I used whipping cream but turns out I didn't have enough so it was more like chocolate sauce but it tasted sooo good. So I chilled it and then poured it over the cake, and served it with more sauce on the side. Mascarpone cheese is also an excellent substitute for whipping cream, I used it the second time, and the consistency was just right. I melted the chocolate chips and added 2-3 Tbsp espresso.

I made this frosting to put on top of gingerbread cookies and it complimented them perfectly! It's very light in texture and the flavor is delicious. I agree with reviews that say it reminds one of chocolate mousse.

this is an excellent frosting. It was light, fluffy, not too sweet and not too chocolaty. Just right! I omitted the chips and placed one chip on the top of the cupcakes that I used this frosting for.

This was ok. Had too much of a cocoa-powder flavor for my taste. Will not make again.

made this without the chips. when i first made this i found it had an odd 'raw cocoa' sort of flavour, not bad, just not that good. but i had some left over and after a couple days in the fridge that went away and it was really quite good. probably most suitable for a simple sheet cake frosting.

Very nice frosting. I made it for an ice cream cake and worked out perfectly!

Made this frosting with the Chocolate fudge cake from this site and it was perfect. Very easy and not too sweet.

Very light and delicious and, obviously, easy to make. I beat it just a wee bit too long so it was a tad too stiff, but I know it was my mistake, nothing to do with the recipe itself. I used it to top the wonderful Chocolate Fudge Cake recipe on this site. Mmmmmm! Agree with other reviewers that the chips aren't essential, but can promise you're kids will love 'em.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever made and eaten...for as basic as it was. I used Valrhona chocolate! Heaven. My only problem was that the cake stuck to the wire rack when cooling and so I lost a layer. Next time I'll probably keep it a 2 layer cakee instead of 4.

I made this to top devils food cupcakes and it was wonderful. I left out the chocolate chips as one reviewer did and it tasted just like chocolate mousse. I'd never made mousse before and upon tasting it I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I brought the cupcakes to a church function and was told the frosting could've stood on its own as a dessert. I will definitely make it again, maybe as a mousse inside chocolate bowls.

I tried it without the chocolate chips and am so glad-it is fantastic. Tastes like a nice, light chocolate mousse. I think the chips would detract from the light and smooth quality of the frosting. Everyone really liked it.

i, too, thought the mini chocolate chips would add an unpleasant texture to the frosting. i was tempted to leave them out....but i was WRONG. this frosting was very, very, VERY good. DON'T CHANGE A THING!! it complemented the cake perfectly. i was almost tempted to lick the bowl!

Very tasty and rich, but not too sweet. And this coming from the person who normally scrapes the frosting off her cake. It tastes a bit like chocolate mousse, which I love, and the chocolate chips are a very nice finishing touch.

This is an excellent frosting. I used it for a different cake, and used much fewer chips than recommended -- just a handful was a nice touch, so that you got two or three in every bite, sandwiched between the cake layers.

This is an absolutely delicious icing. It got rave reviews from all my co-workers. We usually find icing on chocoate cake too sweet but not with this one. Have already made it several times!!!

Excellent!!! I don't have an electric mixer, so manual whipping takes a bit more effort, but is also a good workout! Top with strawberries or other fruit!
