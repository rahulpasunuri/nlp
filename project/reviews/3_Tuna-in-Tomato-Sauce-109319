We all thought this was delicious. I was late getting to the fish store and they only had 3/4 lb of tuna so I added some shrimp and it was quite good. Served over Basmati rice.

Excellent quick, simple dish, made with staples around the kitchen. I would definitely serve it to a guest for a nice casual meal -- pair with some wine, salad, etc.

a very quick, simple, and tasty way to cook tuna. This will become a weeknight staple at my house. Not fare to impress company, but a good substantial, healthy meal.

Good alternative to tuna salad, grilled tuna, etc.

This was a great alternative to my regular grilled tuna! A little fresh thyme and ground pepper added a nice touch. Served over basmati rice. Definitely recommended.

Unfortunately, we can't get fresh tuna so, may everyone forgive me, I used tinned and added extra virgin olive oil, chopped black olives and capers and we couldn't believe how good it was. And fast! This is a keeper.

I liked this dish. Really liked it. My husband was less enthusiastic but I would still make it again, exactly as written. I had to turn the pieces over to insure that no "pink" was visible on the surface of the fish, and then let it stand a few minutes longer. I think this would work well with swordfish too.
