These were fantastic - a perfect hit of sweet and salt.

Every one loves this cookie! I substituted 1/3 of the butter with virgin coconut oil which is solid at room temp. This added more coconut flavor. I also substituted 1/3 of the sugar with raw large-granule sugar which adds a nice crunch. Did not refrigerate but rolled dough into small balls and flattened with my thumb. Baked about 16 min. Worked great. Enjoy!

These cookies are delicious - made them for a cuban dinner and served with vanilla ice cream and diced mango. The coconut is subtle which is why they are so good - EVERYBODY loved these! I did not roll out and cut the dough with cookie cutter, rather I formed the dough into a log, chilled and sliced off pieces as you would refrigerator cookies - the dough is very soft so this works very well if well-chilled.

Ok - but only OK. Frankly it's hard to make shortbread and not have it be basically tasty. But the coconut flavor was way too light for us. Adding 1/2 - 1 tsp of coconut extract might work. Also, in my oven, the coconut only took 3 minutes to toast and the cookies only took 10 minutes to bake.

This recipe was a waste of ingredients for me. The cookies fall apart when you touch them. I did sub. sweetened coconut for unsweetened because that's what I had, and dialed back sugar a few tablespoons but I don't think that's what did it. Just not impressive at all. Not enough coconut flavor but I did like the delicate coconut crunch.

LOVED this recipe. It's one of the best cookies I've made in a long time and they were extremely addictive. The texture is a perfect crisp shortbread. I would highly recommend these to any coconut (or shortbread) fan.

Very easy to make! I had a few little changes - used one stick of salted butter, sweetened coconut, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Baked 21 minutes. This is a keeper! I LOVE this cookie!

I omitted Vanilla and added almond oil instead. I also added coconut powder in addition to the toasted fresh coconut. Thank you for this recipe. Simple, easy, and also a great base for custard tarts. Try it today with mango or lemon/ almond!

Delicious cookies! I couldn't find unsweetened coconut, so I used sweetened. I roasted the coconut for the full 8 minutes, and used only 1 C of sugar (omitted the 1TB sugar). They tasted great; not too sweet. I also didn't roll them out and cut with cookies cutters because I only needed the cookies for the tropical cheesecake crust. I saved half the dough in the freezer to make another time. I rolled the remaining dough into little balls and flattened with a fork so they were pretty thin. Baked for 18-19 minutes, and they are perfect!

Super yum! I wanted just a plate of cookies to serve with fresh lime ice cream and grilled pineapple, so I halved the formula, pressed the dough into an 8-inch Pyrex pan, baked until it was barely brown, and before it cooled entirely cut it into 32 pieces. Oh, and added 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract along with the vanilla. Didn't bother to chill, and they turned out perfect. This is a great cookie to go along with tropical fruit desserts.

Wasted a cup of coconut, 8 minutes was far too long in my oven for toasting it. 6 minutes was a little over-toasted, next time I'll try 5. I cooked the first batch for 20 minutes, and they were too brown. While they were baking, I had a second cookie sheet with raw cookies on it in the fridge, and cooked it for 17 minutes. Those cookies came out perfect.

This is the absolute best use of flour sugar cocnut and butter I have ever tasted. THe only problem with this recipe is that you can literally eat the entire plate of cookies. It can be disturbing.... :) But seriously, these are excellent. A couple of points: dont use the cuisenart to mix the dough- do it by hand, they turn out much better. Also- I refrigerated the dough in a log, and sliced off rounds then back into the freezer for a few minutes to firm up before popping them back in the oven. I am working on a chocolate version with cocoa powder since my hubby likes anything chocolate. Also, these would be excellent with half dipped in chocolate. But these are unbelievable! Keep some dough in the freezer for quickie baked goods to bring to neighbors (or a late night craving!)

These cookies are absolutely delicious. I only made 2/3 a batch and I still had more than enough for the banana-cream parfaits that these are part of. Here are the variations I made: I used european butter, organic sugar, and part whole-wheat pastry flour. Instead of rolling out the dough, I just used a warm cookie stamp to flatten out 1 inch balls. Much easier!
