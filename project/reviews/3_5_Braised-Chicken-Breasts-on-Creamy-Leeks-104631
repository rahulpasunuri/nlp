Fabulous! The flavor in the sauce is not to be believed. If I had this in a fine restaurant, I'd be thinking...." what did they do to get this amazing flavor...?" I made it like the recipe, but added fresh thyme before the broth was added and when served, sprinkled with fresh chopped parsley and chives. It was really amazing. My dinner guest has rated this as "spectacular".

This was a perfect, easy weeknight meal. I improvised based on what I had - Marsala wine, whole milk with flour, added peas and corn and chopped cabbage. It was savory, warm and very flavorful. We served it over egg noodles.

I made this recipe last night. It was a fork dropper (the good kind). I did make some of the suggested changes to give more flavor (garlic and onions mixed in with the leeks) and seasoned the chicken (thyme). This one will definitely go into heavy rotation.

The creamy leeks were rich and delicious, but they couldn't save the chicken breasts from being extremely boring. In the future, I might prepare the leeks as a side for a mild white fish.

I thought this was very good. I actually used Brussels sprouts instead of leeks since I had them on hand. My husband loved the sprouts and said he preferred them to leeks, so I'll be making it again for sure. It's a nice easy weeknight meal. Goes well with a good piece of crusty bread!

Rating: 4
I made it as written and thought it was awesome. It's pretty quick for a weeknight dinner and it had great 'comfort' flavor. I actually thought it tasted like a white cheese sauce. Regardless, this is a keeper for a weeknight dinner, no doubt. Tomorrow I'm making it again except with some double-thick pork chops. Exceptional.

Made this on the weekend but added garlic and herbes de provence to the leeks. Poured the cream sauce over broccoli and whipped potatoes and I think my lady friend fell in love with me. Its a rich and heavy combination so smaller portions with a good pinot grigio lead to - you know. Loved it.

We made this last night and while it's a solid dish, it's fairly dull. I love leeks and they were a nice base but nonetheless, we were underwhelmed. Per some of the reviews, we added garlic, and I subbed brandy for white wine as I thought it'd be nice with the cream.

Rating: 3
I made a few variations as well - but really enjoyed this recipe as a base. As mentioned earlier I added Fresh Garlic (at the same time as the Leeks) and Fresh Tomatoes at the end. However, I also added a few leaves of Fresh Basil. Instead of Dry White Wine (which we did not have in the house!) I used a Riesling and a bit of Brandy.

Rating: 3
Lovely technique just perfect for "cleaning out the fridge". Used leeks, leftover endives and (gasp) Boston lettuce added at the last moments of braising. No tomatoes on hand so threw in some julienned carrots as well for colur and texture change. Subbed leftover champagne for white wine and would love to try this with sherry as suggested earlier. How I'm out of sherry is beyond me.Really what kind of guests drink up all your sherry but leave you w/ a 1/4 bottle of champagne?! :D Used on sale chicken quarters that I deboned myself both drumsticks and thighs ( the bones went into the nearby stockpot;)) Serving with leftover broccoli and white rice. This is a keeper on many a level.

Read the previous reviews and: I halved the chicken (we are only two) but kept the sauce the same...also used chicken thighs as that is what I had on hand. I added two very large cloves of finely chopped garlic, used light 1/2 & 1/2 with a tablespoon of flour, added the tomato right before taking it off the heat and a sprinkling of Italian parsley to add color at the end...like the other reviewer, my husband actually licked the plate. He raved about it after dinner and made me wish I had doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers. A wonder, quick and delightful recipe.

This is superb, and is immediately going into my favorite recipe file. I suggest replacing the wine with dry sherry. I also just used water and a small amount of herbs (sage & rosemary) in place of the broth, because I was out of broth. Outstanding.

an Excellent weeknight meal. Threw a few past-their-prime cherry tomatoes and some pressed garlic in with the leeks. Some crushed red pepper may have made this even better - will try next time. Served with mini-farfalle. Without the color from the tomatoes it would have been a very blonde meal. Definitely add some red pepper strips or something bright green to jazz up the visual appeal.

Made this this evening after getting fresh leeks at the farmers market. it was delicious. We did add red pepper with the leeks and two small cloves of garlic just before the leeks. Quick and fairly easy. This will be a regular when I can find fresh leeks.

Made this last night, my wife and daughter loved it. Added 1/2 diced pepper and 1/4 diced jalapeno with the leeks, then a diced tomato at the end. You could probably add any vegetables, herbs or spices to the leeks to suit your preferences.

My adjustments were to add a chopped fresh tomato right at the end for color and brightness of taste and swap the cream for half&half. The tomato addition turns out to be KEY! Really good dish that's sure to please.

Made this again but with amendments and it came out exceptional! I used olive oil and no butter to start with. Added more wine and double the cream at the end. I used a chicken stock cube disolved in a bit of water so it had more of a concentrated taste, which came out really well. LOVELY! But prob bad for you with the amount of cream so maybe do it once a year, like me! :P

Rating: 4
I made with 1 lb leeks and 1 lb bok choy (that's wot I had in the fridge), olive oil instead of butter (never use it). I overspilled the oil but wasn't oily in the end. My sauce didn't really thickened but who cares? Tasty and easy to make. Will make again. I also used goat's double cream so my dinner was detox. That's void of toxins not calories!

Rating: 3
Here's a solution for those that found the recipe bland: Seasoning the chicken with dry marjoram. Before adding the leeks, saute some chopped garlic. Right when you're about to add back the chicken, also add chopped fresh basil, thyme, rosemary, and oregano! Now tell me this is bland! :) Oh, I made this recipe as written, except scaled the serving to one. ALL MINE!! Mmmm

This is fantastic. Very simple and incredibly delicious results. I added garlic like another poster suggested and used Savignon Blanc wine, since it was what I had available in the house. My husband and I were literally licking our plates clean. I had halved the recipe, since it is only the two of us but wished I'd made the whole recipe just for the sauce alone. While it made enough for the chicken, next time we'd like to have extra to pour over our side dish. The depth of flavor from such simple ingredients is really mind blowing in this recipe. It would make a great dish to serve for company and I definitly will but this into my rotation of home menus. Love it!

This is a nice simple dish that is quick to make. My wife was craving leeks (we had scallops with melted leeks a few days ago.... 4 stars) so I tried this recipe. I admit to adding a few cloves of chopped up garlic with the leeks. I always add garlic unless it seems destructive. Plus, as I was stirring the cream into the leeks at the end, it seemed to cry out for some chopped fresh tarragon, so I tossed some in. People were litterally licking their plates. It was great, and simple, and relatively healthy. This dish is in the regular rotation now. I'm tempted to toss some diced tomatoes into the sauce also. I'll report back if/when I try it.

This was fabulous! What I did (mostly other people's suggestions, so thank you, all): add fresh thyme while sauteeing chicken breasts (3); add 1 large clove garlic and 1 medium shallot while cooking leeks. Everything else according to recipe, served over rotini. Plenty of sauce. I cook from this site several times a week, but this is only the second time I've been inspired to write a review. We loved it.

I thought this was great for an everyday meal... I used sour cream instead of heavy cream because that's what I happened to have (of course I didn't boil it at the end) and I really liked it that way... I also added a little fresh chopped parsley at the end. You might want to try slicing the chicken before you plate it so you have maximum surface area for the sauce. I'd definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Very nice weeknight dish. Since I don't like runny cream sauces, I took about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the sauce with the leeks and put it through an immersion blender. I then added the blended sauce back into the rest of the sauce. This intensified the flavor and thickened the sauce just enough. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 2
Not bad, not great. The chicken was a bit boring as it didn't soak up much flavor. The leaks were very tasty (when is cream sauce not?), but next time I think I'll try stuffing the chicken breasts as suggested by another review. It is fast to make, and only uses one pan... so still a decent weeknight item.

This one is a keeper! I make it an average of 2-3 times a month. Always with great results. Definitely make sure you have enough bread on hand for sopping up all the liquid. In reference to the reviewers who question what type of pan to use I always use my Le Creuset dutch oven. It heats evenly, browns the meat, and braises extremely well.

This was very very good - I am quite pleased. Sure - the non stick pan did not allow for many brown leftover bits. However - the butter used in the nonstick pan helped brown the chicken.

Ignore the 1 fork because I haven't made this recipe - but I think using a nonstick skillet looks like a mistake. The chicken won't brown and you shouldn't have any brown bits to deglaze with the wine if the nonstick skillet is doing it's job. This looks like a perfect dish for a regular skillet!

I have made this several times and have found that the strength of flavor in the leeks varies greatly. I have yet to figure out how to determine how flavorful they are BEFORE I've made the recipie. When the leeks are strong the dish is creamy, a bit on the sweet side, a tad onion-y and loved by my family. If the leeks are weak it's a bland soupy dish that my family didn't recognize. Wonderful - if the leeks are optimumly flavorful.

I've made this dish a few times now and find it exceptionally easy for the good flavor I get. It's on the rich side, but that can be a nice treat once in a while.

This is pleasant, not spectacular. I did add garlic as previous reviewers suggested, and agree it was needed. I think this dish needs a little something extra to give it a fuller flavor.

Can I make that four forks and a bottle of dry white wine? This was an especially good chicken recipe. I did need to make a substitution since my boyfriend has a thing for pepper blends. Instead of regular black pepper we used a freshly ground blend of five kinds of spices(black, white, pink peppers, allspice, and coriander- available at Wal-mart of all places), which pepped it up a bit more (no pun intended). This was beloved by all my guests.

I thought this recipe was a good basis for experimentation. Adding a dash of cayenne pepper (as suggested) was a must.

This was SO GOOD. I too, doubled the sauce. I think I always tend to double the sauce (if anyone ever tries Chicken Louisa on this site, 1. It's absolutely unbelievable, 2. You MUST double the sauce). My boyfriend wanted a side dish and a side veg so I quickly made up some Uncle Ben's Fine Herb Risotto (pretty darn good for a boxed risotto) and sauteed some fresh spinach with butter, garlic, and essence seasoning (Emeril, of course). Of course, I made way too much food for the two of us so I brought the leftovers to work for lunch the next day and it was even better! I heated it up in the mic and half my department came over to see what delicious lunch I was having! Gave the recipe out to several people based ONLY on the smell.

I had never cooked with leeks before, but I asked a woman at a local farmstand last weekend for some helpful hints, and then found this recipe...WOW! Absolutely wonderful flavor, and very easy to make. I cut the recipe back to only make two servings, but kept the sauce ingredients the same, so I agree with everyone else saying "double the sauce." :-) I also added a good sprinkle of ground nutmeg when I stirred in the heavy cream. Gave it a nice flavor. Served everything over rice - the sauce is wonderful and this is a definite keeper recipe to make again!

I haven't made chicken breast dishes in a long time because I just got tired of the sameness of it all. But this dish interested me, and I'm so glad I tried it. It was truly delicious, and easy--what a combination. I also doubled the sauce and am glad I did. I've also never cooked leeks before and was a little apprehensive, but for no reason.

Had all of the ingredients and decided this would be a great recipe for the chicken breast I wanted to cook. Based on the reviews I figured I couldn't miss and my assumption was correct. The only thing I would change next time would be the manner in which the chicken is final cooked. The results were very good, but we like are chicken just cooked and still soft and juicy. Mine was a little more done than we prefer. Perhaps cooking covered for 5 minutes and uncovering for the final preparation so the chicken can be removed just as it has completed cooking. This is really a good recipe and very tasty.
