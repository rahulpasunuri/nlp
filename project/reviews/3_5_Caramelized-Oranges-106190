lovely dessert with a Middle Eastern or Indian dinner. Even better i you add a good sprinkle of chopped, toasted pistachios.

Great dessert! Very simple to make and wonderful served exactly as suggested, but I'm excited about all of the possible variations I can experiment with. Next time, I will add a vanilla bean to the syrup and dust the oranges with a tiny bit of cinnamon. A dark chocolate dipped biscotti would be an excellent accompaniment if serving these with coffee. I actually just peeled my oranges really well instead of using a knife to remove the peel and then sliced each orange into three rounds which had them hold together in the frying pan and at service. This eliminates the problem of an "ugly" presentation.

Tasty and not very fattening, but it didn't come out looking that attractive. I served it over low fat vanilla ice cream and no one cared how it looked since it tasted so good.

Tasty and simple. A little hard to eat since the orange slices are so big. Serve it with a fork and knife on a plate. Works fine if you substitute store-bought orange juice for the fresh squeezed. Also easy to cut the recipe in half.

Absolutely delicious! A nice change of pace from the usual calorie- and fat-laden desserts.
