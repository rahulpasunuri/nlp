This pie was great - nice and simple, fairly low on sugar, and very apple pie-y! As another reviewer suggested, I used applesauce instead of juice. I mixed it with the cornstarch first, then added the other ingredients. I also added cinnamon to the pie filling itself. It came out great! One friend said it was the best apple pie she'd ever had!

Wow! This was the best apple pie I've ever had. My husband and kids devoured it. I used Gala apples and had no problem with runniness. I added two more apples than called for, just to fill the pie, without adding additional liquid and it worked great. Also, I tossed the apples with some cinnamon for a bit more flavor.

don't fill apples over edge of pie pan or they end up too dry.

I just made this recipe for my office to nothing but rave reviews! I took others' advice and sprinkled Cinnamon and sugar on the crust. Also, to keep it from getting too runny, instead of using apple juice, I used one of those kiddy cups of applesauce (with cinnamon), and it worked like a dream.

This recipe has been deemed "the best apple pie ever" in my circle of friends. Here is my twist, which adds more of an apple pie spice flavor and will never produce a runny pie (you can cut it after 30 min, and it will not run). Use the Pilsbury refrigerated pie crust(why re-invent the wheel?). Cut peeled apples into 1/8 inch slices. Size is important. Make a surrey with 2T apple juice and the corn starch; coat apples. Combine other ingredients and then mix in apples (will look clumpy-no worries). Use a slotted spoon to deliver apples into bottom crust. Discard remaining liquid. Coat top with a mixture of brown sugar and apple pie spices, put top crust on pie. Brush with a sugar egg wash. Make sure to use the baking directions on the pie crust box.

I love the full-blast apple flavor of this. The variety of apple makes a huge difference in how watery it is - for regular apples I think it would benefit from additional cornstarch. Cooking time varies wildly as well, so check it by poking at the apples to see when they're done.

I made this as directed and it was still watery. the flavor was good, not too sweet, which I liked. but it didn't taste like standard apple pie.

I just made this again and for some reason - it was a bit soupy even after sitting in the refrigerator over night. I thought it would congeal, like it had before, but it was really watery. And I followed the instructions exactly. Should I add an extra tsp of cornstarch next time?

super easy and yummy! I saute the apples with half the butter first because I like them to be softer. I also add a little vanilla, cinnamon to the mixture and once I added some raspberries. It always turns out great.

Loved it. I added vanilla extract and cinnamon to the filling. Also used cinnamon and sugar on top crust. A simple winner!

Easy and quick. I make it when I have people over for dinner. You can time it so by the end of dinner it will still be warm enough to top off `a la mode.

FABULOUS!!! I have been using this recipe now for two years and it just gets better every time! I suggest you add a hint of vanilla in the recipe and a dash of cinnamon before you cook it. You will adore this recipe!

I didn't have any apple juice, so I used fresh squeezed from my last Cameo apple. This recipe made for a very pretty pie, but I found it to be too tart. Next time I'm going to try mixing in half gala or cameo apples. But my Mom loved it. She said it was the best she had every eaten. And everyone else ate it with lots of ice cream and didn't complain.

i made this pie for the fourth time for one of my coworkers- of course the rest of the office caught wind of it and i've had to email the recipe to everyone. This time I even added a cinnamon crumb crust that i found in another recipe and it was INCREDIBLE...i cant stop eating it.

Easy to make, great consistency and fresh flavor. I make my own crust and fill it with this recipe. If I'm feeling decadent I leave out 2 tablespoons of the apple juice and add 2 tablespoons of cointreau. But it's a great recipe as written.

This is such a great recipe. This was my first pie ever made, I made it for Christmas lunch at our house. It was such a hit.

Truly, this was very easy to make & pretty too - but more importantly it was very tasty. I used apple cider and granny smith apples. I made it a day ahead and refrigerated it. I took it to a friends for Thanksgiving, there wasn't even one piece left to bring home. Next year I'm making two pies!

this was awesome!!! i've never made a pie in my life- except pumpkin pie from the can- it was soooo easy- and sooooo good...and it makes it even ten times better that its not as high in fat and sugar as other pies are...yum yum!! i made this last night, ahead of time to make sure that it would be a good one for thanksgiving...and i'm gonna have to make another one now because it already half gone.

This was my first apple pie ever so I was a bit nervous after reading the reviews of several recipes and hearing that they turned out like soup! It was delicious, super easy and my husband loved it. I used gala apples for this recipe and I didn't have apple juice but i had cider. It was a little juicy when we first cut it but after it sat overnight it congealed nicely. I will definitely make this again. And I am making it for Thanksgiving this week.

I made this over the weekend and it was fantastic! My husband loved it and will be making it again and again. The only change I made was that the grocery store did not have just plain cider, so I used cider with caramel and it was great!

This recipe tasted great (especially served with a little bit of whipped cream) BUT it was a little messy. It cooked up beautifully but ended up looking really messy once I cut into it. it didn't look like a piece of pie on the plate...but it sure tasted like one.

This is my classic apple pie recipe. I've made this several times using freshly squeezed apple juice and Northern Spies apples straight off the trees. Every body likes this pie and it's very easy to make too.

Added rum soaked golden raisins and some of the rum instead of the apple juice. Could cut back to ~ 2 Tbsp butter. Made into an open free-form pie with edges folded over about an inch. Only one crust. Was superb.

I haven't yet tried this recipe but will be tonight and am wondering if the pie freezes well. We have a lot of apples to use so I would like to make lots of pies and stick them in the freezer for when company comes over. Thanks!

My first home made pie! Yummy & easy. I would also add an additional apple. Hubby loved it.

This is a simple marvelous recipe. I shared the pie with two of my close friends who aren't big fans of apple pies, and both of them were raving! Wonderful texture, great ingredients, and easy to make too! (Just a side note, don't forget to add the cornstarch until after the pie is in the oven. I had quite a time peeling the crust off and mixing the cornstarch in. ) I think its a sign of a great recipe when you mess it up a bit, and it still turns out fabulous!

I forgot to mention that I am diabetic so I substituted splenda for the brown sugar. It worked beautifully.

I would most certainly make this again. However, I will double the apples, and other ingredients to have a bigger pie. It was WONDERFUL

i prefer a thinner crust, so i roll out the store bought crusts a bit more. i also rub a mixed egg + some sugar, over the crust, before baking. i think it makes for a nicer presentation.

Delicious! Best apple pie I've ever had. Love the fresh apple goodness - I used Granny Smith and couldn't imagine not using them. It came out perfectly the first time and everyone loved it. I am sending it to friends and suggesting it to them as well.

This recipe is open for additions. A simple recipe with room for growth. Easy in the kithen and easy on the waist line. Adding spices and rasins or cherry is just as easy. Send it to friends and family they, will thank you

It was okay. The apples were a little crunchy for my taste (even when I baked it for longer than the recipe suggested) When I make it again, I would use less apples (4) and use a different kind, like Rome or McIntosh apples.

Very easy to make! I added spices (cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg) to the apple mixture which worked well. Would make again.

Easy and delicious, but needed some changes. The four fork rating is with the following changes: 1/3 cup pineapple apple orange juice (instead of apple juice) 2/3 cup brown sugar (packed), 5 Tbsp unsalted butter, 5 apples, 2 1/2 tbsp cornstarch, pie crusts (as listed), 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. This increased the depth of flavor. With changes, will definitely make again!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out great. I vote for the Granny Smith apples, and make sure to use 100% apple juice (like Juicy Juice) with no sugar added. Guests came back for seconds and it was gone before I had a second piece!

This is the first apple pie recipe I have ever tried and it tasted great. Very easy to make, too. A must for Thanksgiving.

This pie is so easy and it came out perfectly the first time. I'm planning to make it again for Thanksgiving. I made very slight modifications: instead of cutting the second frozen pie crust into strips, I put the whole crust on top and pinched closed at edges, cutting slits to ventilate. I used Smart Balance spread instead of light butter. I added a little more cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and a dash of vanilla extract to the apple mixture, and I used a variety of good baking apples (Northern Spy, Gala, Granny Smith). I definitely recommend this recipe for a quick and delicious pie, especially to those short on time or first-time bakers!

Best pie recipe I've found to date. This was even better than the laborious deep-dish caramel apple pie on this site! It's also so much healthier...which makes all of my diners even more appreciative!! Lovely:)

easiest recipie ever, esp with the store bought crusts. everyone who tried it couldnt believe i made it. i used gala apples and actually ended up using 5 and 1/2 because i found they sank so much and added 1/8 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cinn for a great subtle flavor. also i didt even need the apple juice, made the crust a bit soggy.

This recipe was very easy to make, especially using store-bought crusts. I personally like lots of cinnamon in apple pie, so I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon in with the apple mixture. I also sprinkled the cinnamon on top of the crust per the recipe. It turned out great.

Very good. You taste the apples (use large galas if possible) and not all the sugar. Plus, this pie is not gooey where everything falls apart! It is easy to make and perfect!

I made this pie ahead for Thanksgiving and froze it. Then I cooked it day of and it was terrific. Even though it has less sugar, which was great for my diabetic father-in-law, it certainly didn't taste that way. On the contrary, it tasted extremely fresh. I commented to my husband that it tasted like a dessert you might have any night of the week (as opposed to a overly gooey dessert saved for special occassions).

This recipe is excellent! I love how it doesn't use alot of sugar so the apple pie isn't very sweet. It's so easy to make and so delicious.
