Don't make this dish if you have a house full of finicky eaters! Save this one for your upscale friends. I made it at Thanksgiving (as something different) and only a few people even tried it. It was VERY flavorful (in my opinion)

WOW! This is like drinking 2 shots of tequila. The pears are extremely strong - the tequila flavor is overwhelming, completely obscuring any pear taste. However, the raspberry sauce is _fantastic_. I will make the sauce again, but to serve with pears poached in something else. (It gives a beautiful and impressive presentation.) I served this with the lemon cookies as suggested and that was a must to help cut the tequila flavor.

I made this for friends and we couldn't get enough. It made a beautiful display and tasted great.
