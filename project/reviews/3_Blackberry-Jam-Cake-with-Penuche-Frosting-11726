Used a 9 in. round pan. It cooked all the way through in 45 min but was only about an inch thick. In a pinch had to sub plain full fat yogurt for the buttermilk. Skipped the penuche frosting and made with cream cheese frosting instead. Very nice.

You have solved a mystery!! My grandmother used to make this cake for years but sadly 10 yrs ago she stopped when she finally passed away her recipe book mysteriously disappeared. I have searched so long for this Thank you for having this great recipe.!!! A little tip to cut down on the richness try a thin slice served with fresh Homemade Custard. Its to die for!!!

Tasty and moist. However, center was still wet after cooking time. Took out anyway, and this was the best part of the cake. Frosting was a nightmare and too sweet. Hardens/crumbles on the spot.
