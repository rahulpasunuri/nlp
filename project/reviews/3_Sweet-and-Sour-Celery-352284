I thought this would be more like a chutney, but it tasted pretty much like steamed celery. The liquid is mostly water; the other stuff doesn't impart much flavor. Four pounds of celery is enough to feed an army. If I were to make this again, I'd try less water and less celery so that the flavoring came through more. Ultimately, I don't think it's worth the effort, however.

I had high expectations for this dish and they were not met. I would not recommend it.

Simply tasty and easy to do. I don't get how the parchment paper "lid" works and will next time use a grease splatter screen with the paper to allow out steam. *Takes a long while for liquid to reduce - be patient, results are good. *Served alongside fish; delicate in flavor, but looks pale on the finish.

I made this with swiss chard stems instead of celery and it was delicous. This is our favortite recipe for chard stems yet. I'll be making this often.

This is one of those dishes that's great for using up produce. It would be a good side dish for a vegetarian meal (we had it with grilled steak) but, let's face it - it's still celery. I'd make it again but maybe would add some carrots in as well.

This was amazing. I used half the recommended amount of celery but the same amount of liquid. It did not reduce as much as the recipe said it would, but I wouldn't change a thing. The leftover liquid is ideal for poaching fish; in fact, the taste reminds me of a medieval sweet and sour fish recipe I have made. Even people who don't think you can eat celery as a stand alone vegetable might change their minds after trying this.

I really liked this recipe. I served it with a classic cheese souffle and it was delicious together. There is so many times I buy a head of celery for 1 or 2 stalks and then want to use the rest before it goes bad and this recipe lets me use celery in a delicious and special way.
