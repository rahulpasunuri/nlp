I'm sure this "recipe" would taste delicious after several bottles of wine at the end of your dinner party (or after smoking a little herbal indulgence). BUT-- Since when do "frozen strawberries in heavy syrup" constitute a sauce on Epicurious? I thought this site was about the joy and awesomeness of cooking, not about how to thaw processed crap...

Easy and excellant. Used fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce(in seaseon) didn't bother with the fine sieve.

I was looking for something fun to make with all the rhubarb I have. This was perfect! I made enough for 24 people and everyone loved it.

Great! Everyone I could convince to try rhubarb loved it. And it is pretty as well. Make sure to let everything cool, as it can get a bit runny.

The roasted rhubarb by itself was a little strange conceptually (as I'd never done it before), but combined with the other complementary sauces, it was terrific. I used Mexican agria crema instead of the creme fraiche, and it was quite yummy.

I didn't read the directions correctly and ended up mixing the strawberry and cream sauces, but it was excellent nonetheless. The only problem was that we should have made twice as many so everyone could have seconds! The leftover sauce is great as a milkshake base as well.

For an elegant dinner party dessert, double the filling and instead of using puff pastry make baskets (using the bottom of a custard cup to shape) from phyllo dough. Garnish with fresh strawberries and mint leaves. An advantage is that it can all be made ahead of time. And it's wonderful at Easter.

These are just luscious and so easy to make. Such a nice spring dessert.
