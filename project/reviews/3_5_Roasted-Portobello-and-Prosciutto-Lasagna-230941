Followed the recipe exactly...and not very good. This is the first time that an Epicurious recipe has been an epic fail...the mushrooms have an odd texture and there's a nasty aftertaste. Don't recommend.

Delicious as is but be warned, it is very rich. I made this a second time recently for a large gathering as a side dish. Since we had a few vegetarians on board, I substituted the prosciutto with leeks and the chicken broth with vegetable broth and I think it was even better!

I love this recipe but I shortened it up a bit by skipping roasting the mushrooms. I just cooked them on the stove. I also added peppers to the recipe the second time around. You can really add anything you want! I used wheat flower and it turned out just fine, not exactly the same color as the picture. so good you have to try it!

Great recipe. 2nd time through, I used Italian dressing on the mushrooms when roasting them, chopped them fine and added a couple cups of roasted red peppers. Lightens it up a bit, adds color.

This was really wonderful, I didn't have the right cheese so I used ricotta and parmesan and was super good. used a mix of crimini, button and portobello's too. Will make it again.

Come on people! This dish is not that time consuming to make! Pour yourself a glass of charddonay and enjoy the process. I cut the recipe in half for a dinner for 4. Served with a simple green salad. Wonderfully rich and yummy.

Wow. Can I just say wow??! I made this in the kitchen with my sister during the day, then we stuck it in the fridge and baked it when our company arrived in the evening. It was delicious and awesome to make ahead of time because that enabled us to actually converse and hang out with our guests. Phenomenal combination of prosciutto with the roasted portobelloes. It got rave reviews from everyone at the table.

Ok, it did take a while to assemble, but having it ready to pop in the oven made it perfect for entertaining. The flavors were fantastic - from the proscuitto to the portobello to the cheese - a great combo.

Delicious but not the cheapest ingredients, although it makes enough to last a while. We didn't have a large dish but instead used two smaller 8x10ish inch dishes and managed to fill them both. Also we used some leftover Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan for the sauce part, which worked pretty great. This is the first time we ever made lasagne and its one of the best recipes I've tasted!

This is one heck of a Lasagna! My husband won't eat mushrooms so I only make it when he's not around which is rare...but my friends always love to hear that it's lasagna night at my place. The prosciutto and portobellos make this such a unique dish. The creamy sauce makes it seem extra extravagant. I wish I could eat this every week. Absolutely exquisite dish!

I made this years ago. Loved it but swore never again!! Too much washing up! BUT...I just did it again and cut some corners this time. Still very good. Ignore first paragraph of instuctions. Don't bother chopping prosciutto. Fry shallots and herbs in large non-stick pan. Add sliced raw mushrooms. Cook until mushrooms are tender. Remove to bowl. Using same pan, saute slices of prosciutto until brown. Make sauce but don't put grated cheese in the sauce. Assemble lasagne, breaking up sheets of prosciutto into smaller pieces and sprinkling grated cheese on top of each sauce layer. Much easier...... I will make it again this way! Other substitutions: 1 tsp each of dried herbs instead of fresh. Used combination of portobello and (less expensive) button mushrooms. Used 1% milk instead of whole. No nutmeg. Didn't put additional butter on top of lasagne. It's already SO rich!

So rich! I couldn't eat more than a tiny piece. Took over 2 hrs and wasn't cheap. For the amount of gruyere in the sauce you cant even taste it, the sauce was bland. Save the gruyere, skip this one.

Rating: 4
For a vegetarian version, my partner suggested substituting chopped sun-dried tomato for the prosciutto. It was a great suggestion: the sund-dried tomato created the perfect texture balance for the roasted mushroom and a subtle saltiness without overwhelming the flavor. I will try the no-cook noodles, as I have yet to finesse the technique of boiling and drying the noodles without having them bunch up or stick together.

Rating: 4
Wow! I loved this even though it does take a lot of time to make. Definitely worth the effort. I added spinach at the last minute to the shallot and proscuitto mixture. I also added more thyme, rosemary, and a large garlic clove. Made on Monday, and put in the fridge for dinner on Tuesday, only took about 45 mins and then I broiled the top for a minute or two. Perfect! I can't wait for leftovers.

I made this for our annual holiday staff party and got many compliments. I used no-boil noodles to save time, and it worked out just fine. I didn't actually get to eat any myself, only got to taste a little of what was left in the pan at the end, but I heard it was delicious!

Fantastic! I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. I doubled the recipe and ended up with more sauce and noodles then I did filling. I would double the shallots that it calls for. I also added a layer of zucchini. Everyone loved it. I made my noodles from scratch and just added them into the pan without boiling and they came out just fine.

I added extra garlic and some Italian olives. I was WONDERFUL!!!

For my first time this took almost 3 hours just to prepare, but I don't cook a lot so I'm sure I'm slower than average! I made it the night before and refrigerated it so the next day I just put it in the oven. Perfect! I read all the suggestions in the reviews and ended up eliminating the prosciutto since I had a salad with pancetta to go with it. I used no-boil noodles which turned out perfect, a little al dente. I also used 1% milk to save some calories (although not much considering the 1 lb of Gruyere!). I also only used 1 lb of portobello but added about a dozen Gremini mushrooms for variety. My guests loved it and even took extra home with them to have the next day. It kept well even 3 days later.

Rating: 4
I made this tonight for dinner--it is over two hours start to finish so be prepared! I used Swiss instead of Gruyere (cheaper), and fat- free milk since that's what I had. It seemed to me that preparation could be simplified by making a standard white sauce and adding the stock and cheese--it would save dishes too. Add a little extra liquid if you use no-boil lasagna noodles. We'll be having this again, especially for company!

This recipe is delicious and as other reviewers have noted, a bit labor intensive but well worth the effort. I didn't use the prosciutto as I felt the mushrooms were "meaty" enough. I doubled the fresh herbs and added some minced garlic and my guests were impressed. Great make-ahead, one-dish meal that is elegant and sophisticated.

I made this for a BBQ and I, as well as the other guests, just thought it was ok. I followed the recipe exactly and it just seemed a bit bland to me. I'm among my friends as a very good cook, so I don't think that I did anything to mess it up. It was ok. Also, A LOT of work.

This is a very rich dish. It is certainly one worth making again altough it is not an everyday meal. I will use more of the mushrooms and little less prosciutto when I make this again. Even so, for a one dish meal, this will make a wonderful and tasty impression!!

This was so tasty, even better as leftovers! I used ham instead of prosciutto for cost, and it was still fabulous. I also bought sliced baby portobellos which saved on time and cost- they roasted up fine. I may up the amount of ham and mushrooms a bit next time, just because they are so good together. I will be making this again for sure (but maybe next time I will wait until the cheese is on sale).

This is a wonderful change from the traditional lasagna bolognese that I usually make. I've made this twice now and really liked it both times. I made some changes the second time following the previous reviewers advice about eliminating the butter on top...you really don't need it. The dish is very rich tasting without it. I used more parmesan than the recipe called for. I also added some garlic to the shallot and prosciutto mixture along with a 1/2 cup of white wine. Other than that I followed the recipe. I took it to our annual "Italian" tailgate and got many positive comments! I did double the recipe and it took every bit of two hours to bake.I will deefinitly make again!

The vegetarian version of this dish is absolutely wonderful! I've made it twice now to utter raves and requests for the recipe. I used a variety of mushrooms (mostly portobello) and left out the prosciutto. It is rich and not for those dieting, but so delicious!

Made this dish for my book club -- they raved. It was delicious -- quite rich. I roasted the portobellos but think you might be able to slice and saute them and it would turn out as well. Can't wait for an opportunity to make this again!

Definitely a winner. Would absolutely recommend following the tips from the reviews listed here. Less salt, more shallots, more herbs and more cheese. After introducing it to my family, I've already had two people tell me they're making it on Christmas eve.

Great alternative to traditional lasagna...time consuming though. You definitely do not need 2 1/2 lbs. of Portobello mushrooms.

I keep tweaking this recipe because everyone seems to love it. I've made it a few times now. I doubled up on the herbs and omitted the salt. The dish could get salty depending on the type of prosciutto that you use. Some are saltier than others. I use a lot more parmesan on the top than the recipe called for.

Rating: 3
This was a great dish to prepare in advance and then bake just before guests arrived. I wanted a meat-free dish, so I skipped the prosciutto and increased the shallots to 1 cup. I used no-cook noodles, prepped everything the night before and then baked it, covered, for an hour at 350, let it sit out of the oven for 30 minutes, then gave it 5 minutes under the broiler.

Rating: 4
Indulgent and delicious! As in the other review, you only need about 1 lb of mushrooms. Worth the $ and work!

Made this for a party of 75 people with an Italian theme. I did a trial run first and found that for the expense, the prosciutto wasn't worth it - could hardly taste it. So when I made it for the party I doubled the shallots - it was even better without the prosciutto! This dish got rave reviews from everyone there - such a great change from your standard red lasagna - and everyone wanted the recipe. This ones a real keeper - I quadrupled the recipe and it was still a cinch to make.

Made this for a luncheon for 6 in an 8x8 pan. Received raves from all. I followed advice from another and sliced portobellos thinner, used only 1 pound. Followed recipe for sauce exactly and it is fabulous. I baked it for an hour at 350. Roasted mushrooms and made sauce two days ahead, put it all together day before baking, using no-cook lasagna.

I followed the recipe according to directions. Don't get me wrong, it was very (very) good... rich....sublime...but not sure worth all those calories!!! A little piece went a long way. This is, by no ways, a cheap lasagna to make. The portobello mushrooms were $18.00 alone. As much as this lasagna was very good, I will make some adjustments for next time. The sauce makes a huge amount and was way too rich (1% milk would work fine). Plus I will cut down on the mushrooms, cut them thinner and make it more the "Italian" way. Use a 8" square pan, 5 - 6 layers of fresh noodles, little sauce and mushrooms in the middle, lots of cheese on top. The filling was excellent...the concept is good....it just needs some playing around with.

Thanks to another reviewer, I used toasted flour, 1% milk, and omitted all of the butter (including on top). I also used no-cook lasagne noodles. Can't wait to have the leftovers!wonder

I made this for my Christmas dinner buffet. It was very flavorful, and a lot of people liked it. I followed the recipe exactly - wouldn't change anything. It is rich and the flavors are strong, so I would recommend serving it with a simple green salad and some rolls. I think it was too much with the other food I served with the buffet - this needs to stand on it's own. IT is definatley a great thing to serve for a party - I made everything the day before and put it together the morning of the party - just threw it in the oven 1 1/2 hours before serving, and let it sit for 30 mintutes.

We made this lasagna, with significant modification, for Christmas Eve and loved it. Made the recipe as indicated except substituted smoked salmon and crab for the proscuitto, as we have a seafood tradition on Christmas Eve. This worked well and I would recommend it to those looking for a seafood lasagna recipe. We also have had the lasagna made with the proscuitto (friends served it to us)and that version is delicious as well.

I was looking for a way to use portobello mushrooms, as I love the flavor and texture of them. The first time I made this I was wowed. It is a new favorite lasagna for me. I made it again for a vegetarian friend and left out the Prosciutto and the flavor was still excellent, there was not too much difference. Everyone has raved about it and I will definately continue to make it.

I received rave reviews for this dish and many requests for the recipe. In order to save a little time I used Barilla no-cook lasagna noodles, which I soaked a little in warm water just because I was afraid the sauce would be insufficient to "cook" the noodles. I use these noodles in regular lasagna without soaking and I think the quality doesn't suffer (otherwise I wouldn't make lasagna as often as I do).

Rating: 4
This was awesome!!! It was time consuming, but what lasagna isn't? It is wonderful heated up day after too, and stays together like no other lasagne. I did not add the additional parm or butter on top, as I didn't think it needed it. And it didn't. The flavors are wonderful together!!!!

I don't know how someone could think this lasagna is bland. My husband and I thought it was delicious. To make the white sauce healthier, I used 1% milk, omitted the butter, and toasted the flour prior to adding the milk/stock mixture. Even with the recipe alterations, it tasted very rich. I would make this for company.

Utterly bland--the sauce had no depth or real flavor. It reminded me of the recipes using a cream of mushroom soup, except that those taste better. Wouldn't make it again--far too much effort for too little return. (And how is this "meatless"? Is proscuitto now a vegetable?)

As a portabella lover, this blend of smoky and rich flavors was outstanding! It was also a very simple recipe to follow and create. If I were to make any changes, I would reduce the prosciutto and increase the portabella and rosemary. Excellent!

I didn't use quite as much portobello, only about a pound. Used no cook lasagna noodles. Very rich and satisfying on a dreary night!
