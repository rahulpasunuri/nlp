I trim the crummy leaves from around the base, cut off only the yucky end of the stem (because it's all edible), and go along the top of the leaves with a pair of scissors to get the thorny tips off. I then drop them into a large pot, fill half-way with water, add a splash of olive oil to it, and about a teaspoon of dried tarragon leaves to the water. Nothing else. They are cooked on medium high for about 45 minutes, depending on the size, with the lid on. I save all the lemon and garlic and salt and whatever for the dipping sauce, which varies depending on my mood. This is a stupid recipe. Flour in the water? Why?

Artichokes are very SIMPLE to prepare and serve; hot or cold. In addition to cutting the pointed tips off and trimming the stem, I suggest you wash them thoroughly (I didn't the first time I made them...YUK)...they can be served with melted butter or lemon mayo too.. Why mess with a great simple vegie?

Here's the reason why I love this recipe: Once done, you can use the hollowed-out artichoke bottom as an edible sauce boat or a basket for scallops, other veggies . . . anything you want! If you just want to eat an artichoke, then just boil an artichoke. But if you want to have a little fun with the presentation, this recipe is right on and a real crowd-pleaser.

For Pete's sake! Just cut off the stem, the top, and trim the leaves! Adding a splash of white vinegar to your water tenderizes the artichoke. DON'T add anything else! Don't mess with the inner leaves before serving, that's what table knives are for. I would never make this. They've taken a simple thing and made it complicated.

I acually agree with these two cooks, artichokes should just be steamed in normal water. Artichokes are my ultimate favorite and this recipe just made it complicated

This is a goofy recipe. I eat artichokes all the time (my absolute favorite food) and I have never been this meticulous. I cut off the stem, cut off the pointy parts of the leaves at the top (about an inch), stick 'em in a pot of water, bring to a boil and let them simmer. It takes about 25 minutes of cooking to get a big one just right, but you can test if it's ready by taking your tongs and pulling out a leaf. If it comes off easily, and of course you should try eating it, it's done. For dipping, there are some delicious yogurt sauces out there, but for a casual evening, just some melted butter or lemon is delicious. This recipe makes a delicious food too complicated. Just steam and enjoy!

Next time I'll just use plain water and steam them! It worked for the recipe I was doing (FILETS MIGNONS WITH SPICED BUTTER, GLAZED ARTICHOKES, AND HARICOTS VERTS) but I thought it was too fussy.
