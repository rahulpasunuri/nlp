We used pancetta instead of the salt pork, even though the recipe was still delicious! The salt pork might have had more fat to cook the brussel sprouts in. My second batch was a bit dry and I had to add some canola oil to give it something to saute in.

Really good, but I changed it a bit. I cut the brussel sprouts smaller: into ¼ or even 1/6 if they were really big. Also sliced the shallots. I never used the dill pickle juice& interesting addition which I just didn't have available. I cook this very slowly and patiently in a cast iron skillet so this really caramelizes. Think it was a recipe a friend got from the NYT a long time ago, and we've been using it ever since. It is always a huge hit.

I found the Brussels sprouts to be very hard and not cooked thru. I had to add some chicken stock and cover and steam for about 10 min.

Yum! I used pancetta and this was a hit on our Thanksgiving table...even for the brussel sprout skeptics!
