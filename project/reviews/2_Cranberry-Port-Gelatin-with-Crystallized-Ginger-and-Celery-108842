will make it again, but decrease the ginger by half.

I used a cranberry-blackberry juice cocktail, which was 100% juice but it was sweetened. I didn't add sugar and I thought it was sweet enough. However, I made it only 3 or 4 hours ahead of time, and it wasn't gelling as quickly as I'd hoped, so I put it in the freezer. The freezer did the trick. Next time I would increase the celery and chop the ginger finer than matchstick-sized. Great blend of flavors.

I made this recipe twice because the picture was so beautiful. The first time, it did not set up correctly. The second time, I looked up traditional jello recipes and changed the proportions and it worked. However, I used a bundt pan mold and the result was a flattened jello that did not look anything like the picture. I used the unsweetened cranberry juice and the correct port and the flavor was good. I just could not get it to work correctly.

Well, by mistake, I used ruby not tawny port. The taste was sweet enough without adding sugar, but the color was light and the celery and ginger pieces really showed in an unattractive way. It tasted OK, but most guests passed it by on the buffet line.

Oh, I'm so glad you mentioned this - thank you! I spent 10 minutes at the store trying to decide what juice to buy. I ended up with the 100% (no sugar added) variety, so I guess I will have to add sugar or brave the supermarket later today (the WEDNESDAY before Thanksgiving!) and buy the cocktail....

***** WARNING! ***** Did they leave out the sugar?? As I was cooling the mixture prior to refrigeration, my wife tasted it and made a face: Way too tart, inedible, my wife was right. So I browsed similar recipes here and saw that everyone adds sugar. So I rewarmed it and added 1-1/2 c. sugar in half-cup increments--then I judged it had a nice balance. Now I am back to jelling it in the fridge. Tomorrow I will see what happens. I used hard-to-find 100% cranberry juice as called for in the recipe, but then I am something of a purist. Maybe using instead those sweetened "cranberry fruit cocktail" things would obviate the need for sugar? Note: I am making this three days before Thanksgiving 2003 and reporting on it prior to tasting it as a finished dish, so take this review with a grain of sugar. Maybe my early jump here will help potential victims, maybe not. What do you all think? Hope I have not made a public fool of myself for doubting--and changing--the recipe!
