This is so pretty when made in a glass bowl and tastes superb. I always get rave reviews when I make it. I use oj from concentrate, cut back a little on the cranberries, and like other reviewers made my own syrup with crystallized ginger. I think I use the full amount of ginger, and I don't think it is too much at all.

This is delicious! I used half the amount of dried cranberries, half the amount of orange juice, and half the amount of ginger preserves. There was plenty of ginger flavor and plenty of liquid.

loved the combination of fruits! However, you need to cut WAY back on the ginger! I made my own ginger syrup from crystalized ginger soaked in hot water and pureed. I will make again becuase of the yummy combo of fruits, but will significantly reduce the ginger.

I made this for Christmas brunch. It's a nice change from the "usual" cranberry dishes that are served during the holidays. I used crytalized ginger instead of ginger preserves and was very pleased with the dish. Next time I may add orange or lemon zest.

Fresh tasting and good balance of flavors. Juices from grapefruit and pineapple should be added to make up the 2 cups of juice. Even that is more than needed. I used half the amount of preserved ginger, which added a nice subtle flavor. Everyone loved it!

I served this dish to rave reviews of my guests. I used just one-third of a jar of preserved ginger, which I found in an Asian market. That is definitely enough, otherwise the fruit would be overwhelmed by too much ginger. I made this two days before serving, and it held up beautifully. Will definitely make again.

I found preserved ginger in syrup in an Asian food market. I have often made fruit salad with chopped crystalize ginger thrown in for flavor. The amount the recipe required is way too much. Too bad - I ended up with alot of left over fruit.

I made this for the first time for a holiday dessert party in 1992 and I've made it many times since. It's incredible! Everyone likes the nice change from so many heavy desserts. It makes a beautiful presentation on a holiday buffet. I've sometimes had trouble finding preserved ginger in syrup so I've used crystallized ginger, ground it and soaked it in water and it's worked great.
