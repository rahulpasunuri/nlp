Made for my husband with hopes I'd get a taste but he devoured it before I got to have any chicken. I did enjoy the sauce over mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Not a fan. The chicken was blah and the onions were mushy. I was so excited too.

YUM!!! This was so good. Served over leftover rice pilaf with a green salad it was wonderful. Used a little flour, mushrooms, and balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. I didn't actually measure any seasonings, just added to taste so it wasn't bland at all and used three times the chicken, but boneless skinless thighs instead to cut fat, and because it's what I had on hand. Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times now, and absolutly love it! Its always a hit with whoever I am cooking for. I have used a couple different beers, but New Castle really gives it the best taste, over darker and hoppier beers. I also have used Chinese Five spice instead of all spice and think it tastes much better. I serve this over roasted garlic mashed potatoes and its the perfect combination and the thinner sauce isn't a problem on mashed potatoes as it might be over noodles. The roasted garlic potatoes really brings the chicken up a notch. I also used just a bit more mustard and definitely switch out the Vinegar with balsamic and sometimes I need to add flour and sometimes I don't. I highly reccomend this dish and its pretty easy to make too! If you have tried it and didn't like it, maybe try switching up the beer you used, it really affects the flavor.

THis dish is very unusual. It certainly reveals it's northern european roots in it's flavor (sweet sour and hoppy). So if you like that type of food you'll love this dish. MIght not be the best dish for a dinner party as i could see some people hating it. But if you like everything that goes into the pot, you'll like the finished product. ALso you could add any veggies that might be good in a stew parsnips, peas, carrots, mushrooms, potatoes. I would stay away from turnips and bitter greens because i think they would make the dish taste too bitter.

Wow. Worst recipe I've ever made from Epicurious... the sauce was awful. I subbed in balsamic as per other reviewers, followed it to the T otherwise... It came out almost sour. Very unappealing. Definitely not making it again.

Rating: 2
Even after taking all of the reviewer's suggestions (adding flour, balsamic vinegar and mushrooms) this dish was still soupy and kind of bland. If I were to make it again I would add more herbs and vegetables but, I must say, I probably won't.

I would have given 2 forks, but hubby liked it a lot so I am giving it 3. I added flour, mushroom, balsamic, and garlic as per previous reviewers. I also added a little cream at the end because I want to soften up the flavors. Served with wide butter noodles.

I converted this for my pressure cooker and used a Belgian triple for the beer. It was fantastic.

I thought this was delicious and plan to make again. I followed others' suggestions by adding baby button mushrooms (quartered) and substituting balsamic for red wine vinegar. I wish I had added flour to the onion mixture before adding the beer & broth b/c the sauce turned out very thin. I also served over pureed roast acorn squash instead egg noodles, which added some great flavor and really rounded out the meal.

Wow...was this ever good! I followed suggestions and used mushrooms and balsamic vinegar. This was equally as good leftover as fresh. This recipe will be in the rotation this winter.

I added the flour/changed the vinegar to balsamic and loved this dish. I did find it a little to sweet so I will add less sugar and more dijon next time. And serve over mashed potatoes.

Rating: 2
Even though this smelled amazing while cooking, the flavors were too mild for me. While it was easy to make, I prefer things with more intense flavors.

Rating: 3
i didn't have allspice so i substituted 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 freshly grated nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp grated cloves. i was a little worried about this when i first started to prepare it - it smelled like snickerdoodles and i thought it'd be too sweet - but it was delicious, although i found that the butter and chicken stock separated quite a bit. i would recommend pouring out some of the chicken fat and butter after taking out the browned chicken - i found it made the dish a little too oily.

Nice hearty flavors, I did not add flour as suggested in reviews and found the sauce thickened fine. Served with noodles. Huge hit with my husband.

Rating: 3
This was good. Unfortunately my sauce mixture/onions burnt to the bottom of the pan! I'm going to try it again and see how it turns out. I used my trusty enamel cast iron cooking pot so maybe I'll do the nonstick pan and see how it does. Will try with Balsamic Vinegar as other reviewers suggested. It was still good, all things considered, especially served over rice. Very flavorful and great "cool weather" dish. (It's a rainy spring day here.)

Most excellent! I took everyone's advice...added mushrooms (used white button ones), balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and added flour. Served it over egg noodles - it was really great. This is one for the regular rotation. Total comfort food. Yum!

Forgot to mention, I used Dogfish Head's Raison D'Etre Belgian Dark Ale (one of my favorite beers) and would do so again.

I halved this recipe, used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, added portobellas and a teaspoon of flour as per other reviewers' suggestions, cut the cooking time in half and served with yams instead of pasta. The result: Tender chicken in a flavorful sauce and an all-around delicious and hearty meal. My fiance and I both loved this meal (he thought the mushrooms made all the difference). So glad I read everyone's suggestions first!

This is definitely one of my new favorite easy meals!! If you like carmelized balsamic onions, you'll love this dish (if you switch out the red wine vinegar with balsamic, that is). I followed the recipe closely, but did take the advice of previous reviewers by adding 1 Tbsp flour to the onion mixture (after it cooked 10 min), and then I also added probably about 2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar to the onions and stirred till it thickened up. Then I added the bay leaves, mustard (I increased it to 3 tsp), sugar, broth, and beer. I mixed this all together and then added the chicken. I will do exactly the same next time, as we thought it was perfect. I used a Black Butte Porter, and the flavor was great--not bitter at all, and we could really taste the beer. We had it with noodles as suggested, and I thought they went well together, as there was a lot of yummy sauce to be soaked up! We will definitely make again.

Letting the sauce thicken to my desired consistency usually makes it a tad too bitter - thus I've began using some corn starch to thicken the sauce. It also turns out that my husband and I simply love sweet potatoes with this dish (quickly boiled in salt & sugar water) - perfect balance of sweet, sour & bitter. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe but wish I would have read all your comments first! I doubled the recipe and it came out too soupy. Next time I'll double the chicken, but keep everything else the same. I added balsamic to the leftovers and that really added to the flavor. My only complaint was that it was a touch greasy. Maybe next time I'll remove some of the fat before sauteeing the onions.

This was an easy recipe and very flavorful. Use Sam Adams Cream Stout and and balsamic vinegar. I did add some flour to the onions before adding the liquid as suggested and that worked well...might add a bit more next time to make the sauce a bit thicker. Really good winter meal

I thought this recipe had wonderful flavors and the rest of the family loved it, too. I did not use a dark beer as I didn't have any on hand so a pale ale was added instead.

Rating: 2
To be honest, this might only rate 1 1/2 forks for me. It smelled sensational while cooking, but the end result just wasn't that great. It's kind of like onion soup with chicken in it. I guess I just don't like onions that much. But it did make me realize the potential of braised chicken thighs; I will look for better recipes.

Rating: 0
Good recipe, with lots of room for customization. I will certainly make this again. I used only two thighs, half an onion, and served it with mashed potatoes instead of noodles and steamed haricots verts. Warning! I used a very hoppy beer (rogue dead guy ale) and the bitterness was *almost* overwhelming. I would recommend something smoother like the beers used by other reviewers.

Rating: 3
good recipe. very easy. ate it over brown rice instead of noodles. Modifications: I deglazed the pan with some beer to cut down on the fat and add some flavor. I added mushrooms after it was uncovered. changed the brown sugar to succanat, used homemade vegetable broth instead of beef (it was what was on hand), and a strongly flavored coriander infused golden beer (also what was in the fridge). It worked well-it's a versatile recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a keeper! Could add 4-6 more chicken thighs without increasing the onion/sauce combination. Thanks to those cooks who suggested thickening the onion mixture. I added 1 T of flour to the onions after the initial 10 min. and sauted an addtional 2 minutes. I also agree with several other cooks who added more vinegar than in the original recipe. Used Yuengling Black & Tan for the beer.

This recipe was really good and easy to make. From start to finish it probably took me about an hour to do. I added garlic and a couple of cups of mushrooms to the recipe. Next time I think I will try to make it with olive oil instead of butter and maybe a little more mustard.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe exactly as written and it took about an hour and a half. It was pretty good but nothing to rave about, especially considering the time it took to make. It was a nice winter meal at home but I probably wouldn't consider making it for company.

I really liked this recipe, felt it was an easy comfort food and relatively healthy. I did not have all spice so I did a mixture of cinnamon fresh grated nutmeg and baking spice. I increased the sugar to 4 tsp and then added a 5th to the mustard mixture. I also added 1 extra tsp of vinegar. I would definitely make this again and for friends. or just me --

An easy and hearty meal which I served over buttered egg noodles. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 8 which came to 1.3 lbs), and for the beer used my favourite, Newcastle Brown Ale (English).

This is a great family meal that could also be served without apology to guests. Wonderful flavor. Comfort food without a lot of calories. I used skinless boneless thighs, Guinness beer and hit it harder with mustard and more vinegar. I served it with noodles and a butter lettuce and orange salad dressed with a blue cheese vinaigrette. Add crusty bread and you are good to go.

I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs. The onions took a little longer to cook than indicated in the recipe to get the right golden brown color, and I wanted the sauce to be fairly thick, so at the end I removed the chicken to a plate and boiled the sauce for about five minutes. I tripled the recipe with 12 thighs and it served six people, who all loved the rich flavor. I've already been asked to make it again.

Yum! Great on a cold winters weeknight with egg noodles and frozen peas.

Delicious! What a wonderful dish for a winter evening! I used Sameul Smith Nut Brown Ale from England, which worked well. Great mix of flavors. Next time I will pour off some of the fat before carmelizing the onions. I served this with mashed rutabaga and steamed broccoli- great comfort food for a winter supper. This is definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
Delicious. The sweetness was a different flavor for us (we tend more towards spicy/tart flavors), but it was a nice change of pace. It definietly needs to be served with some kind of starch. We served alone since we don't care for egg noodles (as the recipe recommends), but were left wishing we had rice or bread to soak up some of the delicious sauce left over. It was maybe a bit bland to make for company, but made for a warm weeknight meal.

I found this recipe in the "Quick and Easy" category. It is definitely easy, though I personally think an hour of prep/cooking time isn't all that quick. Nevertheless, the flavors were very good. Next time, I may try boneless, skinless thighs to make it more stew-like.

I thought this dish was wonderful and easy. I think I might try a little more mustard next time to maybe even out the sweet. I served it over a tofu noodle. It saves on the carb issue and is great if your gluten intolerant.

My family liked this dish. I did change a few things. I used a little more red wine vinegar with a touch more alspice than suggested, and used a very dark molassas based beer. I think this recipe would also be great using beef instead of chicken.

I'm with the writer tho thinks this recipe needs something. It was OK, just not excellent. A good cook or chef, I'm sure, could recommend a twist that would improve it, but I don't know what that would be. It WAS very easy to prepare. Suggestion -- trim most of the fat off thighs and consider using skinless thighs. The dish had too much fat. Thickening wasn't an issue -- a small amount of cornstarch did the trick.

This recipe needs something IMO. This turned out bitter and sweet. A little crushed red pepper may round this out.

Rating: 1
Bland and sweet. This needs more zip to it...there wasn't enough of a flavour to balance out the sugary part. We normally do a stew along the same style with olives and saffron in a more tomato-y base... this needed something extra...a spice or a stronger broth. It just didn't do it for me. El blando.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I subbed boneless skinless thighs and that worked nicely. Bay leaf is essential, it added a wonderful flavor and aroma. The gravy was really thick, maybe because I simmered the chicken for so long (being a little paranoid about undercooked chix!) so next time maybe I would use a little more beer to thin down the gravy :)

Made this last night and it was a hit. I made it with six thighs for four people, added a little more beer and broth, and it was all gone by the end of the meal. The only changes I made were to add a few garlic cloves to the onions, and as was suggested, I thickened the sauce at the end with arrowroot and red wine vinegar. I served it with steamed potatoes, which went well with the delicious sauce.

Rating: 4
I took the other reviewer's advice and added some flour while sauteeing the onions and the sauce turned out perfectly. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which had a great flavor with the sauce & cut down the cooking time a bit. Husband liked it for something different. It's an easy cold weather recipe that I'll make again.

I normally don't post a review if I change a recipe significantly, but I though I would since the recipe itself mentions that this was originally a beef recipe. I made this with stew beef instead of chicken, added 2Tbls. flour to the onions to thicken the sauce (as a previous reviewer suggested), and substituted white balsamic vinegar for the red wine variety. Marvelous! The kitchen smelled wonderful while this was cooking, and I agree with the other reviewer - this was the perfect meal to end the snowy day we had here in Maine. I will likely make this again this winter - we have a lot of stew beef in the basement freezer.

WWe followed this recipe exactly as well and I agree with the previous reviewer in that it did taste like a perfect "cold weather" dinner. This was good food -- not great food, but for the price, a very nice dish.

Perfect for a cold New England supper; doubled well. Used a cut-up chicken and followed the recipe exactly. Family reviews were to make it again but to thicken the gravy. Even after simmering and reduction it was too thin; added a slurry of 1 T.cornstarch and water which helped but not quite enough. Strongly suggest adding a few tablespoons of flour to the onions once browned and before adding the liquids. Served with egg noodles and steamed broccoli.
