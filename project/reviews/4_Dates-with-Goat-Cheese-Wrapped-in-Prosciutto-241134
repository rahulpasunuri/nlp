I served this at a wine tasting party and the guests loved it. I added fresh thyme and roasted walnuts to the goat cheese and wrapped them in pancetta. One guest revealed later that she thought of chucking it in the garden when no one was looking because she thought she didn't like goat cheese or dates; but in the end, she had seconds! I followed the wine pairing, selecting an organic Sauvignon Blanc and ended up winning for best food and wine pairing!

These are really great, I have also put pine nut inside with the goat cheese.

This was delicious! Used cambozola blue cheese instead of goat cheese and people loved it. Also drizzled with balsamic vinegar after broiling. It was a hit!

Okay, so I didn't have herbed goat cheese, just plain so I used shallot and chive boursin and it was awesome. I did not use the basil leaves but guests raved about this appetizer, there were none left and I made 1.5 recipes for a group of 8. Delicious and super easy!

This recipe made a believer out of me! I was introduced to dates less than a year ago and not having been exposed to this fruit throughout my life, I was a bit apprehensive. I served this dish as a Thanksgiving appetizer to a very eclectic group of friends from all over the globe. It was an overwhelming success and didn't last more than 5 minutes on the plate! I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely be making this quick and easy dish for parties to come.

These are absolutely fantastic. Perfect balance of flavors. The first time I made them, I also found the dates to be a bit overpoweringly sweet (though they were still delicious), so now, I halve the dates and keep everything the same. Super impressive dish considering it requires so little effort.

Quite tasty and easy. Replaced dates with currants, but otherwise followed recipe. Had prosiutto and currants leftover from 2 other appetizers I made for other parties. Ate it for breakfast and would definitely make for a party!

These were a hit at my most recent cocktail party. Very easy to make, big bang for time expended. Disagreed with other reviewers on being too sweet. I did try some with softened blue cheese, but not better than goat cheese, just different. Also wrapped a few with braesola for non-pork eaters which were well received. A keeper!

Rating: 4
Wow! This was awesome. Great balance of salty, sweet, creamy and crunchy. Basil brought out a subtle earthy undertone. Definitely will keep this as the go-to hors d'oeuvres when I want to impress friends without spending too many hours in the kitchen or too much money at the grocery store.

Easy to make. Travels well. It received a few compliments, but was definitely not a hit. I doubt I'd make it again.

I loved the combination of flavors, though I do think the balance could be improved. I will definitely make these again, but next time I'll try them with one of these changes, or a combination of a few: using blue cheese or a blue cheese/goat cheese mix for some pungency; stuffing and wrapping halved dates to cut the sweetness a little; or adding a toasted walnut or chopped walnuts to the cheese for some more texture. That said, these were pretty great for having been so easy and quick to make.

Awesome recipe, made it yesterday. I didn't read the directions and chopped the basil into the cheese..still good. I used honey pitted dates, and it worked out well. The dates were thin and added some sweetness, but not a lot. I'd still like to try with the medjool dates. Placed them on tinfoil and did it on the bbq. Will try directly on the grill with the medjool dates.

I'm vegetarian, but this sounded WAY too good to pass up! I substituted vegetarian bacon strips for the prosciutto, and they were still really delicious. I have already made this recipe twice, and my friends LOVE them - even the meat eaters. :)

I used plain goat cheese but otherwise followed the recipe as written. My guests went nuts over this, and I could not stop eating them. The unusual combination of flavors is amazing! These are also easy to make ahead. I soaked the toothpicks and then made them 6 hours ahead, and the picks turned brown but didn't burn when I broiled them. Definitely a keeper!

I agree with the person who says you need a sweet tooth for this. The dates were extremely sweet, and the goat cheese/prosciutto didn't balance them out. I also thought it was hard to put the cheese in the date (using a spoon). In my mind, the taste didn't justify the effort, though they did look pretty! If I make these again, I might try dried figs instead.

I had high expectations for these, maybe would have liked them more if I were a sweet tooth. They turned out attractive, but if I try again I would incorporate a stronger, sharper cheese into the recipe.

Yum! I did a trial run to make sure I liked these before bringing them to Christmas dinner with the family. They are sooooo good! I would also make them using plain goat cheese instead of the herbed and omitting the basil leaf for a sweeter treat. This recipe is a keeper!

Very tasty and worth making. They definitely need to be served warm. I served them nestled on a plate of roasted red pepper sauce, like a local tapas restaurant does. A prep note: Sometimes having the right tool does make things easier. Superficially, it may sound more complicated to use a pastry bag to stuff the cheese into the dates, but it's actually a lot easier than trying to smoosh it in with a knife or spoon. You'll get a more even distribution of the filling, too, which impacts the overall quality of the food.

Rating: 4
I have served this appetizer many times to a wide variety of guests and the platter is always emptied. My guests routinely request the recipe. I do make them a bit smaller than the recipe since my basil leaves are not always large enough and because as a passed appetizer I prefer the smaller size. I cut the dates in lengthwise quarters, place the date slice on a basil leaf and then spoon the goat cheese on top of the date. I lightly rub the assembly between my palms to create an oval that is easily wrapped in prosciutto. I find that the Prosciutto di Parma provides a crisper texture than others I've tried. I sometimes use the plain goat cheese when I don't feel like making a special trip to the cheese shop.

REPLACE THE CHEESE PLEASE ....After reading the recent reviews I was excited to try this recipe. Unfortunately the flavor of the dates intimidated the delicate flavor of the goat cheese, offering little or no contrasts of sweet & savory flavors. I'm going to try parmesan. I think a strong, aged confident cheese like parmesan is a better match with the dates and will make for a delicious balanced and flavorful bite.

Reading some of these reviews has me chuckling - using a piping bag or syringe to fill the dates? Whatever happened to keeping it simple? A knife or spoon will do just fine, lol.

This is a winner recipe. I made it two times during the Holidays and everytime I got excellent comments. To remove the pit inside the date, I use tweezers. And to put the cheese inside the date, I use a syringe.

Fan-freakin-tastic! These were exactly like the stuffed dates served at Toro, one of the best restaurants in Boston. These were insanely easy to make, I only wish I bought more dates to keep up with the demand from party guests. I made some with basil, some without and the ones with basil were SO much better. Also, I made a few with just basil wrapped around them for the vegetarians in the room, and they went over big as well.

Unbelievably good and super easy. I had to pit the dates, but that ain't no big thang, and I also used plain chevre (not herbed) and American prosciutto -- all good. Really good.

I made this for a derby party... looking for three ingredients to make "Trifecta on a toothpick." I had only scanned this one and had forgotten the basil. It was delicious without the basil. And i used plain goat cheese. I used pitted dates, schmeared the cheese on top, wrapped the proscuitto, I was in a hurry. Made 40 or so in under 20 minutes with the help of my kids. I was in a huge hurry! Well, as weird looking as they were, all forty were gone with 5 miunutes. And everyone was asking for the recipe. So easy and delicious!

Huge hit at our Oscars party. We had plain goat cheese and fresh herbs on-hand, so we made our own herbed goat cheese. Best when eaten immediately after taking out of oven, so I broiled in small batches.

I make these all the time, but with gorgonzola, bacon, and no basil. They are DELICIOUS, easy, and I always get so many compliments. I think blue cheese adds some complexity, and it becomes milder when you cook it (if you're averse to that moldy taste). Also, blue cheese tends to get gooey and caramelized in the oven and tastes amazing!

Made these for a date tonight and they were a big hit, she loved them. Very easy to make, I think next time I would use smoked goat cheese - I think that would go very well with the basil and prosciutto. Highly recommended, I will make these again!

Why in the world would you trim the fat off? Not only is that where the flavor is, it's part of what binds the tastes together as it cooks. If you're that calorie conscious, you may want to serve carrot sticks, instead.

I must have done something wrong - I was disappointed with these. I expected them to be amazing based on the other reviews and I didn't really like them at all. I didn't think the ingredients blended well together. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I trimmed the fat off the prosciutto or that I put a bit too much cheese in each date. Or maybe I didn't cook them long enough. Whatever it was, these didn't work for me. I'd like to try them again and see what happens but they were so disappointing that I don't know if I can be bothered. They do look great though.

I served these at a cocktail party last night and they were a huge hit. I followed other posters' advice and kept them in the broiler until the prociutto (and the basil) crisped. They were still wonderful at room temp. I found enormous basil leaves, which ensured that each bite contained basil. I do think the dates I used were a bit too big (2.5" plus by a little over 1.5"). Next time if the dates are still so big, I'll up the amount of proscuitto to counter the sweetness. Despite the monster dates, people loved how these tasted and that they were different from the usual hors d'oeuvres suspects. They also look and taste like they're a lot more work than they actually are. I'll make these again for sure.

I made these for my New Year's Eve party and everyone LOVED them. The basil really does add something.

Divine! Melt-in-your-mouth perfect right out of the broiler, but if you want a cripser, meatier texture, broil until the prosciutto crisps, then cool to room temperature. I could probably eat a tray for dinner! I just might! ;P

I agree with other reviewers that this would be just as well served without cooking it and that the flavor was surprisingly good. They were very easy to make, paired salty and rich very well, and are a great holiday treat. I pitted my own Medjool dates since I couldn't find any that were already pitted and this only added a few minutes to prep time.

The recipe was also a hit at my holiday party. a few recommendations: Make sure to get pitted dates (Earthbound Farms has some). Use a pastry bag to fill the dates w/ goat cheese. When ordering the proscuitto, get it sliced a little thicker than normal b/c very thin proscuitto sticks to the deli paper and is difficult to cut into thin strips.

I recently had this at a holiday party. To my surprise it was VERY good as I typically dont like dates. The person who made them,also left out the basil but I am certain it would have only enhanced this unusually delectible appetizer. The flavors of the salt from the prosciutto with the sweet of the date along with the creaminess of the goat cheese worked very well together. I will make these and not leave out anything.
