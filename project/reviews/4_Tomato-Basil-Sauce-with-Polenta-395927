This was very good, especially with homegrown cherry tomatoes. That being said, I will make the following changes: add a bit of cracked red pepper to the sauce for a bit of kick and I will cut the polenta thicker 3/4 - 1 inch. Also, it's nearly impossible to get a tight seal with three layers of parchment paper, so I rolled and stapled them together. It worked great. Also, I think this sauce would be pleasant with pasta too.

This is SO EASY and so delicious. Perfect weeknight meal along with a big salad or a roasted vegetable. I will definitely make this again!

OMG! Once again, something so easy and so flavorful! We had a grillin' night wtih our dinner tonight. Did the Tomato-basil sauce per the recipe in the oven and grilled the polenta along with marinated chicken breasts, and asparagus. Could not have been easier and more flavorful! My husband and I were discussing as the previous review how this would make a great brushetta. Love this recipe for the ease and all the flavor!

Made this (sauce) tonight - as written - for my vegetarian daughter and omnivore husband - both loved it. It was exceptionally good and the leftovers would make a great omelet or bruschetta topping as well. My husband grilled the polenta and that came out fine. My only problem was crimping the parchment paper - I had no idea how to do that, and obviously didn't do a great job because the packet leaked. The sauce didn't seem the worse for it, though. Other than the parchment part, it was very easy to do and I will definitely be making it again.
