My favorite chilled soup is gazpacho, and tried this for a change of pace. Nice taste, but maybe we're not chilled soup people. Heated, it was better.

I subtituted arugula for watercress and it came out great. I added a little lime juice for brightness and homemade veg stock instead of chicken stock because I am not partial to protien stocks in cold soups. All in all a keeper and I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, but my "large" bunch of watercress only yielded 2 cups instead of 4, and the results were not as flavorful as I expected. However, this was inexpensive, healthy and easy to make. I'll make it again, probably using arugula instead of watercress as others have suggested. Give this a try, but make sure that you have 4 cups of watercress!

I substituted arugula for watercress as another reviewer did, and probably used a lot more fennel than called for. Really good, especially for such a healthy soup! I'm tempted to add some fresh herbs next time.

Like other reviewers, I served this hot. Next time I would replace some of the celery for fennel since I wanted the fennel flavor to be stronger. I didn't have white wine so I substituted with a splash of pernod. All said, this is an absolutely delicious soup.

I served hot, and substituted argula for watercress. All 9 guests loved this soup.

This should really be a 3.5 rather than a 3-- I find myself looking forward to my next excuse to eat this soup! It's buttery yet light, with a mild fennel and watercress flavor that doesn't need much added salt and pepper. Next time I'll experiment with increasing the watercress and the ginger to see how the soup fares with a bit more bite. I didn't bother with getting celery, and simply substituted the fennel stalks instead. (Anyone else know why there aren't more recipes that use fennel stalks?) Thanks to a reviewer (of a different recipe) who alluded to green splotches on the walls, I remembered to be careful pureeing the hot soup and covered the top of the blender with a towel. That will be easy to remember, now that I'll be making this soup frequently!

I love this soup hot, with its subtle healthy flavors. I add a bit more ginger than the 1/2 t. called for and tried substituting fresh spinach leaves for the watercress, with good results.
