Incredibly long prep. The soup was way too sweet for my tastes. Only 1 fork.

We made this recipe exactly as written, and it was fantastic. The crab-cleaning process was slow, as was the 1.5 hours of boiling the broth down, but it was worth it!!! We would serve this to company, but we would make the broth the day before!

Very good, but takes a long time to make. Full of lots of flavor due to long prep/cooking time. I followed the recipe exactly and it was really yummy. Will reserve this for special occasions and Sunday dinners when I have more time to cook. Wish you could buy the dungeness crab stock premade!

Living here in Dungeness we really, really have fresh seafood. My friend just made this dish and it was truely delectible. Had to find it, to make it myself!

It looks good on the screen but I'll have to try it to really be a good judge!

Although this dish is a bit time consuming, it is a fabulous dish for a special occasion. I'v been making it since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetite. Great Dish.
