Ghod! What a treat for me! Crunchy, salty, oily (in the good sardine oil way) which was perfect for the texture of the dish overall. The grilled lime added the final touch of taste and class. Not to mention how easy and quick it was, the batter sticks and covers the fish really well and the final product always looks appetizing, I've already memorized the recipe and could probably make a batch in under 10 minutes at minimal cost. I also love how original the recipe is, I plan to make it again and experiment with sides, wines and seasonings, though the recipe as it is is incredible. I plan on cooking these up for sports parties as a snack to go with beer and recommending it for any fish lovers I meet.

Not being one who can ever exactly follow a recipe (much to my daughter's dissapointment) I improvised a bit. First by using fresh sardines instead of canned ones. I added some extra seasonings to the batter. YUMMY!!!!

I love sardines and am going to try this recipe soon. As for frying lime, I've grilled lime before, and it's similar to grilling lemons. It changes the flavor to a creamy, softer version. I'm interested to see if frying is similar.

I thought this was a very good recipe...I really liked how the fried lime had an "enhanced" taste...different and good. I can't help but agree with the other reviewers; the "cook" from Tallahassee is clearly not a foodie and likely not even an adult. And to our friend in Cairns: if we didn't want to discover new ways to prepare food, we wouldn't bother coming to this site in the first place, would we? This site should remove stupid and senseless comments like these two.

A note to Cook from Columbus: I love sardines and I use "King Oscar Skinless And Boneless (and headless)Sardines"

Why not fry lime wedges?? Its different and the beaty of using arecipe is that you dont HAVE to follow it exactly if you dont want to. I like the fried lime and so did the guest I made this for.
