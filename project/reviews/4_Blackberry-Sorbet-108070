7/16/08 I made this last weekend with fresh picked raspberries. (On my scale 5 cups = 1.5 pounds.) I used 1 cup of sugar and added 2 Tbs. of Lemoncello. It was refreshingly tart and delicious!

Easy recipe, tasted great. I used a blender to puree the berries and didnt care for the little bits of blackberry seeds that seem to sneak in through the sieve though. Wish I could get rid of them.

To the cook who asked, how many cups of berries are in 1 1/2 pounds: According to the information printed on the bag, a pound of frozen blackberries yields about three 1-cup servings so 1 1/2 pounds would be about 4 1/2 cups.

I really enjoyed this. It is so super easy. I loved the addition of the lemoncello. I used 1 cup of sugar and would decrease that to 1/2 cup next time. The berries should really shine.

This is delicious. I served this as a palate cleanser in our 12 course New Year's Eve dinner. I used less sugar,served small one scoop servings in ramekins with a single blackberry and mint leaf. It was perfect. We also had leftovers and ate it for brunch!

I threw in a bit more blackberries, and used two Tbsp lemonicello (in place of lemon juice) as others suggested, and this was EXCELLENT! Tastes like fresh berries. My husband liked it better than any ice creams I have made, and he's an ice cream addict.

This is delicious!Very easy to make, and I used another reviewer's suggestion of using a tablespoon of limoncello. It was a little more lemony than I might have preferred, but still a winner. Next time I might try half a tablespoon of limoncello, but I will still use it. Fabulous...worth all those hours picking berries!

Until I made this exquisite blackberry sorbet, Blackberry Sourcream Pie was my favorite. I doubled the recipe, using only a cup of sugar (per batch)and added 2 Tbls. Lemoncello (per batch). It was perfect and definitely worth the time it took to make. Next time I'll make a triple batch in order to fill my ice cream freezer container. I'm now motivated to keep picking that seemingly endless supply of blackberries in our back yard. Mmmmmm.

I'm pretty confident that I used more than a 1 1/2 pounds of blackberries, but it was a welcome mistake! When I strained the berries and syrup mixture, it was so think it took 10 minutes and serious labor with a spatula to force it through the strainer. However, the end result was pure heaven! We topped it with freshly whipped cream with a dash of sugar. My husband and I agreed it was the best sorbet either of us had ever tasted. For the record I used a 10 oz frozen bag of organic blackberries and I froze some fresh berries overnight that i had washed and placed on a cookie sheet.

I'm planning to make this tonight. To answe the cook from Boston's question, I believe 2 cups of berries equals one pound.

Beautiful color! This sorbet was great- everyone devoured it. I added just a little extra lemon juice and served it with waffle cookies.

Could anyone tell me how many cups of blackberries there were in 1 1/2 lbs? I have lots of fresh blackberries and would like to use them to make this sorbet. thanks.

Suggest premade syrup, made ahead so that it will be chilled.

Just a touch too sweet (and I never say that about anything!), so next time I will add a little less sugar. This was an excellent sorbet, it didn't get too hard in the freezer, and actually kept a good texture for 5 days (at which point it was all eaten). I'll definitely make this again, so nice for summer.

Light, fresh and delicious. It was soooo easy to make. The color was gorgeous. I only changed the recipe a little I added a couple tablespoons of Chambord just because with out a little alcohol sorbet can freeze up so hard it bends your spoon. With that addition it was the perfect texture.

This was just fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit. The color and texture and sweetness were perfect. I served it white ramkins set on individual bean shaped plates, and passed a tray of my favorite cookie creations. It was a nice refreshing end to a big dinner.
