Very festive and fun- perfect for a tin of Christmas cookies.

I'm gonna go ahead and guess that the previous reviewer was JOKING when he/she described putting actual poinsettias in the batter ... of course it is always hard to tell in a forum like this, so no offense to the NY reviewer ... :) Merry Christmas!

I have not actually made these cookies, but was shocked to read the most recent review, where the cook put poinsettias from her garden into the cookie batter. These cookies do not contain actual poinsettias. Poinsettias are NOT EDIBLE. They are POISONOUS. Do not put them in the batter.

I thought this would be a great recipe. so i went out into my garden to harvest my Poinsettias. i put the the flowers into the batter. the batter turned out bitter, the next day i felt sick but now i am feeling better.next time i will use more sugar.

This was the worse cookie recipe that I have ever made! The cookies were still raw looking after 10 minutes. And, the taste was bland, like cookie dough. I don't know what happened here but there was nothing delicious about this cookie. Way too much work for the taste!

A pretty good cookie. They looked nicer a little bigger - I used a 2" square cookie cutter. Added red food coloring and a red candy in the center. Be sure not to roll them too thin. They also bake well on parchment paper - no greased cookie sheet required.

I thought making these cookies was a pain in the neck. The dough was not that easy to work with and it was very labor intensive. The flavor was ok--so-so. It was not worth the time and effort. The cookies were very pretty but I think you can get pretty cookies an easier way.

These cookies are so cute, and pretty tasty. I used red sugar on the "leaves" of the cookie, and a butterscotch chip in the center. I wanted to use a white choc. chip as someone else suggested, but only had butterscotch on hand. I also followed another suggestion of substituting 1 tsp of peppermint extract for the almond extract. The results were great, but I think I would have preferred the almond flavor better. These cookies are pretty time-consuming to make, because of shaping the pinwheels, but they make such a unique shape that it's worth it. It is easier to work with the dough if it is well-chilled, so we worked in small batches while making the poinsettia shapes, and kept the dough we weren't using in the fridge until needed.

I made these cookies for my parents for Valentine's day. I cut the sugar to about 4/5 of a cup because my mom doesn't like things very sweet- and they were a hit! I used heart-shaped cookie cutters to make them more valentine-y. The only problem I found was that the cooking time given was WAY too short, even though I made the cookies thinner than they said to. Another little problem was that there is no way of lessening the amount of cookies to make- 5 dozen! Luckily, they are addictive, so they go fast, but I still would have preferred fewer cookies. This was the first time I had ever made cookies from scratch, and they turned out terrifically!

I was looking for simple and clever and got both, plus tasty! I used red edible glitter (available at cake decorating stores) with gold candy balls in the center for half of the recipe, and white edible glitter with silver candy balls for the other half. The added plus for me was that I finished just in time to serve some hungry carolers at our door! Perfect timing!

Wow! What a beautiful and tasty cookie! I took the cook's suggestion from St. Louis and added the red food coloring and white chocolate chip. I made a third batch without the food coloring and substituted the almond extract with 1 tsp. of pepermint extract. Yummy! They were the first batch to disappear at the party. I'll definitely be making these every Christmas. (they are worth the extra effort)

I agree, this is an easy recipe! Be sure to roll the dough as directed for the best results. I added red food coloring with the flour and salt. Then lightly pressed a white morsel chip in the middle for a different look. They made a great presentation.

Wow, what a beautiful cookie. These were incredibly easy, very delicious, and fun to make. Even the ones that came out bad, looked very good. A definite keeper.

A delicious cookie, but time consuming. Make sure you don't roll the dough too thin. I used three "red hots" for the center of the cookie and sprinkled the rest with the red decorating sugar for a more impressive presentation.
