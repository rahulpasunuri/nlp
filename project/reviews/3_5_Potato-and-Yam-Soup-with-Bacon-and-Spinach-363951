This was fabulous and perfect for a winter evening. I actually doubled this for the leftovers. I added a cup of carrots cut into 1/3 slices, and two cans of drained black beans. I had an open container of chicken stock, so I used probably half stock/half broth. I also had some left over crushed tomatoes, and because I love tomatoes, I tossed that in, too. Next time I make this (and I will for certain), I might consider some white beans, too, possibly garbanzo beans as one reviewer mentioned. I might change it up and use an apple chicken sausage I've had before in place of the bacon, but I did love it with the bacon. My boyfriend made savory biscuits with colby cheese to go along with this. I'm crazy excited for the leftovers today for lunch!

Very hearty soup. I used immersion blender for a few seconds to make a thicker soup before adding bacon and spinach. I also sprinkled on some red pepper flakes for added flavor. Also served it with cornbread. You won't be disappointed.

Great soup!! I added 2 large carrots (chopped)with the onions and served with cornbread. Yum. This will definitely be a regular to my recipes.

I loved this soup for its simple ingredients, the ease of making it, and the delicious flavor. My favorite way to cook is to take very basic ingredients to new heights of deliciousness. For me, this soup fits the bill. It reminds me of the way Alice Waters and David Tanis cook, and they are two of my favorite chefs. Simple and delicious time after time.

Overall this soup is good but I would recommend adding some touches. I forgot thyme so I added a bay leaf and a big squeeze of lemon as the broth was a little lacking. Next time maybe some Hungarian paprika or soy. But a very hearty stew. I used two yams and two potatoes and half spinach, half kale and added garbanzos.

3 1/2 forks easily. What would have put this to 4 forks would have been more bacon in the final servings or another protein, perhaps some beans or chicken sausage. Next time I'll just make a little additional bacon for the end. You can certainly cut some of the bacon fat out, a little goes a long way for the flavor so don't eliminate it all together.

Yum! This was delicious. I'd say 3 1/2 forks. I made it as is, but next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I'd cut back on the other potatoes and bump up the yams and bacon.

Delicious! I'd say 3 1/2 forks for sure. I made it as is, and would definitely make it again. The only change I'd make next time would be to add at least double the bacon, or maybe a can of black beans to bump up the protein. Yum!

Very very good. Easy to prep, easy to cook. I used mixed greens instead of just spinach because I did not have enough to start with. Also one of those recipes where most of the ingredients are already around the house, so no major shopping is necessary.

Great flavours, simple and quick. Poured off most (all but 1 tbsp) of the bacon fat, since there was at least 1/4 cup left in the pot. Also pureed the soup before adding spinach & bacon at the end.

Yummy! I pureed about 2/3 of it before adding the spinach and bacon. It could maybe have used some more sweet potato, but it was really good as is.

Wonderful! Didn't change anything and it got rave reviews from everyone.
