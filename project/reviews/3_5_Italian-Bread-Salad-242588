Makes a great main dish when paired with soup and some anti-pasta meat.

This was easy and yummy and perfect for a summer day. A tomato salad on the side made it even better. I will make this again!

Great recipe. The second time I tried it, I substituted balsamic vinegar and added cubed mozarella and pine nuts to create a main-dish salad. Even my greens- hating, meat-loving son liked it.

This is a fantastic summer salad. I served it to my Italian family and they loved it. I made a few slight changes. I toasted the croutons with EVOO and I did NOT mix them with the greens until right before serving- this kept the croutons crunchy. I also eliminated the oliver - the taste of the fresh "greens" was very refreshing on a hot summer day, and I didn't chop the capers - I used salt-cured capers and kept them whole. Yum!!

This was very surprising. The first bites had me feeling rather noncommittal, but it grew on me very quickly. I really, really liked it! I didn't notice the celery and didn't have any on hand, but it was a minor exception. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Yummy. Served it with a tomato and feta salad and they really complimented each other. Would also be good topped with grilled or roasted fish or chicken. Made no changes to the recipe. It is good as is.

A nice light meal Enjoyed it on the Boat and it was easy enough to make at home and pack in a cooler. Thanks

It would be more accurate to describe this as a cucumber salad with olives, Italian herbs and croutons. In no way does this resemble a true Italian bread salad (otherwise known as a panzanella). More importantly that nomenclature, is taste. On that score, the salad is just so-so.

I really liked this salad. I've made it twice this month. I liked it better the second day because the bread was less crunchy. Next time I make it I'll just use some day old bread and skip the oven part. The description of the recipe was good. It is very light and earthy! It's a nice alternative to potato salad or pasta salad.

I agree with the previous review. Delicious. I like the suggestion of serving with a side of prosciutto and mozzarella salad!
