I liked these zucchini, but was a little bit disappointed. They tasted great, but did not look as impressive as I wanted them to. My dinner guests didn't even really comment on them. All that stuffing and deep frying with a thermometer, and they looked the same as they did before I did anything to them! The stuffing was perfect and I wouldn't change that, but if I make these again I may try lightly battering them, or just give them an egg-wash and bake them, instead.

The saltiness of the cheese balances perfectly with the sweetness of the squash itself. This is a great side dish for brunch--it looks really impressive, it can go to room temperature without losing anything, and the savory is a nice contrast to the often sweet or bland brunch standards. Another favorite--you just can't go wrong with the recipes from this "Gourmet" Cretan Picnic.

Sorry to comment before making the recipe, but I have been experimenting with stuffed squash blossoms for a while. I wasn't very fond of the 3 generations of squash recipe of Epicurious- overall, I have not found a batter I liked, neither tempura nor traditional. Frying without a batter sounds terrific. If you want to experiment with different cheeses, remember: aged cheeses and naturally low-oil cheeses are best (mozz is not too oily, I believe) I began this in Mexico, with Oaxacan cheese, a delicious way to go, especially with herbs and carne asada inside. You can also grill blossoms (on foil), a method I love. Right now is the time of year for squash blossoms; farmer's market is always the way to go. If you can't find them, ask a grower who sells squash whether they can get you some. Sorry for the length, folks, but lastly, the damn tastiest thing I have done with these blossoms is to stuff them with spiced banana and coat them in a banana pancake batter- powdered sugar or fresh cinnamon whipped cream, and you will have them all at your fingertips. Bon apetit!

To A Cook from Raleigh, NC: Look in the classified adds. Farms sometimes advertise as pick-your-own.

This sounds yummy, but where can I find baby zucchini with the blossoms still attached? The farmers market? Thanks for your thoughts.
