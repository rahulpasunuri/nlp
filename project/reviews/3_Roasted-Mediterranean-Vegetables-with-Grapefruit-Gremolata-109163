This was absolutely delicious! As another reviewer had mentioned, I did not do the gremolata, but did everything else as written. I must say, the vegetables actually tasted even better the next day! Next time I am going to try adding some baby red potatoes just to see how it tastes... maybe some mushrooms, too.

Excellent recipe, though it seemed a little heavy on the zucchini & eggplant. It's a nice alternative to the typical olive-oil soaked roasted veggie recipe and went especially well with chicken and fettuccine alfredo.

Delicious, easy, with a little interesting twist--everyone loved it!

This is the first time I've tried gremolata. It made the dish. I happen to love the flavor of grapefruit but something fresh and tart along with the savory roasted veggies is happiness for the tastebuds.

Excellent. The grapefruit added a wonderfully unique citrus flavor - a welcome change from lemon or orange. I added toasted bread crumbs to the gremolata and roasted the grapefruit in quarters. My guests either ate the grapefruit along with the vegies, or squeezed the juice onto the vegies. Sweet grapefruit is the key. I made this once with a bitter grapefruit and it was almost inedible.

This recipe really appealed to me. I love basalmic and roasted veggies. For some reason though this just wasnt very good. I think its one of those dishes that tries really hard but just ends up so so.

Actually, I got so busy with the preparation of the rest of the meal, I forgot all about the Gremolta and served the roasted vegetables without it. It was excellent! I too could not get Japanese eggplant and used "regular" which I peeled and cut into large chunks (without salting). My recommendation is to use a very good quality balsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar is like wine -- if it is not good enough to drink, don't cook with it! To the cook about the question concerning the root of the onion -- half the onion (leaving the root attached), then cut each half into approx. 4 or more sections. Leaving the root on holds the slices intact.

Surprisingly good for such a simple recipe. I didn't do the gremolata and substituted regular eggplant (salted it the usual way in advance.) Perhaps that's why it didn't need additional salt - just a bit of pepper. The vegetables are very flavorful, and not oily at all. Next time I'm making more - leftovers were excellent cold as a salad.

Good side dish! Easy to make and very flavorful. The gremolata puts a different twist on the roasted vegetables-- very good.

I couldn't find find Japanese eggplant so I used one regular and added a yellow squash for some extra color. But when it came to the red onion I was a bit confused. Do you leave the root intact and therefore the onion stays whole or do you cut some off of it and then why leave the root intact. But the flavor and ease of making was great. And the gremolata added a nice contrast. Next time I might add some green beans for some added flavor and dimension

was easy to make, and delicious! Is good with or without the Gremolata. I would probably prefer a little less garlic next time.
