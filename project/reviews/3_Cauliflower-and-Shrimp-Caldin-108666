The sauce is quite runny. I used dried coconut instead of the real one. It has a very good flavor.

This was a nice recipe. I cooked it Saturday. Served it to guests Sunday and just had it again tonight for my husband and me alone. My husband loves it!! While cooking it I found it very bland - and really added much more of all the spices, salt and also added freshly ground coriander seeds to add character. My guests ate double portions! I made a side dish of indian garam marsala eggplant, tomatoes and potatoes and various asian hors d'oervres. Was a big success. It really gets better the longer it has been sitting.
