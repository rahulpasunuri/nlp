I didn't feel like breaking out the pressure cooker so I braised instead at 200 for 3 hours and 250 for 2 hours. I soaked the beans overnight as well. Even with these simplifications the dish was amazing. The lamb just falls off the shank.

This is becoming a "go-to" recipe for me. Super easy, delicious. The only thing that I have to add is that this recipe is actually better if made a day in advance. The flavors really seem to deepen overnight. I've even frozen the leftovers and used them a week or two later with excellent results.

I used flageolets soaked overnight and floured the lamb shanks before browning. Didn't have fresh rosemary, so used fresh thyme and mint. Other than that, I followed the recipe--shanks and beans were perfectly cooked after 30 minutes. (Presoaking helps!) I would suggest using the natural release method of releasing the pressure, rather than the quick release method used in the recipe. Quick release can toughen the meat and make the beans mushy.

Very easy and tasty but turned out a bit soupy. I would use less water next time. I did soak beans overnight and they turned out just right at 45 mins, soft but not mushy. I don't think it would be as good in a slow cooker - I hate the way slow cookers give everything a uniform taste. With the pressure cooker, everything has its own distinct, delicious flavour.

Oh, I wanted to add to my review below that I added the tomatoes to my slow-cooker only during the last hour of cooking, once the beans were already tender. (The instructions that came with my slow-cooker said to add acidic ingredients at the end so the beans wouldn't get tough.)

Excellent recipe! We do not have a pressure cooker, so I made this in a slow-cooker instead and it turned out very yummy. I also used fresh instead of canned tomatoes (which made it slightly less flavorful, but it was because of a dinner guest's dietary restrictions). Other cuts of lamb work, too. We used lamb shoulder chops, as they were on sale at Whole Foods. The lamb fell off the bone, so ours ended up kind of like a lamb and white bean stew -- we served it with Italian country bread and butter. Yum!

This is an outstanding and simple recipe.Perhaps if "cook from Los Angeles" had not entered their 1 fork review 16 times, the fork rating for this recipe would be close to a 4, as it was the first time I used it. I soak my beans over night even though the pressure cooker instructions say that it's not necessary and I also use cubed lamb stew as the shanks are too sinewy and don't really provide a lot of meat (although delicious). The tastes harmonize fabulously. We love it.

Maybe I did something wrong but this turned out terrible for me. I pressure cooked for 45 minutes and the beans were actually fine. It was the lamb that was off. I buy all my meats from Whole Foods so I know I started with a quality cut. The lamb tasted poached, not cooked. Very odd, gamey taste and color. Perhaps I did something wrong though since I'm the only one who had this comment.

Made this recipe in a crock-pot. Substituted beef broth for the water and served over a bed of mashed potatoes with green beans. Delicious!

30 mins is not enough to cook the beans. 40 mins is not enough to cook the beans. The flavors go very well together but the ratios are just not right.

I used an 7qt All Clad slow cooker for this recipe, doubled the veggies, substituted 2 Italian Stew tomatoes in place of diced, reduced water to 2 cups. Seared meat in cooker insert, then briefly deglazed with roughly chopped veggies, then added tomatoes, water and beans. Set cooker to low for 8 hours. 15min work and lovely rustic stew with crunchy bread the first night, removed remaining meat from bones, brief chop in food processor, voila, the leftovers became pasta dinner the next night.

This was absolutely delicious. The blended flavors seasoning the beans i believe could only happen in a pressure cooker environment. I amde no modifications in the recipe. Only problem is the pressures cooker cna't accomodate a big party - so I will probably try this in a big dutch oven on brew for three hours in the oven. Let's see if the beans can be as good.

I forgot to give it 4 stars. I would give it 5 if I could. Even my husband who normally doesn't like slow cooked food, had seconds.

I LOVE lamb shanks and I LOVE my pressure cooker and what a great combination they make. This recipe is fantastic. The meat falls off of the bone and mixes beautifully with the other ingredients. I soaked the beans over night and they were still a bit hard after cooking, so I brought it back up to pressure and cooked for about 5-10 minutes and did a quick release. I always refrigerate things like this over night and skim off the fat. The flavors have a chance to meld and it takes much better than it does if eaten right away... although it it still good if eaten right after making it.

I am an experienced cook who has used a pressure cooker successfully for many years. This recipe just did not work for me. I cooked everything for 45 mins. then opened the pot and checked the beans (I used Great Northern small white beans as I did not have navy beans). They were still hard. Another 30 mins. and the lamb was falling off the bone but the beans were STILL undercooked. I liked the flavor of the lamb, but it was no better than many of my slow cooker recipes. For me, not a keeper.

Have not made this yet, but plan on it. SOme observations from reading the reviews. I would suggest soaking the beans first. Also, as a food scientist and someone who grew up eating pinto beans for dinner 3-4 times a week, I can attest to the fact that adding salt at the beginning does not harden the beans. In fact, you want to do it, otherwise it's hard to get the salt level right.

Excellent! This was my first foray in to pressure cooking. I took the advice from other reviews and let it cook 45 minutes after the pressure cooker reached a good pressure level. The beans were perfectly done. Fantastic flavor and it couldn't have been easier!

Followed the recipe exactly but it needed another 20 minutes in the pressure cooker because the meat was still not tender enough and the beans were still too hard. Topped Parmigiano Reggiano, splash of olive oil and parsley as suggested. I doubled the recipe for left overs and it was even better the next day! Perfect for a cold rainy winter weekend.

Delicious! I used flagelot beans as that was what I had on hand. I wouldn't change a thing!

Great flavors. I doubled the garlic and used 1 cup red wine and chicken stock instead of water. Could cook for 35-40 minutes to make the beans and meat more tender.

We loved this dish, but I made a lot of changes. We don't have a pressure cooker, so I braised the lamb for 2.5 hours (no beans) with all the veggies as well as adding white wine, tomato paste and a little white wine vinegar. Then I strained our all the solids and added them all to the "Fagioli All'uccellettoto" recipe also on this site (to replace the beans called for in this recipe) I followed this other recipe, except to add a little sugar. After combining the lamb and veggies to the white beans I added salt, pepper, parmesan and lemon juice to taste.

This is a great recipe! It took about 45 minutes for the beans to cook. It's fine to add salt to the beans when cooking, it's an old wives tale that salt "toughens" beans.

We made this for dinner last week. Our lamb shanks were too big to fit into the pressure cooker, so my poor husband had to cut them with a hacksaw (we don't have a cleaver). It was well worth the effort--very tasty and satisfying. The one complaint I had was it came out a little too soupy for my taste, so next time I will use less liquid. We also used broth instead of water for better flavor.

This recipe has officially made it into my weekly rotation -- so quick, easy and good! Last night I was in a hurry, so I didn't brown the meat or saute the veggies; I just threw it all in the pressure cooker at once and it still turned out great. I would only say that when cooking beans, one should always add salt and tomatoes at the end to avoid tough beans. I'm a little surprised that the person who developed this recipe missed that point....

what do you use if you don't have a pressure cooker? crock pot or dutch oven?

Very good, but next time, I will soak the navy beans before cooking. They were still very hard after 30 minutes and I had to put them under pressure for an additional hour.

Since I did not have a pressure cooker, I just let the lamb shanks braise for about 2 1/2 hours. It was wonderful and very tasty. I did add some white wine to deglaze the pan.

I was unable to find lamb shanks so I used the small lamb chops my supermarket regularly carries. We were short on white beans so I added about 1/4c barley with the beans. What a great recipe! Fast and delicious.
