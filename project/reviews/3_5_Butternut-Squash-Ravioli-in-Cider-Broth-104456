Delicious! I used twice as much butternut squash and adjusted the spices accordingly. Next time I will just use less ricotta. I made with homemade pasta dough for a ravioli party, and these were the best there! I have extra filling and plan to use it in a lasagna. It was even good just on a cracker. A slightly sweet flavor, and the ricotta gave a less mushy consistency than traditional squash ravioli. I will definitely make these again.

Wow - the sauce is amazing! We added guanciale for flavor as per some other reviewers and this added a nice dimension. Also, changed the proportions in favor of the chicken broth + a splash of half and half.

We used these ravioli as a starter for a vegetarian holiday meal. They were a big hit with our guests. We made them mid afternoon and refrigerated them on wax paper on cookie sheets with no problems. The making process was made much easier by a little plastic dumpling press we picked up in Chinatown for about two bucks. It gave a really strong seal AND let us trim offer the extra wonton wrapper with kitchen shears. This made lighter more uniform ravioli. We served with tuffled browned butter and a generous fresh parsley garnish instead of the cider broth. We'll definitely do this recipe again, but next time I might try increasing the squash and decreasing the ricotta just a bit for a stronger vegetable flavor.

Just a heads up, if you live in the northeast and have a Wegman's... I had the brilliant idea to try using Wegman's fresh pasta lasagna sheets for these ravioli. Bad idea, they're too stiff, they don't stretch to hold the filling, and they wouldn't seal either. I wound up calling an italian restaurant who makes their own pasta and begging to buy some pasta. It worked! Lovely dinner!

used wonton wraps and substituted mascarpone for ricotta. No parmesan. Quickly fried in oil/sage. served with balsamic dressed salad and carmelized pecans. A hit!

I was surprised just how much I enjoyed the cider broth. It was refined and delicious. However, I used lots of advice from the reviews and made some changes. I also used ravioli from a local pasta maker. For the sauce I cut the amount of cider almost in half and added a 1/4 cup of cream at the end. I also pan fried the ravioli (after a brief boil) in butter, oil and sage. I added walnuts to the pan fry the last couple of minutes. Really turned out to be a great dish.

Made this for a vegetarian dinner party. The ravioli get 4 forks, made them the night before and froze them on a cookie sheet. The sauce gets a rating of 1: too thin and too sweet. I'll make another sauce next time.

I had some butternut squash ravioli I purchased from an Italian market (made on their premises) and this sauce went perfectly with it. So simple and so delicious and so many fewer calories than a cream sauce. It may have taken all of 15 minutes from start to the first delectable bite!

I find this recipe delightful. The lightness of the sauce nicely balances the richness of the squash/cheese mixture. I have even used this filling in rigatoni pasta - fill and freeze and they reheat nicely in the microwave along with the sauce. Wonderful to have on hand for a gourmet quick meal.

I went the extra step to make my own pasta dough and it was really worth it. The ravioli filling and broth were a great mix of savory and sweet. Next time I may add a bit of cream to thicken up the sauce. As a vegetarian, this would make a great main dish in the fall/winter.

I forgot to mention that I didn't read the recipe before I roasted the squash so none of the sugar or maple syrup made it in there for the roasting process.

Seriously delicious. I used round pot sticker wrappers to save time. I ended up serving them with a brown butter instead of the broth, but will definitely try the broth next time. They were really rich with the butter. The texture and flavor of the filling was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to share these with more friends and family.

Much better if you lightly pan fry them. Did both boiling them and pan frying them and the crunch with the pan fry is worth the extra oil.

Only made the ravioli - not the bvroth. Thought they would be sweeter than they were. Good but not amazing.

Rating: 3
Delicious and full of flavor, but quite sweet! I added a touch of half-and-half to the sauce as well as some browned maple sausage to attain a more savory flavor and some toasted almonds on top for texture. I had added some pancetta to the filling, but I think it got lost in the strong flavor of the squash.

This dish would have been four forks.. because the dish tasted fabulous, however it took me and my husband 3 hours from start to finish on this dish. Roasting the squash was easy and filled the house with a wonderful aroma, but once we had to fill and boil all those little ravioli.. that was a little too much. Next time we will find a way to make them ahead of time so as to make the process go faster. But as I said, it tasted fantastic. Add dried cranberries to the broth towards the end.

Very easy pasta sauce, and quite good. I mostly make red sauces, so it was fun to experiment with a cream and wine-based sauce. I doubled the recipe and it came out fine, although I did add a tablespoon of flour at the end and simmer the sauce for at least ten minutes longer than the recipe calls for. This thickened it up nicely, reduced the wine flavor, and with some salt and pepper it really came together. I didn't have any leftover sage, so I topped with a little fresh italian parsley, plus the pecans and cheese. Served with a pumpkin and squash ravioli, and it was great - lets the ravioli flavors stand out, but adds a nice component of its own.

Excellent, definitely worth making again or in a larger batch for the freezer. I took the time to make my own fresh pasta dough and was well-rewarded. Definitely a new favorite to add to my repertoire.

I love this dish, but it is much better with homemade pasta. The quality of the cider makes a HUGE difference. It is best with an early tart cider, late cider or cider made from drops makes it too sweet. Find a good tart cider and try it, you will be amazed.

I did something slightly different with this dish. We were making lamb turnovers and wanted a vegetarian alternative, so I used the ravioli filling from this recipe and put it in puff pastry (available in the frozen section). We made small triangles stuffed with this butternut squash filling and they were a huge hit. Even the toddlers at the party loved them.

We did not make the broth, used brown butter and crispy sage sauce instead since I did not have apple cider on hand. The ravioli were amazing! We used leftover gyoza wrappers from making beet ravioli with poppy seeds, also on this site. We're now huge fans of making our own ravioli! Do try this at home! Sprinkle some flour on the finished ravioli to keep them from sticking before you cook.

Hummmm.. I have a completely different opinion than the other reviewers. I loved the raviolis and agree that homemade pasta would put them over the top. The broth however was way to sweet for my taste. I think I would prefer the raviolis with sage butter.

I actually skipped the ravioli part and bought fresh pumpkin ravioli at a gourment food store. I can say with certainty, however, that the sauce is fabulous. I highly recommend adding bits of sauteed and carmelized butternut squash to it.

I found this to be pretty labor intensive, even with wonton wrappers. And I def. don't think I would use the store-bought wrappers again, they were...eh, just not that great. With homeade pasta dough, it would be superb. All the flavors are good, the whole process just takes awhile and dirties up a bunch of dishes. Phew.

We made this for an early fall "shabbat-luck" and it impressed everyone, including us. The potsticker wrappers are a stroke of genius, especially since my partner and I have one of those little dumpling-presses that you can sometimes find at Asian groceries. The whole dish was remarkably sweet, almost dessert-like; I substituted a Tbsp or two of nutritional yeast flakes for the parmesan. Do not, whatever you do, just stack finished ravioli on top of each other in a bowl; by the time I was finished forming all of the ravioli, the filling had soaked through the bottom 5-10, making them too gooey to pry apart. Then again, you could transform this into an interesting lasagna if you boiled the potsticker wrappers first...

My family loved this. I made it twice, using wonton wrppers both times. I thought the broth could use more cider, so the second time, I used 1 cup cidar and 1 cup stock. That was a little too sweet, so maybe 1-1/4 c. stock and 3/4 cup cider?

I am fortunate to have an excellent fresh pasta vendor at the local farmer's market. I made the sauce to go with purchased winter squash ravioli. Yum!

Rating: 2
I had to try this recipe after having this in various restaurants and loved it. This is not hard to make or that time consuming. Since gyoza wrappers are on the light side I would stick to using this as an appetizer or try pasta next time. The cider makes this sauce too sweet. I added more stock and a touch of cream which did the trick. If I make this again I will try a walnut sauce intead. Note...my picky eaters weren't fans.

I would absolutely go to the extra effort of making the homemade pasta. These were pretty good, however, the broth did not wow me, as the other reviewers suggested it would. The ravioli were fine, but only that. I, too, substituted honey for the maple syrup and it was very subtle, yet pleasing.

This recipe was very good although time consuming. I would add more salt and cut back on the cinnamon next time. The broth was awesome. Made homemade pasta and it turned out well but again, was time consuimg. I will probably make this again but may try some other recipes first

I served this as an appetizer for new year's eve last year. Everyone at the table was AMAZED! We like to think we have some awesome new year's eve dinners and this fit right in!!

Very timing consuming - be sure to plan appropriately. I used homemade dough from a local bakery - wait for them to float before dumping the water - 1 to 2 minutes doesn't do it -a hard lesson to learn. Also - I will use less ricotta cheese - the flavor of the butternut squash is so wonderful. The broth is delish.

I find myself thinking about this dish at random times. That is clear indication of its scrumptiousness. It has a very delicate taste and would be a great appetizer or main dish for a spring lunch. Be sure to use real apple cidar and don't cook the ravioli too long. It is almost like a soup.

A lot of work per bite but worth it. The next day we had the leftovers and added the juice of one orange to the sauce. That pushed it over the top! Next time homemade pasta and add the orange.

Made a variation. Am not experienced with my own pasta and messed up dough, so I made something different for the dinner I was cooking. Had all of the filling made and was in the process of making hors douevers for a party. Cut circles out of Pillsbury ready made pie crust dough and put this filling between circles of the dough. Baked it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes (brushed with egg wash) and it makes a great appetizer.

This is such a wonderful recipe. It has so many different flavors with the ricotta and apple cider. This is one of my favorite recipes and i've only used the wonton wrappers and have had nothing but success.

This is one of the best ravioli dishes I've ever had. I thought the cinnamon and maple syrup might be too strong so I substituted ginger and nutmeg for the cinnamon and an Australian honey for the maple syrup. The results were incredible and my guests at a recent dinner party raved. I will, however, make my own pasta next time since the won ton wrappers I used were kind of gummy.

Rating: 3
This was a unique dish. I would probably classify it as an impress your guests first course dish. I probably wouldn't make this for my family too often...if ever again. I agree, this dish would be put over the top with homemade pasta rather than the won ton wraps.

Rating: 3
I think the best thing about this dish is the broth. Who would think that cider, chicken stock, and shallots would be so good? For the ravioli, I used wonton wrappers. It probably would have been better w/ fresh pasta, but the wrappers were so easy. I also made the filling two days before and kept in the fridge. I added a little blue cheese and some toasted pecans to the filling for a little more depth. Makes a very "picture-perfect" dinner.

Fun and interesting twist to traditional ravioli fillings. I substituted acorn squash because they looked better at the market. Eggwash worked great-no problems with separating during cooking. The ravioli came out too sweet for us, so next time I will use less sugar and syrup; however, my husband, who is not a fan of sweetness or squash, actually ate them happily! These would make a nice side for our next dinner gathering, seeing as how the work can largely be done ahead of time. Will definitely make again.

This was a very tasty recipe. I used a lightly beaten egg to keep the wonton wrappers together instead of water. The ravioli came out wonderfully.

This dish is easy to prepare and delicious. However, I used the gyoza wrappers and the ravioli clumped together and did not hold its form in the broth. Perhaps using fresh pasta would be a better choice?

My parents made this as part of our Christmas dinner. It was fabulous. They actually made homemade pasta with their pasta machine. I tried to duplicate this with won-ton wrappers and it was horrible! I couldn't find potsticker wrappers. I will definitely make this again but i well make the ravioli noodles myself. The broth is yummy!

This was a big hit at our Christmas dinner. I prepared the ravioli ahead of time using round potsticker wrappers. My nephew had such a great time stirring the broth and dropping the raviolis into the water. I had to convince him to sit and eat instead of cooking! Everybody loved it.

Delicious, the cider gave the sauce an elusive sweetness that was better than I thought it would be.
