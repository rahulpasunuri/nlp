I got the same flavor after toasting fennel seeds. I added the meat to the pan with the toasted seeds and onion.

This is a great recipe for a weeknight dinner.

Follow directions-instead of sweet sausage used spicy with addition of one clove of garlic. Used fresh parpadell pasta, highly recommend.

I didn't have white wine or marinara sauce, so I substituted canned chicken broth for the wine and some canned whole tomatoes (with some juice) for the marinara. I also halved the recipe. While I wouldn't recommend halving it - you end up with too little liquid - it still tasted great. Very very easy to cook, quick, and delicious. Definitely making it again.

Hands down my favorite meat sauce pasta. Use spicy Italian sausage and Ragu original sauce to make this awesome dish. All of my friends rave about it!

Not a big fan of the fennel in this dish... I like this one best: http://joelsfoodblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/whole-roasted-tomato-and-sausage.html

The key to this dish is definitely NOT using jarred marinara sauce. Just chop a can of whole peeled tomatoes and throw it in there with a little garlic, s&p. delish!

We loved this dish, but instead of using a prepared marinara sauce, I used 2 cups of La Bella San Marzano tomatoes (italian canned plum tomatoes). I sliced up the whole tomato pieces, put them back with the juice, and ladled 2 cups of the juice/tomato piece mixture into the pan. Added salt and pepper to taste. Also instead of chopping the fennel and onion, I sliced them very thinly, and they sauteed beautifully. Very flavorful, and the fennel was not overwhelmed.

Boring...I love fennel but it can't compete with Marinara sauce. I kept adding things to make this recipe just OK. Added fennel seed and red pepper flakes which helped some. I would like this recipe better if I had used Hot Sausage with lots of fennel in it.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but when we actually ate it it was just too many flavors. The fennel was drowned out by the marinara -- the sauce tying everything together should be much milder.

I'm still full the following day after making this last night. Quite a hearty dish. And, we thought it was good. The flavor is just what you'd expect from the ingredient list. The orange/radish salad was a nice accompaniment.

This recipie is in high rotation for dinner in our home. I like it best with Mario Batali's (buy at Trader Joe's) jarred fennel tomato sauce. I have used other sauces and its still good just not quite as good.

I only say I wouldn't make this again because I wouldn't precisely follow the recipe. The sauce was really good, except that the marinara (Verde brand) overwhelmed the fennel. So next time I'd use either fennel or marinara but not both. Plus, once the sauce got tossed with the pasta, all we had was red pasta. Next time I'll serve about a cup of pasta per person and pour the sauce on top.

OMG, this was so good that I actually wanted to take it for lunch the next day! If you like fennel as much as I, than I would recommend using a bit more chopped stalks on top. The two tablespoons garnish was just not enough. The combination of cool and crunchy on top of the hot pasta was amazing. Truly one of the best recipes from Gorumet that I've had.

Fantastic! Enough said.

My roommates rated this one of the best dishes I've made this year! It is super easy, wonderful for late dinners after work, and tastes superb. You don't need more than 2 cups of marinara sauce (I used a jar from the store)--toss the fennel/sausage ragu with the pasta to avoid "swimming in sauce" phenomenon.

We loved this recipe!! Instead of adding the sausage into the saute pan to cook, my husband grilled the sausage. I added some garlic to the saute because we love garlic. This has turned into one of our favorite quick dinners.

I was disappointed. The marinara sauce,made from an Epicurious recipe,overwhelmed the flavour of the fennel and the Italian sausage. The finished dish was more pasta with marinara sauce,not at all what we expected

Hard to believe that something this easy to put together could come out so good. Made for a big crowd and everybody loved it. I cut sausage into bite sized pieces and pre-cooked before adding back into vegetables.

Quick and easy...my kids gobbled it up and asked for more. That makes it a keeper at our house!

I was on the verge of cancelling my subscription to Gourmet on the principle of their new column that features "convenience foods". And then I made this for a superbowl party. It doubled beautifully. People had thirds. I made it again for a casual dinner. All the males had thirds. Sooooo easy and soooooo good.
