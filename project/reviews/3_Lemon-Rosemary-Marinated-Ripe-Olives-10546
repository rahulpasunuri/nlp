This adds a surprising amount of character to ripe olives, but they're too soft. I wouldn't make this again because I just prefer good quality olives with the pits and because the nutty character of ripe olives is lost here. They're good, though.

when this recipe first came out, it was from a story on making food gifts for christmas. We made them then, ate some, gave others away. My wife recently (now almost 10 years later) asked me to make them again! And they were just as memorable...
