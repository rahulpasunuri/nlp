ok, I haven't made this recipe, but ACK! How can you throw saffron into water and then drain?? That's some precious stuff, and such a delicate taste. If anyone thinks this is missing 'something,' maybe try wrapping the saffron threads in a bit of foil, pan roasting it lightly until the aroma is noticeable, and crushing the threads with some of the hot liquid, then adding it to the sauce. This is how I use saffron in paella. The full flavor comes out, and you definitely don't throw it away with cooking liquid.

This dish needs some serious help. You're better looking for some other recipe with pasta and shrimp.

Adjustments: 6 garlic cloves, minced; 16 ozs crabmeat (canned, from New Zealand); 3 teaspoons curry powder, one Thai hot chili minced. Finally, 20 whole shrimp added and cooked through just before serving, as well as a splash of Pernod.

Made this Friday night - it was just "ok" - not good for a main dish - got to be a little much with the strong curry tast. Came out little watery too - but, needed that to keep the angel hair moist.

This dish was "ok". I followed the recipe and did not change anything...but I would next time! (Although I don't think there will be a next time) Adding the shrimp at the suggested time in the recipe leaves you with some terribly overcooked and rubbery shrimp. I suggest taking them out of the pan after briefly sauteeing them and adding them back during the final minute or two, while waiting for the sauce to thicken. My husband and I agreed that while the sauce was simple and edible, it lacked 'something'?????

Excellent, will make this one again. 'Threw in some frozen peas per previous review comments about it needing vegetables and had trouble getting the sauce thickened but end result was terrific. Just the right amount of curry.

I liked this! I did add some sugar snap peas,red pepper & sliced baby carrot-it needed vegs & color. I left out the cream & found that it was thick enough. I also doubled the amount of crab used.

I really liked this. I followed one of the reviewers comments and served it over rice and it was really good. I also added diced asparagus to the seafood mixture which I think complimented it really well. I used small, cooked shrimp instead of uncooked jumbo shrimp and I left out the crab. Because the shrimp was already cooked, I added it much later in the process so it wouldn't get chewy. I also waiting to add the asparagus near the end since it too cooks quickly. As for the rice, I added saffron and cardomon seeds. It was very tasty.

No problems here thickening the sauce. I think I would have preferred this with some vegs - maybe green peas, or something to add some color. I think I also would prefer the dish over rice. Overall, it was enjoyable and very fast to prepare.

Excellent, easy pasta. I used canned crab and jumbo shrimp. Only thing to watch is that the cooking time is way too short in the instructions. This sauce needs more simmering time to be the right thickness.

I thought that this dish was excellent but was disappointed by the way the curry masked the flavor of the crab. Next time I would use half the amount of curry, forget the crab and use one pound of large shrimp, whole. Crab is better on its own.

I made the recipe exactly except used only shrimp because I had it on hand. It was delicious and next time we will try shrimp and Dungenes crab.

Made this for a small dinner party and it was a hit. Used half the amount of curry powder, and it was wondeful. The saffron in the pasta water gave a wonderful pale yellow glow to the angel hair. I served this with a small portion of grilled salmon topped with a grilled shrimp garnish. It was terrific!

I also found the sauce to be a little thin and will probably add more cornstarch next time.

Made this in a pinch. Meaning I didn't have all the ingredients. I used the imitation crabmeat for the fish, didn't use the saffron and used about 1/2 the curry it suggested. I loved it! My husband wasn't as thrilled about it. Found out he isn't a big curry fan. Oh, well. I enjoyed it!

Using half of curry worked better for me.

This was delicious and I would definately make this again! Instead of using all the heavy whipping cream, I used half whipping cream and half skim milk. Add extra corn starch if not using full amount of cream because sauce needed to be thicker!

The flavor of this recipe is superb but I would prefer to use regular spaghetti (#8) or better yet linguine (#17). "Angel Hair" pasta is too thin and tries to form steaky portions instead of loose pasta for a better look when serving.
