It is certainly true that you can feel free to use whatever is on hand. I didn't have time to get any wheat berries, so I used 1C of freshly made brown rice which I mixed with 2C of leftover bulgur (cooked in chicken broth with some sauteed chopped onion, ground cumin and coriander). For the Herb Sauce I used basil, rosemary, mint, parsley and coriander. The main substitutions were in the vegetables I used because this could not be called "summer vegetable" stir fry the way I made it! I had some leftover kale and once I chopped that with one baby bok choy, I had 3C of chopped vegetables. So I only added one medium zucchini, one small green pepper, one carrot, and 5-6 radishes and cherry tomatoes. Absolutely wonderful.

This dish is WONDERFUL! So flavorful and fresh, healthy tasting, but not healthy tasting in a bad way if you know what I mean. Lol. My husband who isnt very adventurous with food absolutely loved this dish. Gobbled up all of it and took leftovers for lunch the next day - as did I. I made it with whole grain brown rice instead of wheat berries. Instead of toasting the wheat berries, I chopped about a 1/8 cup of almonds and toasted them instead of the Wheat berries. The flavor and crunch from the almonds was the perfect addition to the dish. The vegetables I used were eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, radishes, crimini mushrooms (addition), and fingerling potatoes (addition, but I don't recommend the potatoes - the flavor didn't go well. I won't add them the next time I make this dish.). And the herbs I used were basil, mint, and tarragon.

This is great, and I'm looking forward to trying it in other combinations. I made the herb sauce with cilantro and didn't love it on it's own but it tasted great in combination with the vegetables and brown rice. I used extra vegetables and sauce in an omelet the next day, fantastic!

I used wheat berries as mentioned in the recipe and this was amazing! I don't know what one of the reviewers was talking about when they mentioned this being bland but it is anything but. I didn't have rice on hand but this would be equally delicious with rice. The herb sauce is excellent and gives a nice pop. For the vegetables I used a combination of broccoli, carrots, red bell pepper, chinese celery cabbage and crimini mushrooms. The only change I made was to add a little ginger and garlic to the vegetable stir-fry. Other than that I followed this exactly and it was to die for. I could eat this once or twice a week for dinner and be completely content :)

I have been making recipes from this site for over 10 years and this is my first review. This is borderline inedible. Bland, and that is the best thing about it!

Quick, easy, and fresh. Made it with jasmine rice for my girlfriend and she loved it...the vinegar in the sauce gives it a great kick! You can use pretty much any veggie - I stir-fried mine all at the same time, controlling cooking duration by varying how thick I sliced the different veggies. Carrots were thin, eggplant was thicker... FOr a little changeup to the weeknight meal routine, this works great.

I made this recipe because it fit the nutritional guidelines of for my sister who has gallstone issues. I was not looking forward to it and in fact asked my husband to grab a pizza on the way home as "back up". The pizza never saw the light of day. This meal was fabulous! Surprisingly, it's the herb dressing that absolutely brings it from 3 stars to 4. I don't know how it all works: I don't like basil, my sister doesn't like cilantro, and yet ... we were wishing we had more herb sauce to pour over the top! Also, the long grain, organic brown rice I used was super good: chewy and sweet and nutty. I'm going to start using it more frequently. This recipe is going into rotation!

Wow! We loved this! So fresh. For the veg, we used zucchini, squash, radishes, celery, carrots, yellow and red peppers, and cherry tomatoes. For the herbs: cilantro, flat leaf parsley, mint, a little basil, and a little celery leaves. We used jasmine rice because that's what my husband loves. He just told me he'd be happy eating that 2 times a week!!
