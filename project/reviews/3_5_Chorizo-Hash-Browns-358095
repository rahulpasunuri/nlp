@Cook in India, I have not actually made this yet, but I have prepared similar recipes, and I wanted to reply to your question. Were I making this for a vegetarian crowd, especially being in India, I'd probably dust some paneer cubes with hot, smoked paprika and/or chilli powder along with maybe some ground sage. I'd then fry it up and add as I would the chorizo.

This was pretty good and light. I'm single so I used one large russet potato and two chorizo links. didn't saute the onions and garlic...just mixed them in with the potatoes and chorizo. I was able to make them into 4 large patties. I baked them in the oven on a foil lined pan I coated with cooking spray on about 450 for 30 minutes...Changed the oven to Broil in the last 10 minutes. I mistakenly added a little too much salt to the mixture. Will just use a dash next time. I got fresh made chorizo from Central Market and I didn't know there was almost no fat in the meat. All in all I was able to make this pretty healthy and enjoyed with a couple of egg whites. Imagine getting 4 serving from using just 1 large potato.

Great overall recipe. I omitted the small onion and substituted chorizo for linguica sausage due to the lack of fresh chorizo at the supermarket. Instead of sauteing the onion and garlic first, I put the scallions and garlic into the potato/sausage mixture and cooked all ingredients together. This made the dish more flavorful. Also, don't forget to soak the fresh grated potatoes in ice water for at least 10 minutes. This shocks the potatoes, makes them more crispy, so to say, and prevents them from discoloration. Enjoy!

My family really liked this though I found it a little bland. I definitely think that more sausage would make it more satisfying. Serve with eggs to make a complete meal.

This was very good I did use alot of chorizo for a more spice. Easy to throw in any extras you want, but the chirizo makes it.

Made this with a few changes (only because i did not have some ingredients): * no scallions * no chorizo * used dried parsley instead Came out amazing. I upped the garlic to one BIG clove and used smoked paprika instead of regular. Cooked each side on slightly high heat so that it got nice & crispy. Delicious & Easy, I'd really like to try it with the chorizo!
