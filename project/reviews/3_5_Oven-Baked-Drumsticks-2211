I'm not big on exact measurements, but I make a similar dish that my kid loves. I marinate the drumsticks in just enough BBQ sauce to coat them for a couple of hours (I use President's Choice Chipotle sauce, but any favourite recipe would work) and then dredge them in a mix of dry bread crumbs, paprika, oregano, cayenne, garlic powder and black pepper, then bake on a foil-lined, greased sheet for about 25-35 minutes at 350F, depending on the size, turning them mid-way through the cooking. I have no idea what kind of jumbo mutant chicken drums could possibly need a whole hour in the oven! There is no need for so much salt and butter if you have enough other spices!

I thought this was delicious! I made this almost exactly as instructed. The only change I made was using almond meal instead of breadcrumbs because I follow the paleo diet. Turned out wonderfully!

I made this because I had some drumsticks leftover and didn't know what to do with them. They turned out okay, but weren't anything special. The butter-mustard mixture didn't hold its emulsion and I had to keep whisking it between dips, else all of the mustard sank to the bottom. Maybe the egg other people wrote about helps with that, but I didn't read all of the reviews. All of the special flavor ends up in that breading, which you don't get to taste at all if you peel the skin off. (Next time, I'd choose skinless drumsticks, but I was too lazy and unskilled to take the skin off tonight.) That's my chief complaint. Only baked these for about 45 minutes because they were small. I have another recipe that I made with other drumsticks from this pack that only baked for 30 minutes so an horu seemed like overkill.

I would definately decrease the amount of butter as it came out rather soggy from the excess fat. There are many better oven fried chicken recipes on this website.

I followed the recipe exactly using the drumsticks as suggested. Next time I try this recipe I would like to try boneless, skinless chicken pieces instead of the drumsticks. I would also reduce the amount of butter used as there was a lot of fat sitting in the pan.

These were excellent, but I'm not sure why the previous poster mentioned rye bread. I used plain white bread. I also needed to bake for an hour and a half instead of 1 hour (my drumsticks were pretty large). Family loved this.

This was excellent! You need to follow the recipe exactly, including the day old rye bread. This is a favourite in our family.

This was okay. I cut back on the butter and salt, and ended up with a ton of leftover crumb mix. The chicken was tender and moist. Nothing special here, but pretty good for a weeknight dinner.

This recipe came out great. The chicken was very moist and had a nice crunchy skin. I also just used butter and mustard and did not add eggs as some of the other cooks did. I think it came out great without the eggs.

sorry to be in the minority, but this was just so-so. it tasted alright, but nothing about it made me want to make it again, as written. texture was good, and meat was juicy - i also left the skin on. but i think i can find some better drumstick recipes

I replaced the butter with non-fat milk and the chicken was wonderful. I'm sure it would be even better with the butter, but without all that fat it was moist, tasty and I will definitely make it again.

Excellent! I will definately be making this again! I followed a tip from one of the reviewers and added an egg to replace some of the butter. I don't think it would have turned out otherwise. The chicken was extremely tender.

I made this recipe for dinner last night, what a hit!! I have two teenagers, did'nt even speak, to busy eating.... I made it with garlic mashed potatoes. This recipe will get used again !!

Delicious!!! Followed another reviewer's advice and used only 1/4 c butter and two eggs. The chicken was very moist but still had the nice butter flavor. The combination of spices was delicious. I was cooking for my in-laws who don't like Dijon mustard (can you imagine???) so I used only 2 T mustard and a splash, maybe 1/4 cup, of white wine to make up the other liquid. The mustard was very subtle, but delicious. I wonder if it might overpower the other spices if I had used the full amount. It only took about 45 minutes to bake instead of the hour called for. I served it with the "Rice with Spinach and Feta" recipe from Epicurious. It was such and easy meal to fix and everyone just raved about it. Oh, I had some Asiago cheese that I needed to use up so used it instead of Parmesan. It was really good!

Really good, was just as good cold the next day as well. Lots of alternatives here, different herbs + spices etc. One comment about the pepper - use fresh cracked mixed peppercorns ... very nice.

This is some of the best chicken I have ever made, baked or fried. Really delicious. I think the parmesan cheese is what did it.

I made this recipe but substituted a couple of eggs for the butter to lessen the fat content. Very good results. Tasty. Would definitely make it again.

Everyone loved the chicken from my 3 year old son through my wife to my 62 year old mother! My mother can't eat seeds so I replaced the Dijon mustard with mustard powder. This recipe is very flexible. I didn't have Paprika so I put in a mixture for grilling chicken. I didn't have any onion powder so I added some garlic powder. Great base recipe!

Not bad. Great flavor, but it came out pretty oily. That said, the leavings on the bottom of the pan are worthy of sopping up with bread or rice when nobody's looking. Next time I'll skip the butter altogether. Also, I think this breading would go very well with pork chops. Oh yeah, I also want to add some heat with cayenne or other chile next time. If you do it first, let me know how it turns out!

Very tasty, and as someone else pointed out you can make extras to freeze for another meal. I used only half the butter and will probably cut it down even more next time. Also removed the skin from the chicken first and was pleased that it stayed very juicy anyway.

Delicious--My guests raved about it. I only needed about half the butter & dijon mixture the recipe called for.

This recipe seemed strange at first but the end result is delicious. I made a whole bunch and froze them for later, my boys loved them!
