A single onion makes for a very sophisticated side dish, but I have a few suggestions: 1. Onions are still too crunchy and hard to digest. Steam the onions on the stovetop for 5-6 minutes to soften them, then bake. (I discovered this when I microwaved the leftovers in saranwrap. The steam softened the onions.) 2. Cover the onions with foil because the tips tend to burn, even at 350°. 3. Use oil instead of butter to get into the crannies of the onions. Sprinkle the fresh herbs on only at the end. 4. Use smaller onions for a smaller servings. People aren't used to eating ONLY an onion, and I was quickly overwhelmed by the pure onion-ness. Perhaps this dish should be one of two side dishes, or an edible garnish, instead of a full side dish.

Very tasty and presents beautifully. I fould that the onions present even better with 8 cuts (rather than 6), making sort of a pinwheel of alternating smaller and large portions. I removed 4 smaller sections with a paring knife and left the 4 larger ones to give even more of a "flower petal" look.

These were really good and made a nice presentation next to some filet mignon.
