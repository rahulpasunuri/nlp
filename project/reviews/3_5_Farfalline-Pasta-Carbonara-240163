I had a craving for carbonara, and found this one- I was looking for simple, never having made it before, and only having had it one other time, last year in Rome. This didn't disappoint, and my partner who is not into eggy things at all loved it. I did use some awesome nitrate-free ham, and a very good parmesan, but didn't do the peas, we didn't have any. A trick to get the right consistency, but the flavor was great.

This recipe was amazing! We added heavy cream, because you can't go wrong with it, and a dash of beef broth. This added an amazing twist to this recipe.

Usually when i make carbonara at home i use only the egg whites and panchetta instead of bacon. I also mix the oil, egg yolks, and parmesean before mixing everything together and i don't use pasta water when thinning the eggs because of how cloudy the water is it does not provide a pleasant flavor. I would use my own recipe instead of this one

It's alright but kinda bland. I think overall there are many other recipes that are probably more flavorful and less fatty. I'll probably look for another carbonara recipe.

What an easy recipe to make! And the children loved it.

I pretty much added all the things other reviewers suggested: half-and-half to the eggs, garlic, splash of white wine, extra cheese, even a pat of butter. I also used leftover ham instead of bacon and added some broccoli. I still think it came out on the bland side, but my partner liked it a lot and it certainly helped use up all the holiday party leftovers. I give it points for that and for its quickness. Use lots of pepper.

i made a few changes to cut back on the fat. instead of using bacon i sauteed sliced garlic in some olive oil under very low heat, deglazed the pan with some white wine, and added this to the pasta and eggs mixture. instead of using whole eggs, i substituted two leftover eggyolks per egg (along with some pasta water, two eggyolks made enough sauce to coat loads of pasta, enough for two people). this is a keeper!

Points for EASY and convenient. Threw dinner together with items in pantry/fridge. Cut luncheon ham into thin strips before browning. Added touch of cream to eggs. Also, added small amount of reserved water to egg mixture before tossing with eggs, cooked ham and pasta so eggs didn't curdle. I found dish filling, but not too heavy.

Made this for a week night supper. Quick and easy. Used pancetta instead of bacon and a different kind of noodle. It was a little dry, but adding more pasta water made it creamy. It was a rich dish, so a little goes along way.

Easy recipe. I used ham steaks, cubed, instead of bacon for a little more chunk. I also added tomatoes and used more peas and cheese than suggested.

Tasty but very rich. Next time I will use only a little bacon grease for flavor, more than that was too much for me. I think I would cut back to 2-3 eggs for the same reason. I added some hot sauce because I thought this dish was a little bland without it.

I've tried plenty of carbonara recipes but thought this was very good. I added white wine and deglazed the pan with the pancetta bits.I added a bit more cheese and fresh parsley and do add a bit of the pasta water in increase "creaminess". True, cream and peas are not traditionally added but I thought this was very near dishes I have tried in some regions of Italy.

Very good, and quick. I was generous with the bacon.

The Romans make this recipe this way - no true carbonara includes peas, cream, garlic, tuna, or any of the other questionable additions mentioned. In the Amatrice hills, there are several related recipes - spaghetti all'Amatriciana includes tomatoes and no eggs, and Griciano-style pasta, which includes no eggs and includes only pancetta, pecorino romano, and olive oil.

I don't know about this recipe. I think it would be better without the eggs. Ive made a quick pasta with pancetta, peas and onions which is really good on its own. On the other hand, I also love to make a good classic carbonara with pancetta, brown organic eggs (2 whole eggs + 1 egg yolk), a mix of parmigiano reggiano and pecorino romano, and finally, lots of freshly ground pepper. Its so rich though, I only make it for lunch! One tip: I have found that the open pasta shapes, like rigatoni for example, distribute the heat much better and are therefore less likely to scramble the eggs in your sauce, as compared to spaghetti.

Although still really good, this recipe turned out a bit bland. Making it a second time, I increased the amount of bacon and cheese, and (following the suggestion of another reviewer) I put the mixed recipe back into a skillet for a few minutes prior to serving. This helped melt the cheese and make the dish a bit more creamy. I think next time I'll add a small amount of garlic too.

This recipe, without the peas, is authentic italian, which does NOT contain cream. I usually use thin spaghetti, but use other types of pasta as well. I have been making a version (without the peas) of this for years. I always put the drained, hot, cooked pasta into the pan with the bacon, drippings and a little pasta cooking water, keeps it from sticking, then add the eggs and cheese. Turn on the burner to low for a few minutes, stirring constantly, to cook the eggs a little. My husband would eat this once a week if I would make it. It is an easy weeknight supper.

This may or may not be good, but it's not even remotely carbonara.

This was a very easy recipe for a midweek dinner. I had the ingredients on hand and everyone enjoyed the dish.

try adding white wine to the egg and cheese mixture. Traditionally the wine and a bit of cream are a must for this recipe to really work. Trust me, i'm italian!!!

for years I have been making almost the same dish only substituting a can of tuna sauteed with onions and garlic in olive oil and some white wine for the bacon. delicious

To Audie7, classic carbonara does not have cream in it. So, yes it is very good and creamy without added cream.

The taste was excellent. Fair warning: I chickened out and used egg substitute because it's pasteurized...it scrambles much more easily than real eggs! Maybe I should have taken more care to temper, but scrambled or not, the flavor was excellent.

I played with the recipe a bit as well: I used slow-cooked eggs (140° for 40 minutes) instead of raw ones, since I love the creamy texture. I used prosciutto instead of bacon, since I was out of bacon), and I used whole-wheat spirals (same reason). It was simple and delicious, and not because of my substitutions. It's just a wonderful, easy, flexible recipe. I'll definitely make it again!

Surprised that there is not half and half or heavy cream for this recipe to serve as a thickening agent - anyone have any suggestions? Is it tasty the way that it is written?

I altered the directions and quantities slightly and came out with a great tasting sauce! I used all organic bits  but used one less egg than called for, and instead of putting the pasta straight into the egg mix, I added it with a slurp of its cooking water to the sauté pan with the crisp bacon (and its naughty fat). Then I added all that to the egg and cheese mixture& it was lovely  a gorgeous flavor bouquet. (normally Id put a touch of fresh nutmeg in there, but it didnt need it). Next time I might use less water as well.
