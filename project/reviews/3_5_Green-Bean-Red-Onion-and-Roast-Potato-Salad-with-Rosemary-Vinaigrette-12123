Made with balsamic vinegar, 3 cloves roasted garlic and 2 tsp Dijon mustard in the dressing, giving it a bit of zip.

I made this as written and was very disappointed - it was bland tasting; ended up throwing out most of it.

Delicious! I cut the fat in half by spaying the potatoes with Pam and roasting them on a non-stick cookie sheet. Adding a teaspoon of dijon mustard adds a nice taste.

I used what I had: white potatoes & oregano. It was still delicious. Because I'm not a fan of raw onions I tossed them in with the hot potatoes just to take the edge off.

I recently made this for a tailgate party at Citifield, perfect for serving room temperature. I don't like mayonnaise whatsoever, so I enjoyed this but it was a little bland/underseasoned. It needed more salt, cracked black pepper, dressing, and maybe next time I'd experiment with more herbs.

I made this because I needed a dish that was both vegan friendly and still good for a large group, It was very popular, but I left out the olives and it needed extra salt, I did take some one below's advice about making it well in advance, and it did very nice things to the flavors. I had the left overs for lunch and added goat cheese and it was great

I have been making green bean and potato salad for a long time...but I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try. DELICIOUS. Since then, I haven't gone back to making my old recipe. This dish always gets rave reviews (I do omit the olives, though).

This was good, but not fabulous, and a nice change from the regular mayo-based potato salad that we normally make. My husband would definitely eat it again, although I'd make some changes. The recipe makes a lot, so for 2 people, I'd cut the recipe to a quarter of the ingredients. The dressing was a bit watery even though I patted dry the green beans and onion very well. I would add more oil and a tablespoon or so of sugar or honey and substitute balsamic vinegar for half of the red wine vinegar. Also, next time, I would plunge the cooked green beans into ice water instead of just running cold water over them to keep the beans greener. Overall it was good but not sure it will become a staple of my recipe collection.

3.5 forks. Not "beyond compare", but an excellent dish the same. My adjustments: Used 2 lb.potatoes & 1.5 lb.green beans to the full complement of dressing. Used fresh rosemary, thyme, & basil, and about 1/3 of the vinegar quantity I made balsamic - very nice. Added a small handfull fresh garlic clove chunks (halved small cloves) to potatoes about half way through roasting. Got excellent reviews from vegetarian and non-veg guests alike~!

3.5 Forks. Not quite "beyond compare", but an excellent dish. My adjustments: I used 2 lb potatoes & 1.5 lb potatoes with full complement of dressing. I used a mix of fresh rosemary, thyme, and basil because I had them all - and it was not too much of anything. Added about 1/3 portion of balsamic to the quantity of vinegar. Added a small handfull of garlic cloves - cut into about 1/4 - to the potatoes about half way through roasting (just because we enjoy roast garlic). Had good reviews with vegetarian and non-veg guests alike.

Used fingerlings, extra garlic and white balsamic for the vinegar. Added a few extra ingredients from the pantry; pretty to look at and very tasty. The dressing was excellent.

This recipe also works w/Yukon Gold potatoes -- make sure they are in a single layer in the pan. After tossing generously w/olive oil and S & P, roast at 450 for about 35-40 minutes and they get a nice crust on them. Not only do they test better but they are more attractive in the salad.

Easy and very good. I did add an extra clove of garlic to the dressing.

This is really good, I like that it is served at room temperature. I made it as a side for a weeknight dinner, but it would be great to take to a summer picnic and not have to worry about refrigeration or reheating. I tried soaking the red onion, but it was still acidic. I sauted them in olive oil for a few minutes to sweeten them, but kept them crisp. My 4 yr old asked for seconds, can't beat that!

This is really delicious...changed a few things, though. Didn't have olives, or rosemary. I substituted fresh chives for the vinaigrette and added baby green peas (fantastic!). It was truly outstanding. I will definitely add this one to my short list of favorites. (It looks beautiful, too...just be sure not to overcook the green beans.)

This was a nice change to our normal side dishes. I forgot the olives but it still was delicious with pork chops. I will keep this in the rotation.

This was just ok. Didn't really like the rosemary vinaigrette. Soaking the red onion in cold water really does remove the acidity, so I learned something new; glad I tried it :)

I made this recipe last night for dinner guests and it was Wonderful! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I used 1/3 a red onion, as that was all I had, and instead of doing the ice water "bath," poured the vinaigrette over the sliced onion and let sit for a bit, as recommended by another cook. I'm not so sure this step is even necessary, especially if less onion than what is called for in the recipe is used. I will definately be making this recipe again and again, and next time will probably try the full quantity of onion using the ice water bath to see what kind of difference that makes.

Wonderful recipe. Complex and much more elegant than your typical picnic fare. Let the dish sit for a few hours for the flavors to meld. Great with asparagus too--in season of course.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I didn't think the ice water bath mellowed out the onion enough, so I made the vinaigrette and let the onion marinate in there for an hour or two. It slightly pickles the onion, so it stops yelling "raw onion". This is a good make ahead dish, leaving the final combining until about 30-60 minutes before serving. I added some halved grape tomatoes. They looked really pretty and added nice texture and flavor.

I used thyme instead of rosemary and it was excellent. I agree that the water bath makes the onion taste great.

I had very high hopes for this recipe; I brought it for a picnic dinner at the Hollywood Bowl (along with some other Bon Ap. recipes, including White Bean Puree w/ Sun Dried Tomatoes, Fig Tapenade w/ Kalamatas and Classic Date Bars). This was the one recipe with which I was disappointed. It was good, but not great, and I love all of the individual elements and was really anxious to try it. I'll look for something better next time. I was, however, REALLY pleased with the two appetizers and dessert previously mentioned. All worth making again and again!

Our family LOVES this recipe! We are big roasted garlic fans so we like to add thin sliced garlic to the potatoes and let it roast along with them. We also add rosemary chopped to the potatoes before they roast in addition to the rosemary in the dressing.This is such a great way to use the fresh produce available this time of year. We have been making it twice a week with rave reviews each time.

Delicious. I love how preparing the onions this way leaves them raw-tasting and crunchy without the harshness. I used half the oil and it was still excellent. Next time I will add even more rosemary.

Great fresh tasting salad. I used asparagus instead of green beans and it was perfect for a spring cookout. I did decrease the oil by about one-third and it was still great.

Very Good. I added some roasted sweet potato, and used shallots instead of red onion. I didn't blend the vinaigrette and it still turned out nicely.

I've made this salad twice this week. Delish. I love doing the red onions this way. Great technique. I find that there is not enough potatoes in this compared to green beans, so I add a bit more.

I love this recipe! We make it several times each summer and the family can't get enough of it! I always have requests for the recipe. We use double olives (the kids insist on it) and lots of garlic. It's fantastic the next day when the flavors have melded a bit.

Simple but delicious...and, when made with new potatoes and fresh-picked green beans, this recipe became a crowd pleaser!! A visual treat!! Cutting the new potatoes into bite-size pieces, cooking time was reduced accordingly to 20 minutes. We followed the directions of others: doubling the amount of minced fresh garlic (to 2 large cloves), whisking together the ingredients for the Vinaigrette, and assembling the salad in the morning to allow the flavours to meld for our evening potluck. And, be brave!, do use the entire red onion...after soaking in ice water and patting dry, and once tasted, you'll add this 'trick' to your list of cooking techniques!! Yummy!!

This was a great dish, I used nicoise olives, I cut back a bit on the red wine vinegar and added some white balasmic, as I had read in a previous review. The salad tasted very fresh.

Excellent recipe -- must use enough salt and pepper to taste or it could be bland.

This dish is fantastic ! It is eaten almost immediately. For a lower fat version of the recipe, I sprayed the potatoes with olive oil and roasted them for an hour at 400 degrees until crips and golden, occasionally stirring them. It is truly a tasty dish.

I'm not a big fan of raw onion so I used shallots (you also use small pickling onions) and roasted them and the garlic (unpeeled) along with the potatoes. I squeezed the garlic from their jackets into the dressing (which I whizzed in the blender), and used snowpeas (mangetout) instead of green beans, blanched for 1 minute. I made this to accompany pan-fried herby lamb cutlets and it was well received.

The flavors of this salad are wonderful! Roasting the potatoes really makes a difference. I tossed the potatoes with the oil plus salt and freshly ground black pepper before roasting. I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil instead of having it raw. And forget about the blender. Just toss everything together and it's perfect.

I used a 5 lb bag of small-medium red potatoes and fresh green beans for this recipe. Not a big olives fan, so left those out. Instead of raw red onions, I diced and saute'd them briefly in some olive oil and set aside. The brands I used: Bertolli Mild Olive Oil, Carapelli's White Wine Vinegar (instead of red), a big dash of Progresso's Balsamic Vinegar and McCormicks dried Rosemary. Like another reviewer, I let it marinate overnight. The potatoes stayed fresh-looking as was expected, and the flavor was truly delicious, and what a beautiful medley of colors. I'm planning on making this for my next potluck dinner. My husband and I had it this week with the Smoked Sausage Cassoulet - it was a bit of work, but worth it for the beautiful presentation and taste. I'm usually very critical about the way things turned out, but I was very pleased with this particular meal plan.

What is the big deal about this dish? It was OK, I would never serve it to guests. The dressing was mediocre and because of it the entire salad was unimpressive. I followed the directions to the letter. I can see this being fabulous with incredible dressing but it just didn't hit the mark.

When I first got this in the bowl, I thought it was going to be vile, it was quite delicious. I used extra garlic and olives and balsamic vinegar. It tasted 10 times better the next day when all of the flavor settled in. My husband, Mr. Picky eater, even liked it, that says a lot!

Ooooh, yummy! I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red-wine vinegar, both for depth of flavor and a bit of sweetness, and it was wonderful. Like another reviewer, I was surprised that soaking the onions made a difference. All these years, I've been picking them out of salads and leaving them in a dainty heap on my plate, for fear of offensive breath. Maybe this will help - they certainly seemed milder. The brown bits from the roasting pan should be added to the salad - they have lots of flavor. Overall, a terrific salad to accompany grilled meat or chicken, or on its own for lunch.

I have made it twice and it was well received both times. The second time I made it for 23 people - so due to the huge amount we boiled the potatoes instead of roasting them.

I served this at Easter with a ham. The roasted potatoes were the delicious dominant flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, and think that the amount of rosemary was perfect. Soaking the red onion really did make a difference. Glad to have that knowledge.

Perfectly delicious! Wonderful! I didn't have everything on hand, but the substitutions I used were fine: yellow-flesh potatoes, balsamic vinegar, white onion (I didn't bother to soak it). I used only 3/4 tsp of dried rosemary - I was afraid that the rosemary at the amounts given would overpower it. I used 1/2 tsp salt in the dressing....might use an extra clove of garlic in the dressing next time, I should've scraped all the yummy crunchy bits off the bottom of the roasting pan and added them to the dish....
