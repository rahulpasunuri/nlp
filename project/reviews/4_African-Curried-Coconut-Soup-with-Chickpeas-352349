Well, I'm clearly the odd man out here, but I followed the recipe as written and found it insipid. I can see why people double the curry powder. I think it would have benefited from regular (not light) coconut milk, but I won't be making it again to find out.

I made this last spring for a large Easter gathering of family, because my husband's vegan uncle has been joining us recently. It was so wonderful I ended up serving it numerous times for other events. I did make changes, primarily to fit the size of my cooker: a) reduced the vegetarian broth before beginning. b) added more veggies & garlic....sauteed all before adding. c) followed early advice here on only using 1/2 coconut milk. d) used much more curry as recommended but replaced some w/ tumeric because of anti-cancer properties. e). Because I am allergic to legumes, I SPROUT the CHICKPEAS beforehand which seems to make them edible for me! f) saved some of sauteed veggies and put through cuisinart to thicken broth. g) it's true that this makes a great base and is versatile - mushrooms = yes, sushi rice = yes. Thanks to all who came before me :)

Loved this recipe. I used chickpeas I had seasoned and canned for easy hummus along with juice, substituted thinly sliced brussel sprouts for the spinach/kale. Added the juice of a lemon towards last 5 minutes of cooking as substitute for tomatoes. I finally found a way to feed brussel sprouts to my husband!

This soup was delicious! We added some Peri Peri sauce to it and it put it over the top for flavor. Simple soup that I will definitely make again.

The initial recipe seemed a little bland to me. For starters, I cut the coconut milk in half, doubled the curry, doubled the cilantro, added additional chopped tomatoes, a cinnamon stick, about a teaspoon of cumin (next time will add more to taste), and squeezed the juice of a clementine into the soup. I served the rice on the side. This recipe seems to have manny possibilities. Next time, I will use chicken stock and add diced chicken breast.

I enjoyed this recipe as is when I first made it. As some of the other reviewers have said, it is a great base soup. An alternative to the rice that worked great for me is cous cous. I used whole wheat cous cous last night and it really thickened the soup to a beautiful consistency. I also added some steamed carrots and yellow zucchini. Delicious!

Sooo tasty. I would recommend chopping bell pepper & onion quite small and making sure they are definitely soft. I used an African Chermoula curry powder and some chili flakes for extra zing. Removed 2 cups and blended with hand blender, then added back for creamier texture. My guests raved! A definite keeper.

This is so good! I often add mushrooms to it with the peppers. Plus, it's very quick. Also, I usually serve it over rice instead of mixing the rice in because the leftovers seem to stay fresher that way. You can vary the heat level according to your preference.

Tastes like absolutely nothing unless you add about two to three times as much seasoning (curry powder etc) as it calls for. I also added some honey, cinnamon, and juice from a tangerine. It's a good base recipe but experiment with the seasoning because as I said it's so bland otherwise.

This has become my go-to main course recipe whenever I host a big church dinner--it's delicious, beautiful, healthy, appeals to almost all tastes, easy to make, vegetarian/vegan, and filling (though if I don't know that my guests like spicy food, I cut back on the jalapeños). I usually add sautéed mushrooms as another reviewer suggested, but the recipe is wonderful as is. Without fail more than one person asks me for the recipe (and nags me if I forget to send it to them. :)

Soup is outstandingly healthy, warm, comfoting, and pretty darn tasty. Not mind blowing, so only 3 forks. Certainly a crowd pleaser for vegans and veggies.

Very flavorful and easy to add different vegetables if you are trying to clean up your fridge. This is an easy recipe to create because it cooks quickly and can usually made with ingredients I have on hand. I added more beans and a few carrots.

SOOO GOOD! Made it last week for dinner and my husband asked for it again this week! I added yam, broccoli, carrot, and cayenne as it was not quite spicy enough. This time I will be adding chicken for a little variety. I'm sure it's going to be terrific. I've already given this recipe to two coworkers:)

A totally amazing soup. I added a few things to boost the flavor considerably. Not being a vegan, I used real chicken broth. I also added 1 teaspoon turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and a big pinch of ground clove. Gobbled up in no time and 2 of my guests asked for the recipe.

This soup is great and as always I added a few extra spices. Ginger, coriander, and garam masala. I added an extra can of beans (omitted the rice) and blended two cups of the soup with my immersion blender to thicken it. Can't wait to make it again and add yams or shrimp.

A family favourite since we turned vegetarian. All guests like this as well. Excellent as is, and very healthy. Incredibly easy and simple to make. We have this at least once a month. To give it more bulk I will occasionally cook bulgar wheat in vegetable stock to serve at the bottom of the soup.

This soup is FRIGGIN AMAZING! Tried it tonight and the only change I made was 1/2 a chilli instead of a while one, had a nice gentle heat; I felt one whole one may be too hot.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe. We arent vegetarians, but were looking for a healthy and quick dinner option. This definitely fits the bill. It is also seems versatile as it would definitely be good with a meat added in. Im thinking lamb. I did make a few changes based on what I had in the house and seasoning amounts recommended below. 1) Used Madras curry because that is the kind I had and I added twice the recommended amount per other recommendations. It was a good move. 2) Added Cayenne pepper and a tad extra salt/pepper to add a bit more flavor. 3) Twice the rice which made it into more of a stew and was reminiscent of Thai Currry. 4) Added broccoli as I had it in the fridge and it needed to get used. Summation: YUM! :)

I have never made something that was such a hit with my three very different family members. I made this primarily for my vegetarian daughter, who very uncharacteristically had a second helping. My husband, who is not always enthusiastic about vegetarian food, tasted it when I first made it and said he wanted to take it to work for lunch since he liked it so much. (I've had to watch him to make sure he does not eat it all!) Even my picky 11-year-old son ate the first small amount I gave him and asked for more. He also said I should make it on a regular basis. I thought the soup needed a bit more spice, so I doubled the curry powder. (I think tripling could work too, but my family said it was "perfect" the way it was and told me not to change a thing.) It turns out that I underestimated how many tomatoes I would need to yield a cup peeled, seeded and chopped. I needed to supplement with a can of whole tomatoes I found in the pantry. Those tomatoes were redder and more flavorful, and certainly required less work, so I'll not bother with the fresh ones again. This would be a great make-ahead dish to serve a large group.

Great dish! It's super easy (I'm still new in the cooking game, so trust me when I say 'easy') and seems pretty impressive and exotic. Good one to bust out when mom comes to visit! ;) Make sure you get the low sodium vegetable broth. The kind I used was not marked as 'low sodium,' and it made the soup a little too salty for my taste. I threw in some chili powder and lemon juice (to taste) near the end, which kicked it up a bit for me. But I think you could get really creative with this one and suit it to your tastes. I guess the pro's would call this a 'very versatile dish'. lol. I might also try using hot curry powder next time. Even with a little bit of chili powder, it wasn't quite spicy enough for my taste. I'd say I'm about a 7.5 - 8 on the spicy tolerance/enjoyment scale, just to give you perspective :) Definitely trying again. This will make it into the regular rotation for sure!

Delicious soup with a few tweeks. I increased the curry to 2-1/2 teaspoons and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I also pureed it a bit after simmering for 30 minutes. The longer simmering time allowed the flavors to meld together better. I also added a couple of tablespoons of cream at the end of cooking. Very good soup!

Really tasty and easy to make. I cocked it up though because I put the rice in to boil with the soup and even though I tried it, it wasn't properly cooked so when I pulsed it, it was like soups with "bits" but it wasn't bad. I was just expecting a velvety texture as you get with puréed rice, which didn't happen. Taste is excellent though. Like drinking my favourite Thai curry! Which made me wonder, slightly about the "African" origin of this recipe but hey ho! I'll be making it again.

This is hands down the most fantastic soup I have ever made. Only substitution was olive oil for the canola oil. I too decided to puree as my husband doesn't like chunky soups. Added the brown rice before blending and it was rich, creamy and satisfying -especially for a vegan dish. This WILL be made again!!

Rating: 4
Believe the hype. This has to be one of the best soups I've ever eaten, so much so that I've registered just to review it. I prepared it with the following changes: Increased cooking time to about 20 minutes after adding broth and 10 minutes after adding coconut milk. Added Swiss chard stems and leftover cubed zucchini (ca. 1/4) with the chickpeas, broth, etc. and chard leaves with the coconut milk. Omitted rice because of extra vegetables. Substituted two Thai chilis for the jalapeño, added for the last 5 minutes cooking time in a separate pot, as my wife can't handle the heat! :D Added fresh basil with the parsley. I feel like the chard helped bring just a bit of bitterness that helped the soup along. Also, having tried the broth before adding the coconut milk, I was surprised at how good it was even without this addition. If you're thinking about making this but don't like coconut milk, just leave it out. That said, my wife, who doesn't particularly enjoy coconut milk (and can't stand curry!), loved this dish.

As with reviews before me, could be the best soup I've eaten. Extremely simple, fast and few ingredients. I pureed the half the soup prior to simmering. I also simmered 20 minutes vs. 10. Served with couscous.

I also used chicken stock, all I had on hand. Even using just 2/3 of the light coconut milk, it was quite rich. If you want a lighter soup, stick with the suggestions of other reviewers: lighten up on or no rice and less coconut milk. Partially because of the richness I also added a half teaspoon of freshly squeezed lime juice to my serving. I would also (I'm such a sheep, apparently!) puree half of the soup before adding the garbanzo beans. One thing people didn't mention is that ten minutes isn't quite enough for all the flavors to blend. I'd say twenty as a minimum, at a really low simmer. Love, love, love this soup. Quite spicy only because my jalapeno was unusually spicy, I think. Very pretty. I added some big ground chunks of roasted peanuts to my husband's; he likes rich and enjoyed the extra texture.

Made this recipe as shown, but with chicken broth instead of vegetable as it's what I had on-hand, and I used fire-roasted canned tomatoes and opted for fresh parsley. Because the soup was not visually what I hoped it would be (very liquid with large chunks - I wanted a creamier version), I semi-pureed it so it was more of an even consistency. Next time I will do this as well, only I will add garbanzo beans in after the creaming. We loved this soup. It's got a nice amount of heat without the chili seeds and the mixture of flavors is very rich and wonderful. I might cut back on the coconut milk a tiny bit next time, but only because it's not my favorite flavor and it's quite strong in this dish. Thoughts for next time: - add sweet white corn - 2 red peppers - 2 bunches of sauteed kale mixed in Serving tip: 1)The first night I served this with panko-breaded halibut, sauteed garlic kale, and garlic bread. It was delicious. 2)With the leftovers, I made pepperjack grilled cheese sandwiches with the leftover garlic bread and mixed the kale into the soup... it was amazing.

This was outstanding. A perfect cold weather dinner. I did make some alterations. I omitted the rice and added instead one sweet potato. I chopped it and added in at the beginning with the onions and peppers, and it was perfectly cooked by the end. I also used two cans of vegetable broth (14.5 oz each), and double the amount of Madras curry powder. Finally, my supermarket did not have light coconut milk so I used half a can of regular. The first night we had it like that and it was very good, and the next night we added shrimp and fish. I think it was equally good both ways. I will make this again!

I made this for the first time tonight and it was delicious. Due to the resources I had on hand, I subbed 3 peppadews for the jalapeno, and a sweet potato for the rice.

I am absolutely new to this Site, and so haven't even had a opportunity to try even one recipe yet. This one sounds so very delicious, that I read the reviews.

From the reviews, it seems there is little anyone can do to mess this one up. Experimentation is always fun anyway.

Yum! Very good. I did tweak it a bit. Doubled the curry, added a tsp of cumin and more cilantro. The 2 tablespoons of canola oil is too much, in my opinion. I went with chickpeas and jasmine rice and was pleased with the outcome. I couldn't find the low-salt veg broth, so I went with regular and it was just fine. This soup is better after an hour or so when the flavours have married up and the chickpeas have softened. This would be amazing with cashews and shrimp or cashews and chicken. I would also like to try taking it in a different direction with beanut butter.

This was really delicious. I omitted the rice and served it over baked potatoes with some Greek yogurt. Will definitely make this flavorful soup again.

I really enjoyed this. I was nervous that the Jalapeno would make it too spicy, but i followed the recipe and it was delicious. Although i didn't add the rice. Really loved the coconut and cilantro flavor too. Great way to start off a meal! I followed the soup with a Moroccan dish served over couscous.

This is so, so delicious. I chopped up an entire bunch of cilantro, but I really like cilantro. I also added 1/8 tsp of cumin, added some more curry powder (I didn't measure) and some sprinkles of red pepper flakes. Just to spice it up, since a lot of people seemed to think it was a good idea. Totally delish! We are trying to eat less meat, and we think that is a good, hearty substitute.

I was highly skeptical of this recipe but it was great! I didnt have coconut milk so processed coconut and milk into a paste and added it that way. I also ended up using green pepper instead of the red. It turned out great! The coconut substitution worked wonderfully and is much cheaper. I will definitely make again.

Scrumptious soup that I served in small mugs while I finished dinner for my guests. Great on a cold winter night. Will add other veggies like chopped carrots and greens next time.

This is an amazing and quick dinner to have through the winter. My husband and I absolutley loved it. I used medium curry powder because I like a bit a bite and I think I may even add a bit more next time. The corriander addition in the end really helped bring this together. I opted for canned tomatoes to save a bit of time on prep. This is healthy and delish!!

wow. really amazing...perfect size for a dinner for two with ample leftovers for the next day...and it may even be better cold than hot!?

This was delicious! We used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and that worked out fine. We used brown rice, canned tomatoes and cilantro. We will definitely make this again.

Absolutely wonderful! I made this dish for an international feast, hosted by a friend. My husband was concerned about it's lack of meat, but he changed his mind after tasting it. However, I imagine a lighter meat, like fish or chicken, would satisfy carnivores without over powering the soup. I skipped adding the rice to the soup, but many people at the party poured the soup over rice.

This soup is tasty. I've added one large tablespoon of smooth peanut butter, Thai green curry paste and extra hot sauce (Blair original) to enhance the flavor. Be careful not to overheat it once the coconut milk has been added, or it will curdle. A little goat cheese when serving is nice too, but not essential.

A definit keeper! I used quinoa instead of rice, and canned tomatoes. It was a hit with my husband and young boys as well. Very easy and totally yummy!

Absolutely wonderful. Came out very spicy but great. Possibly I used a bigger jalapeno than normal? Also doubled the curry powder and did leave out the cilantro. Filling & tasty.

Not a vegan, wanted some fish in my life so I added fresh Halibut...and also doubled the curry. Flavor city!

Loved this soup. Some have noted that the recipe is not light enough... but remember to use light coconut milk, not full fat. Huge difference. I doubled the curry as many others did and also halved the light coconut milk. Tasted great and very healthy.

Tasted a little bland at first so I added more curry, some cumin, and 2 tbsps of peanut butter and it was perfect.

I loved this recipe. I too cooked the rice separately, in the veggie stock and omitted the stock from the soup. I also doubled the recipe for a crowd and it was a huge hit. More of a stew without the broth, but I prefer serving it that way (fewer dishes!)

This was a great recipe! I made it for a holiday "around the world" potluck, and it was the only dish licked clean! I made some slight changes - I used a serrano pepper instead of a jalapeno (don't like jalapeno flavor very much) and hot madras curry powder to add extra kick. I still took out the seeds and veins, and everyone commented on how it was the perfect amount of spice. I used Osam brand chicken consomme to make my broth, and sauteed small, cubed pieces of chicken in with the onions and peppers. I also added a little bit of garlic powder. I cooked the brown rice separately and just let everyone serve themselves. The rice took longer to cook than this soup!

Four forks since this was extremely easy to make (perfect for a weeknight meal) as well as delicious. I used 1 1/2 jalapenos, vegetable broth, canned tomatoes, 1/2 can of regular coconut milk and no cilantro or parsley (I was rushing). I also opted to serve the soup/stew on top of rice.

A robust, low-fat, healthy veggie entree. More like a stew than a soup. Made it pretty much as instructed, with fresh tomatoes and extra garlic and onion. Used Cilantro. Perfect.

This was very tasty, and a hit with my indian family- though I made it more like a chickpea curry than a soup. I blended a third of it to make it thicker and served it over rice instead of mixing the rice in, and decreased the coconut milk by 1/2 to keep it healthier. Was out of jalapeno, so used crushed red pepper, some chili powder and hot madras curry powder.

Rating: 4
This was a great way to use up rice and pantry items. It definitely tastes more Thai than African, but it was AWESOME!! I eased up on the jalapeno and used a hot curry paste (2 tsp) instead of powder. The whole table had seconds, I can't wait to make this again!

This was delicious. Doubled the curry powder. Wasn't spicy after the chile was seeded, as the membrane had been cut away too, so next time will be sure to leave at least some of it. Lite coconut milk by Thai Kitchen worked great. Taste for salt at end; it needed more. Added chopped cilantro to soup in bowls instead of pot, so that leftover soup would also have fresh cilantro when served.

Absolutely fabulous soup - very unique and interesting. I did omit the rice, since this was a starter for a multi-course dinner. I used half chickpeas and half fava beans, which worked very nicely. And my final tweak was to add a teaspoon of Ethiopian berbere spice to heat this up a little. Oh my, it was so good. I will make this regularly!

Made this as stated with the following exceptions - used Chicken Broth (homemade) instead of vegetable broth - cooked red pepper, onion & garlic, removed from pan then added chicken cut into small cubes (dark or light meat) lightly cooked, then put red pepper/onion mixture back into the pot and followed the recipe as stated. This recipe is a 5*, absolutely delicious! Would definitely make again!

This is delicious. I make it frequently but I add fat free croutons to it. My husband enjoys it also.

Wonderful soup! Enjoyed tremendously by my family. My 5 yr. old said, "Mommy, I don't like this soup. I love it." I forgot to start the rice, so in order to save time I added gnocchi. It was a nice textural contrast to the chickpeas.

This soup is pretty great. For something a little different i made a double batch, added curry paste and cumin to spice it up a little, and substituted 1 can of light coconut milk for regular to make it a little more rich. Then I used a hand blender to puree it, leaving it slightly chunky, like a sauce- added a bunch of steamed veggies like peas, carrots, cauliflower, and sweet potatoes and served over rice. Yum.

YUM! So I have had a can of coconut milk sitting around, not knowing what to do with it (not a big coconut fan so I've been trying to find something where it wasn't a major part) and came across this recipe. I LOVED it! The coconut milk was not strong (actually couldn't really taste it all too much) and I love to add another vegetarian recipe to my list! I added some cumin like someone else had and I think that added another great flavor. The only thing I might change next time is to make a bit more spicy.

This is by far the most delicious soup I have ever made- and super easy. I upped the broth and spice quantities because I wanted a bigger yield, and I also tossed in some cumin and fresh grated ginger. This is going to be a staple in my house!

I was concerned that 1 tsp mild curry powder would be too bland. I increased the jalepeno to 1 1/2 chilis and added 1 tbls of yellow curry paste. The levels of flavor were incredible! Not too hot. All of my taste testers loved it! I omitted the rice choosing to serve the soup/stew over the rice instead. A real keeper.

Wonderful! with a few tweaks. I increased the Jalepeno to 1 1/2. Added 1 Tbls. of yellow curry paste. I think that red curry paste would work, as well. Tossed in a handful of raw dried unswetened coconut and omitted the rice. I think better served over rice. Rave reviews from all taste testers. Into the permanent collection it goes.

This is the BEST vegetarian/vegan soup I have ever made. I used canned, diced tomatoes and I thought it gave the soup more flavor.

This is delicious and easy. My husband and I loved it. We put some slices of grilled chicken in it the next night and it was even better.

Good, but I'll continue to play with it a little as it's still missing a real punch. The first time I made it as written and it was good ... a little bland. Second time, I added a tablespoon of creamy peanut butter and some beansprouts. Just had a bowl topped with some goat cheese and that was REALLY delicious.

How is this healthy? With the coconut milk, this comes out to around 111% of your daily saturated fat per serving....

This soup is spicy (but not too spicy), tasty and nutritious -- we made it exactly as written and loved it! It could be fun to thicken it up with an extra can of chickpeas or another vegetable of your choice.

Delicious and fresh with just the right amount of spice. We used chicken broth, because it was what we had on hand, and it was wonderful. This dish will be on our regular rotation from now on.

Modified a bit, put some greens in (kale/chard), more spice (cumin, a touch of cinnamon). Good flavor, just the right amount of heat. I would make this again.

This is by far the best soup I've ever made. Its so exciting to find such a great recipe that is completely vegan. I was a little scared to try this because of the curry & the jalapeno, I thought it would be way spicy. Its got a little kick, but just enough. I can't say enough good things about this recipe.

I loved this recipe! So nice to eat a creamy soup that is not dairy based. I made it in a double batch so there are leftovers...yes! My husband liked it too but he added lots of extra brown rice. You could serve it over rice too if you like it more mild and/or hearty. Definitely adding this to my recipe collection to make again!

This is a good basic recipe to play with. I doubled or tripled the amount of the spices and added some garam masala. Also used more garlic. I think it needs more veggies; I'm thinking scallions, thinly sliced carrots, water chestnuts and/or baby corn. Possibly pre-cooked potato slices to make it extra creamy. Also frying some curry paste with the onions and the spices gives it a nice kick. I used canned tomatoes but next time I'll definitely follow the chef's advice because the soup needs freshness to it. Also maybe add some grated ginger or a hint of lime. I would suggest making a lot of the soup because the left-overs are even better the next day, and it just keeps getting better!

Wow was this good. I made it with the rice and cilantro. I also used fresh tomatoes and freshly cooked chickpeas. I had to substitute thai chili for jalapeno--but I'm not sure that made a lot of difference. I think using light coconut milk was key. Really outstanding.
