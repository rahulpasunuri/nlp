Man alive, we loved this! I did not have currants on hand so I used dried cranberries instead, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Since we are seriously limiting our intake of pork & red meat, I made it with Italian turkey sausage, made sure to get a good crust in the polenta while frying it, and then plated the sausage/broccoli rabe mixture over the crispy polenta. Now it's 100+ degrees here in the desert, and all I can think about is when I get to make it again.

I prefer polenta to be soft and creamy, rather than sauteed, so I skipped that step and instead beat in a little butter, young goat cheese, and aged parmigiana before topping it with the sausages and broccoli rabe. Additionally, because I'm a vegetarian, I used vegetable broth and Field Roast brand Italian sausages, which are fantastic and deceptively meaty. My BF claimed the only thing that could improve it would be the addition of sliced cherry tomatoes to the broccoli rabe - I agree, so will try that next time. Will certainly make this again, as it made for a delicious "comfort food" meal.

Very nice tasting dish. It has potential to be quite healthy, too. The currants really balance the dish and also add something else - iron, esp. combined with the broccoli rabe. Incidentally, I used rapini - not sure if it's the same thing.

Excellent recipe! Used Baretta quick cooking polenta, substituting chicken broth for the water, and sweet turkey sausage. Key is to throughly brown the polenta until a crispy crust forms. Opted to not add the polenta to the broccoli rabe mixture. Served by plating the polenta, then topping with broccoli rabe, then turkey sausage, and finally a liberal sprinkling of grated parmigiano reggiano cheese. As odd as it seems, do not omit the dried currants as they help to balance the bitterness of the rabe, and saltiness of the sausage. Hearty and fullfilling!

I was skeptical about this recipe: particularly the currants and the preparation of the sauted polenta. But, I followed the recipe and loved the results. The chunks of polenta added to the presentation and the flavor, and the currants were a nice complement to the bitter rabe. The only change I made was to double the garlic.

I used a chicken sausage instead of a traditional sausage, and it turned out very tasty and lower in fat. The recipe would be better with more sausage than is called for. I followed some advice from previous reviews: serve over creamy polenta, blanch the rabe, and omit the chicken broth. These were good suggestions, especially blanching the rabe because it is so bitter. I would definitely make this again.

I love the ingredients in this dish. But frankly I do not care for the published recipe. Usually I make a recipe exactly as printed the 1st time. But these are my changes: I made approximately half the recipe. I have always steamed my sausages in water 1st and then browned them after the water evaporated. I did that here. I also have always par-boiled my broccoli rabe before cooking with it. I did that also and may try it next time without that step. My rabe got a little too soft. I used a 14 oz can of diced tomato. I never saw the need for the chicken broth. The dish was more than liquid enough. Finally I used my own polenta and was not pleased with the way it sauteed - it stuck and crumbled too much. I did it twice, the second time in a non-stick pan. I will return to my usual technique of broiling the polenta. Overall I really enjoyed the dish.

This is a filling and easy dinner. I think I'll add some red pepper flakes and double (or triple) the garlic next time to give the dish a little more edge.

This dish is wonderful! The bitterness of the broccoli rabe balances beautifully with the acidity of the tomatoes and the richness of the sausage. I added more garlic, plus a bit of fennel seed and blanched the broccoli rabe in several quarts of water to reduce the bitterness. Also, I served this over creamy polenta, rather than going to the trouble of solidifying and sauteeing the polenta. This way, you can brown the sausage, then just throw all the other ingredients on top and simmer. This was very easy and had a great flavor payoff!

I really enjoyed the flavor in this dish! We ate this in January when it was cold and windy; it really comforts! As my Italian hubby instructs, I always add sugar to get rid of any "tinny" taste or acid from canned tomatoes. I accidently put too much in and happily discovered that a little good balsamico put it right back into balance. A simple meal to put together, especially if you make the polenta the day before.
