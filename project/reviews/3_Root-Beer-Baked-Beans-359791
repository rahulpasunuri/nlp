After sautéing the bacon, onions, and garlic I tossed everything in a crockpot and cooked it on low for about 24 hours. Everyone at my 4th of July party adored it and the leftovers were just as good if not better.

A lot of people take offense at tinkering with recipes then writing a review. I'm a firm believer in sampling as you go and making changes to suit your personal tastes. This is a great jumping off recipe. Be adventurous! I've learned some great tricks from reviewers who stray from the beaten path. In my opinion, good baked beans have everything but the kitchen sink in them and taste a little different every time, just like chili. Being from St Louis, I used Fitz's root beer, added a splash of regular beer, a shot of bourbon, extra mustard, a few squirts of ketchup. I also took other reviewer's suggestions and used a lower oven and baked them longer.

With a few changes, this recipe is deliciously different and a great alternative to typical beans. I only used 1 large Spanish onion and added a pinch of chipotle pepper flakes and 2 tbsp brown sugar to add a spicy sweet flavor. The artisanal root beer is a must.

Made this recipe to the letter. Used Faygo Root Beer. While I loved the idea of pairing root beer and baked beans, I did not love the result. The root beer added a strange, hard to put your finger on taste. I took it to a party and the other 7 people agreed that it was odd.

I'm a huge fan of baked beans but I really didn't like this recipe. I gave it 2 forks since I took it to a group picnic and others really liked it. I gave away the leftovers. The molasses flavor came through way too strong even though I used only 2 Tbs as opposed to 3. I ended up adding lots of barbeque sauce and ketchup to help disguise the taste.

Great recipe, fairly easy, have made 3x now, mild variations each time. One thing I do, for color and variation in flavor, is use 1/4 red kidney beans. Played with various chili powders. Have used Boylans root beer, very pleased with aromatics and flavor.

Very tasty. Did not have chili powder but used chipotle chile pepper powder and ancho chile pepper powder as a substitutes. Cooked about 45 minutes in the oven. Great with the BBQ tri-tip and caramelized onions (to make broham sandwiches), creamy coleslaw (find both recipes at Epicurious) and BBQ corn on the cob to complete the menu.

This was a very dark flavorful baked bean recipe. The root beer flavor really came though, the beans had a root beer aroma which was nice, and I wasnt expecting this given the relatively small quantity of root beer in the recipe. (I used Boylans). My husband opined that it could have used more bacon. Also, the beans werent entirely tender at the end of 30 mins.

I made this dish for a 20th vegetarian anniversary (minus the bacon obviously). Everyone loved it- gone in seconds. The kind of root beer you use will make the difference.

Easy to do and good to eat, but not great.

we followed the recipe almost to the letter using Real Brew Draft root beer. We put the beans into a slow cooker for a couple of hours. It was delicious!

Apparently foodies from down south are serious about their root beers...I used an organice variety from the supermarket and this recipe still gave my guests the "O" face! I guess Canadians don't need much to put us over the top.

I made half this recipe and used prosciutto instead of bacon (it was all I had). The beans were great. I think you need a really good root beer, and I inadvertently cooked them a bit longer which I think also made them a bit better. The flavor also improved the following day when re-heated. I think bacon would add the smoky flavor that I was looking for. Next time...

This was good, but tasted just a little off. I think the root beer is the culprit, even though I like the idea of using it... I'll try this recipe again without it and see what happens--all of the other ingredients seem like they blend well together. I ended up cooking this on the stove and for longer than called for, but I don't think it affected it much. Overall, good, but a little odd.

I made this recipe faithful to the recipe down to the artisan root beer. What a disappointment! I think the recipe has potential with some changes, but I'm at a loss to know what they might be!

I was curious to try these despite the mixed reviews and thought they were pretty tasty. I used pinto beans instead of white beans and left out the bacon for a vegetarian friend. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I liked them compared to traditional baked beans and would probably make them again (and I'm sure with bacon they would be even better).

I made this tonight for friends. It was the first thing I ever made in my slow cooker. We all thought it was delicious. I will heat it up a bit next time I make it. Everyone agreed the Root Beer was a great taste addition.

Here are the recipes for the baked beans and Lime Chive Butter. I have never cooked baked beans before and if your looking for the canned baked beans taste this is NOT it. However, this recipe has a great flavor and I was told by one family member that this is best baked beans they have tasted. I liked them but I'm not HUGE baked beans fan so my excitement was limited. I added 3 extra tablespoons of molasses.

Rating: 2
The only reason I am giving this two forks rather than one is that I think a much longer and slower cooking time would have been better. The flavors did not mesh well. I agree with a previous review that a bit of tweaking might improve this recipe, but I doubt that I will ever make it again.

I've baked a lot of beans - these are the very best! Wonderful flavor, but spicy, so if you're into canned baked beans this will probably shake you up. I made them for company alongside ribs and they were a huge hit. Easy, fast and wonderful! A definite keeper.

I agree with the other reviewers. These beans were really yucky. Can't quite put my finger on why, but my hunch is that the flavors need a LOT more cooking time to come together. I think that if I put them back in the oven for a few hours over low heat, it might improve, but honestly I was so unimpressed with the initial result that I don't feel like expending the extra effort to salvage them.

You wouldn't guess how I reacted when I saw rootbeer in this recipe. I have always liked rootbeer, ever since I was in high school. For me, rootbeer is the best for pizza. I know most of you might not agree :) Anyways... oh wow! rootbear in this recipe is something that definitely I will already try tomorrow! Amazing! Thank you for coming up with this unique and yummy recipe :)

Surprisingly delicious! Wasn't sure when I saw the unusual ingredients, but it all came together after it cooked for a while. I combined 3 types of beans - black, white & kidney - yum!

I thought there must be a good reason to combine these ingredients -- maybe root beer just goes really well with beans and molasses, etc., but it turns out to be a disgusting combination. I didn't like the flavor at all, and I followed the recipe exactly as written. Sort of embarrassed that I brought it to a picnic. Skip it.

I loved this! It was very easy, and turned out great... if you want a thicker "sauce" just add less liquid and/or cook longer. I used dark molasses, regular smoked bacon and one less can of beans (that's what I had on hand) and it turned out great! Plan to make for 4th of July BBQ tomorrow!!

We loved these beans. I did use BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and I purchased a quality rootbeer (even adding a bit more than indicated); also added a couple of seranos to add a bit of heat. Very delicious! Perhaps it is the quality of the rootbeer that truly makes the difference.

My family really liked these beans, especially the second day. I did adjust the recipe a bit by omitting the chile and adding a teaspoon of liquid smoke. I also cooked them in a casserole dish for nearly 3 hours at 250 degrees next to the pork ribs cooking in our oven. Glad I cooked them for along time because I could tell they were going to need some thickening up. We used an expensive locally made root beer and didn't think the beans were too sweet at all.

I wish I had read earlier reviews as I would give this recipe 0 folks if I could. These beans are horrible though I can't figure out exactly why. I'm going to open a couple of cans of Bush's Baked Beans to save my BBQ.

The worst baked beans I have ever made. Unfortunate for me-it was for company. Not again.

These were the more flavourful baked beans I've beer had! We served them at a bbq and they were a huge hit. The sweetness from the root beer was subtle, the chile gave it a little kick, and they were totally delicious. We will be making these again. Make sure you use decent root beer! (We also left out the bacon and replaced it with a little liquid smoke so that our vegetarian friends could eat it. It was still great, although next time we'll definitely have to try it with the bacon!)

Barely deserving of one fork. Overwhelming taste of sweet root beer and vinegar - a bizarre, awful combination. With so many great baked bean recipes available, don't bother with this one.

Rating: 4
Made these for company along with the Chipotle-Cherry BBQ sauce and baby back ribs and they were a big hit. No one could believe that root beer was the "secret ingredient" I did bake them longer than 30 min. to get the sauce thickened enough, more like an hour, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

I love homemade baked beans but this recipe was a disappointment. The sweetness of the root beer overpowered the other flavors, resulting in a rather bland dish.

Followed recipe to the "T"...even purchased the artisanal root beer. It's really not very good....and I tried everything: -more bacon -more onions -more garlic -more salt ...nothing worked!! :-{

Excellent choice for the summer BBQ! A unique twist with the cannellini beans vs the traditional navy beans/red kidney beans. It will be a welcomed addition to my recipe box.
