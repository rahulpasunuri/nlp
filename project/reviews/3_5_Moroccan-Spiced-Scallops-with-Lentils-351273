Very easy scallops recipe - very flavorful and a nice presentation with the red lentils and the green of the cilantro - it is now on the regular rotation - I did follow the recommendations of my predecessors and added a little minced garlic during the last minute of sauteing the onion, and I used 2 x the amt of spices.

This is a fantastic recipe and really easy to make too. You could easily adjust the ingredients to suit yourself. If you didn't have scallops at hand, I'm sure chicken breast cubed would be great to. Hats off to Bon Appetit Test Kitchen.

This is such an easy and flavourful dish. I recommend rinsing the lentils very thoroughly in order to help them soften up, and sometimes I add more liquid at the end of the 10 minutes because the lentils can dry out. Otherwise, I stick to the recipe and it makes for a really nice and simple dinner.

The fish didn't work for me, but that was because the only fish I could find were wet scallops. They didn't brown so much as steam (yuck). The lentils were a huge disappointment. I used even more spice than called for and they were horribly bland. Never making this again.

Loved this recipe but jazzed it up with extra onion, garlic and spices as per the other reviewers. Also added a generous pinch of Garam Masala and some saffron and white wine to the lentils for some extra kick. Will make this again...and again.

Very easy and quick dinner to make that was really tasty. I made it with a salad and it seemed like a really healthy dinner but one which was filling and satisfying. I used shrimp instead of scallops and it still worked great. I did alter it a bit in that I added lime and some cayenne pepper for a bit of kick. If you use split lentils they cook very quickly. It's only if they are whole that you'll need longer.

You have to use day-boat or dry pack scallops. Whole Foods, Trader Joes, sometimes good sources for these. Canadian scallops are dry pack. Regular American scallops have some disgusting stuff added, and weep and weep and weep.

I made this exactly as it is written for my father and his girlfriend and they could not stop complimenting it! I served it with a pilaf/barley,baby garbanzo mixture I picked up at Trader Joe's, and have to admit myself, it was absolutely delicious! I'm not one to mix sweet and savory, but it works well in this dish. You could lighten the cinammon a bit and still get the flavor, but not have it so intensely. I complimented this dish with mint iced tea and a mango/strawberry fruit salad for dessert.

This was fantastic. The only thing I need to mention is that I have NEVER cooked red lentils in 10 minutes. It takes at least 45 minutes or more and you'll have to add liquid over that time frame as well. Other than that, I'll absolutely make this again. We ate it with the Roasted Garbanzo Beans with Garlic and Swiss Chard recipe. Fabulous!

I'm not giving forks b/c I only made the lentils to accompany the Moroccan Chicken with Olives dish on this site. The lentils were excellent. Followed other reviewers' suggestions about adding garlic and doubling the spice. My husband asked me to make more later this week he loved them so much. A great way to add flavor to a simple summer meal like grilled chicken.

I have made this dish twice now and loved it each time. I added garlic with the onions like other readers. I also added tomato during the last few minutes of cooking. It is truly delicious! Next time I will skip the scallops and add some veggies for a yummy vegetarian meal.

This recipe really does take only 25 minutes! I added a bit of flour to the spice mixture for the scallops and another bit of butter to the olive oil (a trick from Mom - makes perfect scallops every time). The spice mixture could use a bit of cayenne. Also, ensure you don't overcook the lentils if you prefer texture. This met the husband's approval, so it's definitely a keeper for weeknight dinners.

Really great for a simple, quick meal - from things I generally have in the cupboard! Perfect potluck dish too - it makes a lot.

We really enjoyed this dish. From the reviews, I made a few modifications. I doubled the spices and put 3 teaspoons of the spice mixture, used chicken broth vs. vegetable broth and added a bay leaf to the lentils. I seasoned/cooked the scallops as directed. Will make again!

Wonderful, quick and gourmet. Followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Added some tangy cucumber salad that was leftover--a perfect counterpoint to the sophisticated flavors. Yum!

This dish turned out great. I used the red lentils. Like others below, I doubled the amount of spices. I added a small amount of garlic in with the onions. I added a touch of salt to the scallops as suggested, but it was not necessary. (The vegetable broth I used already had sodium)

Although I didn't have all the ingredients for this recipe, I did it anyways using what I had in my pantry. In this case, I used shrimp instead of scallops, and green lentils instead of the red ones. I also added diced tomatoes in the end cause I thought it needed a bit more kick. It turned out to be really good, simple and quick to make... great for a weekday meal. Served it over white rice. Will try again.

This was our first time eating lentils and we loved it! I ate so much my stomach hurts actually. The only thing I changed was switching shrimp for the scallops because I don't care for scallops. Will definitely make again :)

Fabulous dish with the seared scallops, and excellent without. I used flat-leaf parsley instead of the cilantro, since I didn't have cilantro. A quick, easy and flavourful dish.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought the outcome was quite awful. The lentils were fine, but the seasoning on the scallops was very peculiar and, for me and my partner, inedible.

This was delicious. I added a bay leaf to the lentils to give it a fuller flavor. We had just had scallops so I sauteed shrimp with the spices instead and served over the lentils. It was a big hit and we would certainly serve this again.

I will definitely make this dish again. I followed the instructions exactly for the recipe and everything turned out nicely. Next time I think I'll double the lentils and serve this with pita bread. A nice warm healthy dish for a cold night!

This is a fantastic recipe - its easy to make, nutritious, and tastes great. Its even better the next day. The scallops were fine, but I will make the lentils as a side dish for many other meals as well. I also did not have red lentil but the green lentils worked out great. I would certainly not recommend substituting mint for the cilantro as someone else suggested earlier.

I'm at a disadvantage, ingredient- wise, thus one fork short of terrific. Red lentils aren't conveniently found around here, and sea scallops are only available freshly thawed... So, I made the recipe with green lentils; cooked them until the 2.5 cups of veggie broth were absorbed, (about 45 minutes) covered them and set them aside while I worked on the scallops. I had beautiful looking, large sea scallops and was careful (I thought) not to overcrowd the pan, but the scallops never did brown, because of all of the liquid that dissipated from them. I even poured a bunch off. The scallops just added more when I returned them to the cooktop. Next time, I might try a grill (stove top style) so the liquids will run off. But there was so much liquid, I'm not optimistic that will work. I ended up slightly overcooking the scallops, thanks to the steaming process. And I didn't get the extra carmelization flavor that comes from wonderfully browned scallops. The flavors were wonderful, but this recipe works best, I think, if you can get truly fresh scallops.

This recipe was excellent. I did however make some changes that I felt went great with the flavors. I decided to add some finely diced celery to the onions for extra flavor. I also chose to use mint in place of the cilantro. When plating, I first put down some butternut squash soup to pair with the cinnamon. Overall a fantastic dish!
