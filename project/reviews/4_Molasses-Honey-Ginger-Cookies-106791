If you love cloves and molasses, you'll love these! Personally, I like to make them with less of both and more of the honey and cinnamon. Still, the cloves and molasses dominates along with the ginger. The cookies expand a lot so give them lots of room on the cookie sheet. I rolled the dough out to 1/4 inch and the finished product was only about 1/8 of an inch thick. I added a little lemon extract to the frosting...nice. Either dusted with powdered sugar or frosting, they're great!

Great cookie recipe! Had to make a couple of changes to it - used butter instead of shortening and didn't add the ginger (realized I didn't have any half-way through!). I will definitely make them again with ginger. Excellent!

Wonderful ginger bread people. I followed suggestions and switched to butter and they came out great! My only other change was to use lemon juce instead of milk in the frosting. I like the hit of citrus with my sweets.

I only changed a couple of things about this recipe. First, I used one egg instead of the 2 egg yolks. (I'm so lazy!) Second, instead of cutting these into shapes I cooked them as drop cookies after flattening the drops with a spoon. (Yes...lazy.) They taste AWESOME. Really moist and soft cookies. I don't find the spice overwhelming, and I just may have added a touch more spice than called for...I'm not sure because I'm not real precise about measuring spices. (I tend to eyeball it.) I will make these again next Christmas.

I did these cookies exactly like the recipe and, although I had some trouble with the melted molasses which crystallized when mixed with the butter and sugar, so I had to heat on top of a pot of boiling water, everything else was perfect and the result was delicious. I think the problem was the type of molasses I used. I will try with some other type next time. My kids loved them and the amount of spice was also perfect.

meh. They definitely need more spice. The spice kind of hits you at the end, when you're almost done chewing. A good, basic gingerbread cookie. Try the Ginger Spice Cookies recipe here on epicurious...the one with the chopped crystallized ginger in them...THAT recipe is the best.

I doubled the spices as recommended by another reviewer, and used 3/4C of softened butter instead of the shortening. They came out great, and my guests emailed me afterwards to ask for the recipe! I chilled the dough overnight, and found it crumbled too easily when I rolled it out. I let the dough warm up to room temperature, and dipped the cookie cutters in flour before cutting. I had no problems with the cookies sticking or falling apart.

I completely botched this recipe (added melted butter instead of shortening, and forgot the egg yolks!), and still they managed to turn out delicious! Not overly sweet, and very flavorful. I skipped the icing all together, as my family and I felt they were great as is. I am going to try and make them again, per the recipe. I'm sure they will be perfect!

My wife thinks these cookies are too spicy. The kids and I think they're great the way they are. I can't imagine doubling the spices the way some have suggested, but to each their own. Next time I will use half butter and half shortening. I used about 3 1/2 cups flour and that was too much for me, so a little less next time. I did not make the icing, I don't think it needs it. Overall - great cookie, great flavor. A good recipe to keep around for Christmas.

Very easy to make...I used butter instead of shortening and cut back on flour by about 1/4 cup. Instead of rolling out, I rolled into a log, sliced into about 1/2" thick slices, and smashed with the bottom of a glass dusted with sugar. It only took about 8 minutes per batch for mine and they came out nice and chewy, not crisp. I didn't glaze them and they were great on their own.

If a rolled cookie works in Hawaii it's a keeper in my book. I made them a bit thick and think it's the best gingerbread type cookie I've ever had. Rich and spicy.

I doubled the cinnamon and ginger, used 3/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey & baked for 7 minutes. The cookies came out spicy and moist. Yum!!

Spectacular cookies! I tweaked mine to make them healthier with xylitol (instead of sugar), agave (instead of honey) and spelt flower. Got rave reviews from coworkers. I'll make these every Christmas! Yummy!

I wrote the last review and am adding to it. The cookies taste different when made to different thicknesses. More gingerbread-like when thick, more gingersnap-like when thin, so make accordingly. Instead of the icing in the recipe I just dissolved powdered sugar in lemon juice. The lemon flavor went really well with the cookie.

Good, a standard gingerbread cookie. I subsituted half of the shortening with butter. I think the cookie is better without the frosting.. they don't really go together and the frosting overwhelms the taste of the cookie.

Great. And easy. Doubled the spices as another reviewer suggested, and reduced the flour by 1/4 cup to prevent dough from cracking, although I probably did not need to. Rolled beautifully.

Loved this recipe! It's better than chocolate chip cookies! I found the dough a bit hard to roll out though, it kept breaking apart a bit. But great ginger taste!

My son made these for our grandson's kindergarten class to decorate. It was a big hit. They made snowmen, reindeer, Santas, stars, and Christmas trees. They gave us a few. They are simply delicious and much better than buying them already made. We look forward to making them.

YUMMY! Ok, so I did make a few changes...I upped the nutmeg, ginger, and cloves, and I could only stir in 3 1/2 c. of the flour. Since I didn't have the time to chill, roll out and cut out with cutters, I just took the dough unchilled and rolled it into 1-inch balls and flattened with a glass using more of the spiced flour, baking for 5 minutes on dark cookie sheets. The cookies were delicious, and I have over 10 DOZEN of them left after sampling!! A must-keep recipe!!

They were a little spicey for my 4 year old grand daughter but my 25 year old daughter loved them. Easy to make, roll and cut.

Delicious! I chilled it in the freezer for an hour and it worked fine. The frosting was more of a glaze, but tasted good, and you could adjust the ingredients to make it thicker if you wanted to.

Perfect gingerbread cookie! I did make a few changes so don't kill me: used butter instead of shortening (just think butter is superior in cookies!), omitted molasses and used brown sugar instead of white & omitted the butter in the icing. The true testers are my kids, who couldn't get enough of them, even w/o icing! With icing, they are spectacular and perfect for the holidays.
