Will definitely be making this again. At first, I was concerned that it was way too easy to really be *that* good, but I was wrong. This is so fast and easy and incredibly flavorful. We added a splash of fresh lemon juice and used a rosemary flavored olive oil.

Have made this a couple of times now and each time it gets snapped up right away and even people who don't love goat cheese like this. Lovely presentation and so easy to make!

This recipe is FABULOUS! I made it the first time for a wine tasting, and I think it may have upstaged the wine. It is easy and simple, as well as delicious. I have made it several times, and it has consistently been a huge hit with everyone. It is probably best with soft baguettes but also tasty with water crackers. You won't regret making this one!

I LOVE this recipe and it's a huge hit every time I make it. It looks beautiful and is minimal work. I mince the garlic and leave it in the oil. And I make crostini to spread it on. Yum!

I make this with pink peppercorns only. It's fabulous. My book club loved it. My family loved it as an appetizer with cocktails before Christmas dinner.

I have made this recipe NUMEROUS times and it has been a hit every time. I double the seasonings, spread them evenly on a plate and roll the log in it to coat the outside. And I triple the lemon zest, too. Make the oil ahead of time so it has time to sit and envelope the lemoniness. I serve it with Rosemary Triscuits, which is a GREAT pairing with the cheese. YUM!

I've made it 4 times - sometimes substituting basil for thyme. I used garlic oil to make the lemon oil, and it's delicious. Also added a little kosher salt to the pepper mix.

This recipe is not only excellent - but easy too! You can shape the goat chs to fit container or event- Star or Tree for Holidays, 50 or 80 for birthdays, etc.Delish w/viogner & other white wines & red too. I've made it 5+ times since summer! A definite keeper!~: )

I put all the ingredients in a food processor and pulsed for a few minutes. Delicious combination. Served with toast baguette. I recommend making this the day before serving to let the flavours meld together

I substituted rosemary for the thyme, and also added 1/3 lemon-oil mixture for consistency ... this had RAVE reviews from the dinner party!

Like the cook from NC I mixed some of the olive oil, lemon peel and garlic into the cheese. Kept the rest the same. Delicious!

The only thing I'd add to these comments is that you should really use organic lemons if you want ZEST. Or scrub your lemon with hot water and soap, rinse, before zesting!

I've been makiing variations of this recipe for years, and it's always one of the first nibbles to disappear. Try bringing the cheese to room temperature, then blend in about a third of the olive oil/lemon zest mixture. Proceed with the rest of the instructions. This makes the cheese more spreadable. And be sure to use top quality extra virgin olive oil. It makes a huge difference.

I did not have fresh thyme so I used about a tsp of dried and a little less pepper than called for. It was much better second day, would definitely serve it again. The lemon oil & garlic make the dish. Flat wheat crackers (wheatthins) also worked well.
