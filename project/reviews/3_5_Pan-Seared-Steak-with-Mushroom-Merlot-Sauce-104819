This recipe needs a little tinkering, but it is simple and yummy. Definitely rub garlic on the steak before cooking and also add a chopped clove with the shallots. Because some reviewers mentioned a watery sauce, I thickened it with a teaspooon or so with a flour and butter paste. I had about a half cup of homemade broth, so I added that with the wine.

I agree completely with the cook from Charlottesville. This recipe will not be served at my house again. And I did use a mixture of beef broth and merlot as others have suggested.

I actually searched for and chose this recipe to use up some sliced mushrooms I had but, really, this recipe was very unremarkable. While I agree beef broth may have deepened the flavor, I don't think I'll make this again.

I made this tonight, but I followed others' advice and switched the wine out for beef broth. I also forgot to buy thyme, but it was good anyways. I added two cloves of garlic and overall it was delicious. I served it on a bed of asparagus that was baked in olive oil and salt. Me and Mrs. really enjoyed it.

Instead of Merlot I used Cabernet-Sauvignon, cut the shrooms really thick, and added 2 cloves of garlic. Liked it a lot, and so did my husband. Still, I think it was missing a little wow factor, so next time I'll add two more cloves of garlic and some more herbs.

The merlot just doesn't go well with the shrooms. You will get most of the flavor from the steak juices and olive oil that are left over from cooking. Then just add some butter and garlic. If you want more add beef broth, sherry, red wine vinegar are all things I've used for a pan sauce. Basically any basic liquid you deglaze with would be better then this merlot recipe. REMEMBER cooking steak should be kept simple, with simple flavors. Don't try to out cook yourself when using an expensive cut of beef

A very simple, clear, quick and easy introduction to steak and merlot. Thank you!

I love this recipe! It is absolutely delicious. I already had a bottle of cabernet open, so I substituted that for the merlot. I served it next to a simple basil pesto pasta dish, although I like other peoples' suggestions of making a potato side dish. I am definitely going to make this again.

I thought this was delicious and easy (in other words perfect)- I took other suggestions and skipped the Merlot sauce, and I rubbed the steaks with a little garlic before cooking them, but everything else was according the the recipe and it was great!

Very nice. A favorite for a romantic evening dinner. I don't like Merlot so I use whatever red I have around; a nice Cabernet or Zinfandel are good substitutes.

If I made this again, I would have used a better quality wine. I used some awesome wild mushrooms, but I had a fair cabernet sauvigon open and available which I used instead of the recommended merlot. I have to believe that -- at least -- a better quality of wine would have made a difference. As an earlier poster said, this might have been better as just sauted mushrooms and drinking the wine.

I've never been a fan of cooking, though I can follow a recipe just fine. I made this for my boyfriend after he had a particularly rough day, and it was DELICIOUS. In fact, he said it was the BEST meal he'd had in a long time. Very easy and quick to prepare, but do follow the other suggestions on thickening the sauce. Tonight I am preparing it for the second time and can hardly wait!

Saute the mushrooms and shallots--drink the Merlot, don't bother with the recipe. I didn't like this combination of flavors. I also did not like the color, it looked like I was putting pieces of beets on my steak.

So easy and incredibly tasty. Few changes... I scaled it down for one serving but used the same amount of merlot, and then let it reduce longer. I used assorted wild mushrooms. Resulted in delicious and flavorful sauce. I also substituted filet instead of the ribeye.

this was quick and easy and everyone loved it. i also added freshly minced garlic to the recipe the second time. adds a nice flavor. and if you dont like the merlot sauce a good teriyaki jerk sauce is excellent.

The trick to pan seared steak is to preheat a cast iron skillet for 5 minutes...forget the oil, don't need it. Sear steak no more than 2 minutes per side.

I doubled the amount of mushrooms and used crimini instead of shiitake. The fresh thyme was a nice touch. This was easy to make and enjoyable but nothing earth-shattering.

I was terribly disappointed with this recipe. It was quick and easy, but frankly, still not worth the time and effort. The mushrooms were overpowered by the wine and shallots. I definitely wouldn't make this again.

good stuff. not sure, if i did it again, that i would use a merlot...something with a bit more oomph, but all in all, it was quite good. easy and yummy.

Made this over tuna steaks and it was pleasant. I'm sure much better over real steak. Easy to make and gives a nice flavor. Not earth shattering though.

I am not a cook and I made it easily - came out great. As someone suggested I used regular sliced mushrooms, mashd potatoes and tons of shallots and merlot. Lots of reduction made it rich and delicious.

Fabulous! Perfect! Can't wait to make it again!

Easy to make. Sauce not as good (rich) as I thought. Since the receipe did not call for flour to thicken the sauce , it turned out to be a little runny.

My husband made this recipe for a special birthday dinner and it turned out amazingly delicious. The sauce was lovely with a gorgeous burgundy color from the wine. Make this for someone you love, and they will know it!

I made this recipe for a special friend. I was a little worried since only 75% would make it again. I would definitely make it again! I used Mondavi Merlot and substituted regular mushrooms (already sliced), and paired it with mashed potatoes. Definitely a WINNER!

This was absolutely delicious. I made it with 2-8 oz rib eyes with a nice merlot and served it with a grilled red bliss and cauliflower side and a spinach and toasted almond salad. A few notes though: 1. use more merlot (1 cup instead of .75) so you can have a little more reduction. the sauce is really good. 2. as another reviewer mentioned, let the butter really cook in the sauce (like 5 minutes instead of 2). Don't let it burn, but carmelize a bit more with the shallots and mushrooms. 3. use 1.5 - 1.75 tbspns of oil instead of 2. 4. Use plently of salt and pepper on the meat and a bit in the sauce. It is a very savory meal. Served with a crusty bread (for the extra sauce) and the merlot I used for cooking. Kristina ate every morsel and the cat was begging too! The recommended cheese cake dessert (with kiwi) was delish. guest quality meal in 30 minutes...Perfect!

An absolutely surpurb dish which our friends have raved about. I have served this with both garlic mashed and a modified scallopped...both were great accompanyments! The key (I agree) is a truly great Merlot and careful attention to the recipe! Enjoy!!

This dish was ready in less than 30 minutes! I paired it with mashed potatoes and my guests truly loved it!! I admit I was concerned about the Merlot sauce -- but it turned out excellent!

One of the best steaks I've made. I cooked the butter sauce 'til it was nice and brown (not burnt, but certainly most of the wine had evaporated).

This dish is a fantastic, elegant and easy repast. I have made this many times with rave reviews. I prepare this with care to make sure the wine/mushroom mixture is more of a reduction than a "sauce". Served over garlic mashers and roasted asparagus makes an excellent presentation.

The key to this dish is to choose good wine. If the wine is bad, the dish will be as well. If you are not a wine lover, choose something else. Otherwise, this is a great dish that can be made with burgandy, cabernet, pinot noir, merlot, or even port. We like it with the meat marinated in the wine over night & the meat cooked rare. Button mushrooms or morels work in place of shiitake.

This by far produced the most unappealing, tasteless food I have ever made in my life. It was terrible with a capital "T"!!! I would not serve this to anyone (guests???) much less my dog. The dog would be offended. Truly aweful dish!

Rating: 1
I was extremely disappointed with this receipe...I might have just had a glass of merlot rather than waste it on soaking the mushrooms which no longer had any flavour except for the merlot...also 2 tablespoons of oil to cook the steaks made them soggy and greasy. It was okay but definitely would not make it again.

I've made this twice so far. It's very easy and tastes as though the sauce is much more complex than it is. Friends loved it last night. And, we will definitely serve this, again. This is so quick it could be a great dinner when friends drop in unexpectedly- if they ever do these days.

This is a delicious recipe. I made it with Cabernet Savignon and button mushrooms and it was fabulous!

Delicious and incredibly easy! This came together so quickly, if you needed to do a nice dinner in a hurry, here is the answer. I used a bordeaux wine in the sauce and trimmed most of the fat from the steak. It still came out great. Can't wait to make it again!
