Love this!I was running low on curry, so added a lot of tumeric, a tsp of cumin and a touch of Garam Masala. Also didn't have chickpeas but hominy filled in nicely. As a dairy and gluten free person, this hits the spot!

I added a bit more curry powder, some cumin, and eventually (after my first helping) some Sriracha. I also threw in some chopped dried apricots near the end. Stirring in the Sriracha adds a lot of character.

That was bland and boring. I had to add tumeric, cumin, ginger powder and dried black currents to give it some interest.

I have made this more times than I can count. It is a Fall staple at my house. I serve it over brown basmati rice, and it is so warm and hearty that you'd never know it's vegan and gluten free. I can't easily get tomatoes with chiles, so I just use tomatoes and dried chili peppers. Add a little extra salt!

I used what I had in my pantry instead of the canned tomatoes, which was one 28 oz. can tomatoes in puree. I added some medium hot salsa and I added fresh spinach that I had on hand. It was delicious. If you find it too spicy, you may top each serving with sour cream. I'm looking forward to eating leftovers!

Awesome weeknight dinner--fast, hearty and full of flavor and texture. A new winter favorite!

Rating: 3
Easy, fast, inexpensive and healthy. I would definitely make it again. My only modification is that the onions burned on high, so cook them on medium for less than 8 mins. I also added some cumin and coriander for some depth of flavor.

I added roasted eggplant at the end of cooking and loved it. This is a nice recipe either way.

I made a half recipe to use up my leftover 3 cups of cauliflower, knowing we had all the other ingredients. What I didn't know was that we only have 29 oz cans of tomatoes and 19 oz cans of chickpeas... so I used the chickpeas, replaced tomatoes with 1 cup salsa, added some garam masala to 2t curry powder, used 2 shallots (about a cup) instead of onions, and added half a cup of peas in at the end. I poured in more than half of the coconut milk but even with all the changes it still tastes good, if a bit spicy. Ended up with about a litre of it, currently eating some over unfrozen calrose rice :)

This is not outstanding but perfectly fine for a quick dinner that makes lots of leftovers and, except for the cauliflower, uses pantry ingredients (I didn`t use cilantro and didn`t miss it; not my favorite). I hit it up with every additional spice etc mentioned in the reviews and upped the curry. There is no getting around the fact that the two main ingredients are just bland, however. That said, we ate it with mango chutney which really improved it and I will make it again, if not regularly.

This is perfect for when I want to bring lunch to work to heat up on a cold day. It's hearty and flavorful. I used light coconut milk, added more tomatoes and a bit of salt at the end. I also mixed the rice right into the stew because that was easier for dividing it into portions. I did not have cilantro to add but I imagine that would add even more flavor. I also didn't have tomatoes with chilies so I added a half a serrano pepper to the onions (I cut the recipe roughly in half too).

Wow, an easy and delicious one-pot meal. Definitely a make again. Left-overs are even better. Packs well as a gift (w/uncooked rice in baggie) for busy friends.

hearty and filling - but definitely needs more spice. I added salt, cumin, more curry, red pepper flakes, and garlic (with the onions). I also pureed 2 cups of it at the end...a wonderful dinner for a chilly night!

I love this simple and great tasting recipe as does everyone else I have served it to.

Really simple to make and surprisingly good (and reasonably healthy)! I added a little bit of garam masala (maybe 1/8 tsp), but other than that stuck to the recipe. It did take more than 16 minutes for the cauliflower to cook, so I'd cut smaller florets next time.

I added hot curry paste and garam masala. Very nice lunch for 4 days.

A great dish enjoyed by everyone at the table along with grilled tandori chicken and a little mango chutney. The flavors blended together perfectly. This hearty dish could be a meal all by itself and definitely makes it to our "go to" recipes.

This was ok but not something I will be in a hurry to make again. I tried it first as written, then added a bit of garam masala and cumin and salt, then adjusted it a bit more but couldn`t in the end get it to wow anyone in any of its versions. Just FYI, it took more than 16 minutes to cook the cauliflower; this was noted by another reviewer as well.

I found this to be easy to make but in need of salt? If you are wary of the coconut milk, do not be afraid; the flavor is subtle and adds depth. This recipe would do well with other veg additions like peas.

What? Amazing! My honey said "This is your best yet!" Use your judgment and add the things you as cook, know will work. Indian cuisine is quite specific. Off to have a left over bowl as a scrumptious healthy lunch!

Delicious! After cooking one pound of chickpeas, I use most with all of the chickpea liquid to make 'Moroccan Chickpea Soup [Gourmet 11/00], then the remainder of the chickpeas for this recipe. I like cucumber raita with this stew.

So very good - husband says it's in the top five meals I've cooked so it's been saved to my 'go to' recipe file. I used diced tomatoes without chiles & added extra madras curry. The flavors were truly incredible - served it over couscous with golden raisins and fresh chopped parsley. This is one of those that I was surprised to realize later was vegan - very satisfying!

Rating: 3
Based on other reviewers' comments, and knowing that I like more highly seasoned food, I modified the seasoning (4 tsp curry, 2 tsp garam masala, 4 chopped garlic cloves that were cooked with the onions) and also as the dish was cooking, I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar. I didn't have chopped tomatoes with chili, so I used a can of San Marzano tomatoes (which I chopped) and added a couple of small dried chili peppers for a bit of a kick. The end result was delicious... I would say definitely more than 4 servings... and probably better the day after.

Rating: 2
The recipe "as is" is very bland and one dimensional. Definitely add cumin, garam masala, sugar - and salt to taste. Once those flavours brew together, you've got something pretty good - but not amazing. Hearty and healthy - but definitely go with your gut on this one and improvise.

Rating: 3
I was in search of a way to use my coconut milk and cauliflower, so this fit the bill. I cut the tomato quantity in half and used fresh tomatoes and chilis instead. After I cooked, I put the stew in a blender and then added quite a bit of salt, some vegetable broth as well as 3-4 tbs. of fresh squeezed lemon juice.

Rating: 4
this is one of those dishes best served the day after you cook it, to give the flavors a chance to develop - not that it isn't good fresh! If you're a huge fan of indian food, definitely spice it up-but if you are inexperienced or curious, this recipe is a good way to start. I've made this several times - and while I am usually disappointed with the substance of vegetarion food, being a red meat affecionado, this meal is thoroughly satisfying. I can't imagine Indian food without some garlic, so I added a generous amount of minced garlic to the onions just before putting in the spices. I used a combination of maharajah curry powder, hot curry powder, tumeric, cumin, garam masala and a few black cardamom pods. and then more hot curry. Two cans of coconut milk because one seemed quite insufficient, so add more than a combined 5 teaspoons. Definitely add salt to taste, it needs it. My vegetarian & vegan friends adore this, so I've made a huge batch for Christmas, instead of cookies to give. Fabulous.. add some chicken if you miss the meat. Yummmmmmm!

Rating: 4
This was a really easy dish to prepare. I did add an extra can of coconut milk because there was too much cauliflower. It took longer to cook than I thought it would, though that may be because I like cauliflower more on the soft side. I served it over Couscous with Golden Raisins, Pine nuts and Green onions- a recipe that I found on this site- and it was awesome.

Rating: 3
Yummy. I used reg coconut milk since it was in the cupboard. I also threw in some shredded coconut. I thought it could have used something a bit more, perhaps a different type of curry - but delicious and quantity is too big for two adults but perfect for left overs.

I made this with my roommate last night, and it was precisely what we wanted on a rainy, cold fall day. We added a bit of sugar, cumin, and turmeric, like previous reviewers suggested, and also found that it needed quite a bit of salt. But the end result was wonderful. The recipe says it serves four, but I'd say it serves more like 6-8, especially when served with rice. We couldn't find canned tomatoes with chiles, so we just added our own spice to regular diced tomatoes. All in all, a huge success.

Rating: 3
made this for a weeknight dinner - quick and easy. added more garlic and more curry, garam masala. i think i'd use straight up diced tomatoes next time didn't care for the chili's in it. also, cut of some chicken, tossed it in the curry powder and sauteed it - served on top for us meat eaters.

So good! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! A nice vegan stew. I used tomatoes from the local farmers' market. I say you can pretty much make this as-is. You can never go wrong by adding more garlic as some reviewers noted...

I don't want to give it a fork rating because we made so many changes. I love the dish we ended up with though. We used 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cloves of garlic. We added fresh long hot peppers for the chilis and then used a spice mix as follows: 1 tsp cayenne 1 tsp chili powder 1tsp cumin 3 tsp of vindaloo spice mix 1 tsp curry We also added a bag of frozen peas and omitted the cilantro. It was very tasty, very easy and very spicy, just like we like it. Next time my husband wants to add some tomato paste to thicken the sauce a bit. We served it over basmati rice. Oh and definitely makes way more than 4 servings!

Rating: 2
So. As usual, I dutifully read my fellow epicureans reviews. I added loads of garlic, and still it really *was* kinda bland as I was cooking it. I did not have masala seasoning, but added ginger, coriander, cumin. I kept feeling it needed sugar? Honey? I felt making it sweeter might take it to the next level, but I chickened out and just added a ton of cayenne. After it simmered awhile, it came together better. But not awesome. A solid, easy, diet-esque weeknight dinner.

Oh my gosh, this was amazing! I tried a couple of other reviewers' tips and tossed in 3 chopped cloves of garlic and one teaspoon of chicken masala spice. WOW... over basmati rice to boot is heavenly.

This is so easy and delicious, and if you're just cooking for 1 or 2, yields a lot of tasty leftovers. It says 4 servings, but it's more like 6-8. Two things: 1) it takes longer than 35 minutes - that is just a fact. More like 80. 2) I might try this with a little more spice - possibly with actual chilies vs. tomatoes w/chilies 2b) Potatoes added to the mix would also be delicious. Overall though, a big winner and will be made many times to come.

I started this before I realized that I was out of canned tomatoes, so I omitted them and made this into a stewy side. It was DELICIOUS this way. I didn't have cilantro either, still good. My 7-year loved it, I couldn't believe it.

I thought this was bland. Next time, instead of curry power, I plan to use my own mix of garam masala, cumin and turmuric, and I think it will be much better.

Wonderful flavor. It's a keeper. I only used one can of garbanzo beans and one can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I used reduced fat coconut milk and one tablespoon of cilantro pesto as I was out of fresh cilantro. I think I will thicken the sauce slightly with cornstarch the next time I make it. It makes closer to 6 servings. If it seems bland, it may be your curry powder. I only had a general curry powder. A Madras hot curry powder would punch it up.

One more great recipe for day-to-day use! Like all the other reviews, you do need to boost the intensity with ginger, garam masala,(I also added canned peppers(the green hot ones) and some spinach or swiss chard. I don't know what it is but there sure are a lot of fellow Canadian cooks reviewing this recipe! Is it our cold weather?

Rating: 3
I was skeptical as I've spent a lot of time making Indian food only to be disappointed. I followed others advise and added 2 tsp garam masala, 5 cloves garlic, 1 tsp grated ginger,1/2 tsp cumin and coriander and some chicken stock (my coconut milk was very dry) and my husband and I really enjoyed it. Now, if I could find a good recipe for chicken Tiki Masala I'd be set.

With a few tweaks, I think this could go beyond a regular weekday dinner... I added red peppers for color, some lemon juice and ginger as others suggested, but I think it could use something even more. Next time I might also add cardamom.

I think that you need to set your expectations for this recipe, it's a simple recipe that works well for a weeknight. Nothing special. But, you can add whatever veggies you want, which is great. Added some spinach and turnip to beef it up a bit. A pretty good, healthy meal.

great as is. my second time making this I used turnips (had a ton on hand from CSA) in lieu of cauliflower. Also added 1 tsp garam masala, 1/2 t ground ginger and 1 t paprika. and some cooking juice from cooking the garbanzos in house. YUM!!!! Even better.

This stew makes a good easy weeknight meal served over rice. We used regular canned tomatoes (without the chiles) and sauteed two finely chopped jalapeno peppers for a few minutes with the onions. We used a mixture of hot and sweet curry powder. We added spinach at the end. Would probably taste good with a mixture of cauliflower and carrot.

Well, I also thought this dish was a little bland as it was presented. I made several changes that I thought worked well. I sauteed the onions and added the curry while I roasted the cauliflower. I mixed those together and added the tomatoes and coconut milk and some cardamom, cinnamon and coriander. I didn't have any cilantro. I let that simmer for a bit and then blended about half of it. Delicious!

YUM! Made it last night and just heated some up now for dinner. The coconut milk is a little scary looking when you open the can because it's so white and thick (looks like sunscreen) but it disappears right in to the sauce. Yummy and filling.

I've made this dish several times and it only gets better as it sits. Also the ingredients are very flexible as is the case with most stews. I enjoy a dollop of greek yogurt along with the cilantro when serving. Stores well in the freezer.

Having read the reviews, I added a can of jalapeno peppers with the tomatoes. (I only had plain canned tomatoes). Since I used my homemade curry powder, the flavor was strong and nicely hot. I also used the low-fat coconut milk, and I subbed flat parsley for the cilantro. (Can't grow that stuff and it turns slimy in two days when I buy it.) Also, I used white and purple cauliflower. Served over brown rice. I'll make it again.

I couldn't wait to try this, as a HUGE fan of curry/ Indian flavors. I didn't think anyone else in my picky family would actually try it, let alone LIKE it, but my husband is a huge fan! The flavors are great and spicy, a little bland right out of the pan- it definitely needed salt (for us, anyway) --but overall, we love it and it's a keeper at our house. I'll try the lemon juice on tomorrow's leftovers - I can see that giving it a brighter flavor.

I couldn't wait to try this recipe! We have a vegetarian Indian restaurant nearby that I love, and this dish is frequently on the set menu. I didn't have exactly the tomatoes called for and ended up subbing diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro, but the end result was GREAT. Loved it! I think the lime juice in the tomatoes was key. Also used expensive curry powder.

Rating: 2
More like 2.5 forks. It was easy, inexpensive, and relatively healthy. But it just didn't taste all that good, in my opinion. I like other reviewers' suggestions to add lemon juice. In the end, I made a cucumber yogurt to serve over it, and topped it generously with a promiscuous mix of herbs from the garden: cinnamon basil, regular basil, sage, parsley, mint, etc. What can I say? I was desperate to add some flavor! (Incidentally, I liked the mixed-herb taste very much.)

Rating: 2
I am anxious to try this recipe tomorrow, as a previous reviewer said that it tastes better the day after. While it tasted ok, I really feel like it's lacking in flavor and heat. I ended up adding more salt than I would prefer to give it some flavor. I also added some lemon juice, as per another reviewer's suggestion--it really did brighten up the dish and give it a little splash of acid. That said, it's still a good dish and very healthy, so I will no doubt make it again with some modifications.

I made this as described and did not enjoy it one bit. First thing, between the white of the coconut milk, red of the tomatoes, and yellow of the curry powder, it does not look pleasant being mixed together. Second, I found it very one note in taste and texture. This is the first time I've been disappointed by BA/Epicurious.

This is a really tasty weeknight dish. I also like that you get veggie and protein in one dish. I used lite coconut milk to reduce calories and fat. Next time, I will reduce the oil and try to cut the amount of coconut milk by half. It was a little soupy.
