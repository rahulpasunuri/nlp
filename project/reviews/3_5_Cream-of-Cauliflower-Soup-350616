I'm not sure why other reviews say this was "too watery"... It's not super thick, but I think it had a perfect consistency. We had ours with croutons and it added just the right amount of texture. We have the 8.5 cup VitaMix and the entire soup pot *just* fit in and blended really great.

This soup is ok, not wonderful. Too thin for my liking, would 4 cups stock not 6.

Too much liquid in this recipe - if I make again, I will reduce. Liked the flavors!

After reading the reviews I decided to try this soup using roasted cauliflower and garlic as suggested, doubling the garlic. I used 2 teaspoons of fresh grated ginger which added a delightful zing and 2 cups of unsweetened coconut milk plus 1 can of vegetable broth and 1/3 can chicken broth for the liquid which made it just the right thickness for me. I used my immersion blender and added the juice of one lime. It was great, this is definitely going on the weeknight menu!

Fabulous. Intensely flavorful even with old spices and 2% instead of cream. A new favorite.

Yum! Best cauliflower soup yet. I used miso for broth, and it worked, I also left out the cellery and roasted the cauliflower. Last, the head was very small. I used only 5 cups of broth, and 1 leek. Very tasty,

oh and definitely fresh ginger - i didn't have any but i can see where that would add some pizazz too.

i made this soup today after reading reviews. i roasted the cauliflower first and then used lime instead of lemon (that's what i had), doubled the garlic, added some leftover hash browns and it pureed very smoothly. i then tried it with some coconut flakes and that didn't do much and then some parmesan cheese on top. parmesan added a little salt flavor and tasted great. the soup is great without it too. i think coconut milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 might be good as well. maybe will try that next time.

I modified recipe a little, according to previous reviewers' recommendation. I roasted the cauliflower with salt and olive oil at 450F for 30min. I also used freshly grated ginger instead. Overall, I liked the recipe very much, though I also find the soup consistency on the runny side (like other reviewers). For next time, I'll probably add a couple potatoes in there to thicken the soup up a little.

This recipe was a huge disappointment. I was expecting it to be very flavorful, but it was so very BLAND! I think the recipe calls for way too much broth, and it really diluted the flavors. I kept adding salt and pepper at the end, but even after a large amount, it was only slightly improved. There is just no depth of flavor in this recipe at all. I was tempted to use less broth in the first place, but decided to follow the recipe exactly. I'm disappointed that it made such a large volume too, because I think I'll be throwing away the remainder.

Very good and simple recipe. I roasted the cauliflower and went with a vegie stock. Watch the amount of lemon you use, a little gives it a nice pick me up but a little to much will ruin the flavor. 1/2 a juicy lemon is too much.

This was extraordinary! It was a breeze to prepare and the ginger and curry as well as the lemon really came out shining in this recipe. I am not the biggest fan of cauliflower but this is the best soup I have ever made...and I make a lot of soups!!

do NOT use the half and half. NOT needed. Only had 5 cups of broth. used whole lemon and instead of throwing out parsnips, i through them into the pot with cauliflower. this soup was/is awesome.

This is a delicious soup & easy to make. I added freshly grated ginger to add a little pop & enhance the the curry base.

Adapted this recipe for my Thermomix (aka Bimby) so only made half and then regretted it - yummy! The curry and ginger flavors give it some pizzaz but are subtle enough not to overpower. Definitely one to make again and again.

Made as directed. The soup really lacks depth in my opinion. We ended up adding extra homemade curry spice and it improved the soup but still not enough to make again.

Made this recipe as is, except that I replaced the lemon with lime, and I didn't add any cream (it tasted delicious without it). Yummy soup! I thought the spices might be overwhelming, but the end result was quite mild. If you like this soup, try this other recipe from epicurious.com: "Cauliflower Soup with Toasted Cumin and Lime".

Very tasty, except the curry was more overpowering than the recipe stated. Still, very enjoyable and made great leftovers

This soup was a big hit with everyone. It was actually easier than I thought. It made a ton. I think a little white pepper would be nice next time.

Substituted 4 shallots for leeks, omitted the celery (didn't have any), and used half a cup of heavy cream instead of the half-and-half, though excellent pureed without dairy. Delicious and very easy. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

the soft buttery taste was lovely. i didn't have the ginger so skipped it, and had to use lemon juice from the store bought plastic lemon, and only had a mild curry powder on hand. wasn't willing to take on the fat and calories of half and half so tried some milk in just the first bowl but didn't feel it added much so skipped it all together. may use half the olive oil next time to make even skinnier.....

I omitted leaks and used lime instead of lemon as I didn't have either ingredient on hand. I omitted the cream because it tasted so good without it! I'm going to try to make it again with broccoli.

Who would have thought that cauliflower could have such a delicate taste. I have made this on more than one occasion. Forgot to put in the half and half once and it was still delicious. The curry powder really gives it an excellent taste. I usually miss out the ground ginger.

This is very good. Be careful how much you put into the food processor at one time; do batches.

I make this at least once a week now, I am addicted to it. I also use what ever type of onions i have in the house and fresh ginger. I omit the cream just to be "skinnier". I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soup.

I thought this was really tasty. I substituted onion for leeks and fresh ginger for the powdered ginger and the end result was delicious--light and fresh, yet creamy and satisfying. My 21 month old daughter devoured 5 small bowls full!

DELICIOUS! The lemon and ginger gave it a very fresh flavor, while the scallions and curry made it nice and savory. My husband and I really enjoyed this one. I served it with garlic bread and salad and it was an easy and delicious meal.

This had way too much ginger. I would omit it from the recipe entirely next time. Doctored the finished soup with onion powder and lemon juice to give it a little more flavor. It was okay once garnished with sliced scallions, but I wouldn't make it again.
