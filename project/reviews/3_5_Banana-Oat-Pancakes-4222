Made these with King Arthur cake flour and 2 tsp baking soda. Omitted the wheat germ, too. They were so delicious!! This will be a staple for us.

Our favorite pancakes! The texture is so good- just the right amount of oats to give it a hearty feel, and they aren't too sweet. They also reheat well, so we make a big batch and freeze the extra.

loved these, esp dusted with confectioner's sugar:)

I've been making this recipe for I think about 5 or more years. I usually go for recipes that are all from scratch, but using mix here makes it easy to feed a hungry preschooler in no time. They are thick so if you are more fond of thinner pancakes add 1/4 cup or so more of milk. I'm thinking about adding syrup or honey to the batter they can be portable without the mess. I also never add the wheat germ, because it's something I don't have on hand.

Delicious pancakes. My husband usually hates pancakes and he ate 6! Nice texture, subtle banana flavour & filling without being heavy. I didn't use the butter, just wiped the pans with canola oil and ate them with strawberries & cream. Heavenly!

These were delicious and a great way to use ripe bananas. Didn't have pancake mix so used 1 1/4 c. flour, 4 t baking powder and 1/2 t salt. But definitely going to look for the Krusteaz oat bran mix.

Very heavy with a light banana taste. They are very filling but sort of bland. Okay recipe, but MUCH prefer the Banana Pecan Cornmeal Pancakes on this site.

All I did was void the wheat germ, and use 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk. There was a little bit of fat in this one...but it's worth it! Topped it with homemade peach preserves. Delicious!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight. We loved it! 3 out of 4 picky eaters (aka my children) gave it a thumbs up. The one who didn't doesn't like anything anyway so she doesn't count! I loved how substantial and filling they were and packed with "healthy stuff" and less fat than ordinary "white bread" pancakes. Yummy!

Very good! I didn't have oats, so left them out and didn't make any substitutions. Made for a delicate, slightly sweet, and hearty breakfast. Even my husband, who normally doesn't like pancakes because of dry texture, enjoyed these. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Too heavy; it didn't really taste like pancakes at all. Also, there was hardly any banana flavor; banana bread or muffins is a better way to use up those old bananas.

A great dish, especially if you have old bananas lying around that you don't know what to do with. (And if you don't like half-blackened bananas, you're probably in the majority.) Very filling and nourishing, good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, easy to make. Also tastes very good if you add raisins or shredded coconut.

Wonderful! I recommend NOT using the butter--use nonfat cooking spray instead and avoid the unnecessary fat and calories. I served them with fresh blueberries and raspberries. Everyone loved them!

What I particularly liked about these pancakes is that it took only 2 of them - sized as indicated and made with less butter than called for - to completely fill me up for breakfast. That was a pleasant surprise! Very hearty, and although it would up the saturated fat content, another cook's addition of coconut sounds fantastic.

The batter was so heavy, it reminded me of fritters! I loved that there was no oil in the batter so I cooked them with spray and no butter. Also did not have pancake mix so added 1 1/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour, 2 tsp. baking powder and 1/4tsp. salt. Without the butter, they definitely needed maple syrup, but my picky one year old loved them and they sure are hearty!

I almost passed this recipe by because pancake mix is just not something I keep in the house. I really did want something different (not that I don't still like banana bread or muffins but...) to do with overripe bananas so I decided to take a stab at it with the dry ingredients from my usual pancake recipe. Try this: 1 cup flour, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup oat bran. Whisk that together and use it for the pancake mix. It's not quite the 1 1/2 cups called for but it worked out great and makes this recipe a keeper. I'm not much of a nut fan but this recipe would take to nuts nicely...I think I'll try blueberries next time, or maybe chocolate chips...

oops that was me who put 1 fork when it probably deserves 4 as everyone else said... i hope that doesn't lead anyone to beleive they're less than perfect!

I had a similar pancake served to me in Hawaii when I was a wee tot and was entralled with the banana melded into the batter. This recipe was incredibly easy to make and made me feel good about it's nutritional properties. I experimented with fresh blueberries, added additional nutmeg & cinnamon. Although I am usually a sauce monger, these pancakes required not a drop of maple syrup.

I started making a version of this that I created myself even prior to seeing it on the site and, like the one other person mentioned, I hardly ever make regular buttermilk pancakes anymore. I created it when I started buying Krusteaz low fat oat bran pancake mix which works great. No eggs or milk are necessary with this mix, just add water, I use half water half oj which is a great compliment to the bananas. Quick oats can be used in place of regular, both work well. I also add nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. Adding pecans or walnuts and/or dried cranberries is also nice. The number 1 thing I would like to stress here is, 6 tablespoons of butter is a great way to defeat the purpose of this healthful and truly delicious creation. I use almost none with just pure high premium maple syrup and they are to die for!

I had some bananas that were overripe, so I used them for this recipe. I didn't have wheatgerm and I used regular buttermilk pancake mix, and the pancakes still turned out very well. The batter was a little more watery and I had to gently nudge in the edges as they were cooking, but the final product was definitely hearty! This is a great weekend breakfast item.

What a nice change from regular pancakes! My kids at first turned up their noses but after eating 1 pancake they were quickly asking for more and saying "yummy"! Pretty healthy also - this will be included in my weekend menu for sure!

This is a great weekend breakfast! I have a picky 2 year old so it is a nice way to sneak some fruit into his breakfast.

A Sunday morning ritual. We don't even make regular buttermilk pancakes anymore. Great when camping. We premix dry ingredients in a plastic bag and add eggs and milk at the campsite when we want a hearty breakfast.
