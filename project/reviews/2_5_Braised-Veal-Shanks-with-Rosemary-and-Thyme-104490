I made this for a dinner party. It is good for an everyday meal, but is not guest-worthy. The sauce (composed mostly of diced tomotoes and chicken broth) was too thin and acted more as a giant marinade.

I've made this dish several times and it always comes out beautiful. Great Sunday evening dinner served over goat cheese mashed potatoes.
