This is the best egg roll recipe I've ever used! Delicious. The perfect blend of flavors. I left out mushrooms and pork because I can't eat them. I still used only 1/2 lb of chicken (diced leg meat instead of ground). Wonderful flavor. Would be delicious as vegetarian rolls too. The recipe could do with more detail in rolling the egg rolls because it can be tricky. Just make sure you roll them as tightly as possible and there are no gaps or cracks where oil can seep in. The Vietnamese dipping sauce is Perfect. Makes me want to buy the book!

Excellent recipe. I modified it by cooking the ingredients since I was going to make the rolls a bit larger.

I think this recipe is pretty authentic. The person who rated this recipe with 1 fork is crazy. Doesn't she know that to cook Asian food require a lot of time. And the ingredients are easy to find anywhere. Where does she live anyway? In Timbuktu America? She must not know how to cook.

Delicious! They are a bit time consuming as the other reviewers noted, but they make a ton of spring rolls. Which leads me to my question - does anyone have any tips for storing them so they don't become soft and mushy? I tried wrapping them in paper towels last night, but that doesn't seem to have worked. We tried both frying them in a pan and in a deep fat fryer; the pan worked a lot better than the fryer, in which they never really got brown.

Where can I get authentic spring roll wrappers? The ones I bought won't brown, they just get hard as a rock!!!I would make them again, IF I can find the right wrappers. O.K.?

This is one of the worst recipes I have ever made. I wouldn't be as frustrated if I only sunk half an hour into making the spring rolls, but searching for ingredients, preparing the filling, and wrapping and frying each spring roll was a five hour task. Not to mention how tedious it was to stand in the heat of the oil for an hour, trying in vain to get the spring rolls to cook evenly. You see, because there are several layers of wrapper on one side of each roll due to folding, and only one layer on the other, the rolls are off balance and flip so that the heavier side faces downwards no matter what you do. This results in one side that is burned and another that is hardly cooked. On top of all this, the ingredients are expensive and hard to find. But you don't taste a single one: all there is is the overpowering flavor of frying oil. In summary, the spring rolls are expensive, time consuming, and just plain awful. Avoid this recipe at all costs if you wish to save fifty bucks and an entire afternoon of your life.

Tasty, but save for when you have tons of spare time.

These are so good! I have made the Filipino lumpias, but this is by far the best recipe for spring rolls.

Great spring rolls!! I made this for a party and they were gone in minutes. I used dried shitake mushrooms and spring roll wrappers. I served with a Asian Chicken Marinade. I will make this again!

This a fantastic recipe, I've used it for years. Don't get discouraged if you can't find the wrappers she mentions, ask your local asian grocer for a recommndation. And, buy her book, it has many great recipes.

I thought these were very, very good and really quite easy to make. I did not find the Menlo brand wrappers, but another wheat wrapper that worked perfectly. I followed the recipe to the tee, even measuring everything - something that I usually just eyeball. The only thing that I did not use was 3 chilis (used 1 only) for the dipping sauce as my DH doesn't care for the heat. In fact, when he tasted it without the rolls, he was a little skeptical, but soon realized that the rolls would offset the heat in the dipping sauce. He ate about 12 rolls with sauce. I guess he liked them, too!

These were fantastic! The dipping sauce is a must. And the mint, lettuce, and cucumber wrapper was a great addition. One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants (which has long since closed) used to serve these spring rolls sliced into 3 or 4 pieces each over a salad of thin noodles, cucumbers, cilantro, marinated carrots, bean sprouts, and lettuce. This allowed for just pouring the dipping sauce over the entire dish. I will definitely try them this way next time!

Incredibly good. Got all the stuff at a Safeway and put it together in around an hour. Did the dipping sauce too. Fairly labor intensive but worth it.

I have made these from Ms. Pham's cookbook many times. There is also a version using mashed tofu instead of ground chicken/pork. With the vegetarian version you must squeeze the filling with cheesecloth to get rid of any extra moisture. My 4th grade son took these to school in his lunch and was selling them for a dollar each!

Finding the wrappers which she speaks of is TOUGH. I went to multiple stores and never found them. But you can make your own with flour and water - just be prepared to do some work as a result.

Vietnamese spring rolls are by far the best version of the dish in all of Asia. The layering of flavors, textures and temperatures in this simple fare make it not only exotic, but exquisite. A must with the lettuce wrap with mint and cilantro as well as the nuoc mam. I have been eating these since college and this recipe is excellent with good tips for making a tricky dish.
