I use another Muhammara recipe on epicurious when I make this, but it is a phenomenal recipe. One of my favorites!

Excellent. Made the muhummara from the other recipe on the site--the walnuts were a great addition. Also just used standard pita and simply heated them in foil in the oven. Served with a bowl of olives and feta. Definitely making again.

We made this recipe for our Gourmet Group and it were great. We also made our own flat bread which really added to the entire dish. Next time I would make much more Muhammara sauce, as that was exception. We did add a small amount of ground pork to the ground lamb and I thought that also added to the overall excellent taste. I will make these again. I think that these can be made in advance and reheated the next day.

I stored all of the leftovers (onions, meatballs and muhammara) in one container. Reheated and stirred together the next day and it was even better than the first day. I agree the yogurt sauce could use some garlic and/or lemon zest. Worth ordering pomegranate molasses, if you can't buy it locally

I was completely unprepared for how amazing this was. It is certainly one of the best things I've made on this site. I used basil instead of mint (can't stand the stuff!), and used the other Muhammara recipe on this site. I accidentally used Spanish paprika--way too spicy, but still delicious. Everything worked well together, the yogurt sauce was delicious, and the Muhammara balanced everything nicely. I can't wait to make this again.

I wanted to comment just on the Muhammara. Traditionally, it's made without water and has olive oil, chopped walnuts, raw minced garlic, pomegranate molasses, and sumac spice. Just combine the roasted red peppers, a good dash of olive oil, and the remaining ingredients in a food processor and pulse a couple times. It's much tastier than the recipe here. Good luck!!

Wow, this was nice. I couldn't find fresh mint so I substituted fresh basil from my garden - turned out great. I also used ground beef instead of lamb, just because my husband and I aren't huge fans of lamb. I used lowfat Greek yogurt for the sauce and it was thick but really delicious. I disagree with other reviewers that the yogurt sauce is bland. I thought it complemented the strong flavors of the spicy meatballs and the sweet/sour muhammara quite nicely. The onions were so delicious. What a great meal! Will definitely add this one to my repertoire!

I only made the meatballs and they were superb. Made muhammara sauce from a different recipe from this site as recommended by others. Used half lamb, half beef and they came out fantastic.

Wow - this exceeded expectations. Flavors mixed very well. Made extra yogurt sauce and used it for dip the next day.

We loved the meatballs. Very flavorful and juicy. However, I would have to agree with other reviewers that the yogurt sauce could have used a little more zing. Next time, I will add garlic, or maybe a little lemon zest to pull out the flavor.

My husband made this over the weekend. Very delicious. I found a recipe for Pomegranate Syrup/Molasses from Alton Brown on foodnetwork.com. I love lamb but my husband doesn't so he used half lamb, half lean beef.

Incredible! I grilled this, forming the finger-shaped meatballs around flat skewers, and that worked out great. I used sweet Pimenton de la Vera paprika, and found that to my taste it was right on the edge of being too much paprika - the paprika was a little dominant. Suggest backing off ever so slightly on the paprika, and be aware that this is a spicy recipe, so you'd need to modify significantly to serve to young children or others who don't tolerate spice. Lovely, lovely recipe, will absolutely make this again. Served with the Lemon Herb Tabbouleh recipe from this site.

Absolutelly delicious Turkish cusine recipe!!Pomegranate syrup works geat for it!

Rating: 4
Easy to make. Substituted beef for lamb and it was delicious. Be careful not to over-cook the meat; it's better with more juices. I used Pomegranate syrup instead of molasses and the results were a bit runny, but I don't know whether it was supposed to thicken or not. Meal was good with or without the Muhammara.

Agree with good but not fantastic! If making again I would add some garlic to the yogurt sauce, use 1/2 lamb and 1/2 lean grd. beef. I like lamb, but in moderation! The amount of paprika was fine for us- used 1 of Sweet,1 of Smoked Spanish(my current favorite spice)and 1 of Hot Hungarian. My firs Muhammara, so nothing to compare to. I thought the flavors were good. Onions were one of the highlights of the dish. Agree with the comments that heating the flatbread for 2 min a side was too much, they just need to get a little warm and toasty. One more meatball from Jean to try!

This might very well be the best recipe I have ever used off this site. Truly delicious-- easy enough for a weeknight, but would also be a great party dish. I made it just according to the recipe and might tweak it a little next time, but it's fantastic as is. I don't know if I used particularly fatty lamb, but I had a lot of grease in the pan after cooking the meatballs. I dumped it out before making the Muhamarra Sauce in it.

Oops! I meant will try garlic in the yogurt sauce next time!

Loved it! Made my own pomegranate molasses by cooking down 1 quart pomegranate juice, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice until it was thickening up and reduced to about 1 1/4 cups (took about an hour on low). Will try garlic in the muhammara sauce next time. As to the flatbread, we used pita breads and were perfectly happy with them.

Delicious. Nothing more to say.

I used 1 1/2 tbsp of paprika. and it was just perfect. And made the meat balls with lean beef with great results. You can also have this dish "falafel style": in a pocket pita bread with diced cucumbers, tomatoes and the sauteed onions, with the yogurt sauce.

Absolutely delicious!!

I agree this was wonderful. I made the meatbalss exactly as shown and they were great. The only modification I made (after tasting) was to add garlic to the yougurt sauce. I also did not use this Muhammara recipe, I used another one from Bon Apetit on this site. Excellent!

This was wonderful and easier to make than expected. I used lean ground beef because it's difficult to get ahold of ground lamb around here. Skipped the muhamarra because we can't find the proper ingredients and used a hummus recipe from this site instead. Only other substitution was a little minced garlic in the yogurt sauce (which was a revelation, sooo good). Big time BF pleaser,and not too fatty if you strain the meatballs. Next time will add tomatoes, cabbage, and red bellpepper to up the veg intake.

I tried it with lamb tenderloin (minced). Excellent with the muhammara as a side

I'm rating this 4 forks with the reviewer recommended modifications of using the other Muhammara recipe & adding garlic to the yogurt sauce. Those are both so good that I've made them 3 times for other recipes. I had a little Muhammara left and some grilled eggplant and pureed those together & it was delicious as a dip or spread on flatbread. I think there is a typo in this recipe. 3 Tbsp of paprika turned these into Hungarian meatballs. Chicken Paprikash doesn't even have that much!! No one mentions this so maybe it was just that my paprika was new but I would say 2 teaspoons or 1 Tbsp would be more like it, most Kofte recipes don't have any. So basically I love this recipe because thanks to reviewers who changed everything about it & using less paprika turns the whole thing into a new recipe that's GREAT!!

This was really good. I would use nan rather than flatbreads next time and not cook them as long as 2 minutes on a side. The flatbreads got tough after that long. I also might try some pepper flakes or a hot pepper in the muhammara to give it some heat with the sweet. Pretty easy to make too.

Fabulous Kofte! Even though the muhammara & yogurt sauce weren't stand-outs on their own, the whole dish was AMAZING when put together. Next time I'll try Merion's suggestion & add garlic to the sauce.

I haven't eaten this yet. Waiting for hubby to come home. I made each part (using the muhammara recipe suggested by a reviewer) and my house smells like I've never smelled it before. It smells SOOOOO good! You might want to make this for company because it just smells so good!

Terrific! And so easy. I am all for adding more of the spices to the lamb, and some garlic to the yogurt sauce (loved the yogurt/ tahini combo.)

This was very good, and very easy. I substituted ground turkey for the lamb and formed it into patties and grilled them instead of pan frying

This recipe was seriously awesome! It was easy to prepare, too. My almost-10-month-old son was supposed to be eating something else but when he saw the platter come to the table, he had a fit we were eating something other than what he had. We gave it to him and even he loved it. I will make this again and again!

The meatballs get 4 forks, the other items I wasn't quite as excited about, but they were still good. I felt like the yogurt sauce was lacking something but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it needed. The muhammara wasn't like other muhammara that I've made in the past, but it wasn't bad - just different. Next time I'll double that part of the recipe because you don't end up with much.

Oh holy Kofte this dish was INCREDIBLE. I made it tonight (on a weeknight after work) and found it to be very easy and fairly quick. The meatballs were incredible and I wouldn't change a thing. On the Muhammara, based on the previous reviewer, I did a combined recipe of the puree of muhammara from Bon Appétit November 2008 and chopped roasted red peppers sauteed in the pan after the meatballs. It was great. Will definitely make again!

This was delicious and a nice change from turkey leftovers. The lamb meatballs were really tasty - don't doubt the amount of paprika as it really works! The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks was the muhammara sauce. It was good but not outstanding. Next time I might try one of the authentic recipes (including walnuts) that I had searched out. I did roast my own pepper for this sauce, but otherwise made all as written.
