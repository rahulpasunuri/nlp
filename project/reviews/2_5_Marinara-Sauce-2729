Way too much onion and not nearly enough tomatoes!!

How can I give this recipe Zero Forks? This recipe is an abomination. It can only be described as a marinara sauce recipe for people who hate the taste of tomatoes, but love the taste of onion. I heartily recommend starting with another recipe, and giving this one a pass. By the time I finished doctoring this one, I was wondering why I didn't just open a jar of Ragu, and I hate Ragu.

I agree with a lot of the sentiment here. This is not a good recipe. Marinara is NOT heavy on onion and the editors should know better. Give this a try ... Saute a bit of onion (2 or 3 slices, chopped fine) in olive oil. Add 2 or 3 chopped cloves of garlic, saute until aromatic. Add a couple cups of crushed tomatoes, more if you wish. Bring to a good simmer for 5 minutes or so to get a good cook going on the tomaotes. Add 1/2 cup good red wine. Add 1/2 cup broth. Simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Add 1/2 tsp each of oregano and basil (more fresh if desired). salt and pepper to taste. Add a bit of crushed red pepper if you like the bite. Simmer on medium low for about 45 minutes, adding more broth if necessary. easy to make, keeps for a while in the fridge and can be used for just about anything calling for a red sauce (although I think stubby pastas deserve a long slow cook sauce) bon appetit

I agree with the other reviews in that the onion to tomato ratio is off for this recipe. I added the following ingredients to my marinara: carrots, zucchini, rosemary, 1 small can tomato paste, and additional sugar. Enjoy!

Blah sauce on its own. I cut the onions by half increased the garlic and pureed a serrano chile with alittle bit of the tomatoes to create a spicy sauce that goes gtreat with any pasta or store bought ravioli. Its a great meal to make on a night where you want to just make the sauce and have a glass of wine with your husband while it simmers.

This is a good recipe to start from for a marinara sauce from fresh tomatoes. I agree with other reviewers that the ratio of tomatoes to onions is way off. I've made two batches of this so far with this summer's tomato crop. The first one I made pretty plain, just increasing the herbs and substituting brown sugar. The second batch I also increased the garlic, cooked the onions until they were a little carmelized before adding the tomatoes (~15 minutes), splashed in some red wine, and added crushed red pepper with the herbs. I am happy with both batches.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. It's not really marinara sauce but more of a tomato and onion mash.

Once I completely reworked the sauce it was OK. If I make this again it won't be the recipe as printed. I'd use half an onion, finely chopped, 2 garlic cloves, and fresh herbs. There was way too much onion, which masked the flavor of the ravioli I used it on and also dominated the texture.

I'm not a big "red sauce" fan-It's always too thick and acidic. This recipe was fabulous over spinach ravioli. My husband loved it and he didn't add any salt and pepper-the recipe called for just the right amount for flavor. I did change a few things. I added one onion instead of two, about 3 cups tomaoes and instead of dried basil, about twenty fresh basil leaves from my garden-so good!

I got a recipe from Jeff Smith (Frugal Gourmet) for Sicilian Marinara. and it's the best. L-O-N-G simmering with FRESH ingreients is the key. Don't bother seeding the tomatoes...i's not worth the trouble, and they add to the sauce.

this sauce has excellent taste and texture

I agree. Less onion (or more tomato), more garlic, red pepper flakes and a bit more basil. This was a good jumping off point for someone who had nevre made marinara from scratch before. I also think it could use 2 1/2 teaspoons dried basil instead of just a pinch, 1 teaspoon dried oreganno instead of just 1/4 of a teaspoon, and some shallots.

This is the worst sauce ever! Too much onion and no flavor! Any poor-quality store-bought sauce is better!

Not worth the effort...instead - search for a real marinara.... An onion-less recipe that calls for more than a "pinch" of basil.

VERY EASY. USED FRESH BASIL AND OREGANO MORE GARLIC AND LESS ONION. ALSO ADDED SOME CRUSHED ITALIAN RED PEPPER TO GIVE A LITTLE BODY.

Excellent and simple. I used home grown tomatoes for a great result. Also, add alot more garlic. I used it with baked ziti---it won't overpower.

I made this last summer when fresh tomatoes were available. This marinara sauce was listed twice, once with meatballs, which I think would be terrible. That did get bad reviews. I added a lot more garlic and served it over spaghetti. At first I was disappointed because of its mild flavor, but at the next meal discovered that it really is quite yummy. Next summer I plan on making it again and serving it with different pasta.

Lovely and light. I usually add more garlic to all recipes. The size of onions to use is medium. I use this form and color of sauce on a small tube type pasta. If using fresh oregano and basil, use more.

Very tasty and very simple. I have tried it on pizza, with meat sauce, in cacciatore and so far so good.
