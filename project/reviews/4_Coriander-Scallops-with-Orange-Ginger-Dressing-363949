Fabulous! Bright, fresh and flavorful. Will be one of my go to recipes for a quick healthy meal. I used only 1T of vinegar which I thought would provide a better balance of acidity and sweetness. Perfect!

One of my fave epi recipes. I don't have coriander seeds so I use ground coriander-- just a tiny pinch over the scallops while they cook. As the other reviewers say, reduce vinegar to 1 or 1 1/2 tablesp. I only use fresh sea scallops so I don't have problems with water coming out of the meat while cooking. I would also recommend throwing some onions in the salad mix. If you don't have OJ concentrate, reduce some OJ in the pan. The portion of 4 servings was enough for me and my boyfriend.

Made this as written except used two oranges instead of one. So refreshing. Have made it a number of times since recipe appeared and still find it a delightful surprise to the tastebuds. Other reviewers are right to make sure scallops are dried well so they brown. Also important to get the pan good and hot.

Made this recipe with chicken instead of scallops. It was fantastic. I also didn't have any orange juice concentrate, but had an orange, and so I squeezed it and boiled down the juice for a bit, added a little honey, and used that in place of the orange juice concentrate. Worked very well. This recipe had a taste that kind of blew our minds as we took the first bit--a mixture of flavors that wasn't expected but was just right.

Very easy, amazingly tasty. I followed the recipe except I used smoked ground coriander instead of the crushed seeds. Also, I roasted the scallops for about 10 minutes at 425 insterad of sauteing them. I loved the dressing so much I made it a few days later as a quick marinade for salmon, adding about 2 teas. of the ground coriander to the dressing. Delicious!

Tasty low calorie salad. I used ground coriander because I had no seeds. I also threw a few cilantro leaves in the greens mix. I think that made this dish even better. I used frozen sea scallops, so after thawing, I used a paper towel to dry them completely. That way they browned nicely and didn't "boil" in the fry pan. The salad looks beautiful, too.

Great simple recipe For the dressing, I didn't have frozen concentrate and thought it would be to sweet, so I used some orange zest for orange flavor, a small amount of orange juice and I didn not have white balsamic so I used a bit of seasoned rice wine vinegar, turned out great.

Delicious and very easy to prepare. My Dominican husband even loved it too as different as it is from his cultural dishes. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and will make it the same next time.

I just made this tonight as a quick family meal and it was fantastic. The only "change" I made was using ground coriander instead of the seeds, which I didn't have. I can't imagine it made a huge difference. The flavors went very well together and it really was easy to pull together. Like another reviewer said, I cooked the scallops about 7 minutes on each side.

This recipe would be complete with directions for cooking baby carrots, orange segments and if the greens have some cooking. Also, very good combination of flavors.

The flavors in this recipe are wonderful. But, one thing about cooking scallops is that it is important they be dried with a towel before cooking and then not crowded in the pan during cooking. Especially if the scallops were frozen. Also, we like to cook them a lot longer than this recipe says. Otherwise, they will be somewhat mushy in texture.

This was absolutely fantastic. Super fast, easy, and fresh. Perfect for a spring or summer dinner al fresco. We made very few changes to the recipe--only small alterations to use what we had on hand. Fresh OJ instead of concentrate, rice wine vinegar instead of white balsamic, and grapefruit instead of an orange. A total cinch to make and lovely on the plate!

I am surprised only 86% would make this dish again. I thought it was great. Simple to make and low cal and very tasty. I don't think I would change anything about it.

Pretty good, I didn't have OJ concentrate so I used Odwalla and threw in a little sugar. The dressing was delicious, especially the next day. Scallops are so easy, the coriander seeds were a nice touch, I have seen them used on red meat too. I do prefer the flavor of scallops in butter, not olive oil, but I know this is supposed to be a "healthy" dish. So next time I'll use butter and eat a few extra bowls of oatmeal that week :)

I would make this again and will use less vinegar in the dressing.

This was quick and easy, but I wasn't horribly impressed. I thought the orange juice concentrate was too overpowering; I would use the same quantity of orange juice if I were to do this again. The whole coriander was novel, and an interesting flavor texture mix. I had left over scallops, so the next night just put the sauce directly on them before sauteeing. It was a bit subtler and more to my liking.

I cooked this with my son who likes scallops (he is almost 12). It was super easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. Serves 4, but just the two of us ate every bite.

I'm not a huge fan of scallops but tried this recipe as my husband loves them. I have to say it was delicious and I cannot wait to make it again. The flavors work so well together. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful.

I made this dish for a couple friends and we all absolutely loved this recipe. The flavors work together brilliantly and the meal has a light and healthy feel to it.

I didn't have coriander seeds handy, so I used ground coriander and it was delicious! The dressing is something I will use to marinade pretty much anything.

I made this for my family last night. The three of us 10 and up agreed that the flavors (the dressing, the oranges, the coriander and scallops) all worked together great. But my wife and daughter hated the coriander shells. The flavor was wonderful, but they couldn't get past the texture.
