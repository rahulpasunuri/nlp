i made this soup with wild apples from my tree in the catskills, possibly even less sugary than granny smiths (and i used three times the amount, because they were smaller than your average supermarket apples). since other reviewers found the soup lamely spiced, i decided to do the cumin one better by currying the soup. added a little more than 2T of a fresh, spicy curry blend i bought at an import store; it was a madras yellow curry. the soup was a little thin so i went with heavy cream right into the pot, about a half cup to give it some body and make the soup taste richer. the result was a creamy, tangy, pungent soup that i thought might be an acquired taste, but my guests loved it and even my husband, who doesn't go for spicy, thought it was excellent. i just ate the leftovers next day, and the flavor is bold and bright. maybe not for everyone, but i loved it.

For the most part, pretty disappointing. At some point during the cooking, my friend and I realized that the only spice in this was the ground coriander. Sorry, but that's not enough. It tastes like lame, warm, applesauce soup (and not in a good way). We experimented a bit and ended up adding about 2 teaspoons nutmeg and maybe a teaspoon of salt to the pot. Then we fried up some good bacon and crumbled that on top and we both sprinkled nutmeg (a la egg nog) and salt on top of the soup. The yogurt didn't really add anything. This made it ok, but nothing to write home about. We also wondered if small cubes of ham would be good in it, and my last thought was a good Swiss cheese grated on the top (emmenthaler, maybe?). The apple flavor reminded me of how much I like apples in cheese fondue. I was waffling on "would I make it again?" The question we asked yesterday was "is it worth spending the time figuring out how to fix it, or do we just move on from this recipe and find another?" I felt like it had potential, and it was SO easy, but this is not a complete recipe. I have to say I was really surprised at Bon Appetit on this one.

Tastes like apple sauce, honestly. The yogurt helps a bit, but I won't make this again.

I've made this soup twice now within a week. The first time I made it with pears instead of apples. I like it better with the pears. The apple variety tastes a little too much like apple sauce for my liking. The pear and parsnip pairing was a little more intriguing. All my dinner guests raved. I also added a little nutmeg and a hint of cinnamon to the vegetable melange. I also forewent the yogurt, the soup seemed so delicious on its own.

Coriander or cardamom? The recipe says coriander, but a reviewer said cardamom. There is a big difference
