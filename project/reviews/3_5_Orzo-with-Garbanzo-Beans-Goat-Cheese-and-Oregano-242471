Followed the advice of other reviewers and only used one 5 oz log of goat cheese, roasted the chickpeas with cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper, added cherry tomatoes and yellow bell peppers (also served with a side of steamed broccoli). Two additional tweaks: used a whole Meyer lemon, added extra cumin, paprika, and cayenne to the whole mixture. It turned out quite well. I liked it and so did my picky teenagers.

I just made this recipe and it was pretty good. I read some past reviews and agree you have add a little something else to give it some "umph". I used dried oregano instead of fresh and cut the goat cheese to half of a 5 oz log so not so overpowering. For my "umph" I used about 2-3 tablespoons of Trader's Joe Olive Tapenade Traditional (found in the fridge section). It really added some good flavor. I think next time I will just use the Olive Tapenade with Goat cheese version and skip the other goat cheese. I also had to salt and pepper quite abit. This recipe is great base and should be experimented with to suit everyone's taste.

definitely ONE FIVE-OUNCE log...goat cheese. Added sauteed zucchini and roasted chick peas (paprika, cumin). Came out very good!

Very simple to prepare. I like to serve this with grilled tilapia. Also, I just used Parmesan instead of goat cheese.

Interesting... Something didn't taste "quite right" for me. Maybe my lemon was a bit too old. I was disappointed, I had been looking forward to making this for a while and it ended up not tasting all that great to me. Le sigh.

Upon first reading this recipe, I was struck by how monotonous this dish would look if prepared as written. Like a few other reviewers, I decided to up the oomph by adding some vegetables - I threw in some zucchini and red and yellow peppers. To enhance the taste and texture of the garbanzo beans I tossed them in spices (cumin, paprika, cayenne) and roasted them for about 40 minutes. My family and I loved the dish after that!

I found this to be a bit bland. If I choose to make it next time I will probably add some cherry tomatoes for color and perhaps roast the chickpeas first. That may solve the texture issue. The goat cheese was actually really lovely with the orzo, but feta would be great as well.

Delicious! As the other reviewers suggested, I added steamed broccoli, which went very well, and added some needed color.

I have not yet made this but I love all the ingredients and think it sounds great. For those who used huge quantities of goat cheese: I think the recipe should read 1 (one) 5 oz. log of goat cheese. I do not think there is a 15 oz. log, and 5 oz. should be plenty. Shame on the proofreader!

One more thing - some people said they substituted feta but I recommend sticking with goat cheese. The goat cheese actually melts into the dish and becomes indistinguishable and adds great creaminess along with flavor. That was part of what I liked so much about it, I don't think chunky non-melting feta would work as well.

Rating: 3
This had great flavor but I didn't think the garbanzo beans added anything at all. They actually conflicted with the smooth orzo in a bad way I thought. If I made it again I would definitely omit them. I added yellow squash so it would have some vegetables. Today I ate the leftovers with some cherry tomatoes and they were a great addition.

I made this as an accompaniment to the marinated leg of lamb recipe on this site (lemon juice, oregano, garlic) and it was fantastic. Added fresh tomatoes and used fresh oregano.

Nice. Added some tender crisp broccoli and diced tomatoes to serve as an entree. Eight ounces of goat cheese seemed like plenty--I used a garlic and herb chevre.

No goat or feta so I made it with about 3/4 cup of shredded parmesan. Turned out very well. Flavor is excellent, although I will agree the texture combination of the pasa and the beans is a bit off.

Used feta and added lemon zest, brought it to a gathering and was hit or miss with the crowd. I really like it however, and agree with a cook from Chanhassen: it is strangely addictive. I've also made it with some sauteed shitake mushrooms with great results.

For some reason the beans and pasta combo threw me off a bit. Maybe I overcooked the pasta and the textures just didn't mesh well for me. Once I got over that though, I was strangely addicted to the dish. I used feta and it was a fine substitution. And I love that the left overs will make a pretty solid lunch tomorrow.

I really like this a lot and think it's great as a potluck dish. I add broccoli (lightly steamed or blanched) to make it a vegetarian main dish (also adds great color). I bet adding shrimp or another protein would also be delicious.

I thought the goat cheese in this recipe was really overwhelming. Next time I probably will put 1/4 the requested amount. However for those who agree with me, I saved the dish somewhat by adding some pork sausage. The saltiness helped balance out the too strong creamy tartness of the goat cheese. Oh and I also added fresh sugar snap peas which also really added to the overall flavor and color of the dish.

Very good but not fantastic, maybe it needs something more. It's a good weekday dinner & easy to make.

Good as a base recipe. I added olives and tomatoes and will add onion next time. Worth it if you are willing to spice it up yourself.

A friend brought this recipe to a book club meeting and I LOVED it so I made this twice in recent weeks. Because I really don't cook (lucky me, my husband does,) The First time I improvised and forgot to balance out the herbs, cheese and oil needed to flavor all the extras I added. There were too many vegetables tomatoes, celery slices, and snowpeas. I added imitation crab as well, but again it was dry, bland, and wasn't the right balance. Tonight I made it for a 4th of July party and it was FABULOUS! I did things differently. I added about six 3-inch long tops of asparagus that I drizzled in lots of olive oil topped it with some sea salt with a 1 minute microwaving, 20- 25 Kalamata olives cut into quarters, an extra cup of cheese (more Feta than goat,) 20-25 cut cherry tomatoes, and for a FABULOUS CRUNCH,I chopped nearly a whole bag of packaged mung bean sprouts and about 10 snowpeas chopped into 3rds. It was colorful and absolutely YUMMO! Next time I make it, I will try the total Mediterranean approach with sliced red onions, Kalamata olives, Gorgonzola and Motz cheese and basil with tomatoes. I will likely add some tuna packed in oil for some protein.

This is alright as is but not fantastic. I think it's better with the following alterations: adding another T of fresh oregano and a handful of chopped parsley; subbing a good chunky feta for the goat cheese; including some of the zest of the lemon in addition to the juice. I love the idea of adding tuna, as one previous reviewer suggested! What a fantastic way to make this a main course.

Skipped the goat cheese altogether, as we are trying to be dairy free for a while...still was excellent!

I forgot to mention that I also reduced the amount of cooked orzo by about half. I think the original recipe called for too much orzo; one needs a good orzo to chickpea ratio :)

I added the tuna, used dried oregano, and accidentally forgot the lemon juice. This was fantastic with my modifications!! I ate it as a meal with some pita chips, rather than as a side. I really loved it and will definately make it again.

I made this for a dinner party and it was gone quickly. I think the color does lack some but the flavor is really great and the garbanzo beans surprised my guests. What a great side. I plated it with Lamb chops...delish.

Very good - I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added lemon zest, hot chili pepper, fresh coriander, and cherry tomatoes. I also pan fried some salmon filets, broke up the cooked fish and mixed it in with the salad. Delicious.

Love this recipe, the only thing it lacks is color. I also used dried oregano instead of fresh. (I crushed it between the palms of my hands real fine so it wouldn't overpower.) I used the juice of one lemon. I think I'll try it with feta instead of goat cheese next time and add some finely grated red pepper flakes.

This is a great and easy summer dish. To give it a bit more color and taste I add a handful or two of sun-dried tomatoes. My whole family loves it!

This is a delicious summer side dish! I would add a teaspoon more lemon juice to make it tangier, but other than that it was great!

Quick & easy. I have made this numerous times, always to rave reviews (add extra oregano -- it needs it). Make a double recipe and add one can of high quality tuna to the leftovers. This makes a great easy lunch (as the magazine noted in the original publication).

Easy and quick to make and very tasty using some reviewers' suggestions... added a healthy handful of chopped cilantro, halved cherry tomatoes (ah summer!), substituted feta for goat cheese (i'm a huge goat cheese fan but the feta holds up well here) and increased the lemon juice (used 3 big ones) plus a little zest. Added sea salt, fresh pepper and a dash of dried oregano. Will make this again. Interested in trying to add different veggies, olives, etc next time.

I agree with "A Cook from Somerville, MA." The recipe is easy but bland. I might try the suggestions of cherry tomatoes.

I'm not a big oregano fan, so I switched it for fresh cilantro. Added in between 1/4 and a 1/2 cup and have gotten nothing but rave reviews! I rarely make a dish more than once (too many out there to try) and have actually made this one 4 times now...it's great fresh and great a couple days later. I do heat it slightly in the microwave as a leftover, to at least get it to room temp; otherwise, the flavors do not come up as a good leftover. This is a wonderful picnic dish!

I liked this recipe, but it was a little bland at first, so I added some fresh basil, halved cherry tomatoes, and a little bit of parmesan. I also added only about 4 oz of goat cheese, and I thought that was even a little much. I agree with the reviewer who said some more chickpeas would be good.

A very tasty recipe. Good for a side or main. I recommend letting the orzo cool or running it under cold water or the goat cheese will melt. Also, this needs a liberal dose of pepper and salt as well. Yum!

Prepared this dish with another from the same Bon Appetit issue. Next time, I would either make a half cup less orzo or add another can of chick peas to create a better ratio. Much more lemon juice was needed to enhance the flavor of the dish - added to taste. The oregano and goat cheese were excellent. I would also consider adding roasted red pepper or another color to make the dish more visually appealing. Lastly, make sure you let the orzo cool a bit before adding the goat cheese unless you want it to melt. Wonderful at room temp.
