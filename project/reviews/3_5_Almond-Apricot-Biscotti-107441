This recipe is good. I used 2% milk and 1/2 tsp almond extract instead of 1/4 (because I love almond flavor). I'd recommend chopping the almonds into smaller pieces.

I used toasted walnuts instead of almonds, and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is really easy and delicious! It's very versatile--you can sub pretty much any fruit/nut combo. I used dried apricots, cranberries, almonds, and white chocolate chips. Second batch, eliminated almond extract and used lemon zest, cranberries, and white chocolate. GREAT! Only thing--I didn't get anywhere near 5.5 dozen!

Definately not my favorite biscotti recipe. I'm not sure if the apricots weren't just fresh enough or what, but the flavor lacked. The texture was fine and they baked nicely. This recipe was more work than other biscotti recipes I have made. Used my food processor to cut the butter and flour. Would recommend chopping the almonds as left whole made it difficult to cut nicely. I loved the idea of almonds and apricots, but this was disappointing. I will say my husband and daughter did like them. I may try them again with different apricots to see if that is where the problem was.

Great recipe! They came out wonderfully even in my half sized electric oven!! I used dates instead of apricots and they were delicious. I will definitely be making these again and experimenting with different combinations.

This is a GREAT base recipe...you have 2 cups of "stuff" to work with - for example, it calls for 1 cup almonds and 1 cup apricots. So far I have used almonds and golden raisins, almonds and cranberries and even almonds and crystallized ginger (only 1/3 cup minced) and it always comes out great! It gives you the flexibility to use whatever nuts and dried fruit you have in the cabinet!

Every Christmas I make biscotti for friends and family. I usually make 5 or 6 kinds but this one is the only that people fight over. My husband stands over the oven with a knife waiting for them to come out after the 1st baking. I usually make this recipe as is but will use white chocolate chips. I chop the almonds and apricots separately and mix them in at the end. I add apricot oil and sometimes include amaretto, depending on my mood. Let's just say I've got the recipe memorized I've made it so many times!

These are a disappointment...more complicated than they need to be and the flavor doesn't grab me. Also tried the almond anise biscotti and they were fabulous. This recipe is now ditched, not to be made again...

I'm going to try this again with 2 eggs and no milk - although the dough was very easy to handle, these did not crisp as well as the chocolate ginger recipe.

I've made a lot of biscotti in my day but I think this recipe is the best yet... sensible proportions (not too much butter, not too many eggs) and good ratios make for delicious biscotti! I subbed 1/3 cup cocoa powder for an equal amount of flour. yummm

This is the best Biscotti recipe I have ever tasted. Slicing is tricky so I have switched to sliced almonds with good results. It is a very versatile recipe and I have tried it with many different dried fruits. Most recently I used dried pears with diced crystalized ginger and replaced the milk with pear brandy. They were delicious.

I like this recipe. I chopped the apricots as well and kneaded them into the dough and they turned out very well. I want to try this with some other dried fruit we enjoy, i.e. dates.

these biscotti are very tasty. I made them in the processor with great success, chopping the apricots first.

There are a few things I'll change next time I make these. I had problems both with rolling the dough and cutting because of the whole almonds. I think next time I'll use chopped ones and maybe try some of the fruit suggestions others have made. Can't wait to try again!

I make this recipe a lot. Try dried cranberrries instead of the apricot for a holiday touch. Golden raisins are a tasty substitute too. I put the fruit in with the almonds (bypassing one step) so you do see specks of fruit on the outside of the log...which is ok with me. I also form the dough directly into the 14 inch log (forget the disk), wrap in cellophane and freeze for 1-2 hours (makes the dough easier to roll out on to parchment paper, no need for wet hands). As everyone says, the cutting is tricky...make sure you let it cool before you transfer to the cutting board (minimum 20 minutes). While some may break during the process, that's just more culls for you to eat! You can't get a bad tasting wafer from this recipe.

A great trick for slicing biscotti is to score the tops of the baked logs with a serrated knife, then slice through with a sharp chef's knife.

I had never made biscotti before. This was an easy recipe!! It did crumble a little. Next time I will flatten the log and hope it will prevent some of the natural cracking that happens when it bakes. YUM!!

definitely use a good serrated bread knife to cut! I've tried several knives and it seems to work the best. The last batch didn't have any breaks! And I didn't need to chop the almonds first.

Yikes! We didn't check the reviews before making these cookies. We ended up with biscotti crumbles. We probably ended up with 6 slices that came out perfect. A dud.

Great recipe. I only had 1 inch of parchment left so I didn't use any and everything came out fine. I sprayed a very light coating of PAM at the first baking. I also skipped the egg wash and didn't miss it. I've also made it with cranberries and it was fantastic!

Made with dried cherries and it had a good texture; not too dry. On a humid day, though, the dough is hard to work with, it's sticky and falls apart. Still a great recipe that gets lots of compliments. Will definitely make many more times.

Made three logs and froze them. Then sliced thinly and baked (much easier to slice this way). Ok, they're uniscotti, not biscotti, but they're great with coffee!

I, too, added the slightly chopped, toasted almonds and 1/4 inch diced dried apricots directly to the dough, kneading it in until well-distributed. And get out your electric knife to slice these babies; I can't believe how fast 'n' EZ this is with no crumbling. Use a big splash of almond extract, too. Crunchy-chewy goodness itself.

I'm a novice when it comes to baking, and this recipe was quite easy to make. Whole almonds and quality apricots add to the appearance - and taste - of the biscotti. A very sharp knife is absolutely necessary; using the combination of a serrated knife for scoring and chef's knife for a quick stroke made cutting the cookies a breeze. Purely by accident, I added extra almond extract; I certainly didn't regret the extra flavor. These were delicious!

I have been looking for good cookie recipes. This is a recipe that proved to be a great one. I have baked these cookies for my family and friends at work,and they loved it. skipped a few of the steps for baking them.For example,I did not cook the almonds and did not put the cookies back in the oven, after I baked them and cut . The people that tried them , said they liked the texture.A food lover.

This was a great success. Everyone in the family loved it. Using the cutting technique of scoring the top of the loaf with a serrated knife & then cutting straight through with a chef's knife was the key to a clean edge on the cookies.

This is a an easy recipe to make , as you don't need to use an electic mixer. But although the dough is rather sticky and difficult to work with, the results are certainly worth the effort. Ice cubes helped to keep my hands moist enough to form the dough into logs. Next time, I too, will shape them into three logs. I loved the idea of folding the dough over the apricots. It makes for a very pretty cookie. Using quartered apricots, and whole almonds is no problem, if you have a very sharp serrated knife like I do.(Wusthoff) This recipe will become a staple in my recipe collecion.

I've been making this biscotti recipe it was issued in Bon Appetit. It is an absolute favorite and comes out perfect every time!

These turned out really great for me. A suggestion for those of you who are having problems with your biscotti crumbling -- verify the temperature of your ovens -- believe it or not research has shown that most ovens are off, some by as much as 60 or 70 degrees. So you may not be cooking at the correct temperatures.

Based on earlier reviews I diced the apricots, which is not too difficult if you spray the knife blade lightly with a product, such as Pam. I had trouble cutting the logs at first but found a good solution. I scored the tops with a serrated knife and then used a heavy knife to separate the diagonal pieces. I placed one hand on the handle of the heavy knife and the other on top of the knife tip and pushed down firmly. No more crumbling!

These tasted fine but I was suspicious when I saw that this recipe called for whole almonds. I wondered what would happen when slicing through them and just as I suspected, the biscotti crumbled and the end product didn't look nice. Next time I will chop the almonds after toasting.

It turned out a little bitter and was very crummy and fell apart. It took a lot longer then predicted and didnt turn out too well.

The cookies have only one flaw; its those apricots. Does anyone have a wild apricot craving out there? If so, make as directed. Everyone who I served them to agreed. The apricots are both too tart and too chewy. I will make this again. But I will used either prunes (oops that is dried plums now, right?) or figs.

Rating: 3
I agree with everyone else. They taste wonderful but next time I will also chop the apricots smaller, used slivered almonds or slightly chop the whole ones and mix the apricots in like all the other ingredients. The almonds and apricots bunched in the middle of the log and were very difficult to cut nicely. I look forward to making them again.

I agree with the idea to snip the apricots, I thought they were too big as well. I toasted my almonds a little too much I think, but they were still ok. I personally like the whole almond but had forgotten to pick up almond extract and miss the extra flavor of it. I like that they aren't too sweet but added some drizzled semi-sweet chocolate to jazz them up for holiday gifts... they look impressive!

Rating: 3
These are easy to make with very nice results. I did not toast the slivered almonds prior to cooking and they were still tasty. Also, I snipped the apricots into small pieces and just mixed them into the batter with the almonds. I had to try a couple of knives before finding a thin serrated edge that worked okay. But even still it was necessary to 'hold the log together' while slicing. But that has been my experience with other recipies so I am thinking it is just characteristic of biscotti. I'll be making these again tomorrow since I am giving this batch away....

These had a nice taste but were difficult to cut neatly. I was making them as hostess gifts and had to say they taste better than they looked. Next time I would cut the apricots smaller and either chop the almonds or use sliced almonds. I just added the apricots to the mix with the almonds rather than folding them in like the recipe said to.

I'm a biscotti maker! These were very good, light, and not sweet. Next time I will cut the apricots in smaller pieces ( I must of had huge apricots!.) I used sliced almonds..take care they toast quickly! I thought the almond taste was mild and would like to try increasing that flavor. Extra almond extract..amaretto??

These have a very nice flavor, especially with the addition of 1/8 teaspoon of Fiori Di Sicilia, available through King Arthur. I wish they cut into neater slices. Mine didn't spread as a previous reviewer stated, and I found the size of the two logs just fine. If you have trouble cutting them neatly, change your knife until you find one that does a better job. I'll definitely make these again.

This such a great recipe. I really thought it would be harder than it turned out to be. Except for the almonds & apricots, anyone who bakes regularly has these ingredients on hand all the time. The A & A are so easy to come by the grocery store that this recipe is a no brainer. Thanksgiving guests raved and begged me to make again for X-mas. I do recommend making 3 logs for smaller cookies. Had I known how the dough would spread I would have opted for the three rather than 2 for larger cookies. Excellent!
