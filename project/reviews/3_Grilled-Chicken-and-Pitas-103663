I started making this when the article first came out, when I was pretty inexperienced, and am still grateful for it today. This gets you moist, delicious chicken to serve with whatever side you like, excitining, comforting, whatever...we love it.

I highly recommend this recipe - for those following a bland diet. Coupled with water to drink, and jello for dessert, this is a good time in the making!!

needed to add some grilled vegies to make it not so bland-- used grilled zuchini,tomatoes and onions--then it was perfect.
