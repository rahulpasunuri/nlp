Fantastic! Easy and delicious. I did use the beaten egg whites as suggested by others (besides it's a shame to waste them). This was perfect. Chocolaty but not too sweet. I made this the night before and had it for Easter lunch, taking it out of the frig 20 minutes before dessert. Really an impressive mousse.

I had no problem. I made it swith 61% semi sweet chocolate. I took out 1 tbls of sugar to accommodate the semi sweet difference. I did not add the egg whites mostly because I did not have an extra clean bowl to beat them. I did not cook the cream very hot and was very careful with melting the chocolate. I mixed the egg yolks very well till they were glossy and gradually very slowly added hot custard to chocolate. No lumps, no bumps, nice taste and super creamy.

I follow a low carb diet and wanted to see whether I can substitute Splenda into the recipe and still have exceptional flavor. This works VERY nicely. I used a combination of unsweetened chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate as that is what I had on hand. I whipped the egg whites with 1 TBL Splenda and substituted Splenda for the sugar in the balance of the recipe. The egg white addition makes for a very light mousse. I will definitely make this recipe again. My family thought the taste was excellent.

Made this last night for dinner party with 8 kids. Everyone customising theirs with strawberries, whipped cream, choco bits and sugar confetti. All loved scooping it up with Belgian waffle biscuits. Made it with 62 % dark chocolate and chilled for just 6 hours! Dense but rich. Will try adding the egg whites next time.

Made this for dinner for 8 people. Those reviewers who are getting a thick fudge-like result are using a chocolate with too high % of cocoa. I used 60% cocoa chips and it turned out great. The cream should be hot enough to be able to stick a finger in and not burn yourself but not want to keep your finger there either. Too hot and it will cook the yolks and make a mess. I never strain the custard, just keep as much white out of the yolks as possible and whip constantly while cooking (and do NOT heat to 160...150 is enough). I agree with several other reviewers; don't bother to melt the chocolate - just toss the chips into the hot custard and stir with a whisk (off the heat) and they melt right in. I also whipped all 4 egg whites and whisked them into the final product a little at a time until I got the right fluffy consistency and taste for me - turned out to be probably 2 of the whites. Got great reviews. Addition of some Baileys/Chambord/etc would be good.

Very good standard mousse recipe. Most do ask for egg whites, and that lightens it up-- I went ahead and put them in, it was three forks at the point that the recipe asks you to stop. I didn't find it to be terribly chocolatey (I like it rich) so I put a swirl of a thin chocolate ganache with cayenne and cinnamon.

Rating: 0
Very good Mousse recipe, but like other reviewers, you need to save the egg whites and use. i like to add a little flavor, so a 1/2 tsp of orange extract or a little condensed espresso or whatever you like instead of vanilla is a nice touch, not too much thou. mix as directed, and after adding whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, gently fold in stiff egg whites. can be put in freezer and ready in 2hrs if in a rush.

I made this recently, it was delicious! I did follow the revisions left in other comments. that was to say, i whipped the egg whites up seperately then folded them into the whipped heave cream. i folded this (the whipped whites and cream) into the chocolate concoction (of chocolate, vanilla extract, yolks, and salt. i added a bit of butter when melting the chocolate in the double boiler.) it tasted great! it sort of tasted like chocolate milk in a mousse form. but that all depends on what kind of chocolate you use- i used chocolate fondue which you may otherwise use for a chocolate fountain. nevertheless, i loved it and so did everyone who tried it!

This was quick, easy--and very very good.I halved the recipe but followed the recipe with one exception -- I used a teaspoon of orange extract because I had used Lindt Intense Orange Chocolate for the chocolate. Didn't have any orange liqueur around so used the extract.

This turned out well, but I had 70% bittersweet chocolate and it definitely made for a dense mousse when it was chilled. It still turned out delicious and I would definitely use this recipe again, maybe doing some of the recommended variations next time around...

My wife is a total chocolate mousse freak. She's tried it in multiple locations, in multiple countries, and is usually disappointed. With this recipe (which I doubled when I made it) she was to so happy with the result that she agreed to marry me! True story! I used it as part of the proposal process and she got to spend the next two days gorging on chocolate mousse and being reminded of her promise with every mouthful. I totally recommend this recipe! Seven years and still going strong...

Did this twice in the last week - the first time for Christmas dinner, then for tonight's New Year's Eve celebration. The rich decadent flavor of this mousse is incredible. (used 60% Ghirardelli chips, just melted them in the pot over direct VERY LOW heat. Worked perfect.) My first attempt came out great, but everyone is so right about only heating the custard to 150 - you can tell when it suddenly thickens and is ready for mixing. I went too hot the first time and got lumps (which, in the end, didn't matter - still worked fine) but this time I was more careful and the smoothness was there. First batch was with Grand Marnier - YUM. This batch I tried a 1/2 shot of Bailey's. It smells insanely good. If I can hold out the 6 hours for cooling without eating it all myself, our guests will love it! Mixing blackberries and strawberrys for the tops. Enjoy, fellow chocoholics, this recipe is SO good!

Maryp, I am a little confused with the egg whites being added to the whipped cream. I looked through all the reviews to frind Chef Shelly's recommendations but no luck. Are you using the 4 egg whites from the 4 yolks used earlier in the recipe?

Rating: 4
Oh my gosh...this is heaven! I followed Chef Shelly's recommendations of putting the whipped egg whites in the whipped cream mixture. However, I added a teaspoon or so of sugar to the whipped egg whites to give them a little more substance. Maybe if I left the sugar out it would have been even more light? Chef Shelly...comments? Otherwise, I followed the recipe and did not let the chocolate come to a complete cool. By the time I was done whipping the cream and egg whites the chocolate was the perfect temperature. I put the mousse into tulip chocolate cups I made, put on a few raspberries and made some piped chocolate designs to put on top. This will be this Christmas Eve's dessert....one to go in the recipe book.

I made the Chocolate Mousse but changed one thing....I saved the EGG WHITES and whipped them up in a clean separate bowl. I then added the fluffy egg whites to the cream that was whipped. My finished product was light and airy and not at all dense like so many other replies have stated. I let my custard cool only slightly before adding to the chocolate cream mix as well....and then...I only let that combined mixture set up slightly as well. I think OTHERS might of let theirs set up way to long...so as to become to firm. And when they added the cream that is whipped to the firm chocolate, ofcourse its gonna be thick. But, mine was perfect and actually became even lighter the next day. All the bubbles stayed in the mixture perfectly. I loved it....this is a keeper recipe forever and ever for me. I will always add egg whites to the whipped cream. Thank You, Chef Shelly

OMG - made this for a ladies lunceon of 30. It was a hit! I skipped the straining part- use a good whisk. I also added the vanilla into the egg yolks. As long as it gets added...folding the cool chocolate slowly into the whipped cream is paramount!

Im a professional chef, but not much experience in making desserts. I had a important dinner tasting to do for a job interview, which was a 5 course meal, and the 5th course was dessert. It turned out great, and everyone loved the dinner. Im defentily going to keep this recipe.

The texture turned out too thick after chilling. I prefer the texture at room temperature, it's softer. I liked the flavor but I don't think it has the fluffiness of mousse.

The comment they make about using a higher % of chocolate will make the mousse more dense is an understatement. I used 2 types of chocolate, 65% and 71% and I also used pure, unpasteurized heavy cream and I ended up with something more the consistency similar to the center of a truffle. It was very thick and even after sitting out on the counter for nearly an hour, it still had the consistency of a thick cold pudding, more like a frosting. It did have a very nice flavor though. The only other change I made was I substituted a shot of Baileys for the vanilla.

This is for Dragoos from Ridgefield, WA, who wrote in on 4/10/09 - I laughed out loud at her substitutions and eyeballing - what fun, and so glad it worked out.

My husband (who sous-cheffed for me) and I made this for a Christmas Day dinner with friends.

All-in-all, he and I had a lot of fun working together and then soaking up our friends' appreciation for this special dessert!

I provide the meal for a monthly ladies meeting at church. Last night I featured this recipe as the dessert. There was not one solitary drop left! I've received emails this morning thanking me for the meal, but raving about the dessert. I live in a rather rural area and wasn't able to get the bittersweet chocolate called for in the recipe, so I used Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate chips and reduced the sugar by 1 tablespoon for a double recipe. It was absolutely delicious. I will make this again, definitely! I'd like to give the Grand Marnier a try, too! So many possibilities.

Ok I'm going to get some serious groans here, this was my first mousse venture and it was 10 o'clock at night so I wanted something chocolaty, so after searching my fridge, I found 1 cup of whipping cream and two eggs, and some dark chocolate chips. Being tired, I eyeballed the temperature (wait it gets worse) and didn't read instructions thoroughly so I added the vanilla while still cooking. I didn't strain the mix (gets worse) and threw in the chocolate chips while still cooking. Then I thought hmmm I have cool whip in the freezer (anyone ready to throw me off this site yet?!) So I dumped in about 1 1/2 cups of that. It was smooth, a little fluffy and outstanding! Next time I'll shave some chocolate over the top, but I think I got away with murder here!

WOW WOW WOW... this mousse is utterly fantastic! Every mouthful is heaven. Other than heating the custard only to 150 degrees (thank you everyone for recommending that), I followed the directions to a tee. It came out fluffy and chocolatey, a perfect mousse. For an added touch, spoon it into edible white chocolate cups. Melt 1 cup chips to 1 tbs shortening for 1 minute in the microwave on 70% power, then add'l 10-15 seconds bursts if not melted. Then paint with a pastry brush onto foil muffin cups. It will take about three batches of the melted white chocolate to make ~20 cups and use all the mousse (don't do it all at once because it hardens). Let set and then chill in the fridge. It was a bit harder to eat it this way, but mini foil (not paper) candy cups would work well. I also topped it with Kahlua whipped cream (whip 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 tbs. butter and 1/2 tbs Kahlua). I served these at a girls' night gathering and saved some for my hubby and kids, and everyone LOVED it. I will make this again and again. Perfect!!!!

This is a first time I have made a mousse. I followed the recipe and in the end the mousse is a bit too thick in texture for me. I prefer the lighter, fluffier kind. It's also very chocolaty, which I don't mind, but I think I will try this one with some milk chocolate next time, or just look around for a difference recipe.

Changes, 1) replaced the vanilla with a teaspoon of peppermint essence. 2) cooked the custard to 157 degrees. At first I thought I'd cooked it too much but it turned out perfectly. 3) couldn't find 60% chocolate so used a mixture of milk chocolate and 69%. Didn't taste the final chilled product myself as it went to my sister-in-law's bridge party, but I hear that it was a success and the mixture in the bowl was certainly delicious.

I was very pleased with this recipe. It was my first time making chocolate mousse and it turned out great. I even had a five year old eat it because he thought it tasted like chocolate ice cream. I would say that the most important part of this recipe to follow is the heating up of the custard to the temperature they suggest in the recipe. Heat it over LOW heat and keep a close eye on it. It only takes a minute or two to reach the temperature, then get it the heck off the heat and pour it into another bowl to cool. If you let it get any hotter, it was turn into scrambled eggs. My custard turned out good, but I could see how it wanted to start turning into eggs. I saved it just in time.

Everyone loves this mousse, and it is unbelievably easy to make. It is not the "creamy" sort of low brow, pudding-style mousse. It is thick and rich and wonderful. I have tried using 50, 60, and 70% cocoa. The flavor doesn't seem as affected as the consistency. The recipe is right, the higher cocoa content chocolate leads to much denser mousse. I know that this sounds unbelievable, but I actually got some unpasteurized whole cream from a local farm co-op. It made the mousse *and* the whipped cream topping significantly better.

Superb! I have made this several times with only one modification: I heated the mixture to 150 instead of 160 based on several reviewers' recommendations. Perfect!

This was my first attempt at a mousse and it tasted GREAT. The texture wasn't as light & fluffy as you get in a restaurant, but that certainly didn't stop the whole family from gobbling it up. Tip: add the alcohol after the melted chocolate comes off the heat. I tried adding Tia Maria while it was in the double boiler and turned it all to fudge. I couldn't get it to melt again so rolled it flat in wax paper and then cut into little leaves for garnish. Had to melt a new bar of chocolate for the mousse. Used Godiva 65% cacao, which may explain some of the density.

I made this for my Thanksgiving dinner, and the guests went wild for it! Several said that this is THE dessert they want any time I'm hosting or bringing something. I made a double batch, and it served (big servings, I'm telling you they were going nuts for it!) 7 adults. I made the mocha variation with the instant espresso powder. The mocha flavor was good but so subtle that I don't think anyone really noticed that it was mocha per se, just that it was good. I'd add more powder if I wanted a stronger coffee flavor. I used the Ghirardelli 60% cocoa bars, they seemed ideal. I topped it with whipped cream, which was a good foil for the stiffer chocolate.

I recommend this for anyone who has not made chocolate mousse before. It is a good mousse recipe - it won't result in one of those unbelievable light, gourmet tasting chocolate mousses, but it is tasty.

Really superb recipe. I was feeling lazy and didn't care to melt the chocolate over hot water, nor take my chances with the microwave. instead, once I removed the warm custard from the heat, I stirred in the chocolate and allowed the residual warmth to melt it. Worked without a problem. In the future, I can imagine experimenting with the mousse as a filling for a layer cake. Also, what about adding rum or some other liquor?

Deliciously chocolately mousse! Wanting to fill a cake with chocolate mousse, I was encouraged that this recipe was cited as being a bit dense. It is, and therefore works perfectly sandwiched in a layer cake.

Made with Ghirardelli chocolate and the flavor was sublime.

This was excellent chocolate mousse and a very straightforward recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner last night, very rich, but wonderful! 3 guests said it was the best mousse they'd ever had. I used 70% chocolate and it was quite dense and had a dark, bittersweet flavor.

In spite of my mistakes, this turned out beautifully. The only change I'd make next time is, rather than dividing the mousse into 8 servings, I'd make more servings of smaller portions. It's very rich!!

this was a delicious dessert. i actually made this mousse to be the topping of a devils food cake-chocolate banded dessert, and it won raves! this mousse was perfect, had an excellent flavor, and the preperation was simple.

Wow, this was sooooo good. Don't bother with the thermometer; if I'd waited until it had hit 160 degrees I would have overcooked the custard. As it is it was too thick to strain and didn't appear to need straining anyway. Impressive tasting dessert and really not all that difficult despite the numerous steps.

While I enjoyed this dessert I wonder if the 'heavy' cream can be substitued with whipping cream to make this recipe 'lighter' in taste.

I always thought making chocolate mousse was a disaster waiting to happen... not with this recipe! Despite the number of steps that had to be coordinated it came out like a dream (and all I could find for chocolate was Hershey's Special Dark.) I can't wait to try this recipe with a good European dark chocolate. I took the mousse to my Cooking Club's French night and everyone loved it. Most couldn't finish a full serving because it's so rich, but it was a hit.

What a delicious recipe! I used Lindt Bittersweet chocolate and it tasted wonderful. This was my first attempt at making a custard and was very careful to cook it just until it thickened slightly. Don't bother using a thermometer.

I made this dessert for Xmas Eve dinner -and it was really good. Beware, don't put the mousse in large portion glasses - even a champagne glass filled at 75% was too much for most people to finish. Very good - very rich!!

The best chocolate mousse I ever made. Like others, I did not use a thermometer, but stirred until it became slightly thick. Especially good with sweeetened vanilla laced whipped cream.

This was easy to make and just delicious. Next time I will skip the thermometer and simply stir the cream mixture until it becomes nice and thick. I paired this with a gorgeous Raspberry dessert wine (from Southbrook Farms winery for all you Ontario readers) and it was a big hit with my guests.

I'm on a chocolate high. This was so rich and delicious. I didn't strain and it still came out fine. Used Scharffen Berger 70%.
