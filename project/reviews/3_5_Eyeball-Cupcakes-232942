they were "ok" nothing to write home about. The frosting I didn't like at all. Much to sweet. Next time I will by boxed frosting instead.

I plan on making these today. FYI, I found the batter recipe that was not included. It is from the book "Hey There Cupcake". I googled the recipe from the book and got the recipe for those that care. Otherwise to others, great idea to use a box mix but I'm a from scatch person. I can always detect a box cake.

I too used boxed mix/frosting. I made them for a restaurant I managed and these were an amazing hit for the kids who came in (they were given one free for Halloween.) Of course, we waited til the kids were finished eating...Moms loved the idea and the kids ate 'em up! I have made them over and over. Terrific recipe. For a scarey (almost psychotic) rave for Halloween? Do a google search (no recipe on EpiC) for cat litter cake!!!

As you can see below, there is no recipe on the website for the cake itself. No wonder folks said they liked a boxed cake better. Clever idea, though. I am making it with sugar cookies. # White paper cupcake liners # 1 recipe batter for # 1 recipe Vanilla Butter Cream Frosting # Red food coloring # Pastry bag and small round tip # Small black jelly beans # Round candies with hole in the middle

I love the look of these cupcakes but I have to say I cheated and used boxed cake mix and premade frosting. HOWEVER, I also used refrigerated sugar cookie dough and made these as cookies as well. They turned out so cute! The kids just loved both and everyone raved about them! Was so fun to do! I also used all colors of the gummis and the upside down chocolate chips as recommended.

I didn't really care for the cake or the frosting. They looked fun - but I've had better cupcakes from a boxed cake.

I gave this recipe four stars for the folloiwng reasons: 1.) Cake portion was delicious 2.) Frosting was easy to work with ( I used a coloring gel from a William Sonoma xmas kit I had and it made the icing quite red, unlike the problem expressed by another baker) 3.) It was extremely easy, kids can be included in the process. 4.) The kids at the party where they were brought devoured them. Tip: I think I baked mine for longer than the time suggested in the recipe and if in doubt, better to underfill the cup than overfill as if they spill out like a muffin when baked, they are harder to decorate. I used gummy lifesavers (all colors) and mini chips.

I had to make these quickly so I used store-bought mix, icing, red writing gel, mini chocolate chips, and gummy lifesavers. They turned out great! No complaints from the kids that they weren't from scratch. :)

I just made these - taking them to a Halloween party tonight. I'll rate them tomorrow. My only complaint is that I coulnd't get the "red" icing red - it turned out pink no matter how much food coloring I put in. We'll see how they go over tonight!

Made these for a get together for the local VFW yesterday. My kids helped and had a ball doing it. They were a hit with everyone. I followed the advice of others and used mini chocolate chips for the eyeballs. Very easy.

My husband and I are in the middle of making our third batch of these. We've taken them to two parties and now we're making them for his office. Everyone has loved them and they're OH SO YUMMY!! We thickened our frosting just a bit more and used mini chocolate chips for the pupils (turned flat side up) because we didn't like the look of the jelly beans. We used all the colors of gummy lifesavers, not just the green, and they look fabulous!

It was fun to do with the kids! I did have a bit of a challenge finding green "irises", but just bought lots of gummy life savers! The look is perfect for the first and fifth grade class parties tomorrow. Glad to have found this.
