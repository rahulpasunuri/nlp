Had made these beans several times, and they were good, but for me not perfect. So I changed things up a bit and now, every time I make them, someone wants the recipe. 1/2 cup molasses 1/4 cup dry mustard 12 slices bacon cut into 1/2 pieces 1 cup onions 1/4 cup REAL maple syrup 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 2 bay leaves 1 teas salt 1 teas pepper Using the bacon, eliminates the 'too salty' and the maple syrup replaces the sugar and adds an extra flavor, as does the extra dry mustard.

I thought this was great! It's become our regular baked beans recipe. We add extra mustard, maybe twice what's called for, and the extra flavor is great. I like the simplicity and flavor.

Perfect and simple. One thing, though; I use brown sugar and I cook the whole thing in my crock pot! You don't need to soak the beans either. Just put your beans in crock pot, add the rest of the ingredients, cover with water and let it cook. Add more water if necessary. It's great if you're having a cookout, very easy.

You must throughly and repeatedly rinse the salt pork before you use it in the manner that this recipe suggests. Otherwise the beans are way too salty as the cook from N.H. states

Too salty! I had to add sugar and vinegar at the end just to make it palatable. After doing so, my husband loved it though. I think if I made this again I would decrease the amount of salt pork to 1/8-1/4 pound.
