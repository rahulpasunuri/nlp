So easy and so delicious. Used lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper and less butter than called for. Light & creamy without any cream or milk. Will definitely make this again.

It was super easy to make but a bit too salty & buttery. I would use 4tbs of butter and 1/2 tbs salt.

Added to the recipe box tonight. Loved it as is but added some raw cheddar on top when reheating and a sprinkle of S&P- was even better- but excellent just the way the recipe is written.

I have had this recipe in the back of my mind for a while but I just got around to trying it. We LOVED it. This is perfect because my husband hates really heavy cream based potato dishes. It was also so easy we will be making this all the time.

I made this recipe with some modifications...thanks to the many reviews! I used the hash brown potatoes that you can buy in the refrigerated section because I didn't have a potato slicer. Also - since some of the reviews noted a lack of flavor, I used McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Chicken flavoring. And I put some parmesean cheese on the top. They were so, so good! If you use the Montreal Chicken flavoring, definitely use low sodium chicken broth.

Here I am again a year later, making this for a party of 30 or so. I have so much confidence this will again be a great dish, especially with prime rib. Anyway, does anyone remember the Edna Lewis story and her fruit cake recipe published, I think back in the 80's? I miss the Gourmet magazine!

This was a huge hit for our Canadian Thanksgiving...I am still hearing about it. I did add in fresh parmesan and some extra pepper for taste...it was Deeeelish!

I made the recipe exactly in accordance with the directions and thought it was delicious (as did all of my guests) and easy. It tasted like it had cream in it.

We love this recipe! I usually add a couple of tablespoons of parm cheese, tsp of garlic powder and onion powder and sometimes, a bag of frozen broccoli too.

This is a very simple but delicious potato casserole that I have made many times according to the recipe. I've sliced the potatoes using a knife and also with a mandolin. It goes much faster using the mandolin and I like having potatoes with the same thickness throughout. The finished potatoes do stick a bit to the bottom of the pan, but with just a little scraping with a spatula, you can get them off. I love the textures of the potatoes- they are soft and buttery and there's plenty of delicious crust and texture from the potatoes browning and sticking to the pan.

I think the whole point to this recipe is how amazing a simple treatment of a few humble ingredients can be. This isn't meant to be haute cuisine, it's meant to be what it is, and that is an amazing potato dish that you won't believe tastes as good as it does with what you put into it. I make gratins frequently, and I love a complex layering of flavors and ingredients. But sometimes, you just want good old comfort food, and this is definitely that. This would also not be out of place on a plate with a protein that was extremely flavorful, or with a complex treatment.

When I made this the first time I liked it (see review below), but my boyfriend thought that it was bland, so when I made this again recently, I made a baked potato for him. This time, however, I added a clove of garlic, a lot of pepper, and some freshly chopped rosemary. My boyfriend ate at least half of it this time, and thought that it was awesome. It went perfectly with a pork roast. So basically, I would highly recommend adding some garlic and fresh herbs.

Great! Add 1/2 Onion, Ham (3 cups) Peppronia 1 cup. Parboil potatos. You will come back for more!

Very yummy. I oiled well, but I still had sticking. A simple delicious dish with roast chicken and red cabbage.

I loved this potato dish. Easy and a nice change from mashed or baked. Will definitely make again.

I liked this recipe a lot. It was very simple and almost bland, but it was comforting in the sense that it tasted like something my grandmother would have made. I made it with fried chicken and it was a nice, simple meal. I used 4 instead of 5 tbs of butter, and it still tasted very buttery. Net time I'll probably use only 2 in an attempt to make this a rather healthy recipe. I didn't have a problem with sticking, but if I use less butter, I'll probably use some non-stick spray. I will also add some diced fresh herbs next time (any kind would be good), and I'll use a larger pan to get more of the top crispy surface layer. If you use a madoline (and even if you don't --it's not that many potatoes!), this recipe is INCREDIBLY easy and yummy.

Made as described, using glass 2.25qt rectangular pan -- no problems with sticking on the bottom. I sliced the potatoes by hand, the long way, & it turned out fine. Tasted almost like it had cheese added -- the broth & butter is a great simple combo. Reheated it tonight with some more cheese, just to get more fat -- yum! [But could also imagine it being good and better for you: with less butter, no cheese, skin left on, etc.]

I thought this was a fantastic potato recipe. It was super easy, a little time consuming slicing, but worth the effort. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe grease the pan a little better, since they did stick to the bottom.

Do you need to use a mandoline, or were you able to get them thin enough with a knife?

A simple, easy dish to go with many things. My partner kept asking what was in this and could not believe it was so simple.

I came at this recipe with an open mind after reading the two different camps of opinion. I oiled the pan, spread the potatoes out so they would get really crispy and followed the recipe. But what turned out was pretty bland and not memorable. My boyfriend got home just as they were coming out of the oven and also thought it was really underseasoned and needed something, like tobasco, cheese, something to make it pop. We also thought it would be much better if you made it on the stove in a cast iron skillet and pressed down the potatoes, ala Spanish tortilla.

This was YUMMY! Very simple and delicious. It doesn't need a thing. This dish is a great compliment to a meal with complex flavors. The butter and broth make the potatos taste rich (but not too rich). I will definately make this again.

This will be our new potato staple. Very delicious & simple. Yes, I agree, spray the pan first. I could have just eaten the potatoes.

I loved this recipe, it's so simple with very little ingredients and it turned out wonderful & crisp. Take the advise of firstly spraying a 9x13 pyrex pan with cooking spray, then laying the potatoes out. Everyone at the table loved it!

Excellent. My son-in-laws emptied the pan nearly before anyone else received any.

Good basic "Tater" Casserole, but i am a meat and tater man so i added some browned sausage and onions to the broth when it is added in and the last few minutes uncovered i also topped it with sharp cheddar. Sorry it just needed some help.

Sounds great!

Could use some punching up. For a just a basic potato recipe, this is about a 2 fork receipe. Add some cheese or some hot sauce or a little red pepper. It needs something.

You Needed to write out a recipe for This!? Yes, I'll make this again because this has been a quick stand by with just about every starch, veg, and even meat my entire cooking Life!

It was good, but not that exciting. Sort of like potatoes au gratin without the au gratin. The top layer of potatoes tasted the best, so if I ever make it again I will use a larger pan for more surface area.

Very tasty and couldn't be easier. I even cheated a little since I was in a hurry and microwaved them first and then put in the oven. Cut the time in half.

I made this for my mother on Christmas Eve. She wanted to add onions or cheese to it but I insisted that we not tamper with the recipe. When it was done she was shocked at how good it was. This is probably the tastiest potato recipe I know of.

I rate this - yummy! It tastes like the potatoes that are roasted next to beef or chicken in the oven, but, well, lighter! (Yes, even with all that butter.) Very savory and flavorful, I was already a fan of Miss Lewis, this just cements it!
