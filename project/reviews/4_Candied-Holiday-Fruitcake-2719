OK, my family is not crazy about citrus peel or too much candied fruit, so I substituted dried apricots, dried cranberries and golden raisins for about half of the fruit. Cake was a teeny bit dry, so next year I will soak dried fruit in orange juice before adding. Still..... a very nice fruitcake. Will make again next year.

I have prepared this recipe 2 years in a row and it turns out beautifully each time. My family, most whom dislike store bought fruitcake, agree that this is the best they've had. I also age this for about 2 weeks with Appleton rum applied every 2nd day and wrapped in cheesecloth which gives it an extra flavour and moistness that is well loved.

Hello from An American Kitchen in Rio. Again I bless epicurious.com. Recipes for Christmas fruitcakes are not to be found here. The Brazilians prefer Pannetone made with candied fruits or chocolate drops. Very nice, but when an American dreams of Christmas fruitcake the best she can do it bake one herself. I eliminated the lemon extract and used one tablespoon of my own homemade vanilla. I can not find the real stuff here so I covered some split vanilla beans in vodka. After 2 weeks I had a perfect extract. I substituted nearly all the fruit and nuts for what I found locally. 200grams of walnuts, 200grams of Brazil nuts (castanhas do pará) 200grams of dried apricots,200grams of bananada (a sticky sweet type of candied banana)and 200grams of dates. Everything was roughly chopped or quarted with sissors. I divided the dough between 3 small bundt pans. The day after baking I spooned a concoction of high quality apricot preserves heated with brandy over the cakes. I then piped white buttercrean icing stars around the top edge. We served it very cold to facilitate slicing. All of our guests had triple servings!!

I have made this recipe every year since it first appeared in the magazine. My family LOVES it -- actually I make several each year since my husband's co-workers always request one. The only change I make to the original recipe is that I use vanilla extract instead of lemon. Otherwise, I make no changes. This is a very light, or "blonde" fruitcake, very moist and not at all like the traditional, dark cake.

This fruit cake was very good. We were looking for a recipe to fit a fancy bundt pan we got as a wedding present. We couldn't find "candied" fruit so we just used regular dried fruit. Also, we could not find dried orange peel so we substituted dried apricots instead. We think it worked out great. It is a very pretty presentation too with the powdered sugar. One tablespoon of lemon extract is a bit much. I think perhaps half a tablespoon would suffice. We would definitely make it again.
