Absolutely love this recipe! Have made it many times. We always have potatoes on the side to soak up any extra sauce. the pan scrapings from the meat really add depth to the saucde. Just can't say enough about it!

We had this dish at Acqua al 2 in San Diego. I made it with your recipe. The sauce should be made the day before; it takes more than 10 min to reduce and it needs a bit of sugar. BUT, it is the most wonderful sauce I have ever tasted. I make this recipe again and again and I am never disappointed.

Just got back from San Diego, which has an Acqua Al 2. According to the chef, they don't use white wine (port alone). Furthermore, as mentioned in the comments below from New York, NY, this is finished with cream. Overall an excellent recipe that I have made many times, but like others I have made modifications (added shallots, etc). In the end, I use a merged version of this and http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Beef-Tenderloin-with-Roasted-Shallots-Bacon-and-Port-4542

Great recipe. For those who said it was too runny you need to reduce a bit further and not add any flour as it is unnecessary. Great flavors and really adds a touch of class and taste to filet.

My first words after the first bite were, "oh, yum." I've made this dish twice. The first time I used a '05 Monmousseau Vouvray white wine. It was a bit too sweet. The next time I used a Pinot Gris, much better! I also added an additional three tablespoons of unsalted butter to the ending sauce. Mmmmm. This dish goes very well with the Asian Salad w/ Orange and Avocado; and Risotto Con Parmigiano-Reggiano.

I've made this several times, and it's always a big hit. The sauce is great, but it does take some time to reduce, so I reduced it to the proper consistency ahead of time, and left it on the stove to reheat just before the filets were done. To add richness, I used a teaspoon or two of demi-glace, which made a big difference. Rather than cook the filets as in the recipe I put mine on the grill. Yummy!

Very good, and easy wine reduction sauce. We like to treat ourselves to grilled filet mignon from time to time, and it's nice to have a simple sauce to dress it up. I don't recall exactly how long it took to reduce the sauce, but I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing - I simmer it to the desired taste and consistency, regardless of what the recipe says. A sprig or two of fresh rosemary is good simmered in the sauce too, remove before serving.

My husband and I cannot say enough great things about this recipe. The liquid did take about twice as long to reduce as specified - boil for 16 minutes rather than 8. I would also recommend using a really, really high quality balsamic vinegar, preferably one that has been barrel aged. They are thicker and sweeter than regular balsamic. We used one for this dish, and the sauce came out deep, rich and intense with a hint of sweetness. Perfect!

This is so good and so simple. It took 16 minutes to reduce the liquid. After I cooked the steaks, I sauted some thick slices of white mushroom before completing the sauce. We had this with baked butternut squash pieces (sugar, cinnamon, cumin and salt) and a puree of artichoke as taken from another recipe from this site.

Rating: 4
The problem many had with too thin of a sauce was that they didn't reduce it long enough -- it takes closer to 15 minutes as opposed to 8. Our sauce was very thick and everything was awesome! Take your time, don't rush things and you will thoroughly enjoy this dish!!!

I travel to florence for business and had this recipe at Acqua Al 2 . I was so blown away with this dish that when I came back to the states I searched for this recipe and was thrilled to see it was exactly from the place I discovered the dish. It was pretty close to the same although my sauce was a bit too thick, must have reduced it too long. Next time will try to broil or sear in order to get a nice crusty exterior like the restaurant version. Also I use a premium aged balsamic from Sonoma & Williams which gives extra depth and flavor. This scumptous dish is now a pemanent addition to our week !

It was good, but I didn't think this was that great. The sauce was very thin as previous reviews stated. I took the advice and added mushrooms after the beef was removed. I even added some butter and flour at that point to make a roux. But when the sauce was finished it was still very runny and tasted mainly of the port. I think it could use some more seasoning and thickening. I don't think I will make this again as there are other recipes along the same line that we enjoyed a lot more

This is a regular for us. Easy to make and the flavors are outstanding.

Delicious,and so easy. I did not change a thing. I made the sauce before and just heated it in the microwave before adding it to the pan, a winner. We like tenderloin fairly rare, so I cooked it less long on each side ( 2 to 3 minutes)

I made this recipe with pork tenderloin (seared on the stove then finished off in the oven) instead of beef, and am glad I did since the sauce is slightly sweet. Other than the meat substitution, I made it as written, but due to other reviews used a little kneaded butter at the end to thicken. In the future I will make sure I use a really dry white wine, explore thickening options and perhaps experiment with a better quality port; however, I'll definitely keep using pork tenderloin, which I think works well with port... even the cheap stuff!

Rating: 3
Very tasty! I followed others' suggestions and added shallots & mushrooms after removing beef. It took a lot more butter & olive oil to keep it going though. I used half & half instead of heavy cream and it separated. I also found the sauce too runny. I added honey & sugar to balance out the acidity of the balsamic (I used the cheap stuff). However, when we went back for seconds (about 1/2 hr. later) the sauce was PERFECT. It really does take much longer to reduce not only the right consistency but also the right flavor.

very good! made just as written, and we thought it was a great dish. served with green veg, and neat squares of scalloped potatoes and finished with chocolate souffle (epicurious g 2/02) for a feast of a meal. so easy to make too. with multiple skillets, this could be done for a special dinner party of 6, no problem.

I really enjoyed this sauce. I would definitely make this again and again. The only thing I would change is to make sure I have some Italian bread around to sop up the sauce.

Yum! I made this with 1 1/2 inch thick rib eye steaks instead of tenderloin and it was still wonderful. Sauce was great, wonderful flavor. Served with horseradish mashed potato, fresh sauted green beans and mixed baby greens with olive oil and lemon juice. Great dinner!

Wow! Yummy! I did play with the sauce a little bit - adding red wine and salt and fresh ground black pepper until I got the desired consistency and taste. I added sauteed shiitake mushrooms and served it over blue cheese mashed potatoes. Also think it would be wonderful served over polenta. I didn't pour the sauce over the meat, but drizzled it on the plate and arranged everything on top of it. Will make it again this weekend!

Maybe 2 1/2 forks but not worth all the rave reviews. I followed the recipe and found the sauce to be too runny and lacking flavor. I added a sauteed shallot and sliced mushrooms which added a little interest. There are better filet recipes out there.

Made this for my son-in-law's birthday. He loved it and said it was even better than anything he'd eaten in a restaurant. I loved the sauce and although some thought it was too thin, I felt it was just right. The taste was sublime as if I had spent hours making the sauce. I did use 10 yr. old aged balsamic vinegar instead of regular balsamic. I don't know if that gave the sauce the added kick that others felt was missing.

This sauce was ok. I felt it needed something to give it a little more body. If I make this again, I will add rosemary and maybe thyme.

I actually was just in Italy and took a cooking class from the main Chef who came up with this recipe at Acqua in Florence and this was one of the recipes we made. It was fantastic! The chef actually added a small amount of heavy cream to the sauce at the end to thicken it up. Highly recommend it!

This was good but not great. Sauce was too thin. I didn't bother with the flour as I felt this would "sully" the fillet. Next time I'll thicken sauce a bit.

I added a portabello mushroom, sliced, into the sauce and it was wonderful. The mushrom soaked up the flavor of the wine and port and complemented the steaks nicely.

I agree with the others that have rated this dish. It is so simple, you don't expect it to be so good. I don't like my steak dredged in flour, though. Next time I will try it without, and try to thicken the sauce another way.

My entire immediate family - from ages 18 to 54 - say this is the best steak they have ever eaten. The credit, of course, goes to the sauce. However, instead of using butter for the steaks, simply place sea salt in a hot skillet and then add the steak. Cook until it feels done.

With the addition of shallots to the sauce, plenty of freshly ground pepper to season the beef and a liberal finish of butter, this is my husband's all time favorite dish. It never fails to receive rave reviews and is so easy to make.

This was incredibly easy and very good. I only had red wine on hand and since we've had a snow storm today, had to make do without the white. I will try again and see the difference. I did add a few tablespoons of shallots to the pan when I added the reduced port/wine and it added a nice flavor. Mashed potatoes went great (as they always do). I never give 4 so don't let the three forks stop you from trying this really easy dinner.

This is wonderful! And so easy!

Wonderful!!! The sauce was so smooth and rich tasting. I did add a couple of tablespoons of chopped shallots to the drippings after the steaks were done. Be careful not to overcook the steaks. I cooked ours 4 mins on a side but they still cooked while they were tented--to about medium. They were about an inch and a half thick! I'll make this again and again!!

Yummy...This sauce was absolutely delicious! Instead of using white wine like the recipe calls for, I used red wine, since it was the wine I wanted to serve with dinner. It was great - the nice Port flavor was still very prominent. The final sauce had nice sweet flavor and a rich dark color. I also added 2 chopped shallots to the pan and sauteed them before adding the reduced wine mixture ... I think they added a lot of flavor to the sauce. I served the steaks with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus and it was a perfect and easy meal! I will definetely make this sauce a lot in the future. It really elevated a boring steak to a gourmet dinner.

We made this twice (so far) and it is an extremely flavorful way to make a good cut of meat. Some of the guests thought the sauce was a little too sweet the first time so I used Cabernet instead of Port the second time. We liked the Cabernet version better, but either is excellent.

This is a fine dish but I prefer the port-shallot sauce that appeared in the February 1977 issue of Bon Appetit to this version. If you have back issues of the magazine, I'd look that one up instead. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the recipe on-line.

I would roast a tenderloin butt 10 minutes on each side on a sloped coals covered grill (for rare) and pour the sauce over the meat slices(1/4") on each plate. I would add 1 tsp of arrowroot or corn starch to the sauce to thicken if grilling the beef.
