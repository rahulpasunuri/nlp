I like this type of recipe much better when the asparagus is roasted. The roasting takes the bitterness out of the asparagus and then it pairs better with the egg and parmesan. On my blog, Spoons to Sporks wrote about the roasted asparagus and egg version. It makes a great breakfast.

I found this recipe after searching "eggs and asparagus", since that was pretty much all i had in the fridge. it is super easy and tasty. i added pancetta and sauteed onions as well as a squeeze of lemon after it came out of the oven. good stuff.

I didn't use enough cheese.

I gave this three forks on behalf of my husband, who said this recipe is a "10." I don't quite agree, although it was tasty and easy. It's a simple dish that allows each ingredient to really shine through.

This was simple and delicious! Husband and our 10-yr-old both were raving about it! I did add some julienned ham to the dish but otherwise made it as written. Will definitely make again.

I liked that this recipe was really easy and fast. As the previous cooks have said, adding bacon to this really makes it.

Easy and excellent tasting. Asparagus goes very well with the eggs and makes for a special brunch dish. I substituted gruyere for the parmesan and it was great.

Great dish for a weekend brunch. You can use half of the asparagus.

This is a delightful dish, but I have invented my own egg and asparagus dish with bacon that I really prefer for a special Sunday breakfast: 4 strips bacon, diced, cooked crisp and drained 2 Asparagus stalks, sliced in 1/2" to 1" lengths and lightly steamed (I use the microwave) 2 large eggs, 1 separated, the white beaten and the yolk combined with the other egg. Grated premium Italian cheese, as much as you like Combine all ingredients in a suitable gratinee dish and bake at 350 degrees until puffy and slightly brown.

This dish was yummy and very easy to make. I added some fried pancetta torn into little bits before topping the asparagus with the eggs, which made a more complex mixtures of flavors. used about half the amount of asparagus--can one person really eat 3/4 lb of asparagus? my husband raved and requested it be served again soon.

This is a nice week-end breakfast recipe. It's so easy but you have watch closely so that the egg doesn't overcook.

I often make a recipe which is similar to this. However, I preheat the oven to 500 degrees and cook the eggs in a oven friendly pan, on the stovetop, until almost set, then put it in the oven for three minutes. It is never runny and the dish is superb! It is good as a breakfast with a baguette with fresh strawberry/or orange marmalade jam....or a good dinner with great bread, and a fabulous red wine. Give it a chance...it can be a really impressive, easy dish. I cover the parmessan (fresh,grated) at the last minute over the entire dish, asparagus and all, and it is wonderful!!!! Bon Appetit'

A great quick and light weeknight supper - my husband hasn't stopped raving since his first bite. We cut the quantity of butter and parmesan substantially (but used a really good parmesan).

This is a lovely brunch recipe. I roasted the asparagus,added some frizzled prosciutto before adding the eggs,and some toasted italian bread crumbs before the oven time. This of course changes the whole recipe, but the spirit of it remanins the same.

this is similar to a dish we had it Tour France, except the eggs were poached. My family used to love it. Alas, the children are all grown now, and as they say, "taste change".

To Alec Marin Couldn't e- you. Drizzle Truffle Oil over plated food. My source for Truffle Oil dried up and I don't remember the particularly fine and expensive brand. "Gocce"? Currently using "Bianchi" - adequate- not great. Please let me know how you like the dish and the name if you find superb Truffle Oil stanbee@mailcity.com

This recipe is OK but BAKED EGGS WITH TOMATO-HAM SAUCE AND ASPARAGUS (also available through epicurious.com), though more work, is much better.

We tried this recipe this weekend and both thought it was delicious - we're making it often during asparagus season. My husband told me that the time in the oven was too long for runny yolks - I didn't believe him as I invariably follow recipes exactly the first time. He was right - next time I make it I will reduce the oven time, so the recipe will have a more sauce-like consistency.
