We make this recipe for waffles every weekend. Skip the orange zest and the chocolate. Add a touch of vanilla. I make the mix the night before. So it only takes a few minutes in the mornig to have fresh wafles. EASY!

There were no oranges to be had, so I cut a little bit of milk and oil and added a mashed banana instead. Fabulous! Easy!

I was in the mood for chocolate chip pancakes and found this recipe and read the reviews. They were scrumptious! I added a little vanilla flavoring for taste as another reader did and used regular sized chocolate chips. I also found the pancakes to be a little heavy, but the waffles I made with the same batter were perfect! You really can't go wrong when there's chocolate in a recipe.

Very good recipe; however, I would only use 1 egg next time. It tasted too much like fried egg pancakes. Thanks so much!

these were too bready for my liking, they were rather dense and cakey. i added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla which complimented the chocolate chips nicely.

Very good. Makes enough pancakes for 4 people. I added a little extra orange zest and was happy with that decision. Wife loved it, but now we have all these leftovers.

I added a shot of Grand Mariner and doubled the recipe. I substituted Orange oil for the orange zest. Make sure to decrease the amount of milk proportionately. I also made waffles instead of pancakes. With ham or sausage, this has become a standard Sunday night easy dinner. The children love it, and will fight for leftovers.

the serving size and the preparation instructions don't quite match: if you want 4 individual pancakes, it's a 1/2 cup of batter, otherwise you end up with 8 cute mini pancakes. They're delicious, especially for chocolate fans, but they're not quite fluffy enough. I also found the accompaniment a poor replacement for syrup, butter, or whatever you normally put on your pancakes. it masked the orange/chocolate flavour.

I substituted whole milk, used 3 tbsp melted butter, added 1 tbsp Mexican vanilla and 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg. I omitted the chocolate chips, and the pancakes were AMAZING and plenty sweet. I am high altitude too, and they were fluffy and perfect. Great recipe!

This is an easy quick and very tasty recipe. I substiuted blueberries for the chocolate/orange mixture and found that to be great. One downside is that the pancake had rather a strong flavor of eggs, perhaps i'll try medium sized eggs next time.

These were a great way to start the week. I'm definitely adding this to my pancake repetoire. Note: the marmalade butter is a must. It really brings out the orange in the pancakes.

The light orange flavor was a nice addition to this standard recipe for chocolate chip pancakes. I will definitely make this again, though next time I might add a little sugar and cut back on the chips.

This is really a 3.5, but I rounded up. I made these for breakfast this morning as an alternative to our usual buttermilk pancake recipe. It was great, especially considering that it was easily made with ingredients that were on hand. I made these as waffles, but otherwise made no changes.
