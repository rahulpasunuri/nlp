I LOVE recipes with just a few ingredients, as they all speak for themselves. I followed to a T, but used our homemade vanilla rum, which is simply a vanilla bean soaked for a few months with good quality darker rum. I made the custard the day before, just because that's how our plans worked out, and it still worked beautifully. We served it over a mixture of fresh summer berries. Simplicity at its best.

Used Marsala instead of rum. Easy to make and loved the consistency. Liked better than our traditional warm Zabaglione made without the whipped cream added at the end. Served it with fresh raspberries. YUM!

This makes for a very lovely saboyan. Or, if you're like me, and accidentally add the full cup of cream to the custard mixture, a great creme anglaise. I made the pineapple-ginger upside down cake (Bon Appetit, May 2006), and used the rum/pineapple liquid leftover from soaking the pineapple slices, so it has a nice tropical flavour.

My boyfriend and I made a trifle using this and the Gramercy Tavern gingerbread cake. The rum went really well with the gingerbread and people are still raving about it!

More like a cross between a mousse and a sabayon. I used it intead of a custard for a chocolate banana trifle and it was great. I think the amount of rum masked the egg smell which I find so offensive in other sabayons.
