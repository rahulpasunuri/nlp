1 hour 10 min at 450 deg is way too long for this recipe. My onions were burned to a crisp and the potatoes had a bitter note. My box of Lipton Onion Soup had a similar recipe right on the box and it recommended cooking for 35 min at 425. I might try the rcipe again according to those instructions.

Delicious and so easy! We used new potatoes, quartering them. We used only half of the envelope of the onion soup mix. Thanks to the reviewers who suggested lining the roasting pan with foil!

So easy and delicious but you must be an onion lover :)

I am in LOVE with these potatoes! They were so delicious - all my guests raved and scraped the platter clean. I doubled the recipe and used 2 pans - if you do this I would suggest maybe cutting down the oil as its harder to get a good crisp.New potatoes worked well and the onions are soo delish so don't skimp.

Pretty easy and really good! I used Rosemary because I didn't have Marjoram and it turned out fine.

Have made this several times and will continue to do so as it's always a hit. Simple and tasty. Doubles well as long as size of pan is increased.

The taste was too too strong, I didnt like it at all.

I used new potatoes and cut them in quarters-as suggested by another reader. They were so yummy, my husband is asking for them again tonight! I added a little cayenne pepper for a little kick.

I'd like to give this 3.5 forks! It's the best roasted potatoe recipe I've tried, and I've tried a lot. I made mine with small red potatoes, quartered. Delicious!

Great recipe...got rave reviews from family.I found that the onion soup made the taste a little strong, but that is just my taste...everyone else devoured them.

We liked it just as it was spec'd. We would try it with parsnips next.

Fabulous! I didnt have the onion soup mix, so i just omitted it. Turned out so good! My boyfriend could not shut up about them! Will definitely make them again with the onion soup, but they were great without too!

Very nice. Makes a small amount. I would double. Also I didnt use the marjoram as I had none. Note: onion soup mix is awesome with potatoes.

I made this dish for our annual block party. I doubled the recipe and it was the 1st dish to disappear! I noticed adults as well as children liked these potatoes.

One word - fabulous! My husband said that these were the best oven roasted potatoes that I've ever made. They were very easy - I followed the recipe exactly. I took the advice from San Diego (thanks)and foil lined the pan. I will make these again and again!

Delicious and very easy! I might try using a bit less oil next time.

WOW! I did a "naked steak" in a stove top grill pan.(hickory smoke salt & pepper). Steak was GREAT, but family members were swiping their steak through the potatoe mixture. Made 4 servings for 3 of us. Got to the kitchen to snarf up the left overs. Ha! No left overs!

Decidedly simple and quite good. I have made two changes. First I've added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic (more if you like the the herb), to the mix, Toss, let stand about 2 to 5 minutes, toss again, then procede. Secondly, I fully line my baking dish with aluminum foil... clean-up is absolutely simple by doing this.
