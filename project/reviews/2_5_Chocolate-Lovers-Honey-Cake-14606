This cake was outstanding. Based on the other reviews, I decreased the cinnamon a bit and also lowered the oven temp a little. I used a 9-inch square pan. The cake rose a full two inches to the rim and stayed there. I wrapped the pan with damp strips of old dish towels like I had been taught. You can also buy straps to wrap around your pan. The cake was moist and delicate. I loved it. I would think this recipe was intended for TWO loaf pans, there was a lot of batter. I think it would also bake well in a 9X13 pan.

I've been a cook and baker for 30 yrs. I was very disappointed in this recipe. I followed the directions exactly, including using the bottom rack of the oven. The bottom and sides burned and the middle was still raw. I can't imagine what happened. Perhaps the oven temp should be 325 and the cooking time longer.

Didn't believe the reviews, so tried it, but something's not right here. Mine spilled over too -- surely this is too big a recipe for this size pan?

I baked it at 325 and put in less cinnamon. The cake fell in the middle. In addition it was very dry- in short, it neither looked nor tasted good. Do not make it.

After reading the mixed reviews of this cake, I was hesitant to make it, but I followed the suggestions and lowered the heat which helped. My only suggest is that it should be baked for 45 minutes instead of 55. Remember that chocolate always appears less done than it really is.

Easy recipe. Definitely worth making, especially for chocolate lovers. The flavors blend well together combining the taste of Honey Cake that Jews are familiar with for Rosh Hashanah with a chocohalics love for desserts that include chocolate! Would make again.

This was my first disappointment from this site. I followed the recipe exactly. I decreased the amount of cinnamon as suggested. I reduced the heat to 325 as suggested. The darned thing bubbled up and all over my oven. The stench of charring chocolate filled my house. When it appeared to be done, the center fell, leaving two high ends and the depressed center, which was slightly gooey. My husband and I started calling it "saddlerock" cake because it looked like a saddle and the ends were hard as rocks. Fortunately we were able to buy a honey cake for Rosh Hashana.

Although I took it out of the oven before the middle was set, it ended up dry. Also, it calls for too much cinnamon.

Wonderful! Would just reduce the baking time a little bit. Made it again and this time baked it at 325F and it was incredible! Much better- should definately reduce the temperature

This is very very good. I had a very hard time getting it to firm up in the middle, which was frustrating. It's very sweet and rich. I might cut back on the cinnamon the next time.
