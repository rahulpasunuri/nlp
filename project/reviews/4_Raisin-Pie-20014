This is a great recipe for raisin pie lovers! The citrus rinds added a good depth of flavor without overpowering. Do not pack the fruit rinds into the measuring spoon like brown sugar, or else there will be too much citrus flavor.

Had been craving raisin pie so gave this one a go. It was soooo good!!! I mixed in some dried cherries with the raisins too (just a few). Yum. Takes me back to the pie my mom used to make. : )

Hoping to recapture the raisin pie of my youth (Grandmother's), I am close with this one. Listening only to the oohs and ahhs of Thanksgiving guests rather than the palate of memory, the rating here would be four stars, for this pie excites when served fresh and warm, but services all hedonistic needs when served a day later.
