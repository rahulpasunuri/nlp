Okay, this is one of those reviews that changed things up- for the better I believe. Used half milk and half H2O to add creaminess. Total of 5 cups liquid to assure it stayed creamy. Discovered that one does not NECESSARILY have to keep stirring the whole time! I had to turn it off after only 5 minutes of cooking due to schedule change. Polenta continued to gently thicken up but did not clump at all. When I was ready (40 minutes later!) I just brought it back up to heat and finished as directed. Perfect! Who knew? Best soft polenta I ever ate! Got raves.

the gorgonzola in the polenta is exceptional. you can easily double up the mushroom portion.

I rated this recipe a '4' because it is not only wonderful as written, but it is fundamentally strong enough to allow adaptation to fit special circumstances. The polenta can be emboldened simply by the use of broth instead of water. The use of other mushrooms can compliment different main dishes. The use of other cheeses can help to marry the polenta to its peers of plate. This is a recipe worth holding in the 'frequently used' part of the recipe box -- the sort of recipe that inspires both confidence and creativity in the cook.

Absolutely fantastic recipe. I did the instant polenta with portobello mushrooms and a good helping of gorgonzola, and my partner thought he'd died and gone to heaven (and this from a man who claimed not to like polenta). Very easy dish that looks like it requires more effort than it actually does. My only suggestion would be that if you are finding the polenta a bit bland, add more salt, it does wonders for polenta.

I am biased I LOVE polenta. I found a large (over a pound) bag at a local Pavilion (Vons, Safeway)for the ridiculous price of $1.50. This is not instant polenta, but I cooked it at a very low simmer and turned the fire off to let it steam. I used dried porcinis and fresh crimins and only made half the recipe. I only had pecorino romano and grated parmasean - still delish. This is comfort food.

I haven't yet tried this recipe, but I want to speak on behalf of the Italian-raised lady (see review about seven items down). Polenta doesn't refer to corn, but to crushed grain, or even other substances similarly used. I'm guessing that the -lent- in polenta is from the Latin "lentus", meaning slow, and refers to the method of cooking. The lady may be confusing polenta with arborio rice (both cooked slowy), but it's also possible that some Italians use the term "polenta rice" to mean arborio rice. In any case, it sounds as though she made risotto using this recipe and loved it, so we might want to consider giving that a try too!

Porcinis are a bit pricey for my wallet, I substituted portabellas and buttons, and they worked well. Love gorgonzola, so I loved this dish, even though I hated polenta as a kid (thank God for maturity). Also, the "cook" who was "raised Italian" could at least learn to misspell mozzarella consistently or their poor Gram will be flipping in her grave. But, if you live in wine country, some exceptions must be given. Mangia, beva.

Okay, so I cheated and used instant polenta (it was actually all I found at the store here), but it was delicious and incredibly rich. It would be good with the addition of any fresh herbs.

I found this recipe very easy to make. I did add some of my own ingredients to give it some "snap": fresh basil from the garden and believe it or not, a little nutmeg, and half a cup of cream. I prefer to cook the polenta on a lower heat, and a little slower. Good luck!!! This will definitely become a family staple.

You keep referencing Marcella's "no-stirring" method, but you don't elaborate. In a nutshell: 1) boil water, add salt, and add the polenta in a thin stream, whisking constantly and maintaining a boil; 2)when all cornmeal has been added, stir with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes; 3)Cover pot, keep at lively simmer, and remove cover and stir every 10 minutes for 1 minute until 40 minutes have elapsed. Give it another 5 minutes to loose grainyness, remove from heat and stir for 1 minute. Proceed with recipe.

Very easy vegetarian meal. Needs a "strong" cheese to give it the zip. I used some Talegggio along with the gorgonzola. Would be a wonderful side dish with grilled chicken or veal.

I think the other reviewer is confusing polenta and risotto. Polenta is made using corn meal, and risotto is made using rice...

I was raised Italian. Food is sacred to me. And to make this meal properly, with the "real" polenta rice, is to send this dish to heaven. I made the plolenta as it is shown but skipped the instant stuff. Family time is polenta time. Like my loving Gram said, God rest her soul. In the old way, slow cooking the special Italian rice found in Italian Mom and Pop stores across our great country was the norm. Back then,folks would saute handfulls of the Italian rice (ask the store owner for the polenta rice)and cook it SLOWLY with a splash dry white wine (optional)and olive oil, 3 ot 4 cloves smashed garlic and tablespoon of fresh saffron stems. The reason for doing this is you want to make your polenta so it cooks from the inside out. If you have ever had it and is has a chewey consistentcy, that is because the polenta was cooked too fast and raw in the center of the kernel. Once the polenta is aromatic and fluffed up, enjoy with this recipes and a glass of good Sonoma wine and some fresh sour dough bread. And, as a special bonus, the next day, you can pat your polenta into "pancakes" ,stuff the two pancakes with motzarelli cheese and mushroooms and shallots, roll the "pool balls" sized meatballs you have formed using your hands and deep fry them in olive oil. To die for and in more ways then one but you will love this second hidden bonus of making authentic polenta. It was my favorite of Grams many wonderful meals; "telephone wires" We used to call them that because when you break open the "polenta" balls the motsarella cheese would ooze out and make the "strings" and we would be a jazzed about that for some reason. Gram had a way of making the ordinary sing. And, she would want you to enjoy polenta in the true Italian manner and eat the aromatic alternative with this recipe. Love life that way. Ciao!
