Delicious with fennel, must try the other herb and cheese variations.

I just have to say sweet cicely and chervil are not the same and I have them both in my garden...

Hello...cicely AND chervil? They're the same thing! Not necessary, you can substitute flat leaf parsley and a little more fennel, since they're related anyway. Otherwise, nice recipe.

This was ok -- I used lemon olive oil to make the goat cheese sauce and it was nice. It was better cold the second day -- I used it as a sandwich spread with ham.

I didn't have all the ingredients to follow this recipe exactly, but it served as a good basis. I whisked herbed goat cheese with the oil it was cured in and whole cow's milk. Then I mixed in salt, chopped fresh chives and dried dill. Very yummy on top of the asparagus I microwaved in a bit of water. Good the next day on another batch of warm asparagus.
