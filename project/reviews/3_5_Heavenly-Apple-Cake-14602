This cake is a great way to use an abundance of apples. I halved the recipe and made in a loaf pan according to layering directions (it cooked for about 75 minutes). Because I was not making the cake for a kosher meal, I replaced the oil with 3/4 stick of melted butter. Perfect for snacks and breakfast. Would also be nice with ice cream for dessert, but doesn't beat apple crisp. I will definitely make again.

I made this cake for Rosh Hashanah last night and it was so good, I have eaten about two-thirds of myself! (No, I am not normally such a glutton.) I used a 10" springform pan which I believe caused it to bake a little faster than if a 9" had been used. I baked it about an hour rather than 75 minutes. It is important to do the toothpick test before taking a cake out of the oven.

Just made this cake for Rosh Hashanah. It was an epic failure. I used a tube pan, per another reader's suggestion, and baked the cake for the prescribed time. I let the cake cool and turned it out onto a wire rack. The edges were fully baked, but the inside was raw! The baking time for this recipe is completely off.

I make a very similar cake using a tube pan. The tube pan ensures the center of the cake gets done. I always toss the apples with 4-5 T of sugar and 2-3 tsp of cinnamon along with the lemon. I layer starting with 1/2 batter,1/2 apples,batter apples; adding any juices from apple mixture to top appples.

This was a moist flavorful cake. I used a bundt pan, honey crisp apples and tossed the apples with 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. allspice. Everyone at work loved it. I also used 1 c. cake flour in place of all purpose flour for a better texture.

My co-workers raved and raved about this cake (though oddly I thought it was just ok). Baking took a long time and required tin foil for the top. But all in all, this recipe is a keeper.

I live at 7300 feet and it is hard to get cakes done in the middle. I successfully used a 13 inch round metal pan and cooked for 1 hr at 325 convection.I put apples in middle and on top.It was perfectly done all the way through.

I'd add more apples and put more cinnamon and sugar on the apples and in the cake batter itself. If you make it in a bunt pan it looks a bit incomplete. I may look for a glaze to put on it for next time-- it would make it look better and might add some more moisture. Otherwise, a fun dessert that looks pretty.

Just made this following original recipe exactly, including using 9-inch springform. I have an accurate oven but I kept it going for an hour-and-a-half when I found the centre and bottom remained uncooked while the top began to burn (I used a Frieling glass-bottomed springform). I had popped on some foil after 50min, but it still burnt on top. The cake didn't overflow the pan. The tube or angel food pan is indeed a must to bring heat to the centre of the cake and cook the batter. Would give it another try with different pan next time. Flavour was good with the addition of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.

I have been making this cake for years (it is in the NY Times Jewish Cookbook) but you must use a tube- type pan or the center will not cook. I use a removable bottom angel food pan with straight sides. I also chop the apples into about half inch chunks and do the cake in three layers, alternating apples and batter and ending with batter. I have also used prune plums, which work just as well. Note, the batter is STICKY, but don't worry about it. One final suggestion: Try using a quality olive oil instead of a neutral oil. It adds an interesting note.

My family has been making this cake for 35+ yrs but in a more casual version (all apples are folded into the batter and its baked in a bundt pan) and under the name of Jewish Apple Cake. It always gets rave reviews...even requests by people for it to be made for them.

A friend at work made this and brought it in. It was gone after an hour!! So I made it using her modifications. I used brown sugar instead of white and soaked the apples in rum, maybe 2 TBSP. Then after about 15 min I drained the rum into the orange juice to make the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe. I also added 1 TBSP cinnamon to the four mixture. This is a very apple-y cake which I like. I baked it in a bundt pan and found it was done after 1 hr

I followed many of the suggestions from others. I used a bundt pan, used Gala apples, added cinnamon & nutmeg to dry mix, as well as to apple mixture. I also added orange to dry. To wet, I added lemon extract since I didn't have orange ( I think orange would have been a little better). I put apples on bottom (top after you bake & flip) of bundt pan, then batter, apples, batter, and apples again. The majority of my family liked it. My husband thought it was fair. My son picked out the apples- hey, they were coated with sugar and cinnamon, what 2 year old wouldn't like that? I would make again. Maybe trying a different apple and getting the orange extract. The bundt cake looked really good. It was a moist cake also which I feared that it may be dry but not in the least bit.

Rating: 3
As per previous reviewers advice, I baked in a bundt pan. It was done in just under an hour. I also increased the cinnamon slightly. Overall, a moist and delicious cake that I was craving the next day! It improved with age, best on days 2 and 3. I will definitely make it again, to serve at breakfast or brunch, as it is more in the style of an eat-out-of-your-hand breakfast cake, not a dessert cake.

I am an avid baker and recipe editor and couldn't believe how long this cake took to cook. I wish I would have read all the reviews beforehand, I might have chosen another pan. I didn't have any spillage over the 9 1/2 inch springform pan, but it didn't come out as pretty as I thought it would have (wish there was a picture of the finished dish). This recipe really needs to be updated and corrected.

I always find cakes made without butter or milk to be heavy, flavorless, or just plain gross. But this cake was delicious - light, fluffy, and tasted like an apple harvest. All my guests loved it and no one even suspected that it was pareve. I used only about 3/4 of the sugar the recipe suggested and went easy on the cinnamon, but it was still by no means bland. I also made it in a giant pan based on the recommendations below and I was glad I did because it expanded to fill the entire roasting pan! I had enough cake to feed an army, but it froze and reheated very well too. All in all, a huge hit!

Easy and delicious! Having read the comments here I did the following: used a bundt pan; used golden delicious apples, cut into smaller pieces and layered throughout the cake; used more spices in the apples, but left the batter as in the recipe; used much less sugar than called for in the apples since I wasn't arranging them on top of the cake; baked for amount of time called for in the recipe. It came out moist and not at all bland to my taste - perhaps some of the reviewers were expecting a different kind of cake altogether.

This was the first apple cake I've ever made and it came out fabulous! I used fiji apples. I followed some of the suggestions written here to make it a little more exciting. Specifically, I added significantly more cinnamon. I made a cinnamon and sugar mixure and coated the apples with it, after I added the lemon juice. I also added a tiny bit of ground ginger and nutmeg to the dry mix. I used a 9.75 inch pan (it didn't run over). I baked it for probably about 1/2 hour longer (I didn't pay that close attention, though). It was moist and delicious and a big hit!

This came out wonderfully! I made it in a 10" bundt pan. I did add a bit of nutmeg and cloves to the apples and used apple juice instead of orange juice. I will definitely make this again.

A very tasty cake. My husband the no dessert guy loved it. If it wasn't the Jewish holidays we would have scooped some vanilla ice cream on it, and it would have been perfect, but it was very nice on its own. I added extra spices to the apples but not to the batter because I like a vanilla flavored cake. I added extra vanilla to the batter. Also added walnuts. Next time I would chunk the apples for the middle layer so as to more evenly distribute the apples in the cake, but I definitely liked arranging the top, it looked very pretty. I baked it for a loooong time in a 9 1/2" spring form pan. I kind of lost track because i kept on cooking it in additional 5 to 10 minute intervals, it was for at least a half an hour more than what the recipe called for and even then it was a little raw in the center. The rest of the cake cooked up fine and in spite of the extended baking, did not burn. My oven is pretty accurate.

This is a great breakfast cake. I found this recipe while browsing for something tasty to use some Rome apples in. It sounded simple, but I was wondering what the timing would turn out like since everyone seemed to have issue with that. I was out of O.J. so used milk instead as one reviewer said they did and I didn't have a springform so used a 9x13. I got a little concerned when 1/2 the batter only barely covered the bottom of the pan. I was surprised at all the apples I had (used 3 big Romes and 2 smaller), but just placed them all alongside eachother anyway, sometimes snapping the pieces in 1/2 to fill small voids. After dusting with the cin-sugar, I seriously started to think I was going to have a problem when the second half of the batter didn't even cover some places. But the rest of the apples got stacked in, and dusted with the cin-sugar and the whole experiment was popped into a 350 oven. 1/2 hour later I could smell it, and was surprised to see it doming! No wonder everyone's smaller pans overflowed - this is the expanding cake for certain! I'd set the timer for 80 min as the recipe suggested even though everyone else said longer, but was thinking it smelled to strongly to not be near ready at 40 min. I cooked for 65 just to be sure, but given the pan I used - it was slightly overcooked. The sides were darker, but the top looked good. I really wouldn't go over 60 min if I used the same pan again(or even a tube/bundt pan). Maybe because of overflow problems, 2 pans would be good if using a 9". Other than using milk (and I'd try apple juice next time if out of O.J.) there were no changes to the rest of the ingredient list. It was simple, and good the next morning warmed with coffee.

Here is how to make this recipe delicious: 1) Use the best tasting eating apples such as Honey-crisp, Gala, Braeburn, Granny etc. Do not use a bland, mushy apple like Rome, Red Delicious or Mackintosh etc. 2) Add extra flavor wherever you can! Mix the apples with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, maybe even a little grand marinier 3) Add the same spices to the dry mix. To the wet ingredients I added some orange extract, but you could add lemon extract too. 4) Use a bundt or tube pan. I got good results with a tube pan lined with parchment paper. I sprayed the pan with PAM and added flour for good measure. 5. Add some nuts to the topping for crunch (optional). Finally, add as many apples as you want to add! The pan will seem full of apples, but it's ok because they shrink down after cooking. Don't worry about the design; the batter will expand around the apples and it doesn't matter much. The most important thing is adding flavor before baking the cake. With these additions the cake is lovely and very appropriate for any Jewish holiday except for passover!

This was terrible. I added more vanilla to the recipe and even added some butter to give it a better flavor. I added more cinnamon too and it was still bland and I didn't like the texture. I made for a friend but didn't give to him because it just wasn't good enough!

I made this cake for a family picnic and it received raves, but I am less convinced. It looked beautiful, but I think it needs more spices - I added way more cinnamon that the recipe calls for, and also some nutmeg, and it was still rather bland. Still, a good basic apple cake recipe, very comforting with a cup of tea in the morning!

My husband went nuts over this cake, repeated over and over how great he thought it was. I also thought it tasted wonderful - perhaps a bit sweet for my taste, but great texture. I used a 10.5 inch springform and it took me about half an hour longer than the recipe specified, although my oven usually bakes much faster than suggested. My only problem was that it seemed to me to be a lot of ingredients for a small cake.

Rating: 4
As other reviewers have stated, this cake took 3/4 of an hour longer than specified in the recipe. I also added more vanilla extract and more cinnamon. I tossed the apples with cognac, which gave them a delicious flavor. I served this at our family Rosh Hashanah dinner at which one of my nieces exclaimed, "This is the best cake I've ever eaten."

Rating: 3
Tasted good, but it completely fell apart. I used a springform pan and the batter went over the sides. It didn't cook all the way through in the middle and it didn't look pretty to serve, but people didn't seem to mind. I used half oil and half oil replacement made from apples.

Rating: 2
I made this cake in a 10" tube pan. It came out pretty and moist, however, because the apples were cut in eighths they didn't come out soft enough. The cake needed twice as many apples and more spicing. Most standard Jewish recipe books have oil based apple cakes that are better than this.

Rating: 3
Heavenly! Not only does it taste good, but its presentation is beautiful. I did change a few things due to other reviews that I read before making this cake. I used Yellow Delicious Apples (4); instead of 1 cup vegetable oil, I used 1 cup applesauce; I used 2 Tablespoons vanilla extract; baked it approximately 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours; used a 10" springform pan and had no runover. I highly recommend this recipe!

this is my sisters favorite cake that i bake, i just have a tip: it looks beautiful in a 9" springform pan, mine nevers drips over but needs extra time to cook. to ensure that the top apples dont blacken while the middle does not cook, make a "tent" out of tinfoil and place over the cake when it is almost done. it helps alot..

I baked it in a deep aluminum foil pan, the disposable kind, which seemed to have helped keep it from burning, and no problems with spillage this way. Took 2 hours to bake. Tasted fine to me, my parents liked that it was not too sweet, and it was moist. More like a breakfast cake.

I make this recipe pretty regularly, however I have adapted the recipe. I use a bundt pan and know that it's done when I can smell it (less than an hour). I add about 2-3 tbs of vanilla extract and about 4 tbs of cinnamon. I also add cinnamon to the base batter as well as the battered apple layer. These changes really make the cake wonderful.

This cake is always requested by my family for the holidays. I use an angel food cake pan which takes 1 1/4 hour at 350. I use 4 small apples and add extra cinnamon sugar to the middle. I also decorate the top with some of the apples and sprinkle it with a little more cinnamon sugar which gives it a crisp, sweet finish.

I have made this recipe many times and have had the best success when I use a 10" tube pan. The baking time is 60-65 minutes and there is no need for aluminum foil as it does not bake over! I didn't have orange juice today, so I used apple juice and also added 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter. This version was the best ever!

This cake was a big disappointment. Very bland, and I had the same problems with baking time as everyone else. After 1 hr. 35 minutes it was still uncooked in the very center even though the top was starting to overbrown. I just cut out the center and served the rest, but it was very unsatisfying.

This tasted good but the texture was not as fine as I expected to be (since it is called Heavenly). Nevertheless delicious.

This is a crowd-pleasing cake, and I usually serve it for breakfast. The quantity of apples is too large; I reduce the apples to three Granny Smith apples. The only problem I have with the cake is baking it long enough (baking time is more than 1 1/4 hrs.) while not burning the bottom of it. Last time, I used a piece of parchment on the bottom and this helped a little bit.

I have just turned off my oven and left the cake until morning. It's midnight and the cake has been in the oven for two hours and is uncooked in the middle and burned on the edges. I don't know what I did wrong. Maybe the springform pan should be more than 9 inches because mine spilled over and other reviews didn't. Oh well, I will keep looking for a good recipe.

Truly truly heavenly. Best apple cake I've ever made. I used yellow delicious apples and cake came out sweet. Next time I would use larger pan and bake it for at least ½ hour longer. The use of foil is definitely good idea. In addition, I will use a little cognac or calvados over apples next time. Great cake, thanx.

We really liked this cake. It isn't too sweet, but with 2 cups of sugar it is certainly sweet enough. I used a 9 1/2" springform pan and it completely filled the pan. I also had to bake it almost two hours. Served with vanilla ice cream it is a good use of Autumn's bounty of apples.

Though the cake looked beautiful (I baked it in a 10" springform pan, it had good height, it baked perfectly in the alloted time, and it neither overflowed nor leaked out), I would not make it again--not sweet enough, not flavorful enough even with nutmeg and cardamom and ginger in the batter, and really not all that moist (I even added an extra egg since mine were medium, not large). I served it with a hefty spreading of honeyed-nonfat yogurt and a dollop of homemade orange-caramel sauce, and the sauces were all that saved this cake from being a disaster. Still, I was ashamed to have made such a bland, dry cake, and won't be trying it again.

I followed all the suggestions (tad more sugar, more cinnamon, more vanilla) and actually baked it in a 12 inch spring form, it was done in a little over an hour and it was great. The top puffed up beautifully. We had it for dessert but I think it would be even better for a brunch.

Just finished baking the cake. I have not tried it yet. It looks nice and I am sure it will taste good. However in my opion if the cake were baked in a 10 inch pan I don't think it would run over and I'm sure you would not have to bake it longer. If it is as good as everyone says it is and I do try it again that is what I am going to try.

This cake is fabulous. Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. Baked for a luncheon and it was loved by all, adults and kids alike. I added a bit more cinnamon, sugar (not much) and sprinkled some chopped walnuts in the first apple layer. Cake did take longer to bake than the recipe called for (add 15 min) and did leak a little so use the foil.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed making this cake with my children. Be sure to arrange the apples away from the edges of the pan so that when the pan is removed the integrity of the cake is not compromised. I added extra cinnamon, added a good splash of vanilla with great results. It seems to need more time to bake than the recipe calls for but the results are worth the wait!! This cake is best when it sits a couple days ahead...which is great for anyone preparing for a party. I highly recommend this recipe with thick cut golden delicious apples.

Rating: 2
I thought that the cake lacked character. The cake had a "flat" taste and was not very sweet. I think it would benefit from more spice, more sugar, and more salt. I would substitute cake flour next time and cut the apples into smaller pieces Although I have a very accurate oven and baked it in a 9 1/2 inch pan, it took an extra 30 minutes to bake this cake. It did run over a bit, so the foil is a good idea. This cake benefited from sitting for a day, and would be ideal to make ahead of time for a busy person. I think the recipe could be improved

One of the best cakes I've ever made. Really easy, too. I've used really juicy apples every time I've made it, and this has helped to keep the top from burning. It might be nice to splash some rum or brandy on the apples along with the lemon juice.
