I quit making Jambalaya awhile back as the liquid always absorbed into the rice and was dry in my opinion. I was looking for a recipe that I could take to work for Mardi Gras and ran across this one and decided to try it because I could bake it in the oven. I made the base the night before then I browned the chicken in the morning and packed it in a seperate container. I placed the sauce, chicken and the rice in a microwavable container for 8 mins. then placed in the oven for 55 mins. We have a small countertop oven so it took a little longer. Oh my gosh. To die for. It still had moisture even though the rice was cooked through. I used Uncle Ben's rice. I didn't use the ham, but followed the rest of the recipe as written. Crusty bread and fresh butter. Yum.

Very good. Love the fact that it is in one pot. Just keep adding, no transferring from one to another. I used andouille, chicken thighs and shrimp. Only put in 1 1/2 cups rice. Delish!

Made this for my husband's birthday dinner and it was fantastic!! I cut the recipe in half - for meat I only used 1 lb of andoille, 6 chicken thighs and half a pound of shrimp, used all red pepper, brown rice instead of white and left out scallions. Family LOVED it - there was nothing left! It was super easy to make too....will definitely do it again! Threw the shrimp in for the last 7 minutes and they were perfect...next time will add more shrimp and sausage.

Perfect jambalaya. I left out the linguica (because wow that's a lot of meat) but used andouille and all the other proteins. I also added an extra can of chopped green chiles, and a fresh jalapeno to boot. Definitely make it your own, heat wise. My boyfriend has already requested that I make this again, and I will.

I was looking for a simple one pot weeknight meal and I got a restaurant worthy dinner! Jambalaya to me has always been a little ho-hum, but this recipe is not! I did make some changes, based on what I had on hand and what I could get my hands on. First of all, the amount of meat in this recipe is excessive, IMO. Almost 4 pounds of pork products and 6 chicken thighs equates to almost ½ pound of meat per person if this is supposed to feed 10. I just couldnt bring myself to add that much meet. I didnt use the bacon, because I had guanciale fat in freezerjust cooked the veggies in that fat to give it that wonderful richness and flavor. (Im obsessed with guanciale (pork jowls) right now, new discovery that I love oh so much!) Im sure the bacon would be great. I sautéed all of the veggies (used 2 red peppers instead of one green) in the fat in a large Dutch oven. I added the cut chicken as directions instructed and partially cooked. Then, I cooked the sausages and ham until browned, but not cooked through. I used 4 of the 6 fresh Johnsonville brats I had on hand and ½ pound of cubed Black Forest ham. I threw all of that in the pot with the veggies and added the rest of the ingredients. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used a quart of roasted tomato, garlic, and onion sauce I had just put up in the freezer and a few jalapeno and banana peppers from the garden. The recipe is missing garlic, so my sauce with its roasted garlic added another layer of flavor. I would definitely add lots of chopped garlic to the recipe. I cooked the dish as instructed, but turned off the oven at the end of the cooking time and left it, covered, in the oven for at least an hour before we ate. Everyone raved about it and I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for a potluck with a New Orleans theme. I liked this so much I made it again a week latter. The only substitution I made was using goose fat (left over from Christmas dinner) in place of the bacon. EVERYTHING goes better with goose fat. LOL.

The great thing about this recipe is that not only it tasted great, but I saved some of the Jambalaya before I mixed it with the rice for left overs and another night I mixed up with pasta and another day with eggs for breakfast, it was a delicious in all the other dishes!

Rating: 4
Fantastic. Very easy dish. We made this to recipe with the exception of using smoked paprika in place of the regular paprika. It helped continue the theme from the bacon, andouille, and smoked ham. The spice/heat is perfect. It has a little kick, but doesn't overwhelm the dish. Putting the scallions in at the end is genius. They retain their freshness, crispness and look and taste terrific. My husband doesn't do as well with spicy, so he mixed in a few dollops of creme fraiche to cut the heat. This dish is the definition of comfort food.

I added garlic and used only yellow bell peppers, but otherwise made as is. Very, very good...full of different flavors that melded well together.

Just having read the recipe, and not making this, this seems like a very tasty recipe. I have to partially disagree with another reviewer who says that jambalaya is traditionally made with a roux. In fact, SOME jambalaya is made with a roux. This is a recipe for Creole, or red jambalaya. Usually, we use tomato paste, not canned tomatoes with peppers, although I don't have any objection to that. Cajun, or brown, jambalaya is made with a roux and is typically moister. There's a very good discussion of this on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambalaya One thing I have to say is this has a much higher proportion of meat to rice that what is typically made in New Orleans.

Although Jambalaya is traditionally made with a roux, this is the best, most flavorful Jambalaya recipe I have tried. I use use bacon, Andouille, Chorizo, Hickory Smoked Ham, Chicken and add shrimp right before serving. Delish!

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half for a smaller group, and we were fighting over the leftovers. One word of caution: I realized that my sausages were pretty spicy and omitted the cayenne altogether. If it had been any spicier, some of my guests couldn't have eaten it. Definitely taste and see where you're at before you add in any additional spice when you reach that part of the recipe! Other than that I made the recipe as written, using Thai red rice which took about 30 minutes longer to cook. I made the meat/veggie mixture in the morning, then added rice and baked in the evening, and it was perfect!

I made this today so that we'd have it for Christmas day (we do not celebrate Christmas and were planning an outdoor day - so we'll come home to this). First, the substitutions: - turkey bacon (lower fat) - turkey sausages - hot Italian and sweet Italian - instead of linguica and andouille - brown rice instead of white - no ham The brown rice does require more cooking than white, so after 45 mins, the rice was not done. I didn't have a pot big enough so had to divide it up (before adding the broth and rice) into two pots. Three of us just did a "taste test" and it really is quite delicious. I was surprised there's no okra in it, and others mentioned shrimp but half my family don't eat shrimp, so I couldn't add that. We'll see if this is indeed enough for my family of 5 (the recipe says serves 10) as I have two sons who are very hearty eaters.

A very good and very forgiving recipe. I didn't have ham so I used some smoked chipotle powder instead of the chili powder and cayenne. to cut down on the fat I also used shredded chicken breast instead of thighs, elminated the 1.5 pounds of sausage (kept the andouille) and used only 3 pieces of bacon. I added 3/4 tsp celery salt, garlic powder and black pepper to pick up the taste a little since I eliminated so much fat. I cut the rice in half per previous suggestions. It was absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it!

This was my first attempt at Jambalaya. I had some difficulty finding the sausages in our local market. After finding all the ingredients The recipe was easy to follow. The rice cooked in the oven at exactly 40min. I would warn to watch the pot in the oven. The end product was delicious spicy and smokey. It served 8 hungry guys easly.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! My foodie friends loved it. We did omit 1 cup of rice using only two and even that may have been too much. Also used Smoked Paprika, which added a lot of flavor. Will definitely use garlic next time as well as add shrimp for a different twist. It's easy and has great flavor.

Rating: 3
I stayed pretty close to the recipe. I cut the bacon because I was out and used only one sausage because it sounded like too much to me. I was happy with the flavor but I agree with others - it's too much rice. Cut it back by a cup. It ended up being a rice dish. I also added shrimp at the end cuz for me "it ain't Jumbalaya if it don't got shrimp!" Also try the Spicy Gumbo-laya recipe on this site. It's very good.

I've rated hundreds of recipes since I discovered Epicurious back in the 90's, and I've only thought a small handful were worthy of a four-fork rating. This is one of them. I made it because I happened to have andouille sausages in the refrigerator that I didn't want to go to waste, so it was just one of those serendipitous things. There are only two of us, so I divided the recipe by four, and it worked out just fine, with ample leftovers. Of course, I made a few changes, based on what ingredients were handy and fresh. I used smoked paprika, as I had a new jar of that and the regular paprika has been sitting around too long. I used brown rice, which is much better for my husband's blood sugar, and I found it worked out just fine, even though all I had was long grain. I had to add extra beef broth and cook it about 20 more minutes, but it was toothsome and bursting with infused flavors. I didn't have linguica, but I substituted shrimp, added during the last five minutes of cooking. What was most fabulous about this was that the seasonings were absolutely perfect. Somehow I doubt that the leftovers are going to survive a midnight raid...

Great, flexible recipe. I used my 7 1/4 quart le creuset dutch oven and everything fit nicely with room to stir - I did back off on the rice to 2 1/2 cups based on prior reviews. Other tweaks: I used about half the amount of bacon, omitted the andouille and used only 1 package of linguica (12 oz). Still seemed like plenty of meat. Added 3 cloves garlic, subbed chicken broth for the beef broth. I added a pound of shrimp at the end - based on a different jambalaya recipe, after the rice was tender, I removed the pot from the oven, stirred in the raw shrimp (lightly salted and peppered), put the lid on and let it sit on the stove (off heat) until we were ready to eat (probably was 20- 30 min or so). I was skeptical the first time I tried it but the shrimp came out perfectly cooked. I used only 1 can of Rotel and 1 15 oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes (kept it less spicy for those who don't tolerate heat). Served with cornbread and coleslaw for a relatively easy dinner... everyone seemed to enjoy it. Easily served 10 people including 5 men with big appetites.

This has fantastic flavor, but I think they are calling for way too much rice because the end result was not the right consistency for jambalaya it was a bit too dry. So next time I will try it with less.

Rating: 4
I love how baking the jambalaya deepen the flavors! I only used chicken andouille, ham, (less)bacon and chicken since I couldn't find linguica. Still, plenty of meat and flavor. I used all red peppers because I don't like green. I used more cayenne than the recipe calls for and I probably could have used more. Only issue I had was the long grain brown rice I added did not cook well despite adding an extra 20 minutes (I definitely did not use all of the rice the recipe calls for). Still, the taste is fantastic.

This recipe is very flexible and I actually just used linguica, chicken and I used 1 lb. shrimp...instead of more meat...I did use the bacon...I added a bit more cayenne wanted it to have a good kick...the flavors were wonderful and it was easy to make. I also sauteed about 3 cloves of garlic with the onions. I added the shrimp the last 20 minutes of cooking so they didn't dry out...I also like another reviewer mentioned backed off and just used 2 cups of rice due to only cooking for my family. This makes alot!! I usually make the recipe as stated but after reading some suggestions, decided that shrimp would be a nice substitution for the ham. I will definitely make again for a large group, perfect for a football game or something that you need to make a larger quantity.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I added 3 large cloves of garlic. Substituted chicken sausage for the 1 1/2 pounds of smoked sausage, diced 2 28-ounce cans of tomatoes and used half of the liquid (who carries diced tomatoes with green chilies?) 2 4-ounce cans of diced green chilies, smoked paprika and 2 1/2 cups of rice. Glad I bumped up the tomatoes/liquid otherwise would have been dry. As long as you maintain the Trinity, andouille and bacon you have a great foundation for creativity...next time will definitely add shrimp. This is a keeper!

Rating: 4
I agree with another reviewer: don't add salt. The dish is balanced, most likely due to the sodium from the bacon and sausages. However, as every palate is different, feel free to add salt, Tabasco sauce, or whatever to your own plate/bowl. I especially like the last-minute touch of the green onions and parsley for that extra fresh flavor. Finally, I found the end result just a tad dry, overall. On my next attempt, I wont' drain the canned tomatoes and will use their juices (this recipe didn't specify whether or not to drain the cans).

Rating: 4
I had every single meat product for this in my freezer, so I went for it. It was awesome. The only changes I made were that I cut back on the rice by a cup, and the tomatoes by one can, and still used a bit more broth mixed with some tomato paste to get the consistency I wanted. I also added a heaping tsp. of smoked paprika. Bottom line is that this is a versatile base recipe to make to add or delete to your taste. Try it!

Great Jambalaya, and easy to make. I halved the recipe for four people, added 3 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf, used smoked paprika instaed of chili powder as another reviewer suggested, eliminated the ham, subbed chicken broth for beef to lighten it a little and added 1/2 lb. shrimp 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven. Everyone loved it.

This was DELICIOUS! I had to make a few substitutions because of what I had on hand... I only used bacon, andouille sausage and chicken breast for the meats (added more chicken breast to compensate for lack of ham and other sausage), a can of plain diced tomatoes plus two jalapenos instead of the two canned together, and chicken broth instead of beef broth. Out of this world! Spicy, flavorful, and moist and just perfect. Delicious as leftovers, too!

This was really really delicious. I made a couple changes that I would definitely recommend. I used Spanish hot smoked paprika, which added a great spicy flavor to the whole dish. I also added almost twice as many canned tomatoes as the recipe calls for - it looked like a lot of liquid but in the end the rice soaked it up and it was perfect. I also added some large shrimp at the very end of cooking...highly recommended and takes a little away from the rich, saltiness of the dish. Highly recommended overall!

I disagree with the reviewer below who said it needed salt. I think the salt in the meats is quite enough to suffice. Different palates may feel otherwise, but I just wanted to throw that out there. We looooooved this. It's complex and savory and hearty and just plain delicious. Highly recommended.

This recipe has a few serious omissions. First of all, there's no salt and it's definitely not got enough salt from the smoked meats. Second, it should have garlic. There is no jambalaya without garlic. Third, it should have black and white pepper. Fourth, canned tomatoes with chilis? How hard is it to dice up a few and throw them in with the tomatoes? I used serrano, just because it was what I had. My wife is New Orleans Creole and I have had great jambalaya. I wish I had her family recipe, but it's gone now. This had too many different meats and not enough authentic flavor. Epicurious has a jambalaya recipe from Paul Prudhomme, I made that one a few years back and it's a whole lot better.

Rating: 4
I made this for Fat Tuesday to break in a new 8 quart Staub pot and it was barely big enough. I added one extra cup of broth and used only 2 cups of rice and the liquid was just enough. I did add ½ lb. of easy peel shrimp (just had to) and a little less andouille (ours is very hot). It turned out fabulous except next time I think Ill substitute Cajon seasoning for the chili powder.

Loved it! I cut the meat back maybe 20% and it was still plenty meaty. The time in oven might need to be cut 10/15 minutes in a good oven but other than that i seed no need to change a thing.....I will make again!

This was fantastic. Never made jambalaya before but my husband, the expert on Cajun cooking applauded this recipe. The only thing I added was a healthy amount of shrimp. I really like the fact that I was able to get the bulk of the ingredients at my local supermarket - didn't have to hunt down a bunch of exotic ingredients for a simple mid-week night dinner.

Rating: 4
This was delicious!! It was my first time making authentic Jambalaya, and it definitely won't be my last-- it was amazing! My one complain with the recipe is that they should list the celery in a measurement like they do everything else -- 2 stalks of celery was confusing to me because 2 individual ribs of celery did not seem like enough, but two whole bunches of celery seemed like way too much. Since I was pretty sure the "holy trinity" of new orlean's cooking is equal parts peppers, celery, and onions, I just increased the celery to an amount that looked about the same as the peppers; I used 6 individual ribs of celery, and after we tasted it, I thought that amount was perfect. The other change I made, based on previous reviews, was to decrease the rice to 2 1/2 Cups. This was perfect; I baked the dish for 45 mintues, and the rice was fully cooked and there was not too much liquid leftover. Perfect, and rave reviews by everyone! One last minor adjustment I made was to decrease the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp, and add a few shakes of red pepper flakes; this gave it the perfect spiciness level for our friends who are not super "spicy" people. We served cornbread with this, and it added a nice touch of sweetness to counter the spiciness. Cheddar cheese might also be a nice topping. I will definitely make this again, and not just on Mardi Gras! PS. I'm wondering, has anyone tried to freeze this dish? I'm curious if it would freeze well?

Rivals the best jambalaya we had in Nawlins. I used smoked Spanish paprika, omitted the bacon and subbed shrimp for the chicken thighs for our Fat Tuesday dinner. The smokiness from the paprika and the incredible flavor from the linguica made this dish exceptional. If it weren't for all the sausage, we could eat it every night. My only regret is that tomorrow is Ash Wednesday, so we need to wait until Thursday to eat the leftovers.

I followed the recipe to a "t" for a 20 person Mardi Gras party this weekend. It was a huge it. It was easy and so delicious. Definitely a solid choice for jambalaya. The only thing I would point out is that the recipe calls for a "large pot". I used my All Clad dutch oven and it was almost too small. However, in a traditional oven, any bigger would probably not fit.

Rating: 4
Really excellent. It IS very meaty, which for my purposes (a dinner party with some meat lovers) was good, although if I made it just for personal consumption I'd halve the meat and increase the vegetables, like the previous reviewer. If anything I found the mixture a little too wet the first day, but since I made it ahead and reheated it before the party, the rice went from being a tad mushy to being just right.

Rating: 3
Good hearty meal. Felt extremely meaty so I used half the suggested amount of all the meats. I also added 3 extra bell peppers to make it a little more rounded. The rice went dry about 30 minutes into cooking so I added 2 c water. Even with cutting down on the meat there was still plenty per serving. Next time I would likely add even more veggies, keep the meat the same, and maybe decrease to 2 or 2.5 c of rice.

Rating: 4
I've made jambalaya several times but this was the best recipe I've come across yet. It was a big hit with the family as well since it had just the right amount of heat. To reduce the fat content, I used a 10- oz pkg of bacon, hardwood smoked chicken sausage and chicken andouille, as well as a combo of reduced sodium chicken broth and beef broth. To bump up the smokiness, I used 1 tablespoon smoked paprika and 1 tablespoon regular paprika. I'd also note that at least for my family, we got closer to 15 extremely filling servings.

Really a great dish. I omitted the linguica, used chicken broth instead of beef broth and added 1/2 lb shrimp in the last 5 minutes. Followed all the other ingredients. It turned out awesome! Spicy! Certainly a keeper, and one of the best.

I have eaten Jambalaya many, many times over the years, but have never tried making it. I read this recipe in the March 2011 issue of Bon Appetit, and followed it with the exceptions of using Chorizo for the "fully cooked sausage" and omitting the shrimp. The result was, unquestionably, the best Jambalaya I have ever had. Because I was making it for two, I cut the entire recipe in half. The cooking time was perfect, resulting in rice that was fully cooked and moist. The blend of spices was perfect. Enjoy!

Also my first attempt at jambalaya. Scaled down by about half, used Cajun chicken sausage because I couldn't find andouille. Only used red bell pepper, added a clove of garlic,and used chicken stock instead. Cooked 25 minutes on the stove after adding the rice instead of in the oven. It rocked!

This was my first time making jambalaya and it was outstanding. Used what I could find,reg. smoked bacon, applewood ham,smoked sausage no celery (we don't care much for it) and red and yellow peppers. I tried to reduce amt. by 1/3 so I had to tweak the rice/broth ratio. It also needed about 15 extra minutes to cook properly. My family loved it!Even with the reduction, it made a ton.

Rating: 4
A nice smokey taste and just the right amount of heat when serving to guests. I would reduce the rice to 2 cups next time.
