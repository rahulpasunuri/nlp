Delicious! And could be made early in the day. My guests ate every drop and wanted more. I'll make this again.Recipe was spot on and it turned out perfectly. I also served in stemmed glasses, so pretty.

My teenage son, who loves to cook, made this tonight and it was amazing! He was complimented repeatedly as it was simply delicious. Great combo of flavours and textures. He presented it in a wine glass with some baby mint leaves on top which had gave off a great aroma as we devoured the strawberries. Couldn't find strawberry sorbet, so used a new Haagen Dazs flavor, Summer Berries and it worked out really well. Will definitely make this again.
