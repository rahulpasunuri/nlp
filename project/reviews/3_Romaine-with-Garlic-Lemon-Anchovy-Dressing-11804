A great dressing sorta-Caesar-kinda-thing. We love this one on grilled Romaine hearts. We just halve the hearts lengthwise and set on a hot grill for a few seconds to slightly wilt the surface and give a smoky counterpoin to the lemony dressing. Folks love 'em.

This was excellent! Not as much trouble as my usual caesar and very fresh tasting. could not stop munching. Use fresh lenom juice only. The person who threw it out, obviously did not like anchovies.added this to my recipe box.

I have been making something similar for a couple of years. I add a good 1-1/2 tsp of Dijon mustard (or to taste). The anchovies are not overpowering in taste, but the dressing is definately a personal choice..it may not appeal to all

Golly, this just wasn't for us. Taste is such an individual thing, but we threw it out before ever putting it on the lettuce.

Excellent salad dressing; people who say they don't like anchovies will love the dressing. (Don't let them in on the secret ingredient!) My kids are happily eating salad again.
