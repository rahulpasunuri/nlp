Any recipe that takes 5 minutes to prepare, less than 10 to cook and has my 10 month old screaming for more is 4 forks in my book. This was surprisingly flavorful for the few ingredients used. I used dried lemon peel and bottled lemon juice since I had no fresh ones and it still was very tasty and soooo juicy. I also added a couple of more garlic cloves since I love garlic. I seriously couldn't cut pieces for my child fast enough, I barely had time to eat my own! This was the perfect dish on a hot summer night when the last thing you want is to turn the oven on. I definitely will make this again.

Halibut is such a beautifully fleshy fish, and it's so easy to cook that it practically cooks itself! This recipe is simple, and it adds delicate fragrance and taste to the fish. There is only one way to mess it up: over-grilling.

I am trying to incorporate more fish into our diet and this one really fit the bill. Fast and easy...with wonderful taste. Perfect for family or casual dinning.

Started to make this and realized we'd used the last lemon, so I substituted lime. Minced the peel real fine, after peeling it ever so thinly and avoiding the pith. Since my old grill is somewhat unpredictable, after rubbing the oil, minced lime, salt & pepper all over the fish, I left it in foil for the first 10 minutes on the grill (turned it after 6 minutes). Took it out of the foil and grilled it on one of those griddle surfaces with the holes (fish too flaky for open grill) for last four minutes. Oh, and I poured the marinade from inside the foil over it then too. Wow! My wife loved it! Of course, she'll eat yard mulch as long as I do the cooking. ;-)

Quick, easy and excellent. Even my kids loved it, and they don't normally enjoy fish.

Very easy and delicous.

The fish seemed to steam, rather than grill. I suspect that it was too wet from soaking up the lemon juice. Perhaps the results would be better if the marinade had a bit of olive oil in it to begin with.

I thought this was bland despite using more lemon,pepper, and garlic than suggeted; marinated the fish for 35 minutes so as not to "precook" the fish since I used extra lemon juice. I agree it was a quick recipe but the results for us were not great. Thanks

This is an easy to make dish that prepares in minutes and is very tasty. It goes great with baby red potatoes and a little grilled asparagus. Definetly reccomend it for people trying to eat lighter.

I never knew Halibut could be so tasty and moist after grilling. There is a subtle mediterrainian flavor that needs no additional added condiments. This recipe is easy enough to prepare for 6-10 guests and will disappear in a flash. A summer delight.
