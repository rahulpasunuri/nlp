With one essential change this recipe was such a hit this Thanksgiving that there was not one potato stick leftover! The thought of steamed sweet potatoes did not appeal to me so, I roasted them in the oven with just a little olive oil spray until crisp and then tossed them in the olive oil mixture. The cilanto is definately a must, although, my husband had it without it and loved it! I plan to make this recipe part of our regular family meals!

I found this to be very bland made according to the recipe, but with some alterations it ended up being a hit at Thanksgiving. I more than tripled the amount of ginger and I added some brown sugar to taste. The ginger and brown sugar make a nice flavor combination.
