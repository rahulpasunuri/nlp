This was surprisingly tasty, but I found the directions hard to follow. So, we seared the meat on the grill and then let it roast over indirect heat. I also am not sure if my noodles had the proper texture. This recipe was a lot of work - but it was so good I'm sure we will have it again.

This recipe appears time intensive, but it really is not. The slicing of the pork, laying it out the next day for the baking process are the worst of the time. I have made this several times for family and friends, always to rave reviews. The caramelized sweetness of the meat complements the tanginess of the dressing. The kids love to pick and choose their herb garnish, and we love having chopped peanuts as well as lime slices available as extra garnish. This can be served with or without the mango. It is much, much more filling than one would expect, thus is served as an entree in our home. This is very similar to Vietnamese Vermicelli with grilled meat and salad. Process could be used with beef or chicken.

This is a very tasty salad but way to much work. It was a 3 day project between cutting the meat, marinating it, cooking it, and making the salad and dressing. Prepare to put major time aside. I can't see making it again.

What a great summer salad. I also added some blanched snow peas. My kids loved making their own combinations of salad ingredients. The dressing was great.

Very tasty. I've had versions of this salad at a vietnamese restaurant where it's served rolled up in rice paper. A swell presentation for a buffet or picnic.

Refreshing summertime salad! I marinated and grilled a pork tenderloin instead of the butt, wonderful marinade. I loved the freshness of the herbs and dressing. I wasn't fond of the carrots and will only use half a an english cucumber next time.

Refreshing summertime salad! I marinated and grilled a pork tenderloin instead of the butt. Great combination of fresh herbs and the marinade and the dressing were delicious. One thing--I didn't care for the carrots in this recipe and only needed half of one english cucumber.
