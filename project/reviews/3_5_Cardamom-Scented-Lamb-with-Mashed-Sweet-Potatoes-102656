This is the first lamb dish I have ever made. For my first attempt at lamb, I think I did a good job. I am not a huge fan of lamb to begin with, but my husband is, so I tried. The sauce was thinner than I would have liked and didn't look very appetizing. I made mashed potatoes instead of sweet potatoes and put the sauce on top of the potatoes, which was pretty good. It took a lot longer to cook than the recipe says, but that could be the fault of my crappy oven. I will make lamb again, but with a different sauce.

The lamb, sweet potatoes and swiss chard were superb, but, the sauce did not turn out well. It was as if the tomato paste coagulated with he butter, and never disseminated into the sauce. THe tomato remained sort of a muddy layer. My interest is piqued by another reader's suggestion of a cranberry sauce. Next time I might even try my sister's elderberry sauce, or perhaps a marsala-cream sauce. With three such stong components, there must be a 'right' sauce that will compliment the good elements. Suggestions, anyone?

I thought i would like this dish more. the cardomon was overwhelming (and I used less than called for) and I was disappointed in the sauce, which did not especially go with the sweet potatoes. (or the cardomon). too much mustard. On the plus side the sweet potatoes were good and the directions for cooking the lamb, perfection. But rack of lamb is a real luxury food - I wish I had fixed them another way.

Absolutely wonderful! My guest could not stop raving. He loved the sauce, although I found it a bit tangy (I will cut down on the tomato paste next time). The cardamom for the lamb was fantastic; I also made a spice-rub with garlic as another reader suggested. I served this with kale sauteed in garlic and mashed sweet potatoes (added a little heavy cream to the potatoes recipe). Started the meal with a goat-cheese salad and ended it with butterscotch baked pears and we had a fine dining experience!

I will make this again. I made it the first time with the mashed sweets, but hubby wasn't too keen on them and the second time I made it with a barley dish--much better! But the lamb and the sauce were wonderful.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was wonderful. I used a good sauv blanc for the sauce and added garlic to the spice rub as suggested. I would suggest getting a frenched rack of lamb so that the spices are not lost on the layer of fat on a normal rack. I also used all chicken stock/broth because I didn't have beef. The sauce took much longer to reduce down but I just kept it boiling while the lamb was in the oven until it got to 1 1/4c. I cooked up some spinach instead of swiss chard (not sure if we even have it in Australia..) and it suited the dish perfectly. Will definitely make it again, perfect for guests.

We liked the cardamon on the lamb and would make that again but the sauce turned out tasteless and so I tossed it and used a cranberry/madeira sauce (modified from another recipe in this site as an accompaniament (sp?) for pork tenderloin. The mashed sweet potatoes were a nice complement to the lamb ...

Simply fabulous. We made this for a small dinner party, accompanied by pureed parsnips and sweet potatoes (from this site) and buttered haricot verts, and every plate was cleaned. The only (minor) mistake we made was chickening out on using the full recommended quantity of cardamom; next time we'll do it right. The sauce for this dish is superb, and would probably work equally well with other meats. Will definitely entertain with this one again.

No fancy words for this, just YUM YUM YUM! I accompanied this with the Spiced Red Cabbage recipe from this website and garnished the entire plate with minced flat parsley for a beautiful, colorful presentation. To make it even easier I used a boneless sirloin roast - less work and fat. I must confess I can't make lamb without garlic so I mixed minced garlic, fresh black pepper and ground cardamom for the spice rub. We will have this again and again.. Would be a great sub for Thanksgivers tired of turkey!

We made this with an unusual twist... we used vegetarian lamb! (Don't cringe... you never would have known it wasn't meat) It was so amazing. The sauce totally makes the dish. The mashed sweet potatoes and chard were the perfect complements!

Oh My God. My mom still can't stop talking about this meal (served as suggested, with the mashed sweet potatoes and the swiss chard)--it is her avowal that she has never had a better meal, at home or at a restaurant. I particularly liked it because cardamom is a spice I just don't use that often, so it was a real pleasure to have a meal that was infused with it. The lamb I used was some leg of lamb off the bone that was hanging around in the freezer--I just seared it in medallion form and didn't bother with the oven. I also only had a scant tablespoon of whole cardamom, but it was just the right amount to spice one side of the medallions, which was fine. The sauce did take longer to reduce by half, and I used straight chicken stock because I couldn't find a beef stock that didn't contain MSG!

The sauce for this was devine. I used all beef stock because I didn't want to have two half empty cans of stock in my refrigerator and the flavor was still great.

This dish was absolutely delicious. What makes it truly special is the sauce. I found that I had to cook the sauce for a lot longer to get it reduced to a cup and half, and it was a very nice, thick consistency that worked beautifully with the flavor of the lamb. The mashed sweet potatoes completed the flavors of the lamb and the sauce quite well, as did the red chard I served with it. Yum!

I have made this dish twice in the last two weeks - it is wonderful! I substituted cardamom powder for the cardamom seeds, and mustard powder for the mustard seeds. It was quicker, and just as good. Also, use low sodium broth and unsalted butter for the sauce. I have passed this recipe on to all of my friends. My boyfriend loved it.
