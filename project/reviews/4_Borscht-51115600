I thought this recipe was great! For a veggie only recipe the flavour was amazing. Sweet, sour and everything a borscht should be! I also put shredded beet into the soup as well as the other ingredients. It flushed out the soup and gave it a little extra oomph!

As this is a two-step process (beet broth and then finished soup) it is a little more time-consuming than standard borscht, but still quite easy. I did not put all of the beets into the broth, saving some to julienne and cook in the soup, so as to have a real beet "presence" in the finished product. Taking my cue from another reviewer, I used the beet greens in the soup instead of kale and waited a day before eating. The borscht is lovely and light. Served with a dollop of yogurt and the more decadent labneh.

I made this soup today, and it's delicious. I used the food processor's grating blade to grate the beets, carrots, and onions. I also used a pressure cooker to make the stock -- it only takes 30 minutes (vs. 2 hrs) with the pressure cooker. The beets that I purchased had beautiful greens attached, so I used those in place of the kale. The soup is much better the 2nd day. I love beets and I like that this recipe is all veg.; this will be my go-to borscht recipe.

So, wait...this soup has no actual beets in the soup? Just cabbage, kale, and one little old carrot? Can actually call it borscht if it has only beet broth and no beets?
