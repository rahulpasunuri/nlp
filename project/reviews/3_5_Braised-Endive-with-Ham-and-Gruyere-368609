This was delicious!! I tweaked it somewhat in my preparation and added carmalized onions and paprika.

As written, with over a tablespoon of nutmeg, it does not work. I assume it is a typo. I'd use less than a teaspoon. After making the adjustment, it is very good and would rate 4 forks.

Easy. 2 pinches of nutmeg are sufficient. Add a limited amount of the delicious cooking liquid, enough to make a med. sauce. Add half the cheese to the sauce and the other half on top. A winner!

I am jumping on the bandwagon! This dish was really popular when I lived in Belgium in the 1970s. Back then, it seemed a little bitter to my American palette. Now, it seems like pure comfort food.

I just made this recipe last week, we ate this growing up, it's very Dutch and we called it witlof. My parents were always excited when the Belgian Endive was available to buy (it wasn't common here years ago). I use only the endive broth, not milk for the sauce and we use Gouda cheese melted into the sauce. It's delicious.

Yummy, Very much like my mother's recipy. She made this dish during winter months when I was (much) younger in Belgium and the Netherlands. The only difference in her method was cooking the endives much less prior to assembly and baking (approx. 5 minutes only).

I have a very similar recipe also handed-down to me by my grandmother. I tried this one because there were minor differences and I was curious. I loved it! Because I do not like nutmeg very much, I only used the 1 tsp. I might try adding more next time, but I truly enjoyed the dish with just that amount. Thanks for briging back the good memories.
