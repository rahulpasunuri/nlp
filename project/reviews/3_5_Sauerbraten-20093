Oops - from recent review forgot to say that I misread and for my halved marinade I used 3/4 c vinegar and 3/4 cup red wine. Actually more like 1 c of red wine. So basicallyl I upped the red wine to match the vinegar.

I wasn't sure how big my round roast was and I halved the marinade. When the "roast" was defrosed I saw it was a very large steak! So after 3 days of marinating I had to roll and tie it. Also, another SNAFU was running out of red wine vinegar and so I used apple cider vinegar. Well, this came out surprisingly good. It cooked in less time (maybe being rolled). It was fine the first night (haven't tried it yet the 2nd). Even my teenage son who is very finicky liked it. I served it with homegrown boiled potatoes that were put in a ricer, with butter and milk. Besides the vinegar type, followed the recipe exactly. This was a great meal.

This was a hit at a recent dinner party that we hosted. We are thinking of making it an annual event to celebrate Oktoberfest - all invitees want to return... Very very good..

Really more 3.5 than a 3-star. This is the best pot roast recipe I know. The other ones, for all the veggies and wine and slow-cooking, can't come close to the fantastic sweet-sour flavor of this dish. Leftovers are to-die-for! My modifications: I used a 3 lb eye round roast, a less fatty cut which yielded great results (otherwise you're skimming tons of fat from the gravy). Also, given the meat was halved, I still did not have enough gravy to last all the leftovers. If you're making the full roast, I would definitely double the gravy ingredients.

i made this for a friend whose german grandmother used to make for her years ago, and she loved it, we all loved it and it was eaten down to the last scrap, i thought i would have to throw the whole thing out before i added the gingersnaps, it was just to sharp and tart, in went the snaps and it was transformed.

This was excellent and (to someone raised in a very German household) absolutely authentic. I increased the wine to match the vinegar (I remembered equal parts) boiled the marinade before pouring it on the meat. Marinading it for 3 days is no big deal and definitely worth the effort. Grinding the ginger snaps in a food processer helped with the texture of the gravy.

I just made this recipe and followed the directions as stated in the recipe. It was delicious. Everyone raved about it - it served eight of us with plenty left over (starting with 6 lb. of meat). The only thing I would have done differently would be to make it a day ahead of time, as the flavors would have had more time to blend, but it was find cooking and serving the same day. I did use the gingersnaps, which gave the gravy an interesting flavor. It marinated for the three days, and I turned it twice daily. We paired it with a red cabbage dish and some potato dumplings - great Oktoberfest dinner.

The 1963 recipe is better than the other two sauerbraten recipes on this site but still needs to be updated. Again, the gratuitous gingersnaps need to be omitted. First-don't chop your onions. Just pierce 2 onion halves with cloves and place in marinade. Secondly-if you marinate it for such a short period of time, then the flavors will be somewhere between a brasato and a sauerbraten, but if guests are not adventurous, that may be ok. When cooking on the stove, add some peeled winter veggies to make it a more interesting roast. Brown in olive oil, omit the shortening and the flour. Not necessary.Cook on a very very low heat, flip the meat every 20 minutes or so. After you take it out, for the gravy: don't add anything, just reduce it. A thin gravy is ok for sauerbaten. No need to recook it again. This modifications reduce the caloric content and bring the recipe back to its roots. A sauerbraten can be a lovely memorable dish.

This recipe is just fantastic...I had an Oktoberfest at my house last night - served 6 different dishes and this one was the one that guests went nuts over!!! I did add 1 cup of beef broth to the mixture before I simmered it. I placed it in a cassolet dish in the oven at 300 degrees for 3 hours. Let stand for about 2 hours and made the gravy. For the gravy...I added 1 package of Knorrs brown gravy mix and 9 gingersnaps. I pureed the gravy and then pressed through a strainer. OMG it was nirvana!!!!

Followed the recipe - yuck! The sauce was lumpy and tastless.

Excellent! Very simple, flavor is wonderful. The best gingersnap gravy I've found!

I made this with a Venison roast. I was leary of the ginger snaps, but the gravy was perfect. I didn't strain out the onions from the marinade, they ended up cooking down and lending more texture to the stock. Per my partner, the meal was wonderful, the meat was fork tender, he worked at a German restaurant for 20 years and was still impressed. I served with Red Cabbage Confit from this site and noodles. Next time with endeavor to make spaetzle.

Exceptional, Try this with potato dumplings

After spending over 15 years in Germany and eating MANY servings of wonderful sauerbraten, this is the CLOSEST and BEST recipe that I've ever made. My entire family enjoyed this with crusty rolls and a lightly seasoned vinagrette salad. Gutten Appetit!!!

I've never had sauerbraten before, so I'm not sure if it is supposed to taste the way it did when I made it. The meat was very good; I marinated it for three days and used wine and vinegar without water. But the thing that ruined it for me was the gravy. I just don't like the gingersnaps in the gravy. It might just be me or the type of gingersnaps I used, but I think I'll leave them out next time. ew!

Wanted something different for Easter dinner - this was different and OUTSTANDING! All of the guests at the table, including my 2 small grandsons, loved it. I in turn felt a little like a James Beard chef. As a previous reviewer suggested I substituted red wine for the water.

This is one of the easiest dishes I've ever made. It is a perfect guest recipe, prep it, leave it and tend to guests. Save a few minutes for the gravy assembly at the end. Family and friends have raved about the "restaurant" quality of this dish. I serve it with egg noodles or potato dumplings and red cabbage.

Was skeptical...marinate for 1-3 days, cook for 4-5 hours...sounded 'old'! It is delicious!

A very good classic sauerbraten - but one day would never do, and 5 would be better. I also brown the meat in bacon grease (it really does change the flavor) and serve it with homemade spaetzle - YUM!!

Made this for an Octoberfest dinner last weekend. I used a sirloin tip roast, used all red wine instead of water, and added sour cream to the sauce. Also, marinated it for 3 full days. Very tender and delicious. Everyone loved it!

This was a delightful meal. It tasted like a very authentic, traditional Sauerbraten. The gravy was outstanding and there was plenty of it. It was well worth the three day marination process!

Tasty tender meat and delicious gravy

I've served this dish for years, the only difference is that I add a sliced lemon to the marinade. It makes the house smell heavenly while cooking and the left overs make great sandwiches on french bread.

Well received by the family. I had a somewhat bigger roast and more than doubled the marinade. Also increased slightly the sugar and (a little too much) the gingersnaps. BUT it was a hit.

This made a wonderful meal for a German Christmas. We had spaetzle and red cabbage along with it and German Chocolate Cake for dessert. It was fun to make it a 2-3 day event! It takes a long time - but it's worth it.
