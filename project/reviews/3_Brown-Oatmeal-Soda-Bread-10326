Ohmygosh... the overwhelming taste was baking soda. Next time I will reduce to 1 tsp. if that doesn't work I will check out another recipe. Good texture & crumb.

Really easy, quick, and good bread for when you're in a hurry. Tastes a lot like biscuits, but without all the fat. This is a must have recipe for the baker who never buys store bought bread. Making this bread takes the same amount of time as riving to the store anyway, so you might as well. Very tasty.

This was very good, with the following adjustments: soak the oatmeal in the buttermilk for 10 minutes or so to soften it up, then add it as directed. Add a tbsp of sugar. Soaking the oatmeal keeps the bread from drying out (you may need a little bit more buttermilk than the recipe specifies) and the sugar really brings out the taste of the whole grain.

This is the best brown bread recipe I have made to date. It cuts beautifully into paper thin slices and is delicious for open faced sandwiches. I think next time I will add caraway seeds. I think this will be a year round thing for me now.

A wonderful bread - quick to prepare and bake (although I had to bake mine an extra 10 minutes). I baked mine on my pizza stone for an extra crunchy crust. Has a wonderful hearty oat & wheat flavor. Fabulous with the Irish Beef Stew. A keeper.

I love this recipe and have made it again and again! It has a wonderful nutty flavor and is great for mopping up corn beef and cabbage or smeared with soft butter and honey. A keeper!

This bread got rave reviews. I cut back on the flour suggested in the recipe, and that may have made the difference. I also baked it for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.

Yummmm! I'm not allowed to have bread with yeast. This bread is very filling and satisfying; and no yeast.

Contrary to the other review I have read about this recipe, my loaves came out of the oven moist and fragrant. Irish soda bread is supposed to have simple whole grain taste and this one is wonderful and filling. Just like Grandma made! Highly recomended but don't overwork the dough, it should be rather sticky inside when put in the oven, also took about 40 minutes at 350.

I was disappointed in this bread. I found it to be very dry and with little flavor. It crumbled with slicing, making for messy serving.
