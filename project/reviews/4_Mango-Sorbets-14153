Ok. Very easy, but too much sugar even using less. Only thing that saved it was extra lime juice and freezing made the sweet a little less overpowering. Next time I'm going to use much less sugar and infuse some raw ginger slices into the simple syrup.

Loved this! I didn't have lime juice so used lemon juice instead. I also added 2 tsps of vodka to prevent it freezing as hard as a rock. Might try 3 tsps of vodka next time as they were still a little hard. I chose to use a silicon mold so I could freeze individual portions for the two of us--I used one shaped like a chrysanthemum so very pretty presentation. Drizzle with raspberry syrup. And it is so simple to make!

OK, I had 2 jumbo mangoes, weighing 3 pounds, so I cut the recipe down and used 2 T lime juice and 3/4 C simple syrup and it was far too sugary. Next time I'll use less. My teeth hurt, and I just don't see the point of this much extra sugar when using very ripe sweet mangoes.

We made this as a coping mechanism for the recent northeast heat wave. Delicious relief! Wish I'd doubled it.

My 8 year old daughter made this for Father's Day in minutes. It is a perfect dessert when entertaining - you can make it ahead of time and the crowd will love it. TIP: Recipe can be doubled and still fit into a standard ice cream maker.

This sorbet is fast, easy and delicious. It also is beautifully presented in the mango shells. Very refreshing for summer!

The presentation within the skins is a nice touch. It was much easier to peel than I expected. I used a spoon and my fingers to free the pulp from the skins. They did not tear. I've been making sorbet for many years. This is simple yet outstanding. I will definitely make it for guests.

This recipe was very easy to cut in half. We had only 2 mango's to use and it was a perfect sorbet. Light and mild with great texture. We used ice cream dishes since it was for the 2 of us only and we did not need it to be fancy. This sorbet is delightful and my husband declared it a definate keeper!

Yummm!! This is the 4th time I've made this. I grate the zest of the lime and add it to the syrup before blending. Gives it a fantastic lift!

I made this for a late summer party on the deck. The mango shells made great serving "dishes" that could be tossed in the compost after we were done. I served them with shaved bits of dark chocolate on top. Every single person (18 of 'em!) requested the recipe.

Delicious! Didn't do the mango shells, served in martini glasses with sprigs of mint. Very pretty, and believe me -- NO leftovers!

The flavor and texture of this sorbet are great! I used 4 tablespoons of lime juice to make it a bit more tart! Wonderful.

I didn't bother with all the skin stuff. I just used the recipe for measurements. When mangoes are in season down here in Florida, this sorbet is a wonderful treat.

I made this recipe as a proto-type for my friends resturant. He serves a fruit sorbet as an intermizzo. Mangos are plentyful in our area and his resturant is very "mangoesque". It was such a hit he now serves it with great revues. I make batches for my friends and family. We love it. Just make sure you use quality mangos and blend in small amounts in your blender. Check the blades for strings and don't let them fall into the ice cream maker. Enjoy!
