Terrific recipe! I made it with equal parts orange and lemon, as suggested by the first reviewer. It is great with chicken and pork. Very easy, too.

This is one of my family's all time favorites. We like it on toast, bagels, pancakes, ice cream. I usually use equal parts lemon and oranges....and leave out raisins sometimes...pecans are too in this too.
