Wow! I confess that although I have discovered the joy of kale in the last few years, I have never been attracted to chard. All that has changed! I prepared a half recipe of this dish as described (omitting the butter which I don't eat) and ate the entire bowl in minutes. Absolutely delicious.

I used much less oil and substituted rice vinegar and only 1 tbsp of butter. I also use a combo of kale & chard, and prefer the "organic" version from store. My 3.5 yr old and husband love it, we've had it three times in 2 weeks!

As a southerner I'm always ineresteed in recipes involving any kind of greens and this one is exceptional! I used swiss chard and kale and had insted of shallots I used a lone leek which was in the fridge!

Nope, this wasn't good. I have been trying to like kale, but no matter how I prepare it it is bitter and hard to chew. This recipe did not solve the kale problem for me.

Couldn't get enough! Cut out the stems for sure of swiss chard and even kale or you'll end up with a "woody" taste. Made it last weekend for my husband as a "test" since we're having company this weekend. Leftovers were great the second night and can't wait to make it again

I made this yesterday and loved it. I did not use pepper flakes or salt and pepper but put in some cooked chicken. Will make again today, couldn't get enough.

took one look at some key ingredients and cut oil , butter and vinegar 1/2--that's like greens soup if you don't. That's way too much salt for our tastes, so it gets cut, too. I make this adjusted dish often.

I've always been "afraid" to eat kale, but this recipe is excellent! I made it exactly as written and will do so again.

Delicious! I used swiss chard and the recipe was just perfect. No alterations.

Tasty, despite my efforts to ruin it with a loose capful of red pepper and an overzealous hand with the vinegar. The butter really does add such a great layer to it. I used kale and mustard greens because I couldn't find chard (sob), and as it was my first time cooking with it, it certainly took me by surprise. I'd absolutely try it again.

Granted we have exceptional organic rainbow chard here now, but this really compliments the flavor. I'll do a bit less vinegar next time, but the shallots, garlic & red pepper give a nice kick and the butter is so decadent.
