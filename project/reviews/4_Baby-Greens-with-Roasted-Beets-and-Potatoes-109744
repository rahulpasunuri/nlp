Oh...and I heated the beets in a little of the dressing just before I served the salad because I think that warm beets taste so much better than cold beets.

I modified this to use mostly stuff on hand and to make it a starter salad for a dinner party. I used rice vinegar, elimnated the potatoes, combined Bibb lettuce with crisp romaine and spinach, subbed finely chopped celery for the lovage and bronze fennel foliage for the chervil and skipped the nasturiums. Bottom line, a wonderful combo of unexpected flavors that surprise and delight the palate. Every person remarked on how good the salad was. It's a keepr.

I made a simplified version of this salad, using only fingerling potatoes, red and golden beets, dill, arugula, and dijon vinaigrette (I replaced the vinegar with lemon in the vinaigrette). This salad is beautiful, simple, tasty, and filling. I will definitely make it again, but I'll go to the market next time so that I have all the ingredients!

This is a delightful salad right out of a great Paris bistro. Very French...the tarragon, the chervil contrasted with the beet and the baby potatoes with a delicate, well flavored vinaigrette. Yum! But who can find (or ever heard of) Lovage in California??? We used both red and gold beets, did without the Lovage, and enjoyed it tremendously. You must have high quality fresh ingredients for this one...that's what makes it great!

This is the perfect early summer salad. I found everything in the farmer's market - including a lovely little lovage plant. I served it with grilled chicken and garlicky grilled bruschetta. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper!
