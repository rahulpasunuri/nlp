Fantastic cake. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the butter in the topping to 1/2 cup and combined it with the brown sugar over heat, sliced the bananas a bit more thickly, added two small bananas to the batter and baked it in a 10" pan. The cake had just the right amount of banana flavor and the topping was delicious. This is a great alternative to banana bread for those over ripe bananas.

Yum. Just made this on a whim, and I am so glad I did. At the suggestion of other reviewers I cut the butter for the topping in half, but I had to return the caramel to the stove to melt the sugar a bit more. I also added a banana to the batter. I made it in a 10" pan, which worked out perfectly. This recipe couldn't be any easier!

I have made this cake too many times to count and each time, it gets better. Caution to be careful with the sugar & butter combo as it will boil over the edges. Springform pan works exceptionally well and with a dalop of hagen daz - this is by far the best fall/winter dessert around. Family members love it and it is always requested as a "birthday" cake for adults - all of the family.

Made this recipe as is and it was fantastic. The cake texture is beautifully moist - served warm with fresh cream poured over. My only problem was getting the caramel done - I had to return the pan to a low heat and stir to get the butter and suger to amalgamate (could it be too much butter as others have stated?). This cake is so great - thinking of trying this again with apple slices...

I made this twice (first time I wasn't sure I'd one it justice) and didn't like it much. I followed the previous suggestions and for the topping cut the butter in half. The topping was fine, can't imagine using the original component of butter. I didn't like the cake itself. I thought it lacked flavor, and was coarsely-textured. The cake took longer in my oven to bake than the orignally- suggested one hour--about 75 minutes. Warning: if you use a spring form pan (which I did) wrap the bottom in foil to prevent leaking.

this was great. i added a little toasted coconut and put 1 1/2 bananas into the cake. I also reduced the butter to about 2 tbsp in each part so that made it a bit tricky. the topping was bubbling up (i also baked it in a loaf pan) and i thought the whole thing was going to be a disaster. but it tasted great.

I, too, cut the amount of butter for the topping in hald and sliced the bananas a bit thicker. I made this in individual ramekins ahead of time and, while we were eating a roast for dinner, popped them into a warm oven. They came out easily and it made the presentation notable. I've already had a request to repeat.

I wasn't expecting anything exciting, but it turned out to be a real treat. The top was sweet and the warm cake was nice on a chilly night. I did take out half the butter in the topping but it still turned out wonderfully.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe after the rave reviews. I followed it as written and only reduced the butter by a bit as another reviewer sugguested. If I were to make it again I would cut the bananas thicker and maybe add a mashed banana to the cake batter for a stronger taste.

I made this cake in a springform pan lined with parchment paper. I made the sugar/butter/banana base(topping) first and set it aside until I was ready to go ahead. It was delicious! However, next time I might try to cut what seemed like too much butter in the topping.

I've made this 3 times so far and it's been a favorite. Out of guilt, I've cut back on the amount of butter in the glaze to about half and it still tastes great! Thicker bananas works nicely, too.

I first made this cake in 1996 then lost the recipe. My nine-year-old would tell everyone it was his favorite cake although he'd only had it once--when he was five! He is delighted that I have tracked this recipe down. He will turn 10 this month and (yee-haw!) finally get to taste his "favorite" cake again! Hey! Try serving it in a puddle of chocolate fudge sauce...mmmm.

Very delicious cake but make sure you use the correct size pan with high sides! I've made it twice and both times it overflowed in my oven! What a mess!!! Otherwise very very tasty!

My honey pie gives this 4 forks - I would give it only 3 because it does not involve chocolate. I recommend using more bananas and cutting them thicker. Goofed and cooled the cake too long - this was remedied by placing pan over steam a few minutes and then it loosened fine.
