Delicious without any significant tweaking. Follow the instructions with regard to roasting some of the peppers and sauteeing others to yield a rich flavor that isn't too smoky. The flavor of the butter, by the way, really is a component of the finished product; I tend to cut fat whenever possible, but this is one of the places I might prefer to keep it in. As an alternative, perhaps one could saute in olive oil instead and then drizzle some good olive oil over the top to serve. Watch the yield estimate given here, however--the serving recommendation is 'in tiny cups,' which is where the '10-12' servings comes from. As a meal, this serves more like 4-6 at best, but it is indeed hearty enough to serve as a main course with some good bread.
