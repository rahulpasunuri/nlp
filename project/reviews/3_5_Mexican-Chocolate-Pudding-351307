I give this two stars because it was good but not great, and I have half a quart of almond milk leftover. I thought there was too much cinnamon. The pudding set up fine, but it didn't look like it would. I stopped cooking after the one minute of boiling, and it was pretty soft, but once cold it was nice and thick. I think the longer you cook thickeners they can lose their thickening power. I've had that problem with gravy where it there's a point of no return and if it's overcooked it's like there's no thickener at all.

To achieve the right consistency, you have to add the almond milk to the dry ingredients in the pan. If you add the dry to the wet, oops, no pudding. I love this recipe, don't add the butter (makes me feel less guilty), but otherwise follow it exactly. Yum!

Argh, and yes, I do rate it 4 forks. I forgot to vote!

I made this recipe exactly as is, only changing the almond milk with organic skim milk. I also boiled the pudding for 2 minutes, as I live at 7060'. The flavor is remarkable, dense and rich without being heavy. I also doubled the recipe as my guy can eat anything without gaining a pound, and he's 51, the rat. I'm glad I doubled it because I know it will be eaten!

I also used cow's milk and 3T cornstarch and the pudding was a bit firm, but delicious! Next time I may try 2 3/4T for a more pudding like outcome. Very good with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon on top!

I substituted 6T of flour for cornstarch. It came out delicious! Highly recommend. I would also suggest a lightly sweetened whipped cream.

I made this with regular (cow's) milk, 3 tbsp cornstarch, and 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and it came out just right!

I enjoyed this recipe. I would rate it three forks, but since I made some changes (and want to avoid the tirades that sometimes causes), I'll just add my comments. I took a previous reviewer's advice to add some additional cornstarch; I used a total of 3 Tbsp, and the pudding thickened nicely. I also added about 1/4 tsp. of ancho chili powder. Finally, I made my own almond milk (easy if you have a blender), and the recipes I found were split on whether you should strain out the tiny bits of almond. I elected to leave them in but would probably strain them out next time for a smoother texture. It did need the whipped cream, but instead of plain, I would probably sweeten it just a bit and maybe add some cinnamon next time.

The pudding was a little loose. I will add about a 1 T of cornstarch next time. But I did enjoy the flavor the almond milk added.

Great taste and mouth-feel, but the consistancy was a little gummy/saucy. As I whisked I wondered if the brown sugar would produce a carmel-y consistancy. I like the use of the almond milk and will probably use it for another pudding.

mine turned into a nice thick pudding no problem, very yummy! My husband, who usually is not a sweets person, loved it. Whipped cream would have been a good touch, as it was pretty rich.

Never gelled. I cooked it forever; don't know what happened. Ended up drinking the liquid with a straw. Tasty, but not pudding.

Deliciously chocolatey with a nice touch of cinnamon. Only complaint was that the pudding was a bit more liquidy than I would like. Also, it is very rich so it works well with some whipped cream!
