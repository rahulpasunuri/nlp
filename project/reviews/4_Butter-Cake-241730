I made this yesterday. The cake is nicely solid and does have a wonderful butter flavor. I'm going to agree with some though that the temp should probably be set at 350. My mistake was frosting it with a heavy cream cheese icing. It's a little over powering. Just a dusting of powdered sugar would have been better I think. Well.... next time. And yeah, I'll make it again.

This cake has a nice tight crumb and it wasn't too sweet, which I liked. It started browning too fast in the oven and even though I tented it with foil, it still came out toasty. I would bake it at 350 rather than 375.

Nothing particularly exciting, it's a solid cake but nothing special. Also, I found that the edges and top came out too browned, perhaps some heating/timing tweakage would be in order (I had used the minimum).

This cake has a delicious buttery flavour. The recipe is very quick and easy. It is a little bit crumbly if not allowed to cool completely.

This was a good cake, but nothing spectacular. I was expecting much more after reading the praise from the other reviews. I wouldn't bother making it again.

Good flavor, very loose crumb. Make sure to refrigerate to cool completely before trying to slice and layer.

I just made mini square cakes from this recipe. These came out soft, fluffy and quite delicious with out being so sweet. I substituted the all purpose flour for cake flour and used lemon instead of orange for the zest. Baked at 350 for 17 min. Yummers!

I love the recipe as is-- don't leave out the orange zest. Also- note that this is not a high-rising cake. Cake pan should be almost to the top. I have used toasted coconut instead of the orange peel, coconut milk instead of whole milk and coconut extract instead of vanilla-- it was a delicious coconut cake too!

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out moist and flavorful. I made a 6" cake and several cupcakes with the leftover batter. This has been my favorite butter cake recipe by far.

Super easy and delicious. Did not have orange zest, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Turned out beautifully. Will definitely try making two layers and putting fruit/buttercream in between next time.

Easy to make and delicous, I use lowfat yogurt instead of milk.I have plenty of oranges and lemons so I'll serve it for many occasions to come.

Moist, fresh and flavorful - my friends and family LOVED this cake when I served it up for dessert at a dinner party. I doubled the recipe and made it into a layer cake with a whipped cream icing (make a basic cream cheese icing vanilla and fold in homemade whipped cream). Topped with sliced fresh strawberries - I looked like a dessert goddess. :-D

this was a great easy cake recipe. I substituted cake flour for the all purpose flour. When the cake cooled I sliced it in half and filled it with a fresh peach and whipped cream filling. The cake had a great flavor and texture.
