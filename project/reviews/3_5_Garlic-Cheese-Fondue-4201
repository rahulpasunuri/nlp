For those of you making cheese fondue for the first time, here are a few notes. Make sure to grate the cheeses , this is not a step that can be skipped or you will have trouble getting the cheeses to melt and blend. Add the flour to the grated cheese being carefull to disperse it evenly. Add the cheese to the simmering wine by the handfull, stirring continuously. The recipe will reflect the quality of the cheeses. I always look for imported Swiss cheeses, worth the extra $$.s.

This fondue is delightful. The cheeses melt very well, even when re-heating. In addition to the usual manner of consumption, I found this to be a good spread for use on bread with veggis or meats, and delicious melted into an omelet.

This recipe totally works. You can also substitute a good beer - like a Belgian trippel - for the white wine, for a different but shockingly awesome flavor.

This is such an easy recipe. Have never had to worry about getting the baked on cheese out of my fondue pot! A backseat foodie was sure I was going to screw it up with all the wine, but it came out perfect...like it does every other time. I followed the spice additions of earlier reviewers.

Overall, great flavor but needs more garlic. Can't wait to try it again!

As with other reviewers I did have a problems with getting the cheese to melt. I had to wisk it alot and increase the heat to above medium to get the cheese to melt. At some points it was simmering, but the the finished product was good.

This fondue was very good. I did have to add about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup more wine to make the consistancy right for dipping (2 cups total). I served this with bread, mushrooms, broccoli, and cut-up cooked beef roast. Exceptional!

To begin with I cant cook. I had a really difficult time getting the gruyere cheese to melt into the swiss cheese. Also, I my have added too much wine. This meal turned out to be a disaster.

DELICIOUS! But how can you go wrong with melted cheese. We love garlic so always add more.

I didn't have any complaints. I really enjoyed this dish. The recipe is flawless

One thing I notice is that if I use a lesser quality cheese the consistency comes out stringier than normal. I've made this many times and love the recipe... but try to make sure I have the better cheese on hand. The better flavor and consistency is worth the effort and a few dollars.

I can't really give this a bad review as so many others had success with it I can only believe I made a mistake. The cheese never really melted. It was stringy and not really a "dip" consitancy. HOwever we spent a great deal of money buying top quality cheese so we ate it anyway. The taste was quite good, but the texutre was pretty bad. I would encourage others to try it out. I would like to know what I did wrong. Maybe the heat was too low? I kept stirring as I added more cheese. Maybe didn't let the cheese incorporate before I added more. I may try it again.

Aside from the fact that it doesn't include Beaufort this is a classic recipe. In answer to the person who said it was stringy that is usually due to one of two things: if you don't add the cheese gradually as suggested it's hard to correct and if you let the fondue sit too long before serving it the cheeses can separate. A third possibility is inferior cheese. Bon ap!

I made this dish for a New Years party. While it was an easy dish to make, and had a creamy texture, I could barely taste the garlic. I would recommend adding more garlic then what's suggested in the recipe.

Rating: 2
Graat flavor, but a stringy texture that made it messy to eat and difficult to clean. I followed the recipe exactly and personally thought the garlic was overpowering, but it was a hit at our New Years Eve party (although it paled in comparison with the chocolate fondue).

This was a Xmas eve hit! We served it with carrots/broccoli/sourdough cubes/supersweet cherry tomatoes & red seedless grapes. About half way thru we diced sundried tomatoes and added them into the fondue! MOST YUMMY!

I have made this recipe time and time again. It has been a hit at dinner parties, cocktail parties and I have even been able to make it and bring it for a concerts in the park picnic successfully. I usually add a bit more garlic and white pepper than the recipe calls for but stick with all the ingrediates in the original recipe. But I would like to share one variation that I did this evening. I went to a friends house and which I bought the cheeses for the fondue thinking that my friend would have the necessary spices and flour but no. The recipe went as this...Normal ingrediates that I used were...swiss and gryere cheese, white wine, fresh garlic and white pepper, but instead of nutmeg I used a bit of cinnamon and since there was no flour or corn starch I resorted to using bread crumbs which amazingly enough, did the job. I still absolutely love the orginal but was amazed at the outcome with a few variations..

I'm not sure what went wrong for the other reviewers -- my fondue wasn't stringy at all. i added a bit extra garlic and used some cheddar 'cause my boyfriend adores it -- it was great as a casual fondue. great texture and flavor. used apples, halved boiled new potatos, and a fresh, cubed baguette (yay carbs:))

This was a first time making fondue for me. I added a garlic clove, but otherwise loved the dish.

Very good, although what I made was a variation on this recipe. I added a couple of chopped shallots with the garlic, and I used cream instead of additional wine to thin the sauce as the cheese mixture was added. I was teaching my son some things in the kitchen as I worked, and I had him adding cheese to the wine mixture. He wasn't real patient to bring the sauce back up to temperature before adding more cheese, and the sauce started to become pretty gloppy. I stepped in and it was a completely fixable situation. My recommendation, then, would just be to make sure you keep the heat up enough to keep the cheese nicely melted. In addition to French bread, we also dipped Sourdough French bread, cubed smoked ham, lightly steamed carrots/broccoli/asparagus, portobello mushroom pieces tossed with herbed olive oil and roasted, and fresh baby new potatoes (skin on) tossed with melted seasoned butter and roasted. We like to fondue, and we have three pots and a deep fryer at the table. Add a nice horseradish white sauce for marinated beef/poultry/pork/sausage and a dessert fondue, and this is a fun meal.

I made this tonight and I loved it. I halved the recipe, but otherwise, I left it well enough alone. In addition to the bread, which I'm not too thrilled about, I dipped sliced green apples into the fondue. Delish!

You can always rely on Epicurious for a high quality basic recipe like this one to use as a jumping off point. We received 4 lbs. of assorted cheeses in a gift basket (provolone, camembert, gorgonzola, fontina, Portugese Azeitao, Sicilian caciocavallo and more)! I substituted a combination of all of these (about 3 oz. gorgonzola, 1 cup cubed camembert(rind removed) and about 1 cup of each of the others, grated. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and produced the most incredibly delicious fondue my family and I have ever had!

Easy to do and my family loved it. Used 1/2 lb. Emmental (instead of the i lb. of Swiss), a tablespoon (or more) of Kirsch and only 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and it was great.

I used this recipe for the first time I had ever made fondue. It was extremely simple and turned out great! I was a little overzealous with the nutmeg (which detracted from the dish), but overall I think it was a great, easy recipe!

LOVE this recipe....the cheese, the wine, the garlic...YUM. Does make a large quantity. No need to make substitutions here....this is what cheese fondue is all about!

This is very similar to the cheese fondue I usually make. One suggestion (learned in Germany) for those having trouble getting the cheese to melt -- add 1 T. kirsch or other eau de vie after you've stirred in the cheese. It helps the cheese from separating from the wine.

An absolutely suberb fondue recipe with a wonderful flavor. No problems with stringy cheese here. Can't wait to make it again!

Stick to the recipie and it might work out better... I made several adjustments to the recipie (sparkling grape juice instead of wine) (bit of mozzarella instead of 2nd cheeze) (smaller batch than in recipie) It started out fine but soon became a poor consistancy (meally instead of cheezy) possibly due to using juice instead of wine or having the pot too hot. taste was OK but not salty enough for me

I make this fondue for my family each Christmas and it has always turned out great. We do add more wine to thin it out, however, and serve it not only with bread, but with baby new potatoes and cubed ham as well. Served with a green salad, it is perfect!

My guests liked it. I didn't have a problem with stringiness. Perhaps enough wine wasn't added for those who had problems. It's a basic recipe. When I had fondue in Germany it was much more bland than this. I like this recipe better. However, I'm still looking for a fondue to crave.

I've never made fondue before, but the sauce was very string-y which made it difficult to scoop onto the bread. Frustrating. The flavor was good, but I thought it would be more like cheese sauce consistancy -- and I've made many chees sauces, so I'm at a loss of what went wrong.

This recipie sounds delish! We got a fondue pot for the holidays and plan to have a party soon. Any suggestions for wine to go with? Perhaps the illnesses are due to the richness of food. Unless you are used to very rich, fatty foods, you can get quite sick. Even though I used to eat that way, I no longer do, thus even the occasional meal of fried fish can turn my tummy. I imagine a meal of rich cheese would do the same if I didn't add some salad or extra bread to round it out.

I lived in Switzerland for 4 1/2 years and enjoyed many fabulous fondues. This recipe is exactly as it was made in the Swiss Alps. One other serving suggestion - small glasses of Kirsch in which to dip the corner of the bread before dunking into the cheese. This adds a little zip to the taste and helps in the digestion. Make sure you drink white wine, champagne or tea only - otherwise an unseasoned stomach could have difficulties. I enjoy this fondue at least twice a year!

This fondue was fun and tasted great! I boiled whole, red and white potatoes, and button mushrooms (the smallest I could find) in chicken broth, with a little salt & pepper until the veggies were just cooked, then drained. It was so much fun to have bite size servings of veggies, and of course, small chunks of SemiFreddi sourdough bread were a must!

I finally found a way to gracefully move guests from the kitchen to the living room. Everybody loves this fondue and will follow wherever it goes. I've also used this recipe as a basis for cheddar/beer fondue (substitute cheddar for swiss and beer for wine) and that also worked out well, but I think the original is still the favorite.
