The torte part was quite good. I did put the prunes in the cuisanart and they were almost pureed. I like that vs having chunks of identifiable prunes. I thought the icing was not good at all, so I scraped it off and put another fudge icing on it. Then it came out well. I just took a taste of the completed torte before I threw out the recipe and I had a change of heart! It is really delicious, very moist, but definitely opt for another icing. I am putting it in the freezer or 2 weeks....for Passover!

Made this for our seder last night. It was pretty great. My only complaint is that all the walnuts and prunes in the cake sink to the bottom. It is a heavy dense cake but very rich and very delicious. A winner for us!

I made this right by the recipe and it was alright, but I would never make it again! It is heavy. There are much better recipes on Epicurious that blow this recipe away It was also too labor intensive for what it was. My husband ate it, but he loves chocolate and anyting sweet. Too heavy.

I've made this recipe every Passover for the last 5 years. It is a bit of work, although I've been known to split it up and make over 2 days. Following the directions as written results in a fabulous looking cake. Guests always think it came from a bakery! Cake freezes well. I tried once substituting dried cherries and cherry juice for the prunes but that didn't taste as good.

I found this receipe in Bon Appetit years ago and made it for our group seder. It was a success and fullfilled every chocolate lovers dreams. I make this rich torte for every seder.

I have made this cake so many times, even for my sister´s wedding.Everybody rave about it. It is most requested chocolate cake in our family. Sometimes I use coffe with cardamom spice instead of prune juice. Try it,you will not be disappointed!

This recipe was devised by my friend, Selma Brown Morrow and I have made every Passover since it was pulished. Then I moved house and lost it from my database. DISASTER! Imagine how great I felt when I found your site and there it was. It is a great recipe and I look forward to preparing it again for all sorts of occasions. Caveat, it is very rich so a little goes a long way. Jackie O'Halloran S

I made this recipe last year for Passover (I hate Passover cakes as a rule) and brought it to the family we share Passover with. They were so disappointed that I brought 3 new desserts, that I had no choice. They all raved about the fabulous prune chocolate cake from last year. I bought the ingredients and brought it to their house for the 2nd seder - even though I would not be there. They were thrilled!!

This is a very dense, rich torte and everytime I make it people RAVE. In fact, I only have to mention the NAME of it and people are anxious to try it. I soak the prunes in orange licquior and that's VERY GOOD. SO RICH --- cut it in very small slices.

This cake is extremely dense, moist, and rich. I added about 1/3 cup of seedless raspberry preserves to the frosting and alternated fresh rapsberries with the chcocolate-dipped walnuts around the rim of the cake. It made for an attractive presentation. Make sure to cut small slices as only a thin sliver of this cake is incredibly filling.

I had to quadruple the recipe and it worked. But I only had one pan that was 9 inches --- I used the 10 inch pans which made a shorter torte, but it works better. The center solidifies at the same rate as the rest of the torte. It didn't in the 9 inch pan and was goopy. The torte is delicious and my taste testers ate one before Passover. I didn't mention the prunes until after the taste test. I used the food processor for the prunes and that makes it a lot easier that chopping them up and it didn't changed the taste, only made the texture smoother. IBC Westport,CT

The torte did not turn out very pretty. It did not have a good texture. The ingredients were expensive, and the prunes and prune juice did not seem to go with the chocolate.

A truly delicious dessert. An added bonus is that it can be made for the lactose-intolerant without any modifications whatsoever.

It was delicious and I enjoyed making it. I took it to work and everyone raved over it, even though it was very, very rich.

This is a really good passover dessert. I've made it many times and gotten rave reviews from my guests and most people never know that there are prunes in it.
