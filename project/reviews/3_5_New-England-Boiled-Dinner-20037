My family are from Boston, MA and we have been cooking this for at least 50 years. I try to make it more fresh and lively by using Polish Sausage and the dish comes out less salty and less fatty. I also add 2 bruised garlic cloves, a couple of bay leaves and substituted the 6 white onions for one large whole onion. Very simple but oh so delicious!

I grew up just north of Boston and this is extremely close to the recipe we'd have every St. Patrick's day. After years of preparing this dish I have a few tweaks to suggest. If you want to make it the way my mom did: Add some bay leaves and a whole onion at the very beginning to the meat to strain out later. If you want to make the beef less traditional but step it up a bit: Make a glaze of 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1/4 cup prepared mustard 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder Bake at 375° for about 10 minutes, basting a few times. It melts the fat that's left a little and gives the meat an amazing flavor!

Great (5 stars) if you are eating this on St. Patrick's Day and you're too drunk to taste anything. Smelled amazing, but the final outcome was just not what we were hoping for. The up side is that the vegetable base is a great start for a spank-tabulous Tikka Masala. Add some fresh spinach and cover in your favorite Tikka Masala. It is also a good base for an egg breakfast.

I've been making this for 20 years. It's that special St. Patty's Day treat. Not the best for you but my mouth is watering thinking about it.

This is the 4th year in a row that I'm making this recipe. We love it.

Would be better with regular beef and pork brisket

Very Good traditional New England boiled dinner, my mom used to make it with a pork shoulder but I prefer the brisket, not quite so fatty. No part of a boiled dinner will ever touch an oven in Boston. Really a once a year treat, not exactly health food, but boy I look forward to that "once a year"

I used a large ham hock with all the ingredience and also added the drippings from cooked Italian sausage instead of butter.

This is, to me, comfort food beyond all other comfort foods. The hours of cooking heat up the kitchen and fill the house with such a delicious smell. I love to spoon a little cooking liquid over the veggies on my plate. I used the left overs to make corned beef hash the next day. It's probably not in anyone's best interest to have this too often but I look forward to making it again.

delish, high in salt, if you are sodium sensitive then try changing the bath after the first boil.

My parents were from Boston and boiled dinner was one of the dishes I remember from my childhood. I was intrigued that a recipe from 1965 had such a high rating. There is good reason for this. This is the best corned beef and cabbage I have had anywhere. Even my 15 year-old daughter ate some and enjoyed it. I did not use salt pork, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Always looking for some new ideas, I checked this recipe out and found some great suggestion, especially the bourbon glaze. The recipe I've used for many years is similar to this however mine has these additions which I thought some of you might like to try. To the pot I add 1 onion stuck with several whole gloves, 2 bay leaves, 2 ribs of celery with leaves, 2 large garlice gloves-bruised. I also add additional mustard seeds and black peppercorns in addition to the seasoning pkg. which comes with the meat. I made the glaze with a praline/mustard sauce I had adding bourbon to taste. The brick suggestion was great. I baked it in at about 300 degrees for 20 min. or so then kept it warm while the veggies cooked with aluminum foil. I never remove anything from the water when I add the remaining vegetables-the water flavors everything. I also make a parsley butter for the potatoes. This was the best corned beef and cabbage we've made in the many years I've been making it. Yum! We always ask ourselves why do we only make this once per year on March 17th? Thanks to those who made all the great suggestions.

This was the first time I made corned beef. I combined three different recipes thereby changing, substituting and omitting ingredients -and it was all quite good. Boiled the corned beef with carrots, celery and onions. When the beef was done, strained the broth, then boiled carrots, potatoes and onions in the broth while cooking the corned beef with a glaze in the oven (glaze from the Joy of Cooking). The potatoes were the best boiled potatoes I had, and the corned beef was quite good as well! My 18-month old and 4-year-old really enjoyed it all as well!

"I'd rather have this than steak any day" "incredible" "Just fantastic - and so tender and flavorful". These were some of my husband's comments after I made this dish. Iused some reviewer's tips also on the Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe here - add beer and garlic, finish with a glaze in the oven. Skipped the salt pork, and take the fat off the meat after removing from broth.

Wonderful dinner! I used the spice packet that came with the brisket and it was just right. Be sure that you purchase a "flat cut" and not the "point cut". The point cut is hardly even fit to eat. I work, as do most, so I cooked the brisket and salt pork in the crock pot while I was at work. After I got home, I transferred it all to my stock pot and finished it up. Buy as much corned beef as you can, because it goes quickly.

Best St. Patrick's Day dinner I've prepared. Much better than basic corned beef and cabbage. A nice, subtle blend of flavors with the salt pork being essential.

I made this dinner for St. Patty day. I soon relized that even 6 1/2 lbs. of corned beef is not enough for 8 adults. I too added the beer and the pickling spice. Aside from that nothing else was changed. I served it with the horseradish sauce and that disappeared along with the meat. Fabulous boiled meal for anytime of the year.

Our first time cooking St.Pat's dinner,and it was yummy. My husband and I cooked together and enjoyed it. Great recipe we will do it again!

This is a GREAT recipe and 'yes' can't wait for St. Patty's day to do it again. I did omit the salt pork and added a cut in half, whole pod of garlic which broke up nicely into that terrific broth; yet stayed whole and creamy. A very nice accompaniment. Saved the broth in the freezer for future soups!!!

Definitely add some pickling spices if not included in package. I, also, used about one cup of dry white wine instead of the beer, which I don't keep on hand. My cooking time was much less for the beef, since I only cook for one and found a good small piece.

Wow! My husband is a Glouscester, Mass. native and is no stranger to "boiled dinner." As a new wife I am always hoping to add to our "regular rotation" menu. This version of the New England boiled dinner was better than anything my husband or I had ever experienced with boiled dinner! Thanks! It has definitely earned a spot on the "regulars" list!

i make a white sauce to go with this ( a roux with some milk and broth from the cooking pot) and as a variation I add dill

Try using HAM insead of corned beef. A 5- 8 lb semi boneless ham works great. After boiling for about an hour cut ham into sereving size chunks, add vegies and there you have it!!

I made this recipe many years ago -- everything blended and accepted the best of flavors from every other "participant," and the broth it produced was sumptuous -- eat it with fresh-made french bread!

Excellent traditional boiled dinner recipe. I used turnips, rutabags & parsnips along with other vegetables. I omitted the pork.

Excellent, I substitued some heavily smoked bacon (hickory) in place of the pork, and substituted kohlrabi for the turnip/parsnip combo. Very sat- isfying this way, as was the original recipe.

It is classic to partake of once a year! Although i do not use the salt pork, as i feel there is plenty of flavor (and fat) from cooking the beef!
