I have made this for years and am asked every time for the recipe. The best blue cheese dressing ever.

This dressing is excellent!!! Better yet serve the dressing at room temerature as a sauce for beef tenderloin. A very regal dish that got an ovation from my dinner guests when I served it like that.

A subtle, smooth, and sophisticated dressing. The final straining wasn't necessary in my case, perhaps because I did a long slow blending. The only thing left in the sieve were the black pepper grinds, which I wanted in the dressing. If another blue-veined cheese such as Gorgonzola or Roquefort is on hand, I think it would do as well as Stilton, taking care to add salt judiciously. It's too bad this dressing doesn't appear in a search for blue cheese dressings, as I think many people would enjoy it as a change from the usual chunky versions. Note: I made half the dressing, and it's enough for quite a few salads of various kinds.

I just wiped my hands off so I could get on the computer. The blender is still soaking. Nonetheless, I simply had to say how GOOD this dressing is. Try it.

This is the best homemade salad dressing I've made in years. I'm salivating just thinking about it. I've even turned a devout bleu cheese hater into a zealous fan of this sauce!
