After reading the temperature reviews I set the temperature to 350 used a 9x9 glass dish and baked for 38 min. I did not have buttermilk so I used the substitution of milk with 1-1/2 tsp. white vinegar added. Let that sit for about 10 minutes til it curdles. Came out great--my husband loved it. Had a nice spice flavor and I used a lemon sauce over it that I grew up with. Very moist and delicious.

I've made this 3 times now in the last week (buttermilk impulse purchase - Kate's packaging is fiendishly effective). I doubled the ginger, used dark molasses, and otherwise made as written. Wonderful. I love moist gingerbread, and this is it. It did take ~30 minutes to bake in a glass pyrex pan, but less time with a metal pan. Topped with a glaze of confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice, this is to die.

Delicious and very simple, although, like other reviewers, I found it took longer to cook than directions specified. I doubled the ginger (I like ginger!) and left the other quantities the same. Allow extra cooking time and you'll have a winner.

I usually steer clear of pastry recipes that others call moist because I often find them gummy, but this one was perfect. It made a light, tender cake with just the right blend of spices. I made it as directed, minus the powdered sugar. A great way to use up leftover buttermilk, but it's also worth a trip to the market to buy a fresh carton.

I loved this recipe!!Not only was it super easy (i.e one bowl) even my picky child loved it (after he got over his initial disappointment that it wasn't chocolate brownies!)

Like others, I had some leftover buttermilk I was looking to use (from the Chai Spiced Bundt Cakes AND the Milk Chocolate Cake...why don't they sell little containers in my market? I still have more!) I too doubled the spices, used dark molasses and thought it was simple, quick and delicious. I split it in half and layered in red wine poached pear slices and a creme fraiche pastry cream, then reduced the wine to a thick syrup to serve it with...which made it beyone compare...I like that there are so many ways to go.

Simple recipe--and a great use for leftover buttermilk from making fried chicken.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to use up some leftover buttermilk. This is a very quick and easy recipe to prepare. Perfect for a last minute dessert or breakfast sweet if you have all the ingredients in your pantry! The resulting moist and tender crumb and smooth spice flavor are worth repeating many more times! This gingerbread is indeed at its best when served warm, but still worth devouring even 2 days later.

This was wonderful gingerbread. My husband and kids are more into chocolate desserts but they loved these. Very moist and flavorful. I had to bake them 10 minutes longer than specified in the recipe.

Absolutely delicious, moist, yummy! I made 4 mini loafs from this recipe---everyone who tried it wound up eating the whole loaf (or almsot!) in one sitting. I used dark molasses, because I couldn't find any light in the store--and it was wonderful.

easy, light and moist, but...a bit bland.Would probably be great after a heavy meal with a little whipped cream. On it's own it is nothing special.

Thought these would be more like a bar, but really is a cake recipe. Regardless, turned out awesome - really light and soft texture, just the perfect amount of spices and molasses (not too overpowering), and so easy! Baked it a little longer than 25 minutes (as others did). Really yummy - definitely recommended.

After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a winner. I took it to book club and only one person ate it and without rave reviews from her no one else even tried it. I found it very heavy.

This was wonderful! I made it just as directed and it came out perfectly moist. It's a wonderful accompaniment to tea or mulled cider.

These are unbelievable! Everyone loves them from kids to adults! Good for company or after school snack.

Very easy. Nice and moist. A little sweet, but a good spice flavor. I doubled the recipe for a larger pan and had to cook it over 50 minutes - so all the cook time comments are right on. The low cooking temperature leads to a very soft cake. I took these to work and got lots of raves!

This is delicious gingerbread. Add one more person to this list with soupy centers. I too had to bake an extra 10-15 minutes. I added mini ginger chips (the ones from King Arthur Flour) and they just melted into the cake. I will surely make this again.

A simple, delicious recipe for the holidays. I used regular molasses, and it was wonderful and rich. I doubled the recipe, and baked it for about 30 minutes. It was a hit!

I had the same problem with the soupy in the middle for time alloted. Had to bake it another 10-15 minutes. That fixed the soupy problem. I will be making it for our holiday recipe party. Easy to do!

I had a problem with the recipe although it is very tasty. 325 degrees for 25 minutes and it was still soup in the middle. I used the 8X8 pan as suggested. Any help is appreciated.

This was so incredibly easy, and my husband, a non-dessert person, polished it off in no time! Very delicious!! Have made this many times and it always comes out great.
