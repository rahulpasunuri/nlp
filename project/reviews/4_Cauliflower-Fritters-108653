I loved these but there are a few important things to know: Like other reviewers said, the batter is a bit bland for all the work it took to chop the herbs. When I do this again, I will only use maybe chives and parsley, and add siracha or something. They hardly take any oil to "fry" and taste much better without the extra oil. You can just use cooking spray. Yes, some fall apart, but there is SO much batter it doesnt matter. I used gluten-free flour and it worked fine. I used a little less than 2 tbls.

oh, and yes, you need to add more flour--like 3 times more flour.

Very light, yet tasty. The mint really brings the flavors to life. The salmon topping is fantastic!

I thought these were surprisingly bland, given all the herbs. Also had a hard time getting them to coalesce.

Hmmmm...is there a way to get the edges crispier, like potato pancakes? I'm going to try this again with a little more flour. Wonderful taste, though!

Great recipe for cauliflower. I tripled it to use up what I had and made the fritters bigger. Added a little garlic salt and topped with a dollop of sour cream. Yummy!

Excellent!! I made these larger and got about twenty-five fritters from the recipe. I found I couldn't make them too large or the weight of the cauliflower would cause the fritters to break up when they were handled. A 3" diameter was about perfect. These were served as part of my brunch menu. Everyone loved them! I really liked how easy these were to make, too. I cooked the cauliflower the day before. I began cooking the fritters a few minutes before guests were to arrive (cauliflower was brought to room temp first, as recipe suggested). The fritters kept well lined on a cookie sheet in a warm oven then transferred to a platter when ready to assemble and serve. I used light sour cream instead of creme fraiche. These were so very quick and easy to make! I definitely plan to make these again.

I made these larger, more as you would make potato pancakes. No salmon. Very tasty part of a veg. dinner.

I didn't have all the ingredients in my fridge, so I modified it by using dill instead of the other herbs and added lemon juice to the fritters as well. On top, I used fresh cream cheese, lox, dill, and capers. Delicious!
