This was not bad, but we learned that we are not fond of orange zest in savory dishes. My family thought that it would have been better without it. We might try it again without the zest, but will look for other recipes first.

This was quick, easy, and delicious. I substituted Venison cubed steaks for beef, and paired it with roasted asparagus, brown rice, and a Spanish Grenache. A definite keeper!

I found this recipe under slow-cook, which doesn't match the instructions. I braised it for about 2 hours because I had very tough meat. The flavours were excellent as is, I think the extra cooking time made the difference.

bland, bland, bland. my grandmother's method of salt, pepper and butter was more exciting.

I read the reviews for this recipe but tried it anyway since I have a ton of cube steaks in the freezer. Had to triple the recipe for a large family. I used orange juice and added fresh ginger for an extra kick. Found the flavor ok. Works well with buttered noodles as a side. The sauce needs to be thickened, though. Added cornstarch.

Flavor was ok, although not particularly orange flavored. My spouse thought it left the meat chewy, but liked the flavor ok. Fine use of cube steak if you have it, but don't buy it especially for this dish.

Quick, easy, and good (we used orange juice, like another reviewer suggested). Nothing we would serve to company, but when you are so sick of chicken and pasta that you want to scream, this is an excellent alternative. We'll add more onions next time.

Great recipe for cube steaks! Makes them better than oridinary cube steaks. The only thing I might would add is a little more orange zest or add a tablespoon of fresh squeezed orange juice to add more flavor. Positively a do again recipe!

This is probably the best thing you can do for a cube steak. The sophisticated flavor does wonders for such a boring cut of meat. It was tasty and quick to fix.

Different and delicious for cube steak. I was tired of the same old way of cooking them. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Pretty interesting taste from this dish. I have made it numerous times and really enjoy the citrus flavor with the tender cube steak. Certainly not a show stopper, but it is excellent for a quick dinner.

Very Good. Next time I think I might try it with lemon zest in place of the orange.

Sorry folks, but if there was a no forks option this recipe would rate it. We don't like sweet meat and this fits that category (and I followed the recipe exactly.) My husband left the table and foraged for peanut butter. Quick and easy it is, but good? No way. In other words, to each his own and this ain't mine.

Made this for a few friends, and they liked it very much. Really easy to make, too, which helped given that I didn't have much time. Simple and tasty!

This recipe really surprised me -- I didn't think cube steak could be this good. The combination of orange zest and soy sauce combine to make a very good dish. We served it with the barley and mushroom side dish, which was an excellent pairing.
