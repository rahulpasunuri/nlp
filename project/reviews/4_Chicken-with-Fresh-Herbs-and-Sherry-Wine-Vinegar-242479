I made this without the vermouth and butter, for no particular reason other than laziness. It was still delicious. The fresh herbs really make it. I used what I had on hand - Thai basil, parsley, rosemary, oregano, chives.

I suppose I shouldn't review this because I changed the method somewhat, but for the sake of those who are looking for a good marinade, I will. I combined all of the ingredients (except the white wine/butter for the sauce) and left it overnight in the refrigerator. Then I broiled the chicken. The chicken was so delicious, moist and full of flavor. This is one of my go-to marinades for a weeknight meal.

I really enjoyed the light, fresh taste of the chicken. We wound up using parsley, thyme, and rosemary on the chicken, since we had some from our garden. It went really well with the grilled veggies we made--asparagus, zucchini, squash, and green beans. It really is quite good for a summer bbq, if you want to keep the meal light for the summer.

Loved this recipe! And it is really easy (but again yes the smoke). Used dried herbs (40% parsely, 40% oregano, 10% thyme, 10% dill) and added ~1/2 tsp crushed pepper for a bit of bite. Also subbed with sherry vs sherry vinegar. Had to broil for a bit longer than what was recommended. A major hit with the sigo, and will likely enter our rotation!

Maybe this is a whole different recipe created from the one listed here... I don't know, but it was amazing! I created a marinade from the olive oil, Dijon mustard, salt, herbs (parsley, rosemary, tarragon, chives, marjoram, thyme... I have a plentiful herb garden), cream sherry instead of sherry wine vinegar, and a splash of balsamic. Marinated the chicken for about an hour in that mixture. Shook off the marinade and grilled the chicken for 12 minutes (6 min each side). It was tender and juicy. Tossed mushrooms into a saute pan with some butter and parsley, then added the remaining marinade, vermouth and butter called for in the recipe. I let it reduce, adding a pinch of arrowroot to thicken. Put a nice portion of greens on a plate, sliced the chicken and put it on top of the greens, then added the sauce. WOW. This was amazing. If you like the flavor of fresh herbs as much as I do, you'll love it.

This wasn't *bad*, other than when the oil in the pan caught fire and all the smoke that poured out of the oven. But I can cope with that. It's just that it wasn't all that good either. It might be worth a shot on a BBQ (that is, outside) but even then, there are tastier things to do with chicken, many of them on this very site. On the bright side: not much work to make this dish at all. If you're not sure, give it a try. You'll have something edible in short time and can decide for yourself. But to me, it's a waste of good ingredients.

Foolproof crowd pleaser. I made this to the letter and it turned out very well wit rave reviews from everyone. I do not eat chicken myself so was especially pleased that I could pull it off. I agree with the reviewer who suggested that you remove the batteries from your smoke detector, there was a lot of smoke and drama, so try first before you make this one for your local dignitary/celebrity.

Tried this last night. Great taste, but appeared burnt. Next time will broil until brown and then bake on lower temp. Chicken turned out juicy and sauce was fantastic. May thicken it a little next time with flour. Would be good with mushrooms in the sauce, also. Definately a keeper!

PS-I also used a gourmet sherry vinegar (the only one I could find) which may have added to it being extra good.

I found this recipe to be so good it didn't even need the butter sauce at the end, which I made with white wine and found it didn't add much. I used rosemary, thyme, and tarragon. Really good, though I also had a problem with smoke pouring out of the oven.

Good recipe. I used white wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar since I was unable to find it in the grocery. The recipe turned out well without the sherry vinegar.

Excellent. I added garlic and cooked it a bit differently. I used a deeper dish, so the sauce covered more of the chicken, and after the chicken was cooked, I transferred the sauce to a pan with the butter and vermouth to cook on the stove top. It took about 2-3 times longer to cook (I just kept flipping the chicken to keep from burning). Both my husband and I loved it.

In doing the whole "one new recipe each day" thing, I chose this one for Tuesday night this week and was really quite impressed. Unfortunately, the local supermarket was out of fresh oregano, so I substituted something else I had laying around, but the meal still turned out great and had my apartment smelling like taragon for the next day or so. I also chose the white wine over the vermouth, but I'll be attempting it with the original recommendation again in the near future. Either way, it turned out excellent. The only problem I experienced with the dish was that cooking it took significantly longer than the instructions, but I'm thinking this might actually be a function of the stove I was using. All in all, this is a great dish. I'll totally be whipping this up to impress friends in the near future.

I just made this tonight and it was very delicious. The only problem I have is what results from broiling meat with an oil based marinade. I never did this before. Just a warning if you decide to make it, make sure the exhaust fan is on high, the windows are open wide and the battery is out of the smoke detector, with these instructions, there should be no problem. I would definitely make this again especially for invited guests! It's very easy and delicious!!

We made this last night and it was so easy and delicious. I marinated the chicken for an hour, which really added to the flavor. I used cream sherry instead of the sherry vinegar, we find anything with vinegar makes for a really bad taste, we always substitute with a wine or a rose and the flavor is great. My husband even ate the extra piece I was saving for lunch... It was great, I am thinking this would be nice for a dinner party.

This was good for a week night. It was also easy.
