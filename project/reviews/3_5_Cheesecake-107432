I didn't love it and prob won't make it again. It was just OK. I prefer Strawberry-Topped Cheesecake with Graham Cracker Crust Bon Appétit | January 1998

This recipe is complete trash. On removing the springform after cooling, the cake oozed out from under the crusty top. Do yourself a favor and find a cheesecake recipe that has proper bake times. Most other recipes call for reducing the oven temp and cooling the cake in the oven as it cools. Unfortunately, I don't have my usual cookbook and I should have taken the fact that this recipe lacks those directions as a warning. Yum, cheesecake pudding for Christmas...

This is my new "go-to" cheesecake recipe! I made it for a dinner party last night and got rave reviews. It makes such a tall cheesecake which makes for a wonderful presentation. The texture was described as a "cheesecake mousse". Very good!

Best cheesecake ever, but agreed on decreasing the sugar to 1 cup. Nice and creamy, light texture. Not dense and crumbly like some that I've had. Even better is when you make this with the pecan crust for the "Banana's Foster Cheesecake."

Fantastic cheesecake. Many who didn't like cheesecake couldn't stop complimenting me on it. I half the sugar and is just right for our taste. Very easy to make

A bit time consuming, but worth the effort. Did not find Orange Flower Water so used Orange Extract, diluted with water. Worked fine. The first person to taste the cake could tell the orange was in it! Only the second cheesecake I had tried to make and well pleased.

I've been making this cheesecake since it was published in 2002! I love it--light and airy, yet rich and creamy.

Too light, too airy for me. I suppose I'm the type that likes denser cakes - the flavor was average and the texture feathery - forgettable. It's definitely not a traditional cheesecake. Followed the recipe exactly, and can safely say, wouldn't make it again.

I thought this was a nice tasting recipe! Definatly not a classic cheesecake, but nice and airy. I piped some kiwi/lime dessert sauce over the top and it looked wonderful. I also made a graham cracker crust for it, and used hazelnut syrup instead of the almond extract. I will definately make this again. It set up quickly and held it's shape nicely! Wonderful

I recently moved to a new home and accidently misplaced this recipe. I was in an absolute panic aty the thought of not being able to make it for the holidays this year but thanks to this site, I have it again and will never lose it again. I make it once a year because it is rather labor intensive (at least for me anyway) and my family absolutely loves it. I don't even make anything else because nothing else is needed. I always serve a fruit compote to go on top but no one ever uses it. This cheesecake is the best ever. It is amazing and everyone that has ever had it at my house is stunned because it is so good and not like any other cheescake they have ever had. I think the reason some don't like it is because it is more like a cheese souffle than a cheesecake. If you are looking for dense, this is not your recipe. That is why I love it so much because of its light and fluffy texture and "to die for" flavor.

I liked the airier texture of this non-traditional cheesecake BUT, Im going to try making it again with just 6 eggs to see if it comes out just a touch denser. I recommend dropping the sugar to 1 cup. I also used 1/4 tsp. Orange extract instead of orange flower water. Overall, awesome cheesecake. The best part is the top because it browns beautifully and tastes like the top crust on Saralee poundcake.

The first time I made this was from the article in the magazine, but have made it several times since. Everyone who has ever eaten it says its the cheesecake to die for. I usually serve with berries and/or a berry sauce and thick farm cream on the side. Absolutely delicious.

Perhaps I'm too much of a traditionalist, but I didn't particularly care for this cheesecake. Everyone else I served it to enjoyed it though. Personally, I won't be making this again, but I will be passing the recipe on :)

This cheesecake was abosultely delicious. Light and fluffy, everyone loved it. Instead of 1.5 cups of sugar. I used 1 cup for the entire recipe and it made it light and sweet but not too sweet. Also, I used all organic ingredients -the organic butter and cream cheese made a big difference in the taste.

I made this cheesecake for a pregnant friend's baby shower at work, and the plate was actually licked. Great success it had! It's unbelievably light and airy... Definitely a cake I would make again.

This recipe is NOT a traditional New York cheesecake recipe, but it is, by far, the most delicate, crustless, lightly sweetened cheesecake you'll ever make. Subtle flavors (e.g., rose water or the orange-flower water) enhance its refined airiness - perfect for spring and summer. It is requested time and again by family and guests who have enjoyed it - in fact, it has become the only kind of cheesecake they eat.

This cheesecake came out light and creamy - delicious! Not an easy recipe, but worth the effort and time. It's the best cheesecake I've ever tasted- it's got an elegant citrus flavor and silky texture. My pan was 9-1/2 inches rather than 10 and it worked fine; I cooked it for about 70 minutes. Substituted Orange Flower Water with Orange Extract in half the measurement. I'll make this recipe again. Awesome!

This has the potential to be the best cheesecake I've ever had once I get the kinks ironed out for myself. This is NOT an easy recipe. I found it to be rather tricky. I baked it in a 9 inch springform pan, and that made the cake rise higher. That (I found out after the fact) required apx 15-20 min longer baking time. The cake came out looking great, but the center was not done and was runny. Still tasty, and the family ate around the perimeter, the part that was cooked, and it was AMAZING! Light, fluffy, more like a mousse or souffle than a traditional cheesecake. That said, if you like you cheesecake creamy and dense, you should skip this recipe (or try adding 1-2 more packages of cream cheese). Don't worry if you can't find the exotic flavoring. This super light cake will bring out the best of any flavoring you have, like lemon rind, orange rind, or liqueurs. Try this recipe, but allow yourself 1 or 2 tries before serving it to guests so you could iron out the kinks.

I got rave reviews with this one last Christmas! Will probably make it again this year. Couldn't find the orange flower water so I used vanilla extract. Was still great. And since it has no crust, it's great for people who are on gluten-free diets, like me! Though it is a little difficult to cut and serve, it is still delicious.

This is a great cheesecake recipe. I made it for a family gatering and everyone loved it. To the cook who hade problems with it falling apart, Cheesecakes should be a little jiggly in the center when they come out oven. It will set up. If you overbake, it will be too dry and fall apart.

This was delicious ! Because of sugar restrictions in the family, we prepare foods as low-carb as possible. I used 'Maltitol' (artifical sweetner) for the sugar. We had it plain, with fudge sauce( artifically sweetened, of course), with pureed raspberries & strawberries. Everyone loved it. It has a crumbly, creamy texture and is

I followed the recipe, step-by-step. In 45 minutes of baking I knew it was going to start to burn, but I left it in for 20 minutes more, because when I would shake the springform, i could see it was not cooked yet. I took it out of the oven, let it cool off, but when I opened the spring, Everything fell apart, and it splatered all over. This was my 2 time trying your recipes. I can tell you, it does not work, I am a great cook, and this has never happened to me before.I was very dissapointed and upset for the waste of my time and money. Sicerely Mrs.Jones

Carefull with the Crust. If the Crust brakes up, it may not look the best any more, but still tastes Great!

I made this cheesecake and everyone loved it! I didn't like the idea of having no crust, so I made it with a chocolate cookie crust. Very good!

The title of this recipe does not do this dessert justice. I would not have made this if I had not seen the magazine and knew if was a recipe from the Russian Tea Rooms. I thought it was very easy and took it to work. My co-workers gave me rave reviews, shook my hand and said homemade tastes so much better. I wasn't quite sure how to incorporate the cornflour and some pieces seemed crumblier than others. Does anyone have any advice?

This is the best baked cheesecake I've ever had - and my guests thought so, too. I added the cornstarch to the cream cheese mixture at the very end and baked for the full 65 minutes - it was no problem to cut at all. Didn't even need to heat the knife. Poured melted chocolate and toasted almonds on top - it was fabulous!

This is less rich, less dense, and more interesting than a traditional cheesecake. It will be pleasing to those who don't usually love cheesecake. Very delicious!

Beautifully light and fluffy, so light, as a bit of a problem to cut and serve, slightly sticky even with a hot, wet knife. I certainly missed the conventional bottom crust but the daintiness of this cheesecake is beyond compare. Terrific recipe and not at all difficult to make. An elegant dessert that people will rave about with each delightful bite!!

I skipped the orange flower water (not available at the grocery store) but the taste was still very good. The ingredient list included cornstarch but it was not in the instruction list. I left it out and the cake was light but fell apart a little too easily. I would make this cheesecake again.
