For a light dinner entre this was great. For two, I doubled the recipe and it was just enough. Also, instead of hard boiled egg, I crumbled three strips of bacon. Definitely a keeper that I will do again.

I "adapted" this recipie quite a bit by switching the tomato juice for Scottish ale and added more cheese ... and it was DELICIOUS! A very yummy wintertime meal.
