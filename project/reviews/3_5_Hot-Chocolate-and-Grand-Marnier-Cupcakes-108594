Wow! These are delicious! Chewy and flaky on the outside, moist and yummy on the inside, lovely all the way through. They go excellently with a bit of creme fraiche or clotted cream (or, you know, the sweetened whip cream that goes to the recipe). I've grown somehwat addicted to these, especially now that the weather is turning colder, and I've taken to making up big batches and freezing them in the same way cupcake batter can be frozen*. Once I've let them thaw, they bake up a treat and are just as tasty as if they'd been made fresh. I kind of expected flavorful little hockey pucks when I first tried this, actually, but they even rose properly! *Portion the batter into cupcake papers already set into cupcake tins, cover the tins and place them in the freezer. Once the 'molds' have frozen, remove them from the tins, place them in resealable freezer bags, and put them back in the freezer until you're ready to use them.

These were excellent! They were light and chocolaty, a perfect dessert for a hearty meal of Osso Buco. My daughers asked when I could make them again the next day! I had to bake them for about 9 minutes because they hadn't cracked yet at 7 min.

This tasted good, but it lacks the wow of other desserts. I probably baked it too long too - 7 minutes wasn't enough, 12 minutes gave me a cooked center.

Was a bit disappointed in how these turned out. I made them ahead of time,since they were to be featured on a cupcake tree for a wedding reception type party. Maybe that's what made them sort of blah, but I may try them again and serve 'day of' rather than waiting. Still, have other go to recipes that I like much better and will use instead. (guests seemed to like them tho, so maybe my expectations were just too high)

delicious! the recipe says 7 minutes but i had to bake them for 17 minutes to get a solid texture so that the cupcake wouldn't fall apart.

like mini lava cakes! I use frangelico rather then grand marnier.

absolutely fantastic!

These are amazing. I used triple sec instead of Grand Marnier, and the orange flavor wasn't very prominent, but aside from that, this was a perfect easy-but-impressive holiday dessert.

Delicious though I had to make some adjustments due to lack of G. Marnier. Subbed in some coffee and a touch of cinnamon. Gave them a Mexican chocolate spin. Very rich and tasty.

These were amazing! I baked them yesterday and halved the recipe since it was just a test but, yum, did I wish I had doubled it instead. I will be making them again tonight. I am not a big fan of cupcakes but these are like moist brownies in a cupcake shape - delish! I ran out of Grand Marnier so I subbed in Kahlua. I'm all about the chocolate anyway. I now have Grand Marnier again so I'll be using it this time. I also dusted the cupcakes with icing sugar as suggested elsewhere. They're great even on their own. I highly recommend this recipe!

Oh my gosh, I just made these for my boyfriend, exactly according to the recipe, and they are exceptional. They taste just like lightly spiked hot chocolate. As an added bonus, they look super cute when they come out of the oven because they spread the muffin paper out a bit.

This was easy, elegant, and delicious! I did not use the muffin papers, but lined the bottom of the cupcake tin with parchment. Once the cakes cooled a little they came right out. Dust with powdered sugar and they were a big hit. Will definitely make them again!

Add about a tablespoon of orange zest to enhace the orange flavor. I used egular triple sec instead of Grand Marnier. Perhaps that explains the weakness of the orange taste with the liqueur alone. Served with marzipan mushrooms on top and called it "dirt and mushrooms" (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/104508)

I thought the "cupcakes" turned out terrific. The texture was just dense enough, and unlike some of the other reviews, I thought there was a nice balance between the grand marnier & chocolate. I would suggest making them in a small ramiken instead of the cup cake tins.

This was great for a party as advertised, and deliciously rich but small, so not too heavy. The only thing is I wish the orange flavor had been a little stronger-- it tasted like straight chocolate to me. I will play with this recipe, but it is yummy as is.

This was terribly disappointing--small, bland, just blah. I'll stick to the molten chocolate cakes that are showstoppers every time.

Fantastic, and so easy!! A big hit by all accounts. I, too, used chambord and added some to the whipped cream. I'll definately make it again and experiment with various cordials.

Simply wonderful! I am a terrible baker, and yet these turned out fabulous! A miracle recipe!

So easy to make and it makes a great presentation! I made it for my parents and inlaws and they all loved it. My mother-in-law had seconds! This will be made many times again because you can make it ahead of time and just cook them off quickly at the end of dinner.

These cupcakes are like quick, individual souffles and best of all they can be made the night before and only need 7 minutes to bake! You have to serve them when they come out of the oven or they "deflate". They aren't meant for frosting. I serve them with ice cream on the side.

To cook from SFO. If you just put the paper liners on a cookie sheet they will spread. You need to put them in a muffin tin. Or find the cupcake liners that have a layer of foil on the outside and paper on the inside, and you can just put those on a cookie sheet.

I choose these cupcakes because they were the easiest. Bake in papers on cookie sheet. I did that. The papers spread, the cupcakes cracked and were impossible to spread with my marscapone, whipped cream frosting. Yes they tasted good but I would love to be able to serve them to company. They don't look the best. What's the best way to serve these delicious treats! Thanks

So easy and delicious. Good thing recipe made 12, everyone wanted seconds. I served it with a scoop of soft vanilla bean ice cream and an Epicurious Caramel-Chocolate sauce for all the chocoholics.

an easy, delicious, winning recipe! i substituted bailey's irish cream for the grand marnier, and the 15 people i served them to all raved. nice low-fuss recipe that i look forward to making again (and again...)

These were the perfect ending to a dinner with red wine lovers! The fact that they can be made the day before and cooked the night of a dinner party makes this recipe an easy one for the cook!

These cupcakes were incredibly easy to make, and very light. I used Chambord instead of Grand Marnier, and added a dash of Chambord to my whipped cream to top them off. I think next time I would throw in a little milk chocolate, but otherwise I wouldn't change them. These are not super chocolatey and rich, but a nice lighter dessert.
