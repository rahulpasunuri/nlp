Unless you use a yogurt with of 4% fat, or 2% fat, there is no fat in this recipe. Check the bottled syrup to make sure there is no fat in it, and you have a non fat food before you of delectable and nutritious substance.

An elegant and refreshing way to enjoy fruit and nuts every season! I keep jars of home-preserved fruit in my fridge and serve it over greek yogurt along with slightly toasted nuts every occasion I can. The almond syrup is a most elegant touch that binds the flavors! Served in crystal bowls gets ohs and ahs from the guests.
