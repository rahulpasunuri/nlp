Delicious! We made this w hazelnuts instead of walnuts and it was SO GOOD. Got raves for appearance and taste. The mint was lovely, and who could complain about cherries and hazels (lightly toasted) w perfectly cooked beans. This is a keeper fer sure!

Loved this! I did one bowl as written and another bowl with white balsamic and dried cranberries. I really liked them both, but the dried tart cherries were excellent. I think I will change the proportions a little to increase the cherries, slightly increase them mint, and decrease the salt and shallots a bit. It really was delicious, though! ]

Followed the recipe as-as and it went fast. A nice, quick dish to take to a party without lots of prep and worry. The vinaigrette could be tossed with lots of other veggies as well. Definitely will keep in my quick go-to pile.

Really liked the dried cherry vinagrette but found that it didn't meld well with the green beans. Maybe if the green beans were chopped into bite-sized pieces it would be better.

This was amazing. Simple to make but the flavors are so complex. I served it with Duck a l'Orange and the tartness of this dish balanced the sweetness of the duck. It was perfect!

Made this for Christmas dinner. Most of it can be done ahead. The cherry vinaigrette was very festive. The mint wsa a nice touch. It was a great accompaniment to my standing rib roast. I will definitely repeat this one.

I made this as part of my Christmas dinner. Everyone raved and was fighting over the leftovers. FANTASTIC salad and so easy to make ahead. This will be a staple in my arsenal of easy and tasty sides. DO NOT SKIP the ice bath for the green beans...this is crucial! Enjoy!

I thought this was a nice change from our usual green beans at Christmas and it was great that everything could be done in advance until mixing with the dressing. No one else at the tabled raved about it though

A delightful, unexpected dish that hit the mark on Christmas with our turkey. Beans are SO good when flash boiled and thrown into an ice bath. Vinegarette is tasty (make sure to use the fresh mint!) and walnuts add an awesome crunch. Overall taste is a B-, texture is an A, ease of preperation gets an A, expensiveness an A, and overall, the dish is an A-.

This was truly delicious and a big hit at Christmas dinner. People who typically hate vegetable dishes even remarked on how much they liked it. The only thing that was strange is that it seemed like the proportions were off for the vinaigrette. I made it once according to the exact instructions and it was really weird tasting so I threw it out. I made it again, without the shallots, according to how I typically make a vinaigrette and it was better (i.e. less salt, less vinegar, less sugar).

Who really likes green bean casserole? This was a perfect substitute on our Thanksgiving table. Quick blanch, quick toast on the nuts, quick vinaigrette, all done the day before and put together in a snap a few hours before we sat down to eat. My normally reasonably peaceful family was fighting over the leftovers :) Don't skip the fresh mint!

Wow! This is the perfect recipe for Thanksgiving. You can make it in advance, it is a nice healthy side in a meal filled with heavy starchy dishes and it is really flavorful! I will be making this all the time.

Very nice! I was a bit skeptical about replacing the old green bean casserole, but wanted something fresher and lighter. Didn't have sherry-wine or mint, used some Beaujolais with a dash of vinegar instead. I was afraid this might be a bit exotic for Thanksgiving, but it was perfect with the turkey.

I made this for thanksgiving - since the dreaded green bean casserole has been banned - and it was good, but I would work with the vinaigrette to lighten it up more next time. Maybe proportions were off, but a vinegar taste dominated, and that detracted. Otherwise yummy, and well-liked by the crowd.

Big hit at Thanksgiving! My 8-year old niece couldn't stop eating them. In my opinion, there was a bit too much dressing for the quantity of beans. The dressing makes this dish and and the chopped mint is key to its brightness. Tastes great even the next day after refrigeration.

This is an outstanding vinaigrette! I will put this on everything from green salad to chicken to a spoon right into my mouth.

Super tasty! The cherry and sherry vinegar were just the right amount of tang. I used thinly sliced shallots instead of minced. I wouldn't say it served 8 though. I made double the recipe for 8.

What a wonderful way to use fresh garden ingredients during the summer! We even used dried tart cherries from our tree, so delicious. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was a very nice, fresh, light dish. It blended interesting tastes & was simple to prepare. Quite a nice twist on the traditional concept of green beans. I used cranberries, too, & I can't really say that I'd go back to cherries.

Excellent! I added some cold chicken to the salad. Could not find dried tart cherries, so used dried sweet cherries.

I am all about easy and gourmet at this point in my life (living in Paris - who needs to cook?). I LOVED this recipe! I am not much of a haricot vert fan, so this dish was a real treat for me. Everyone loved the flavor and the color of the dish was pleasing to the eyes and palate. I am definitely making this a regular side dish in my home. p.s. I did substitute cranberries for cherries because we were out of cherries, and it was just right.

Delicious! So glad I went out on a limb and tried this new green side dish. Adding Feta or Gorgonzola adds another glorious layer to this easy dish.

My sister made this at my suggestion for Thanksgiving and it was sensational. She's not quite the gourmand so I was pleasantly surprised at how well it came out. She did substitute craisins for the cherries. I've asked her to bring it to another family get together this weekend.

This was delicious. I've made it twice - for Thanksgiving, and then again for Christmas. It is a wonderful do ahead dish, with beautiful festive colors. The leftovers are delicious, and become ever so slightly delicious.

Very good and tasty! I used cranraisins and pecans as substitutes. Can easily be made ahead and then toss with vingarette prior to serving.

Fantastic recipe. It was simple and convenient. I made it the day before which lead to some nice flavors in the vinaigrette and made Thanksgiving a bit easier to manage. I tossed in some blue cheese right before serving which added a nice bite.

Made this for Thanksgiving - prepared it exactly as instructed and it was quite the hit. At first I questioned the addition of the mint because I just didn't think it would really meld with the flavorings of shallots, olive oil, and everything else. But I went with it, and I'm really glad I did. These were, by far, the hit of the day. I loved the fact that they could be made the day before and that they didn't require either fridge space or oven space the day of our gathering.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I made it the night before and mixed everything together an hour before serving. Even my Aunt who normally hates green beans loved this recipe. Only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts, since I had them left over from the Pecan Pie I made. Overall, an very yummy dish that I plan on making again.

This was a very easy dish to make a day before a big meal. Cooked the green beans and made the dressing the day before and then mixed them together an hour before serving. Everyone in my family loved them, even my Aunt who normally hates green beans. I followed the recipe exactly and the only change I would make would be to chop the dried cherries into smaller pieces. Overall, an excellent dish that I plan to make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner for my family. None of us are big green bean fans, but I was looking for a veggie I could make ahead of time. It was a big hit with everyone. A very simple and attractive dish. I followed the recipe exactly except I chopped the dried cherries before adding to the dressing.

This was a gamble that paid off. Was not sure about the flavor combination when I first saw the recepie but wanted to do something different with the usual green bean side dish for Thanksgiving. Pleasantly surprised. This was a very tasty dish

Sorry, Diane, this was my first miss from epicurious.com and I've gotten a lot of recipes here. While I will say it was pretty, it just didn't taste good. The flavors didn't blend as I had hoped.

This is great! A nice change from green beans almondine. The vinaigrette is perfect. The dried cherries really work well with the beans, vinegar and nuts. I followed the recipe up until the sherry vinegar. I used white balsamic instead. Worked perfectly. I'll be making these over and over!

Great recipe! Made this recipe for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner. I used dried cranberries instead of cherries, but was able to get the rest of the ingredients from the supermarket. I did the vinaigrette the day before, but the beans that morning. It was a real hit - compliments from everyone who had some. Finished off the leftovers the next day and they were still delicious.

Loved this. Had to do some substitutions based on what was on hand, but nothing major -- dried mint (1/3 the amt) instead of fresh, toasted pecans instead of walnuts, craisins instead of cherries, rice vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. The best part was that all 3 components (beans, vinaigrette, nuts) could be done a day ahead and then tossed a few hours before. Three hrs seemed better than two -- longer, the beans will discolor. Since all my substitutions were so similar to the original ingredients, I do not imagine there was much change.
