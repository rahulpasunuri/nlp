YUM! I just whipped this up in NO time. Used pistachios instead of almonds as that was what I had, doubled it and likley used more cream than called for and it's really quite tasty! I can imagine this recipe being slightly tweaked to create candy. Can't wait to serve it to my gusts later tonight. My husband is already raving. I'll be serving it after a mediterranean lamb dinner. Mmmmmmm
