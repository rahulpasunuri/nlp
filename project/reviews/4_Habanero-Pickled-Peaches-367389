This is one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life! I've shared them with a number of my friends all of whom immediately ran out to get peaches to make their own. Eating them is like having a party break out in your mouth. Sweet, spicy, soft and cool, but yet so delightfully . . . peachy. A few slices of fresh ginger in each jar was the only addition I made. This will be an end of summer favorite for a long time to come.
