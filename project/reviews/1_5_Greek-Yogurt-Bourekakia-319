I have to be honest and say that I didn't even make this recipe. I lived in Greece and this isn't bourekakia.....bourekakia is a filled--and most often-fried pastry dough with cheese and meat. To die for, really....

I found this as described light and flaky, however it had no flavor. I can usually think of something to fix most recipies but I can't think of anything to make this more favorful!

I've lived in Greece for almost 20 years and to the best of my knowledge Bourekakia should be a "filled" pastry. All you need to do to make this recipe more authentic, is to fold the strips over and fill with the cheese mixture. This is similar to "tiropitas", or cheese pies. Would you like more authentic Greek recipts? Send me an e-mail and we can negotiate. Kali Orexi, Janet Hellis
