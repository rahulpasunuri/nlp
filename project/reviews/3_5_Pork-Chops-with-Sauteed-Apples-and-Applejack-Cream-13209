This was great! I gave it 3 forks because of the thin sauce. I would make a few changes in the future, but I am definitely making this again, for company! First, I would bake the apples separately with more spices, like cinnamon. (if you had a problem with the sauce thickening, it is because the apples add too much water to the sauce, and you have to reduce it forever) Then I would make the cream sauce with the applejack, wine and spices. I'll also broil a pork loin instead of chops. (I'll let you know how it turns out) I served this with Brussels Sprouts roasted with garlic and herbs de provence; they made a nice savory compliment to the sweetness of the main course. And a crusty baguette. My husband loved it.

Great recipe for entertaining. I used brandy rather than the applejack and it turned out great.

I agree with previous reviewers that a combo of cider vinegar and brandy replaces calvados if you don't have it. Also agree that apples should cook for less time than called for. 2-inch-thick pork chops had to cook about 12 minutes longer than the recipe said, and required more sauce.

Solid weeknight meal. I sliced the apples thinner than directed and that was a mistake-mushy to say the least. Used 1 TBSP cider and 1 TBSP brandy instead of the applejack. The sauce was still delicious and the kids loved the apples anyway. Next time I'll heed the advice of others and double the sauce.

This is unbelieveably delicious. I only cooked three porkchops as there were only three of us, and it was just enough sauce, so i would also increase if i were making more chops. It is so good, you want to make sure there is enough!

YUM! I made this for dinner with my in-laws, and made enough for two chops per person and the platter was clean before we left the table. I took the suggestion of others below and doubled the sauce, and let it reduce quite a bit while the chops were resting. Otherwise I made it exactly as-is. The sauce did separate a bit, so I may make some minor changes next time, but this will definitely become a regular meal in my house.

We *really* enjoyed this dish. Followed the recipe, but next time will cook the apples for a shorter duration as they were too soft for my liking.

My husband loved this...I did deglaze with 1 cup of apple cider and reduced it until it was a rich caramel color...and then finished the recipe as written. I did not have any Calvdos or Applejack, so I substituted this with Apple Schnapps. Any time there is a sauce, I find that I have to reduce it for a much longer time than the recipe calls for in order to thicken it. I reduced the sauce until it was a rich brown color (I also doubled the sauce and apples). This is a nice weeknight recipe that doesn't take long to prepare.

I followed the recipe as written with one exception--used half and half instead of heavy cream. The cream sauce was a disappointment. It did not thicken and therefore did not have much impact on flavor when served. Given the preponderance of good reviews, I'd like to try the recipe again. Any suggestions on getting the sauce to thicken?

This was a hit. I've never been much of a pork fan, but this was great and will definitely become a regular. I substituted apple cider for Calvados and port for white wine (which gave a deeper flavour). Made for a tasty and easy meal.

Great way to cook pork chops. I substituted hard apple cider for the apple jack, and it was delicious. Easy to make, too.

A favorite autumn dish. I substitute fatfree half and half for the cream, adding it last and cooking just until heated through so it does not become stringy or clump. Wonderful flavor.

I have been serving this to guests for some time now. Everyone loves it and I am always being asked for the recipe. I use the Golden Delicious Apples and I don't peel them. You can't miss with this recipe.

Yummy Yummy! I've made this dish a number of times since discovering it, and thought it was about time I give it the rating my family thinks it deserves. I've made no changes/substitutions to the original recipe.

This dish was very tasty. I added some sliced onions and thickened the sauce a bit with cornstarch. I served it with cornbread stuffing. My family really enjoyed the meal (including my sons, ages 7 and 11).

I've made this dish twice. The first time the sauce was thin. The second time I simmered longer and on slightly higher heat, stirring constantly. That fixed the problem. I love this dish - may actually make it again tonight now that I'm looking at the recipe. It's a snap and delicious.

This was a flavorful, easy and quick dish for dinner. With apple season here it was a perfect way to incorporate them into a nice dinner dish. It was perfect for the cold day outside. I did not have the Calvados so I substituted brandy and it turned out nice. I definitely will make this dish again.

To the previous posters w/ problems w/ the sauce - after the apples & chops are done , de-glaze w/ a cup or so of cider and reduce 75% ( till very dark ) , add a litle exta AJ , and bingo

Lots of great reviews? although good this was not real flavorful. I'm not even sure what it was missing. Maybe more Calvados? I doubled the sauce but the whole sauce recipe just seemed to be lacking in flavor.

Rating: 4
I think this is one of the best dishes I have ever made. I cleaned my plate and was even caught scooping up the leftover sauce in the pan with some extra apples. I am afraid to make this again because I know it will be a repeat diet offense!!! I didn't have all the ingredients: I used regular Christian Bros. brandy, and I was out of celery salt and sage. The lack of savory spices probably made mine a lot sweeter than normal, but I wouldn't change a thing. I reduced the sauce until it was VERY thick, it had tons of flavor. Now, I love sweet meals and I love eating fruit in my dinner. My boyfriend, on the other hand, does not. So I just served him plain ol' pork chops and some A-1. Yay, more for me! If you like dinners that remind you of dessert, you will love this. If you don't, then I wouldn't attempt this one.

First time I thought the recipe was simply good. Second time I used smoked chops and it came out awesome; it really enhanced the flavors. It's a matter of personal taste, but I recommend it.

I had some problems with the apples. I used golden delicious apples and they had too much water in them. The recipe called for cooking time of 13 minutes but I had to cook it much longer to get the desired effect. I substituted brandy for applejack and it turned out fine.

I made this for my husbnd and me using just two very thick pork chops, but the same amount of sauce called for. I cooked the sauce down without removing the pork chops, I just piled the apples on top of them and let it cook. It was delicious.

Rating: 3
This was good, but not great. I doubled the sauce recipe as suggested, but it required alot more cooking it down then the recipe reads in order to make it "sauce-like". It ended up being a bit runny. My guest liked it, but it was not one of my better presentations. I did add onion as well which is a nice complement to the apple.

When you need a great main dish in a pinch, this recipe will never let you down. It has become a staple in my home and I cook it at least once a month. Everything comes together well and needs little or no tweeking--in fact I've never had to tweek this recipe. It's great and simple to put together.

This is a great pork recipe! My husband loved it and he usually doesn't like cooked apples. I used pork chops with bone, but will use pork loin chops next time. I also added chopped sweet onion along with the apples. Very good.

This was an absolutely incredible meal. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and when I make it again, I'll probably triple it. It was beyond delicious. Even my vegetarian daughter who turns her nose in the air at meat, was enticed by the aroma to taste a small bite, and then sat down to join us and had seconds. A very impressive meal for company. I used thick boneless chops.

OH! MY! GOODNESS! Dinner was 1/2 hour late. Family said they would have waited until the next day for this. I had a fennel bulb to use up, so added that to the apples. I doubled the sauce & cooked thawed mushroom ravioli (bougnt at Sam's discount foodstore) in the sauce as it thickened. :)! Wonderful! To say the least!

My family loves this dish. It is very easy to prepare and gives great results every time. The meat is tender and tasty. The gravy is just the right consistency and complements many side dishes. It is simple enough to make even on a weekday evening, but tastes like you went though a lot of trouble. It is now a weekly or bi-weekly event at my house. BRAVO!

I made this sauce and paired it with a pork tenderloin. I served it with a simple risotto bianco for a dinner party for 8 and got rave reviews. It's very similar to a dish I had at a B&B in Normandy, France and have been craving ever since.

A unique taste sensation. My husband & I both enjoyed it. I used apple cider vinegar instead of applejack and rosemary instead of sage since I didn't have those ingredients. I also followed a previous review and used more apples. My 6 yr. old hated the taste, not good for kids.

I don't get it. I made this for company, based on the reviews (and followed directions precisely), and was incredibly disappointed. Very mediocre flavor, watery sauce (didn't thicken at all - it was like water). People were polite, but didn't compliment it at all. Am I missing something?

I love this combination of pork chops, apple and white wine; the flavors are a true compliment to one another. It is possible to make a scaled down version, that is also exceptionaly delicious. Brown chops sprinkled with seasoned salt, instead of celery salt. After browning, remove chops, add 1 medium chopped onion & 1 more Tab. butter, add chops back to pan and continue. The apple jack or Calvados is really a glorified option, just increase white wine to 1/2 cup. Heavy cream can also be omitted, if you are watching calories; but make them both ways and see if there is a difference. Most important, just enjoy.
