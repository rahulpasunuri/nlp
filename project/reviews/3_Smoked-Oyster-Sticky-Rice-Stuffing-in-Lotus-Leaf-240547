I'm making this for Thanksgiving this year. Can anyone tell me--instead of the pie plate and steamer basket...what if I use a large bamboo steamer, sans pie plate? Seems more of an authentic preparation but would surely produce a different steam.

Way too much effort for unbalanced flavor. I salvaged this by treating it as a risotto and avoiding the unnecessary steaming issue. I used vegetable stock for the risotto part and found it necessary to double the scallions and fresh ginger as well as adding a very healthy punch of red curry paste thined in low sodium soy. My version was great. Recipe was disappointing considering how much it was hyped in the Nov. Gourmet.

My family really like this dish. I'll make this wonderful dish again.

Very flavourful and quite impressive. I used bamboo leaves because I couldn't find lotus. I also laid out several leaves on the bottom of the steamer basket, placed the rice on top, and covered the rice with additional leaves. Yummy!

I had to traverse to china town in NYC to track down the sausage and lotus leafs, but I think it was worth it...This dish was made as part of an "international" thanksgiving feast for high school students along with the asian-accented turkey from this issue of Gourmet. Getting the kids to try it was kinda hard, but the ones that did said they enjoyed it...VERY filling, and you can't each much, but definately an interesting twist for thanksgiving.
