This recipe was great! They had Rosemary Olive Oil bread at the bakery so I used that instead of sourdough. Also followed the other reviewers advice and broiled the chops for 3 minutes on each side without the breadcrumbs, then added the breadcrumbs and broiled for 3 minutes. This was the first time I made lamb at home and it was absolutely fool-proof and delicious!

This was a very tasty dish! Although I only marinated the chops for 3 hours versus the time frame the recipe called for, I was still impressed with the results. If mint sauce and lamb is not your thing, this is a great alternative.

Excellent. The only thing that I changed was that I mixed the marinade in with the breadcrumbs instead of just the lemon juice.

Like Gracie add 1 tbls honey. Also, I personally prefer 'extra' light olive oil in this particular recipie - however, no matter what - I've made it so many times and it is wonderful. Grill/Bake/Broil to your liking, not necessarily the recipie instructions.

This was great! Instead of breadcrumbs, we used crushed pistachios as the crust.

I didn't have time to marinate it for long, but it still retained a great garlicky-lemon taste. And the crunchiness of the bread crumbs finished it off well.

This recipe was a big hit. I found it very easy to prepare. Heeding the warnings about the burnt breadcrumbs, I changed the broiling time to 3 minutes on each side, then topped with the breadcrumbs and finished broiling only 2 minutes. Let the chops rest a few minutes before serving. Yum!

I also had trouble with burning the bread crumbs, but it was still delicious!

We loved this lamb dish. I made a couple of changes. I added one tbl honey to the marinade. I drained the marinade off and rolled the medallions in seasoned breadcrumbs and flour. I then sauteed these in a frypan with some good olive oil. Set the meat aside and I made a sauce/gravy from a rich lamb stock (roast the lamb bones, add beef boullion,red or white wine, rosemary, garlic and salt and simmer for one hour and strain the stock) added a little flour, rosemary salt and pepper and served over the lamb. It was wonderful.

This dish is very tasty, and quite easy too. The marinade adds a wonderful flavor. In the future, I may not even add the bread crumbs, and just let the marinade do its work. Had a little problem with the broiler....maybe will try grilling next time, or pan-searing and then baking. The breadcrumbs browned too quickly under the broiler, even after repositioning the racks. Still, the flavor and ease of preparation was well worth the broiling fiasco.
