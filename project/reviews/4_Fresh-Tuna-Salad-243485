Made great sandwiches with grilled sourdough and sharp cheddar. Added some balsalmic and arugula, it was great

Delicious recipe. The only thing I'd add would be a touch of mustard for taste. Does anyone know how long it lasts? I want sandwiches for the office.

Tasty, light, and simply delicious! I'm not a fan of heavy & over mayo'd salads so I used mayo with olive oil by Kraft as an alternative to making my own mayo. I used less scallions than what it called for but I don't recommend leaving the scallions out ... it really added flavor!

This was an amazingly tasty salad for all its simplicity. I used really good ahi tuna, one whole apple, and added lemon juice. Wonderful and so easy.
