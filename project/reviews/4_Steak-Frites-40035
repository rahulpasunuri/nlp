Unfortunately the steaks mentioned in this recipe are all wrong. Steak frites is made from a cheap cut of meat usually hangar which is not readily available in your local blandchoice-mart

If you don't want to , or can't use a grill , this is a good way to prepare rib eyes. I cut down the amount of butter and subbed cabernet for water. Time stated seemed a bit too long for me but that is a matter of choice.

Wow! I aspire to be a great cook, but I usually fall very short. Tonight was different - I followed the directions on how to cook the steak (I used the package of fresh filet mignon that is sold at Costco)....and voila, perfect steaks! The steaks are pretty thick, so I did them for 8 minutes, and they were perfect medium rare. My kids loved them! Kathy

I over cooked the steaks (they were small) by a few minutes, but they were still very good. deglazed with red wine and used lots less buttter. this would be a really good meal for a weeknight date or someone else you want to impress with your cooking skills.

Excellent! My husband said it's the best steak he's ever had...and he's had a lot of steak! My kids thought the fries were better than MCDonalds AND Burger King--high praise indeed from a 3 and 5 yr old!

I'm a novice cook and and found this to be a quick, easy and delicious recipe. I was nervous that I was going to over-cook the $teaks, so I ended up going by the cooking time (8 min.) rather than waiting for the blood to come to the surface. I was happy to see that they still turned out nicely. Thanks for the recipe and sorry to see I missed 'Sara's' notorious review!

Enjoyed this the first time we made it. LOVED it last night when we substituted red wine for the water. Great when you need a fast meal! Faster (and better )than running out for take-out!

I had some LOVELY rib steaks, and less than 1/2 hour prep time. I only used half the butter at the end, but otherwise prepared the recipe as written. What a terrific dish! My daughter proclaimed the fries "WAY better than McDonald's" and had seconds on the medium rare steak. We will have this again soon, maybe a bit more rare.

this was so good! i was also a bit worried about having a bland gravy, but the steak juices, butter and seasoning was sensational. we sopped up the last drops with the lovely fries! i gave the steaks just 3 minutes on each side, though, and it came out well-done. i love a juicy medium rare steak, so i'll just adjust next time.

Simple as can be, and delicious, with or without the fries. The initial searing is important for the formation of the crust. A steak-lover's dream.

Oh my goodness, this is a PHEONOMENAL steak. I was so skeptical of the recipe's simplicity, but this has replaced our favorite steak recipe. The salt, pepper, butter makes a good and strong enough flavor, and the texture is amazing. Who doesn't love a nice crispy crust on a perfectly done steak?

Yum! What an excellent steak! Very flavorful. Mine didn't take near as long to cook as the recipe said it would. I also used less butter than called for.

WOW. Loved this, so simple, but so luxurious at the same time. And a note to Sara, you are a zipperhead. With any luck you'll come down with a scorching case of hemmoroids.

I liked this one, and will surely make it again. I however pan fry most of my steaks, I find it gives them great flavor. As an aside, I think Sara's been into the paint rags again! Bon Appetit to all!

This is an great recipe for steak-frites, especially considering it makes a great steak without a grill. I used a grill pan, reduced the amount of butter and it worked perfectly. The frites were brill. Made them with white creamery potatoes, the wedges turned out soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I'm planning to go to a local brewery to pick up a Belgian brew and make it again!

I made this tonight and enjoyed it. The steak was good, but too much butter - and I love butter. But I only made 2 steaks, not 4, so I should have cut the butter down. I made the frites in a deep fryer, generally following directions, but found that having the steaks and the frites come out together was too much for me, and I took the fries out too soon, so they were not as crispy they could have been. Next time. I'll cook the steaks half way (about 4 minutes) then put the fries in for the second fry. The steak was done perfectly for me (medium rare) using the method in the recipe.

Fabulous recipe--you gotta make the fries! Now, come on folks, just a few more reviews and we'll bump Sara off the site!

I'm Belgian. This recipe is fantastic - especially paired with 'The One & Only Truly Belgian Fries' and a beer! As for Sara's comment - "Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and consciencious stupidity." -Martin Luther King, Jr.

I don't understand what the the cook from Minnetonka and Washington D.C. are offended by. The recipe is great. The originator is simply proud of his/her origins and generous enough to share the recipe. I'm sure if the cooks from Minnetonka or Washington D.C. had a family recipe tasty enough to share, they would include their opinions as well.

Very good and fattening. I used pork steaks which my family loves and it was just as good. I will make again.

Easy and great for the apartment with no outdoor grill! I added some Boursin herb spread to the pan during deglazing. Gave the meat an extra garlicky zip!

This is a wonderful quick dinner to prepare when your BBQ is out of commission due to rain. We had 2 rib steaks defrosted and no way to BBQ during a thunderstorm. I got online and found this recipe. What a treat....fattening but good! I served the steaks with homemade fries; hubby loved it and so did I.
