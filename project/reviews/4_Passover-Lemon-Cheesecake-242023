The cake looked beautiful, just like on the picture of the recipe. Unfortunately, taste and texture disappointed. Even though I used less sugar that the recipe recommended, the cake was still way too sweet. The base was completely flawed: I cooked it as per recipe, but its texture was a true reminder of the conditions in Egypt: it was so thick it could have served as mortar for those pyramids. We actually had to take out our chainsaw to cut through it. My advice: use more almonds instead of matzoh meal for the base and much less sugar in both base and filling.

For some reason my crust sort of melted and slid down the sides of the springform pan while I was baking it initially. I think it's definitely salvagable, but I'm wondering what I did wrong. Any ideas? My plan is to just have the cheesecake go above the level of the crust... we'll see if that works...

Everyone loved this! A newbie to cheesecake, I found the recipe easy to follow and the results delicious. Creamy, zesty - perfect!

made this last year for Passover - a BIG hit. I decorated the top (which cracked a bit) with candied rose petals and candied lemon & orange peels.

I used the crust recipe and it worked well but still tasted a bit matzoh mealy so next time I might try a combination of caster sugar, egg white and ground almonds instead. I 'cheated' with the filling as I'd just made a fresh batch of lemon curd and so simply whisked that into the cream cheese instead of following the recipe. It made it a doddle and worked well as I wanted a definitely lemony flavour, rather than just a hint. It got great reviews and was a really nice change after a milchig seder.

Second year making this for our Passover-LITE feast. Loved it! I recommend doubling the zest in the batter. It adds more lemon tones. Serve with berries and a nice muscato and you have heavenly perfection. The almond meal crust is fantastic. I even added 1 tsp of lemon zest into the crust which also added to the citrus tones. AMEN!

Made this for Passover and it was fabulous. Everyone was raving about it and when a chunk of the crust fell onto the table, my brother-in-law offered to eat it off the tablecloth! I candied the julienne lemon peel earlier in the day and used that as my garnish instead, which gave my cheesecake a very dramatic appearance and turned out to be quite the topic of conversation at the table.

Made this for Easter brunch and it was a huge hit. I topped it with fresh blackberries, raspberries, and sliced strawberries with some homemade whipped cream. Mmmmm, yummy! Next time I would decrease the sugar in the crust to 1/2 c. And I would follow others' recommendations on being gentle with the crust when you are putting in pan otherwise it may come out too hard. I didn't have too much of a problem though except around the outer bottom edges. The crust was so tasty. I would also double the lemon zest for more lemon flavor and squeeze juice from half of the lemon.

Has anyone made this cheesecake without the crust?

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this crust is. I am only rating the crust because I used a different filling. Also, for those who found the crust tough, I'd recommend patting it into the pan more gently. I tend to press it in too hard which makes a tougher crust and have been reminding myself to press more softly since that seems to help.

Was hosting a young Jewish man and his friend at our Easter dinner and made this recipe for dessert. My local store did not have any matzo meal so I improvised by pulverizing sheets of unsalted matzo crackers and using them in place of the meal and in place of the balnched almonds. Cheese cake was easy to make and delicious. I made it the day before which saved time the dayof the dinner! Served it with creme fraiche and sliced strawberries and whole blackberries sweetened with a little Citronage--an orange liquor! Yummmm!

This was my first cheesecake ever, let alone for Passover. The directions were easy and it came out perfect as promised. I chose it because the notes said it could be made in advance. Two days later it was indeed delicious, even after a 2 hour car ride! I substituted bottled (!) minced orange peel zest for the lemon zest and a raspberry sauce instead of the julienned lemon peel. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I do not own a springform pan but the cheese cake notes elsewhere on the site assured me that I could use a regular 9 inch cake pan in a water bath. It worked!! I would make this again and again.

I'm truly puzzled by the previous reviewer who found the proportions wrong. Neither I nor the other reviewers had that problem. My crust was about 1/4" and tasted like a delicious almond cookie (no problem cutting through it, either) and filling light, fluffy and 1-1/2" high. I would make this again not only for Passover, but as a year-round go-to cheesecake.

The proportions in this recipe aren't right. I followed the recipe precisely, yet the crust was thicker than the layer of cheese. In fact, the layer of cheese was about half an inch high, if that. I also felt that the recommended amount of sugar was too high and the cake tasted too sweet. I wouldn't follow this recipe again...

Vanilla extract is not kosher for passover. I substitute vanilla bean - open the bean and scrape the seeds into the batter.

Amazing! This was a hit for our Passover LITE dinner. We had a mix of religious backgrounds and ages ranging from ages 50 to 2, and everyone devoured it. I cheated a bit and used almond meal from blanched almonds and didn't even toast it. The crust was still incredible. Next time I'll toast the almond meal. Note I didn't see a size of springform. Since I was serving 25 I used a 10" and added 1/3 more of the recipe. It was a perfect amt. I would imagine the normal full recipe would be great for a 9" springform. Baked it for exactly 50 and it was perfectly set. Use Meyer lemon peel, I squeezed about 2 TBSP of lemon juice in the batter. YUM! Serve with simple fresh berries.

To encourage any other cooks seeking new Passover dessert recipes, I'm going out on a limb here to post a 4-star review before even serving this lovely Passover cheesecake, which I just put in the fridge to chill until Monday night. I know from tasting the crust mixture and the filling prior to baking that this is going to be a winner. Was at first skeptical about the high amount of butter in the crust, and the instructions to remove the sides of the pan while the cheesecake was still hot. But following the directions to a tee, the crust absorbed the butter beautifully, with no drips, and the sides of the pan came off like buttah! Can't wait to serve this on our Seder dessert table. Happy Pesach, everyone.

My friend had bought a graham cracker crust from the supermarket and asked me to find a cheesecake recipe for it. I wanted something easy that didn't require sour cream or heavy cream, as we didn't have any. This was perfect! Really easy, and only required a few ingredients, all of which we had in the house. It turned out great. We served it with the "Strawberry Sauce" recipe that we also found on this site. Highly recommended for a simple and delicious dessert.

WOW. The crust was amazing. I found a pack of ground almonds in the kosher passover section. Made the crust preparation a breeze. I used a different filling recipe...but added the lemon zest as suggested here. The whole cheesecake was delicious...especially the tasty crunchy crust.

This is a wonderful cheesecake. Because my brother-in-law is allergic to nuts, I didn't use almonds in the crust this year. Instead, I substituted plain matzo meal for the nuts and added about one quarter teaspoon cinnamon to the mixture. It was delicious and much more tender than the almond and cake meal crust recipe, which I have made before. Next time, I'll try all matzo meal, which has the same texture as graham cracker crumbs, adding more cinnamon.

This cheesecake was delicious, I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe. Everyone at my Passover Seder was raving about it...some even said they preferred this crust to the traditional cheesecake crust. It tastes even better the second day, so I wouldn't hesitate to make it a day or two in advance next time. It is one of the better kosher for Passover desserts I have made.

This recipe looks WONDERFUL. Can't wait to try it!! And sorry to inform "A Cook", but some people don't like to eat meat for the entire week of passover...so if you are observant and don't mix milk and meat at meals, you can have a fish or dairy meal and make cheesecake for dessert!

If you really observe Passover, you would not serve anything with butter or cream cheese after a meal with meat. Even if you aren't Kosher, most people try to observe for the meal.

I printed this recipe because I needed a Passover-friendly crust for another pie I planned to bake. With the leftover crust, I made four individual-sized lemon cheesecakes. They were delicious! I found the crust a little sweet and would probably use only 2/3 of the sugar next time, but I'll definitely make this for Passover next year.

This was awesome. My 4 year-old granddaughter helped make it and did a darn good job. She patted the crust, cracked the eggs, etc. I can hardly wait to make this recipe again and again. It was such a refreshing dessert after a heavy meal.

Simple recipe that yields a delicious, creamy cheesecake that is not too sweet. The crust was yummy; although, it was tough to cut through it. My family really enjoyed this cake for Passover. I would definitely make it again and also use the crust recipe for other Passover desserts.

great easy recipe. lowered the fat content by using two low fat cream cheese and one non fat cream cheese to it instead of full fat. would add more lemon zest next time. added rasberries on top.

So easy, so delicious and looks beautiful. As with other commenters, I also found the matzo crust a little tough, but there is so little crust that it hardly mattered. The filling is light and creamy, a nice counterpoint to the traditional heavy Passover meal. I made it with reduced fat cream cheese and extra lemon zest.

This is such a good cheesecake that no one believes it's for passover! It's just as good all year round with regular flour.

I made the crust with graham crackers and it was great. The filling is wonderful, not heavy like a lot of cheesecakes. I did add more lemon zest to jazz it up. Served it with defrosted blue berries for Hannukah. Everyone loved it. A great quick and easy cheesecake.

My husband said how he preferred this base to my usual biscuit base and could I use it all the year round. The actually cake was superb and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again.

My daughter made this and our family and guests loved the crust equally as much as the filling. I was wondering when she made it if the crust had too much butter or should be put into a larger springform. I told her to make sure that the almonds and matzah meal was finely ground knowing that matzah crusts can be tempermental.

Baked this the morning of the Passover seder. The lemon filling was delish, flavorful and creamy. But the crust was a little tough (hard). If anyone can suggest a way to tenderize the crust, I will make this again. The following day, we ate the leftovers and the filling was improved, but the crust was even harder. ON Passover, we served it with a scoop of raspberry sorbet topped with a few drops of rose water. Everyone at Passover loved the cheesecake. Have to find a way to fix this crust ....

Although I substituted pulverized matzo for the matzo meal, I believe the results were the same: a delicious cheesecake that was not a compromise as so many Passover desserts tend to be. The crust was exceptionally crisp, the filling creamy and flavorful.

This completely negates the idea of a "passover" cheesecake but I found the matza meal too startling and it didn't bow to the background as a crust ought, when it was time for my taste buds to concentrate on the lemon. Wow, that's a little lofty, I simply found the crust was a little incompatible for the filling. LOVED the almond flavor.

I can't comment on the filling, I used a Cook's Illustrated recipe. However, the crust is fantastic! Nutty, but not at all greasy. If you are looking for a matzo crust, try this one!
