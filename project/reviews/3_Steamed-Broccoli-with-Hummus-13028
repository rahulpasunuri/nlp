Ilike it enough to make it again, but it is too bland for me. I am thinking of roasting garlic and adding that.

I thought this was a nice recipe, something different. I love broccoli, so I'm usually up for a new broccoli dish. I got a bag of garbanzos and cookes them myself instead of using canned. And I also used less of the fats. Turned out great!

How can you rate the recipe when you didn't even make it?!?!?!?!?!

I confess I did use store-bought hummus to save time, but the concept isn't bad. I never would have imagined pairing hummus and broccoli. It makes a nice side dish with a middle eastern style chicken and couscous.

I did use a little more garlic and lemon juice. I think the combo with steamed broccoli was very tasty.

I don't necessarily agree with the choice of steamed broccoli, but the Hummus was very good. I recommend more garlic and more lemon juice however.
