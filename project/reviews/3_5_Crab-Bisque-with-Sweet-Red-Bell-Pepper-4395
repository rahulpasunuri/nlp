I thought this recipe was great...I lightened it up a little by using light cream only at the very end and not cooking it further. Looking forward to the leftovers!

Excellent Recipe, with a few changes, I pureed the soup before adding the crab, then cooked it down a bit (several hours) then I added chunk crab claw and the cream. Super delicious. I make this every fall and my family (and co-workers) love it!!

First of all, this recipe makes a lot of soup. I actually enjoy spicy food, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. I cooked this rather slowly, an hour one day, and then the next day I added the cream and cooked for another hour or so. I wanted to reduce and create a thicker soup. I did not add the crab to the soup as directed, but placed the soup in a bowl and then added about five tablespoons of lump crab to the center of the soup, then sprinkled the soup with green onions. It made for a very nice presentation.

Not a true bisque, but makes for a scrumptious chowder, especially if you're fortunate enough to boil fresh dungeness in seawater and use 2 cups of the boil water in place of the clam juice.

Loved this. My food processor sprung a leak when I tried to puree, so we went with the chowder-y texture, which was fine. My guests on election night LOVED it. I'll definitely make it again. ( I followed it exactly, except I only had half the clam juice called for. I also used fresh crab meat. Pricey, but worth it to me.)

Very easy and very tasty. I went easy on the cayenne pepper as advised in a previous review and was happy with the result. I also used fresh tarragon and added extra cream to thicken.

This is not a crab bisque with red bell pepper. This is a tomato soup with crab.

This is a great soup. If you puree' it in the blender it's even better

Tried this a couple of nights ago. It was nice but not special, probably wouldn't make again. Followed recipe exactly but decided it was better pureed before adding crab.

Would be great in a bread bowl! We didn't use as much cayenne as it called for (halving it still gives good flavor). It's definitely stewlike if you keep the veggies whole.

Go easy on the cayenne. It can overtake the flavor if you are not careful. I pureed before adding the crab. Delicious.

This is delicious, and an economical way to use crab for a big impact. Made this for New Year's Day dinner and am delighted with it. Would use this bisque in my most elegant party menu....tonight I'm serving it to my husband and 5 year old. I made it pretty much as written.

Fabulous recipe. The Terragon definately blends well with the Cayenne pepper to deliver a tangy and flavorful soup.

As this is a bisque, I felt there was a step missing so I tweaked it. After simmering the veggies down in the tomato, broth & wine, strain it through a sieve and puree the solids in a food processor. Then add the mixture back into the broth & proceed as directed. Absolute Heaven! This is one of my favorites, now & for years to come!

Delicious - Agree with others that it is more like a chowder. Added sauted mushrooms before serving.

Watch out for the celery with this one. The first night we ate it, it tasted overwhelmingly of celery. The next night, the flavors had blended and it was much better. Not a bad recipe, but I'm not sure it was worth the $15 in crab meat. (I used 16 oz, since that's what the container held. Probably a good idea, otherwise I think it would have been overwhelmed by the vegs.) I, too, used my immersion blender to emulsify the veg base before adding the crab meat. I added additional cream, plus a healthy dose of brandy. If I make it again, I'll tweak it and report the results.

I cut the recipe in half which worked quite well. I did add a bit more cream (I used light) and a few less tomatoes. Before adding the cream and crabmeat, I pureed the soup in a blender leaving a few chunks of veggies. I then returned it to the pot and finished. I topped it off with homemade croutons and it was a hit!

My wife loved everything about this recipe (and that means a lot since she is an Adkins junkie). The texture and color was awsome and adding a bit more cayenne "kicked it up a notch".

Try substituting a rich crab stock for the clam juice

Although it smelled wonderful while cooking and the colors were appealing, the flavor and texture of this "bisque" left me cold.(Bisque is a definite misnomer even after pureeing half the batch. I pureed half and left the other half "as is" for comparison.) I would definitely save my crabmeat for better uses. At the risk of sounding jingoistic, recipes from the East Coast and Southeast where crab season is a welcome part of the year(from Maryland Crabcakes to Key West Stone Crab Bisque) tend to be better.

This recipe is very good as it is, but I added one package of Knorr's Parma Rosa, and it was fantastic! This is now my favorite dish.

Like almost all other reviewers, I pureed the mixture, but I did it after I added the crab meat. Something about the flavor just didn't work for me. It could have been because the crab meat had been previously frozen. I'm going to try canned crab next time - it would certainly be less expensive!

I followed the recipe exactly except I added 14 ounces of crab instead of 12. I like my soups a little more chunky and was quiet happy that the difference in crab didn't kill the overall taste. I will make this again!

Like others, I puree before adding the crab meat. Also, since crab meat runs as much as $25/lb here in the Southwest, try using a mix of crab and diced large (31/40)shrimp. Recipe is very sensitive to the amount of cayenne. I use 50% more and add a little more cream.

I made this dish as a starter to our meal. I was not sure what I was making for sure but as soon as I tasted it I knew it was the right choice. It was wonderful, all parts of it were great. The color,taste,the feeling of it in your mouth. It has just enough kick in it. It was perfect! I will make this again, but this time I will share it with others so thay can enjoy it as well.

Since this is called a bisque, we thought it would be creamier, but even after putting it through the Cuisinart it still had too much texture for our liking. Needed more white white for flavor. Not worth the effort or expense.

Easy to make, but a little bland for me. I still liked it and will probably make it again.

I made this for New Year's Eve dinner and it was a smashing success. I followed others comments, however, and added half the crab and pureed before adding cream to make it a bit smoother. Next time I'll put it through a sieve as well. Also added a bit of brandy at the end which made it fantastic.

I made this for my family over Thanksgiving. It was a big hit. My mother and I decided to puree the soup before adding the crab which worked out really well. We love it durng crab season.

I first made this for Christmas Eve 1999 and my family loves it! I puree the soup before adding the crab so that the only chunks are the crab. It's wonderful!

I prefer "creamy" soups, especially with delicate seafood like crab. After adding the wine, I also wrapped the crab shells in cheese cloth and tied the cloth with string. I boiled the shells with the broth. After adding the cream, I pureed the soup, then added the crab. Wow. Fantastic.

My husband made this as a starter for our Christmas dinner. It was delicious. I just served the leftovers but pureed the soup and added a touch more cream. It is greatly improved. Next time we serve it we'll put the vegetable/cream mixture and 1/2 the crab through the food processor then add the remaining crab and heat, then serve. It is more bisque-like when pureed.

Delicious Bisque, although I cut the Cayenne to 1/8 and the tarragon to 1 1/2 tsp. Don't forget to pour a little Sherry into your bowl just before eating. The Sherry as restaurants add in, cut's through and smooths the taste.

I loved this and so did my husband - definitely a keeper for those approaching cold weather days.

I would make it again but not when I wanted a bisque. This was more like a crab chowder or stew than a bisque.

On Sunday nights during the winter months I always make a pot of soup to warm up my family. This one will be around for years to come. My husband couln't eat enough! I served it with toasted garlic baguettes and a mesculun salad! FABULOUS!

I agree with Sherry. It was tasty, guests loved but personally I didn't care for the texture- perhaps you need to turn up the heat more with the red pepper.

I had some leftover crab legs so I decided to try this. It is simple to prepare and absolutely delicious. A lot of chop-chop but with a glass of fine chardonnay in one hand task is pleasant enough. My guests could not get enough. Served with å huge salad of greens, feta cheese and homemade croutons with oil and rasberry salad dressing. And crusty french bread. Yum Yum.

Great receipe. Simple to fix and got rave reviews from my guests. I put the whole pound of (backfin) crabmeat in instead of the 12oz. called for in the receipe. Great with a simple salad, a good bread and desert. (I made Magic Cookie Bars_ butter, graham cracker crumbs, semi-sweet chocolate chips, coconut and nuts.) I'll definitely fix this again.
