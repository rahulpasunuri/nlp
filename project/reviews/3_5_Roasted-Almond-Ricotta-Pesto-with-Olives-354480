This recipe was very easy and quick. Very good for a mid-week meal. I used wonderful roasted and salted almonds and an extra garlic clove. I tossed it with ziti instead of spaghetti because that is what we had around the house. Serve with a big salad for a great and easy meal.

REALLY delicious. Believe it or not, even with the parmigiano and olives, it's not that salty. I added a little fleur de sel at serving. Also, I chopped half of the olives in the processor and half rough chopped. Will definitely make again.

I liked this a lot, but it's nothing out of this world. Just good comfort food. I do like the idea of using almonds in pesto, which is cheaper than pine nuts and tasted just as great.
