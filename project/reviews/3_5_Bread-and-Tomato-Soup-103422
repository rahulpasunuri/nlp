way too much bread flavor. I only substituted a yellow instead of a red onion. Seems a waste of my fresh tomatos.

A really good and easy tomato soup recipe. I put the garlic and basil into the saute, and used a really crisp baguette and it worked great. Something quick to do with extremely ripe tomatoes at the last minute.

This soup is excellent and so quick and easy. I added the garlic and basil right in with the tomatoes and onion and it gave so much more flavor. It's very tasty.

i made this for a lenten dinner, and it was only ok. i found it lacking in flavor. there are better tomato soup recipes out there.

This is a great soup! I'm no accomplished chef but this was easy and the result was so delicious. I used thick country garlic bread and plum tomatoes I skipped the sautee part because I'm allergic to onion; I simply threw the tomatoes and bread in with the broth and some crushed garlic, simmered, pureed, and added salt and pepper.

Great recipe; easy, delicious, healthy. Works great even with tinned tomatoes and white sliced bread! (Believe me, I wasn't going to try it, but ended up feeding a bunch of people unexpectedly when I had very little in the house...). Recently made a batch of 8 servings and froze the lot, which seems to be working so far...

I think this soup is great because it's delicious, easy and different. The second time I made this, I added Italian sausage (one link, skinned, sauted, crumbled).

With all the other rave reviews, I feel I did something wrong! Way too "bready" and garlic overpowered everything. Used thick, heavy white bread.....maybe should be lighter. I lost any interest in trying it again.

Holy Moley! This soup puts me in garlic-lover heaven! The garlic and basil (we use one and a half to two times what it calls for) are unique and perfectly harmonious with the soup when added fresh instead of cooked. I never would have thought of adding them that way. The soup itself is a strange color, but by adding a bit of garlic and basil on the top (or mixing the extras from the bottom before serving), the strange hue actually turns appealing. We make it again and again during long cold German winters. Yum!!

This recipe is wonderful. It has now become a favorite! Will make again and again!

The addition of the hot soup to bowls containing (a lot!) of basil and garlic is a master stroke. The flavours just leap out. Country bread does not come in a standard size and the porportion of bread to tomato would be clearer if expressed in cups of cubed bread.

Delicious! I had never made a bread and tomato soup before and I had my doubts, but it turned out great. And it was soo easy to make. I will definitely save this recipe!

This soup was perfect. Perfect substance, flavor, color and perfectly easy--it takes hardly any time at all!!! Didn't have fresh basil, just used dried basil plus fresh parsley and tops of green onions. Also included a bit of white balsamic vinegar and two pinches sugar. THEN I put in too much salt. Doh! So I countered with some heavy cream. Gee, can it get more perfect than this???

What a great soup -- one of the best I ever had. So delicious! It makes a LOT of soup. We quadrupled the recipe for to make it for 8 people, and we got about 16 good sized servings out of it, so a little goes a long way. We all loved it! Not hard to make either

The word tomato should not be included in the name of this soup. I thought it would be a chunky hearty soup, and rather it turned out to be fairly liquidy. So, my search for the perfect tomato soup continues....

fantastic! better than most bread & tomato soups served in restaurants. you can easily cut the oil to make this a lower fat dish. i used 1 1/2 Tbsp to saute the onions and i didn't drizzle any at the end.

Great! Like a Tuscan memory.
