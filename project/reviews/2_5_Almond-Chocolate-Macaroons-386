THE ORIGINAL RECIPE, AS PRINTED IN BON APPETIT, CALLED FOR 1 EGG WHITE, NOT 2. I'M SURE THAT THIS TYPO IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM WITH THE RECIPE.

Very chewy, rich and delicious! Plus a cinch to make! I used the ingredients exactly as listed (used Valrhona choc.). When it came time to add the egg white, I whipped it until fluffy first. Also, I used buttered parchment paper, let them cool completely on a rack, and they peeled off very easily. It's great to find such a yummy (and flourless!), easy recipe. Try it.

The end product was so runny. I did not notice the other cooks comment until after I had already put the cookies in the oven. I figured that I would just let them cook and take a chance. They were impossibly hard and had almost no almond taste to them even though they are made with all almonds.

I found that I needed almost another cup of almonds before the dough was of the right stiffness to form and bake. I also used a medley of semi-sweet, milk chocolate and white chocolate becasue I was running low on semi-sweet. (Also increased chocolate to one cup.) I didn't flatten them and they came out after about 18 minutes and were perfect and delicious --different from the recipe but still worth baking again.
