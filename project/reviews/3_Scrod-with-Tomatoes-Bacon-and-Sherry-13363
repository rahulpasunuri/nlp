Tasty and easy. This recipe would work with any mild flavored fish. Mediuum dry sherry (amontillado) is a bit sweet. I reccomend either fino or a fino/amontillado combination

I substituted chorizo for the bacon and used fresh plum tomatoes from my garden. This was a surprisingly attractive and delicious weekday meal that could easily impress company.

This was a bit disappointing. It was easy, but nothing special, and I thought the taste of the soy sauce was overpowering. The juxtaposition of soy sauce and sherry against tomatoes and bacon didn't work for my palate.

The sherry and tomatoes give this a zip that is often missing from Scrod. Don't be afraid to use more Sherry, it gives the end result more of a poached effect than a simmered. It will boil off nicely after the scrod is removed.

This was simple and delicious! I added about a teaspoon or so more bacon grease, and I will do that in the future. I served it with a green salad and orzo pasta tossed with a little olive oil, some Herbes de Provence, salt and pepper. Very easy!
