I love the combination of flavors but I was not a fan of the poached salmon. As other reviewers said, it didn't have enough flavor. Mine also came out a little watery. I would make this again -I loved the fennel, orange and mint but would maybe try roasting the salmon. Others liked the poaching though so it might just have been my technique!

Used fennel seed since we didn't have star anise handy - about 2T. Cooked the sliced fennel in the poaching liquid and reserved the liquid to poach the salmon. My father-in-law hates seafood and he loved it. Now its the only way he'll eat it! Healthy and tasty. My wife wants this dish on a weekly rotation.

Since I read the other reviews prior to making this, I doubled the anise stars in the poaching liquid. The first bite of the salmon was SO GOOD, but then the sweet anise flavor dissapated out quickly. So I continued boiling the poaching liquid to a 1/4 cup, let it cool, and poured it over the salmon and let it sit an hour or so, until we were ready to eat. WOW. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

Very good flavor combo, the mint definitely adds to the salad but as other reviewers mentioned, the poaching liquid doesn't do much for the fish...Added some lemon juice/salt/pepper to the salad as it was a little too bland for me. Would definitely make this again as part of a healthy meal.

What a special recipe! Everything was wonderful about it. Other reviewers stated that the mint was great, and it was. I was a little worried that the orange segments would be overpowering. Not so. I also adjusted the poaching liquid. I doubled the vinegar. Also added a good amount of sea salt and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. The knockout punch was the 3 tbsp of Pernod that I added to the poaching liquid. I figured that it would complement the anise in the fennel perfectly. The salmon ended up with a perfect balance of salty, sweet, and a wonderful perfume of Pernod. What a dish! Thinking of the wine pairing, we decided on a Riesling. Didn't want the oak of a chard. Sauv blanc would be too contradictory. Reds were out of the question. It was between a Viognier and Riesling.

The combination of mint, orange, fennel, and salmon was really delicious and even refreshing. I altered the recipe somewhat to make a slightly more substantial lunch entree salad for myself by adding about 85g baby spinach leaves. It was light, yet satisfying. For anyone who decides to try this recipe, I would recommend that although this may seem surprising, you can't add too much mint to the salad. You'll find yourself wanting more of that flavor as you eat the salad. The only reason I don't give this recipe four stars is that while the salmon itself was tasty, it didn't seem that the poaching liquid added any flavor to the fish, or if it did, it was very subtle. The METHOD of poaching, though, did make the fish a perfect texture for the salad. It would be worth experimenting with the poaching liquid to see how it might be possible to give it just a tad more anise flavor, or some other complementary flavor.

Easy to prepare, with lots of satisfying fresh crunchiness and an interesting mix of flavors. Very filling as well, due to all the fiber in the fennel. I agree the poaching liquid did not add any flavor; my husband thought the salmon itself was a little bland. I thought it was fine with salt and pepper to taste. I used wild salmon which I've found tends to be a little more firm and absorbs less water.

i just made this tonight and it was delicious. i added some arugula because i got it mixed up with another recipe in the same issue. one question. my poached salmon was a bit wet. moist and delicious, but a little wet which made for a sloppy presentation. anyone know how to avoid this? thanks!

really light and nice. needed a dash of chili oil, and i found that the poaching liquid didn't add all that much flavor so a little more vinegar or juice in the dressing helps. on the whole, deelish.

This is yummy!! I did not have enough mint, but think it would have been even better with the correct amount. This will be a new staple.
