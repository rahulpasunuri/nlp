I followed directions but mine turned out as soup. It's good on ice cream, but not really what I had in mind.

I have been making this for years and love it!! I always use good chocolate (though I admit to just using chocolate chips if it's just for the kids)but I mix it up a little. Try it with dark chocolate - use a little less than a pound or it will be too firm - with almonds and amaretto. Or milk chocolate with hazenuts and Frangelico. At christmas I use white chocolete and add crushed candy canes. Sometime I do it in a 9x13 pan and do a plain dark on the bottom and a batch of white with candycane on the top. The black and white looks awesome!

Made this last night and it came out great. For one thing, make sure to use high-quality chocolate; no, Tollhouse is not ok. I used Ghiradella chips; 11 oz of milk chocolate and 5 oz of semi-sweet 60%. I made a few modifications to the recipe, all to taste. I added: vanilla extract cayenne pepper medium sea salt a little caramel I am surprised to hear so many people say that they reduced the salt. I used medium ground sea salt and used quite a bit. I tend to like a higher salt content in my food and I felt like the salt really played off the chocolate and the bit of caramel I addded.

They were good, but they tasted a little strange: not quite like milk chocolate ought to taste. Maybe I didn't use high enough quality chocolate? I used Toll House milk chocolate chips, which isn't fabulous but has worked fine for all of the cooking I have done in the past.

Not really fudge. Very simple recipe with good flavor. I had no trouble at all, but it is not fudge. It tastes like a truffle bar or a thick candy bar. Nice, but not what I was hoping for. Neither the taste nor the texture turn out to be classic fudge.

This was the EASIEST fudge that I've ever made! I used 2 cups of milk chocolate chips, instead of a pound, and 1 cup of chopped nuts. It worked out well. I found that chilling it overnight, instead of just 4 hours, gave it a better overall texture.

I used Callebaut dark chocolate, and the flavor was terrific. My family loved it. However, it was a bit too gooey for my taste -- even after overnight refrigeration. Any suggestions to help with firming the fudge? If I could get it a little firmer I would give it 4 forks.

I only had salted butter, so I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. Way too salty. Other than that, great texture, which is 90% of the battle with fudge. Next time I will use salted butter and add a pinch of salt. Will probably try a semi-sweet chocolate as well.

Followed DMChef's advice and did not add butter or salt. Now I know why butter is used; my chocolate seized up while it was melting. Also, with just dark chocolate, the milk, and pecans, the fudge cooled to a hard brick. I might as well have been biting into the chocolate bar I used. Okay, that's not fudge. Fudge is supposed to be fudgy - it is soft on the teeth. Will try another recipe.

Really Good! You don't need as much salt as the recipe says but is still VERY good! I thought it was very easy. Used it for neighbor gifts and it was a big hit. I would make it again.

This is such a fabulous and easy recipe. I make it all the time to take out, and it continuously impresses everyone. I've found that I don't even need to add the butter or salt; use a dark chocolate instead and just add the milk. Perfect bliss.

Exceptionally Easy and Tasty. Made this over the holidays as well as a cooked fudge using a candy thermometer and this one is hands down much TASTIER and EASIER. Don't like milk chocolate; used bittersweet instead along with unsalted butter and just 1/2 tsp. of salt. Added toasted pecan pieces too. Yummy and a no brainer to boot!

I liked this, but felt the taste of the condensed milk was still too apparent, giving it an inauthentic feel to me.

Easy and delicious! I used semisweet chocolate and added a layer of crushed salty pretzels on top. A huge hit!

This was excellent. So easy! Turned out very smooth. Used Guittard milk chocolate chips. I used 1/2 tsp of salt and still felt it was a little salty. I didn't realize I used salted butter so I think I will omit the salt altogether next time. Making it again for Christmas!

Simple, easy, and the kids loved it. What else can I say?

Actually, this is an excellent fudge recipe. However, you do not need to add the butter and I would cut the salt down to just a pinch. Also, the trick to this fudge is to use a very good quality bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate. The sweetness of the condensed milk compensates for the the added sweetness and if you use milk chocolate, it will be too sweet.

Not that good. Really.
