Forgot to say I served the Orange Blueberry scones with Devonshire cream and sugarless blueberry jam.

I did a Orange Blueberry Scones using the zest and juice of an orange and swapped the cranberry for 1 cup of frozen blueberries. The orange juice end up being in addition to the milk and totals about 1 1/4 cup of liquid. Instead of 8 scones which would be very large, I made 3 small rounds with each round cut into 6 wedges so 18 scones.

I have used this recipe for years. I increase the sugar to 1/2 cup and use milk instead of buttermilk. Actually my daughter is a vegan, so I have used margarine and rice or soy milk too and these always turn out great! We also will change the recipe to cinnamon raisin by changing orange to a tsp of cinnamon & 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and use raisins instead of cranberries (or use just about any fruit-spice combination you like to basic recipe). Warning... Don't over work the dough or the scones will become stones.

Made these and a gluten free recipe found on the Happy tummy blog and both were equally delicious! These had a bit more butter (~4 Tbsp) and came out rich, dense and flakey. Perhaps there was a bit more orange zest (from an entire orange) in my version; also, my butter was not cut as finely so I noticed the butter was melting out of the scones once in the oven-- which ended up giving the tops & bottoms a nice golden hue. So incredible straight out of the oven! Will absolutely make again & pass the recipe onto friends. Yummo!

Just made these and I love this recipe. I made a few changes as I didn't have the same ingredients but it was still great. I used dried cherries, increased to 1C and lightly chopped. Also didn't have an orange or buttermilk so used lemon and skim milk-still turned out very tasty and maybe a little healthier. Also took the hint of grating the butter- I really found that faster. I cut into 16 instead of 8 and cooked for 21 minutes.

Forgot to mention that I followed previous reviewer comment and added a bit more orange rind, plus juice of one orange and adjusted the buttermilk for 1-14 c liquid total. I also substituted one cup of the white flour with whole wheat.

I made these for Mother's Day Brunch - but, I forgot to add the cranberries, so they were just Orange Scones. They were delicious - next time, I'll make sure to include the cranberries.

Made these for my wife for Mothers' Day today. Drizzled some orange glaze: about a half a cup of powdered sugar wisked together with 2-3 tbsp of fresh squeezed orange juice. She said they were the best scones she's ever had!!

Nice recipe, good proportions. The bottoms are prone to burn; time should be reduced and watch the sheets carefully. (This is unlike cream biscuits, which seem to cook more slowly, need higher heat). Try those insulated aluminum pans...terrible for cookies, they may be perfect for this scones.

I've never made scones before and my first attempt worked great!!! I followed the recommendation to grate the cold butter. I also wanted a real orange burst in flavour, so I added about one or two tablespoons of thawed unsweetened concentrated orange juice. A tiny sprinkle of sugar on the top just made them that much more special. I usually put lots of butter on my scones/tea biscuits, but these are so lovely on their own. I've already made them again and even did a batch "plain" batch with just raisins. Yum!

I've made these scones countless times and it's high time I wrote a review. The recipe is great, but I use the zest from a whole orange, and use the juice of that orange plus milk to make 1 1/4 cup instead of the cup of buttermilk called for in the recipe. I do everything else as set out in the recipe, including the cooking time, so it's interesting that a lot of other reviewers find that 25 minutes is too long. Best to watch I suppose. My main point is that I keep making these scones because people LOVE them. Always a hit and, as noted by most but not all reviewers, the recipe seems foolproof. It always turns out great for me.

Rating: 4
best cran orange scones I've made, and I've tried many recipes. I did, however, add the zest of a whole orange, and I think even more would be good. And I increased the cranberries to 1 cup which I think is perfect. Also, an orange glaze would make these over the top delicious!

Rating: 4
Easy, delicious, and forgiving recipe. I'd never made scones before and took a tip from some scone aficianados at the office who recommended grating the cold butter into the dry mixture and mixing it up by hand, which only took 2-3 mins and was easy peasy. Very yum and very recommended. Looking forward to trying some of the variations recommended by other reviewers.

These scones are some of my favorite. I made them for mother's day, but barely got my boyfriend to save any for anyone else! They were light and flaky and just the right amount of sweet. The only change I made was instead of buttermilk (couldn't find any) I mixed almost a cup of milk with 2 TBSP fresh orange juice, which gave them an extra orangey boost. Yum! Highly recommend.

Excellent scone recipe. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1/3 cup plain greek yogurt and 2/3 cream with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, then followed recipe exactly. This is a perfect go-to scone recipe.Made 8 large scones. Also, I made a batch of ginger lemon scones. Came out perfectly too. Going to make blueberry lemon today.

Best. scones. ever. Modifications: I used 1/4 cup dried buttermilk powder (I always have it in the fridge) to the sifted dry ingredients and one cup water when it says to add buttermilk. I used fresh cranberries instead of dried as we can always get super fresh and delicious cranberries in New England in the autumn. I added an extra teaspoon of sugar because of the fresh cranberries. I subbed 1 c. whole wheat flour for 1 c. of the white flour. Finally, I added some cinnamon and some mace. AWESOME.

these scones are fabulous. i believe the recipe is the same as the recipe in the cookbook Baking with Julia Child by Dorie Greenspan. I've been making them out of that book for years and they always turn out great. enjoyed the addition of dried cranberries as i usually use raisins

Amazing scone recipe. For cranberry lemon I've used 1c fresh cranberries and 1/4 c fresh lemon juice and zest of one lemon. I also did a version using no citrus but 3/4 t. almond extract and crushed candied almonds on top. Delightful. I make 16 smaller scones (2 rounds, chopped in 8ths) and bake at 375 for 25ish minutes. Spectacular frozen and warmed up for brunch.

Great recipe. I fell in love with the cranberry orange scones at Starbucks and then they stopped selling them in Chicago. I went on a quest to find a recipe and these scones are better than Starbucks (its the buttermilk!). Regardless if i make the dough too wet, too dry, etc; these always turn out fabulous. I took one person's suggestion to soak the cranberrys in orange juice so after i zest my orange, I squeeze the juice; microwave for 30 seconds and then steep the cranberry's until its time to mix them into the dough. I strain them first but they definitely make for juicy, more orange-y cranberries (if you want more orange flavor). I also use powdered buttermilk which has been a lifesaver. These freeze great! I know the scone purist say scones should be eaten right away but i actually think these are better after freezing and re-toasting in my toaster oven.- The flavors have had time to further develop and they stay crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Makes me happy to get up in the morning!

Please help - I've made these scones as directed in the recipe twice and each time been disappointed. They come out flat, and not scone like. First I thought the baking powder and baking soda was old, so i replaced and tried again based on the great reviews. The butter was very cold, cut into small dice and frozen for 15 minutes to ensure it was right. Same results. Any pointers?

Rating: 4
oops...20 min at 375 (cut into 10 scones). For 8 scones 25 min might be ok, but really watch for LIGHT browning. Tip: To keep them nice and moist, transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper on the bottom right after the 10 min cool down. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.

I have tried at least a dozen different recipes and this leaves them all in the dust. Truly the best and a very versitle base. I do reduce the salt to half or omit it all together, and here in sunny south florida I find all bake temps need to be cut by 25 degrees (so 375). My favorite variation is Cinnamon Chip Scones - replace the cranberries and orange zest with 5 oz of cinnamon chips and 1 tsp of cinnamon....yum yum.

Great recipe. Didn't have buttermilk, so I used regular milk and squeezed some of the orange juice into it from the orange I zested. 400 at 25 minutes was WAY too long, though. I took them out at 18 minutes and they were dark.

My go-to scone recipe. I make a batch of these at least once a month because my boyfriend goes crazy for them! As suggested by others, combining the butter and dry ingredients in a food processor saves a lot of time and trouble. Also, substituting milk and 1 tbs of lemon juice saves the trouble of having leftover buttermilk.

Rating: 4
These scones turned out fabulous, and were very easy to make. I put sifted flour and pieces of butter in food processor, and pulsed until it resembled coarse meal. I then returned the mixture to a bowl, and followed the remainder of the recipe as written. I also made an orange glaze with icing sugar, fresh orange juice and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. It was very good.

I was searching for a recipe to use up buttermilk, oranges and dried blueberries. This one fit the bill. These turned out delicious! I could barely wait for them to come out of the oven, the smelled so good. I reconstituted my blueberries in hot orange juice for an hour. I used 3/4 cup buttermilk with 1/4 cup OJ as other had. I used 1/2 cup sugar 'cuz I like my baked goods sweet. I also used 2 tablespoons of zest. The dough was too soft and sticky so instead of cutting into wedges I just formed them into 8 balls. Baked up nice and golden brown. I only baked for 20 minutes in my oven. I glazed them with an OJ, cream and powered sugar concoction after they cooled. They have stayed moist for 3 days. I just plop them onto a personal size frying pan to heat from the bottom, retain the bottom crunch and not to melt the glaze in the morning. Works for me and my growling stomach. I'll try cranberries or cherries the next time around. Bet they will be great, too.

I made these for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, and they were a big hit! I made the dough and cut the wedges the day before, then put them in the fridge (covered) over night. After 20 minutes in the oven they were perfect -- crunchy on the outside and delightfully crumbly and moist on the inside. I used pomelo zest, and glazed the tops with a 1:1 mix of orange mango juice and buttermilk (sprinkled with a little sugar) right before sticking them in the oven. Excellent!

I'm not a baker and I was a little hesitant to make these. I used a little more orange peel, one stick of butter, 3/4 c. buttermilk with 1/4 c. fresh orange juice and slightly more buttermilk when the dough looked too dry. They were delicious! My husband ate three, but hey, it's Valentine's Day.

Very good scone recipe, and I'm into scones so that is saying something. The only modifications I made were to use 3/4 c buttermilk and 1/4 c orange juice; used a little less sugar but added in a little brown sugar and briefly soaking the cranberries in hot water prior to adding them to the mix. I also found I needed a little more buttermilk to really bind the mixture (I might not have measured my flour precisely enough). They came out beautifully and much better than most "scones" offered for sale which I generally find too sweet. These have the right texture and aren't too sweet as written.

Great as written, and I have made this with about a million different substitutions because it is a wonderful basic recipe too. My latest: Maple-Pecan: Omit cranberries and orange and baking soda, substitute 2/3 cup heavy cream for buttermilk, add 1/3 cup real maple syrup and a teaspoon maple flavoring, reduce the granulated sugar, and add 3/4 cup toasted pecan pieces. I brushed the unbaked scones with a little cream/maple syrup and sprinkled with coarse sugar. Heavenly!

Love this recipe.... I use the "choice bake" selection on my oven, so that the upper element is cycling lower than normal, so they don't get overly browned. Mine only take about 14-16 minutes to bake. If you don't have this option, lower temp to 375. I roll out dough and use cookie cutter to yield more scones. Buttermilk and unsalted butter provide best results - and just a tad more than a cup of buttermilk. Brush tops with buttermilk wash before baking - makes a nice shiny appearance. Soaking cranberries makes them nice and soft - try it in orange juice for more orange flavour.

I changed a bit, due to lack of buttermilk. I used 1 cup chilled cream. Of course, that meant I used no baking soda, but increase the baking powder to 5 teaspoons. Used dried cherries and almond extract. This will be my basic scone recipe, and I will experiment with different touches. Very rich and not biscuit like at all.

This is fantastic. I love to bake, but hadn't tried scones before. These not only were easy, but they are absolutely delicious! I made three small changes: 1) doubled the orange peel 2) cut into 12ths not 8ths 3) sprinkled the tops with a little sugar. Love this recipe, will definitely make again!

These are the BEST scones I have ever had....with a few adjustments to the original recipe...I followed a few of other reviewers suggestions such as decreasing sugar to 1/2 Cup, decreasing butter to 1/2 cup ( I used unsalted frozen butter and grated it)...makes for a buttery flaky scone, increase orange rind to 2 tbsp...I also used fresh cranberries a little more than a cupful and about 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips...and increase the buttermilk to about 1 1/8 Cups. Let cool and drizzle with glaze made of icing sugar thinned with orange juice. These are to DIE FOR!! Enjoy

I used this recipe to finish some buttermilk. I followed the recipe but increased the orange peel to a whole orange (good flavor, not overpowering). I also plumped up the dried cranberries in boiling water for about 10 minutes and then chopped them as suggested earlier so you get cranberry in every bite (delish!). The scone dough was wet and, when formed as directed, they were rather large (one seems a good serving portion). When warm from the oven on the day they were made, they were good, not exceptional (seems like too much butter). But they freeze (and unfreeze - leave out for less than an hour) BEAUTIFULLY; the flavors seemed even better (and not overly buttery) at room temp. Make these and freeze them, then share with company when they pop by for coffee or tea.

Great recipe -- and thanks to all the previous reviewers whose comments I found very useful. I decreased the butter to 1 stick and increased the sugar to 1/2 cup (I use turbinado sugar, and it tends to be a little less intense than white sugar anyway, so that worked well). I also increased the orange rind to 2 tablespoons, added a little orange juice with the buttermilk and put in a cup of orange flavored cranberries. The result was a hit! One thing -- I can't imagine the size of the scones if one makes 8 of them -- I made 32!!

These scones are so scrumptious! They are flakier than a traditional scone, almost more like a sweet biscuit. Here are the changes I made: I used ½ c. sugar, 2 tablespoons grated orange peel, 1 ¼ c. fresh-frozen halved cranberries and I used regular milk with 1 tablespoon vinegar since I didnt have buttermilk. I lowered the temperature to 350 degrees and baked them about 15-20 minutes. After they were done baking I drizzled on a glaze of confectioner sugar, milk and almond flavoring. Yum!

While these have a great moist consistency, they are fairly bland. To help them, I'd double the orange zest, up the cranberries to 1 cup and chop the cranberries slightly so you get some in every bite. Leaving small pieces of butter in the dough does help to make them more moist. They only needed 20 min in my 400 oven.

I made these scones three times in as many weeks. The first two times, I used half a bag (about 6 ounces, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups) of halved fresh cranberries and the peel of a very large orange (approximately 1-1/2 to 2 tablespoons). They were delicious but needed additional sweetness to counteract the tart flavor of fresh cranberries. I spread a thin layer of passion mango butter on top, and it was perfect. A glaze of orange juice and confectioner's sugar, or a sprinkling of sugar would work well, too. By the third time, I was out of fresh cranberries and used the specified dried cranberries. I continued to use more orange peel and replaced half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. This was my favorite version, even though I'm not a huge fan of whole wheat, which added lovely flavor here. Each time I made these, I made three smaller rounds and cut them into fourths, sixths, or eighths. That way, I had an assortment of sizes that were just right for breakfast or a snack. This scone has just the right amount of "shortness"--that dry, biscuity (not cakey) texture that I associate with scones. Perhaps the lack of eggs contributes to this presentation. They keep a nice crust if I freeze them right away. After 3 days in a plastic container on the counter, they tasted fresh enough to serve to guests, but the outside was soft and I finally froze the rest.

I have made these scones twice, once as the recipe said, and once with black raspberries and white chocolate (about a half of a cup of both). Both times they have come out beautifully, with just the right consistency: light, fluffy, and crumbly. I would definitely make these again and I would love to try some other ingredients.

These were so easy to make. I made a couple of substitutions since my daughter has a milk allergy. I used vanilla soy milk in place of buttermilk and vegetable shortening in place of butter. I halved the recipe but used the full amount of citrus and the flavor was great. These turned out light, moist and scrumptious. It is the second time within a week I have made them to rave reviews and no one knows they are missing the dairy.

Absolutely the best I have ever made. Did not sift the dry ingredients, just put into a large bowl and whisked with a large balloon whisk, same results. Patted the dough into a rectangle, cut into six squares and cut each in half on the diagonal, 12 triangles, so pretty. In the past, I have made my scones in the Cuisinart, but I just read that mixing by hand and leaving larger butter lumps makes for a lighter, higher scone. This recipe is the proof. Thanks for a great one. I rarely give a recipe 4 forks, this one deserved more!

This is a favorite recipe--Easy and oh, so tasty. I usually mix them the night before, pop in a ziplock and then into the fridge. I make them smaller--rolling the dough into a square (more or less), then cutting into NINE squares (think tic-tac- toe) and then into triangles. This recipe makes 18 very nice portions. Also, since I never have buttermilk when I need it, I use 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 2 Tbsp orange juice and enough milk to measure one cup. It curdles nicely while I'm mixing the butter & flour. This is a GREAT recipe.

As written, it was good, but not as good as it could be. I liked it better with the entire zest of one large orange, 1 1/4 cups dried cranberries, and orange glaze. I used reduced-fat buttermilk with no harm to taste or texture. Next time we make these, we will add either orange extract or orange oil to the liquid ingredients before incorporation. There were a few spots that seemed to be just plain buttermilk biscuit. I think we'd prefer that the entire scone is orange-flavored.

I made this the Saturday before Mother's Day. I increased the orange zest (used the zest from 2 oranges) other than that, I made the recipe exactly as above. I incorporated all ingredients in a large stainless steel bowl and even kneading the dough in the bowl before transferring to a large ziplock bag. Kept it in the fridge over night, then cut open the baggie and sliced the round of dough (like a pizza) into 12 pieces. Baked on parchment lined sheet as directed. I just loved that there was no additional mess, as I had tried to minimize the clean up with guests arriving. I served it with whipped honey butter. I will positively make this again & again!

Any time I have overnight guests, I make these a day ahead and they never fail to impress. This is a terrific recipe just as it's written, though I do tend to throw in more cranberries and orange zest than the recipe calls for. Delicious, not too dry, and very easy to make!

Rating: 4
Really great. I would say that the amount of cranberries and orange zest, to a point, should be added to taste. I used more of both and the result was perfect. One caveat- the recipe does not double well. I thought I would be a hero and make extra to bring in to work, but the doubled batch of dough was overly sticky and the resulting scones had a subtle, but noticable, taste of baking powder/soda. If you opt to double, I'd suggest increasing the amount of baking powder and soda, as well as the buttermilk, by only half.

Perfect. Easy to make, tasty, moist without even a hint of being doughy. Finally, a scone recipe I want to make again. I molded the dough into an oblong shape and cut 12 squares. No need to butter and slather with jam... the flavor's there already. Next time I'm going to try it with lemon peel and dried blueberries.

Just right! Came out of the oven lightly golden flakey and little bit dry just like a scone should. I loved the orange flavor playing off the "stuff" and not enough scone but not on this recipe. A definite keeper. I get twelve out of the batch by cutting an inner circle divide that in quarters and the outside ring in 8ths, this cuts down the size of the scone just a bit.

Fantastic -- at first, I thought that 1 1/2 sticks was too much butter, but I tried it anyway and was glad I did -- they turned out super flaky and delicious! And I made 12 instead of 8, otherwise they are huge. Also, when you make 8, they're about 350 calories each, but 12 makes them more like 240 calories each (which is more like the amount I want to be eating for breakfast!). I forgot to add the sugar the first time I made them, but even then they were fantastic. In fact, I might make them without the sugar again...

These were fantastic!!! Everyone loved them and they were delicious!! I didn't have buttermilk so I used plain yogurt thined with milk and they tasted just as yummy!

These were better than a bakery. I used 1 cup fresh halved cranberries which gave those little moist pockets of cranberry burst I love, but I added an extra 3 tablespoons of sugar to balance the tartness. Baked for about 20 minutes until they just started to brown on the sides and top. They were delicious, but next time I will add more orange zest or some juice to give it an extra kick, add some shine to the top with egg white and maybe put little spirals of orange peel on the tops for decoration. Also, CUT THEM SMALLER; I could have easily gotten 10-12 scones out of the recipe when it calls for 8.

We've made these scones many times. It's a really good and easy recipe. You don't have to change a thing. I have used low-fat buttermilk and they taste the same - terrific.

This is my best scone Recipe - try not and overwork the dough - I have always used my food processor to mix the butter and flour - I had mix the wet ingredients - these are puffy, moist and the best! I always get rave's on them. I also use all kinds of ingredients not just dried cranberries - I have what I prefer to call my Old Fruit Scones - I will put the last of my down to the last 1/4 cups of apricots, dates, raisins etc....and by request I did chocolate chips - dried butter milk is an expectable alternative when the "real" thing in not on had! - as for unsalted butter? what's up with that. It really does not matter either way they are always also a hit.

Very delicate and tender, not at all like the dense scones I'm used to... these are flaky and flavorful.

These are amazing. So full of flavor but not too heavy. I used 1 tbsp of peel as the recipe directs and thought it was plenty. I did try cutting back on the butter the second time I made these, and could tell the difference. I will make these as is from now on.

The best scone, with minor modifications. Substitute buttermilk with 2%, replace dried cranberries with whole and fresh cranberries, and reduce baking time to 15 minutes. Unbelievable...

Wonderful. Living on a sailboat, I don't always have the ingredients called for. In this case, I substitited raisins for cranberries and substituted regular milk mixed with one tbsp white vinegar for the buttermilk. They turned out spectacular - best my husband says he's ever had.

I agree with other readers that 15 minutes baking time is better than the recommended time of 25 min. I also used the zest of a whole orange and used a biscuit cutter to make 12 scones of perfect size - excellent taste and appearance; have already made this recipe twice. I also did an egg wash on top and sprinkled with coarse sugar. Perfect!

Rating: 4
Made these for my husband who LOVES cranberry-orange anything, especially scones. Drawing on the advice from other cooks, I did the dry buttermilk substitution, used fresh instead of dried cranberries, and topped with a buttermilk wash and a sprinkling of turbinado sugar. They didn't rise as high and they spread a little more than I expected but they were very, very moist and tasty, and the sweetness on top was a good balance for the cranberries (the fresh ones were refreshingly tart but a little bitter). Next time I may try dried cranberries like the recipe suggests, but this is a keeper. Better than a coffee house!

Rating: 4
I make these all the time, to the delight of my friends and family... they beg me for them! I alter the recipe as follows: use the zest from one whole orange, use 1 1/4 cu of cranberries and chop them for a less chewy experience, lower the temperature to 350 because the bottoms tend to burn & adjust cooking time accordingly, use a (kitchenaid) mixer - much easier, make 2 rounds instead of 1 to make smaller scones, add a buttermilk wash and sprinkle with raw turbinado sugar. I've had good experiences freezing the unbaked dough (already cut into wedges, but without the wash & sugar) and baking what I needed at the time. Absolutely fantastic!

Rating: 4
These are perfect! Decided to make these this morning for breakfast in lieu of walking downtown for the coffee chain version which are always covered in sugar or icing and way too sweet for my taste. I followed the recipe exactly but shaped the dough into a long rectangle and then cut into squares which I cut again diagonally into triangles. Yielded about 30 small scones. The scones were wonderful! I served them with an assortment of jams for the sugar lovers in my family. They disappeared fast and my husband wants to know if I will make them every morning.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Like suggested, I added a little more sugar to the dough. I also altered the recipe by using tangerines instead of oranges and dried sour cherries instead of cranberries. I used all organic ingredients including a rustic whole wheat baking flour. The results were great. We enjoyed them warm from the oven with some espresso on the patio for breakfast on Thanksgiving day. What a treat.

I thought earlier nay-sayers were being food snobs, but I have to admit this recipe just isnt a scone to me at all. I took others advice and added 2 T of zest, but still the excessive buttery taste overwhelmed all else. they were too much like biscuits from KFC for me. I'm looking elsewhere for the dense light scones I love.

my last entry didn't post. These were FANTASTIC!! Just made them this morning for New Years breakfast. Everybody LOVED them! I added extra, 2T. sugar and 1T Orange Peel. Also used salted butter. I chopped cranberries up and added pecans to part of the batch for hubby. I also made 12 wedges, as opposed to 8 (perfect size). When I make these again, I will do them exactly as I did this morning. They were perfect! HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!

I wish I could give three and a half forks... Very Very Very good scones. Took them to friends for brunch and they were raved over. I didn't have oranges (I always have oranges!) so I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and aprox. a cup of chopped pecans. Delicious! Definately makes more than the recipe states. Adding to my favorites.

A very good recipe, the scones looked beautiful! I think I'd add just a little bit more sugar and salt and another tablespoon of orange zest. And they are HUGE, as others said. Next time I'll make two rounds and get 16 scones rather than 8.

Made these last night for a brunch I catered this morning. I followed other's suggestions and made 2 rounds and cut eight wedges from each. They were still a little larger than I wanted. Will probably try 3 rounds next time. But DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly and they were THE most popular item on the table (over fresh fruits, 3 varieties of fresh muffins and fresh butter croissants). They will become a staple in my recipe cache.

Rating: 2
Not a bad scone recipe. However, they are not as flaky as a true scone should be. Plus, they lacked a true orange flavor. I wonder if all of these rave reviews reflect the "American" taste for a cakier scone than is traditionally made in Europe...

Rating: 4
This recipe is DELICIOUS! I've made this about 9 times, and have gotten comments like I should sell these scones to Starbucks. This is everything that you want in a scone-- good texture, soft on the inside, tasty. I would recommend, like others have, to add 2 tablespoons of orange or lemon zest. I've made them with apricot and also lemon/blueberry, which turned out great also. I also used the scone pan from Williams-Sonoma to make them a triangle shape, which makes 8 large scones.

Rating: 3
These scones are wonderful! One of the best things about them is that they're nice and moist. As a side note, I didn't use the entire amount of butter suggested (I only used one stick, instead of one and a half). Another additional thing I did was to make a glaze with orange juice and powdered sugar, then drizzled it on top of the scones after they were cooled.

Rating: 3
I thought these were really good, and I would make them again. BUT!! (isn't there always a "BUT"!?!) When I made them, I doubled the recipe, and used 1 1/2 sticks of butter, plus about 1/4 c of Smart Balance Margarine. Then, it seemed too dry, so I just added more buttermilk. I also mixed some powdered sugar into some orange juice and glazed the scones when they came out of the oven. They were really good, and everyone in my family liked them. They'll be known as "the Hurricane Frances Scones"!

Rating: 4
The best scone recipe I have found! I divide the dough and make two discs and cut to make the scones a little smaller when baked. I also brush some buttermilk before baking and scones have a nice sheen to top crust.

This was a great scone, lovely flavor without being too dry. I added LOTS of orange rind and chocolate and omitted the cranberries. I got a lovely orange chocolate scone that was amazing for brunch with coffee. Use a scone pan from William Sonoma for a scone that looks and tastes like it came from a fanct bakery.

I too enjoyed the scones but found that they needed more of an orange taste. I added 1 tsp. of orange essence & sprinkled the tops of the scones with a blend of orange zest and sugar.

To the cook in Dallas Texas, may I recommmend sprinkling some turbinado sugar (that's the course "raw" sugar) on the scones before baking. Or, as an alternative, make a glaze using some 10x sugar and milk and pour it over the scones while they cool on a rack. I prefer this method--they come out really yummy!!

This recipe is fabulous! Everyone love them. I did two little changes though, HI substituted the buttermilk for 15% cooking cream and I also added one egg.

I combined this recipe with another one on this site for cranberry-tangerine scones. The tangerine is a "sweeter" aroma and flavor than orange, I think. The texture of these scones was unbelievable--very soft and moist and delicate. I did the first steps in my food processor--made it very easy and quick. I also made 2 disk and cut into 16 pieces, total, and baked for about 15 minutes. The smaller size fit next to my teacup on the saucer. Perfect.

I used the sweetened dried cranberries from Costco. It tasted great. However, next time I think that I would halve dough and form each half into a 7-inch round and then cut each half into 8 wedges and bake for 20 minutes (just like the cheddar chive scone recipe).

Absolutely delicious! Golden brown on the outside, moist and fluffy on the inside. I added twice the amount of grated orange peel so the orange flavor really came through. Instead of wedges, I made rounds with a cookie cutter. These scones are slightly sweet so they could be eaten by themselves or with jam. I used an egg wash before baking these to give them a golden sheen. This is definitely the best scone recipe!

As per previous comment, I chopped up cranberry. I also brush the top with buttermilk, sprinkle with suger. Came our wirh wonderful texture and a bit of sweetness. Very good.

Followed the recipe accept used dry buttermilk mix. Next time I would use half and half. I was surprised there was no egg. That would have made made them a little less dry, I think.

Excellent~! This recipe was quick and easy to make. The results were lightly crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside.

Have used this recipe many times with excellent results. Expect a traditional tasting scone -- not unduly sweet, heavy or moist (yikes!) like the ones served in most coffee shops. These are a simple comfort and just what they should be. Cutting into 8 wedges makes very large scones. Instead, use a 3 inch round cutter (yields 12) and reduce the baking time to 18-20 minutes. Your husband will wait longingly by the kitchen door...for 5 minutes less.

These are wonderful. I did not have any orange in the house, but I still thought they were great. They are more like shortbread as is traditional than the too-sweet muffin-like scones you get at most coffee shops. I made twice as many scones than they suggest in the recipe and they were still more than big enough.

Hmm-I was dissapointed! My kids-avid scone lovers-hated them. Made in food processor up to adding the buttermilk. Scones were doughy and compressed after baking. If I made this again I would add more sugar and more orange peel. Definately chop cranberries and add icing of some sort!

This is a great recipe, although I think it would have been even better with a little sugar sprinkled on top. Also, I coarsely chopped the cranberries so they would be a little less chewy.

This was a great recipe. I am a new cook and have never tried making scones before (though am an avid consumer). The texture was exactly what I wanted to capture: not too heavy and tasty. My guests enjoyed it so much that they did not place jam or cream on top. My only suggestion is the oven time. My scones cooked in 10-11 minutes at 400 degrees in a Thermador oven, and not 25min as suggested in the recipe. One should monitor the scones pretty attentively after 8min in oven to guage whether they are already cooked.

Rating: 3
I use this recipe constantly, substituting the orange and cranberries with other things I happen to have in the pantry at that time. It's always great! I do brush the tops w/melted butter and sprinkle on sugar before baking...just personal preference. I wouldn't add that touch if I wanted to make savory scones...

I made this recipe for my mom who is a scone fanatic. I don't know what she thinks yet, but I love them! I made them twice today - once using parchment and the second time using a silpat. I would recommend turning the temperature down to 375 AND using a silpat instead of parchment. Using parchment at 400 burned the bottoms.

July 2001: Sigh, what is my problem? I am an experienced baker and made this recipe very, very carefully three times. It is just too wet. Attempt 1: Too wet to be taken out of the bowl. Chilling it helped, but after baking it, the inside was wet and compressed. Attempt 2: Ran out of buttermilk, so I put it in the fridge, got buttermilk, and continued the next morning. Same results, of course. Attempt 3: Used 3/4 c buttermilk, though I probably should have stopped at 5/8c. Only slightly too wet this time. P.S. Using the zest from an entire orange is a good modification. April 2002: Now that I have a food processor, I decided to find out if the 4th time would be the charm. Yay, the dough was not wet at all! I must have been overworking the butter before or reading a measurement wrong? I feel a lot better now :) These were good and had the flaky, layered texture of biscuits. Again, I used the zest from one whole orange. Next time, I'm going to increase it even more or add some orange oil. Even though I made 12 scones instead of 8, I still wished I had decreased the oven temp slightly (and increased the baking time accordingly).

YUM! Every single review of this recipe is great, and now I know why! They are absolutely wonderful!! I took several suggestions from other reviews that turned out great. First, I divided the dough into two circles and then cut each circle into 6 wedges, which resulted in very nicely sized scones. Second, I brushed the tops with milk and then sprinkled with sugar before baking, which gave the tops a delicious crunchy texture. They have received rave reviews from everyone who has tried them. I can't wait to make them again!

It was the first time I ever made scones and these turned out fab. My husband (who is a self-proclaimed scone expert) said that these scones were the best he ever tasted. I did make a few additions. I did not have buttermilk so I made my own using milk and lemon juice. I also added 2 tsp of Cointreau to the milk mixture and I added about 1/2 C walnut pieces. I took the advice of another reviewer and used frozen cranberries and upped the orange peel to 2 tablespoons.

This is a good scone recipe. I used the suggestion of another reviewer and increased the amuont of orange peel to 2 tablespoons. I had to bake with several children at my son's school. This recipe was very kid-friendly to bake, although they weren't as fond of the scones as they were of the pumpkin-chocolate chip muffins they made. Everyone else who tried them, loved them. The cranberry and orange flavors are wonderful in a warm scone. It easily makes 10 sizeable scones. I used a heart-shaped cookie-cutter to have the kids press them for Valentine's breakfast. I already made the recipe twice.

A very light and sweet scone--my very favorite type! I increased the cranberries and orange peel and they came out perfectly. Also, they make 8 really big scones.

I like the texture it produces on top.

Simply succulent scones! Toasty golden colour, top and bottom. (I painted the tops with a little egg yolk and milk wash, to ensure pure gold colour on top.) Moist, light, fluffy, and flavourful. "Inhaled" by a party of Christmas carollers on a snowy Canadian December afternoon. I did not separate the scones by 2 inches on the pan, but just pushed them slightly apart, one from the other. The paper underneath seemed to prevent them being over-browned on the undersides. These would make a nice "take along" gift.

These are very good, much tastier than the average scone. My husband prefers these. I used chopped frozen cranberries instead of dried. I did notice that They took longer to cook than anticipated and therefore became too brown. The second time I baked them I made the scones small which took care of that problem.

Made some last night before bed and just had to eat one. Scone has a nice, "biscuity" texture. Both the cranberry and orange peel add a lot of flavor. Next time I would mix in another 1/2 Tbs of orange peel because I love oranges. Eating one now...Definitely a keeper!

Was all set to make this and discovered I only had 1/4 cup of butter. In desperation, I stuck 1/2 cup of vegetable shortening in the freezer to firm it up and used that. I expected disaster, but what I got was not bad at all - more like a tender biscuit than a scone and with a wonderful flavor (I used 1 1/2 Tbsp. orange peel and 1 cup of cranberries). Looking forward to doing it again, the right way.

These really are wonderful. As for keeping buttermilk on hand, try using dry buttermilk (available in MD under the brand name Saco). You simply add the dry powder to the other dry ingredients; the directions suggest using water with this product, but I generally use rice milk or rice milk -- I'm lactose-intolerant, and this seems to work. I also suggest brushing the the scones with cream before putting them in the oven, and baking them on an inverted baking sheet to reduce the chances of scorched bottoms.

These are fantastic, my whole family loves them including my two year old. I have to make a double batch every time I make them now.
