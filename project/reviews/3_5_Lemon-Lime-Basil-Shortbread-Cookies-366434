These are delicious but I can't understand where the 20 min. baking time came from. About 10 minutes tops (even slightly under depending on cookie sheet) was enough. Mine looked thinner than those in the photo (perhaps some of the difference in baking time). Just watch them closely! I made several batches and decided i liked them best with same quantity of the lime zest as the lemon.

The first recipe I found and made off this site, been hooked ever since. Thank You Epicurious! A light, crumbly not so sweet, yet not completely savory cookie. Love these.

I'm surprised that others didn't have a problem with the dryness of the dough. It was never moist enough to form a ball even after adding another tablespoon of water. I ended up putting in a pan as a bar cookie. I could taste the basil but not the lemon or lime. I wouldn't bother again.

Smelled like Christmas when baking, but I should have read the reviews. NO WAY 20 minutes! 15 tops and be careful you don't make them too thin. They will not expand when cooking, so the size you make is the size you get. I pressed them too thin and almost burned the whole batch. However, fairly easy and very yummy!

This recipe didn't work for me - literally. The cookies ended up a crumbled mess - I used butter at room temperature and this caused disastrous results. After the first batch was ruined, I put the batter in the fridge until it was firm. This helped with baking the second time, but the cookies were still too fragile. While the taste is good, you need to know what you're doing with baking to make these.

Lovely little cookie, very easy to put together. I skipped the sanding sugar and watched carefully as I baked for 14 minutes or so. Basil was not overpowering and they were not too sweet, but don't think you could call them savory. I wonder how they would taste with other herbs? I always have an over abundance of rosemary in my garden! The only shame is the recipe just makes 16 cookies, as now I am going to have to make another batch way too soon!

Made according to recipe. . but substituted fresh lime thyme for the basil. Definitely less cooking time. . 9-10 min. max.Did not use the sanding sugar. . dusted while warm and before serving with powdered sugar.

This cookie was a hit at a ladies luncheon and at a family get together. I had many requests for the recipe. I used only lime zest and juice and loved the balance of citrus and herb. I cooked them for about 15 minutes. They did turn brown on the edges but the crispness was wonderful.

I was fine with the end result. I made them as a part of a hostess gift before visiting friends. They served that purpose well. For someone who can appreciate this type of cookie, it makes a nice gift. Their rustic charm is appealing. I do think they're a bit labor intensive for the result. I'd have been happier if they took half as may steps to make and made twice as many cookies (though it's always good to have smaller batch recipes as well). And the method could probably be simplified by a knowledgeable baker (I'd ask my sister). It's nice the ingredients are items I always have on hand, so I'm sure I'll make them again in a pinch. Do pay attention to other comments about the cooking time. It's far too long. I wouldn't bake them longer than 12 minutes. Parchment paper is probably a good idea too. I crumbled a couple removing them from the cookie sheet.

Really nice prepared exactly as written (sans sugar). Served with macerated berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries) and homemade strawberry frozen yogurt (strawberries, Fage greek yogurt, skim milk and sugar). Everyone loved it!

The dough was easy to prepare and had simple ingredients already in my kitchen. Lovely taste and no single ingredient overpowered the other. Will definitely make them again.

My husband and I love these cookies which I make without the sanding sugar. I make them smaller, getting about 30 cookies, and bake 12-14 minutes. It's great to have a cookie recipe using chilled butter!

These were delicious - but definitely cut the baking time. My first batch were burnt. The second batch - yum!

A friend brought these cookies over last night for a dinner party. She did the dough at home and then baked them here so we could eat them warm. They were FANTASTIC. Light, flaky. She told me she followed the recipe, though only baked for 15 minutes and made sure they were quite small - about an inch in diameter. Highly recommend!

I loved them and so did the rest of my family. The citrus is predominant, but there is a hint of basil that I really like. Simple to make and 12 minutes is just right for baking time.

Not bad, but not great. Pros: fast to make. Decent citrus shortbread. Cons: The fact that the basil gets cooked too much during baking. This cooked basil is a scent more than a taste, and reminds me of Italian dishes (and I LOVE basil- but here I feel it should have been fresher tasting). The recipe doesn't specify how thick the cookies should be. Mine were rather thick looking when pressed to 2 inches as directed, but the recipe photo looks thinner. This could also be why so many people have different results with timing.

Really loved these -- The key to getting them to 'perfect shortbread' that does not crumble or spread is to make sure the butter combines properly with the other ingredients: DOUGH TIPS: (1) Do not melt the butter. I softened mine to room temp for more manageable dough and a slightly denser result. (2) To keep the consistency dense-yet-light and prevent them from spreading out, I used only 6 to 6 1/2 Tbsp of butter (cut between the 1/3 c and 1/2 cup mark) instead of the full 1/2 c. (3) AFTER pulsing the ingredients together in the food processor, let them sit for a few minutes so the butter can soften up. This will make it easier to squish the dough into a more play-dough-like consistency that will create a solid-but-crispy cookie instead of one that crumbles apart. TEMPERATURE: I did mine on 350 for 15 min; be sure to rotate pan halfway through, and pull them out before the edges show ANY blush of color.

Wasn't sure if I wanted to try these cookies based on so many mixed reviews, but SO GLAD I DID! Recipe is very easy. Cookies turned out to be very light and crispy. Basil, lemon and lime zest add a great flavor. As suggested I only baked them for 12 min instead of 20, they turned out great. They didn't crumple for me at all, but maybe because I mixed up the batter by hand into a very soft consistency which kept its form during and post baking.

Certainly not the best shortbread that I've had. The cookies spread out and were paper thin and the baking time was only about 11 minutes, not the 20 the recipe called for.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious! I agree with the cooking time 12 minutes maximum. As far as the crumbly part when processing...be patient it will come together.

I really, really, really wanted to like these, with the unusual (for a cookie) basil lime flavors. Cooked them 14 minutes as others recommended, on parchment paper, and the edges were dark. They had a wonderful shortbread texture, but the taste was like kissing a lemon  and Im a huge lemon fan. There was no lime or basil flavor at all, only overwhelmingly lemon. I considered trying again and experimenting with the lemon/lime/basil measurements, but judging by the other comments, I dont think fresh basil flavor will persist in baked goods. There are plenty of other good shortbread recipes out there.

These cookies were just lovely. They were so simple to make with the food processor, and had just the right flavor. Coming right out of the oven, they were especially basil tasting and a little crumbly, but once chilled in the refrigerator overnight, they tasted even better, more citrusy and didn't crumble. Overall worth making!

These were OK. I used lemon basil, which seemed to go well. It's pretty inexcusable to print a recipe with the baking time at double what it needs to be, though.

This recipe caught my eye! Followed recipe exactly but decreased baking time. They came out great! Perfect for a hostess gift for the total epicurian. I was a bit frightened they might be too green but the green tinge disappeared after baking. Basil flavor overall = slight to none.

Rating: 2
Thought the recipe was intriguing so I tried it. It turned out to be a nice, not-too-sweet citrus shortbread but to me and others, the basil flavor did not come through. And although I did not use any sanding sugar (or other sugar except for the powdered sugar called for in the dough), I wouldn't call these savory cookies. In short, these were good (2 1/2 fork), not delicious (3 fork) citrus shortbread.

Loved these and knew 20 min would be too long so baked them at about 13 min and watched for brown edges. I think they would be good made smaller and served with cheese as an appetizer also . 16 cooks isn't enough so I made two batches Yum

I made these today. As I was putting them on the cookie sheet my power went out! It came back on 2 hrs later and I baked them at room temp,that is why I thought they cooked to fast. But looking at other review I think the recipe is wrong for cooking time. 12 min is good. Son and husband (and me!) loved them!! I doubled the recipe and wouldn't change a thing. Egg, are you crazy? This is shortbread cookies!

Rating: 3
Didn't need an egg, and baking 12 min was perfect. Thank you reviewers!! My husband found these a tad too basil-y, but I found them lemony. I think it just depends on your taste sensitivity. In the end, we both thought these were lovely.

Whoa! Next time I make these, I'll dial back on the basil, which gave these cookies a faintly medicinal taste. They disappeared, though.

Fabulously delicious! I just wish I saw the recommendation to cut the baking time before I made them. Thank goodness the recipe is for a small batch. Will cut it down to 12-14 minutes the next time I make these.

These cookies are easy to make and have a lovely, subtle taste without being too sweet. I agree with the other reviewers that the ideal baking time is 12-14 minutes. Also, while the batter initially looks "sandy" in the food processor, keep blending and it will come together without the need for an egg.

Rating: 3
Great flavor. Agree with other reviewers regarding bake time, 20 minutes gave me almost burnt cookies. Baked a 2nd batch at 12 minutes, yummy!

Rating: 4
the recipe doesn't need an egg, it comes together thanks to lemon juice and butter. But the baking time is not correct, as 20 minutes at 375 will burn your cookies. 12 to 14 minutes is what worked for me, and they were delicious!

OK--figured out the missing wet ingredient--an egg. Added an egg and got a delicious cookie. Only needed to cook for 13-14 minutes rather than the 20 listed also.

I forgot to mention one thing in my review: the bake time of 20 minutes is much too long: my batch was nicely browned at 14 minutes. I'd suggest checking them at about 12 minutes.

These were quick, easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problem at all. I believe the previous reviewer may have left out the one tablespoon of lemon juice called for in the dough. The lemon-basil flavor is subtle but definitely comes through. To the previous reviewer: please try these again! If you were interested enough to try the recipe in the first place, I think you will really enjoy these cookies.
