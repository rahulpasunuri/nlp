While I agree that this isn't the most sophisticated lasagna, I think its simplicity and good flavor make it deserving of its blue ribbon. I used crushed tomatoes for the sauce and will experiment with more vegetables, like spinach, next time. A great lasagna foundation!

I picked this recipe because it was labeled as "quick". Not true. With baking time, a good 2 hours invested!! It's in the oven now, and I'm sure it will be really good but the quick part is very untrue...

We made it with spicy, chicken, apple sausage so it would be tasty for us and mild for the kids. The flat, no-cook pasta was a very good call. This is now our new favorite lasagna!

Very quick and little hassle! I washed the few dirty dishes while the sauce reduced. Accidentally doubled the mushrooms and would intentionally do it again, I also would double (or 1.5x) the ricotta and reduce the grated cheese by half. Definitely a comfort food keeper!

Not rating this because I didn't make it but I am surprised this recipe is even here. Your results are only going to be as good as the jar of sauce you use...This recipe should be on the back of the bottle not in Bon Apppetit. This isn't cooking, it is assembling. Really... cooking the sauce from scratch wouldnt take that much longer and you would actually KNOW what is in it... added sugars, preservatives etc.... I will make my own thanks.

Not quick, but still extremely delicious. Used boiled noodles as there were no no-boil noodles at my local organic market, still worked like a charm. Make sure to drain the fat off of the sausage! The dish is fatty enough without extra sausage oil floating around in there.

Combined this recipe with some of the 3 cheese recipe, used 2 hot and 3 sweet sausages and fresh herbs from garden. Cooked sausage separately and drained off fat. No way will this fit in one 13x9x2 baking dish, I got two out of it! Everyone loved it, try it.

Awesome lasagne! Turned out delicious, but as other reviewers have noted, it was definitely not "quick." Partly, I'm just not a fan of things like pre-chopped mushrooms or bagged shredded "Italian cheese mix," so I did those things myself and that tacked on some time. I did buy jarred marinara sauce to cut down some time in that department (Lidia's tastes almost like homemade). I was slightly nervous about the no-boil lasagne noodles (I was advised at the store that they soak up tons of moisture and that I should be watchful of my lasagne drying out) but they were fine. This is an awesome recipe and it makes a ton of leftovers -- will keep it in the repertoire for sure.

This was dowright delicious! My boyfriend and I devoured this and I will be making it again in the coming weeks. The wine gives it a wonderfully rich flavour (and colour), and the trick to getting it to reduce quickly is to have the heat on HIGH. Otherwise, yes, it will take 6-10 minutes to reduce if you are only using medium or medium high heat. I almost doubled the amount of sausage, onions and mushrooms, so was definitely not able to get all the layers in the pan size called for (so I made a mini one as well.) The hot Italian sausage gives it a great kick, but not too spicy. I added spinach for colour and flavour as well, and used more ricotta cheese than called for. I also used almost two jars of the marinara sauce. It baked for 45 minutes tented with foil, then another 10 minutes or so to brown the cheese, and sat for 20 minutes (and was easily able to cut it at that point.) Not "quick" like the recipe says, but it's easy, very worth it and highly recommended. I can't wait to make this again!

In preface, I am by no means a professional when it comes to cuisine. That being said, I thought this lasagna dish was absolutely amazing. Immediately after having cooked it, it was the best lasagna I've ever had in my life. After having reheated it over the next several days, it was the best reheated lasagna I've ever had in my life. The only con to this dish is that it was a bit expensive (although it lasted me four days) and it took at least an hour and a half for me to do the prep work with approximately another hour and a half of baking. Enjoy!!!!

This was good, not a once in a life time lasagna experience, but good. Next time I would try something new. Still searching for the perfect recipe to which no other is equal.(And if i did make this again I would totally skip the last layer of noodles, I'd put the final layer of sauce directly over the last layer of cheeses and sausage. My top noodles got kind of dried out.)

While it may not be as quick to make as the title suggests, and the wine takes a good 5-7mins to cook in the mixture, it is really good, I make a béchamel instead of using ricotta. It adds a nice richness. It's a huge hit with the family.

Rating: 4
This is a definite crowd pleaser. I sometimes like to throw in a layer of zucini or spinach to make it a little healthier. I followed a tip from a reviewer about mixing the ricotta with the sausage, and it was much easier than spooning the ricotta as a single layer. I usually make 2 at once and freeze the 2nd one for later.

Rating: 3
Made as written, except maybe was a little more generous with the cheese. A few comments: First, does anyone really think that a full cup of wine really can mostly evaporate within *two* minutes? I suppose it's possible, if you have 800F heat at your disposal. For the rest of us, it'll take longer. Second, my overall comment is that this is a solid lasagna, but I'm not sure that it is really that time-saving. You're still cooking the mushrooms and onions, and then sausage, and the only thing you're really avoiding is making the sauce, which isn't entirely onerous to begin with. But as I say: solid, but not spectacular, recipe.

Fantastic. My first time ever attempting a lasagna and it turned out perfect! Next time may make my own marinara ahead of time to use, felt like I was cheating extra using the jars.

I love this one! The first two times I followed it to the T. The second time, I sort of eye balled the sauce layering stage and found it didn't quite have the exact same results. Definitely stick to the recipe. The best part is the no cook noodles (available at whole foods) and I used a little more than 1 package, and not having to cook the sauce ahead of time. The prep time is a little longer than quoted, I'd say about 2 hours total time, but it's a great crowd pleaser.

Very good and simple to make, I added some tomato paste to the mushrooms & sausage which added some richness and a little extra sauce. My husband teased me about using jarred sauce but he had 3 helpings. Made it for company and barely had any leftovers. The lasagna came together quickly and didn't waste time mixing everything in bowls just layer it on. I Will make again.

I use Fra Diavolo sauce in addition to regular marinara sauce and spicy Italian sausage for an extra kick. It provides nice heat, but not too much, and this lasagna has been a huge hit both times I've served it.

Agree with most everyone else: this was great! Not super-quick but worth it for the fabulous result. I made it vegetarian by using veggie sausage (didn't cook it much - just added it to the end of the mushroom/onion/wine mixture and heated it through). Also upped the protein quotient by adding a pound of well-drained tofu (squeezed most of the water out of it first) mixed with the ricotta and an organic egg. Added a couple teaspoons of dried red pepper to the marinara for zing. It was memorable!

Very good, but make sure you use a good quality sauce. I doubled the sausage and was glad I did so. Next time I'll probably add an additional half pound of mushrooms also (I'm a big mushroom fan). Used traditional lasagna noodles, so I precooked them, but didn't cook them all the way through. I only half-cooked them, and made sure they were totally covered with sauce, so that in the end they were perfect and not overcooked. Will try with spinach next time as suggested by previous reviewers.

I liked the taste of this lasagna - I didn't make any changes to the recipe as written. What I didn't like was the color of the mushrooms and sausage and wine together. It made for a very dark brown rather unappetizing color. Perhaps my red wine was too dark, but if I were to make this again, I would cook my sausage separate from the mushrooms and onions and probably omit the wine altogether.

This is pretty easy and really good. I don't recommend making any changes. It was great as leftovers too.

This was really, really delicious. The only thing I did differently was (as others have suggested) use some (thawed) frozen spinach. After defrosting the spinach, I blended it with the fresh ricotta in my food processor. This made the lasagna very beautiful in appearance as well as extremely delectable. The no-boil noodles worked just fine. I made sure to use plenty of sauce.

I made this last night and it was great. I wasn't sure that my family would like it (my 14 year old daughter doesn't like traditional lasagne) but they loved it! I used fresh sausages - 2 hot and 2 mild - no other substitutions. Took about 10 min (not 2) to reduce the wine. Total time is 1-1/2 hours...30 min prep, 45 min baking, 15 min resting. Will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe! As lasgna goes this was a fairly simply recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe states here and the whole family loved it. The only change I made was in the layers because I prefer to put my ricotta cheese on top of the noodles to get a nice thick even layer. The only other change I would make would be to add some basil to the ricotta and use more cheese in general... since I love cheese. Overall a fantastic recipe. I will most likely make this again.

It wasn't the "best ever" lasagna, but with the no-boil lasagna noodles, very easy. Oddly, I wound up with extra sauce at the end, and the tips of the noodles were a bit crunchy, so try to use all the sauce.

This was a superb recipe! Like some of the other reviewers suggested, I included a layer of (thawed) frozen spinach which added a whole other dimension to this recipe.

I made this for the second time, with some modifications. In order to hide the mushrooms from picky children, I threw them in the food processor, and chopped them about the size of the onions, and nearly got away with it (just one uspicious kid eyeing what looked like a mushroom remnant with disdain). I didn't have enough jarred sauce, so I threw together my own to supplement the one jar on hand. I also grated the cheese myself, as I have found that pre- grated cheese often has a different (fake) texture. I liked it even better this time. The mushrooms really boost the flavor, and I think the chopping in the processor enhanced the dish. I have increased my rating from 3 to 4. Even with making my own sauce, it was pretty quick to put together.

Rating: 4
This is a very tasty recipe. I do not think it is especially quick to make, but worth the effort. Some changes that I made include: 8oz crimini, 8oz portabella mushrooms, mixed the ricotta in with the sausage mix, used smoked mozzarella instead of the italian blend cheeses, and added small can of crushed tomatoes with chipotle to the sauce.

Rating: 4
Okay, so I messed up somehow and didn't manage to create as many layers as I was supposed to. I also ended up with cheese leftover - not sure how that happened. Other than that, this lasagna turned out fantastic! It didn't seem lacking in cheese. Next time, I would add more sauce though, as I found this lasagna to be a touch dryer than I usually prefer. Also, this lasagna definitely takes longer than one hour to make, but it's still quite easy. I'd make this again.

I have made this recipe several times and it's a hit every single time. My husband loves this lasagna! It's fairly easy (although there is some prep work with removing the casings and browning the sausage - but nothing too involved). I love that it doesn't have any exotic ingredients. Most of the time I can make this recipe on a whim. I make it as the directions state and am thrilled with it every time.

I made this for our Christmas dinner last night and it was a huge success. I wished I had doubled the ricotta mix. I used almost a whole jar of spaghetti sauce.

Not quick, but easy and delicious. Made according to directions except for addition of garlic to all phases of construction and added frozen spinach to middle layer of ricotta for vege power. Hubby hates wine, but loved the meat/mushroom layer (what he doesn't know won't hurt him). Think using the hot italian sausage keeps the dish tasty (not overpowering) instead of adding red pepper to sweet italian sausage as others have recommended. We will make this again in a deeper dish!

I substituted regular lasagna noodles for no-cook, mascarpone for ricotta, white wine for red, and fresh thyme for the dried seasoning blend.

I'm a guy and I like to cook, sometimes, as my wife will, at least, help with the clean-up. I was tiring of the watery and unsatisfying Stouffer's offerings my wife thought were so great. SO, I undertook this one, myself and it was well-liked by the family and me. Had bulk-packed sweet Italian sausage on-hand so I added maybe 1 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. Also, some fresh Thyme leaves snipped across the final layer before the last cheese. I may, also, try arranging the pasta sheets so each one touches one corner of the 13x9 dish instead of overlapping all in same direction. That way, hopefully, there won't be 1 1/2 inch wide gaps along the long sides of the pan, (since the long dimension of the rectangles doesn't reach across the short dimension of the pan). Also, I need to practice the timing of burning off the liquid before over-cooking the meat/vegetable mixture. Personal taste makes me plan to put in twice as much Ricotta next time. Otherwise, it was a wonderful, tasty, rustic-looking dish we'll use as a family standard!

Rating: 4
This was really good - I halved the recipe and used a 9x9 square pan. I used curly no-bake noodles because I had those on hand. This is really easy - the time is definitely off. I think it would be a good idea when sauteeing the mushrooms and onions to cook them to a point where all the water evaporates - that way when the wine is added it is reduced easier. Since i halved this, i did the sausage filling in a large skillet - that help the wine reduce faster as well.

Amazing! By far the easiest lasagna I've ever made! I used a great cabernet savignon (Broadside 2008) for the meat sauce. wow! We finished the bottle with dinner. Great match! The liquid for the meat sauce never reduced completely, no matter how long i cooked it. so, i went with it anyways and used it as it was (just a bit soupy). i totally failed in distributing the ingredients between the layers too. The top layer was seriously lacking in the meat sauce mixture. The bottom layer was about 3 times thicker than any of the other layser. Thankfully, it wasn't even noticable. I would highly recommend buying sausage without the casing like the recipe calls for. I got my sausage at costco (supper yummy) but i spent quite a bit of time & effort trying to remove the partially frozen sausages from their casings. Nightmare! Despite all my efforts to botch this dish, it turned out SUPERB! It was even better left over! My bf and friends raved and raved. The noodles turned out perfect and the italian blend of cheeses made it super easy. I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic and very very easy dish. To make it even easier, I mixed the Sausage mix with the Ricotta and then added it at the same time. It is just as good and saves some work trying to get the Ricotta to spread as its own layer. Great dish. Easy. Impresses

Wow! This a KEEPER. I haven't had lasagna this good in authentic Italian restaurants and I grew up in Chicago. I made this for a potluck at work and when my boyfriend found out I was attempting lasagna for the first time he insisted I make two. I made one with pork sausage and the other with chicken sausage (both sweet italian style with a dash of red pepper flake like the others suggested). I also took others advice and went to TJ's for the no boil lasagna noodles (the best), quattro formaggio and tomato basil sauce - although I think when it comes to the sauce you can use your favorite jar or homemade. This was a huge hit at both the potluck and the homefront. I think the wine and mushrooms are crucial to the recipe so I wouldn't recommend substituting or leaving out. I do agree that its not that quick to make but its still very simple. I already have the recipe memorized which is something I definitely appreciate on a weeknight. This will become a family staple for sure.

Good, quick lasagna. It took me exactly 40 minutes to prepare the lasagna; I am sure it will vary depending upon specific ingredients used, so I will mention mine: I used chicken Italian sausage, and added a light sprinkle of dried crushed red peppers to make sure it had a bit of heat. For seasoning, I used Penzey's Pasta sprinkle (but could probably just mix basil, oregano, thyme). I mixed Trader Joe's Quatrro Formagio (blend of parmesan, asiago, fontina, provolone) with mozzarella (50/50) for the cheese mix, and TJ's organic tomato/basil marinara sauce. Barilla no cook flat lasagna noodles worked great, I used all 16 noodles to make 4 layers and everything fit into my baking dish (to the very brim). My husband and I really liked it; I thought it was one of my better efforts at lasagna, but my 13 year old son did not like the mushrooms (at all!). I might try chopping the mushrooms very fine (like duxelles) to fool him next time (it's a texture thing for him, and probably lots of kids), but I think the mushroom flavor is very important. The only part that took longer than indicated was after adding wine (more like 5-7 minutes to evaporate all liquid), but in my experience, sausages vary widely in amount of liquid that results, so I was not surprised.

Rating: 4
This dish gets 4 forks for outcome, but is seriously misleading in timing and quantities. I used Trader Joe's imported no-cook lasagna, which are flat, not curly, and very delicate in flavor. Highly recommended for this dish. Also used their marinara sauce and sweet Italian sausages. Two 26-ounce jars of sauce yield 6-1/2 cups of sauce, not 4-2/3. That's okay - I used almost all of the two jars. Quantities of other ingredients were spot-on, but time to cook down the sausage/mushroom mixture was way off - took more like 30 minutes to reduce away most of the liquid. I was able to fit everything into a 13 x 9 x 2" pan, by pressing down gently on each layer. Assembled all this afternoon, then chilled until time to bake for dinner. Now there, the timing was right - and letting it rest for 15 minutes is essential to yield portions that can be neatly cut and remain intact. Flavor was superb, so worth the effort, even if not as 'quick' as the recipe would lead you to believe.

I've made this three times now and it is great. It is too deep for my 9x13 pan so I make one less layer and just stuff the two layers I am able to make. All jarred sauce works well and the red wine is a must. I need to invest in a deeper dish so I can make all of the layers, but it can work regardless.

Rating: 4
VERY good. Takes far longer than an hour, as other reviewers have mentioned. Taking the time to allow the flavors of the mushrooms, sausage, wine, etc. to come together is important and totally worthwhile for this dish. I added freshly grated mozarella to the top when I took the foil off. This was an absolute hit in my house and I will definitely be making it again.

Rating: 3
Very good flavor and comes together easily. This is a quicker lasagna than most, due to the pre-grated cheese and jarred sauce, but it definitely takes more than the advertised 1 hour. It bakes for 55 minutes, so there's no way it could take only an hour total. I thought the mushrooms and wine added a good richness of flavor. The amount of cheese is good, not over the top like some recipes are.

Okay, I guess I'm the naysayer here, but I found this lasagna too . . . too . . . something - I guess I'd have to say too rich. The wine and mushrooms gave it a flavor more like Beef Bourguignon than traditional lasagna. My husband didn't even believe me that it was lasagna. So, perhaps it's great if you're looking for something a little different. It was easy to prepare and it makes a large amount - use the deep dish if you have it. But it just wasn't the Italian flavor we were looking for.

This was really good and pretty easy. I didn't have any red wine, so I used chicken broth instead. Next time I would not make that substitution because I really think it diminished the complexity of flavor. I used extra garlic, red pepper flakes, and chopped fresh basil and spinach. I had two problems I want to share. First, I used a 10 oz. package of noodles, but it wasn't enough to make four full layers. Are there different sizes of lasagna noodles? Second, there was too much for my baking dish, which was definitely the size called for in the recipe. It ended up coming too far over the edges of the pan, so when it baked the top layer of noodles stuck out funny and made it look weird (but still tasted great). Anyone else have this problem? I can't figure out why it didn't fit; nothing I added took up much space. I would give it four forks for flavor, but I knocked it to three because of those problems.

Great lasagna recipe but not the best I've ever had as many mentioned. Quick, it is not! I prefer 3 layers of noodles not 4 but I did make this pretty much as written. I did use 2 jars of marinara sauce and would recommend more cheese than called for. I had regular lasagna noodles and used them instead of no boil. The result was not at all dry. One thing I did do, after adding the wine and trying to boil it to 'almost dry' I ended up straining the liquid from the meat mixture. Mushroom give off moisture and it seemed an endless process to get the liquid to disappear.

Made exactly as written, although I did use some extra sauce and chese. Couldn't have been better. Everyone raved over the taste. I have several lasgna recipes, but this one trumps them all with it's gourmet flavor. I've already passed the recipe on to sister and friends with instructions to MAKE THIS NOW - YOU'LL LOVE IT!

this was my first attempt at lasagne also. I used the sweet italian sausage and red pepper flakes and my family totally loved it! It was better each day for lunch that week. Yum-O! Can't wait to make again!

This was my first attempt at lasagna and I couldn't be happier with it. If there's a way to mess up a recipe I usually find it but this one was foolproof and so fun to make! I used diced chicken sausage and 1/2 marinara sauce--1/2 Cabernet marinara sauce. Still eating the leftovers and can't get over how tasty this is!

wow, this was great. made for a dinner party where I didn't have a whole lot of time, and it was pretty much exactly 2 hours from grocery bag to plate. And DELICIOUS! Used almost 3 jars of marinara since I like a saucy lasagna. Everyone at the party raved. Will definitely be making again and again.

Best lasagna I've ever had. I chose to use sweet turkey links and added hot pepper flakes for some heat. Had no red wine, so used some boxed chicken stock. But what really made this dish so good were the "no boil noodles." So much better then the curly edged noodles. The baby bella mushrooms were a great addition too. Very Good. My family enjoyed it.

Great recipe!!! I used ground Italian sausage instead of removing the casings off the links.....I would rather shred the cheese myself!!! Very delicious.....my 4 and 2 year olds loved it!!!
