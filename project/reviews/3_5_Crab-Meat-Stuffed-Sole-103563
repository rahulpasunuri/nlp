I followed this to the letter. (something I normally do not do). I found the addition of mayonnaise gross at best. It in combination with the crab left me with a sour stomach. There are a lot of good recipes out there for stuffed sole. This is certainly NOT one of them.

this was just ok. added some wine to the bottom as advised by others. I had a lot of leftover stuffing, so I mixed in fresh breadcrumbs, a few red pepper flakes and made 2 crab cakes. The crab cakes were a lot tastier than the stuffed sole.

This recipe is not workable for California. Please give me substitute ingredients for the fish ( which is not available here) and the crab (which I have never heard of)

after reading all the reviews, I had to spike the crab filling. I sauteed onions, garlic, red bell pepper, and parsley until soft. To the mixture, I added cayenne, dash of wostershire, and tsp of dijon. Cooled it, and then added crab, mayo, salt and pepper. Since I had about 1lb of crab, I up all the ingredients, and after using for the filling, I added panko and one egg, and had crab cakes for another day. I used true cod instead of sole, and panko for breadcrumbs. A little wine at the bottom of the pan, a lillte lemon juice too. baked 17 mins covered, and 4 with crumbs uncovered. Served over pasta tossed with butter, parsley, and chives. Yum!

This recipe turned out fabulous! I had to improvise because I had guests coming that were not eating dairy or wheat ... so instead of mayo, I used mashed avacado and instead of the bread crumbs I used sesame seeds! It turned out great and everyone loved it!

I used petrale sole and dungeoness crab because that was what was available. I omitted the peppers because my family doesn't care for them, added finely chopped green onion and some lemon zest and lemon juice to the filling and a bit of cayenne and because these fillets are thinner and longer than gray sole, I rolled them around the filling. I didn't even make the bread crumbs but made the Beurre Blanc sauce from Epicurious to go over the rolls. It was incredible!

While this isn't the most exciting dish, it's very nice and I gave it 4 forks for it's versatility, the fact that it isn't loaded with fat and that the method of cooking the fish works terrific. I stuffed mine with what I had on hand -- some finely chopped grilled zucchini and yellow squash, chopped sauteed shrimp, a touch of fresh mint, garlic, and reduced fat mayo blended with low fat greek yogurt and seasoned with salt and pepper. Did the rest as directed and myself and my husband really enjoyed it. Will definitely make again.

I used some suggestions from other reviews and added more peppers, onions, and Tony Cachere's seasoning to the filling. DH, who prefers everything fried, liked this. I will make it again.

I adapted some of the suggestions from the reviewers. I cooked some finely chopped onion with the pepper in butter, then added fresh dungenous crab. Added a little cayenne. Stuffed the filets with the crab mixture and baked for 20 minutes. Added the garlic bread crumbs for the last minute. Next time, I would reduce the baking time and perhaps add some wine as some others suggested. A light cream sauce might also be something to try. It was good the way I prepared it but next time I would experiment for more flavor.

I took a lot of the great ideas in these reviews to improve on this recipe. I sauted a little red onion, half a Serrano chile, Cajun seasoning (my husband likes heat), yellow bell pepper, a few shrimp, garlic and two tablespoons of the bread crumbs. Since I don't care for mayo I used two tablespoons of cottage cheese to bind it together. I also topped it with a Buerre Blanc sauce. With roasted asparagus it made a lovely Christmas Eve dinner for two.

This turned out very good, but I subsituted fresh chives, tarragon, and dill for the parsley. I served it with a lemon risotto and fresh asparagus for a fantastic meal.

While this dish was easy to make, I found it a bit bland. As another reviewer wrote, you couldn't distinguish the crab and the parsley was a bit overwhelming. I liked the breadcrumb topping, though. Perhaps a bit more tweaking as others suggested would make it more interesting.

Very nice. I used tilapia and added some breadcrumbs to the stuffing to help it hold together; it could still use more. I think next time I'd add a little bit of red pepper flakes or cayenne to the stuffing. Went very well with some dandelion greens on the side.

I loved this dish. I would make it again for sure. Next time I might add a bit of butter and lemon, but all in all it is great.

I changed it up a bit, using shrimp instead of crab and I also added sauteed fresh mushrooms. I blended the mushrooms in my food processor and skippped the peppers. To hold the mixture a bit better, I added some of the bread crumb mixture to the filling.

Good recipe....made adjustments, such as adding fennel to the crab mixture. Topped it with buerre blanc sauce. Lightened up on the bread crumbs.

Made for a dinner party and thought it was very elegant. Added bay shrimp, fresh dill, scallion, and cajon seasoning to the stuffing. Layered sliced portobella mushrooms on bottom of dish, placing fish ontop, then added a little wine before baking. Served with jasmine rice and roasted asparagus. Will definitely make again.

Elegant recipe that's better with tweaking recommended by other reviewers. I used yellow, red, and orange peppers for color and taste. Added some celery and shallots. Only had curley parsley, canned crab, and fat free mayo and it was still delicious. Spiced (Emeril's salt free Essence) both the fish and crab mixture and added white wine for more sauce. I cooked sliced portobellos in the same dish. Sprinkled fish and shrooms with the crumbs and browned all under the broiler in the end. Served on a bed of steamed spinach. Suitable for company!

I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added Cajun Seasoning to both the crab mixture and also sprinkled it on the sole. I also added about 4 tablespoons of diced shallots to the crab mixture. In the last few minutes, I took off the foil covering, put a dot of butter on each piece, and slipped them under the broiler for about one minute to brown the top. They were delicious. Will make for company in the future.

This lovely light dish is perfect for entertaining. The portions are a little on the small size so consider giving some guests two servings. We served this with lemon basmati rice and roasted snow peas. A wonderful dinner.

Had a lite, mayo taste to it but nothing special. Based on the reviews thought this would be a keeper. Tasted as if it was missing one more special ingredient.

I added some cajun spice to it and it was great!! A big hit at dinner.

this was a particularly simple recipe to pull together, and presented itself very well.... i made this recipe for my wife and i last saturday evening.... i accompanied the stuffed sole with risotto milanese (which was a superb complement to the dish).... overall, i thought the stuffed sole recipe lacked bite, and came across as somewhat bland in taste.... i could have easily added more salt than i did, but it was still very difficult to differentiate the crabmeat stuffing from the sole - and frankly, every bite tasted like white fish.... surprisingly, the parsley overpowered the essence of the crabmeat and became the dominant flavor of every forkful.... if i do make this recipe again, i might add some chili powder (chipotle pepper) to the crabmeat stuffing in order to give this dish a little more pop....

This is an excellent dish. Super easy to make and the fish stays moist and tasty. I also took the foil and parchment paper off 3 minutes early to apply the breadcrumbs and brown it a little. I don't particularly like parsley so I substituted some fresh corriander. I think it made all the differece.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. I used flounder, added a little stuffing with herbs to hold it together, decreased the mayo and used twice the crabmeat. I also cooked it a few minutes longer uncovered with the crumbs. Next time I will double the yellow pepper and parsley and try the white wine sauce.

This dish is requested every year at my Christmas Eve dinner. I substitute sauteed mushrooms for the peppers. As with many of the reviewers, I add more garlic and add wine to make more of a sauce. I also add a dab of butter on each. It may not be as low fat, but it makes it more luxurious for a special occasion.

I read the other reviews and also kicked it with a minced clove of garlic and an 1/8 teaspoon of curry powder, poured a little white wine over each piece. Was great. The breadcrumbs are superb.

Everybody said it was bland without extra help. So I decided to kick it up a little. I added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and doubled the yellow pepper and flat leaf parsley to the crab filling.Seasoned the filling well. Seasoned both sides of the sole and followed the recipe pretty much from there. Did add about half cup of a good Chennin Blanc to increase the sauce output. Cooked as recommended (20-22 minutes) and added another 3 minutes of cooking (parchment and foil off) after I dropped on the garlic bread crumbs. Turn out great and wasn't bland. Definately will do it again.

I have enjoyed this recipe a number of times with sole or flounder. Most recently I tried Orange Roughy. Sliced one large fillet into two horizontally and placed crab mixture between the two thinner pieces rather than creating a single packet for each person. Took the advice of previous reviewers and added white wine, also topped fish with bread crumbs and finished cooking uncovered. Very good and easy to prepare dish.

Rating: 1
A nice dish, but just awfully bland. Since the fish is so mild, it really needed a flavorful crab mixture, which this was not. Added extra garlic as suggested, but it still lacked flavor.

I made this recipe using Orange Roughy - it was delicious.

This was a good recipe made in a reasonable amount of time. I made this recipe because I just came from the store with some lemon sole fillets and wanted to do something creative without having to go BACK to the store for other ingredients! This meant I had to make substitutions: I used can crab meat instead of lump, diced fresh tomatoes instead of yellow bell pepper. I didn't use the parsley (I didn't have any). For the garlic bread crumbs, I added some pine nuts. The previous reviews indicated that this dish needed more sauce ... so I added about half a cup of dry white wine before I baked it. After baking, I sprinkled the bread crumbs on top of the stuffed soles and put it back into the oven and broiled it for a few minutes to brown the tops a little bit (being careful not to burn the tops!). This was delicious, with plenty of sauce. I would make it again trying it with the yellow bell pepper. For a special occasion, I would use the lump crab meat.

I added a bit of garlic to the crab mixture. It was excellent. Restaurant-quality.

A nice way to get fish down small children. For that alone it gets my 3 stars. Add 1 for being so tasty and it got 4 thumbs up from our family. Enjoy. ps make extra sauce.

My guests loved it - I thought it was "ok" If I tries it again - I think I might put bread crumbs or ritz crackers in the stuffing - perhaps add garlic.

The delicate blend of the flavors of this recipe give it a perfect balance. The dish is not overpowered by any one ingredient. I couldn't get sole the day I made this, so I used flounder fillets (an excellent alternative). I made twice as much as we could eat, so I reheated the leftovers the next night at 350, covered again with the parchment and foil, for about 20 minutes. Possibly even more delicious the second night.
