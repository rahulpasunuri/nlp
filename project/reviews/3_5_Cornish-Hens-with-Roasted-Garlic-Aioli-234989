This was delicious. The aioli alone was worth the effort. String is optional, but makes a more attractive presentation. The high temperature leaves the hens crispy outside and juicy within. There will be lots of leftover aioli, but it's good on other things too.

I loved this dish. I will absolutely make it again. The ailoi sauce was so delicious and it went well with my rice. I rubbed olive oil all over the hens so the seasoning would stick.

This recipe is simple, fast and delicious. Roasting the garlic for the aioli is perfect.

OK, so here's what I did: I roasted the garlic and mashed it with some diced orange zest (I was eating an orange as a snack, saved some of the skin as I was workin' through it). Then I massaged that mush onto the cornish hen body; I took the skins off (trying to cut down fat content) after tying the sucker shut (stuffed with a lemon chunk & a widely/coarsely chopped celery stick) and put that in a pan in which I had roasted the foil-covered garlic bulb; thus it was already heated, and I put a wee bit of olive oil in it while finishing my hen prep. Roasted the hen 30 min, flipped it halfway through. Covered in foil to rest while combining a bit of white wine and chicken broth and thyme with pan drippings and returned to oven. Came out perfectly moist 'n juicy. Flavoring needs tweaking for me, personally, but otherwise nice subtle garlicky-citrus hints.

Delicious. Will definately make this again. Even my children loved this. The aioli was very good and will be using it for other things too.

We rubbed a little olive oil on the hens, and the oil started to smoke and imparted a slightly acrid taste to the skins. (Next time we'll use a little butter, or baste with pan juices.) Other than the oil, which was our addition anyway, this was an excellent dinner. (The aioli, in particular, was so good, not only with the hens, but with vegetables. It definitely will not go to waste!)

Easy and delicious recipe. The roasted garlic aioli was a huge hit and the leftovers were used as a condiment on veggies and in burritos the next day. For the hens, I rubbed the skin all over with olive oil before roasting and, with half a lemon left over from the aioli preparation, squeezed that over the hens after they'd been roasting about 5 minutes. This skins came out crispy but not dry and the lemon juice complimented the aioli.

I grilled the hens (after splitting them) on indirect heat. used about 1/2 of the recommended mayo for the sauce. This makes a nice summer dinner.

We thought this was very good! The hens had crispy skins and the meat was moist and tender. The aioli was a nice touch--I warmed some french bread and we used some of the sauce, especially the roasted garlic bits, on the bread as well. We'll have this one again!
