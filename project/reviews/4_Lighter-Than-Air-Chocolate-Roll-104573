This cake is OK, but it's fussier than it has to be. I usually use a chocolate roll recipe from a different cookbook, but I didn't have it while staying at a friend's so I tried this one instead. My usual recipe calls for cocoa instead of melted chocolate and it's a lot easier to mix up. The chocolate seized up when I melted it (my research says that's what happens when chocolate touches water as it's melting). It smoothed back out when I added it to the yolks, but it was really stiff and hard to mix in to the whites, so my finished cake came out speckled. I suggest beating the whites first, then the yolks and chocolate. It saves one round of washing, and any volume the whites lose while they are sitting is more than made up by what they don't lose in the mixing step when the chocolate is fresher and more fluid. The finished cake cracked in places where it was spread a little thin, so I had to trim about 1/3 of it from the end and sides. For the filling, I split the difference and used 2 tablespoons cocoa and 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier in the whipped cream.

Wonderfully easy cake and so delicious and light. My teenage daughter made it unsupervised a few years back (before I did), and that's how easy this recipe is. None of ours baked over the years have cracked while rolling. We vary the recipe by using chocolate or hazelnut mousse to substitute for the whipped cream filling. Divine! This is now a family favorite and so quick and easy. When served to family or guests, everyone loves it.

Great cake. I make it for a yule log for Christmas eve dinner and it always just disappears. It's amazing it does crack a little bit while rolling but it turns out just fine because you cover it with yummy chocolate buttercream!!

Made a double recipe and baked it as layers. Firmed them up in the freezer overnight and then filled with whipped cream. It was an amazing Passover birthday cake for my husband, much more interesting that the usual flourless chocolate cakes.

This was pretty good, but I think it would have been better if I'd used better chocolate. I had some good but slightly out-of-date chocolate in the back of the cabinet and used that, and I think the slight staleness made the cake taste a bit too dry. I also had problems rolling it -- it cracked all over the place -- but I'd never made a roulade before so again I figure that was my mistake.

I am surprised by all the negatives here. We've made this three times now, each with splendid results. My teen-aged son made the first one with minimal supervision. In all three, we have used Chambord and wild black raspberries in the whipped cream. The cracking wasn't severe and the cake plated well with more raspberries as garnish.

This was my first roulade cake ever - and it was easy! I rolled it up while the cake was still slightly warm and there were no real cracks (though the damp paper towel had lifted some surfacing). Consequently, this cake looked EXACTLY like a tree trunk. If you're aiming for yule log - perfect. But it wasn't the prettiest birthday cake... nonetheless tasted great. I used just vanilla extract for the whipped cream. (As other reviewers stated, having room temperature eggs makes it so much easier to merengue them.)

I followed a reviewer's suggestion and substituted kahlua and instant coffee grounds for grand marnier and orange rind. The results were very pleasing. Overall, this recipe is a bit messy but definitely a crowd pleaser!

i haven't made this yet, but am considering it for later this week. reading the reviews, and then the recipe, i noticed there are directions for room temperature eggs. this is extremely important, so be sure to let your eggs sit for about an hour before using them. ;)

This tasted great, but presentation was awful, and I've made many roulade cakes before. There was too much filling and the cake cracked too much when it was time to roll it. I've had better luck with other recipes in which you roll the cake while it's still warm, rather than letting it cool flat. Cake was nice and light. Filling was nothing special.

This was delicious and got 4 forks from all of my guests! It was easier to make than it sounds, and came together well. For the cream, I doubled the cream ( 2C) and used 4T brown sugar and 3 T Kahlua - great combination!!

This recipe was easy and the results were fantastic. We baked it in a 9 1/2 springform pan as suggested at the end of the recipe rather than a sheet pan, and spread the filling on top. Delicous and light in texture. I'll defintately be making this again.

I wanted to make a cake for a party that wasn't gloppy with frosting and this one was perfect! Guests called it "a light tiramisu", which is quite accurate. I flavored the filling with orange zest and Amarula (an African fruit liqueur) and it was delicious. You could really use anything that complements chocolate - very versatile. My cake "folded" rather than "rolled", but that was my own impatience...

Rating: 4
This was excellent but far from "lighter than air". I did the full 8 mins of yolk-beating with my hand-held blender and beat the whites until stiff peaks, but the texture was decidedly fudgy and rich. Wonderful, just not as I expected from the name. I used the cream/cocoa/vanilla filling as I was making this for kids. Both 3-year olds cleaned their plates and the adults had seconds!

This cake was excellent, it was light and delicious, I used the variation of the chocolate whipped cream, everyone loved it and I have requests to make it again within the week. I made a quick chocolate ganache and drizzled it on top.

I'd give it 4 forks, but as a previous poster mentioned, the size is more dimunitive than one might expect. It looks much nicer plated than presented on a dessert tray. I've made it twice now, and I think it tastes better slightly chilled, on the next day.

Fabulous, and surprisingly easy. Got me called a Goddess by my husband. My pan was bigger than what was called for, but it was no problem at all. I used slightly more whipped cream, did the cognac flavoring we really do love it. I may try the coffee next time.

This is a WONDERFUL dessert - better than ANY of the "chocolate logs" you can buy - even at the best bakeries. So much deeper chocolate tasting, and the Grand Marnier and orange in the whipped cream will make your friends swoon. Here's the problem, the roll looks a little diminutive on the plate - - especially if you are making it for more than 6 people - - And it definitely needs more whipped cream. For a party of 12, I baked two cakes and then rolled them together into a single "log". Used nearly 3 C. whipped cream, and tripled conf. sugar, Grand Marnier, and grated orange rind. Did not use any additional topping other than the sifted cocoa. It looked wonderful, got RAVES from the group, and there was nothing left but crumbs.

This was fantastic! I was looking for a recipe for the Chocolate Butter Roll that we used to have at family holiday dinners when I was a kid, and this takes the cake! It is super easy to make (but you must follow the directions perfectly...) and it does take a bit of time, but well worth it. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner, and everyone was on the floor - they couldn't stand how FAB it was!!! I did make a ganache and cover it (like the old chocolate butter roll I was used too), and it was even better. It does crack when you roll it, but it doesn't matter! It is amazing. I think next time I make it, I will double the whipped cream, as I personally would have preferred a bit more in the roll (but it doesn't need it). Enjoy!

This is great, a classic. I have a few hints for those struggling w/ the eggs - I take my standing mixer and beat the yolks for the five minutes w/ the timer on. When it goes off I transfer everything to the luke warm chocolate bowl slowly. (Add the choclate slowly first, then transfer it back to the chocolate bowl.) Wash the beater and bowl in hot water w/ a good ammount of dish soap. You need to remove all oils. Oily beaters and bowls can ruin the peaking process. Then I rinse everything out and fill it w/ cold water. Let it sit a minute. Then pour the water out. I attatch the beaters w/ a paper towel protecting my hand. (So the oils in my hands don't tourch the beater.) Dry the bowl w/ the same paper towel and attatch to the base, add the egg whites and they beat perfectly every time. Remember that you have to get nice rounded peaks first then slowly shake your sugar in. If you want the cake to be moist take it out at the 15 minute mark. I put at least 2 layers of moist paper towels. The quicker the better. You'll love this one. Promise.

This was a big hit for Christmas Eve dessert - it has a light but almost fudgy texture and the orange flavored (used 1 Tbsp Cointreau) whipped cream was the perfect filling. I did not have the bittersweet chocolate on hand, so substituted 4 oz Girardelli semisweet and 2 oz Bakers unsweetened chocolate squares and that worked out fine. Rolled it with the filling 24 hrs in advance and served it sprinkled with the cocoa and powdered sugar mixture and drizzled with some chocolate ganache (that was left over from making the Double Chocolate Cake also on this website). Set orange slices dipped in chocolate around the cake - beautiful presentation!

I followed the Queen of Christmas' (a poster from below) recommendation to make this cake....though I haven't served it yet, I do have a few observations. One, use good quality chocolate. Two, the cake is very fragile, but don't freak out if it falls apart. It is very forgiving, but I did follow the Queen's advice and frosted it with a chocolate buttercream and turned it into a Yule log to cover up the cracks. On sampling the ends I cut off to make the log, I found the cake very dry and it definitely needs whipped cream on the side. I used the cocoa/vanilla filling as I was serving this to children, but I think it's too much chocolate -- a simple whipped cream (or liquor) filling would compliment it better. I think it will be well received when I serve it this afternoon, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Perfection! I fill it with a chocolate custard and chocolate, frangelico buttercream...cover with ganache and woweee. you have heaven. This recipe works well as a Buche de Noel.

This recipe is DIVINE! I have made it three times. I make 3/4 of the recipe and use a 9x13x1-inch pan. It is much easier to make than you would think, especially with the help of an electric mixer. I made the Grand Marnier filling once and the espresso-powder filling twice; I greatly preferred the espresso-powder filling. I also made it in a springform once (rather than rolling it). The roll is a much nicer presentation. The springform version kinds of sinks in the middle and, to me, doesn't look as nice.

I liked this recipe (everyone I served it to loved it). It was fun to make, since I've never made a cake roll before. I think this is a recipe I will play around with. I would have liked fruit in it. I'd either add orange slices or do a cherry/kirsch or raspberry/chambord filling next.

I used a smaller pan, which may be why the cake didn't roll properly and ended up looking more like it was just stuffed with cream. That didn't affect the taste though - perfectly moist and not too sweet

Although I have not made this specific recipe, I've been making the Dione Lucas Chocolate Roll Leontine for many, many years, and it is, by far, the best chocolate roulade around. The woman was a genius in the kitchen.

this was great! not difficult either, instructions just look long. i didn't have the exact size pan; mine was larger, but i just spread the batter to about 15x10 and it turned out fine. made plain vanilla whipped cream for filling and threw on a few fresh raspberries. its been 24 hours and we have nearly killed the whole thing.. excellent!

This was the first time I made a roll cake and this recipe was as delicious as previous reviews claimed. So yummy that I will invest in my own jelly roll pan instead of borrowing my sister's. It is very easy to make and most of the work is just to wash your mixer's beaters. I like the fact that it can be made 1 day in advance.

Although mine never peaks either but still turns out quite presentable. I have made it twice both on my husband's Dec 23 birthdays. Second time around I splurge on Grand marnier but the sides split open. It is very important to separate the yolks perfectly...!!

This recipe made me the Queen of Christmas. Everyone loved it. I used my own twist with this recipe though. I trimmed the edges, frosted it with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (found on the back of the Ghiradelli cocoa powder container), and dragged it through with a fork (making the frosting look like bark), sprinkled it with powdersugar (snow), garnished with a holly sprig and some chocolate leaves, and called it a Christmas Yule Log. The presentation was beautiful. I also didn't add the orange zest to the cream, so it was more subtle. I agree with using the best chocolate you can buy. I mean, come on! How much is half a dozen eggs, and some sugar? Splurge... Ghiradelli is worth it. And to the woman who said it was a chocolate omlet: that is why you have to beat the eggs. If you don't beat them, you will get an egg omlet. Follow the directions. Half of the cake is air. Hold out for the peaks!

I've made this cake about four times, now - and each time it comes out great. It's easy, tasty and so light that you don't ever get that overindulgent feeling that often comes after a long meal and a rich dessert. I highly recommend this recipe as a take-along for a pot-luck. Your friends will be so impressed with your baking genious ; ) Hint: You don't have to get a whole bottle of Grand Marnier to make this cake. Those little airplane sized bottles you can get at the liquor store are perfect for this recipe, and they only cost $2-3..

I was not happy with the results of this. It smelled like an omelet when it was baking. It tasted like a chocolate flavored omelet. Also, 1T was too much cocoa sprinkled on the cake. I used Ghiradelli chocolate. For the whipped cream, I added a little Baileys and instant coffee which ended up too sweet (my fault). I would not make again.

A smashing success with the chocolate whipped-cream option, baked in a springform. I agree with previous reviews citing the recipe's forgiving qualities, and it stored well (without the whipped cream topping) overnight, making it a runaway candidate for after-work entertaining.

Very very yummy & fortunately for me, quite forgiving. I didn't read the directions closely enough & mixed all the sugar with the eggs, I also only had 4 eggs (Somebody ate 2 for breakfast...) so I had less batter & this still tasted absolutely scrumptious!

I brought this to a friends house, having never made it before, and it was a success. It is actually very quick to make and the directions all work. I used farm fresh organic eggs which whipped up nice and thick and fluffy (alternatively yolk and white) and I assumed the cake benefited from it. There were 4 of us at dinner and only 3 slices left at the end, and the cake is supposed to serve 10 or 12! Also a very nice thing if you have gluten-intolerant friends as it has no flour and yet is not the typical, heavy 'flourless chocolate cake'. Also I would suppose for Passover!

This cake is definatly light. I use Grand Marnier and it tasted good. I will try instant-espresso powder next time. The cake was fun to make.

Absolutely delicious. I have made this cake twice. It is important to keep this cake moist before rolling, so do not omit the damp toweling. The liquor (I used triple sec) really gives a great flavor. I even added some to the chocolate instead of the water before melting. I also doubled the whipped cream so that I could frost the outside of the roll. If you do this don't add the cocoa powder as it muddies the whipped cream.
