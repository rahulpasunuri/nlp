These fries came out great. Nice and golden and crisp. I use to do the boil method and then fry, but that is no where close to these results.

Right on Ms. Belgium! The best fries I ever had were indeed Belgian fries. It's so nice to finally have the original recipe so I can make them out here in Finland!

I can't stand to fry, so I make "faux" frites that are even better. Follow the directions for the preparation of the potato slices, then toss them in a bowl and coat liberally with extra-virgin olive oil. Place slices on a large metal baking sheet, not overlapping, and bake for about 15 minutes at high heat (450 degrees). When they begin to brown, flip the slices over and continue baking for 5- 10 minutes more until brown and crisp. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately. The best fries you'll ever eat, and none of the mess of frying!

this was fun! we have never made fries before. they were crispy/crunchy, just like i like them! (although that could be modified). we don't have a "fry daddy" so we just used oil in an iron skillet, and a thermometer, but it turned out great. we found that the fries were done a little sooner than the recipe leads one to think, but it's easy to control that, play it by ear.

Simple, yummy, and great accompaniment to steak au poivre.

Frying them twice is a must! Next time, I'll probably cut my fries a little thicker and leave them in a little longer to get the perfect crispiness outside without sacrificing the mushy inside that I love.

I made these fries with dinner and my husband and I couldn't get enough of them. I totally agree that soaking for about 15 min before, using peanut oil and twice frying really do the trick. they are some of the best fries we've ever had. Can't wait to make them again !

These were delicious! I agree with the other reviewer, the second batch was much crispier. I decided to use sweet potato instead of the regular ones, and the results were fantastic. My boyfriend and i devoured them in seconds! With a little homeade ketchup...Yum!

Fantastic, delicious french fries. I used the peanut oil recommended in the reviews and I think this, combined with the twice-fried effect, might be the difference between these and the ones I used to watch my mom and dad fry when I was a kid. I used Lowry's seasoned salt (holdover from childhood) and they were just great. I think the key, aside from the peanut oil, is that the oil is too fresh to fry fries perfectly, so when you cycle it in two batches, you get the benefit of the finished product without having to make a batch of so-so fries first. (I seem to recall hearing the author of the book _How_to_Read_a_French_Fry_ explain something about fresh oil being too fresh to make perfect fries and this recipe seems to address that brilliantly.) Oh the bellyache I had after devouring them fries! So good, so easy. (Also, if you don't have a thermometer, I'd say it's Medium-High for the first stage and HIGH for the second, using a heavy anodized alumnium pan in this case.) Fantastic Fries!

Used peanut oil as suggested, and I'm sure that's what eliminated the smell/taste of oil as reported by earlier reviewer. Pre-soaked in luke-warm water for 15 minutes, and believe this did keep scorching to a minimum. Kept the skins on, and did do the double-fry method. The results were not great, but I suspect I did not have the oil at the suitable temperature. However, with hot oil, I'm always so leery of raising the temp too high. I'll try again though, because about half the batch was wonderful.

very good, it worked very well sprinkling the potatos with a little bit of seasoned salt before frying them. doing that they didnt even need salt at the end!

I agree with Ms. Belgium, they must be fried twice,however, fry them in peanut oil. Best fries ever. Sorry for those with allergies. J

Fries were greasy. Family didn't like. Save your time and throw some frozen fries in the oven

Just a few more hints for this recipe for even better results: 1: Leave the skins on and cut them fairly thin as suggested in the recipe 2: soak the cut potatoes in luke warm water for at least 15 min and pat dry (this removes some starch so they don't scorch) 3: After the 1st fry (3-4 min), let them sit on a paper towel until cool before frying again. 4: Fry at approx. 375F the second time and they are done when they start turning golden colored. Test for doneness (don't overcook/undercook)

I used russet potatoes and left the skins on-like Boardwalk fries-and I wasn't disappointed. These were great-just like what you buy! I don't have a cooking thermometer-and it didn't seem to matter-I just fried the first time with the heat as low as i could-but still frying, then turned it up to fry vigorously for the second time.

I have been cooking for forty+years and these were the best I've made in a long time. I used the Yukon Gold or yellow potatoes..they turned out crisp and firm..Thanks...

I have had the occasion to eat some delicious french fries in Belgium and on no occasion were they baked!! They were, as are those in this recipe, fried twice.

this recipe was ok

Wrong. Being a Belgian, this recipe hurts my feelings. It's all wrong. Good, crispy, golden French Fries are baked TWICE and that's the whole secret. You bake them once at 150 degrees CELSIUS, until they are still white/yellow (NO BROWN EDGES !!) but already somewhat cooked on the inside. Then you let them COOL OFF completely. Only THEN do you bake them for the second time, until they are golden. Follow this recipe and your French fries will be marvellous. Baking them only once makes for the English variant of fries, which are called CHIPS but they aren't nearly as good as the original stuff. Remember now: bake twice for french fries! Greets.
