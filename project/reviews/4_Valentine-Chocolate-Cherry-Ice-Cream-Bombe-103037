My guests raved over this dessert & no one believed I made it! It was fun to make and I used pomegranate sorbet to cut the sweetness. It was a hit!

Crowd pleaser dessert. Couldn't find chocolate sorbet so I changed the recipe up a bit and made a more simple version. I used vanilla ice cream with raspberry sorbet.

Made it for Easter Dessert. Loved it. The hot fudge was rich with the brandy. I will make it again. It is pretty easy.

This is very easy and impressive too. I used mandarin chocolate ice cream on the outside, coffee chip on the inside and vanilla chocolate almond on the center. (it turned out two ice creams wasn't enough and I had an extra whole - too bad to need more ice cream. :)

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day using his favorites: chunky monkey and raspberry sorbet. I am not a big fan of banana ice-cream so I cannot comment on that, but he loved it. I will definitely make it again with a flavor more to my liking. I followed a previous reviewer's advice and added a layer of fruit (sliced banana) in-between the two ice-cream layers. Soaking the fruit in brandy for an hour did the trick to keep them from getting "icky-frozen." All in all this recipe has great promise with all of the different combinations to be made. Especially if you have a family like mine who prefers ice-cream to cake.

So impressive! I softened the ice cream a bit too much, so I pressed a bowl into the center of the first layer, then froze to make a nice hollow spot for the second ice cream. Turned it onto a footed platter and drizzled with warm sauce. I only froze it for 6 hours and it was the perfect consistency. The next day, leftovers were difficult to slice.

This was a very fun recipe, it was very good but you can get creative with it and use any combination. Others are very impressed when they see it! Shhhh don't tell em its easy

This was good! Tip from my mistakes: freeze for two or three days beforehand. and if you add fruit in the middle, it won't freeze into hard icy chunks if you soak the fruit in brandy for an hour or so before you add it to the middle icecream mix part. I only froze my first one for three hours and the middle wasn't done, so the whole thing collapsed and slid off the tray and onto the table cloth on the first cut. I cried, everyone laughed, we scooped it up and ate it anyway and it was a raging success. Next time, it was perfect! My mistake will live in family history forever!! :-)

I love this recipe. I have made it three times -- once using the chocolate wafers and twice using Oreo chocolate cookie crumbs mixed with melted butter as the two crust layers. (The cookie crumbs can be bought in a box in the baking aisle at my grocery store.) I thought it was much better with the Oreo crust. I also changed the ice cream flavors -- Chubby Hubby one day, Java Chip the other two times, both with vanilla as the core. This recipe is definitely a keeper...

I made this for a birthday party using vanilla swiss almond and chocoate-chocolate chip ice cream, and I have never been praised so much for doing so little. The response was almost embarrassing! I would definately make this recipe again.

I made this for my friend's birthday and used her favorite ice cream flavors from a local diner (oreo cookie and jamoca almond fudge). It was a big hit, and got a lot of compliments for something very simple and versatile.

I've been waiting for an opportunity to make this dessert since I saw it in the magazine. I used chocolate ice cream with raspberry sorbet and I may crumble the chocolate wafer cookies next time. Lots of raves with this one!

This recipe halved very easily. I could only find regular cherry-vanilla ice cream, so I pressed chocolate chips into the hollow before filling it with the sorbet. Everyone loved this recipe,it will definitely be made again , although perhaps in a different flavor incarnation which I don't think would be to hard to contrive, i.e.vanilla ice cream with a raspberry center, coffe ice cream with a chocolate center........

Very easy to make and impressive. It was a perfect ending to our Valentines dinner. (I also used Ben&Jerry's Cherry Garcia and their sorbet.)

This was really easy to do! When my company saw it come to the table, I was informed I would never be invited to her house for dinner. It is so pretty. When i do it the next time, i will add more brandy to the sauce. Used Ben and Jerry, cherry garcia... great! Does feed 16 easily. Try it.
