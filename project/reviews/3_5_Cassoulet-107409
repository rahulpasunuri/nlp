A great recipe, with one caveat. 8.25 cups of water is WAY TOO MUCH. Start with 3 cups, and if necessary add more to just cover the beans. For more flavor, use all broth instead. I used lamb broth, and lamb sausage, and it's great (a good substitute for pork, if you don't eat pork.) Fresh duck legs work fine. I love the idea of rendering the duck fat, and using that to fry the bread topping. So delicious!

The cassoulet should be in the oven normally 1.5-2 hours. I guess it depends on beans, you can always add more liquid and continue cooking if beans are not ready. I find using fresh duck legs makes more sense to me, confit is nice, but starting from scratch in a dish you will be cooking for 2 hours is so much better. Just brown them before vegies and they will be just as soft and falling apart at the end as a precooked confit. It is all about duck for me in this recipe anyway, I know most of cassoulet purist will not like this comment. Presoak the beans in a salty water, aka "brine" them. That will give them very soft skins, very buttery.

There are a lot of technical mistakes in this dish. The bean soaking and cooking times are each too long. The skin-crisping instructions are murky and the results messy. There are way too many bread crumbs and the inaccuracy in the bean cooking produces entirely too much liquid. I made this on Christmas day with homemade kielbasa and locally prepared confit duck. Those two ingredients were the best thing about this dish. For the record, a cassoulet should be firm and moist, like a holiday stuffing recipe, but loaded with much more flavor and meat. This recipe produced a grayish-brown mess that had to be taken apart and re-baked for 40 minutes to get it closer to a cassoulet. Awful recipe.

A note to VB_Cook - Take it easy! Perhaps if one is going to correct the use of terminology of others, it would be good to have one's facts right before doing so. Both a sachet d'epices and a bouquet garni are PRIMARILY herbs; not spices. Yes. I know. Now I'm guilty too.

Delightful again. I can't understand why this ranks at 78%. Made properly, (largely) as written, this dish is awesome. My mod: rather than using dried white beans I get white navy beans in cans. I use about half of the water but the same amount of beef broth, and cook for about half the time. Aside from that, made exactly as written (except I didn't put the celery in my bouquet garni - no need; easy to fish out), and it is absolutely divine.

Absolutely fantastic. We were fortunate to be able to purchase fresh confit relatively cheaply, along with a Toulouse saucisson d'Armagnac and a fantastic French bacon (Oyama sausage on Granville Island has a Cassoulet 'Festival' in November, and bring in all the most perfect ingredients you could wish for). I added half a dozen strips of bacon to the beans as they cooked, then pulled the bacon out and removed the fat before assembly. It came out absolutely fantastic - easily the match for most of the Cassoulet I've had around Toulouse. enjoyed around

I've been an Epicurious user for over 5 years but no recipe has ever motivated me as much as this one to want to write a review. I made this dish after returning from a trip to Paris. I was fortunate enough to bring home some duck confit. The rest of the ingredients I picked up from Whole Foods, use only the best. As well, I added 1 lb lamb shoulder, which I let sit before cooking with a few whole cloves, in addition to the pork kielbasa and duck. This dish took more like a half a day to execute. My partner and I had the meal with a Grand Vin de Graves&exceptional.

It's very telling when a French recipe uses French culinary terms incorrectly. Spices tied in cheesecloth are a sachet d'épices, not a bouquet garni.

Wow, this did not turn out well for me at all. I simmered the beans until "just tender" as directed, but an hour in the oven wasn't enough for the meltingly tender texture I hoped for. The topping with the cracklings was sooo good before it went on top of the dish (and I added it right before going in the oven), but it got soaked up by the too-thin liquid and lost all its crunchy charm. I also didn't find the flavors to be very intense or concentrated. I'm very glad I decided to test this recipe before making it for a dinner party. Sally Schneider has a version of cassoulet in A New Way to Cook that simmers the beans with browned chicken legs, which are then picked out and discarded, and the beans are drained with the liquid reserved. Caramelized aromatics and white wine are then added to the liquid and it's then reduced down to a very rich and concentrated sauce that gives you a nice thick bean base for the dish. I will be using her method for my next attempt, along with this recipe's topping. Also, I prefer no tomato in the dish, although I note that Julia Child uses tomato, so I guess it's authentic.

Very flavorful. A lot of work but worth it. The beans need longer cooking time than the recipe calls for though.

After looking for the perfect Cassoulet recipe, I have found it. I was only able to get 3 confit duck legs, and it was plenty. Great suggestion to save bean broth. Fit nicely into a 9x13 pan. Much easier and less time consuming than Paula Wolfert's recipe which I tried earlier.

Forgot to mention that I did the whole thing from start to finish in my Le Creuset 5 1/2 quart - much easier than transferring.

This was a great recipe! I used canned white beans instead of dried because I am lazy. They turned out well. This is a great dish that everyone enjoyed. Can't suggest any changes that I would make if I were doing it again (which I will be!)

I make this every winter now and we love it. If you are in New York and can get to Dean and Deluca, they make fantastic duck confit legs, very meaty dressed with extra duck fat, which is exquisite (don't think about the calories). They are $$, but since the rest of the ingredients are cheap and this is a huge recipe, I think it's worth it. It does take longer to prep that the recipe states and I always have to reduce the liquid before baking. That's what intensifies the flavor, so it's important. This one is a real favorite in our family.

Delicious, but also expensive and time consuming. Definately for special occassions only. Next time I will use just muttong leg and add duck fat for flavor.

I wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer on here who said the cassoulet was not as good as the sum of its parts. I purchased duck confit and French garlic sausage from a local meat shop known for making exceptional meats, and the cassoulet was not really all that special.

Second time I made this recipe, and this time around I conjoined it with the recipe here from Michael Lewis. I used salted/smoked slab bacon instead of smoked sausage (awesome), and I replaced some of the bean water volume with a bottle of dry white wine. Also borrowing from Lewis, I browned a pound of meaty lamb bones in duck fat and then threw them into the simmering beans along with the duck bones. The sausage/breadcrumb mixture thus had some lamb flavorings, as did the beans. This added extra depth to the dish. I also used homemade duck stock, which I made after the last time I cooked cassoulet (I make my own duck confit as well from a recipe here from Tom Colicchio - easy and much cheaper than buying confit duck legs individually). I reserved the extra bean broth for reheats -- this is key if you want brothy/soupy cassoulet on subsequent servings.

The next day, it was a race to the fridge for leftovers! BUT - don't believe the "active time" - it took all day to make this recipe (though not all active time). Here's a tip - instead of confit, I used roasted duck legs purchased at Costco and it still tasted fantastic. Despite soaking the beans overnight, they were still tougher than I would have preferred. My mother suggested using canned beans next time - says you can't taste the difference.

I make this recipe a few times a year. It's the best confort food. Confit is hard to find and $$$. Sometimes I buy a whole duck, skin it, chop it into chunks and throw it in. I might miss a bone or two but no worries. Slow cooking ensures tender meat.

I thought this recipe was good, but the seasonings were not as effective as the Cassoulet De Canard listed on this site. The white wine is so essential for getting that cassoulet flavor. I used the quicksoak method for the beans and they were still not quite perfect after two hours - but I think I might have had old beans.

Delicious! I made this dish for the first time and it was wonderful! I and my two guests had never eaten cassoulet before, but if mine came close to how it is supposed to taste we are all now cassoulet lovers! I'll definitely be making this meal again!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve and it was a success. Making the duck confit the week before was a sure plus as far as time was concerned. I think the active time listed on the recipe is a bit unstated so allow a bit more. The beans took longer than listed to become tender. A couple of suggestions.....keep the bean cooking liquid !!! After the intial baking, the liquid yield was only about a cup on the bottom of the casserole. I used another 2 cups to moisten everything on the reheat. Note: The topping, crumbs, and duck cracklings will not be crispy after the first bake unless you leave it in the casserole and rebake it that way. My suggestion would be to make extra topping for sprinking on just before baking. It would help to use individual dishes but I don't think the depth of flavor would be the same....need all those goodies to meld together in a big pot. It was MUCH better the 2nd and 3rd times. I used smoked beef sausage instead of kielbasa and it gave a great taste to the dish. I would make it again for sure.

This dish was excellent. I could not wait to have the leftovers the next day! I did have to cook the beans longer than the suggested time. But, overall, relatively easy to make. Would definitely make this again.

Anyone who didn't like this dish either hates beans, duck, sausage or all three. It was relatively easy, absolutely delicious, very hearty and satisfying. Yes, full of calories, but loads of flavor and complex carbs. Finding already made duck confit is the key, and worth it!

It's probably a good thing they don't put the calories on this...I found it good the first night but so much better the next day.

I was looking for a good use of duck confit...this wasn't it. The other ingedients overwhelm the duck, it may be o.k. if your more interested in sausage then duck but otherwise I'd keep looking for a better recipe.

For a traditionally 'peasant' dish, this takes a long time to prepare; but it is worth all of those hours; MUCH more than 1.5 hours preparation time! It was perfect and a terrific buffet dish. Everyone raved about this one. Those who had never dared eat duck became converts; who doesn't like confit?

Wow! What an incredible dish. We used 2 jars of cooked cannelloni beans to reduce prep time then added more confit. Saved some topping for leftovers the next night. Definitely a keeper.

Amazingly delicious. Made this recipe for a family party with my cousin, and I have a new-found appreciation for duck fat... which they really should sell in separate little jars. I found the time in the kitchen was a bit more; a little over 2 hours for two people working in the kitchen (my cousin was chipping fat off the duck confit most of the time). This was one of this first really gourmet dishes I've made, so the experience in itself was very fun. Made with two kinds of French pork sausage (one hard smoked, one link) from the little specialty store where we got the confit, and just about doubled the bread crumbs to have some in a bowl at dinner -- there wasn't a crumb left. The dish still tasted good for lunch the next day, but the crumbs and especially the duck skin had lost its crunchiness -- for me, that was a huge part of its charm. Served with some crusty rosemary bread and a bottle of A to Z pinot noir (an indie cuvee out of Oregon's Willemette Valley, and one of the best pinots EVER!!!).

This was a huge hit for dinner with company. I even made my own duck confit a couple of days before, which was surprisingly easy. I used flageolet beans and chicken stock as I don't like beef, but other than that followed the directions. Served in individual bowls and there was not a drop left in any of them!

I was terrified of making this dish, but I had promised to make it as a birthday present, and am glad I did. The instructions were easy to follow, and the duck confit and sausage, bought from D'Artangan were fabulous. This is a great dish to make for special company. You can make it the night before (I did) and then put it in the oven the next day while enjoying your company.

Two years ago my husband and I went to France for the first time and my husband discovered cassoulet. Ever since we came back he's been pestering me to make it at home (and he never makes special requests!). So I've been on the lookout for recipes, but they always seem to start out "Three weeks ahead of time start making your duck confit...". I like a challenge, but come on! So I was delighted to find this fantastic streamlined version. Sure it's not what we had in France, but it was still dynamite. Rich and flavorful, and better on day two. The breadcrumb topping soaked in right away instead of staying on top, so I think next time I'll try reducing the liquid like the recipe suggests. On the other hand, I didn't think it was too liquidy and the soaked in breadcrumbs actually made for a great texture in the dish itself. I made it with duck confit from D'Artagnan and with a good smoked keilbasa. It also made a ton! We still have half in the freezer. Can't wait to defrost it!

A hit at my house on Christmas Eve! I made a double batch and froze half (freezing half of the bread crumb topping separately). The frozen cassoulet reheated beautifully.

I made this for friends on New Years Eve and it was wonderful, country French at it's best. I got the duck confit from D'Artagan and used a double garlic pork sausage from a local butcher. The crumb top was rich and crunchy and the consistency was perfect, juicy and flavorful. Served it with a Kent Rasmussen Pinot Noir. There were not many leftovers!

Granted, I made a few modifications, but overall I thought it came out too dry. My sister-in-law made a really great one once with kidney beans that was real juicy.

This dish is delicious! The outcome is dependent on the ingredients. A good sausage that stands up to the cassoulet is a must. I trimmed the duck legs and kept them whole after putting the trimmed meat in the dish. The breadcrumb topping is great and would be even better if served in individual bowls. I have been a big cassoulet fan for years but usually order it at various French restaurants (Bistro Jeanty by far the best in Napa!)due to the long prep time. This recipe is a great compromise on time and since my teenage daughters love it, I know it's a hit!

While not the most clearly written recipe I have read, this was considerably easier than any other cassoulet recipe in terms of time. However, it simply didn't have the depth of flavor I expected, nor the nice rich breadcrumb crusty top - maybe you just can't cut corners.

I made this for a crowd for dinner on Christmas Eve, and although it was generally well-received, it wasn't all that special. I followed the instructions to the letter, getting duck confit and garlic sausage from d'Artagnans in New York, but the whole seemed somehow less than the sum of its parts. It was a fair amount of work, particularly dealing with the duck skin and fat, and it wasn't inexpensive, yet the final results were fairly downhome.

This Cassoulet is superb.. It is a bit more time consuming than the recipe states, perhaps closer to 2 hrs with 2 people in the kitchen. We made it an event. Couldn't locate duck confit locally so used the legs of duck purchased in the supermarket. I served a spinach, goat cheese, cranberry salad with walnuts, along with a hearty 1998 Insignia red table wine. A warming December meal, well worth the time and effort.

In Julia Childs "The Art of French Cooking" the recipe for this dish is 3 pages and requires you to make your own sausage. And although it may be the quintessential cassoulet , Gourmet has created a fitting rival. For a recipe designed to serve eight, it was so popular that four of us left only a measly lunchtime leftover. In terms of wine, I took my advise from one of the wine merchants at Chelsea Market. She recommended two; a Domaine De La Renjarde 2000 which was inexpensive and a bit lighter than the Crozes-Hermitage 2000 . We also felt the Hendry Vineyard Pinot Noir 1998 our guests brought was quite nice. By the way I served only a green salad to accompany the meal and a light sorbet for dessert.
