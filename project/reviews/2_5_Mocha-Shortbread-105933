These were the greatest shortbread cookies! After eating only one, my boyfriend asked when I was going to make them again. I changed the recipe a bit. I doubled the amount of espresso powder as recommended by other reviewers. I also didn't divide the dough into three pieces and flatten as the recipe proscribed. Instead, I rolled it into about 1/2 inch diameter balls and flattened them with my hands. Baked about 12 minutes, these were exceptional cookies!

These are FABULOUS, BUT they are definitely missing the vanilla. The first time I made them, without vanilla they were sooo bland. Then I tried them again, this time with vanilla. WOW!! what a difference a little vanilla makes! They are amazing. Also, the trick to cutting them is to cut them AS SOON AS THEY COME OUT OF THE OVEN. (Another thing I learned through trial and error.) I have made these every year at Cristmas and they are the first cookies I run out of-- and I triple the recipe!!!

I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HOW TO CUT AT END WITHOUT HAVING THEM BREAK APART IN THE END. DID I OVERBAKE THEM? AS FOR THE FORK SCORING, DIP THE TYNES OF THE FORK IN COLD WATER AND PLACE SHARP END AT OUTSIDE EDGE OF COOKIE WITH FORK HANDLE POINTED AT TIP OF THE TREE, PERHAPS A REVERSAL OF HOW ONE MIGHT HAVE FIRST TRIED TO DO THIS. LOOKING FORWARD TO AN ANSWER ABOUT BREAKAGE CONTROL.

I too was surprised to read the reviews. Every time I make it I get asked for the recipe. I did it in a cookie exchange and then so did my friends. All seem to love this delicate cookie.

While I didn't have problems with cracking (make sure you score them before baking), these weren't all that spectacular. There didn't seem to be a strong flavor of either chocolate or coffee. Maybe try adding more of either or both if you're set on making them again. As for me: I wouldn't bother.

I liked the flavor and look of these cookies, though i also have trouble w/ the cracking. maybe you should cut them before they harden.

I enjoyed these cookies. However, I would recommend chilling the dough and using a cookie cutter instead of patting into rounds and scoring. When they came out of the oven, the recipe says to let cool & then cut into wedges but they all cracked and ended up looking messy.

These are a pretty cookie, but I think there is something missing, vanilla maybe? The icing definately helps, but without the white and semi-sweet drizzles, they are almost bitter. The do look pretty. I realized that I don't like crisp cookies though, so I probably won't make these again.

I was a little apprehensive after reading the other reviews, but I think these were pretty good. It helps if you can keep the dough thicker and evenly thick throughout so the edges don't get too dry and brittle. As for taste, it is just a shortbread, not very complicated, but as with some other things, the taste will depend on the quality of cocoa you use, there is a huge difference between "Hersheys" and Perignotti. I had trouble getting that nice little fork pattern around the edges too, no idea how to make that work. If you use a good bittersweet chocolate for the decorative glaze on top, it seems to add a good touch, both flavor and visually.

I find the other reviews interesting. I made these last year at Christmas and they were a big hit. Gave them as gifts and was asked for the recipe a number of times. We love them!

I thought this recipe had interesting possibilities, but I wasn't real wild about it. However a friend of mine who made it at the same time LOVED it. So, go figure...

I also found these cookies to be rather blagh. Not enough flavor to them even though they looked great. Skip this one, there are better cookies than these to be eaten.

These were pretty when done, but they don't do much for the palate. I followed the directions exactly, but they seem to have a slightly burnt taste. They do not appear to be overcooked. I won't bother with these again.
