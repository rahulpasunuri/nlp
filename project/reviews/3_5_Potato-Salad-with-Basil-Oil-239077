My basil plants were taking over my kitchen so I was looking for a way to do some serious damage to them. I had already made the basil oil then decided to check out this recipe. I liked it! I also added the green beans and will do that every time I make it. Mine was not bland. anyone having trouble getting flavor out of this recipe should remember that there are five ingredients you can easily intensify to your liking. Basil,vinegar, salt, pepper, and mustard. I am going to make it several times this week just to tweak it to perfection according to my taste. thanks

This one is going into my regular summar rotation. Loved it. Will try next time adding some green beans, as suggested below, which would be another variation of the typical Genovan dish that combines pesto, green beans and potatoes, which is quite yummy too.

This is absolutely the most nutritious and delicious potato salad I've ever made. I prepared it the first time (and doubled the recipe) for a 4th of July gathering. Everyone LOVED it! The following week I was at the same host's home for another party and brought a different potato salad (still vegan and tasty), but the host's dad was hugely disappointed. He'd been waiting for my arrival with this dish! LOL! He went on all day--both raving about this salad and wishing I'd brought it! I am actually preparing a batch for him now so he can take it on vacation tomorrow. Honestly, it's THAT good! The only thing(s) I do differently is 1) add a bit of minced garlic to the basil oil and 2) peel and chop my potatoes before I boil them. I am a vegan, but for you folks who are not, this is truly an exceptional alternative to artery- clogging, cholesterol increasing, heavily mayo'd and/or sour cream-laden potato salads. Do your heart and taste buds a favor and give this a try.

A fresh-tasting alternative to mayo- based potato salads. I cubed the potatoes before cooking, and cut the cooking time to 4--5 minutes after bringing them to a boil. Drain, then spread on a baking sheet to keep them from softening further. Fast and easy, and hubby loved it. This one's a keeper.

I have made this salad several times and really like it--a great change from a mayo based potato salad. I also like the fact that it does not make a lot and is very easy to halve for just my husband and me.

This potato salad was quick and very easy to put together. The mustard adds a nice bit of tang. I added some lightly blanched green beans which turned out great.

Very tasty. Would be good with a little Parmesan grated over. Agree with other reviewers that the potatoes were a little undercooked in places, so if your taters are large either cut them first or give them more time.

I made this for a baby shower. It was well-received, and I would make it again.

I agree that this is a nice change from the mayo-based salads, and I'm sure it's a lot healthier. Mine came out pretty mustardy, but I think it's because my mustard was strong. My biggest complaint, though, is that I should have cooked the potatoes MUCH longer. A lot of my potatoes came out hard, which I think is gross.

I really enjoyed this and so did my dinner guest. The flavors were just right, tasty but not overpowering. I don't know how anyone could find this "bland", and if so you could just add a bit more of the ingredients until there's enough flavor for your liking. I added a few extra dashes of the rice vinegar at the end. Will certainly make this dish again.

I made this for my family as an alternative to a mayo based potato salad. I used fresh basil from my garden, and it was very good. The flavor isn't bold, it is subtle and lovely for a hot summer day.

What a great recipe, not using mayo! The flavor was wonderful and everyone really liked this today. Will certainly make this often. PS...Makes up very pretty too.

This is a lovely alternative to traditional potato salad. I made it as part of a green dinner (not this green menu though) and people really liked it. The basil flavor is very good. Be sure to pack it down so you have enough!

Wow!! What a great change form mayo based salads. I made it early in the afternoon and refrigerated to let the flavors meld. I did take it out of the refrig and brought it up to room temp before serving it. I did not think that it was a time consuming recipe at all. Will make this one again!

With all the tasty ingredients, I couldn't believe how bland this was. No one really liked it. I followed the recipe exactly and I am surprised at the outcome, especially given all the rave reviews. I would probably make it again just to see if I did something wrong, but it is too time consuming to bother.

Wonderful! A healthy spin on traditional creamy potato salad. The flavors were strong and tangy and worked well for summer time. This dish was a great way to use up some of the basil from my garden!!!
