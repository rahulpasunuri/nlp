I used this recipe for the dressing and just put it on Romaine with Parmesan shavings and a piece of fried bread. When I first tasted the dressing, even after letting it sit for a while it didn't taste enough like a Caesar for me so I tripled the anchovy paste, but I like the slight fishy note in Caesar. I also couldn't get a good paste, so mine may have had too much filler in it to have good results. But it was delicious. Really let it sit for a while at room temp to get the flavors married.

Well, huh. I didn't make it to the letter but followed pretty closely- my results were not what I'd hoped for. I think my mistake was that I used a stone ground mustard with horseradish which overwhelmed all the other ingredients. Also my dressing was very thick and I ended up thinning it down with water. Also didn't like the texture of the dressing. Perplexing, because my take on just reading it through was that it was going to be fabulous. Not sure if I will try it again. My goal was for something as tasty as the Tyler Florence version of Caesar dressing but without raw egg, garlic breath and plus a bit thicker texture. No dice.

I always keep a large jar of roasted garlic in the fridge, and used the garlic oil instead of olive oil for added richness of flavour. Easy roasted garlic: In a medium saucepan, put peeled garlic cloves (10-15 heads worth) and cover with plain vegetable oil (about 2" over the top of the garlic, but at least 3" from top of saucepan for safety's sake). Heat to bubbling, and roast over medium heat until rich golden brown. Remove from heat and let cool. Store roasted garlic in jar in fridge, covered in oil. Store remaining garlic oil in another jar for other uses (sautée vegetables, stirfry, vinaigrettes, etc.).

Roasted garlic dressing was delish and refreshing - and the croutons were surprisingly easy to prepare. I used some of the extra roasted garlic cloves to spread on the extra baguette I had bought.

I've made this several times and my guests always compliment it. The roasted garlic dressing is delicious. I add a little salt to the dressing and top the salad with some freshly ground pepper. I use a little less cheese than asked for, and I usually just buy the croutons to top it. I definitely recommend trying it.

I make this recipe several times a year. I suggest forgetting about the endive and just using Romaine lettuce. The home-made croutons provide a tasty touch.

An interesting idea to roast the garlic. Too sweet a taste for us, not to be repeated. Some things just shouldn't be tampered with, Caesar salad is one of them.

Wonderful! The vermouth added to garlic before roasting - YUM.

As an often lazy cook and an always picky eater, I forgot the anchovies and the homemade croutons. Just add more cheese, some crushed saltine crackers (not cool, you may say) and some leftover shredded chicken breast. SO GOOD!!!

Divino...! I roasted the garlic heads in olive oil and a little water...no vermouth necessary. This delicious, velvety sauce made by the addition of the roasted garlic is sumptuous..... I didn't have anchovy paste so used six anchovies from a can. I chopped them up and added them into the blender and they pureed perfectly..... Definitely a keeper....

Wonderful, smooth, tasty, love the garlic dressing and the touch of rosemary. I don't care for endive, so I used very little, next time I won't bother - it is great with romaine.

This dressing is great! The idea of using mashed roasted garlic to thicken the dressing was inspired. The generous amount of garlic suits me fine, but I think it's mild enough for a non-garlic-lover. Also good for people who are put off by the idea of raw egg in the traditional Caesar dressing.
