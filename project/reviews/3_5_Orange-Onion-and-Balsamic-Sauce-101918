This is a great and easy sauce, but I would strongly recommend pureeing it. The color of the sauce is brown, the onions become brown, long ...and kinda wormy looking. But throw it in a blender and it would work great on pork or chicken or even on a sandwich as a spread.

A cup of apple juice mixed with some lemon juice works just as well if you have nothing else in your fridge.

I rediscovered this recipe only last night, and it was just the thing for two thick sirloin steaks I bought for husband and me. I so disagree with the reviewer who advised it for fish and poultry. This is a zesty, strong sauce and NEEDS red meat (or maybe gammon or ham)! I decided to use honey instead of sugar, and ended up using about 6 Tbsp, as my orange juice was not very sweet. (I am in South Africa and our fruit juices do not have added sugar, just de-flavoured grape or apple juice). I did simmer it until the sauce was thickened slightly, and I also used quite a large red onion. At first, tasting it, I thought the taste too overpowering, but reduced and a tablespoon or more put on each steak was simply perfect. Great -- different, too. Will definitely make it again, because it's so easy.

This is just delicious. Have made it a number of times and now like to also add whole garlic cloves to it and pour it over a pork roast to savor. Simply fantastic. Family and guests want the recipe and also want me to make it again and again!

Easy to make. This makes a good appetizer warmed up and thinly spread on rye toast with melted gruyere cheese.

This is really fast and easy. Do not make this sauce with lamb or beef please. Needs poultry, pork (best) or robust fish. Served with roasted root veggies and steamed green beans with pecans. Sweet potato puree would be good to but I did not feel like going back to the store (drives me CRAZY).

This recipe is simple and tasty. I had it with lamb chops which wasn't the greatest match. I think I'll try it with pork next time.

I've made this twice now, both times with baked chicken breasts, and everyone always comments on how good it is. It is so easy, I'm sure I'll make it again.

I tried this on bronzed fish and it was incredible. I make this all the time now, and everyone seems to like it.

This is wonderful!!! I made a dish similar to this several years ago, lost the recipe and have been looking for it ever since. Glad to have it again. I think that the portions are too small--I made six times the recipe for about 10 people, and could have used more. I added some fresh herbs (at the end, after it was almost finished cooking). I've used rosemary and basil, and both are great. Thanks!
