I've made this a few times, but most recently when I made it I didn't have watercress available. Instead, I used a combination of purple basil leaves and mint leaves, cut into very thin slices (chiffonade) to top each appetizer portion. It was GORGEOUS! Fabulous for a New Year's Eve party or other celebration because the topping looks like confetti. It's great to have a low calorie alternative for parties any time of year.

Super easy and a delicious but unusual combination. My guests were very impressed and they disappeared quickly.

Yuck! like apples, like smoked fish, like watercress....but not together. Easy and elegant looking, but no one ate it.

I've learned that I am not all that fond of smoked trout, and I really don't like watercress. I will stick to smoked salmon and basil!

Great starter for any dinner. Elegant and easy to put together. The flavors went together beautifully. Even used the leftover trout with scrambled eggs the next morning. Delicious!

This was the first course of my elegant and easy dinner party. I included a simple horseradish sauce on each plate. Everyone loved this dish. It is a great combo of flavors.

Yum. This was easy and elegant. I doubled the recipe and had some ingredients left over. Even the next day, the apples were crisp and made a nice salad with the trout and watercress.

I was surprised how good this was, given how simple it is. I do think the trout made the dish and that it wouldn't be quite as good with smoked salmon, so look for smoked trout if you can!

I was looking forward to this from the rave reviews, unfortunately, I found it awkward and boring.

The best thing about this is that the taste combination is unusual and yet it is very fresh. I served it with a table full of standard nibblies and it wasn't touched because I think people didn't know what it was. When I offered it around though, people went back for seconds. They asked me what was in it and couldn't believe how simple the ingredients were. It took me about 2 minutes to prepare, so is a good quick thing to do.

This dish was very easy to prepare and went over well with my guests. I could not find smoked trout, so I used smoked salmon instead. The contrast of flavors between the apple and the salmon were really very well balanced.

Unfortunately I did not have smoked trout to use, so I used smoked salmon instead. Not only does it look great, but the taste combination is fabulous! The recipe couldn't be easier!
