This came out great, very nice recipe. I followed the suggestions to make 1 Cup of the flour wholewheat. I was looking for a walnut bread that can be sliced thinly for making pear/blue cheese sandwiches, so I didn't want the onions. I omitted those & increased the nuts to 1 Cup, which worked fine. I did use the food processor but the dough is sticky & really clung to the blade. Don't see why a bowl & big wooden spoon wouldn't work fine, the way I make all other yeast breads. If pears aren't available, at least do try this spread with a mix of butter/blue cheese or soft cream cheese/blue cheese.

I have been making this wonderful bread for many many years. I highly recommend using a cup of whole wheat flour - the original recipe in the Best of Bon Appetit cookbook calls for that, plus it calls for slashing the tops before baking.. FABULOUS bread!!!!!

This is a fabulous recipe and very easy. If you have any left after the first serving, it works well for paninnis. My new favorite

Very tasty, savory bread. To accommodate a dietary request I used margarine instead of butter and water instead of milk. Even with the substitutions it came out beautifully, everyone loved it, and it was quite easy to make.

In a perfect world this would have a chewy crust and firm crumb, but it's pretty good as a soft bread. The onion flavor is subtle and I think that kneading in rosemary would help the finished product. The bread slices well and will make killer toast and sandwiches.

I so wanted to try this but no onions, shouted the family, so I just did the whole thing, sans onions. Slightly dense bread, but oh my ... delicious anyway, I think it would have been better with the sauteed onion in butter. Couldn't have done anything with it (sandwiches) since they were devoured by said family, hot from the oven, with lashings of butter (and honey/jam). Will include onions for me, next time. Good one.

This is a wonderful recipe. The bread is very easy to make and it tastes fabulous. I've taken to making it for all our dinner parties.

So good. I served this at a party and everyone loved it. With its savory flavor, this would be excellent on a sandwich -- but it simply won't last that long, because fresh out of the oven it is heaven.

This bread is really great. I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one of cups of flour and it lended the bread a heartier taste and texture. While not the healthiest bread out there (there is a lot of butter), it certainly is wonderful. I also did not wait for it to become room temperature -- hot out of the oven with some butter makes the bread 4 forks...
