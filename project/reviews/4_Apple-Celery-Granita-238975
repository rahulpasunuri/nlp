Wonderfully unique recipe. I searched for this because I had a WONDERFUL lunch at Bouley in New York where they put a little apple/celery sorbet similar to this atop their gazpacho... it was wonderful.

Har don't be naughty cook from cupertino -- no comment on the crushed pills lol but I have to agree this was a suprisingly delicious dessert. At first I thought "celery in granita"?! -- but have to admit it was cool, refreshing and wonderful.

i made this without the wasabi (sorry, cant stand it) and with regular salt and it turned out very well. a surprise, but delicious. i have to admit it was the first step that intrigued me about this recipe: "crush pills with back of spoon into powder." many good nights have begun that way :-)
