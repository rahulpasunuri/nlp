My family loved this dish. This was very good, and not hard... though it's worth starting early as it takes time. The gnocchi get sticky, so use plenty of flour in the 'forking' part. The sauce is very good and very easy.

I just read about "ricing" potatoes with a cheese grater's large-holed side (I don't own a ricer either :)

The sauce is absolutely delicious. I had a problem with the gnocchetti though- I did not flour enough and some of them clumped together before cooking. Also, they were a bit mushy. Perhaps they need more or less cooking time.

I live just an hour south of Rome (stationed here, US Navy) and the recipe is an excellent one. However, it seems to be missing red pepper flakes which I added while sauteing the garlic. I have always had this a little spicy, especially at Il Matriciano, the authoritative restaurant in Rome for this sauce (amatriciana). They serve it with bucatini, but I prefer it with sardinian gnocchi (gnocchi sardo) which can be bought in a bag as it is more like pasta than gnocchi. Buon Appetito!

I don't have a potato ricer :( Will it be okay making this with just a standard potato masher instead? Or maybe using a mixer and beating the potatos?

I made this without the gnocchetti, simply used penne pasta. What a great dinner. I was wishing I had more company this evening.

Actually didn't make the dumplings, but made the sauce and served it on penne. The sauce is OUT OF SITE!!! My husband and I both loved it. Next time I will try the dumplings also.

I have just successfully made this recipe and there was no problem with the gnochetti falling apart. This is possibly because the potato starch contained in the potatoes helped to keep them together. I didn't bother to roll them off a fork as this took to long - i cut them, then gave each one a quick roll in my floured hands. My partner commented that the flavour and consistency of the gnochetti was exactly as he would expect it to be in a good restaurant in Italy. Follow the recipe exactly and you can't go wrong!

I've made potato gnocchi without eggs and they don't fall apart.

I have not tried this receipe. I see a problem. For the gnocchetti.the receipe should call for eggs or potatoes starch ,if not the gnocchetti will fall apart when cooking. There is nothing to keep the potatoes and flour togheter.when cooking in the boiling water ,it will fall apart.
