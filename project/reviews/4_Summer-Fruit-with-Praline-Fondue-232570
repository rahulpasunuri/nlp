OMG OMG OMG this was yummy and very easy to prepare! Used 1/2 the rum called for. Served this as dessert at a fondue party and it disappeared in seconds. My guests are still raving.

A big hit. I've made for book club and tennis league multiple times this summer. Easy to put together and when in a crunch I buy the butterscotch. Rarely leftovers.

This was quick and easy. The kids loved it and started dipping popcorn once we ran out of fruit. Next time I make it for them, I will leave out the rum and only add the vanilla. I think they will like it more that way.

This was AMAZING. The only thing was, I found the butterscotch sauce didn't stick to the fruit very well. That's okay, I dipped into the creme fraiche first, then the nuts, and THEN the sauce. Soooooo good.

Living in Australia means that we have Christmas in the heat of summer and the prime of summer fruit. After having a big "traditional" Christmas dinner, everyone loved the beautiful summer fruits dipped in what the kids claimed should be called "ButterRum" sauce instead of ButterScotch. This was so easy and with peaches, cherries, plums, grapes and mango, it was hard to say which fruit tasted the best with the sauce, nuts, and DOUBLE THICKENED CREAM. This will become a summer BBQ favorite.

This was easy and delicious. I used clotted cream instead of creme fraiche. It was yummy over ice cream and heated up easily in the microwave the next day.

Easy and just right for summer. Praline fondue was easy and delicious. I served with chopped almonds and chopped pecans. I used Mexican crema fresca, table cream and it was good.
