Looking for something to do with extra parsnips and celery. Wow this was really tasty. I was sorry I only made a half batch. Did not want to go to store so I subbed yellow onion for green. Used whole bunch of celery - leaves and all. Did not have matzo - found a simple recipe using panko bread crumbs. Added a dash of ginger & pepper, and fresh dill. Easy and better than my last attempt at matzo balls. Soup was great without the matzo balls too! http://glutenfreewithjudee.blogspot.com/2011/09/fabulous-gluten-free-matzo-balls.html

this soup is great! Based on mixed reviews about the soup, I made some changes: roasted parsnips and some of the celery with a whole garlic 350 for 30 mins. I made the matzo balls, and I thinned the soup with the broth I cooked them in ( a couple chicken boullions). I was super yummy. the soup had a supple, creamy consistency and the matzo balls were great (I used fresh ginger). I added some red pepper and sugar to the soup for some zing. Loved it and I don't even like parsnips that much!

Terrific flavor. I made this as written and my family loved it. Did not use the matzo balls (this was just for a regular dinner, and we are not kosher) but topped with blue cheese and chopped toasted walnuts as another reviewer suggested. Those elements added key flavor & texture. A good soup without them, a GREAT soup with.

This soup was absolutely perfect for my seder. It was different than the standard chicken soup and the green onion-dill matzoh balls were amazing. I used a hand blender to make things easier but made sure it was smooth. Everyone absolutely loved it! Great parsnip flavor. Will definitely make this again!

I love this soup. I searched for a celery parsnip soup recipe after enjoying it on a regent's cruise - known for the quality of its food. I made a few changes to this version and it tasted just like the soup I had on board. I am making it again as I type. Changes: I used homemade vegetable soup stock rather than chicken stock. I also roasted the celery and parsnip for 25 minutes at 350 before proceeding. This did two things. It enhanced the flavor of the vegetables and it allowed me to use a larger (less time consuming) dice. I did not use the Matzo balls. I did sprinkle with blue cheese and roasted walnuts. Delicious!

I have been making this soup every year since it was published in the magazine. I think it is a great spring time soup, which is nice change from the traditional broth base. The parsnips are added to the soup to add body without color. Try to find the freshest ones you can, so that they are not bitter. The matzo balls are great.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to give this soup a try as an alternative to the usual chicken soup with mazto balls. It was not all that easy to find parsnips which I had never used before. I made the soup exactly as directed and used a good quality organic chicken broth. Also made the matzo balls as directed. The food critics (husband and kids) were unanimous: the soup was so-so but the matzo balls were great. I won't make this soup again. I thought the parships had a strong flavor and that there was way too much celery.

This was a fabulous matza ball soup for a dairy seder. I used a combination of good quality vegetable broth and "non-chicken" chicken broth. The soup was very flavorful - don't leave out any ingredients. Make sure you puree it completely!

I made this soup for Passover last year, and will definitely be making it again!! Both the soup and the matzo balls are delicious - this is not your Bubbe's matzo ball soup! The soup alone would also be delightful as a "spring" appetizer for a nice meal.

I made this for the first time for Passover, it was ABSOLUTLEY fabulous! I followed the receipe exactly and received rave reviews, three people asked for the receipe, so quick and easy to make, the matzo balls were devine, this is a standard now for my Passover, Thank You!!!!!!

I wasn't crazy about this soup. I agree the matzo balls were good, but the soup itself wasn't what I was expecting. As already mentioned, it was wierdly sweet, very thick without quite a bit of additional stock, and had a rather unappetizing color--sort of like sewage. If you decide to try this recipe, make it for yourself first before serving it to company.

The matzo balls (mbs) were better than the soup (long gone are the mbs but the soup still sits in the fridge). I used half the amount of dill so the flavor was subtle. The soup had a hint of sweetness, which I didn't like, but it was good. I thinned the soup with 5 more cups of veggie broth, but it was still thick. I prefer a thinner soup with mbs. The ginger in the soup can be skipped but it was delish in the mbs. The soup was too time consuming, but the mbs were worth it.

I had the in-laws over for the first time. THEY LOVED IT! HIS GRANDPARENTS wanted to take home the left over matzo balls. THE best ever. I did cut down on the dill just a little. I WILL MAKE THIS OVER AND OVER. YOU MUST TRY IT!!!

This was a great soup!!!!! The combination of celery and parsip was creamy and delicious. Everyone loved it. My daughter invited her friend to come taste the (cold leftover) matzo balls and she loved them too.

This is a fabulous soup. I first made it three years ago, and have made it every year since then. Everyone who has had it has loved it... and has asked for the recipe. My mother-in-law now makes it at her seder too.

Best soup ever! Was told that it was restaurant quality. The fresh dill and other fresh ingredients made it very tasty and healthy. The matzo balls were not chilled for 6 hours, yet still came out very well!

I made this last year and everyone loved it. Several people asked for the recipe. One friend called me and said that her soup had the same flavor but wasn't as creamy as mine. Turns out she used a food processor instead of the blender.

Very flavorful and light soup with a gorgeous color. A nice and easy-to-follow recipe that I will certainly make again.

My first sedar - my first try at matzo ball soup. This is not your mother's soup! It was different, but wonderful. Even my parents liked it, once they got over the fact that it wasn't a "clear soup". Try it and enjoy!

I made this for Passover for 12 and everyone loved it. The soup is different but really tasty.
