One of my favorite Epicurious recipes. Big hit with the kids. I don't change a thing.

Rating: 3
I make this as an appetizer for parties and it's always very popular. I do make a few changes though. First, I use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain white, I add a few cloves of garlic to the marinade, and most importantly I let it marinate for several hours (overnight if possible) instead of 1 hr as the recipe suggests. I think this makes a huge difference in the flavor, having tried it both ways. I also use pecorino romano, which has a lot more flavor than parmesan. I buy boneless chicken tenders, broil as suggested once I coat them, and then put the skewers in after rather than having to soak to keep from scorching. Keep the chicken warm and drizzle the lemon butter sauce right as I serve them.

This is a delicious dish. I have made it several times and its one of the very few dishes my kids asked for again and again. I use plain, boxed bread crumbs and cut the chicken a little larger than one inch--more like bite sized chunks. I know this sounds strange, but this tastes like lobster to me--must be the lemon butter dipping sauce. The lemon flavor goes very nicely with spanish rice. We add a green salad--its great!

This made for a quick and yummy dish. I broiled w/o the skewers and served it over a bed of spinach topped w/ angel hair pasta, then the chicken and sauce. Next time would make more sauce, or stretch it out w/ white wine and/or chicken stock.

Very nice for a spring meal. Works fine using panko and setting on a pan rather than the skewers. Light and tasty.

We call this Crack Chicken in my house. Totally addictive. On my healthier bents, I've skipped the sauce and still been completely happy with it. And once you make more than three times, the prep time flies by.

I've been using Epicurious for a while now, and this is the first recipe I've found that I've been 100% disappointed by. I made this tonight for dinner and, honestly, I must say I am mystified by the high rating and glowing reviews. I added extra red pepper and lots of garlic to the marinade, and I still thought the chicken was unbearably bland. What is the appeal here? It's just not worth the calories, in my opinion. I guess I'm used to more complex flavors--but even my boyfriend, who likes his food on the plain and fatty side, agreed with me. Oh, well. Can't win 'em all, I guess.

This is a favorite epicurious recipe! I always omit the lemon butter at the end and still get moist, delicious results. Also use romano instead of parmesan and a little extra red pepper for some more kick. If I'm not opening wine to drink, I omit the wine with excellent results, as well.

Rating: 2
Nothing special; somewhat more work than is warranted by results; took 10-15 minutes to cut chicken up, another 10 minutes to coat. I agree with the reviewer who noted that quantity of bread crumbs/cheese was insufficient to coat all the pieces of chicken. This chicken is essentially "chicken nuggets" with lemon butter sauce; my children did not like the lemon flavor and didn't eat their portions. I prefer my old standby for parmesan breaded chicken from the Barefoot Contessa Family cookbook.

This was really tasty. I just made the chicken as chicken breast, not on skewers, and it came out just fine. My only complaint is that its not exactly the healthiest meal we've ever had. I think next time I'll leave off the butter (not that it helps too much). I think the taste will be just as good without.

This recipe quickly became a family favorite. I use panko for the breading and grill at very high heat, 3-4 minutes each side. The crumbs add extra crispy bits, and the lemon butter...mmmmm good.

This is a tasty and easy chicken dish. I added two cloves of minced garlic to the marinade and another pinch of red pepper to the breading. We grilled the chicken and it stayed on nicely. Served with whole wheat pasta and a green salad with stilton cheese, pears and pecans. I will make this again. Next time I'm going to brown the butter sauce before adding the lemon. And perhaps toss some fresh basil with the pasta.

Rating: 2
just a step above your standard "breaded chicken" recipe. Easy and liked by my pickiest eater, so it can't be all bad. I didn't see the need for all 12 bamboo skewers, I was able to fit them on to 7 skewers with enough spacing between pieces to cook properly. I also tossed pasta with broccoli and topped with sauce. Turned out well.

One of my standbys for weekday dinners! I skip the lemon butter at the end and use extra red pepper in the marinade to give it a little more kick. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly (right down to the cooking time) and it turns out great every time!

I like tossing the chicken and lemon butter sauce with some mini penne and steamed broccoli. It took a little tweaking to get just the right amount of sauce but the whole family loves it.

Substitute marinade: 1/4 C teryaki sauce, 1 T lemon juice, 1/4 tsp sugar, 1 tsp grated fresh ginger. Marinate overnight then proceed with recipe. Skewer with mushrooms and blanched green pepper. Delicious.

Thought this would be a good take for my picky kids. Hubby & I liked it, although it was a tad bland. The weird thing was that my kids didn't like it! Will definately tweak/spice it up if I do again.

I'm confused by all the rave reviews. This chicken did not excite me. Too bland and I even added a little garlic to the butter. Won't bother with this again.

Excellent! I added bits of prosciutto between the chicken pieces for an extra flavor treat. I don't think the butter is necessary though. I just sprinkled with lemon juice instead.

Very nice and simple. Using metal skewers instead of bamboo, this took about 13 minutes in the broiler. Will definitely make again.

This chicken was wonderful, everybody (family and guests) loved it, so crisp on the outside and tender and juicy inside. We have tried it both broiled and grilled and it was delicious either way. Perfect!

I liked this dish - the breading was very tasty. The reason I am only giving it two forks is because I dislike recipes that arent accurate. For example, it took much more than 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs to coat all the pieces of chicken. Second and more importantly - 8 minutes under the broiler! Ha! More like 30 and even then there were some pieces that were on the pinker side. Because this is a tasty recipe I will make it again but this time I will allot for the 30 minute cooking time. I served it with couscous and corn.

very yummy!

Perfect weeknight meal, it took approx. 10 minutes to prep and then about 10 to bake. I substituted panko for breadcrumbs and loved the outcome. Next time I might add more crushed red pepper since the butter does mellow the taste. Despite the ingredients, this does have a light feeling about it. I served with Garlic & Lemon Couscous.

Rating: 3
I've made this without coating the chicken in the breadcrumbs...maybe not as scrumptious, but better for us low-carb folks. Also, I find that the lemon butter is better and more lemony if you cook the lemon juice and let it reduce a bit, then let the butter melt into it instead of the other way around.

Rating: 4
really good.....easy...didn't make the sauce for the top and it was still great as a side to the pasta with white wine garlic sauce. I added garlic to the maranaide.

These were wonderful. It difficult at all to prepare and had a delicious outcome. My husband and I both loved them. The recipe says only 8 min on each side but I keep them in the oven for about half an hour,turning about every five min...I found this made them brown better and bring the flavor out more.

I made this for a party. It was a big hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. I made this on the grill instead of the broiler and it still worked well. Will make this again, especially since I am getting requests for it.

My family loves this recipe - easy enough to make for family but good enough for company. I usually cut the chicken breast in half rather than smaller pieces. We've been to Cunetto's Restaurant many times but never tried this one - will have to make another visit and see how mine compares.

Excellent chicken recipe. Easy and very tasty. I make this frequently and have found it is still very good without the lemon butter sauce if you'd like to save (a few) calories.

Well, given all the previous great reviews, I have to say this was a rather heavy way of preparing chicken. With the cheese in the breading and then drizzled in butter, it just felt like we were eating a heart attack on a plate and it wasn't so delicious as to make it okay to indulge. So, I don't think we'll be making this again. Just too fattening for our taste and we're usually pretty forgiving of that concern if the food is delicious, so we'll keep looking for better chicken recipes. By the way, we loved the GRILLED CHICKEN, RED ONION, AND MINT KEBABS WITH GREEK SALAD (from this site). They were outstanding!

Rating: 4
Hands down a keeper. I've been making this dish for three years and everyone I've made it for loves it. I usually marinate for at least 2-3 hrs. I serve it on a bed of brown rice with the sauce drizzled ontop, with a side of fresh steamed green beans. Be creative, use what you enjoy.

Rating: 3
Very good recipe. My ultra picky wife loved it and is already requesting it again. I followed the recipe to a 't' except I cooked it over a gas grill instead of broiling. I was already cooking other dishes outside and didn't want to bother with the oven. It grilled amazingly well. The breading stayed on, I got grill lines, and it cooked very nicely. Give it a try.

I've been making this recipe for years and never got around to writing the review. While reviewing another recipe I decided to give this recipe its due. I think it's one of the all time favorite chicken dishes that I serve. I don't know what the Cook from Dayton,OH did to ruin this recipe, but usually reviews one after the other stating how great the dish is, can't be all wrong. I usually have to tweek most recipes but this one I've never had to adjust unless it's salt and pepper to taste! No matter who I serve this dish to, there are always rave reviews and requests for the recipe!

This was EXCELLENT!I put chunks of lemon on the skewers with the chicken & added lemon pepper to the marinade. I did mine on the bar b que & the chicken turned a wonderful golden brown. Sensational.

I read all the reviews and thought the recipe sounded great, but it was easily the WORST chicken recipe I have ever made. Maybe I did something wrong, usually I love the recipes I find on Epicurious. Followed the recipe to the letter. Maybe I shouldn't trust the reviews anymore! Oh well, I'll keep looking!

While I enjoyed this dish, my boyfriend loved it. It is now one of his favourite ways of having chicken. Will definitely make again, most likely on a BBQ next time. I like the ease of preparation and the use of ingredients easily on hand.

Delicious -- though here in St. Louis we call it Chicken Spedini and every italian restaurant in town makes a very respectable one. Since you are clogging the arteries anyway, it is traditionally served with a side of pasta in a cream sauce (pasta con broccoli or Kemoll's -- another great local italian spot -- version with spinach, toasted pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes). YUM!

An incredible dish! Comes out beautifully every time! I've been making this dish for years and pass it on to everyone I make it for! I usually use White Zinfandel wine instead of dry white, and it makes it even more delicious!

Excellent! I deviated a bit and used chicken drumsticks, marinating for 2 hours instead of just one. Came out wonderful. I baked the chicken so the skin wasn't very crispy but the meat was very tender with a tremendous amount of flavor. I'll try broiling next time to get browner skin. A must try for any cook!

I have made this recipe many times in the last several months, and every time I have received lots of compliments. I agree with Mich D, the orange and garlic roasted shrimp are the perfect compliment and wonderful as well. This recipe, along with the shrimp, has become the meal requested most often by both my family and my husband's family when they are at our home.

Wonderful! Simple to make and the lemon butter sauce adds great flavor at the end. Made this skewered on the grill for company along with another great recipie "orange and roasted garlic shrimp skewers" and grilled baby portabella mushrooms and grape tomatoes. Everyone loved it and because most of it could be made ahead it allowed us to actually spend time with our guests!

This was so good! I also cut the chicken into larger pieces (I hate fooling around with skewers)and then put them on the grill. I cut this recipe in half for my husband and myself, served it with rice and asparagus. I'll definitely make it again.

Without a doubt, the best chicken I've had to date. Loved it, made it twice in one week! We did cut the chicken into larger chunks for the grill, that way we didn't have to waste the time putting chicken on skewers. This is going to be a mainstay in our home-easy to prepare and delicious. In a side note, we love Cunetto's restaurant, and stumbled across this recipe by accident. It was a most pleasant surprise, and my husband was familiar with this dish.
