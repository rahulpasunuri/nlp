Deeeelicious. Put it over pasta with a spoonful of goat cheese and some extra red pepper. Yum. Yum.Yum.

I have been making this recipe for several years, whenever I have tomatoes that start to turn soft. It's absolutely delicious served over pasta or polenta.

Good stuff. I actually used canned tomatoes and a lot less oil and it was great. Also, I soaked the anchovies in milk for a bit before using them -- I just do that every time I use anchovies for anything. I ended up pureeing this and using it as a sauce for crab cakes, as I despise mayo and am always looking for a good sauce that doesn't require it. Yummy, easy and cheap!

This was a wonderful dish. My kids said it was the best tomato sauce they ever had. I kept the anchovy secret in my head. I'll make this often. You could cut down a tiny bit on the oil.

Whoa. This was seriously wonderful. I used reg tomatoes in wedges and threw red potato chunks (with skins still on)at the other end of the pan with some of the mix on them as well. Cooked at 350 just cause I forgot about the 400 degrees. I dont think it took 40 min. What a great side dish for cedar plank salmon. Didnt tell hubby about the anchovies til he had licked his plate clean and he was very surprised!

Gave this 4 forks because, in addition to being delicious, easily resolves a problem of many roasted tomato recipes -- who has time to wait eight hours for a 250-degree oven to do its work? Slicing each tomato in six wedges means a 400-degree oven can concentrate the flavors in just 40 minutes without turning them into stew (the result of trying to do the same thing with halved tomatoes). And, like any good roasted tomato recipe, makes even the lamest tomatoes (the organic romas I bought in Trader Joe's were red on the outside, green on the inside! They'd been gassed! Boo!) taste like the handiwork of the most eco-sensitive heirloom vegetable farmer.

Used a Misto olive oil spray instead of 1/2 cup. YUMMMY!!!! Maybe that's why it was soupy for others, who knows?! In short, delicious!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. For its simplicity, the taste is wonderful. This recipe is a keeper.

This turned out too soupy and just... uninteresting. Both my boyfriend and I thought the idea was good, and it had a nice salty taste from the anchovies combined with a nice fresh taste from the parsley, but it just didn't come together as well as we expected. There are probably better recipes out there...

Wonderful! Perfect for summer tomatoes. I like to add capers, or substitute fresh basil for the parsley.
