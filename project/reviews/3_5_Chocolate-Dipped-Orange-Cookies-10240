Wow, these are amazing. Definitely a cookie that I will often make. Recipe does not make 36. If you are not a citrus fan, then you may not like these.

These were wonderful! Very light and delisious -- reminded me a little of Orange Milanos. I did skip the sprinkled on sugar, and didn't miss it. I will happily add these to my Christmas repertoire.

What a mess! The butter ran all over the oven, the cookies turned into crepe-thin messes, and it was just a disaster. Yes, I do know how to bake. This was a waste of ingredients.

I'll second everyone's opinion that this is a small recipe. Not worth making unless you double it. Otherwise, these are great light cookies.

I love this recipe! I only make it during the holidays because I would eat all of them myself if I wasn't forced to share. I double the recipe and even doing so, I never have been able to make 36 cookies (I'm counting the ones I eat along the way) Don't forget the pinch of salt!

My variation of this recipe has become a favorite at our house. My daughter and I make them every Christmas season without fail. I have adapted the recipe in the following ways: forget the cornstarch, up the baking powder to 1 tsp., use orange extract instead of grated zest and orange juice. I use a cookie press to form the dough into fingers. The granulated sugar is completely unneccesary. Just dip the baked cookies in melted chocolate...and Voila! they are fabulous.

This was my pride in a gift plate of cookies I made. I was at first intimidated, but it wasn't too hard. My tips for my pastry bag were too small, so I just used the hole in the cap. Kinda Milano size. Would like more finger size next time. I used the richer tangerine juice. I used the double choc. pieces. Having a deadline, I hardened the dipped cookie in the fridge for a half hour. Oh yes, that typo should read "cooled" choc, not cooked. Recipe needs doubling. This only made 18 "good" ones.

This recipe is not unlike my langue du chat recipe-and both are sort of a hassle. The real problem, though, is that the recipe reads "semisweet chocolate, melted and COOKED slightly". We all know that COOKING chocolate for dipping is a bad idea, but COOLING it slightly would be a wise move.

Tastes good, a bit of a pain to make. Didn't make enough cookies.

These taste very similar to the Pepperidge Farm Orange Milan cookie. They make a nice Christmas cookie--good presentation.

This recipe was nice, the cookies turned out to be delicious. What I didn't like was that it didn't turn out nearly enough cookies, I would double the recipe when making it a second time. Also, the dough is very sticky, you have to dip your hands in flour repeatedly.
