I really loved these cookies. I rolled almost 3in diameter logs and then rolled one log in candied ginger and one in sanding sugar. It was a different direction and a nice touch.

these are really lovely European cookies. Not too sweet, doesn't have a million chips. Simple, and can be made in proper, coin-shaped cookies sizes. Really nice sables.

Hint to cooks who complain that these are crumbly/short: That's what a SABLE is..basically a shortbread. These were exactly what a sable should be; buttery and light with a great cinnamon taste (I used Penzey's Cassia Cinnamon & replace it every 6 months)

If you like your cookies very crumbly, almost powdery in your mouth... then these are the cookies for you. The flavor was excellent, but i personally like my cookies moist and slightly chewy, the opposite of how these came out. I'd rather just eat the dough instead of baking the cookies!

This buttery easy recipe needs to be rolled/shaped to perfection before going into the fridge because it crumbles easily. Initially I made this recipe to give away but my husband got a taste, I will make more again very soon.

Delicious and buttery. If you are looking for a classic recipe for a wonderful cookie without all the frills and cloying sweetness of many more elaborate confections, this is it. Simple, but fabulous.
