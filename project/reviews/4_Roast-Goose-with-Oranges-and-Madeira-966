Loved this goose, though we didn't trust the cooking instructions. 3 hours at 162°C for a 12 lb goose seemed far too little. Even at 180°C I'd leave the bird in the oven at least 5 hours. But since we heated up the old wood-burning oven anyway, this didn't matter. The sauce is to die for.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner & everyone went nuts! It was delicious. Our family loves gravy. So, I doubled the sauce. It was perfect!

I would give 4 stars for the roasting instructions. The bird came out amazing. My guests loved it - many people wanted the recipe. Taking off one fork for extra sweet gravy and shallots. I read other reviews saying that it was too sweet so I didn't add honey and put some soy sauce and balsamic vinegar and made balsamic reduction sauce instead. It turned out great but I now can't remember what I put in it to adjust the taste. I would definitely make the goose again the same way, it came out with crispy skin and moist meat. Very delicious.

I thought I would try something other than turkey this year (especially since there would only be 3 of us eating),looked around and found this recipe with plenty of positive comments - foolproof. I followed the directions except adjusted the time down a bit because the bird was 10.5 lbs instead of 12.5 lbs. At the end of it all it was mostly inedible - the skin was not only not crispy it seemed like I had developed a whole new class of man- made rubber. There was a small amount of tasty meat but most of it was just too tough to be enjoyable. Very frustrating for the time and the cost - wish I knew where this one went south.

I left the skin on the orange for boiling the sauce and really noticed the bitterness in the final reduction. I think I'll peel the orange and maybe zest in some peel next time.

I'm giving this three stars because the family loved it, but I thought it was just okay. To me, the gravy was too sweet, and I think corn starch is a difficult thickener to work with. The flavor of the oranges didn't really infuse the meat the way that I was hoping. That said, the shallots are absolutely incredible. They are easy, compliment the meat beautifully, and would be delicious with other types of roasted meat as well.

Made this for Christmas dinner. I cooked two geese for 10 people and had very little leftover (two extra legs).The sauce was incredible and ciykd be made the day ahead. I didn't make the shallots but did use the goose fat for potatoes roasted in goose fat (recipe elsewhere on this site). Also excellent. This recipe was a lot of work because I followed Julia Child's recipe for preparing the goose by removing the wishbone, etc. before scalding the birds. I had 2 ten pounders and they were done a bit sooner than the time allotted here. I probably won't do this again soon (The geese were over $100.) but the results were excellent.

This was my first Goose and it was Fabulous! I didn't have Maderia so I used Ruby Port. Then my wife brought home some Maderia an I made the sauce again. The Maderia sauce was good, but, the Ruby Port was soooo good that if certain religious factions ever learned about it there would be a commandment against it. I'm talking 5 star restraunt good!

I plan on using this for Christmas this year if my hunt goes well this week. Can I use a Canada Goose or, if not, what type of goose is recommended?

This is a wonderful recipe for both the everyday cook or the advanced chef. I have changed the recipe up a bit but followed the 'general idea' and it ALWAYS turns out spectacular. I have a hard time getting Madeira in my small town, I use a red Cabernet $2.99 tRADER jOES. I don't do the extra 'For the Shallots' section -- the orange-wine sauce/garvy you make with the goose is incredible and I serve it with the goose. It is incredible! I have been making it for 10 years!

I've been making Goose for Thanksgiving for 25 years and this recipe the best approach by far. Don't skip the drying! I suggest taking the Goose out when the thermometer reaches 160 as the Goose continues to cook.

This was much easier than I expected, and ... oh, the flavors! The gravy (sauce) was EX-ceptional, and the shallots delectable. Did everything according to the recipe, and it came out perfectly. I did have to cook the goose a bit longer, as ours was closer to 14-15 lbs. though. We're thinking of making this a Christmas tradition. It really is yummy--I'd suggest some rice or potatoes as a side to soak up the extra, delicious gravy though.

Fantastic...I followed the recipe to a t and it was a HUGE hit. The sauce was divine. The glazed shallots had even the pickiest eaters gobbling them up. Worth peeling all of 'em. This was my first goose, and I would definitely recommend this recipe.

While I didn't care for this recipe, my hunter husband and sons thought it was great!Maybe it's just the tough goose meat that I didn't care for.I think the way the recipe is formatted is not user friendly.They list the same ingredients repeatedly on the list, so when you see 4 small oranges on the first part, you think you simmer ALL those with the neck for broth. But you only use 1 orange for that part. My broth ended up SOOO bitter from too many oranges.So I tossed the sauce, and started over using chicken base.The sauce turned out very good, and the carmelized shallots were great with it. But this whole recipe took forever to make. I started on it the night before, and spent a couple hours making the glazed shallots and orange sauce.Then the next day spent a few more hours cooking the goose.I think it's not worth it.

Honestly, I changed so many things in this recipe it probably isn't fair to even comment. I was afraid it would be too sweet so I added some savory aspects to contrast. First, we used salt, pepper, and herbs de Provence on the bird for flavor - then we slow roasted at around 200-215 for 4 hours, breast side down. Only turning up the heat and turning the bird over towards the end. This yielded an unbelievably moist goose - still characteristically "chewy" but tender and moist. Also, the carcass was stuffed with orange, onion, and garlic. For the sauce aspect I added garlic and a dash of savory, and used port instead of Madeira. When it came to reducing/cornstarch later I forgot the honey altogether and felt no loss - it was unbelievably sweet as it. For the shallots we ran out of port (no Madeira on hand) so I used half dry white wine and half sherry. Added 3 cloves garlic. Sweet, again. In the end we mixed the sauce and shallots - spread over the bottom of the serving dish and placed the goose, sliced, on top. Overall good, not a 10. I wouldn't necessarily write home about it, and I would make sure accompaniments were subtle and complimentary - perhaps simple green beans and roasted fingerlings. The focus will need to be on the goose as the centerpiece of this decadent, sweet meal. Worth making if only to observe some techniques for future recipes if you are new to cooking, unfamiliar with sauces, or like to dabble in (slightly) French methods.

The result was fantastic. I used it with young geese (8/9 lbs ea. I actually skipped the last corn starch "sauce" and it was great and rich anyway. I am yes an experienced cook, but i had never cooked goose, and it came out just perfect by mostly following the recipe. We made kaboocha squasch and other greans, rather than what recommanded. We pourede Medoc and did the pear tart (great :-)

I have not made goose before. I made this for a neighborhood dinner party. It was awesome. Made the sauces ahead and reheated. The aroma from sauces was wonderful.

I tried this at Christmas. It was utterly fantastic. The goose itself was surprisingly tender and incredibly flavorful, the skin crispy and delicious. My one question: I kept inserting a meat thermometer and it never reached the suggested temperture, but stalled at 175. I cooked it for 45 minutes more than expected, then gave up and took it out. It was perfect, but I'm wondering why it never hit the suggested temperature.

This was our first goose - everyone loved it, especially the gravy. There was one complaint about the "tough" goose - I prefer to agree with the previous reviewer's "chewy". Will definitely make this again.

glazed shallots exquisite, goose sauce worth the hassle, sauce such that even children used as gravy on their potatoes, just lovely, meat moist, skin crispy, I'll use this every time I do goose.

to answer the question is goose tough yes- but goose lovers prefer the term chewy. this recipe is different from the one i use but i will try this one soon.

This was delicious. Our first time making goose, but definitely not the last! We made a 15lb goose and it fed 7 adults with almost no leftovers, but we had lots of other dishes on hand and are not such big eaters. The meat was deliciously juicy, if a bit tough (but maybe goose is on the tougher side, any ideas?) The sauce is amazing, I will try it on duck, or even pork. Did not make the shallots. A tip for the reviewer who could not defrost or keep such a large bird: we keep ours in a cooler with some ice packs all around it and that works fine.

Good lord. Who's got a refrigerator big enough to defrost or keep a 13 lb. goose? This knocked me out. Go with duck instead. And the recipe was too sweet, too.

I made this for an early Christmas dinner and it was a hit! The sauce is incredible! I made it two days in advance and it was easy to rewarm and continue on the day of. The goose was a little tough, however, but I used a defrosted frozen goose and convention oven. So, I'm not sure if those factors or the quality of the goose was the issue. The cooking process of the goose was very easy. Yes, I would definitely make it again.

Made this for dinner on Christmas Eve. Got raves from all, even my mother and grandmother who are very picky and don't like goose. Best part -- for once we made it through a meal where my mother-in-law didn't tell me how my sisters-in-law do it better! Hooray for Epicurious!!!

Made for a great Christmas dinner. The sides are wonderful, and blanching the goose ahead of time did leave us with a wonderfully crispy skin.

This dish was excellent. We made it with a 12lb goose that fed two adults and two kids with very little left over. The shallot dish was really wonderful and is worth having with other game dishes (I would rate this 4 forks!). With this recipe the goose was not fatty in the least although it did provide ample goose fat that we used in other dishes.

I brought this to a Thanksgiving family dinner, where it was served along with Turkey and Ham. Bad idea on my part. None of the young adults would try it. Other folks, including me, enjoyed it. When blanching I let the water return to boil, which took about 10-15 mins. Don't know whether that was correct. I paid $4/lb. for a 12 lb goose. About half the meat as a 12 lb turkey. For me, too much money and time to serve to people who won't try something different; otherwise, the shallots/sauce make it great. Cooked faster than expected.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was superb! I'd invited 4 French friends and even they, some with the 'Christmas goose tradition,' asked for the recipe. I added thinly sliced oranges to the onions mixture and cooked for about 15 minutes to blend the flavors -- a great addition.

This recipe definitely made it the "A" list. I cooked this goose for our Christmas extended family get-together, and it was exceptional. Everyone loved it, and every bit was eaten. There were several requests for the recipe. Substituted port for Madeira and served a citrus rice/current/pine nut/shallot/celery dressing. Also served (believe it or not) Brussels sprouts with a butter-lemon sauce with a splash of fresh orange juice instead of the usual green beans. (Also, I remembered to defrost, but forgot about the 48-hour thing. I was worried, but then I remembered about Chinese duck, where sometimes a fan is blown on it for a long time. So, around 12 hours before dinner (early AM), I boiled the goose, then I situated with a fan blowing on it and wiped periodically with paper towels. I was worried, but the skin was crispy and tasted great. No one even knew I messed up.

Yum...I do have to say that the sauce and glazed shallots made this dish. I served this with a potato and wild mushroom galette and green beans and it made for a delicious Holiday meal.

Very good and very easy recipe for goose. My only reservation is the cooking time. I found my goose to be over-cooked after the suggested amount of time. I would recommend testing with a meat thermometer after 2 hours, and every 10 minutes afterwards until done. Don't forget, the temperature will rise 10* while the bird sits before carving. As to carving, be sure to slice the meat relative thinly, as it is quite rich, and very dense. I served with braised red cabbage and creamed turnips for a wonderful Christmas dinner.

I have never cooked a goose before, and this recipe brought rave reviews from everyone. I skipped the two days ahead prep, since I bought a domestic goose. Also cooked to 175, and seemed done perfectly. A wonderful dish for Christmas Dinner!

I had never even tasted goose before, but made this for Xmas dinner. It was a huge success as everyone loved it especially the sauce. They even went into the kitchen and picked the carcass clean. Would certainly make this again.

We really enjoyed all the parts of this meal. However, I still have a couple of questions regarding the cooking times: 1)Does boiling the goose for 1 minute mean to put the goose in boiling water and wait until it comes to a full boil (bubbles everwhere) and then time it for 1 minute? and 2)We never seem to get the right spot for the thermometer and although the goose seemed cooked, which at 180, it should, does cooked goose fall apart like dark meat on a turkey or chicken? I'd love a response - everyone else seems to really know what they're doing cooking goose.

Never even considered cooking goose before, but was talked into it -- everybody loved it, even my seven year old! I had no chicken stock (can you imagine that?) but, being so close to thanksgiving, I used turkey stock throughout. Used a meat thermometer, cooking the bird to 175 instead of 180 -- the meat was absolutely perfect.

I followed the directions except for the 2-days ahead prep. All my guests raved about the goose and the sauce, gravy and glazed shallots. After I removed the goose and drained the pan, I roasted Yukon potatoes in the remaining goose fat. I also served wild rice with currents, pinenuts and diced onions. It, too, was delicious. The only drawback was there was not much meat to eat on the goose. However, the goose did produce lots of fat, which will enhance future dishes.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner instead of the traditional turkey. It was terrific. Not at all greasy, although I had a problem finding a pan big enough to boil the goose in. The Shallots were a hit and I will make them with many other dishes. Served this with Baked Mashed potatos and Yams, and Wheat Berry Stuffing with pearl onions. Both recipies are available on this site.

Outstanding! Only caveat is use your own judgment as to cooking time for the goose--I found the time in the recipe was too long. The shallots in particular are delicious; I've made them on their own to serve with other meats (try them atop a pan-broiled filet mignon...yum). I cannot disagree more with Montreal, who suggests dried shallots--you must use fresh ones!!

I have been wanting to do a Christmas Goose for years. My wife thought I was crazy but with the support of my two daughters,it was a go and it was great.Will definitely do it again.I have used the shallot sauce for other poultry dishes. I also saved the goose grease and have used it to make fried potatoes in a 12 inch cast iron skillet on my grill. I use only about one tablespoon of grease and it makes for the greatest potatoes,very crispy and not greasy.

This is a wonderful recipe. I was anxious about making goose for the first time - for Christmas dinner no less - but this was not difficult and it was delicious. Rave reviews from my whole family all of whom are gourmands. The goose was not dry and not greasy. The shallots were delicious, and the sauce was incredible. It really helped me to be ably to make the sauce and shallots the day before so I could concentrate on the other parts of the meal I served a wild and long grain rice dish and green beans and red peppers with marjoram and almonds with it (another epicurious.com recipe). I will do it all again next Christmas!

I made this receipe for our cristmass eve dinner. has I was preparing it I realized that shallots should have read dry shallots, it is the inly way this receipe make sense. Lucky enought I had dry shallots. Everything turn out well, except the sauce is to sweet. I may do it again, but this time without the honey.

Excellent, crispy and not at all greasy. I was concerned about the method, so similar to Peking Duck, but it was terrific. It was served with a tart salad of citrus, baby greens, jicama, avocado, and red onion and accompanied by red cabbage, sugar pod peas, and potato kugel, and topped off with lemon chiffon pie. Super dinner.
