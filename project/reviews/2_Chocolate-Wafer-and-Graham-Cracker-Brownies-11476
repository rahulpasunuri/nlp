Funny, I didn't like them eitherbut my young guests, all teenagers, thought they were the best brownies they'd ever had. I'll certainly make them again. Nice to have a brownie recipe everybody else loves that I'm not tempted by!

I was curious after finding this unusual brownie recipe. It was so bad that I think Gourmet should refund the money I spent on ingredients. It was a hideous combination of dry, spongy, soggy bottom, and inedible.
