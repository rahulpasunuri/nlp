This was a disappointment. Actually, I followed the advice of several other reviewers and added some orange juice (fresh squeezed) to the marinade, about 1 1/2 Tbs. worth, and grated the garlic for more garlic-power. The result: yuck. It was overwhelmingly orange. The rosemary, and sadly the garlic too, were completely lost/gone. And I kicked myself for chosing this recipe over a nice jerk. What a waste of my beautiful tuna steak. We had to douse it with soy just to temper the blasted orange. Hmph.

I marinated tuna steaks and then cook them on the grill whole. Served with an orzo pilaf and a chopped romaine salad with red onion, orange sections and sliced almonds dressed in a light vinaigrette. Delish!

I disagree with the chef from NYC, I think the orange was almost overpowering (I'll use less next time) and the tuna was perfect, although my fishmonger cut it a little big. But this dish was a huge hit!

This is so easy, with a wonderful summery taste. I have nade this a number of times and always receive nice comments. I usually substitute pineapple for the tomato and use tomato in a side dish (tomato & feta or mozarella). This way, the grilled fruit amounts to a second side dish.

Was difficult, expensive and simply not that good. The orange flavor didn't come through and tuna makes a bad kebob option.

A wonderful balance of flavors! We added 1/2 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup dry white wine to the ingredients to make a marinade, and marinated the tuna for about 2 hours. Grilled it "medium" and added red onion to the skewers. Served with potato salad and spring peas sauteed with fennel. A delicious summer dinner! We used metal skewers.

Too expensive and did not taste good.

It's a nice marinade that doesn't overwhelm the fish. Also, not soy based, it's a bit different. My wife loved it.

Very simple and delicious, added fresh squeezed orange juice to marinade, use sushi-grade tuna, have made this for company and got great reviews.

I soaked tuna steaks in the sauce whichI also added the of juice from one orange and then grilled them. This twist worked just fine and all of the flavors melded wonderfully. As with any grilled fish, make sure not to over cook. I will use this recipe again.

The only change that I made is to buy the brochettes already made. Very expensive meal but it worth to do it.

Our dinner club enjoyed this recipe very much, adjusted in the following ways: 1) added orange juice to the marinade; 2) marinated tuna for approx. 2 hours; 3) composed skewers of oranges, tuna and pineapple, alternating between fruit and fish (we were serving tomatoes and onions in a side dish). The grilled pineapple turned out to be a great touch--delicious.

Served this to family. It was a smash hit. The marinade was delicious. Very important to get fresh tuna though - we bought some practically sushi quality tuna and really just seared it. Top notch dish especially for those that are health conscious...

Bland! To enhance it we smothered it with Paul Newman's Ceasar Salad dressing, and added some fresh homemade hummus with each bite. Then it was quite good. I wouldn't make it again, but I am particulary averse to bland food.

Really good. Added extra tomatoes/oranges. Also tried wrapping a bit of everything in foil instead of skewering, this was juicier. Plus adding a couple sprigs of rosemary to the fire gave it all a nice "smoky" touch.

Great summer dish. I made it as is (with some extra oranges ) and it was a hit.

Very good. I used albacore tuna, but think that any fish would be great. I will definitely make this again. Next time I plan to use halibut and also think that salmon would be excellent.

Wonderful! I substituted new potatoes for the cherry tomatoes, and doubled both those and the orange wedges. The fragrance alone is worth making this one again!

Had this last night, though I replaced the oil with white wine and the rosemary with herbs of Provence. I served it over rice and it was fantastic! I particularly liked the grilled orange pieces!

Excellent!!! I made this with Bulgur salad w/ cucumbers and tomatoes. If doing these two dishes together add more orange slices. The sour from the tomatoes and cucumbers in these dishes really need the sweetness of the oranges to counterbalance it.

This dish has a very unique flavor. The orange peel in the marinade gives off a lot of flavor and makes a great summertime dinner.
