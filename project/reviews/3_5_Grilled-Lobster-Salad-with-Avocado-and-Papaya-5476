The dressing was bitter. I used shrimp, so I didn't spend a fortune, but the dressing just didn't do it and nobody really liked this.

I doubled the recipe and served it for a lunch for 10 people. Everyone raved! I used Florida lobster tails and boiled them, I also added a little bit of honey to the citrus dressing. Next time I would probably use mango instead of papaya.

To heck with the lobster which is expensive and hard to get in Texas...I used grilled mahi-mahi and mango as subsitutions and the result was excellent. Worth a try even without the meat/fish.

One word: Delicious!!!!!!! Make sure you grill the lobster, it makes all the difference.

Previous rater was exactly right: let your grocery store steam cook the lobsters because it's a lot of work to grill your own AND make this delicious avocado-tomato-papaya salsa. I would divide this recipe into two: 1) bring home cooked lobster from the grocery and proceed with the recipe. Use cherry tomatoes because they're sweeter and easier to handle. 2) Save this grilled mesquite lobster recipe for another meal; the boiling/grilling recipe works PERFECTLY and results in a terrific summer dinner with a little drawn butter, but it's a lot to do for this salad which really doesn't need the mesquite taste to be successful.

When I first made this, I did not have the exact ingredients so substituted - I used mango instead of papaya. I also cheated and bought my lobster. It was such a hit,I have made it the same way since on several occasions. The citrus dressing is such a lovely flavour with lobster, and added to mango and avocado - it's quite scrumptious!
