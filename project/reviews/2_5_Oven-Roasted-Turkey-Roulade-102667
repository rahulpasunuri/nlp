Never again. There was way too much roasted garlic (which I like) for Turkey and the olives were too much. I am sure there are better stuffings for a roulade.

This recipe was a diappointment. Way too much lemon flavoring for my family's taste and the meat was on the dry side. To each their own I guess.

I was looking forward to trying this recipe because of all the good reviews but we were sadly disappointed in the result. The flavors did not seems to meld and we decided that the stuffing is more appropriate for fish rather than turkey. Each taste was good on its own but together...strange result. I may make the stuffing again with red snapper but will not make this recipe as written.

This dish was quite fast and easy and turned out very moist. I altered the stuffing greatly based upon what I had handy in the kitchen at the time. I was short on the garlic so I roated 5 cloves and 2 whole shallots. I substitued black olive tapenade for the olives, and red pepper for the celery. I also added capers to the mix. Delicious and impressive without too much work involved. Will make again sometime.

The mingled scent of lemon and garlic wowed my family before this dish even hit the table! And it tasted great too! All the perils of skinless white meat turkey were overcome: blandness, dryness, boring look. I was able to stuff the rolled turkey back into the netting it came home from the butcher in and also skipped the cheesecloth and basted more often, which made shopping for this recipe a lot easier.
