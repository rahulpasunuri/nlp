Really Yummy. I used this on top of the Vermont Maple cheesecake. I think it would be really nicely pared with a pumkin cheesecake. I will do that for Thanksgiving.

This topping was soooo tasty! I'm not a huge ice cream fan, so that is the reason for only a three fork rating. I would highly recommend Haagen Dazs vanilla as an accompaniment. Yummy!

Excellent. I served it on the side of a fruit crumble for those who wanted more sweetness- everyone did once the first person raved.

Want to die and go to heaven? Substitute maple sugar for the regular sugar and omit the fake extract. There is no such thing as real maple extract. It's all imitation flavoring. YUCK! I found a great source for grade B maple syrup. Just go to www.saintpierrefarms.com

A great topping to make for ice cream when you don't have time to make desert. I had it with butter pecan ice cream-- you can't go wrong!!!

This recipe is very good. I would defintely make it again. It is absolutely divine over vanilla ice cream.
