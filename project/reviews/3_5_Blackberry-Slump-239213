The amount of topping and cake wss WAY too much for the amount of fruit. It tasted OK, but I like a lot more moist fruit than this provided. Might make it again and adjust the proportions.

This got rave reviews from my family. It's not fancy, but it's super delicious. We ate it with ice cream.

We live on Bainbrdige and ate dinner a couple of nights ago at the Four Swallows: We ended our delicious meal with Blackberry Slump. Today I made this recipe for a dinner party -- the only change I made was to add lemon zest to the cake instead of vanilla. This gave a a nice sharp tang to the desert and really helped complement the sweetness of the blackberries. It was a huge success served with creme fraiche.
