I made these to serve alongside Indian chicken curry, paired with raita. I had never made flatbread before, and was surprised at how easy it was! It was a bit of a stretch to make 8 servings out of the recipe, so I whipped up another batch after my guests arrived and they were done in no time flat! I was glad I did, as I had many compliments and no leftovers. Do serve these with raita, however -- the coriander/cilantro mix is strong, and I was very glad to have the cucumber raita to balance and cool the flavor.

These take a bit of time when you've got three or four other curry dishes on the go - but they are worth it - better to make with the left over curries the next day when there's more counter space to roll them out - great flavour, easy enough to make. I've made them 3 or 4 times now, will continue to do so!

Tasty last minute addition to our Indian meal! The texture would be better if it were yeasted, but I didn't have time. We're a dairy-free house, so I subbed 1/2c. soymilk and an egg for the yogurt. Also, fried the spices in about 2T. olive oil before adding to the flour. Spices taste much better fried.

Fantastic! I make these when I don't have much time, and everyone likes them. They're simple and easy to prepare. I actually added a little cumin to them, which just makes the flavour even bolder. Also, I find that Fage greek yoghurt works better than any other brand I've tried, although Chobani is almost as good. I first made these as an experiment into Indian cuisine with rava masala dosas. Now I make them with almost anything!

These were fun to make, easy, tasty and also a fun addition to an Indian meal. Will definitely make again.

This was a very simple and quick recipe. I was nervous about making my own bread, but they turned out beautifully (golden, crispy yet soft) and were a big hit. We paired these with Dal and a cucumber riata. I kept them on a plate in a 200 degree oven until dinner was ready and it was just perfect.

Was bored with the usual so thought I would adventure into a bit of Indian: made these along with the Traditional Raita and Chicken Vindaloo all from BA. Quite successful combination. The flatbreads in particular were outstanding. Would strongly recommend rolling them out thin as they fried up better compared to thicker ones. I used Greek whole milk yogurt since that is what my grocery service stocks. Will make this again.

I've made this several times already. It's a really good fit for a Chicken Tikka Masala recipe I'm hooked on. I leave out the fresh cilantro so my kids will eat them. I found the whole milk yogurt in the health food section at the grocery store and it makes really good raita too. Incredibly fast and easy way to get fresh flatbread.

Made these for a Sunday afternoon barbecue. Due to a wheat allergy, I used spelt and brown rice flour. They came out really well, and even my husband who is not a fan of cilantro really enjoyed them. Will definitely make these again. We made the cucumber raita to go with it (the may 2008 recipe).

Did I do something wrong? I made the recipe exactly as written. I cooked the flatbreads on a well-seasoned griddle over a gas stove. It tasted like burned flour. I didn't get any of the coriander or cilantro flavors. I really wanted to like it -- I wanted it to be like the bread you get at Quiznos on their sammy sandwiches. This recipe had the right consistency and thickness and chewiness, but not the right flavor. Floury. The dough was VERRRY sticky. Maybe I overcompensated with too much flour to make it manageable.

to andy_andersen from Guelph, ON, Cilantro is the fresh leaf, and coriander is the seed.

Incredibly easy and really delicious - soft on the outside and crisp on the inside. we served these with muhummara.

I thought coriander and cilantro were the same thing. Do they mean ground coriander seeds and chopped coriander leaves?

Wow. These are super easy and phenomenal. I don't understand how something with so few ingredients tastes so darn good. I made the raita dip to go with it. Love this! You won't be disappointed.

These turned out great! Really easy and forgiving...I had to add a little extra yogurt at first, then a little extra flour, but they turned out just fine. I also made some using fresh parsley and dried dill, and those were really nice; I think you could substitute a lot of different herbs and spices in this recipe.

Really tender insides with crisp outsides...and the freshly ground coriander seeds have a lemony undertone that works super well!!

Where is the recipe for the cucumber riata?

These were very tasty. Not as pretty as the picture either, but when they are that good who cares! Very good with the cucumber riata.

These were light and tasty and easy to make. My kids loved them. They didn't look as nice as the picture's but the taste was good. I had to use about 1 1/4 C of yogurt to make a soft enough dough.
