I have not made this yet, but am planning to for Easter dinner this weekend, along with a ham, grilled boneless leg of lamb, and of course, roasted asparagus. Thanks to everyone for all of the tips in advance. I intend to use mushrooms instead of ham. I am quite sure the dish will be delicious. Also, good old Pyrex makes some nice, larger shallow baking dishes that would be perfect for this recipe - not the plain glass, but the French White.

Fantastic recipe! There is a lot of room for adaptation based on what you have at hand. I used a mix of ham and hot italian sausage; swiss, provolone, and pepper jack; and a mix of milk, cream, and chicken broth. Came out delicious. As others, I used sourdough, and mixed everything in a bowl instead of overlaping. It made a lot. Highly recommend.

I used sourdough and as others recommended, sauteed the spinach a little and squeezed the water out before adding it to the bread pudding. I also used a mix of gouda and gruyere since I didn't have fontina. The pudding came out pretty perfectly, crusty on top, semi creamy in the middle (but not soupy).

Agree with others that cubing the bread makes it easier. The fresh spinach throws off alot of water, which made the base of the casserole soupy. Next time I will either lightly saute the fresh spinach and squeeze the water out, or use thawed frozen and also squeeze it dry before adding.

This is a delicious recipe! I used our leftover Christmas ham and it turned out great. My husband and two little boys loved it, too. I cut the baguette into cubes instead of slices and mixed all the ingredients together instead of what the directions said to make it a little easier. I also used a little extra cheese to sprinkle on top. The only problem was is took about one and a half hours to cook instead one. This is definitely worth making again and again.

Great use of leftover ham. I've made this dish several times for guests and it's always a big hit. Like several of the other reviewers, I don't do the tucking and there doesn't seem to be a difference in the outcome. Lastly, instead of a baguette, I've used 6 slices of toasted sourdough bread from Trader Joe's with good results.

THIS IS SO GOOD! First I tried it for myself using turkey sausage instead of ham, then I took it to church for "coffee hour" where we usually have too much sweets, and it was a big hit. I would like to vary it even more by using whatever I have handy. Will let you know what is successful.

Ready-made Stratas are perfect for brunch while entertaining several guests and this one stands up nicely to the classic savory ingredients expected at brunch: ham, eggs and cheese. I've made several times with little variation. A mixture of gruyere and fontina might be nice..

We loved this recipe as did my husband's co-workers, who all wanted the recipe. Finally, a use for leftover ham! I would say this recipe makes closer to 8 servings, maybe even 10. Modifications, some of which came from the helpful folks here: I used leftover italian bread I had in the freezer. After thawing, cut it into chunks, tossed with melted butter and broiled. Added a touch of sugar to the onions while caramelizing. Used smoked gouda - amazing. I saved some for the top and it did not melt well, but still looked and tasted great. I used baby spinach and did not chop. Next time, I will allow onions and ham to cool a bit, then add spinach to melt it somewhat. I had enough egg that "layering" would not have worked, so I see what the recipe meant by "tucking". Next time, after the onion mixture cools, I will put it in a bowl and toss with the bread and egg, then pour that into the baking dish. I had forgotten to grease the dish, but as i had tossed the bread with butter in that same dish, we didn't have an issue with sticking. Enjoy!

This was a huge hit with my family and a great way to use up holiday ham. I made a few changes, using leftover bread and a mixture of soy milk and cream to fully clean out the fridge. The pudding did not set in the suggested cooking time. Next time I will add one more egg, cook for a longer time, and mix the ingredients before pouring it all into the pan.

I made this for New Years Day two years ago and this year 2007 I will make it for Christmas brunch. It is simply a wonderful dish. Follow it as written and if you have time please caramelize the onions. I served 25 people who ALL loved it - no joke! and this year it will be for four. It's so YUMMY!!!!! A real must have and easy ;)

This was great for my leftover party honey- baked ham! It's even good as leftovers. Used sourdough baguette--yum! Hit with all houseguests! A keeper.

This one was a hit with my family. I used Easter ham, stale baguette, with swiss cheese and smoked gouda. I approximated the ingredients based on what I had and the size of the casserole dish. The ham was spiral sliced, so I didn't get very large chunks of meat and next time I will put in more spinach, but the smokey taste of the gouda added a nice touch.

There is nothing disappointing about this dish. A great use of leftover ham from a previous dinner added with some great cheese and fresh bread. How can you go wrong? A definite keeper!

I'd be looking for recipes to make use of my leftover ham from Easter and this fit the bill perfectly. I followed other reviewers suggestions (cut bread into smaller pieces, etc.) and found that this worked out well. A great brunch dish.

I was pretty disappointed with this dish. The pudding took a long time to set in the middle. Even when it did set, it wasn't all that impressive. It seemed like just a big pile of food. I won't make again.

Pretty, nice texture and (thanks for the suggestion) beautiful in the 3 qt LeCreuset casserole. It could use a little zip, tho, so a little dijon mustard on some bread slices would help.

I made this for Christmas breakfast. My kids wanted a quiche, but I insisted on something different. I was happy; they were not. It was easy to make. The onions were the key ingredient--they made the turkey ham we used taste wonderful. Our only comment would be that the bread slices were too big and we ended up with hunks of plain (no ham, cheese, spinach) bread every serving (making it unappealing to the kids). If I were to make it again, I would probably cut the bread up into crouton-sized pieces, allowing for a bit of ham and spinach in every bite.

I am a big fan of breakfast or brunch casseroles that can be popped in the fridge the night before and baked in the morning, and this is one of the best I have found on this site, at least among the savories. (Creme brulee French toast is the best of the sweet ones, I think.) Anyhow, I made this almost exactly as written, except for the silly "tucking" instruction, and I buttered the dish, like many other reviewers. I found the quantities of ingredients called for to work out perfectly. It was a bit time-consuming to prep, but a lot of that time involved buttering and toasting the bread, which I may skip next time to see if it makes any difference. I was tempted to cook the spinach with the onions and ham, but I didn't and it came out just fine. I made two layers of toast, ham-onion mix, spinach, egg-milk mix, and cheese, in that order. My family just devoured it. Note to the cook from New York- Le Creuset makes a great shallow 3 quart casserole that is perfect for this recipe and a lot of others that are too big to fit in those boring 9x13 pyrex jobs.

Needed more liquid. Perhaps I used a very large baguette.

My family loves this dish and we eat it often as a mid-week meal, and it's the first thing we think of when we have stale bread. I've substituted other breads, and I never toast it. Occassionally I'll split the recipe into two baking dishes. Makes great leftover for lunch.

Absolutely wonderful. Made it as written, except halved all ingredients. I did butter the dish.

I saw Sara Moulton make this one morning and I tell you she saved me a lot of work during this holiday season. I served it on three separate occasions, and each time everyone wanted seconds and the recipe.I was able to fix it the night before, which allows the egg mixture to soak completely through the French Bread, and the flavors seemed to be infused another notch. I didn't add too many frills, maybe more cheese and I did cook my fresh baby spinach before adding it, I could add more and also squeeze the moisture out. Make sure you allow the onions and smoked ham to get golden as it does add the extra depth you will love. I served it with a sliced fennel bulb and apple, minced shallots with celery and roasted walnut salad. Made a quick and simple light Dijon, EV Olive oil, fresh lemon juice and coarse grained mustard dressing. A big platter of roasted Winter vegetables. All done the evening before.So easy and so delcious !!!

My new brunch standby! I put in chorizo instead of ham - YUM! I've also done a vegertarian version with artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers. I followed the instructions (toasting the bread, tucking, etc.) but will try it without next time.

Maybe I'm slow, or maybe it was constant interruption from 3 kids, but prep for me took 1 & 1/2 hours. After that build-up, the dish was anticlimactic. I would make it again for the right occasion, but ditto to the many who suggest foregoing the tucking and soaking. I found it much tastier the second day, and not so soggy. My ham was salty enough that I shouldn't have added more.

I do not toast and butter bread but just cut it up and leave it out to dry overnight. Nor do I arrange. I just mix everything up and pour into buttered casserole dish. This serves many more than 6!

Was worried about the fat content so made it with reduced fat milk and left out the melted butter on the bread and it was still delicious.

Quite tasty, easy to put together while cleaning or doing something else. I added sauteed mushrooms which really sparked it. This does need a shallow dish to cook in, I put it in a casserole that was too deep, so it had trouble cooking the custard all the way through.

Boy, was this good! I made sure that the bread was really nicely toasted on both sides, used leftover spiral ham and caramelized the onions. Served with a simple green salad with a good vinaigrette and it's a lunch/brunch dish that's hard to beat!

I've made this recipe twice and it was a real winner both times. I found that prep time was closer to two hours; maybe it would be closer to the 30 minutes noted if more than one cook was helping with the prep work. The second time, I chilled the recipe and made it the next day, and it was just as good as if I had made it right away.

excellent, I make it with sharp cheddar cheese instead. My children love it.

this was a great recipe I used a rosemary baguette, and I also buttered the baking dish as suggested. I also found that layering the bread made assembly much easier. I however did soak the baguette slices. It worked out well Thank you.

I agree with many of the other comments I read. I have made this dish several times, and yes the pan needs to be buttered. I find layering easier than "tucking". I have also made vegetarian versions, most recently with spinach, broccolirabi, sauteed mushrooms and onions (with a bit of sugar before they were done). Then, before serving, a light smearing of a "Mango, Ginger Conserve" to offset the somewhat bitter greens.

VERY tasty, and a real crowd pleaser! I agree about the layering of the ingredients with the earlier reviewer -- it's virtually impossible to assemble the way the recipe describes. But worth it!

I agree with the other cook that the dish should be buttered before placing the ingredients in. I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it!

Although very tasty this advid cook found the recipie flawed. I used a large All-Clad brasier to bake the dish and thought that it should have been buttered before baking. (Lord knows where anyone but a food stylist would find a 3 quart casserole that was as shallow as the one featured.) Also the assembly process should be adjusted... place the spinach, etc. between the bread then pour the egg mixture over all. Otherwise you are working with bread that is too soggy.

This recipe was easy and the result enjoyable and interesting. We made a few substitutions - instead of ham, used tuna (canned) and used buttermilk and soy milk instead of full cream milk. Served it with caramelised onions, which gave it a real lift. There are endless variations that could be made on this basic recipe - I'll definitely be trying some more.

Excellent blend of flavors!! I used Virginia ham so it turned out a little on the salty side, I'll back off on the salt next time. This dish reminded me more of a strata, but bread pudding seems like a more intriguing name.
