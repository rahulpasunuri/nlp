This sauce was yummy! I did eliminate half the olive oil and it was very runny but it was very tasteful. However, it may have been after I subbed 1/4 of the needed lime juice for yuzu sauce to give it more of a citrusy kick which is not authentic but ended up being delicious for my pescado tacos. It was runny so next time I may blend in some avocado to make it thicker. I definitely would blend rather than whisk that way everything is in a nice sauce consistency when eating.

Thank you Karmicflower from Miami!I followed her recipe, just altering by adding a little oregano. Marinade country pork ribs overnight, cooked 400 for 1 1/2 hours. Delicious! Served with rice, black Cuban beans, and mango salsa. Gracias!

Most of the basics of this recipe are sound, but the proportions are wrong, and some of the ingredients are completely wrong. Being Cuban, and learning to make mojo with my grandmother I know good mojo. Cilantro and orange peel simply don't belong. The other ingredients are part of the traditional recipe, but are not in correct proportions. Plus mojo, at least in my family was not used directly on food as a sauce. Rather it is used as a marinade and the drippings from the meat, that was the sauce, or Cuban gravy. Here is my recipe: mix together 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt, and 5-8 tsp of minced garlic together to form a paste. Heat 1/2 cup of olive oil, till its very hot and pour over paste mix. Stir and let cool. Meanwhile you can either use sour oranges (traditional) or a mixture of lime and orange juice... so 6 Tbsp sour orange, or 3 Tbsp lime juice & 3 Tbsp orange juice. Add that to the oil, paste mixture and use as a marinade. I like to take a whole chicken, place it in a large ziploc bag, pour the mojo sauce over it and let it marinade overnight. Then you place it in the oven for 1 hr at 375. The dripping are you mojo sauce, that you can spoon over the chicken, rice, etc. You can even reserve it for later use in the fridge, just warm through before serving. You could also use it on pork, steaks, etc. Hope this helps.

I loved this sauce! I made the pork from the Braised Pork with Mojo Sauce recipe as directed, and as it finished cooking added some of the mojo sauce to the juices. Mmmm! But I did eliminate at least half of the oil. the sauce doesn't really need it. Try this with jumbo shrimp and lots of garlic on a griddle. the sauce goes so many ways.

I was disappointed in the overall flavor of this sauce. I used it as a marinade for pork tenderloin and the only word I have to describe it is "blah". No single flavor stood out and it just didn't add much to the pork at all. Possibly reducing the sauce down to a think sauce and drizzling it over after grilling might be an option, but I have better options for pork so I most likely won't use this recipe again.

Clarification: This recipe is a version of the Mojo marinade, a common marinade used in Cuban cuisine. It is used in the preparation of lechon (roast pork), churrasco (strip steak), et al.

This recipe DOES make a lot of sauce, but I found that the proportions were good. It is the perfect accompaniment to the pork. In fact, I serve the pork along with a crisp green salad and drizzle the mojo on everything. It is that good.

I give this a "2" because it is presented as a sauce to accompany pork. This is no sauce, it's waaaay too runny to stick to a meat of any kind. I said I would make it again, however, because I used the remaining sauce to marinade some chicken breasts before grilling. Now THAT was yummy. This makes a wonderful marinade (but don't let it marinade too long with all of that lime - no more than an hour or two).
