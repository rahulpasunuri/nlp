Excellent, flavorful recipe. I like bold flavors, so disagree with the reviewer that thought there was too much lemongrass, chile, and turmeric. I made it with the minimal modifications suggested by other reviewers: fish sauce, slight reduction in the amt of turmeric (but 1 tsp would have been fine). Also used a whole onion rather than half, and Thai bssil because I couldn't find the pepper leaf. Used a mini food processor to pulverize the lemongrass. Will definitely make again.

I made this dish for my 7-year-old son who loves tofu. He was away on a class trip for three days and I wanted to make him a special dinner, so decided it was time to jump on the tofu making wagon. And let me tell you, what a hit!!! This was a phenomenal dish! I had to dumb it down a bit chili wise for his delicate palate, but other than that. I stuck to the recipe and served some spicy chili sauce on the side. I am officially a tofu liker! I highly recommend this dish for anyone trying to venture into the realm of tofu. It was great!

Quite tasty tofu! I use a microplane on frozen lemongrass- works like a charm. I substituted fish sauce for half the soy as others recommended. Served it with the snap peas + chile & mint recipe on this site.

Exceptionally easy to make and absolutely delicious. Required an hour of prep, but it was all easy. I thought the spice levels were just fine (contrary to other reviews). I just substituted 1 tbl of fish sauce for 1 tbl of soy sauce for flavor. But I am thrilled with the results.

Ist time "cooking" tofu. I cut the lemon grass into pieces and smashed to release flavor so as not to have to deal with the bits in the marinade and aside from only using 3/4 tsp. of tumeric followed the remainder of the recipe as written. Will definetly make again.

Most flavorful tofu recipe I have ever made. After reading the reviews, I reduced the turmeric to 1/2 tsp., I added 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and I used a serrano chili and cilantro instead of Thai basil, because that's what was in the house. I also pressed my tofu for 30 minutes before marinating it. We practically fought over the last few bites!

Definitely good, but I should have pressed my tofu -- it crumbled instead of staying in cubes. I also added some baby bok choy and thinly sliced carrots for a little veg in the mix.

I used less than 1 tsp of turmeric but still found it overpowering. The flavours were not nice together and it probably would have been better with no turmeric at all. This recipe was very disappointing considering the reviews.

This is now one of my favorite tofu recipes. A wonderful flavor combination that even tofu-skeptics will gobble up! I have made it many times staying true to the recipe. But I have also made it using fish sauce instead of soy, and throwing in chopped scallions instead of peanuts. It's good anyway you slice it.

I thought this was great - I had no problem with the turmeric or the lemongrass. It was so good I didn't even notice that I had forgotten to add the peanuts at the end!

This recipe was very disappointing. The amount of lemon grass required was too much and the suggestion of chopping it finely does not work. The required quantity of chilli is too much, for even an Asian palate. The quantity of turmeric used is also too much, as it makes the the recipe bitter. I made this recipe twice to see if it was me, or the recipe, and the recipe is simply one that does not work. I would certainly not recommend this recipe.

I really liked this and probably would give it 4 forks if i could figure out a way to make the lemongrass more tender. I peeled it down, but it was still tough. Perhaps I chopped it too small. It was super, next time I might just try lemon zest to avoid the hard chunks of lemongrass.

This is the best meatless recipe for tofu that I have ever eaten, much less cooked. The lemongrass puts it over the top, but I imagine it would be delicious without it, so don't wait to cook it until you can hunt some down. If you get addicted to this recipe, root some lemongrass in water in late winter and grow it in your garden all season.
