Excellent! A little bit of work, but really worth it!

Delish! Great to make a fine dining restaurant tasting salad at home. Our first time at poaching eggs -- don't know why we never tried it before. Quite easy. Makes for a wonderful twist on breakfast for dinner.

Because we were in the breakfast mood I actually wanted to make just the eggs benedict portion sans salad. I have never poached in water before and it was easy so was the hollandaise. And yes I would make it again!
