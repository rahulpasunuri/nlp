I used this general recipe, but added a few touches. Like other reviewers, I did a 50/50 split of Whole Milk and Half & Half. I also simmered the reserved orange juice to about half volume, and let it cool before adding it to the egg/dairy mixture. Finally, I added a small touch of vanilla extract and cointreau. The former to give it an orange-creamsicle flavor and the latter to give it more of an orangey oomph. All told, it came out well.

Am a devoted ice cream maker, but this went off the rails; the base turned into a foam under the mixer, and then the yolks cooked immediately upon being heated, so had a strainer full of orange zest-flecked scrambled eggs! Salvaged what I could, a very small amount, and added some vanilla and orange flower water. We shall see!

I just tried to make this and it went horribly wrong! I won't rate the recipe since it could well be my own fault. I suspect the problem is with the zest. I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting one cup of heavy cream and one cup lasctose-free 2% milk for the 2 cups whole milk the recipe called for. I did make a small mistake in that I added both tablespoons of zest to the milk ingredients at the beginning. The taste of this stuff is way too strong from the zest, to the point that I feel like I have a chemical burn and I only had a small taste. Also, it did not freeze properly in the machine. I just threw it out. I bought the nicest looking organic oranges I could find for this. I'm not sure I will ever want to try orange ice cream again.

Delicious and so creamy! I too made the same modifications of using 1/2 cream, 1/2 milk, added Cointreau, a little vanilla extract, and increasing recipe by 1/2. It worked out perfectly. I also reduced my fresh OJ down a bit to concentrate the flavor and not add so much liquid. Had problems with fresh strawberry ice cream turning to icy because of the liquid. This was awesome.

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used 1 cup of heavy cream and one cup of milk. I also added a teaspoon on Cointreau to the mixture. It was absolutely delicious - I served it with a chocolate and orange tart - and adding the alcohol meant that it was ready to scoop straight from the fridge.

This ice cream is incredible! I been making ice cream weekly for the past few years and this is one of my favorites. I took the advice listed in other reviews and did half cream half whole milk. I also added some extra OJ. I decided to do increase the recipe by 1/2 (didn't seem like enough!) and also let it sit over night to let the flavors intensify. Tastes like a creamcicle!

After reading the reviews I decided to substitute half the milk with heavy cream. I used blood oranges and it had a lovely pink shade to it. For the reviewer who didn't think it was "orange" enough: What kinds or oranges did you use? Were they fully ripe? Mine were almost overripe and the icecream was perfectly orangey and had a veyr creamy mouth feel. YUM!

Served with the "Rhubarb Lattice Pie w/ Cardamom and Orange," which was about the only redeemable aspect of the dessert. The ice cream was not very creamy, nor was its flavor as "orange" as I'd like it to be. If I were to make this again, I'd nearly double the orange zest and use a fair amount of heavy cream.

Because I like a denser, richer ice cream, I replaced one of the cups of milk with heavy cream. I also increased the OJ quotient by 1/8th cup and added chopped, sweetened cranberries to the end of my machine's cycle. The results were astounding! I should mention, however, that sitting one's ice cream maker atop the running dishwasher is NOT a good idea. Not even a little bit.

I made the recipe exactly as written- it was delicious! My husband says he won't eat store bought ice cream ever again!

This is a simple icecream recipe, flavored with orange zest and juice. I made it with blood oranges and it has a little twist of red in it. The color is great. I think this ice cream is also good to accompany a bittersweet chocolate tart.
