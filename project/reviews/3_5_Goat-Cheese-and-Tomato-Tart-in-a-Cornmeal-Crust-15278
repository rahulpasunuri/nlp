I choose this recipe for the crust and have to say it was a big let down. The cornmeal ratio was too high I thought, the crust was too gritty for my taste. I would reduce to 1/2 cup max.

Wow. Nothing in the reviews prepared me for the disaster that this tart has become. One: does 2- 1/4 sticks of butter seem excessive for a 10-inch tart? Not to mention that the shopping list, if you print it, suggests you purchase 12-1/4 sticks of butter. That typo might have tipped me off. The crust came together in the food processor well... crumbly before the ice water, enough gum after to shape into the tart tin. I put it in the freezer for 20 minutes and it was quite firm when I removed, added the foil, and some anasazi beans for weight, and cooked for the required 10 minutes. I pulled the tart out to remove the foil, and the entire shell was a mushy, greasy cornmeal mess. My bad: I mishandled the two-piece tart tin and it fell apart on the counter, I had to re-assemble and then cook for 10 more minutes, uncovered, to firm it up. The custard also came together easily and filled the now-pre-cooked crust perfectly. Added the tomatoes and set the timer for 25 minutes at 375. On finish, the custard "seemed" set and I let it sit for 15 minutes to cool before serving. When I came back, a finger test in the center proved the custard far from set. It has now been in the oven (returned to heat) for another 18-22 minutes! Not set after the initial, additional 11 minutes. We have a brand new, highly-rated Bertazzoni oven which is calibrated, and a thermometer inside which indicated the temp was correct. As our oven tends to run hot on the bottom, I put a sheet pan on the lower shelf, and cooked the tart on the upper shelf. Whatever the reason, the time seems way off for this dish, and the fat just too excessive (I love butter cream, and eggs, but seriously!). However, 30+ positive reviews can't be wrong, so I'll just chalk it up to experience and look for another way to use up the summer's last tomatoes!

I love this recipe. I originally made it as one large tart (per the recipe), but have since changed that... I now like to make mini tarts out of the cornmeal crust (using a mini-tart pan). I bake them and then fill each tart / crust with the custard mixture and put one halved cherry tomato (cut side up) in each tart before baking. They make nice little bite-sized appetizers. Everyone seems to love them!

Thoroughly enjoyed this as did the family. Great for left overs next day for a lovely lunch with a mesclen salad.

I made this for my cook-group, which has been cooking together for almost 30 years, and it was a big hit. I used a bit more basil than called for, and I substituted regular heirloom tomatoes, which I peeled and sliced. It looked as good as it tasted and disappeared quickly, everyone commenting on how wonderful it was. I'll keep making that one.

I have been making this tart for years -- it is the unanimous favorite among my friends. It's maybe a little rich for me -- one or two small squares of it is enough -- but no one has ever declined the chance to take leftovers home.

Here's an easy variation: I loved the crust - simple, held up well. I used it with the Onion, Tomato and Goat cheese tart recipe as filling because it was lighter and didn't have to be cooked a long time. Bake this crust a bit longer (maybe 15 mins covered and 7 uncovered); Then sautee two onions till carmelized. put onions in baked, cooled shell, cover with 1 1/2 cups crumbled goat cheese, slice tomatoes and lay on top in concentric circles; broil 3 minutes. Fab. (make sure to cover the edges of the crust while broiling. I didn't at first and, well, you know...)

Way too rich...not tomato-ey enough. We did chop up leftovers & mixed w/chicken for a chicken salad sandwich...that was better.

My local grocer didn't have fresh basil, so I subbed fresh parsley and added dried basil. I want to try it again w/ the basil b/c I think the substitution may have weakened the recipe. I made this as a tart for dinner and although I really liked it, my husband was less than thrilled. He thought the flavors were too strong; I thought the flavors were not strong enough (see my note about the basil). Like it, don't love it seems a good way to describe this one.

Way too rich and a bit bland. I'll make it again because it was so easy and looked pretty. Next time, I'll double the basil as others have suggested and use half regular goat cheese, half herb goat cheese. Cornmeal crust is good.

I made this for a potluck. Even those that don't like goat cheese loved it! What a treat - it vanished.

This dish was not a hit at my dinner party. It was gratuitously rich and somewhat bland. The cornmeal crust was nice & crumbly & easy to make. I will make that again but with a different filling. Everyone prefered the Zucchini, Sundried Tomato & Mozzarella tart, also from Epi.com, which was excellent.

Loved it. I put very thinly sliced onion on the bottom of the shell which added an extra zing. My husband who is recovering from surgery has had very little appetite for anything lately, however this dish did the trick. He had seconds.

Simply delicious, and the crust was fantastic! This had a real summer taste to it with the basil. I will definitely make this again. I made this in a round fluted tart pan, and used grape tomatoes, it turned out beautifully, I should have taken a picture!

One of my favorite summer "Sunday dinner" dishes. I've probably made it at least 5 times, and I rarely make anything twice. The crust might be the best part of this tart; it's crumbly and delicate, and really does melt in your mouth! I have never changed a thing about this recipe; I love the simple, almost rustic flavors together. A note; I usually halve the recipe and make it in a 8" tart pan. Baking time is pretty much the same. It's the perfect amount for 2 people, served with a big salad with balsamic vinaigrette and pine nuts.

This is a great recipe for a party (I just made it for our block party). It's beautiful, delicious, and yields a lot of servings without requiring detailed preparation for each individual piece. I thought the balance of flavors was just right, and didn't feel a need to alter anything.

I read the reviews and added a clove of crushed garlic to the custard. It was a wonderful tart with perfect textured crust and custard. I used golden and red grape tomatoes. Lovely.

I'd make this again, and I did think it was good. However, the "Heirloom Tomato and Goat Cheese Tart" recipe (also found on epi.com) is a lot better.

Good recipe but not outstanding. I added a tablespoon or so of Herbes de Provence to the crust dough, and added a clove of crushed garlic, some chopped green onions and doubled the basil for the custard. Don't make this recipe unless you have excellent tomatoes.

This is a wonderful dish. I used it in conjunction with a number of dishes to make the perfect french picnic. A must do.

At my recent cocktail party for fifty people, this was the most requested recipe. I had fifteen different dishes. This tart was gone first. While making the crust I was a little worried at how mushy the crust seemed. But, it turned out really well. A really great recipe.

Very nice idea, and lovely presentation. I added choppped fresh herbs to the crust mixture (makes it a little less bland)and doubled the amount of fresh basil in the custard. I think this would be very nice for a brunch, though I served this as a first course for dinner and it was fine.

I used this tart as part of a "gourmet dinner" menu for a dinner club that has been meeting for 25 years. All 5 of the wives in the group have degrees in Home Economics, and our standards are quite high. We used this recipe exactly as originally written, including the cornmeal crust. Something tells I will use it many more times!

for some reason i don't think that the receipe called for enough goat cheese or too few tomatoes. i would try it again but make some adjustments to the receipe -

I have made this recipe several times, tweaking it with each preparation and always to rave reviews. I usually substitute some cream cheese for part of the goat cheese (say 5 ounces goat cheese plus 3 ounces cream cheese.) I just made it last weekend for a dinner party and inadvertently omitted the butter in the custard. I think it made it even better: the tart still set up nicely and all I was left with was a clean plate!

Very easy to make and delicious. Great dish for entertaining and looks impressive.
