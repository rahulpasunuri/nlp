I wanted to try this recipe on its own and it was great by itself. I will be trying it on chops soon, my roommate plans on tossing it on his steak tomorrow as we had some leftover. I didn't have the problem the first writer described, but it did take longer than the recipe indicated. I just turned up the heat a bit and waited patiently.

Even though I used high-quality smoked slab bacon, the process of simmering it in chicken broth made a mess that never really reduced since the fat in the bacon melted into the pot. Next time, I'd saute the bacon to render/remove the fat, then add the bacon to the relish

Incredible!!! I served it with mashed potatoes with goatcheese and herbs and sauted chard and spinach! Got great reviews from my guests. A definite keeper.

Made these pork chops with this relish for Christmas Eve. Rave reviews. It's delicious. Made my own pomegranate molasses by boiling down the juice with some lemon juice and sugar.
