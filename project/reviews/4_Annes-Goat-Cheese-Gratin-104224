I did this as an appetizer for our Provencial Christmas. It rocked!! My husband, who is not an olive or goat cheese lover had seconds!! I will most definitely do this again.

Wonderfully good flavor combination. I have also used the cheese and herb mixture as a filling for ravioli with the tomato sauce and black olives as the sauce. More work but just as good.

God, this was SO GOOD. And SO easy to make too. Amazing appetizer. No one else could stop eating it either, I mean, unless I was hogging the plate myself, holding it up to my face like a pig. And with the red zin, it was amazing...I can eat this forever.

I was suprised by how tasty this dish was. It was so simple and quick to make yet tasted almost heavenly. It also has a beautiful presentation if you actually bake it in the individual dishes. It does need to be served with bread because it's all flavor and not much substance. Also, I just left out the hyssop but it didn't hurt the taste any from what I could tell. I would definately recommend that anyone, who is a fan of goat cheese, try this dish.

We substituted fresh tomatoes for tomato sauce(it's August.)And we're wondering what hyssop is??.. We had no idea so we used some herbes de Provence instead. It was tasty and delicious with just a piquant edge from the olives and fresh tomatoes. It really was like pizza without the crust like she says (except we used some fresh baguette to mop up and it was more like pizza in seperate sections.)

While the dish came out unexpectedly mushy, it was very tasty. No problem, we served it with baguette and used it as a spread. We also substituted a few leaves of sage for the hyssop. It went great with the red zinfandel that we served.

Oh = how fun is this!!! I didn't realize until I started cooking that I didn't have tomato sauce (homemade or otherwise) so I improvised with a can of crushed tomatoes, rosemary, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, THEN I realized I didn't have good quality olives so I used olive salad from COSTCO. Totally delicious anyway -

This sounds delicious...Does anyone have a good herb substitution for the hyssop? Mint, perhaps?

I absolutely loved this recipe-made it without the olives and thought it was faulous!
