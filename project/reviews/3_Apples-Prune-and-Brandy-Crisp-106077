Smelled wonderful while cooking in the oven. Very good with vanilla ice cream. Liked the crunchy topping. Didn't need that much prunes but otherwise very good dish.

This is absolutely yummy! I used lemon essence prunes and because I only had about half the amount required, I threw in a few peach flavored crasins. I soaked them in the brandy and folled the recipe from there on. Lovely!

This was good and the brandied prunes made a nice addition, but it was not particulary better than any traditional apple crisp recipe found in, say Betty Crocker's 1950's classic. When I take the time to make a dessert (and commit to the extra calorie consumption) I would prefer something truly wonderful.
