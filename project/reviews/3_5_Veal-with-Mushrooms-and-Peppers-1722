I thought this was quite tasty, though of course I modified it just a bit. The veal stew meat was lean so I had no problem with it being greasy. I had yellow bell pepper instead of red on hand, and no marsala so used cooking sherry instead. I didn't have the patience to put it in the oven but simmered covered on top of the stove for about 10 minutes, then served over brown rice. Not a lot of color but a lot of flavor - I'd definitely make it again.

This is a flavorful recipe that is straight forward to make, however for some reason I find it lacking. I took a few things from earlier reviews and added 2 medium shallots, sauted before the mushrooms, and added a cup of chopped green beans (that I had in the fridge) with the mushrooms. It came out very tender with a sweet start and a hot finish. Next time I'll add something like artichoke hearts and possibly carrots to punch it up a bit.

This recipe rivals the flavorful recipes I have found in neighborhood Italian restaurants. And, that's high praise. I added roasted bell peppers and a medium diced onion that I sweated in a small amount of olive oil. After removing the onions, I browned the veal. For an extra flavor punch, I substituted for the chicken broth a 14 1/2 ounce can of tomato sauce. After one hour twenty minutes, it was ready to enjoy over a bed of pasta. Oh, by the way, I also added a teaspoon dried thyme before putting it into the oven. This is a good basic recipe!

Good basic recipe in need of fixes. I added the following: 8 ounces chicken broth, instead of 1/2 cup; one small diced onion; 1 teaspoon dried thyme, plus several fresh thyme sprigs last 15 minutes of baking. Also, baked entire time, instead of removing it to stovetop last 20 minutes. No greasy feel to dish, at all!

The unusual ingredients peaked my interest. Would use less all spice next time, but will definitely make this veal stew rendition again

Very tender meat. I was looking for a recipe to use some fresh chanterelles and this turned out very good. I served it on sweet potatoes, coupled with the sweeter wine it was a good combo.

Keeping in mind other reviews saying this dish was bland, I added salt & pepper while browing the veal, and a dash to the mushrooms and peppers. Also, did not use low-salt chicken broth. Added peas during the last step (stove top) and this dish was great! A keeper!

Oh my, who were the greasy reviewers, I wonder (?) the recipe: we just finished having it for dinner... okay, i cheated, with a T. of tomato paste at the end (my husband's credo---owing to an Italian grandmother---is "anything that tastes good without tomato will taste better with tomato"). Served over egg noodles. Squizito!

I followed the recipe as-is without any alteration and thought it was a bit bland. Although, it smelled fabulous when I was cooking and the dish looked colorful with the red bell pepper, it is still missing something to the taste. I served this over white rice and my boyfriend thought it tasted delicious. I think he was just too hungry and didn't realize how flavorless it was.

Like others that reviewed this, it is a little greasy. Good hearty meal. I used white and portabella mushrooms. The dish is best if you make it the night before. This will give you an opportunity to spoon off some of the grease.

This was very delicious and easy to make. I recommend it. It was just spicy enough with great flavor. My house smelled great.

I made this last night for a dinner party of 6 and found it to be bland. I used 1 1/2# veal, 24 mushrooms, 2 med red bell peppers, and LOTS of garlic. I used a total of 4 T. olive oil, but increased the Marsala to 10 oz., and added about 1 cup chicken broth. I thought I was generous with salt and pepper but it just needs more spice and I'm not sure what. The consistency was great, the meat was very tender, and it had color - I also added peas for interest, flavor, & color. Everyone including my husband said it was delicious but I think they were being polite. I served it over egg noodles instead of rice. Maybe some shallots would help??

I have made this several times to rave reviews.

I guess I'm the outlier. The meat was very tender, but there was a little too much oregano for my taste, and it was somewhat greasy even though I used high quality veal stew meat. It all comes out one color, not very interesting looking. I added peas just to get some contrast, but it really didn't seem worth making again.

My whole family loves this one. I have used veal chops instead of stew meat, tastes just as good. Definately a keeper.

Definitely a keeper! I most certainly used more olive oil than specified to saute the veal and vegetables...also used 1# mushroom. Recommend a full cup of chicken broth; an hour in the oven reduced the stew to the brink of too done. But with 1 cup, it was tender and utterly delicious. Tastes quite rich!

This is truly terrific. Definitely a keeper.

When you double the recipe, you need much more oil but not twice the wine - Very delicious!

Very tasty and there was plenty enough liquid.

Worth trying.Use one cup of chicken broth to cook one hour.

I have been making this recipe a few times every year since 1992. Tastes and smells exotic from the allspice and Marsala. We love it on couscous and even mashed potatoes instead of the rice.
