Love these! I sub chili oil for half the oil for a spicier version. These are then used as a base for smoked salmon topped with a mix of cream cheese, capers, red onion and dill. So much more exotic than crackers!

We loved these! The key is to use more sesame seeds--and they don't have to be toasted--and more salt than the recipe calls for. You could also skip the seeds and use parmesan and rosemary instead. Or make sweet ones with cardamom and superfine sugar.

Easy side for grilled asian pork and edamame...my kids love them too. Easily varied - we used cinnamon sugar and served them with ice cream. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent as chips w/o the added grease. I started out as the recipe directed, but didn't like the cornstarch look on the crisps when I took them out of the oven. I switched over to just using olive oil spiked with chili flakes to give a bit of heat, sprinkled the wonton with salt & a wide variety of herbs. Guests loved them.

Yummy... very good with goat cheese, and easy to make. I'm going to try them with smoked salmon and wasabi sauce next time.

These are fantastic! I made them the first time as the recipe suggests, but plan to spice things up a bit too. These go well with everything...hummus, cheese, goat cheese spread.

I mixed up the same oil/cornstarch amount, but got about 70 crisps out of it instead of the 24 this recipe implies. Used sesame seeds, freshly ground pepper, and five spice powder on different batches, though you could do curry or parmesan and herbs, any seasonings would work. These do burn quickly, though, so watch them. Much lighter than chips!

Nothing special on their own- but wonderful with dips. I served with a Sichuan style eggplant dip, and they went way too fast. Just watch for the cooking time- they burn VERY easily- the fried version on this website is very good as well.

I've made these several times and always to rave reviews. Easy, fast, and fairly healthy.

These are so simple, quick, and delicious. I have made these many times as a crunchy snack or side accompaniment for a full meal.

First, to the cook from Calgary - THANK YOU! If you want to abuse each other, find another forum. Second, I've tried it with both oil and unsalted butter, and have to admit there is little difference because the sesame seeds themselves are so buttery. If you would like something more, add a little crushed red pepper, just a pinch, or a pinch of cayenne.

People, do realize that one's like or dislike of a food has little to do with the "civility" of their palate and more to do with personal taste. We shouldn't be reviewing the reviews here, just the recipes. So back to topic - I liked these. Next time I will use butter though for a richer flavour.

People who don't like the ease and taste of this are not seeing the whole pix. I began doing something similar 30+ years ago and guests go wild over them. Mine were done with seasoned salt and parmesan cheese topping - for kids use cinnamon sugar. Guests leave and go to the store for ingredients to make more and pig out!

Made these the day before; super simple, and our guest gobbled them all up.

What does kangaroo meat have to do with making wonton crisps? Just wondering.

Rating: 3
Thought I might mention that Aussies don't eat kangaroo; they are considered to be pests in this country. It's the gullible yankee tourists that pay a fortune to eat what we consider the equivalent to rats and foxes.

This are great, for the life of me I don't know why anyone would even say yuk without trying it. I beg you, just try them

Good...the same recipe works just as well with flour tortillas...maybe even a little better.

for those who say yuk - you haven't tried. Haven't you ever put corn starch in anything before? This is very easy and very tasty. My guests couldn't get enough.

For those who say Yuk. Why would you say that? You eat pretzels right? Just think of these as Chinese Pretzels. Not much different.
