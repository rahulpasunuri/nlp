This is definitely a keeper. At first I was leary re: the amount of chicken broth and how runny I was afraid the sauce would be. Bolstered by so many positive reviews I served it to guests last night to raves. Other than using frozen shrimp I didn't change a thing. Really excellent. Served it with Antipasto Salad (Gourmet, Jan 2003). So easy and so delicious.

We had this for dinner, and absolutely loved it! The flavors were wonderful and it was very easy to make. It looked very impressive on the plate, and I would definitely serve it to guests. The only change I made was to use 3 tablespoons of tomato paste since that was what I had left in my fridge. Wonderful dish! Can't wait to make it again.

Oh wow. Yum Yum Yum. I'm adding this to my list of go-to recipes. I took some advice from another reviewer and used the whole 6 oz can of tomato paste. Because really, who has use for a half can of tomato paste? Not this girl. And it didn't make too much of a difference, maybe a little more tomato flavor, but that can't be wrong. I also skimped a little on the shrimp. Being a frugal 20 something, I opted for 3/4 lb. Kind of wishing I had more shrimp, but still tastes divine. And oh boy am I am happy that it is Spring and asparagus season. This is an easy and delicious meal--You'd be a fool not to try!

WOW!!! Followed this to the letter.. incredible! I spent the last couple days in my little town of Hastings Michigan looking for sun dried tomatoes.. even considered trying to use tomatoes and olive oil to substitute. GLAD I DIDN'T! The Toms and the oil that they are packed in combined with the red pepper create an amazing foreground. Then the basil and garlic kick in. Cooking times are spot on in this recipe. The sauce cooks up perfectly in 6 minutes. Make this.. Period!

Another great pasta recipe. I could live on pasta! Anyway, I made a couple of changes to the recipe, only because I didn't have asparagus on hand. I used frozen peas instead. I also made this without the wine, as I don't like to cook with alcohol when my children are going to be eating it. I know the alcohol "cooks out," but still--I omit for my children's sake.

I've made this several times now, making slight variations each time. Unfortunately, I just can't make it click, considering the cost of the shrimp. Close but no cigar. Eliminated from my recipes.

Have made this several times now, and you can go quick and easy, with frozen shrimp, sauce from a jar, etc., as long as broth and enough sun-dried tomatoes are there; the flavors still work. Fresh shrimp, basil, and a bit of garlic oil are the step-up that allows you to embellish with just about any other veg or garnish you like, and still have a winner. Leftovers will create food envy at the work lunchroom.

This dish was very tasty, and even my picky 4- year-olds liked it. Didn't have the tomatoes but was fine without them. Took other reviewers advice and doubled the garlic, added almost a whole can of tomato paste and sauce was fine.

Rating: 1
The flavors do NOT go well together. If you're going to spend the money and time to make this, there are many other recipes far more deserving. BUT, it's not really that surprising considering the woman who came up with this recipe is not a chef by any means. I am very surprised this was in Bon Appetit.

I made this last night for a quick family dinner and it turned out EXCELLENT. I added 1 can of artichoke hearts to the asparagus (which I chopped up). I used frozen shrimp from Costco and just poured off the extra juice before adding the other ingredients. I can't wait to heat up the leftovers tonight.

I thought this was quite good and the kids even liked it. I thought the red pepper added some kick. The only substitutions I made were fresh parsley for basil and extra chicken broth instead of white wine as that's what I had. I also used a whole can of tomato paste. I warmed up the leftovers the next two days for work and it was still delcious.

Excellant. Love the asparagus cooked in the sun dried tomatoe oil. A little too time consuming, but worth it for something different once in a while. Will increase sauce ingredients and use 2 cups of broth and whole can of tomatoe paste next time for more and thicker sauce. Will definately make this again.

Also forgot to mention that I used four cloves of garlic!

This was a great recipe -- so quick and easy; perfect for a weekday meal! I didn't have fresh basil so I used about a teaspoon of dried Italian seasoning. I didn't have tomato paste so substituted sun-dried tomato pesto and added about a teaspoon of grated parmesan to help thicken the sauce. Also used fettucine instead of penne. Delicious!

I love the way the shrimp in this dish take on such a wonderful flavor from the gralic, sun dried tomatoes, basil, oregano and red pepper. The red pepper gave just the right amount of zip to the dish. Believe it or not, my local supermarket did not have asparagus, so I substituted fresh haricot verts and the dish came out great! You just need to cook the green beans for a little longer to get them crisp-tender. I think this can feed more than the 4 people it states, we had lots of left-overs.

Very easy and delicious. I didn't have any basil so I doubled the oregano.

I was looking for an easy recipe for shrimp and stumbled upon this. I decided to make it even though I was missing some ingredients, but it still turned out really, really great! I substituted the fresh basil with a frozen minced basil and just used a few tablespoons. I also added more garlic and used tomatoe sauce instread of tomatoe paste. I ended up boiling the wine/broth mixture for much longer than it said to (about 15 minutes). I am planning to make this for a casual dinner party!

This recipe has some good bones, and the idea of sauteeing the asparagus in the tomato oil is inspired. But the recipe needs some work to get it to 3 or 4 forks. As written, it lacks zing or anything special. Sun dried tomatoes, garlic, basil, and oregano are great additions to the asparagus, but - as many said - the amounts need to be doubled or tripled. And then the broth should be cut down so that those great flavors are not so diluted.

Rating: 2
This recipe sounds great, but for me, it tasted bland. If I make it again, I would probably add more sun-dried tomatoes. The dish just didn't have enough "zing" to it.

Rating: 4
This dish is very simple to make. I sauteed the asparagus just before my guests arrived (great idea to use the oil from the sundried tomatoes), and had the fresh basil, sundried tomatoes, and garlic sliced/chopped and ready to go on the side. It does take some prep time just before serving, and so be prepared to leave your guests alone for about 20 minutes (the only down side). I used farfalle instead of penne, and served it with garlic bread and a simple salad with oil and vinegar topped with gorganzola crumbles. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
I loved it! Made it with asparagas and mushrooms, forgot the basil.. Will have to add next time. Now I've got a new favorite.

Rating: 4
This recipe was excellent. I was concerned about the consistency issue, so I only used 1 Cup low-sodium chicken broth and added 3/4 Cup heavy cream and simmered for the called-for 6 minutes. The sauce did appear thin, but definately wasn't once everything, including the cheese, was combined.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe just as written and it was very good. It took more kitchen time than I had thought (probably because I had to peel and devein the shrimp). I would probably make this again, but not for guests, since your needed to attend to preparation rather than attending to guests.

Rating: 3
I have made this recipe as it is and it's delicious. My husband requested it again and I hadn't all the ingredients so I made these substitutions - I had no asparagus so used half and half broccoli and mushrooms, used dried basil, red wine instead of white and a combination of feta cheese and sour cream as I was out of parmesan. Served it over angel hair pasta and think it was even better than the original.

Rating: 3
Prepared this dish exactly as the recipe stated. Did have some trouble getting the sauce to thicken up in the pan. I cooked it a few minutes longer and when added to the pasta and final ingredients, it thickened up nicely. The longer the dish sat on the table, the better it tasted... but it didn't sit for too long! YUM!

I made this dish for company - everyone loved it! I did make a few modifications: added 4 oz. of sliced portabella mushrooms , sauted with the asparagus along w/ tb. of butter. Then added 1/4 heavy cream and equal portion 1Tb. cornstarch/water to thicken sauce near the end.

Rating: 3
We really enjoyed this dinner! I had a bit of trouble getting the sauce to thicken, so I added about another Tbsp. of tomato paste, whisked it a bit, then added some baking powder,(about 1 tsp.) then continued to whisk. The additions did the trick. While we were very happy with the result, I think I would add maybe 1-2 more garlic cloves (we LOVE garlic), and a dash more of the hot pepper. But, overall, a great week-night dish!!!

Very nice dish! Made a few suggested modifications: added more garlic and red pepper, baby bella mushrooms, and 1/2 can of tomato paste. The sauce was very runny, which made me nervous, so I boiled it a bit longer. Sorry I did, because the dish was a bit dry! Next time I will stick to the 6 minutes.

This is one of those great easy recipes that is a fantastic base for experimenting. I used oyster mushrooms instead of asparagus (market had some old wilted asparagus I didn't want to waste the dish on) and it turned out great. The sauce was mix between a fresh tomato sauce and mushroom sauce. Very tasty and an interesting variation. Can't wait to experiment w/ feta cheese next time :-)

This was fantastic, and will definitely make it again. I had no trouble reducing the sauce, I did use about half a small can of tomato paste and used 5 cloves garlic. I only had a pound of shimp left in the freeze from last trip to the GA coast that I bought fresh off the boat, I'm thinking of Substituting a couple chipoltes in adobo sauce for the pepper flakes as I think it would add some depth to the sauce.

This was a great and easy dish. Many thanks to Lisa who invented it. The only change I made was to use a bit more tomato paste (about 1/2 a standard can) as I prefer my sauce a little thicker and changed the pasta to linguini rather than penne. I also used 20-25 count shrimp. This is a winner and I look forward to enjoying it again with dinner guests.

Very delicious. Followed recipe exactly except I boiled sauce a little longer, maybe 8 minutes, and it coated pasta nicely. Agree with previous reviewers that this dish would be good with chicken or scallops instead of shrimp. Served two and I have a generous amount of leftovers for lunches or another dinner.

Loved it! Not only fast & easy, but most can be made ahead. I made 1 1/2 times the sauce & used a full pound of penne. It's just as good the next day, if not better. Hot, cold, room temp--good recipe! Forgot the suggested toasted pine nuts, but they were good on it cold for lunch the next day. Combination of parm & feta a good one.

I was weary after reading some of the reviews, especially thinking it wouldn't be "saucy" enough. But it was absolutely delicious. The key to the sauce is to really boil it. It's not going to thicking completely, but it won't be watery at all. Also, the cheese helps to thicken it once you add that at the end. The mix of flavors is wonderful. I can see this becoming a staple.

I was unhappy with the sauce, it wouldn't thicken. Luckly I used angel hair instead of penne or the liquid never would've adhered to the pasta. Over all though the recipe was good though. If anyone would liek to write me to let me know about how they thickend their sauce that would be lovely.

Will try again using various types of shellfish and/or fish.
