Really delicious, if not very healthy for a salad. My husband loved it. We added croutons to complete the sandwich theme.

There's nothing wrong with this recipe, per se, I just thought it was a little bit lackluster, and I agree with a previous reviewer that the "warm bacon dripping and mayonnaise" dressing was pretty unappetizing. I won't be making this one again.

This was my "go to" salad this summer. Looks best with baby heirloom tomatoes. I added diced red onion but otherwise followed the recipe. Easy and great flavor!

Sautéed mayonnaise? Dressing made with bacon fat? UGH! The dressing was horrid. And the salad itself was not very imaginative with only the three ingredients of lettuce, tomatoes and bacon.

So good!

A crowd-pleaser! Great recipe - especially in the summer when there are sweet tomatoes on hand.

Wonderfully simple, wonderfully fresh. I added some shredded cheese, and used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine, and still lovely.

Loved the salad, but like a previous reviewer my aioli dressing didn't come together very well and I think it may have been because I used the olive oil mayo which is lighter than even the light mayo. I would definitely make it again w/ reg. mayo.

This salad was easy to make and my husband loved it. I presented it as "a man's salad" and he gobbled it up. I added avocado (I'm a California girl -- I just can't help myself) and it was terrific.

I used light mayo because its what I had on hand. I think it needs the full-fat version for better flavor. The vinegar was a tad overwhelming with the lighter mayo. I also used diced tomatoes rather than cherry - but they were fresh off the vine, so it was a fabulous substitution!

I liked this, too. Made exactly as written, and thought it was an easy, light supper. Liked grilling slices of rustic Italian bread with a little olive oil brushed on.

I really liked this.But w/ all new recipes or old I guess, there must come a little tweaking to make it your own.I added some sliced mushrooms with the tomatoes.Also a little more garlic(I love garlic) and threw in grilled chicken.When I tossed it all together I added crumbled goat cheese and a tiny bit of shredded mozzarella.It would be great on it's own, I just like having fun with my recipes!
