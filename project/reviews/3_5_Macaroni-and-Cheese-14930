The best macaroni and cheese I've ever made or had anywhere! My mom loved it and asked for the recipe (she is an amazing cook). I use only about 1/4 tsp dried hot red pepper flakes as I have kids and I find that I don't need to add the whole 1 cup of reserved pasta water (usually about 1/2 cup is all I use). Weigh the cheese so the quantity is right!!! I often use a combo of sharp cheddar, smoked cheddar and parmesan... about 4 ounces of smoked and aged cheddar really adds a nice flavour. We only make this every 1-2 months. Once you see how much cheese goes in, you'll know why! This will be a treasured family recipe for many years!

Scrumptious! This is a crowd pleaser and incredibly easy. You can substitute some gruyere for the cheddar but is totally unnecessary since the original recipe is perfection.

My litle, picky, grandson is visiting so I made this for him tonight. I followed others advise and added the shallot, along with grated nutmeg to the roux, along with using milk instead of cream. This is a creamy, bubbly tasty macncheese, that can be pushed up a notch or two and made richer, more complex. Or, like tonight, make it simple,for a picky lil man.

VERRRRY yummy!!! My daughter and I made this last night and our family devoured it! They couldn't stop "mmmmm-ing"! Very easy to make, too. A nice weeknight go-to meal...

Excellent Mac 'n Cheese. Added some finely chopped shallots browned in butter, used 1/2 sharp & half white cheddar, and did not use reserved water from macaroni (forgot to save it & thought consistency was perfect without it, not sure what it would have done to it so will leave it out next time).

I make this for every family function and people rave. Replaced the mustard and hot pepper flakes with Wasabi to go with the panko. *I* think it's better that way.

DELICIOUS. I doubled this recipe on my first attempt since I had guests. After finishing I realized I didn't need to double the topping portion, because the "surface area" of my dish is still the same, so we did have a BIT much in the way of panko crumbs, but that's my fault. I am not sure why the need for reserving any of the noodle water? I THINK I will probably NOT do that next time, but man this recipe tastest absolutely delicious. I'm so happy I tried it, and it'll be a regular part of our repertoire now!

This turned out super good. It was my first time making mac & cheese (silly, i know), and I will for sure make it again. I added green chile's to the sauce when it was simmering, and then added bacon when I put the sauce and noodles together. Makes good leftovers and it heats up well. The cheese sauce never got grainy which is a good sign it's a great recipe.

Great recipe! Reduced the crumb topping by half. The sauce didn't need the extra cooking; it was creamy with out it. This is the easy,classic mac and cheese I've been looking for.

This is my standard, go-to Mac & Cheese recipe. The only change I make is to use Italian-seasoned Panko without any butter or cheese for the topping, and I use 2% milk instead of whole plus cream. It is a huge hit with the extended family. I imagine it's even better prepared as written.

I love this mac and cheese! The mustard adds a distinct flavor, despite the huge amount of cheese, the dish isn't overwhelmingly cheesy.

....The best mac and cheese recipe. I used equal parts Smoked Cheddar and Extra Sharp Cheddar. Panko topping was great.

Best Mac & Cheese I've ever made or eaten. I substituted smoked cheddar and smoked gouda in equal parts, otherwise, I prepared the recipe as directed. The sauce is richa nd creamy and the panko breadcrumbs are perfect when toasted.

This macaroni and cheese recipe is excellent. The panko topping adds a lot flavor that other macaroni and cheese recipes do not have. I wouldn't suggest using dry bread crumbs, go the extra distance and find panko. I normal add 3 teaspoons of Dijon mustard; it gives it a little more edge. If you are looking for a crowd pleaser, make this dish, children will love this recipe!

This recipe was good but not great. Found there was too much sauce for the amount of macaroni. Mustard was strong tasting. Loved the addition of hot pepper flakes and panko. I would make this again but I would need to make some adjustments.

I made this as the "kid's dish" for my 2 year old daughter's birthday party. The adults gobbled it up as well. I doubled the recipe in all respects except I upped the macaroni to 2 lbs. By mistake I forgot to reserve the pasta water and add it in, and assembled it and refrigerated. Today before I baked it I sprinkled 1-ish cup of water on top of the dish and the consistency of the sauce was perfect.

I have never gotten so many complements (especially from my own lips) about a MNC recipe as I did with this. It had a dimension of sophistication (I also used 1/3 Gruyere) but homestyle comfort as well. I didn't use as much pasta water but instead made more cheese sauce. I never was one for crunchy toppings on MNC until I tried this perfectly crunchy , cheesy, buttery panko topping. Bravo!

Cut the recipe in half and used really large elbows, and eyeballed most of the dry ingredients, added paprika and oregeno to the topping, best mac-n-cheese I have ever made!

This was okay but I think I will stick with my own version which doesn't include mustard, pasta water, or breadcrumbs. I did like the addition of the red pepper flakes and will try that with my own recipe.

This is the best baked mac and cheese dish I have found. The others I tried were all bland but this has a really nice flavor. It is a little time concuming to make, but in my opinion, completely worth it. I always make a huge batch because my family loves itand even the leftovers are great!

My husband and I were inspired to make this after seeing a resurgence of macaroni and cheese on upscale restaurant menus. I tend to be a low cal cook, so when I see that much cheese in a recipe I freak out -- but of course, it wouldn't be mac and cheese without *cheese*!! ;) I only had nonfat milk in the house, so I used that instead of the whole milk and cream. It was quite juicy before baking so I left out the cooking water -- in spite of my modifications it was delicious! I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent! I made it without modification, and it was great. Your basic, yummy macaroni and cheese. The crunchy topping is *key*. Next time I may add some curry powder, some asiago, some leeks, not sure what!

My friend turned me on to this recipe. YUM! I doubled the recipe and made it for Easter Dinner at my home this spring. It was a huge hit ... and so rich that a table of 9 didn't even touch the 2nd pan! So, we all enjoyed leftovers for sometime.

This is the only recipe I use for homemade mac-n-cheese. Simple and incredible! Family and friends cannot get enough. I use lightly toasted whole wheat bread for the crumbs. I have used small shell pasta instead of elbow for a change.

Very basic recipe, good base to work off of. I'd make more sauce next time as mine was a little dry. Worth another effort.

Sorry, but this was not my favorite recipe for mac-n-cheese. I didn't care for all the bread crumbs. I was lucky and didn't get enough extra sharp cheese or it would have been way to bitter for me. Although I did like the creamy texture of the sauce, I think next time I will try 2/3 cheddar and 1/3 Gruyere (the cook from San jose's idea) for the sauce and cut the bread crumbs in half.

Rating: 2
It was good I used 2/3 cheddar and 1/3 Gruyere for the sauce. I also only used about 1/2 of the recommended topping. I think the ratio of breadcrumbs is too mmuch I would use less bread crumbs to cheese and butter for the topping next time. It also seems really runny but don't worry , add all of the water or it will be dry.

Rating: 2
I thought this was quite average. I'd change the breadcrumbs. It was too much and was about all you could taste. I did freeze half of it and will see if that changes anything.

Rating: 2
It was ok, I liked it, but it wasn't like "mom's". It turns out creamy, almost like a frozen mac-n-cheese. I used garlic bread crumbs, way too overpowering - don't do it! Also, the topping remaind just like breadcrumbs, not at all crunchy.

Is it just me or is this just regular old macaroni and cheese? Here is the easy and right way to make this AND with less calories (no less flavor). Cook the macaroni al dente and when you pour into a colander, drizzle a little olive oil in and toss. Cook the sauce as directed, but use NO cream. Instead, up the milk to a cup instead of the 3/4 c cream as a sub. If the cheese sauce seems a little thin as you add the cheese, dust the last handful of cheese with some flour then stir in the sauce. Cook down some. When sauce is done, pour mac in a sprayed dish (like Pam spray), pour the sauce on top (making sure the sauce is even and in all the crevices). Spread Panko and 1/2 the amount of cheese suggested on top and then drizzle with the melted butter. Good sharp cheese is key. Also make sure that roux is cooked. Broil at the end if not crusty on top.
