I substituted the brandy for 3T of tequila and it came out delicious.

I made this last year--and, while very good, mine is the best ever! I've posted it on my blog: http://www.fransfavs.com/2012/09/the-best-french-onion-soup/

Beware, it may take longer than 15 minutes to get the onions good and caramelized. Two tips; don't get impatient and always use a big enough pan. I didn't and I ended up with a soggy, oniony mess the first time. Re-did recipe with right pan, and with patience and it turned out super yummy and comforting.

Absolute keeper. Thought it would be hard to make but it wasn't at all. Made it for a dinner with friends and everyone raved about it.

The only distinguishing factor in this recipe is brandy - otherwise it's just salty beef stock and onions. And compared with other recipes, it's not enough to make it interesting.

Quick, but needs some modifications to be as good as I expect a French onion soup to be. Browning process is nice and fast. I suggest adding a clove or two of garlic prior to adding liquids. Needs more alcohol for flavor (I substituted about 1/3 c. Chardonnay for the brandy). Fresh thyme adds to the taste, needs a good amount of salt to bring out the flavors. Also, use a broiler to get the cheese good and brown instead of a hot oven, which takes too long and will likely just melt the cheese without browning.

Three starts because not flavorful enough on it's own. Added 1 cup vegetable stock, which was infused with white wine. Also tripled the amount of brandy. Added thyme, and needed significant salt. All of this brought the soup to that slightly sweet, salty, onion-y deliciousness that is French Onion Soup. Adding more alcohol was the key--every other recipe for same calls for white wine in significant amounts. Turned out 4 stars with additions.

Needs Worcester and a little cognac (over and above the brandy in the recipe), and also needs a bit of thickener. Flour added to the butter and onions would have improved it.

This recipe is both as easy (and fast) as they say it is, and as delicious as you would hope. I didn't have Brandy on hand so just had to cross my fingers and omit it - didn't seem to miss it, though if I had it next time I'd certainly be interested to see how it would add to the flavors.
