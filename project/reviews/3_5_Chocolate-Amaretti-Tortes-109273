I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover Amaretti Cookies and this was it! Its very elegant looking to serve at a party, and it was quick to make! I'll be doing this again!

I like the make ahead feature of this recipe but feel a good homemade batch of brownies would serve the same purpose and be a lot cheaper. Mine took 40 minutes in 3/4 cup custard cups.

My friends and I made this recipe for a welcome- home celebration. We were looking for more of a chocolatey taste. It turned out more almond-y, it has a very strong amaretti taste. We also found the texture a bit strange, a little gritty. The topping was also disappointing, until we added sugar. I'm not sure how much, we did it by taste. I would not recommend this.

This was quite easy and turned out beautifully. Very chocolatey and not too sweet. It needed about 15 minutes extra baking time and it came out looking exactly like the picture.

This was excellent. Very rich, with a taste of almond. Pretty presentation and a great do-ahead dinner party recipe.

One of the best desserts I have ever made. The presentation is easy. The recipe is easier than it first looks, too! I did not have Amaretti cookies but I had just made the almond spice butter cookies on this site -- so I used those cookies instead. Even though those cookies have cinnamon (and other spices), I still added the cinnamon in this recipe.

I tried it in medium muffin moulds as I wanted to have cup cakes and it makes about 1 doz muffins of 1/4c - 3/8c size.

This dessert is absolutely wonderful.My guests loved it. We topped each torte with a chocolate truffle, so not only did it taste good, it looked good. I will definitely make it again.
