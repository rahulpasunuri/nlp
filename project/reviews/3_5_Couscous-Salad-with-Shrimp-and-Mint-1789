Made this with quinoa instead of couscous. Upped the garlic to 5 as others suggested, and used 2 tbs of mint and 2 of fresh basil. Yum!

This was very refreshing for a hot summer evening as I served it cold. Could probably also serve warm. I followed the original recipe and made the following changes: Added chopped green bell pepper, cubed cucumber, and cilantro amongst the other ingredients. And took another reviewer's suggestion of sprinkling the shrimp on top instead of mixing in. Might want to let the couscous salad (minus shrimp) sit in the fridge for at least 24 hours next time. Mine was only marinating a few hours. Hubby raved, will make this again. Chicken might be a substitute. Elegant presentation.

Oops, wrong recipe!

This was yummy but I would never take it to a potluck or serve it to guests...all the yumminess is covered in the white yogurt sauce, making it a bit like gourmet mystery food.

This is a great recipe for hot summer days. Make it for lunch,light dinner, or to take to a potluck. My family and everyone I have made it for loves it. I have been making it for the past 5 years, and still come back for more.

This was tasty, but the shrimp got lost, quite literally, as grains of couscous adhered to it. I served this at a buffet lunch, and there was quite a lot left over, which was not the case with the other foods. I think that this would be better as a side dish or as a bed for grilled shrimp or other seafood, but the idea of mixing the shrimp in the salad just didn't work very well.

I enjoyed this recipe, but my husband, who is a couscous lover, said don't make it again. I never was fond of couscous and liked it better in this salad than any other way. I also bought garlic and herb flavored couscous for extra flavor. My hubby would prefer the same salad with pasta, which I will do. I used both dried mint and fresh basil and store bought cooked shrimp.

Hey Chef-boyami in Florida: get over yourself. Just tell us about the recipe. We don't need to hear about your fancy-ass condo and Gulf-of-Mexico breeze. Save it for the chat rooms. Great recipe, by the way - easy and delicious.

What a delightful profusion of colours, textures, and flavours. I sauteed a pound of tiger prawns in garlic and olive oil. I added the scrapings from the pan to the salad dressing. Being as everyone in my family loves garlic, I used 5 cloves in the recipe. I also substituted basil for the mint as I have a ton of it growing in my garden, and I'm not a big fan of mint. I'm looking forward to trying other variations on the recipe as well. I believe it would be lovely with lime juice instead of lemon and chick peas would go quite well with it too.

This is a great recipe. I had all of the ingredients in the house and was able to whip up a pretty incredible salad for my wife and I to enjoy when she got home from work on a Friday afternoon. It helped to have a nice breeze develop on this hot and muggy Florida day and allow us to eat dinner on the deck of our condo overlooking the Gulf of Mexico on Siesta Key. I used five regular size cloves of garlic instead of one large. I also used couscous pearls instead of the standard mideast brand that I usually use. I believe I would use this type again, but I would brown them in the pan as the container suggested. I also used a little more than a pound of large shrimp sauted in butter with a little triple sec. I may have used a little more green onion then recommended and I doubled the lemon juice and added on extra tablespoon of capers. This recipe lends itself to many different variations which we will experiment with in the future. It also met my most important qualifications of easy to prepare, easy to serve and memorable to those who inbibed.

Made out of desperation (shrimp in the freezer, box of couscous in the pantry), with dried mint instead of fresh, vidalia onions instead of scallions, etc., etc. Even so, it was wonderful. Perfect hot-weather fare.

This is delicous, simple, and one of the most colorful, pretty dishes I've done in a while. A plus . . . it travels well in tupperware. Brought it to an evening picnic and it was a hit. Used a little extra lemon and capers as suggested, served with a cucumber salad, crusty bread and white wine . . . yum!

This is a fresh-tasting and easy salad. Great for the hot days of summer because you barely have to turn the stove on. I added a little more lemon juice, as suggested and it was perfect! I added some leftover red bell pepper, also. Good for leftover peas too!

This is a delicious salad that I like to make for a light weekend lunch/snack. It tastes terrific the next day too. I followed the recipe and, like the previous reviewer, I would add more lemon juice next time to give it just a bit of extra bite. The mint gives it an interesting flavor without being overpowering.

I love this recipe and have used it many times. I always add more lemon and more capers to add more bite. Always use it for pot-luck events and get rave reviews!

This is a great recipe that I keep coming back to. It is also a nice dish to bring to a potluck. My daughter insists on having the leftovers for her lunch.
