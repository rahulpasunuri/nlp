Sorry, but this is NO brioche. This is more a soft roll type thing. It was delicious, but it isn't a brioche.

I wish I could watch this recipe being made with the paddle attachment because I nearly killed my stand-mixer! Switched to the dough hook after sugar was incorporated and the dough started climbing up the hook before I even started adding the butter. I felt all was lost but persevered and, much to my surprise, they turned out beautifully. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again. May be worthy of a 4th fork on my second try.

I have no idea what "shaggy" means in terms of dough but prior to adding eggs, my dough had a nice "crumb" but did not come together until I added the eggs. Speaking of eggs, it is very important that they are at room temperature; too cold and the yeast won't thrive. If you've forgotten to take the eggs out of the fridge - just put them in a pot of warm water for 5 minutes or so before use. After refrigeration, dough will be more like cookie dough than bread dough. Roll into long tube, cut in half. Cut each half into 1/3rds for a total of 6 pieces; cut each of the six pieces in half for a total of 12 pieces. Prepare according to recipe. I pulled mine out at exactly 20 minutes but will check at 15 minutes next time as they were *slightly* more brown-golden than golden-brown. Also, not as salty as I would like. I'd use 3 tsp of salt next time or use salted butter. The sugar seemed excessive initially but you can't taste it in the bread; I imagine it was just feeding the yeast. All-in-all, a great recipe - very flakey (though a tad dry), really easy, will definitely use again with slight modifications.

this is an excellent recipe. I've made multiple times - beautiful, professional looking and tasty. I also made the sugar tart with the same dough - perfect.

This recipe in great. I have made it several time and the whole family loves it. I've used both Gas and electric ovens, and for an electric oven, I reduced the temp to 375deg and baked 25min

I absolutely love these rolls! They do require some advanced planning to time properly, and last time I made them I nearly killed my mixer by trying to double the recipe, but I have gotten so many compliments on these. I didn't think I could make bread, but if you've got the patience I highly recommend these. Butter the muffin tin generously, they tend to stick for me. Really delicious with a little marmalade.

Everything came together exactly as the recipe said it would. I only had a six- muffin mufffin pan so I pulled out my mini muffin pan and rolled up a ball and dropped in each spot. My son loved the mini rolls and my husband loved the bubble top regular sized rolls. I recommend this to anyone with a stand mixer.

I don't have the time to make a lot of yeast breads but these rolls were easy to make and the result was delicious. I made 24 for Thanksgiving dinner for 10 and, they were gone by the time I served the entree. Yummy.

This was the first time I've made a bread that required yeast. I was nervous, but there was no need. Although time consuming, the end result was worth it. The mini brioches are quite impressive looking. Of note, I was a bit confused when adding the butter--I thought the entire butter-adding process was supposed to take 4 minutes total, but thinking back on it, I believe you should allow 4 minutes for each tablespoon to be combined. Patience is the key!

I can't believe how easy this was! Time consuming yes, but not difficult at all. That said I have to admit I did worry when my dough did not form "shaggy lumps", I added extra warm water, making it stickier than it should have been and thus more difficult to separate/roll into balls. Incredibly, this is also the first recipe of Dorie's I have ever used. I have torn out, bookmarked and dog eared many but never took the plunge. If she can guide me through brioche successfully then the possibilities are endless!

I haven't made brioche before, so I don't have much of a basis for comparison, but these were nice. I'm not sure if I'll make them again because of the overnight rise, but it was a fun experiment. Perhaps I don't like brioche enough to put the effort into making it. If you have a stand mixer, this is worth a try, though.

great brioche recipe I have made these twice to rave reviews. Would recommend using high quality flour (like king arthur) and organic butter. This recipe gave me the confidence to try other types of breads. They're very good w/some raspberry jam.

I've never made Brioches before, and these turned out as promised on the first try - so Yeah! I found that the mixing instructions were a bit off, needing more scraping and removing from paddle during butter-add period to ensure mixing is done as expected, and the final mixing took much less time than stated or I need to switch to a dough hook for the last 5 minutes of so. I also had browning after just 8 minutes, and they were certainly done after just 15, so keeping an eye on them was a must. End flavor was very buttery, and I might suggest an extra tablespoon of sugar or so if you like your Brioches with a hint of sweetness. Otherwise - nice texture and worth doing a few times to really figure it out.
