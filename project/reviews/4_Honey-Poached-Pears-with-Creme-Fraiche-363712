Great recipe. Works well with a good vanilla ice cream instead of the creme fraiche, for those with sweeter tastes. Added a slice of ginger the second time around and it gave it a little extra kick of flavor. It is great either way.

I used bartlett pears, which worked perfectly (or should I say pearfectly?) and the left over star anise for garnish. A really delicious and light dessert resting on sweet side.

Be careful not to boil the syrup too fast at the end, or you will end up with caramelized honey.Still good, but not what the cook intended.
