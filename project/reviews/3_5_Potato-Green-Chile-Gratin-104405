I made this dish for company and it was a hit. I followed the recipe from the magazine as I mentioned the discrepancies in a previous review. If you have a mandolin it is simple and quick to make. You'd think this would be really spicy but it is not. Some cheese may be a good addition.

This recipe is not written as listed in the magazine. The magazine calls for 1/16-inch potato slices and 1/4-inch strips of chile.It also calls for Yukon Gold potatoes.

Made these again, this time with all 5 chiles and 7 russets again. Everyone loved this gratin. This recipe is a keeper. Even the kids like it :)

I lived in NM for 9 years, and made this several times, often for a crowd. They are best with cream, and fresh roasted chiles made me rapturous! Made them in our new state with canned green chiles: the guests loved them, but we missed those fresh roasted chiles with all our hearts and taste buds.

I used 3 poblanos and 7 small/med russet potatoes, I sliced the potatoes 1/4 inch thin w/my mandoline and sliced the poblanos into thin 1/2 in strips (rajas.) I also sprinkled some crumbled cotija cheese on the top, about 2 Tablespoons. The result: AMAZING, everyone wanted seconds :)

I broiled the chiles, peeled the skin off, and then finely chopped them. I used about 3 good sized anaheim chiles and it was plenty spicy. I took the advice and sliced potatoes thinner, very important. I also added about 1 cup of reduced fat mexican cheese because I had it on hand. This was decadently delicious and I will definitely make it again!

Question: Are you chopping the chiles once they are roasted? I loved the taste but the chopped chiles were very unattractive. Neither recipe online or in the magazine mentiones what to do with the chiles once your roast and seed the chiles?

We tried this recipe twice. Following the other suggestions here, we cut the slices thinner. Both times we made this, the potatos did not cook until fully tender. We also found the taste to be rather bland.

This was the hit of an envening supper club. The couple that prepared it was uneasy about such thick potato slices but that is exactly what made it wonderful -well that and the roasted chiles.

Simple recipe with a just a bit of spice. The on-line recipe calls for slicing the potatoes 3/4" thick but the magazine has it at 1/8" is more like it. the mandoline isn't necessary but it makes short work of the slicing. I increased the poblanos to 8 (the ones I found were kinda small) and seasoned well with salt and pepper as I went.

Making it for the 3rd time. The 1st time, it accompanied the pork roast with port jus, which was an outstanding combo! The recipe calls for potato slices 3/4 inch thick, I cut them about 1/4 inch, didn't seem they would cook in time otherwise. Will try adding grated sharp provolone and havarti this time. Delicious!

I resisted my urge to improvise on this recipe and followed directions as written. It was ok, but I thought it lacked in flavor. Perhaps it needs herbs (like thyme or rosemary), additional spices (like chipotle or hot sauce), more garlic, or even some cheese.

Fantastic! I used fat free half and half and added some light cheddar cheese. Great side dish for Chipolte Shrimp or Grilled Swordfish Verde. Will be making this one for potlucks and special occasions.

This was a great recipe, but it took forever to cook. Next time, I'd just use canned chiles instead of taking the time to hand-roast the peppers. The flavor was great and my housemates devoured everything. I'll definitely do this one again!

Took this to a potluck and heard a few days later that someone at the party went in search of the recipe on this web site. What better compliment is there?

simple to make and so good! loved that it's so simple and tasty at the same time. nothing fancy or complicated. (you can make it without a mandoline if you don't have one, just slice the potatos THIN)

Easy and delicious. Would be wonderful with BBQ steak also.
