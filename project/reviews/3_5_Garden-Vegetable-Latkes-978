The dry ingredients were too much for me so my batter was hardly that. It was just wet grated veg (don't have a mandolin so I grated everything). Because of that it was harder to make into round patties so they were oblong but that's OK. I've never made latkes before but it's like a fritter really. I served with sour cream and apple sauce and def didn't make 16. More like 12. Anyway, it was OK but not sure if I'll make again.

This is my absolute favorite go to latke recipe and I have been making them to rave reviews since they appeard in the magazine in 1995. I don't always add the dill. The parsnips add great, sweet flavor. Draining the potatoes in a towel is the trick to crisp latkes, whatever recipe you use. I sometimes use whole wheat matzo meal instead of the flour.

I made this dish(without even trying it!) for a fancy event for 150 that I catered. Obviously, I more than tripled the recipe, but it very translated very well.Because I served these as a butlered appetizer, I didn't fry them up at the size recommended. This recipe will make four times the amount as an appetizer FYI. I garnished them with a whipped creme fraiche and two sprigs of chives per. They looked and tasted great.Some tips: if you're planning on making a huge batch (or even a slightly not so huge batch) cook just until crisp. They will continue to cook in the oven at the recommended temp. Conversely, you could cook them to proper doneness and just hold them at a lower temp(Obviously, you'll garnish upon removal.) They could have used a bit of salt prior to garnishing, but they look very pretty with all that color, and make up nice. For those of you that have never made a latke before (that would be me!!) don't panic that the mixture looks runny-it will be fine.***The more you make, the longer these will take, so plan ahead-it takes a bit of time to cook them unless you're just making the 12.

Sorry--additional suggestion. We found that when you are putting the potato mixture into the oil, first squeeze it into a tight ball. Place into the oil and let it cook for a few seconds then flatten it with a spatula. This keeps the potatoe together better. I used a coffee strainer to get out all the floaties that will make the oil taste taste old.

Yum Yum. Hubby & I made for our cooking group when we had a Jewish theme. The carrots and green onion give it a nice color. Could not find any fresh dill so I used dried dill. I added at least 2 T. and could barely taste the dill. Don't be afraid to add more dill--I think the deep frying over powers the dill flavor. It is messy! The yukon potatoes were great--drained easily and didn't seem to change color much. Enjoy!

these were tasty and easy--a nice change from the typical potato pancake.

Very Tasty! I had some problems with the measurements, since 2 large parsnips is a lot more than 8 ounces (it's more like 16), and 2 carrots is also somewhat more than 8 ounces. I went with the ounce measurements, it it was wonderful.

Great crowd pleaser. I have made these since I first read the recipe in 1995 and pull it out for company.

I made three types of Latkes and this was my personal favorite. It was my first time making latkes & no problems with this recipe. Good consistency and the carrots & parsnips add a yummy sweet flavor.

I loved the combination of vegetables-the parsnips gave it a great flavor. I didn't have time to fry them as latkes, so I added some oil to the mixture and baked it at 350 F for an hour as a kugel. It came out great!

Excellent. They are my favorite latke recipe. However, the pancakes tend to fall apart, so be careful.

Excellent!! I also used grated sweet potato along with the other veggies. I brought it to a New Year's Eve party and the adults and children loved it! I'd make this again.

This was my first latke attempt, and they were delicious! I didn't peel any of the vegetables and it really wasn't necessary. Thoroughly squeezing out all the moisture is key. I served them with yogurt to which I added dill, a little garlic, mint and black pepper. Wonderful!
