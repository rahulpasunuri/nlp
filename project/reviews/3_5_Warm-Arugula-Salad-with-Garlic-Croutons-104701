This salad was so so good! It was great for a simple, yet great tasting salad. If you are looking for something that is loaded with cheeses, nuts, and other rich flavors, this may not be the right one. That said, for being simple in ingredients, it was packed with flavor. This is a keeper.

I made this today. Didn't have the smoked mozzarella, so I used a shredded Italian blend I had on hand. Two onions seemed like a bit much. One good size vidalia worked well. I also warmed the vinegarette in a wide skillet. I added the arugula to the skillet and wilted it. Once it was slightly wilted, I added the cheese and stirred it all together. Using tongs, I moved the salad to a platter. Excess vinegarette stayed in the pan. Very good with a steak and a glass of red wine.

A lot of prep for a very disappointing salad. Very oily and garlicy and oniony. (And I like garlic!) and did I say oily?!? I will NEVER make this again!!!! A total waste of smoked mozzerella (my favorite cheese), not to mention olive oil. Save your time, calories, and ingredients for something better. If you're making the "tax day" menu, skip this part of it!! A regular salad would be fine. Maybe even steamed green beans or another bland vegetable since there is so much flavor in the rest of the meal.

The salad was a dissappointment. Flavors were too overpowering, especially the onions. Would not make it again.

Great salad!!! Everyone always comes back for more. I use regular mozz and spinach instead of arugula. A hit every time ; )

We enjoyed the vinaigrette a lot and the smoked mozzarella added an interesting flavor to the salad. Next time I won't scrimp on arugula that's on sale. That was the only part of the salad that wasn't good. (Didn't make the croutons)

Absolutely awesome!! Made it without the cheese - but it was almost better than the meal itself! (tilapia and eggplant) Worth every minute of prep time1

Strong, but delicious. Also I needed a one hour bath to diffuse the massive dose of garlic, onion, and shallot out of my skin. Oh well, its the price we pay for good food!

This meal was quite tasty, however, it seemed way too labor intensive! It was used as a side dish to pasta, and proved to be more work than the main dish itself. In addition, the smoked mozzerella is a great cheese, but is very overpowering. Since you work so hard to make these great tasting flavors, you want to be able to taste it. I would make this salad again, but maybe change the cheese to something more neutral.

i made this for a student dinner party- and it went over a treat. made exactly as the recipe said. but left each part separate for self serve- this solved the problem some people had of too much dressing. the croutons barely even made it to the meal though- perfect snacking food too. The dressing i found perfect to complement the strong taste of rocket. a little time consuming in retrospect, but easy to prepare everything ahead of time, so no worries. will definitely make this again. very unique taste from my regular vinaigrettes

This was wonderful! I like strong flavors, and these go very well together (to my tastes). I made this for a dinner party, and wanted something more elegant than usual, so the labor intensive part was not an issue for me. Ok, ok, I admit I did not make the croutons... oh, and I sauteed chopped garlic and sauteed the onion slices instead of roasting them... it was still FABULOUS, and a great way to cheat a little without missing anything. Cubed smoked mozzarella was the perfect finishing touch. Enjoy!

First off, I got pleanty of time to create in the kitchen, that being said, this recipe is WAY TOO labor intensive. I really wouldn't mind the time issue if this recipe was good, but it isn't. The flavors are intense when taseted one at a time, but as a group, together on your plate, its a seriously muddied composition. My fresh arugala could not be disserned under the heavy dressing. I used all top shelf ingredients including 1/4 cup of $70 a bottle (small bottle) balsamic and excellent olive oil, but even top shelf ingredients couldn't save this.

This salad has a perfect balance of flavors. Made it as printed (except reduced the oil to 2/3 C and sprinkled the arugula w/ a little salt before dressing). Served with grilled steaks w/ gorgonzola butter and roasted garlic baked polenta. Amazing!!

Ok. It's a bit of work/time to make (for a salad) but definitely worth it! Excellent salad. Used no variations. I usually make this salad with a simple main dish so I don't have too much going on - either that or I have to lay off the wine while I cook and who wants that?!

We added some seared scallops and pancetta to this. Good on a cold, winter's night.

JUST A QUICK TIP ON ALL THE RECIPES I LOOK AT THE REVIEWS BEFORE I MAKE THE RECIPE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE REVIEWS SAY IT MEDICORE I SKIP IT. SO I ONLY MAKE THE RECIPES THAT HAVE OUTSTANDING REVIEWS. I ENJOYED THIS SALAD. I FOUND IT SIMPLE BUT SO SOPHICATED. IT TASTE GREAT WITH A QUICHE.

AMAZING combination flavors. Easy to make the day before. The only issue is that the onions - the full rings - sort of clump up so some people got a lot of them less arugula. No one complained, though. Next time I will just the onions into 1/4 rings and see how that works.

the smoked mozzarella is a must. I loved this salad even the next day when the arugula was wited and soggy from the dressing. Next time I will use less oil. Try it with toasted pine nuts, it went very well together. can't coment on the onions, I left them out.

this was a variety of aromas and flavors i would never imagine together, but i am soooo excited to have discovered it!!!!

Wonderful! Rave reviews from all my guests. I used smoked provolone and 6 oz arugula due to the limitations of the supermarket (grr) but it was still terrific. I liked the way the basalmic complements the cheese. Will definitely serve again!

This salad is really wonderful. Everyone loved it. I added about 1 teaspoon sea salt to the finished dressing. I used smoked cheddar and smoked provolone instead of smoked mozzarella since I could not find any. I used only 6 oz. arugula (expensive) and about 4 oz. mixed spring greens.

Wonderful salad! I didn't have arugula, so used a mix of boston red and green leaf. Everyone loved it and I have given this recipe to at least 4 people.

I don't normally like warm salads but I tried this recipe anyway because of the rave reviews. It's quite a bit of work and the end result was less than stellar. The dressing was too heavy for the arugula so the leaves were quite soggy. I made it for a dinner party and hardly anyone ate it. Thankfully the rest of the dinner was good. I've removed the recipe from my files.

This salad is amazing. It is definately a lot of work. Also, I would use more arugala. It was a rather heavy on the dressing. What a combination from the arugula to the cheese. Not to mention the entire roasted garlic bulb! I can't imagine finding a salad that can compete with the flavors in this salad.

This is my absolute favorite salad. I used white cheddar from the WSU creamery and it was wonderful! I make this salad every time I entertain.

This salad was terrific. It took a bit more work with than most salads, but well worth it. I was unable to find smoked mozzarella and used provolone instead. I imagine that the smoked mozzarella would have made the salad even better. I'll be sure to make this one again.
