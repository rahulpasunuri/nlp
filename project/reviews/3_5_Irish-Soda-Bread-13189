I loved this recipe. I reduced the amount of Caraway to a teaspoon and used currants rather than raisins. The Caraway was very subtle but the flavor worked wonderfully. I also added 3 tbsp. sugar and used King Arthur bread flour, which makes a HUGE difference! Don't cheap out on the flour. Also made this in a stand mixer with a dough hook, which is hassle-free.

I halved this recipe, and it still turned out beautifully. I'm fond of caraway and raisins, so I left those measurements the same. The bread has a kind of cornbread-esque texture, which is great for dunking in soup. M. http://www.v-recipes.com/

I made this for the 4th time yesterday for St. Patrick's Day, but felt I needed to review it this time. I made a few changes to the recipe, as I always do. I deleted the carraway seeds because I know I don't like the taste, I added the 3 Tbsp brown and white sugar and I soaked golden raisins in whiskey overnight - Canadian Club to be exact, because it was what I had handy. The results were the best ever. To my surprise and delight even my husband and brother (who tend to be a little picky and profess to hate raisins) loved this. To qualify, I have never had any other soda bread so I can't compare to others, but I love this recipe because it is relatively easy and the results are sooo good!

Sorry to be a pain Frank from Alabama, but we had such a laugh when we first heard of "spotted dick", an English pudding made of suet and currants or raisins. I think "spotted dog" is sometimes used, but is not the correct term. Anyhow, "spotted dick" is funnier, no?!

None of the soda bread I had in Ireland had currants/raisins or carraway. Everyplace I went just made the soda bread plain. Adding fruit makes it something called spotted dog.

This bread is very good. The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks is that I didn't realize (duh) that I don't like caraway until I took my first bite after eagerly anticipating it's finish in the oven to realize that it was an unfavorable familiar taste. My mom loved it and said it is just like grandma's. Objectively, it's very good -- tasteful, well-proportioned, dense enough but not too much -- I just personally don't like caraway. Glad mom does. I gave her the new bottle of seeds I bought for these loaves! (And, I used 3 cups of regular flour and 1 cup of stone ground wheat and it produced a really super texture!) I will definitely make this again, just with different seeds.

This was so easy to make. Substituted buttermilk with greek yogurt and used currants. Results were fantastic. Even better the next day as toast. Everyone loved this.

I made this according to recipe and with whiskey soaked raisins. It is a good bread, but it doesn't taste like "Irish Soda Bread". This is my 3rd Irish Soda Bread recipe that I've made in 2 weeks and is my least favorite so far.

I substituted yogurt for buttermilk and the bread turned out very moist and dense with a nice crunchy crust. Will definitely make this again in the future.

Excellent and Easy. I soaked the currants overnight in whiskey. I used the dough hook on the mixer to mix the dry ingredients, then slowly added the buttermilk until it formed a ball. I didn't have to hand knead this sticky dough, so it made it even easier. The bread is just fine without sugar, though I may add some next time to see what I am missing.

My friends and family clamor for this every year. I brought some to work today and my co-workers swooned. I do add 3 TBS of regular and 3 TBS of brown sugar so it has just a hint of sweetness. So easy, so good!

I've been making this recipe for years, exactly as written. I don't like my bread sweet, so I'm fine without adding sugar. To me, the raisins add enough sweetness, and go wonderfully with the caraway. All my friends and family love this bread. My coworkers remind me every year to make it for them as well.

i first found this recipe upon its publication in 1991. i have made it ever since. no other irish soda bread will do for me. i do make 2 changes: i swap a handful of flour for a handful of wheat germ; i use organic whole milk yoghurt in place of buttermilk (when i am too lazy or forgetful at the grocers!). i prefer the dainty currents to raisins, but will use raisins in a pinch... i love the caraway and i love the lack of sweety-sweet taste most irish soda breads have. it can also make a really interesting sandwich bread, imho. (corned beef and horseradish w/watercress or arugula.)

I didn't have raisins or caraway seeds on hand, and only 3/4 of the needed amount of buttermik, but i was in the mood to try it so i went for it. i used whole milk for the rest of buttermilk. it was absolutely wonderful. we only had a tiny bit left the next day for toast!

I served this last night at a casual dinner. Very easy to make, unfortunately didn't have any raisens on hand, so had to do without. On the bright side, followed reviewer suggestions to add a tablespoon of sugar and I think that made up a bit for the lack of the sweetness the raisens would have added. So nice to have helpful suggestions with these reviews!

Concord, Mass. This Irish soda bread was tops. Both my parents came from Ireland and I have tried many recipes over the years. I made this twice - the first time the dough was almost too sticky to handle - I recommend 4 heaping cups of flour. I used low fat buttermilk which also made this a very healthy bread. It does go stale quickly but, as pointed out makes terrific toast (esp. w/ a little jam). I recommend 1 tbl of sugar.

I am married to a chef who is constantly reminding me that cooking is an art and baking is a science. I did not change nor substitute anything in this recipe, however did use raisins. This is the best soda bread I have ever had and all agree that have tasted it. This year I will be preparing this bread for around 75 to 100 people, so you know it has to be good, easy & delicious.

Rating: 4
The best Irish soda bread recipe I have. I make this at least two times in the weeks before St. Patrick's day every year and the results are always consistent. I make no substitutions but this year might shake things up a bit and add some sugar as other reviewers suggested. This doesn't keep very long but storage is never an issue in our house. I serve with Irish butter and a good quality strawberry jam; not sure if that makes for authentic soda bread but it's good nonetheless. Really good toasted, too.

I left out the caraway, halved the salt, and added 3 teaspoons total of sifted brown and white sugars. Also, I made one round loaf instead of two smaller ones, and made extra-sure I didn't overknead nor overbake. Hearty and slightly sweet results. Can't wait to have the rest with corned beef, if there's anything left :)

Rating: 3
Just the shortening-free soda bread recipe I was looking for. The raisins make it just sweet enough, but for those who like a sweeter soda bread, I added 1/4 c. sugar.(Anything sweeter is dessert,not bread.) Delicious toasted. Currants and caraway are more authentic, but not essential.

Rating: 3
Very good example and exactly what I expect when I think of "Irish Soda Bread". There are so many different recipes; with eggs, butter, oil, sweeteners, etc, but I like this one. Can make with or without the currants/caraway. When I made it with, I soaked the currants overnight in whiskey. With the whiskey that wasn't soaked up, I blended with butter as topping for the bread. Yum!

I have had requests for this recipe after serving the soda bread. I gave the exact recipe and my friend said it turned out too salty. I forgot that I usually cut the salt in half and it always turns out great!

This is the easiest bread I have ever made. It does quite well with variations too. If you don't have buttermilk or want less fat you can wisk together 1 cup yogurt and 1 cup milk (flavored, plain, fat, no fat, whatever you fancy). Also I used 1 cup mixed dried fruit (chopped up apricot, cranberries, raisins). I really enjoyed it. Those who want a sweeter taste can add a litte bit of sugar. Great all around. I baked mine at 375 for 30 minutes. Either way, 350 might be better, but it doesn't make much difference to me.

I just made this and it was very easy and is delicious. I did substitute 1 C whole wheat flour, added 4T of sugar (brown and white), and left out the caraway seeds. Next time I think I will try it with the caraway seeds, just to make it more interesting.

Excellent, fast, tasty, beautiful. Followed assorted reviewers suggestions: used dough attachment in Cuisinart until just blended, 6 T brown/white sugar, used assorted dried fruits soaked in boiling water for 1 minute (cherries, raisins, currants), greased hands with butter to form loaves.

This came out very good, with a cripsy outside, and warm gooey raisins on the inside...plus it is lowfat. The only problem was the seeds, which I thought screwed up the sweet taste, and added too much contrast. I will definitely mkae it again without the seeds.

I was very excited to find this recipe. A friend's sister makes it and sends to him, but won't give the recipe (sisters!!). I added 3 T.

I landed up trying this soda bread recipe because the one I have been making the past few years called for wheat flour which I was out of. I went to search out my favorite reliable source. I tried this recipe based on all the great reviews and I had all the ingredients on hand. I am still wondering what I could of possibly of done wrong. The bread I normally make blows this one away. I found the bread to be almost tough and could of been a little sweeter. Both my Husband and I agreed. I did notice how many people commented on how it was good & even better toasted the next day. That makes me wonder how good the recipe really was to them...hmmmm. Anyway I took the second loaf and sliced it real thin, brushed it with butter, sprinkled sugar and baked it in the oven. This landed up being great. I will definately stick to my old recipe next time.

First, I have to commend your site, great work! This is just another fabulous recipe that I have utilized from your site. Quick, easy, and delicious. I have tried it with all wheat flour and substituted the raisins for dried cherries, apricots, and/or chopped dates, yummy!

This was a great treat! Very easy to make. It was the lightest soda bread ever. I used King Aurthur's All Purpose Flour as my grocery did not have bread flour. The crust was chewy and the center was tender. Perfect. The combo of raisin and caraway seed was delish. Makes yummy toast the next day!

After years of the same ol' soda bread for Saint Paddy's day, I made this one instead. I added the brown and white sugars as suggested by others, but didn't have caraway seeds, so did without. The bread was good, better than my usual recipe and my guests liked it. But... having leftover corned beef and cabbage still leftover last night, I thought I'd make the bread again. This time I mixed it using my Mixmaster with the paddle attachment until it was JUST combined, then dumped the sticky mess onto a lightly floured surface and brought it into two rough rounds, handling as little as possible, as I'd seen suggested in a diffent recipe. The results were divine! A much less tough crust and much softer dense cake-like body than the usual hard and almost chewy density of other soda breads I've both made and had in Irish restaurants.

Thought it was good but it needed sugar. When sugar was added it improved taste. I would certainly make again.

For those of you who have never made Irish soda bread, or can't remember the last time you did, expect this dough to be very gloppy and stick to your hands like glue in the kneading process. I used a heavily floured board and hands (as directed), added lots more flour, but nothing helped. I had to pour the dough into an 8" cake tin to contain it, and the dough was so soft that the cross on the top wouldn't "take." With all that, the bread was very tasty. I added the white and brown sugars suggested by other reviewers; however, if I again serve it with corned beef and cabbage, I'd add a little less sugar. I nearly had a potential disaster. Normally a careful cook, I forgot to add the baking powder(!), but pulled the pan out of the oven after a few minutes and stirred it in quickly, and back into the oven. Didn't hurt a thing!

A delicious soda bread. This was my first time making soda bread and it was a hit. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used 1/2 a cup of raisins, 1/2 a cup of dried cranberries and I think that was the "crowning touch." Nice crispy crust, soft interior.

I was very surprised how good this bread came out since most soda breads are pretty bland. This one was delicious. I used half raisins, half dried cranberries, and like a previous reviewer, I added 3 tbsp. of white sugar and 3 tbsp. of brown sugar.

This was a fantastic addition to our St. Patrick's Day celebration. After reading other soda bread recipes and these reviews, I added about three TBS each of regular and brown sugars. It was a subtle sweetness-- just the perfect amount.

This was loved by all at our table!

Definitely a keeper recipe. Easily halved for just one loaf. After the first time, I modified to add a couple tablespoons sugar (for better toasting) and used the full amount of raisins and caraway in the half recipe. I will certainly try the suggested substitution of cranberries...and, speaking of substitutions--you can easily substitute a cup of regular milk with 2 teaspoons (a coupld of caps-ful) of vinegar mixed in for the buttermilk.
