The recipe in the book calls for 1/4 lb chix thigh or breast thinly sliced. Otherwise its the same. We like the chicken version, but usually cut down on the amount noodles and add some crushed red pepper on top.

Bland. There wasn't enough sauce for a whole pound of noodles when made according to the recipe. Not fun at all, and definitely not fun shrimp - 1/4 lb of shrimp isn't much at all. There are far better rice noodle/shrimp recipes out there.

I haven't made this recipe. Thought it looked good, but I also found it odd that a reference to 'chicken' was inadvertently included. I agree...it doesn't instill much confidence.

Modified this recipe by omitting bean sprouts and peanuts, and doubling the amount of shrimp. I also added sauteed mushrooms. Absolutely delicious - our guests loved it. I will definitely make this one again!

I was confused by the reference to "chicken" in paragraph 5, but I guess it is a typo for shrimp. Still, it doesn't exactly instill confidence.

I never knew shrimp was this fun!

This is an easy to prepare, kid friendly recipe. I substituted dark sesame oil for the vegetable oil, and wakame seaweed for the bean sprouts, but it still turned out very well.
