I tried a couple of crab cake recipes over thanksgiving. I ended up using this recipe but added a 1/4 cup capers and a 1/4 cup diced red pepper and a tablespoon of corse mustard instead of the dry mustard. Adding the ingredients gave the recipe the flavor and color that the original was missing.

Delicious crab cake recipe. Fresh bread crumbs from good bread are the key to any good crab cakes.

When you try a new crab cake or homemade sausage recipe, always break off a quarter sized piece and cook it for sampling. Then you can adjust your seasonings as necessary.

This was soooooo good! Made this dish for New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it. I made fresh white buttermilk sandwich bread for bread crumbs in the food processor and assembled the crab cakes the night before. They fried up perfectly warm and tasty.

NOT THE BEST CRAB CAKES I´VE MADE OR TASTED, I NEEDED MORE CEYENNE FLAVOUR THAN A "GENEROUS PINCH" AND I ALSO THINK THEY WOULD BE NICER IF BOILED POTATO WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE BREAD CRUMBS.

My husband loves crab cakes and this is the best recipe I've found. He raves every time.

These were a bit too bland for me - I should have followed the reviewers and decreased the bread crumbs and upped the cayenne and added something for some zip or color. So far Martha's recipe is winning for me!

Not that great. When I go to the expense and trouble of making crab cakes I want to tast crab, not bread crumbs. To anyone reading these reviews to decide whether or not to make, I say keep looking for a better recipe. My favorite is in the Colorado Junior League Recipe Book title Cape Fear Crab Cakes with Lemon Aoli Sauce. (Spicy with a hint if tartness) If anyone wants the recipe, please email me and I am happy to send.

My husband and I have made this recipe several times...It's great! We always serve a caper/mayo-based sauce with it to add extra flavor & I've even used prepared breadcrumbs to save time. We've even been somewhat disappointed with crabcakes in nice seafood restaurants after making these at home. A great recipe! Give it a try!

I agree...great recipe but it calls for too many bread crumbs!! The first time they were a bit mealy, but the second time I reduced the amount of bread crumbs and increased the amount of cayenne...very easy and quick...

I've made it twice. Just get the best crabmeat you can. Second time wasn't as good because I couldn't find the better crabmeat. As the recipe suggests the simple ingredients allow the flavor to come through. Great for entertaining, made 12 crab cakes for 6 people out of recipe and added about 1/4 cup of minced red pepper and 1/4 cup of corn kernels to add color. Served with a mesclun salad with simple vinagrette on the same plate and only spent 5 minutes away from my guests.

I have made this several times because I think the flavor is so great! I do have trouble getting the cakes to stay together, though, so I would not make it for company -- they sometimes don't look as good as they taste.

I found this receipte great, I only used a pinch of cayenne and I couldn't notice it at all; which is okay for me and my husband, becasue we don't like too much spice. I only put in about 1 3/4 cups of breadcrumbs into the recipe and it held together great, they cooked up quick and we enjoyed they alot. I would definately make them again. I serve them with a lemon dill sauce, which only added to the flavour.

I have tried various recipes on Crab Cakes. I found this one to be great. I used a whole loaf of french bread to make it stick together great. My family loves spicey foods so I used a rather large amount of cayenne pepper. My family loved it so I will make it again for sure.

Not bad. But imitation crab!!@$!@#????? What's the point, then?

Simple and delicious. You should definitely add more cayenne if you like them spicy.

I thought these were good even though they were a little plain. I used a generous pinch of cayenne but it wasn't enough to notice. I'd recommend trying more. I probably wouldn't make them again. I'd look for a recipe I like better.

These were good, even though I substituted imitation crab. The recipe took more bread crumbs than indicated. Nice for a change.
