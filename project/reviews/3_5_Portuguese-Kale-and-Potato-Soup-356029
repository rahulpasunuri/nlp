Amazing! The only changes I made to the recipe were 1. I used chicken stock instead of water and 2. I added cut up carrots and celery. Make sure you use high quality sausage. I will be making this again and again.

I made this almost exactly as written, but exchanged 4 cups beef stock for 4 of the cups water. I used lacinato kale (the flat-leaf variety) as suggested. Buy the best sausage you can find and make sure it gets nice and crispy. Great the next day, too. So easy, apart from the somewhat time-consuming task of processing the kale (do it while the soup's simmering). This recipe's a definite keeper!!

A nice rustic dinner with homemade crusty bread. Subbed 4c. of chx broth plus 2 cups of water. Added nice flavor. Remember to chop the kale up finer next time.

The key to this recipe is the sausage. I used Aidell's brand chicken chorizo and I am not sure how it compares to traditional Portugese ingredients but the result was hearty, delicious, and easy to make.

My sweetie and I just enjoyed this delightful soup. I did substitute chicken broth for the water. I used a spicy linguiça which was wonderful. I made the soup in the early afternoon and let the flavors blend, while lightly simmering, adding the kale just 5 minutes before serving. Wow, this is easy to make and taste fantastic. Enjoy with a terrific bread to mop up all the last drops in your bowl.

Having had the delicious Caldo Verde in Mozambique & Angola, I must agree with NEAuthentics. It's a lovely simple soup as is. It doesn't need garlic or other spices. I made it to the original recipe only changing the broth for water (which I do in most recipes). Gets better by the hour as the potato breaks up.

Awesome easy soup! Managed to get my picky fiance to consume more greens using this soup despite his usual complaints about kale. I substituted mixture of chicken broth and water...a dash of Knorr's chicken bullion powder (less than a teaspoon for all 6 cups of liquid) when using only water. Used 1 Aidells brand cajun style andouille sausage from TraderJoe's for the entire soup. Enough flavor in that 1 sausage to give soup a good smokiness without too much fat.

Delicious and easy soup. Be sure to use chicken broth instead of water, and add salt to taste. Red pepper flakes give it a nice flavor, too. A great cold weather soup!

This soup is fantastic. I made a few modifications: I added a little smoked paprika when browning the onions and I used chicken stock instead of water. As for the vegetables I used swiss chard instead of kale because that's what I had handy and I used sweet potatoes instead of white ones. I also added a 14 oz. can of chickpeas. I have already made this recipe a few times and it is a winner.

This is a traditional version of caldo verde: 6 c. water/ 5 medium Maine or Yukon Gold, or other starchy potatoes, peeled and quartered (approx. 5 c.)/ 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped/ 1 tbsp. coarse salt/ 1 bunch of flat-leaf kale (1 1/2 lbs. before trimming)/ 5 tbsp. olive oil/ 1/4 lb chourico or linguica, sliced very thin/ Water, potato, onion in a pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, season w/ salt, simmer until potatoes are very tender, 20-30 min. Trim kale of the stem, rinse. Drain. Roll and chiffonade. When potatoes are cooked, puree in pot until a smooth consistency. Return to boil. Add greens and olive oil. Simmer until bright green and tender, but not mushy. Brown sausage slices in a skillet. Serve soup with chourico/linguica slices on top.

As a person of Portuguese heritage, I find it important to stick to tradition with this recipe. Other wise, you can't call it a caldo verde. First, do yourself a favor and DO NOT use kielbasa. Huge mistake. Definitely never had it with garlic either, but I'd imagine that isn't a huge problem. Also, you should use the flat leaf kale so you can roll it up easily and get a good, THIN chiffonade cut. And traditionally it is served with a fried slice of chourico or linguica on top. However, I like putting more chourico in my soup, because chourico is obviously delicious. Overall though, it's pretty accurate.

This was a fairly 'rustic' soup; simple, chunky and hearty. I used some stock for the water, and had red kale so used that (it turned green and turned the soup purple). Best served with some crusty bread.

I pretty much followed the recipe, only adding smoked paprika and red chili flakes and I used chicken broth instead of water. Great soup for a cold night and I will definitely make it again.

Like several others, I "chickened out" and used low-sodium chicken stock instead of water; just couldn't imagine it being good with just water, sausage and kale. I also cut out the salt called for in the recipe. It was delicious. My husband and I both loved it, and it made great leftovers. I think the quality of the sausage is key here -- I used chorizo sausages that my husband made with an Italian friend who has the proper equipment. I wouldn't recommend trying this with grocery-store sausage; splurge on sausage from a specialty shop that has no preservatives or fillers.

I made this soup for my Portuguese hubby and the family and they loved it. I made a bit more soup: 10 cups of water, more of everything else, and I added 3 Knorr chicken boullion cubes. Delicious!

I didn't see an option to edit ratings/reviews so please forgive my second entry (unless this replaces my original post, in which case, eh). In my original 2-fork review, I mentioned that the soup was one-note and needed some assistance. I added some red wine vinegar to mine for added flavour, which raised it to an 'OK'. Well, I had the leftovers the next day and it tasted like nasty, fibrous sausage water. I can't erase the taste from my memory. Never again!

Rating: 1
Pretty decent soup for the amount of time needed to prepare it. I added a bay leaf when sauteeing the onions. Still, I found it rather "one-note" and added about 3 tbsp red wine vinegar after the initial tasting. That gave the soup some much-needed dimension. I imagine a few squeezes of fresh lemon + zest would've been even better.

Sorry, but I did not care for this at all. I adjusted according to the reviews, but it was just ordinary. Would never make this soup again.

Portuguese cuisine requires a knack for cooking 'by the eye', as any good Portuguese cook will tell you. So with what seems like a relatively easy recipe like 'caldo verde' (Green Kale Soup) you need to understand that different potatoes have different starch contents at different times of the year so you would never get a good Kale Soup made with new potatoes, kale tastes best in cold weather, and the best sausage makes the best soup. I've never heard of Portuguese people using meat broth for this soup but then again, Portuguese cooks are creative and resourceful so different regions may put their individual touch on a national dish, changing it ever so slightly, according to local availability of ingredients and taste preferences. I would not add paprika to this soup but get the paprika taste from a good paprika-based sausage (chouriço de colorau). My suggestion is that you visit Portugal in the winter and try many Caldo Verdes and sausages and then experiment at home till you get it just right!

This is normally not my type of soup, but I thought I would take a chance and am glad that I did. I did make a couple of substitutions; I could not get Portuguese sausage, so I used 1/2 Sopressetta and 1/2 Chorizo. I also used chicken broth instead of water and I think it turned out really rich and filling.

I didn't prepare this specific recipe since I'm familiar with a recipe from my from-Portugal relatives, namely a favorite aunt who taught me to do this soup a little differently, which I would recommend, too. First, she would never use water, but a good beef stock and would also add the following ingredients, with no special prep needed: 1) kidney beans, 2) a little cabbage, 3) a little pork shoulder if you have some handy, but not necessary, 4) paprika, a must 5) elbow or similar sized pasta thrown in ten minutes before turning off heat.

This soup was great. I added 2 tsp paprika per previous reviewers' suggestions, but may try only 1 tsp paprika next time. I also added 3-4 bouillon cubes and some red pepper flakes. The next day, I added some canned Great White Northern beans to the leftovers and it made the soup heartier and more interesting. Accompanied with sour cream, Cholula smoked Chipotle sauce, and some cooked rice. Hubby said I can make this every day!

I used linguica, cooked the kale for about 15 minutes, rather than 5, and used a combination of vegetable broth (4 cups), water (2 cups) and chicken broth (2 cups). I also added cannelini beans at the end, and dressed the servings with chili pepper infused olive oil. Very nice recipe; would make again.

Yummy and satisfying on a cold winter evening! Super easy... I didn't remove the sausage after browning... just threw the onions and garlic in after about 5 minutes, cooked another 5, then added the potatoes and water. Also, that's a little too much olive oil.. just use enough to brown the meat. Top it off with hot sauce!

Really excellent with a few changes: 1.5 lbs potatoes (cooked for 30 min instead of 20). Added 2 tsp paprika and some red pepper flakes. Used 4 c chicken stock and 2 c water. Simmered kale for 10 minutes. Really tasty and hearty!

Made this last night using chicken stock instead of water. Following another reviewer's lead, I sauted the sausage with the onions and garlic, adding a bit of smoked paprika. Local kale and potatoes from the farmer's market. We tried it with hot sauce and without and it was tasty both ways. Definitely worth repeating.

Delicious. I used chorizo and chicken broth (rather than water). Finished with a squeeze of lemon. Even better the next day.

Personally, I'd have given this recipe 4 forks, but husband wasn't keen on it. I used it as main dish, so doubled the sausage. Also, as I'm not fond of the Chourico we get, I used hot smoked sausage. And I used chicken broth instead of water. If I make it again I may use regular smoked sausage and add a potato. But I thought it was a lovely satisfying main dish soup. And all that kale has to be healthy (I used pound of pre-chopped, and chopped some more, so may have gotten more than if I used actual bunches of kale.) I do get annoyed when people don't follow the recipe and then write about it, but I think my effort was close enough to judge, and it was adjusted to our personal tastes, which is not a bad thing to do.

YUM!! Used white wine and vege stock, an extra potato, threw in some Aleppo pepper and used morning star farms breakfast patties. Fantastic vegetarian version of this soup.

This "caldo verde" pales in comparison to those of the ethnic Portuguese who live in my town and to my own, developed from local recipes. It is rather bland. Use more chourizo, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, chicken and/or beef stock instead of water, and a touch of heat. The Portuguese pride themselves on their caldo verde--no two are the same. So experiment, just don't limit your esperience to this recipe.

It doesn't get any better than this. As long as you have all ingredients, this is one quick, tasty and hearty meal. Add some nice crusty bread and you're good to go on a cold evening. Like other reader/cooks I like to use veg. or chicken stock instead of water, but water is fine in a pinch. In our house we also like to add dry chili pepper flakes to our individual bowls to spice to our liking, otherwise it's perfect as is!

What a fantastic soup for a dreary day. I forgot to pick up some sausage while grabbing the kale and potatoes, so I cut up a few slices of bacon and browned it first. The only other change I made was adding two cups of vegetable stock in place of two of the cups of water. Easy to make and very hearty meal. Don't forget a little hot sauce once you ladle it into the bowl. Suprisingly, Sriracha went very well with this dish. Little goes a long way, though!

One thing this recipe leaves out is smoked paprika, which makes this soup so much better. Add about 2 teaspoons to the onion/garlic saute. You can also substitute russet potatoes for sweet potatoes, or both. Also I find it better to let the soup simmer for about 30-40 minutes to fully develop the flavor.

Kale is so good for you.It does a lot of things for you.I used 3/4 of low fat chicken stock for the liquid and added a couple turnips.I mashed 1 of the turnips and about half of the potato's and put back into the soup.Had the best of both worlds with creamy soup and chunks of potato.There is a European deli a couple miles from me they had Linguica.Tasty stuff and simple

This recipe is too basic. Caldo Verde usually has chicken stock and some herbs.Emeril Lagasse has a recipe that uses fresh mint as a finishing touch and it is surprisingly delicious. To the cook from Sonoma while your additions may be tasty, it can't taste anything like Caldo Verde.

I tried this recipe with a few changes last night. My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I used Italian sausage, and yukon gold potatoes because that's what I had on hand. I also used three cups of beef broth with three cups of water. the kale I bought had no stems and very small ribbing, so prep was easy. I'll definitely make this again.

made it tonight for dinner, very quick to be honest. I set the kale aside and chopped it up while the simmer was on. Used linguica and probably didn't add enough tater, but the kale came out with a nearly buttery flavor, and the soup was delicious.

For a much deeper and fuller flavor sear onion and chourcio together in fry pan. Then transfer into a deep pot. Add to the same pot cut russets and then fill 3/4 of the way with chicken stock. In the same searing pan, add Kale. Toss and Par sear then add 1 cup of water. Transfer Kale to deep pot and bring everything to a boil. Lower to a rolling boil for 15 minute or until potato is soft. Serve over a piece of portuguese sweet bread. Fantastic!

Fairly traditional recipe - although the soup comes out MUCH better if you separate the potatoes after they're done cooking (so don't cut them too small) and blend them so that it becomes a cream and add it back into the soup. Caldo Verde is supposed to be a very creamy soup, w/ the texture coming from the blended potatoes.

Rating: 3
I had to simmer longer than 20 minutes to get the potatos soft, so like another reviewer, it did take awhile to get everything prepped especially the kale so would not put this in the "quick" category. Soup came out great though and I would make again. Very hearty and the kale add nice texture and flavor to the soup. I would add more potato or cut down on some of the water as was still on the thin side in my opinion.

We thought this was 2 forks - "good" - and we even used locally made kielbasa, farmers' market kale and potatoes, and homemade chicken broth. It was *not* a quick meal - it took a long time to wash and chop the kale and peel the potatoes. It was not stand-out enough to make again.

also, white potatoes will hold shape better and are tastier than russet. And beef broth works better than water. Thanks for the poster who recommended the linguica and corn bread:)

This is a great recipe and real simple. It truly took 15 minutes of my time to prepare. I highly recommend finding linguica because it brings a great flavor to the soup. I did add a dash or two of red pepper flakes to heat it up a little more. It would be great with corn bread. Try linguica cooked whole on the grill and sliced thinly on a diagonal Add the linguica to the top of a burger with carmalized onions, a slice of provolone cheese melted over the top and a spicy mayo.

I made this for dinner tonight and my guests all loved it-even my 10 year old son. I made everything exactly as directed-but for the sausage I used both the turkey kielbasa and sweet italian sausage I had in the freezer-the combination worked great. This was pretty fast and easy-but removing the ribs of the kale and slicing it did take awhile. I'd say a quick meal if you had already done the prep work...
