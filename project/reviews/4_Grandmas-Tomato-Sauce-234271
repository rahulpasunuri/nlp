I have loads of homegrown tomatoes, but I do not have a food mill. Will this recipe still work without one?

I can't say enough about this recipe. It is my favorite tomato sauce, ever. I just made it from 30 pounds of this season's tomatoes because I want it all winter long! I run half the recipe through a food mill after 4 hours or so of simmering. Then I run the remaining half through a food processor to give it some texture. If I feel like reducing it a little more after this, I do. I never added sugar, our tomatoes were already sweet. If I were to make this sauce in the winter with out of season tomatoes, I might roast the tomatoes first to bring out the flavor.

I made this sauce last year to keep in the freezer and making it again this year. The sauce keeps well for up to 6 months when deep frozen. It's simple with good flavor. Plus it's easy to zest up depending on your mood. I bumped up the garlic a little bit (I use one big head). Also I get like 4 pints per 10 lbs of tomatoes instead of 6 or 7.

Fabulous sauce--rich, smooth, ultra-flavorful. I cut tomatoes without seeding them, then used a food mill at the end which worked perfectly at separating the skin and seeds from the rest of the sauce. I also cut the sugar and salt by 1/3 (my tomatoes were homegrown and already sweet) and would do so again. Yum!
