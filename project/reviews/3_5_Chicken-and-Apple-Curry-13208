I generally don't review recipes that i made major changes on unless it's to give it 4 stars, this is one of those. Big substitution, Gala apples instead of GS, 2 lemons worth of juice to counter the sweetness. yellow instead of red pepper. It came out mush except for the chicken but the flavor was great, gonna definitely try it again as written.

Adding cayenne and using cider for half the broth brings it home.

Thanks to the reviewer who recommended some heat. I chopped in a jalapeno which was just right. The vegetable cooking times struck me as way too long, so I cooked everything about half as long as directed and the textures were perfect. I also halved the chicken stock so the consistency was nice and creamy. I also added some garam masala at the very end and then served it over coconut rice. Crazy delicious.

This was good - tried adding the coconut milk and fish sauce and that helped the flavor. Sauce was too liquidy and my family would have liked more vegetables, so I think I will try that next time. But good overall - just needs some TLC.

Tasty but needed cayenne pepper or some other source of heat

This is the dish I cook most regularly, the family loves it, and it's impossible to mess up.

I enjoyed the interesting combination of the spicy curry with the sweetness of the apples. I think next time I will perhaps add a little brown sugar, as well as more cumin and cinnamon to enhance the sweet and spicy aspects of the dish.

I made this for my family and they liked it much more than I did. The flavor was fine, although it wasn't very spicy, which is what I usually like about curry. I used a little extra flour to thicken it up and then I served it over rice.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night and it was fabulous! I had never made a curry before, so i was pleased that this one turned out so well. I will definitely add this one to my box!

This recipe was relatively simple to make and tasted great. I added some coconut milk like some other reviewers did. The chutney was awesome. Next time, I'm going to use boneless skinless chicken thighs.

The apple-ginger chutney is a must with this recipe as otherwise the sauce is quite bland. I even added some lemon juice and wine but it didn't help much. However, the chutney was delicious and gave the dish that perfect kick.

This was......strange. I wanted to like it, but the flavors didn't go together quite as I expected. Also, the indicated cooking times made the apples turn to complete mush....I would have preferred more texture. Perhaps with a few additions to spice it up, and shortened cooking time it would be better.

I loved this. Very easy, which is always a plus with me, as I love to eat great food, but usually would rather have someone else prepare it for me! I added extra curry, more chicken broth, and chopped the apple very coarsely for more texture. Also threw in a handful of salted peanuts for crunch before serving. Maybe another type nut would be more appropriate? Suggestions welcome!

Have made this twice, once as the recipe was written except used boneless chicken breast, and then with some additions the second time to spice it up. The additions were additional curry powder, coconut milk, Thai fish sauce, and hot pepper flakes. I served it both times rolled up in crepes. It is a great brunch dish and very much appreciated by my guests for its elegance and taste.

I add some carrots and potatoes. Also a bit bland so I put a bit of chili pepper to spice it up.

Great recipe... I modified it by using boneless skinless chicken breasts, added a potato, sliced carrots, and peas , served it over white rice and it was a good weeknight meal. Will definitely make it again!

This was a delicious recipe. I made a couple changes. I baked the chicken in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes instead of browning it. I then removed the skin. Also I added mushrooms. This has become a family favorite.

I made this recipe using chicken breasts and serving it on a mixed fruit flavored pasta. It was just delicious and different. I would make it again for company.
