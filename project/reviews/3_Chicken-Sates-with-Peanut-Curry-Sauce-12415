We loved this recipe. The marinade transformed frozen chicken tenders from Trader Joe's into delectable treats with an unbelievable coconut flavor. Will make this one again.

I used the marinade for chicken wings instead. It was very good but it needs a little tweaking. After reading the comments about the blandness of the dipping sauce I added some garlic/chili sauce and peanut butter, it was a good but also needs some improvement.

I have made this dish many times for potluck barbeques, and everyone always loves it. The dipping sauce can be a bit bland so I add more lime and I've added ginger before, as well, with good results. I highly recommend this dish for an easy backyard crowd pleaser.

I am a vegetarian and made this for a party as an appetizer. I must confess that I did not taste any myself, but it all smelled delicious. Everyone loved it and ate so many that they were full for the main course. So, I am very happy with the recipe.

I cannot believe I actually went to the market for some of these ingredients - what a complete waste. The peanut sauce was bland and the marinade was boring. Certainly cannot compare with even the worse asian places I've eaten at. Don't waste your time!

The peanut curry sauce was great, I'd suggest using unsalted peanuts so you have more control over the amount of salt in the dish. Also, might use less curry depending on the strength of the curry mix. Mine was a bit overpowering.

Chicken was good, but the dipping sauce was very bland.

The chicken was delicious & simple to make. No problems with it getting dry. Just 3 minutes per side in the toaster oven. I think the sauce needs a little more zing, but I haven't decided what I want added to it yet. Perhaps some more lime.

The peanut sauce for this is really delicious. Be careful not to cook the chicken for too long and dry it out.

This is a pretty good recipe. I left the chicken breasts whole and grilled them in the oven. I used curry paste instead. I like it spicy and I didn't seem to add enough, didn't have the punch that I was hoping it would have. I served it with Jasmine rice.
