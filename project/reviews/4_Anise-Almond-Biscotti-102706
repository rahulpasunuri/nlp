Such an easy recipe and turns out great every time. Ive tweaked the recipe several times. My recent changes included using less sugar (1.25 cups sugar), added 1 cup almond flour (to replace 1 cup wheat flour) - added toasted pistachios, chocolate chips and WOW! An amazing biscotti.

Rating: 4
This is a go-to recipe for me. I have made it a number of times and I still love it. I always use 1.5x or 2x the anise in the recipe for a bolder flavor. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a fairly simple biscotti recipe.

This is, hands down, the best biscotti I have ever eaten. I did not have almonds on hand. I used 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. I also used 3/4 teaspoon whole anise and 1/2 teaspoon of ground anise because I don't like the anise flavor to overwhelm. I felt this was the proper recipe to use my good Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla...that was a spot on choice. DO wet your hands before shaping the loaves, it makes all the difference in the world. I did slice them a little before 25 minutes and did not have an issue with crumbling as mentioned in other feedback. They went perfect with my morning cappuccino. If you can melt butter, mix ingredients, bake and slice then bake again...you can make this recipe. Bravo!

I'm on a quest for the perfect biscotti recipe. I tried this recipe twice - following it precisely on round #1, tweaking it a bit on round #2. While I can't say it's time to end the quest, this recipe did come close, especially after a few tiny tweaks. Here are a few things that helped in my experiments and will go into my permanent biscotti quest file: On the 2nd round, I throttled back the baking powder a bit to 2 3/4, rather than 3, TBSP. While I appreciate the leavening power of baking powder, I really dislike its alkaline taste. This little tweak made a very nice difference! Like others, I thought they could use a bit more flavor, so I used a full TBSP of freshly ground anise seeds, plus one teaspoon of pure anise extract. While the originals weren't bad, my testers and I all preferred the stronger taste in the 2nd round. I added an egg white to the 3 eggs used in the dough (and I still used the other, designated egg white for the eggwash.) This made the dough more manageable and I think it made the biscotti a bit easier to cut and flip. I baked the 2nd batch 3 minutes longer. Thanks so much for a great recipe! I know I'll reference this as the classic biscotti basis for all sorts of fun variations down the road. I also found that they wanted to crumble as I was cutting them. They do harden up a bit as they cool, so letting them cool and using a sharp serrated knife worked best for me.

I made this recipe three times already. Love it. I didn't have anise so I used poppy seed on one batch. Great. I used anise extract on another batch. Great. I put Chocolate chips on another. Great. Great reading reviews.. Mine did crumble. I will use electric knife next time. I made mine for a St. Joseph Table. Wonderful recipe. Thank you

I had never made biscotti before. I made these last night and they turned out next to perfect. Re other reviewers' comments, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and think I could have reduced it to 1 cup. I used sliced almonds with the skins still on, toasted, with no further chopping, which turned out well. I ground up two teaspoons fresh whole anise seed and think more grinding might have been better, but it also might be that the vanilla extract overpowers the anise. Maybe half a tablespoon of vanilla without increasing the anise? That's what I'll try next. I cut them warm and they did not crumble much at all. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
This has become my Go To biscotti recipe. Tried many other recipes and finally - this one is IT! Perfect balance of flavors as written, but can easily be altered for specific tastes. They did crumble / break easily the first time, but after that I used an electric knife and cut a little bit fatter slices - which seems to work best for me. Other than that - very easy to make. Everyone in the family eats them as a treat, but I think they are perfect for dipping in tea or coffee.

These have become my go-to biscotti recipe (and I bake dozens and dozens of biscotti in any given month). It is very adaptable -- I have halved the recipe when I didn't want as many; I have also added chocolate chips, raisins and cranberries to this recipe for a variation. Since I like smaller biscotti, instead of dividing into two, I divide into 4. I check the loaves a little sooner than recipe to make sure I don't overcook.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! I did not change the proportions at all, they look pretty and are super crunchy! I added 3/4 cups toffee chips and omitted the anise (since I did not have any). I also skipped the egg-white wash, used my wet hands to mold the logs instead (worked great). I am dreaming of trying new flavors, such as different flavorings (almond or rum extract, orange peel, crystallized ginger, dried cherries and different nuts - this recipe has infinite possibilities!). Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

Awesome recipe, lately have been making it on a weekly basis, I also reduced the sugar by ½ cup and made 4 logs instead of 2. when cut makes it the perfect size and more off it !!!!! less crumbly too.

Rating: 3
These were really good! Could use a bit more anise.. I cut sugar a 1/4 cup as well. Had lots of crumbling issues when cutting- I did as others suggested, cut when still slightly warm, but still logs still crumble. I can't use these as gifts...they just dont look good enough.

Rating: 4
"dougiedd" asked whether they crumbled less if sliced sooner. Yes, I made a note about that on my well-used printed copy of this recipe after the first time! They definitely slice easier when still a little warm. My only other notation is that the logs can be shaped with wet hands instead of floured hands. These are absolutely perfect biscotti and I've made them to rave reviews many times. The texture and flavor are excellent for dipping in coffee or tea. I grind the aniseed fresh in a spice grinder and I think it's the right amount of anise flavor -- sweet, subtle and nice.

Rating: 4
I thought these were great, but I doubled the anise and still couldn't taste it in the final product. Next time I will triple the anise and/or add anise extract. I took previous reviewers' advice and used only 1C sugar. As promised, still plenty sweet. I used whole wheat flour. Don't despair if they don't start out crisp. These get more crisp after they have been out of the oven for a few hours.

When I made this recipe for a dinner we had, I thought people were going to attack me for more. I know it made 3 dozen cookies, but with 10 people, there were only 5 left! And that was with ice cream... Like it says in other reviews, it would be better with about 2 to 3 more teaspoons of anise seed. You can even put them through your coffee grinder on fine if you do not have already ground. Also this time around, I dipped them in melted chocolate chips and cooled them with some crushed almonds on the top. They were even better! Enjoy

This is my first ever biscotti making experience and I think I picked a winner! After reading the reviews I upped the ground anise to 3 teaspoons. I used my coffee grinder to grind the anise really fine. Also, I did not have almonds so I substituted toasted hazelnuts. Delicious results!

These were good but the anise taste was almost imperceptible, and that is the whole point ... thus the 2 stars only. But I saved the day by making a confec. sugar, milk, anise extract glaze and covering them in that. I would make again adding anise extract to the dough.

wonderful simple biscotti: concur on cutting down sugar by 1/4 cup used fennel ground up instead of anise as that was what was on hand; only problem: some crumbling if completely cooled: can anyone confirm: is there less crumbling if cut with serrated knife after shorter cooling?

These are great biscotti. Subtle flavors and great texture. I didn't have anise seed so I used fennel seed and doubled up on the almonds which still wasn't quite enough for even distribution. If you use only 1 cup some biscotti won't have any almonds visible.

awesome basic recipe. i, too, did not let them cool long enough before the second baking and it does change the texture. i have made this several times. reduced sugar to 1 cup and they are still plenty sweet. also, added extra anise to taste. i have also made them without the anise, and added instead orange zest and grand marnier. added dried cranberries once too...fun to experiment and the recipe adapts well.

they always turn on fabulously. make sure you follow directions with cooling, i was in a hurry and did not cool the biscotti enough before cutting and after and its a different texture. same great taste, just a different less crunchy texture.

I have made many other more "cookie- like" biscotti recipes, but I feel like this is the first "legit" biscotti I've ever baked. I don't consider myself a big fan of anise, but I had extra anise seed on hand, so I decided to go for it. The flavors are so subtle and delicious. Plus, this is the densest, finest biscotti I have ever made. The end result is a lovely, fragrant golden biscuit that (dare I say) is reminiscent of Enrico's in Pittsburgh's Strip District! Yum!!

Fantastic taste and texture. Good dough to work with. Didn't crumble when sliced. I used 1 cup of sugar and I think they are perfect. Probably the must buttery biscotti I have made so far. And my first time to use aniseed. What a comforting and complex aroma filled the house - perfect for a winter day. Second baking was at 300 for a little longer than suggested. But that is just my preference and my oven. I use a Maytag gas range with double oven and I used the smaller top oven for the biscotti.

This is to answer Marc's question, the first time baker.

I have made this recipe several times -- each time, I have received rave reviews! I substitute anise extract for the ground anise and it turns out great.

I am a novice when it comes to baking, this was my first attempt at making biscotti ever. I did run into some challanges while making it, as in how to mix the dough properly as it got really thick and sticky towards the end, and how to mold it into logs with my hands ... all in all it was well worth the panic ... delicious outcome ... didn't have any aniseed, so I replaced it with a tablespoon of orange zest and it came out great. I am wondering if it would be easier to cut the logs before they completely cool off, they were a bit on the brittle side when I started cutting them! Could someone give me an advice on this, please? I think next time I am going to try with pistachios instead of almonds ... Thanks, Marc

Excellent biscotti recipe. Amount of anise is not overpowering, as it sometimes is in store-bought cookies. Brought these to a holiday goodie table, and while not everyone likes biscotti, those who do raved. The only change I made was to drizzle decoratively with melted chocolate and allowed it to dry before boxing up between layers of parchment. An adult treat!

A terrific recipe, and easy to make. My only suggestion is that rather than use a serrated knife to cut the biscotti, use a heavy Asian cleaver. Press down slowly on the biscotti loaf with the cleaver, and the biscotti never breaks into pieces.

I've lost count of the number of times these have been requested. A favorite variation: replace anise with zest of one orange and dip cooled biscotti in bittersweet chocolate (Valhrona or Callebaut). I've also replaced the anise with cardamom and omitted the almonds.

Truly excellent: will make you realize that store-bought biscotti are nothing like the real thing. I usually sub rye flour for some of the white (in all recipes), so here used 2 c rye and 1 1/4 c white. I also subbed almond extract for the vanilla, which I would highly recommend: the biscotti ended up perfectly, lightly perfumed. Not too anise-y, either, but just enough for the anise and almond to play off each other.

These are absolutely perfect classic biscotti, hard and crunchy to hold up to dipping in coffee and with a beautiful appearance and aroma in addition to great flavor. I made these for holiday gifts and several people said they were the best biscotti they'd ever had.

This recipe goes in among my all-time favorites.

I made these biscotti following the recipe with minor substitutions: I did not have aniseed at hand, so I used fennel seeds instead, and i blanched and peeled the almonds before toasting them (which I actually recommend doing). They came out fantastic. They're not too sweet, actually they only have a very subtle sweetness, just a hint of anise flavor, but essential, and the perfect crunch. Traditionally these are eaten in Italy by dipping them first in a dessert wine, called Vin Santo, and I can happily report that they've passed that test excellently. They are also delicious dipped in coffee as a light breakfast snack.

Here's another variation I tried using the same basic recipe: Orange-Macadamia Biscotti. Instead of the vanilla and anise, I substituted 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier and the zest from 2 oranges (I used a microplane zester). Instead of the almonds, I used a cup of coursely chopped macadamia nuts. These biscotti are as outstanding as the original flavor, and better than the other orange biscotti on this site.

Rating: 4
I guess I'll get on the bandwagon with my four forks. The texture and sweetness of these biscotti were perfect, so I wouldn't mess with the proportions of flour, sugar, butter, and eggs. The listed baking times also worked out well for me. I did have to make a few substitutions: I used spelt flour and maple sugar because of allergies in the family, and, since I didn't have the anise on hand and was out of vanilla (who ever runs out of vanilla?), I used a generous tablespoon of Galliano (Pernod might work, too). These biscotti are already staples at our house. It's hard to imagine going back to store-bought.

Yummm. This is a buttery shortbread-like biscotti rather than a dry crunchy one. I'll admit to a few alterations: I used half King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour and half all-purpose. I omitted the anise seed and instead used 1/4 cup Ouzo (a Greek distilled liquor flavored with anise). I also added a half cup of toasted pine nuts.

I bake a lot of biscotti, and these were by far one of my favorites. I have usually made the non-butter biscotti so wasn't sure how these would be, excellent! Also, made the dough ahead into logs and froze so I could bake when I want, these frooze beautifully, and you can prepare them a few weeks before the holiday rush. Lastly, I didn't feel like crushing the seeds and it was no problem, couldn't tell the difference!

Simply the Best! I used only 1 teaspoon liquid aniseed extract instead of ground aniseed, which gave the biscotti a very nice subtle anise flavor without dominating the flavor of the roasted almonds.

Absolutely the best biscotti recipe. Have made it several times now and EVERYONE who has one agrees that these are the best. Agree with previous reviewers: egg wash unnecessary, and yes, watch them closely during the second baking. I suggest not baking as long as writtem for the second baking, otherwise the result will be a very crispy biscotti. In a pinch, I have used untoasted sliced almonds and honestly, it tastes as good as the toasted coarsely chopped almonds. The real treat is dipping half in Scharffen Berger chocolate. Truly easy to make...I will never buy a biscotti again!

Excellent recipe for biscotti. I used whole anise and a bit of anise extract. I passed on the egg wash, this isn't necessary at all in my opinion. I gave as gifts for Christmas and got rave reviews. I agree with the other cooks on the toasting of the almonds, don't skip it...makes all the difference in the world.

Haven't made this yet, can someone enlighten me on if ground Anise is used (and if so, where the heck do you buy it) or are seeds ground,and if so, how do you do that if you don't have a spice grinder? Has anyone ever tried with whole seeds? thanks! UPDATE: I made this recipe. Used whole anise seeds that I smashed/ground the seeds with my food chopper. Loved the cookies, very nice taste. Will use more anise next time and some more almonds. Toasting the almonds is a must, cutting them before hand made it easier to cut the biscotti. I had no problems with crumbling and did not chill dough prior to shaping.

This recipe turned a Cookie Dork, me, into a Baking Princess. My family says,"Better than bought". Easy and Delicious. I didn't have almonds, I used walnuts.

Very nice with a delicate anise flavor. I thought it would be more pronounced with 2 tsp. anise seeds, toasted and freshly ground. I found a great way to shape the logs by putting half of the dough on a second piece of parchment and then forming each log by placing my hands under the paper and forming the rolls into shape. Hands stayed perfectly clean and I could roll them onto the baking sheet.

This was my 1st attempt at Biscotti, and my husband and I were very impressed!!! Based on other's suggestions, I reduced the Sugar to 1 1/4 Cups and the Butter to 8 Tablespoons (1 stick); and used a combination of 1 teaspoon ground Aniseed and 1 teaspoon Anise extract. Also, I divided the dough in half (didn't need to refrigerate) and shaped it directly on the parchment lined pan, which worked perfectly! I then waited a full 30 min. before slicing and had no problems with crumbling. Next time I will try drizzling them with melted Ghirardelli White Chocolate flavored with Anise and Vanilla Extracts!

The PERFECT biscotti! After trying many different recipies posted, I found this one to be THE BEST!! The dough is a little hard to work with, refrigerating a bit before making the 1st logs helps. I have also tries adding chopped pistachio nuts, and dried cranberies (soak in steaming hot water for 10 mins beofre using in recipe) and it was definately a holiday hit.

My husband and I really enjoy going to a nice coffee house and having a biscotti to dunk. I came across this recipe and gave it a whirl, We were both so pleased. Myself with the ease of the recipe and my husband with the results!!! I made no substitutions and had no problem with it crumbling. They also look great sitting in a tall glass jar in my kitchen (they didn't sit long, though)

i was surprised by the amount of butter in this recipe, and i do think it can be cut down quite a bit. the butter makes the dough difficult to manage and leaves it quite wet. however, it lends the biscotti a truly nutty and lovely taste once it has been browned. i replaced the anise seeds with anise extract -a little less than a tablespoon. you want to be careful with the cutting part, as it can be crumbly and break up. i also left the biscotti in the oven a little longer during the second baking. i tend to like my biscotti really crisp.

I think I have to stop rating other recipes that I like a 4, because that would discredit this rating. I LOVE this recipe. It is so adaptable and easy, and out came the most tender, delicate, delectible, incredible cookies. Bake them once for tender, sugar-cookie like quality, bake them twice for a crisp crust but still tender inside. A word of advice though: my dough was very sticky, and I had trouble with it. There was no way I was going to be able to transfer the log to my baking sheet and have it remain intact. So I refrigerated it for 20 minutes, them lightly floured my surface, rolled my dough into a ball, then transferred it to my baking sheet and rolled it into a log. I made 2 versions: one with anise seed, cardamom, toasted almonds and almond extract; the other had dried tart cherries, chocolate chips and vanilla. Both are delicious.

This was my first attempt at baking biscotti. Wow! These are great! I used one teaspoon of anise extract instead of the ground for a faint anise taste. They look like store bought but taste much better! I plan to package some of these for teachers gifts! Yum!

These are absolutely delicious and very easy to make. They are a little on the sweet side so you could reduce the amount of sugar if you like. My daughter brought some to work with her and her boss wanted to know if she could buy some from me! They do freeze well. Next time I would wait a couple of hours before slicing.

Very, Very good. I made these today and have eaten about 12 already :) The whole family just loves them. I tried to cut one log into slices after 15 mins, quite crumbly, (but still good bonus was I GET TO eat the crumbled bits)the other log I cooled over night it sliced with nary a crumble at all :) Someone said these are easy keepers, just how do they know that??? Who can keep them past a day or two???? :)TRY THESE

This recipe is authentic Italian and so wonderful!!! I've made it more times than I can count. I usually add a teaspoon of anise extract. Be sure to let the logs cool before slicing.

I have made countless biscotti recipes and this is by far the best, and they freeze beautifully. These biscotti taste far better than any I could buy at cafes and specialty stores. It has become a favorite for family, friends and for gift giving. I cut the proportion of sugar to 1 1/4 cups, and 3/4 teaspoon of aniseed. Many thanks to Janet for sharing this recipe with the readers of Bon Appetit.

They come out just like the ones you buy in a cafe! Everyone at work loved them. Make sure to let them cool enough--I was a little over-eager and they are fragile when warm.

My first try at biscotti, suprisingly easy and delicious. No one could believe that I made it.

I substituted pistachios for the almonds and added the zest of one lemon...all my Italian friends swore their grandmother had made these biscotti. Very easy to make and practically fool-proof.

My husband's daughter, who loves cappacino and biscotti, came for a visit. I made these for her, they were such a hit that she took all that was left home with her. I also made them for my coffee pals at the university, many of them asked for the recipe. You can't go wrong with this one.

an old trick is to use star anise in a jar of granulated sugar so that the sugar absorbs the oil from the anise and is naturally flavored and can be use for the sugar and no need to use the anise seed. Great authentic taste.

Mama-mia, this is great old-fashioned-take-me-back-to-my-grandmother's kitchen. I remember this recipie (with little variance) tried and true by 3 generations of grandmother's. It easy and wonderful!!!

I have an Italian friend who can be terribly arrogant about the cuisine of her homeland. She said these cookies taste like her mother's.

This recipe is so easy and so tasty.I drizzled anise-flavored glaze over the biscotti for added flavor.

Interesting to find an old family favorite on Epicurious. Of an Italian origin, this is one of the oldest and best recipes. For those who cannot eat nuts, leave out of the nuts and just add anise seed or anise extract...excellent to serve anytime with any beverage from coffe, tea to wine. Enjoy!!

Really delicious and easy to make. I used vanilla bean instead of extract. I cut second baking time to 10 & 6 mins rather than 12 & 8. depends on oven temp. Very authentic Italian flavor and crunchiness. Very attractive and wonderful dipped in red wine. Brava!
