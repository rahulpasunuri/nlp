Excellent dessert. Light & not too sweet. Added mint leaf on top & sprinkled with toasted chopped almonds. Looks so elegant and crowd pleasing.

I followed directions perfectly but my crust would not release from the pan. Don't know what happened but there seemed to be too much of it. It had a good flavor and I did double the amount of orange zest. Everyone loved the filling and oranges but the presentation was awful! Will have to be really brave to try again.

Have not yet made this, but feel compelled to note that this is not a recipe for almond flour like you buy in the store, as previously suggested. That type is made from raw almonds and will not produce the depth of flavor. Stick with the recipe and toasting your own almonds for max flavor payoff.

The flavor of the crust was great but I thought it made a crust that was too thick for the tart. The rest of the tart was delicious and I'd make it again but in a larger tart pan and increase the filling.

If not for the crust, this recipe would only have gotten two forks. Per the other reviewers, I added extra orange zest, but it still didn't quite measure up to expectations. The crust, on the other hand, is very good -- and I'm hard to please on crusts! A couple of tips: what they're describing is essentially making your own almond flour. I just used almond flour instead of almonds, and used a pastry cutter instead of a food processor to mix everything together. Also, since I'm gluten- free, it was very easy to just substitute a rice-flour mix for the regular flour, and add a bit of xanthan gum. I plan to save the crust recipie to use in with other fillings.

I liked this recipe a lot...I just had a couple of issues with it. I doubled the orange zest (to 1 teaspoon) based on other reviews that the custard was "bland." I wouldn't call it "bland"...more "mild." Next time, I will use two full teaspoons of zest for more orange flavor. Secondly, I found the crust too salty. (Which is odd because I generally like a hit of salt in baked goods.) Next time I'll reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Also, the custard thickened very quickly and I had a hard time folding the whipped cream in, but eventually came out with a nice creamy consistency. Finally, I heated the honey slightly to allow for a thinner drizzle over the tart and the plate. Perfect! Overall, a delicious and impressive dessert!

Crust is excellent, definitely worth the effort. Filling is bland. I will use this crust with another filling with better contrast, maybe one with citrus juice or even a citrus curd. Fresh fruit segments were not enough to save the boring flavor.

soooo good. Crust is one of the best i've ever had, you can roast almonds at 375F in the oven until they tan just a little bit. Definitely worth it. The filling is so easy and quick, and delicious! It's good even with no orange slices on top, or try with grapefruit slices. Keeps really well, and doesn't run at all when you slice it.

fantastic! made it exactly according to recipe, and it was delicious! Good even without oranges on top, or, alternatively, try with grapefruit slices. Make sure you have a removable bottom pan
