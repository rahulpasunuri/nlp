Really just o.k. And VERY sweet. I was surprised at how bland the cake was, even after having added more bourbon than the original recipe suggested. Perhaps some lemon or orange zest in the batter, and/or maybe a combination of cinnamon and maybe a dash of cocoa, maybe even a pinch of cayenne in the dark batter will liven it up. Still, I don't think I'll be making this again. Now the chocolate whiskey bundt cake you can find on epicurious - THAT'S fabulous!

This cake is one of my faves. It's rich in a good old-fashioned way and it looks like the picture. You don't need nearly as much glaze as it calls for though.

This cake turned out really well. It ended up looking pretty much like the picture, was moist, and tasted good. I cut the sugar a bit though from 2 to 1.25 cups and it was sweet enough. Also, I only made half the bourbon syrup and that was more than enough to drizzle over the cake and for each person to add to his/her slice. I didn't have a problem with adding the baking soda that some people described. I think if you add a little at a time, it should be fine.

I am Asian and I find that my older family members never like European style cakes. I was surprised that this one was a hit!

I'm writing after I made it the third time. It is very tasty but I think this will be the last time I made it. Altogether there is 4 sticks of butter in it and I think that's a bit MUCH! The last time I filled the middle part, the open area of the budt cake with candied pecans, it really looked glorious that way. The sauce is a bit too much in quantity. I had left overs at all times. Overall GOOD but too heavy....

It's really, really good. You could eat the glaze with a spoon (I know from experience!) I've made it twice and it was a hit with both groups. Serve it with a really top notch vanilla.

I kept having to find more bourbon cause the 1/2 cup kept mysteriously decreasing, lol. . . . I also added 3-4 table spoons of chopped pecans, 1/2 cup of coconut flakes, and more carrots. IT was a success, the nut gave it more plentiful and texture. WOWs them all the time!

This cake is awesome. The bourbon glaze add so much flavor to this cake!

Good - not exceptional - but good. The lighter layer got a little dry, and didn't have a ton of flavor. I may try adding some cinnamon or even some liquer (Peach Schapps? Limoncello?) to give it a little more pop. All of my guests raved about it, though. Served it with whipped cream, not ice cream, for convenience, but will do ice cream next time to use up the glaze better.

Very good. I'm already thinking of making it again and will use a larger pan when making the glaze. I will also set the cake over a pan to re-glaze the cake a second time. The glaze is wonderful. This was absolutely delicious.

I had high expectations for this recipe. The cake came out beautifully and looked just like the picture. But it was pretty tasteless. Neither layer had much flavor, although the nut portion had interesting texture. The sauce was good, but the cake was very disappointing. I wouldn't be bothered with this one again.

I love this cake. I found it very easy!! I will make it again and again.

I would make this recipe again for the glaze alone. The glaze was indescribably delicious! The cake was a little dry, but I think that might've had something to do with the fact that I baked it in one of those beautifully shaped heavy DARK pans, and didn't reduce the oven temp. I had too much batter for the one bundt pan, so I put the extra in a mini turban-style cake pan, which was lighter in color, and it was wonderful. So be careful. The taste of the cake, though, was yummy, and as I said, the glaze -- almost orgasmic!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. It turned out really well. Super moist and yummy. The glaze is really superb with it. The best part is, I made this with other desserts as well and there were about 8 slices of this cake left. I took each individual slice and wrapped it in saran wrap, then placed them all in a freezer bag and froze them. Now, when my husband or I want a slice I just pull it out of the freezer, put it in the microwave with a bit of the glaze for a few seconds and it still tastes absolutely delicious.

I made this twice for parties and everyone loved it - even friends who were afraid of molasses! I liked having extra sauce around to put over ice cream once the cake was gone.

Listen, this is a very tasty cake.... but be careful! When you make the glaze you add a mix of baking soda & water and it says "it will bubble". What a joke! It will erupt like a volcano! And it's boilng hot sugar/water and molassas... what a mess and I'm so lucky that it didn't flow over my are or hands or something. Be warned.

Very good and fairly simple. I HATE baking, but this cake could definitely see an encore performance. Served with a good vanilla ice cream and the warm sauce - delish.

Fantastic flavor beyond compare. People couldn't get enough. Rich and buttery with just the right amount of bourbon kick. The combination of the dense cake and crunchy pecans is great. There's definitely more than enough glaze, though, so don't feel obliged to use it all. Perfect w/ vanilla bean ice cream.

For me is one of the best, I just love it. Thanks.

My husband and I made it to bring to a dinner party and it was a huge HIT!!!!!! I think that only using the sauce to glaze the cake is plenty and by adding the remaining sauce when serving makes the cake a little too sweet and too soggy. Vanilla ice cream on the side is an excellent extra

Very good & moist. I pushed a spatula through the cake, so there was actually more dark than white. Made a of glaze. Next time I'll make half & just use on cake.

Easy and delicious. Beautiful presentation -- certainly nice enough for company. I halved the glaze recipe and still had more than enough. The bourbon flavor came through without overwhelming the other cake flavors.

I thought this was excellent. I made half as much glaze and thought that was more than enough. Great texture and flavor.

This turned out really well. I just followed the instructions and didn't have any problems. Lots of yummy glaze leftover. I'll save it to have over ice cream.

I made a test cake first for my brother; who is very finicky about food. He absolutely loved it. The following weekend I made it for a friend's graduation. Everyone raved about how delicious and moist it was. The top mixture came out perfectly. I'm making it again this weekend for a few friends.

I made this cake for my annual Kentucky Derby party. It came out moist and wonderful - both the pound cake and the pecan/molasses part - and in just the 50 minutes the recipe noted. As others have said, though, you really do need a big pan for the glaze. I lost a bit of glaze when it bubbled over after adding the baking soda. The cake was a huge hit at the party and many have asked for the recipe!

I ended up with a layer of bland off-white cake and a layer of a darker, tastier and nuttier cake. My layers didn't curl around each other as shown in the picture, it was just two layers of different cake. The glaze is good. The cake took over an hour to bake rather than the fifty minutes given in the recipe. Also, by the time the molasses layer was baked, the lighter coloured layer was dry. Overall, a bit of a waste of a whole pound of butter.

This cake was very good. I did not have Bourbon for the sauce, so I used Brandy, one word "sinfull". I took it to the office, and, I could not believe how many new friends I made that day. Pay attention to the instructions on size of sauce pan to prepare sauce, I found out the hard way, it bubbles up big time when I added the baking soda

This is by far the most decadent and delicious cake I have ever had. Wonderfully light and moist. I could not find light molasses at the super so I substituted a grade A amber maple syrup. Brilliant! My partner would never eat my cakes before because he always compared them to his mother's. This cake barely had time to cool before he tore into it! This recipe is time consuming but well worth the effort.

Great cake, but a lot of work. Two things: as much as a bourbon lover as I am, I still think the glaze might be better with only 1/4 cup of bourbon rather than 1/2 cup. Second, listen to the directions and use a 6 quart pan to make the glaze. It quadruples in size during the cooking. I found that out the hard way!

The Glaze didn't work out for me and It made a lot of glaze. Personally, the cake by itself would have been plenty. Also, The recipe says not to swirl the two mixes. I would swirl slightly otherwise you might end up with two different cakes. i had the pound like cake on top and the molasses cake on the bottom. Not that it didn't taste great, but it wasn't as appealing to the eye.

This was wonderful! Not being a fan of rum soaked cakes i thought I woudl give this a hot. It was not as heavy as I thought it was going to be and had a wonderful, rich, robust taste. The bourbon glaze makes it! The people I served it to loved it as well. I will make this again.
