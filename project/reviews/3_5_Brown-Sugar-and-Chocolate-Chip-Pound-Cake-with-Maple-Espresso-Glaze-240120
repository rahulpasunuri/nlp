I didn't make this, but I ate two pieces of it..It was good. I think I'd like it better without the chocolate chips,with toasted pecans, and an extra teaspoon of maple extract in the batter. Also, you can use decaffeinated instant coffee for the glaze...

Fabulous! The entire recipe was well written & very easy. The glaze was out of this world. The chips were evenly distributed throughout the cake and I can't wait to get up tomorrow to have another huge piece with my coffee....

I followed the recipe exactly as shown and found that the cake was a bit dry. The cake was bordering perfection so I decided to to try it again. This time I adjusted the baking time to 50 minutes and it turned out perfectly. D E L I C I O U S!

Delicious and very easy recipe! I made this at the crack of dawn for a trip to the hospital for my niece having a baby. It was a hit with everyone. Very dense and moist, the chocolate chips were a great addition but the star was the Maple Espresso Glaze. WOW! Everyone was blown away. Will make again for a morning coffee cake.

This was an exceptional cake! The texture and moisture level were perfect! I also beat the butter and sugar for a good while -- longer than three minutes -- while I assembled the dry ingredients. I didn't explore the maple/expresso notes of thise recipe. I made a straight chocolate chip cake with a ganache-type drizzled glaze. (Vanilla flavoring only; glaze of half and half, bittersweet chocolate and a little Karo for shine.) Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the cake itself are rock-solid. And you could flavor the basic cake and glaze anyway you want -- orange flavoring, cinnamon, nuts, whatever. To those of you who produced a dry cake: Know thy oven. Baking times are only suggestions. You always need an oven thermometer and a close eye. My oven is fast, so I always set the timer 15-minutes early. You can always leave it in longer but you can't unbake.

Such a delicious pound cake! This was so easy to put together. I had absolutely no problems with dryness or the chips falling to the bottom of the cake. I followed the advice of other reviewers and whipped the butter and sugar until very fluffy, then beat in each egg for a good while. The cake was light and very moist. I omitted the espresso powder from the glaze so my 18-month-old can eat it too. This is a fabulous recipe for company and large groups. Highly recommended!

Made this cake many many times since it was printed. Every time it comes out wonderful. There are lots of reviews about it being too sweet or not sweet enough. I find that with the glaze you can add more to make it sweeter. Or you dont really need the glaze if you like. It is very delicious as is. I use a formed bunt pan in a rose shape. It does take longer in the oven, than stated in the recipe but just insert in toothpick to check..I have had no issues

This cake turned out really well- moist, not too sweet, light. Based on the prior reviews, I was concerned about dryness, so I made one small change, adding a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the batter. I also made sure the butter & sugar was very fluffy and the other ingredients well integrated. My chocolate chips ended up in the top half of the cake. The glaze is delicious and super easy!

Very, very moist and tasty! Everything cooked up fine. Subbed combo white/dark chocolate chips and subbed chocolate extract for maple extract. Overall I found it to be a teeny bit greasy so perhaps next time I'll cut down on the butter a little. Glaze is outstanding! Big hit at home!

Unlike some of the previous reviewers I have no complaints about this cake. The recipe was straight forward and I followed it exactly. I did not find it dry (perhaps that reviewer's oven temperature was off). My chocolate chips were evenly distributed. I thought the texture was just right for a pound cake(was very careful not to overmix). The buttermilk in the cake and the espresso powder in the glaze seemed to cut the sweetness just the right amount for my taste. My family loved this cake and I will be making it again soon.

This cake is TOO SWEET. Maybe it will be better without the glaze, but I won't make it again.

I thought this was a very moist and tasty cake. I loved the different nuances of flavors with the maple and espresso. I only baked my cake for 50 minutes as opposed to the 1 hour recommended in the recipe and it turned our perfectly. Very rarely do I follow the time set in a recipe because it is usually too long and results in a dry product.

I've made this cake twice. The first time it didn't turn out - it didn't rise properly and was kind of leaden and greasy. I think I mis-measured something, because the second time I made it, it came out very nicely and was very easy and straightforward to make. My chips still sunk - I'll follow the advice below to gently fold them in next time. But I'll definitely make this again! LOVED the icing - my husband avoids coffee flavored things but he really loved this. I even used real powdered espresso - it was the best part of the cake - and looked beautiful! Definitely recommend it.

Been dying to make this, and finally found an occasion. Made as prepared, except only prepared pan through spray with flour in it, no additional buttering or flowering. Rose beautifully, chips stayed distrubuted without, and it came right out of the pan when i wanted it to. The cake was dryer than most (i expected after reading these) and so i liberally applied the glaze -- all in all, a big hit!

Very good. Nice enough for company.

I followed this recipe to the letter (without reading the reviews first) for Thanksgiving. I don't understand why so many had a less than perfect result. The chocolate chips did not sink to the bottom nor did the cake sink. It was also perfectly moist. I had at least 4 people ask me for the recipe. It was certainly a crowd pleaser and I would definitely make it again. LOVED the icing!! The only thing I did differently was to use PAM for baking to grease my pan - you know, the one that has a little flour in the spray. that was the only thing I used.

This is a follow-up to my previous post. I think I've cracked the code on how to improve this cake. I make pound cakes all summer long to sell at my local farmers' market, and I used that most excellent and reliable recipe to improve this one. First of all, I added 1/3 cup shortening to cream with the butter. Then I upped the sugar to two cups total, using half brown sugar and half white (suspecting that the brown sugar, though tasty, was contributing to the texture problem). Then I used one additional egg (so 5 total), and once they were all incorporated, I beat the mixture on high for four minutes until very light and fluffy, getting a lot of volume from the eggs to further improve the texture. Then I followed the original recipe from there. It turned out GREAT this time--moister with a much nicer texture and a better flavor from the added sweetness. Problems solved! (Bon Appetit may now add me to their payroll if they wish...tee hee.)

I am really not that picky but I have to say that I would not make this cake again. I couldnt find maple extract so I used maple syrup and cut down on the sugar. Maybe that was a bad idea because the cake was not very sweet and really didnt have much flavor. However, I really didnt like the texture much either. I am an ingredients snob and used plugra butter and very fresh eggs, from local chickens and ghiradelli chocolate chips but to no avail. I gave it two stars due to the fact that maybe my substitutions were the cause, but from reading the other reviews, I really dont think so. My only thought is to add more sugar and use sour cream instead of buttermilk. My recommendation is to use the sour cream streusal coffee cake listed on this site. That is heavenly.

My co-workers liked this cake much more than I did. The texture was a little off (crumbly, not as tender as I would have liked), and the taste was just so- so. It also wasn't sweet enough. The recipe was proportionally similar to my favorite tried-and-true pound cake recipe, minus one egg and half the sugar. If I were to make this again (and I doubt I will), I would add an egg and at least another half cup of sugar. The glaze, however, was fabulous. I will definitely make that again for another cake!

Great cake...go easy with the nonstick spray. I found it leaves residue on the cake that looked and I scraped off. After glazing though, it was not noticeable and I did not detect any "tatse"

This was very good and easy. I used bittersweet chocolate chips. Baked 50-55 minutes. Buttered and floured the pan, but did not also spray it w/vegetable oil spray as stated in the recipe--that seemed strange. It did not stick to pan.

I used hazelnut flavored coffee to grind for the expresso. Flavor combo was great. Everyone loved it.

I too had trouble with the texture of the cake. In addition, it took longer than 1 hour to bake. When the cake was finally done, the cake had sunk in the pan! So needless to say, it was very dense and almost greasy. I'm not sure what went wrong. I've backed many cakes, but never had this happen.

Good cake! Texture was a bit more "granular" than I expected. The glaze was a must as it added some sweetness that was lacking in the cake for me. Would definitely make again.

this cake is great; very moist with a sort of carmel-like undertone to it. Some of my chips towards the top of the cake melted a bit so the appearance was not exactly ass pictured, but it still tasted great. I think next time, as as a variation to this recipe, I will try the cake without chips and than coat with some sort of chocolate espresso glaze

I enjoyed making this with my daughter. It was a great intro to baking for her. I cut back on the chips a bit, but the flour tip worked like a charm! It wasn't as moist as I would have liked it to be, but i am going to try it again and cook for maybe 45 minutes to see how it turns out. The glaze was a huge hit with and all in all the flavors were great together

The cake turned out just as pictured. I used a shot of espresso in place of the instant powder, and had to compensate with extra powdered sugar. I rate this as an overall success.

I made this cake last night and it got great reviews, though the glaze did not. My chocolate chips were perfectly suspended, so all I can think of is that those who had trouble worked them in too much causing the flour to release. A few quick folds is all you need. Next time, I will serve it warm with ice cream. Oh...I didn't use the maple extract either...just vanilla.

Rating: 4
For those w/ chocolate chip trouble: Use Mini chocolate chips (same amount) and FOLD into the batter. This always works perfect for me. Secondly, I've made this twice now and it's excellent. I did substitute almond extract for the maple (1 tsp) and used a 1 T of vanilla (my standard for poundcakes). This was truly excellent and recipe book worthy.

I made this cake today and was disappointed. Followed the directions to a tee, my chocolate chips also sunk to the bottom despite coating with flour. Didn't care for the texture, but loved all the mixture of flavors

Instead of using the maple syrup in the glaze, I added cocoa powder to taste. I also left out the maple extract in the cake, and used vanilla instead. I've made this cake 5 times in the past two weeks because everyone loves it. The ingredients are easy to have on hand.

This poundcake came together very easily for me. I served it as one of my dessert offerings for Rosh Hashana (for a "sweet" new year) The maple presence made this a delicious cake. Great with coffee the next morning, too.

I had trouble with this! For some reason my cake came out leaden and kind of gummy - not cake-y. It sunk in the middle slightly, also. I followed the recipe to the letter - double checked all my measurements - and have had several cake successes in the past. Perhaps I over-mixed the batter accidentally? If any cake experts out there know why this might have happened, I'd love your advice. I definitely want to try this cake again. Thanks!

This cake was very good but what made it great was the maple espresoo glaze. Good texture and stayed really fresh for a couple days.

everyone loved this cake. Did not use the maple extract or the espresso powder but it was still excellent. The cake alone without the glaze will be great also. Will make again.

I loved the cake - it baked up with wonderful texture, colour and flavour. I didn't enjoy the maple-espresso glaze, so didn't put it on, and it was great without it.

I was excited to make this after seeing it but must say I was disappointed. I thought there were too many flavors going on although coworkers thought it was very good. I doubt I would make this one again.

The cake was very moist and flavorful and quite light for a poundcake. The glaze looked beautiful drizzled on top. For some reason, despite tossing with flour, my chocolate chips all sank to the bottom.

This was the first recipe I made from the Oct 07 issue. It is fabulous - great brown sugar flavor, loaded with chocolate chips that stayed well suspended in cake and great maple espresso frosting.

Went together easily, baked up beautifully. A delicious dessert. The leftovers were yummy with our morning coffee. Used buttermilk in glaze instead of cream. My only change.
