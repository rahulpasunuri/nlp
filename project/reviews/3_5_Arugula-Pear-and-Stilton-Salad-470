I found the dressing quite boring and added balsamic and port. Also added fresh figs as I could not find good pears. Candied walnuts on top.

I made this salad every night for months last fall to take advantage of fresh arugula from the garden. A lovely salad. For variety, I used a dressing of 1/4 c. olive oil and 2 T. balsamic vinegar. Another option is Kraft Light Raspberry salad dressing. Top the salad with toasted and/or sugared pecans. Delicious.

Excellent and easy to make

Easy and delicious. I toasted some walnut meats (pecans would work well also), and mixed them in with the salad. This goes well before pasta dishes like lasagna or bolognese sauces.

I've made this recipe 3 times and it is a real winner - easy enough to accompany a weeknight meal if you have the ingredients on hand and special enough for entertaining. I am addicted to arugula, but I like to add either radiccio or red cabbage for more color. Stilton is best with this recipe, but gorgonzola or blue cheese works fine. Bosc pears are really nice since they are very sweet and firm when they are ripe. I took the advice to add toated pine nuts. Also, I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.

This was a great recipe! I toasted up some pine nuts with a little of the shallots and added it before the dressing, and it was wonderful! The cheese and pears go so great together. Make sure they're nice and crisp!

As the other reviewers suggested, I added toasted walnuts. No arugula was available, so I used curly endive and baby spinach. It was a HUGE hit and I really enjoyed it.

It's quick & simple to assemble & our Thanksgiving guests enjoyed it but it needs more color & texture. Next time we'll take the other reviewers' advice about adding some toasted walnuts or pine nuts. We'll also add some radicchio & probably go with a more savory vinaigrette. We used Maytag & you can easily cut back on the amount without losing any flavor - we used about half & that was more than plenty.

This is a good, easy recipe. Adds some toasted nuts and you have a variation of a salad recipe frequently listed on restaurant menues. Also many variations on Epicurious.

Arugula is my new favorite green because of this recipe, I added toasted pine nuts which was a good choice.
