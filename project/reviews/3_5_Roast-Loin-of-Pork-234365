Moist and easy to make but boring. It wasn't bad, but there was nothing about it that would make me want to prepare it again.

The recipe was easy and delicious. I served it with a salad, and it is very good for a spring dinner. Would recommend it to any level cook.

Really flavorful and tender; I didn't bother heating the milk for basting, and also threw half a sliced apple (will use more next time) in while roasting.

This was delish! I have never basted with milk and it made the pork very moist. I made a wonderful gravy with the juices. YUM!

Simple ande delicious! I added shallots with the rosemary, got more flavour.
