I have made this recipe multiple times and it always gets rave reviews. It is not too difficult to make, so it has become a go-to recipe for me. Definitely worth trying.

I made a couple of these for a large dinner party and got rave reviews. It was pretty easy to make and was a big hit. I actually had people ask me if I would wrap up a piece for them to take home! I am making another today for a picnic tomorrow.

This sounded delicious so I tried it. My company raved about it and it was simple enough to put together. I added about 2 TB of ice water to the crust recipe and it was easy to handle. I am not a milk chocolate fan but it worked well in this recipe. Very good!

Wickedly sweet, but oh, so good with fresh pecans. Be sure to make some coffee to accompany

We weren't too excited about the chocolate/pecan taste (and chocolate lovers ate it so they should have loved it and I used good Ghiradelli chocolate). Must have done something wrong given the rave reviews here, so maybe I'll try it again. The filling needs to be eaten chilled or it gets too drippy when it comes to room temp.

I made this tart last year for Christmas, and my family is demanding I make it again this year. Since I do a lot of cooking and baking, for them to remember something for a year is pretty impressive!

I found that the pastry was a pain to make. There is no way that it can be rolled. I ended up piecing it together in the pan. My guests raved about it.

Tip for toasting nuts: I place them in a nonstick skillet on top of the stove on medium-low heat and slowly toast, stirring often. Once the oils are released you will notice they will start to toast quickly so don't turn your back on them. Hope this helps.

No escaping it, this pie is tooth-achingly sweet, but deliciously so--it didn't survive to the next day when I made it for 8 people. I used dark chocolate in the filling and golden syrup (the UK equivalent) instead of corn and had no trouble with the caramel. Washing down the sides of the pan is key, I think. Also burned £3 worth of pecans before getting it right-- any tips on toasting nuts would be greatly appreciated as I burn them ALL THE TIME.

OH MY GOSH!!! HEAVEN IN A DISH!! I served this for a new years dessert party and had some coffee to go with it, but I couldn't stop eating long enough to sip my coffee. I didn't read the reviews prior to making, and I made as directed and I would NOT change a thing. I'm having it for breakfast now. I also served the tart with brown sugar whipped cream, found in a recipe on this site CRANBERRY GINGERBREAD WITH BROWN SUGAR WHIPPED CREAM. I invested in a whipped cream dispenser, which I highly recommend for ease (just shake, no whipping!), storage (air tight), and presentation (wouldn't you rather have a nice fancy dollop of whipped cream instead of a drop from a spoon?). YUM YUM YUM!!

I had the same problem melting the sugar with corn syrup as the last reviewer. This was solved nicely by adding a touch of water to the caramel mix (just enough to make a paste). As other readers suggested, I also cut back on the sugar somewhat as the tart would otherwise have been too sweet for my taste. My dinner guests were all pleased with the results, especially a certain pregnant lady who was craving chocolate at the time! Definitely a keeper.

Am not sure what happened to the caramel, but when I tried to melt the sugar and corn syrup over medium high heat, it wouldn't melt and I ended up throwing it out and using the tart shell to make another similar recipe from Epicurious using sugar and water for the caramel and it turned out great. I'd like to try this recipe again and would appreciate any suggestions on making the caramel.

This is a wonderful easy recipe to make. My only change was just adding 1 stick of butter to the crust. I kept it in the refrigerator, and it was still delicious four days later.

This tart is relentlessly sweet. I thought it would be like a cocolate turtle, but was disappointed. it has inspired me to create a tart of my own.

This dessert is wonderfully rich and decadant! Based on other reviewers recommendations, I used 8 oz. of Swiss milk chocolateinstead of 4.5, but everything else was as written. It was great! An excellent do-ahead dessert.

I'm saving this recipe, cuz I don't have time to make it right now - but it sounds so sinfully decadent that I've GOT TO try it!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! It could use a little more chocolate for the topping, but other than that...it is a keeper!!

Not only would I make this delightful tart - I eat it whenever I can, and it is one of our top dessert recommendations!! I work for all four Mon Ami Gabis, and it is equally as popular in each location! The Chocolate Pecan Tarte is worthy of all the praise it receives!!!
