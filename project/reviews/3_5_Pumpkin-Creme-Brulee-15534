Delicious with the perfect amount of pumpkin flavor!

This works fine as a dessert if you think of it as pumpkin custard with a broiled sugar topping, and not as "creme brulee." Williams Sonoma has a version on their site that uses half as much pumpkin. Oddly, the first time I had their version I didn't like it... not enough pumpkin! But it has grown on me, since the silkier custard has such luxurious mouth-feel. Also, the W-S recipe strains the custard, which removes any grainy squash threads, and adds a pinch of nutmeg.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was mediocre at best. The combinations sounded better than it was. I agree with the reviewer who said make pumpkin pie or creme brulee. The two do not mix.

I doubt that I experiment with this recipe to improve it. However, suggestions would be: 1) increase the pumpkin, 2)if using canned pumpkin, puree again in food processor since I found the texture too grainy when compared to creme brulee, 3) add more sugar, 4) increase spices a few dashes each. This recipe is easily overcooked, yet no time was given. 15-20 minuites, not a second more. I cook at home a lot and dine out in fine restaurants frequently. This recipe had potential, but doesn't sing!

Oh MY! This is a fabulous dessert. I upped the vanila Bean to 3. I also made my own pumpkin puree. I got a small sweet pie organic pumpkin, I cut it in 1/2, seeded it, took out the goop in the middle, dried it off, and drizzled a little canola oil on the 1/2's and put the 1/2's cut side down on a foiled cookie sheet and baked it at 350 for 1 hour. I scooped out the pulp, and I mushed the soft baked pulp with 3 heaping teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the othe spices reccommended (most of which were already in the spice blend) I added the pumpkin to the egg mixture, mixed well and let sit for 10 minutes, strained it through a collander to remove all of the big pieces and the vanilla beans, then through a fine strainer for a fine texture. WOW it was to die for. All the guests were so impressed. I will make this ALOT more.

This was ok, not great. After reading the other reviews, I went in expecting the consistency to be different than regular creme brulee, and it was. Nonetheless, this dessert just didn't do it for me. Stick with either regular pumpkin pie or regular creme brulee - combining the too was not spectacular.

I halved this recipe and it was FABULOUS!!! I have to comment to the person that said it didn't taste like true creme brulee - this is true, but you have to take into consideration that you are adding PUMPKIN so of course the custard will take on a different texture. So, that being said, it was excellent and I found that in my first attempt at this recipe, the spices didn't mix in very well to the cream/egg mixture, so I recommend incorporating the spices into the pumpkin puree first, that way they will be well blended. I also used light brown sugar for the tops. I have a trick for creme brulee that I like (especially when making for a crowd): Make the caramel syrup on the stove in a saucepan first and spoon over the tops of the custards and give it a little swirl - you will get perfect sugar crusts EVERY TIME.

I liked this recipe, perfect for the hoildays! I halfed it and it turned out fine, I over cooked it a little, but after reading the reviews I'll know not to let it cook so long. I can't seem to get the sugar top to carmelize, I'm not sure if it's the sugar I'm useing or the tourch. Other than that Its a perfect blend of flavors!!!!

Creme brulee is one of my favorite desserts. The texture on this recipe is good, but the pumpkin flavor is not very pronounced.

I reduced this receipe but it really tasted like and had the consistency of a custard. A good, pumpkin flavored custard not a brulee. Help!! What did I do wrong?? Great taste but not a true brulee consistency.

Great recipe. Very creamy. I forgo the ramekins and water bath and use a spiced tart dough shell instead. It works great! A nice alternative to the traditional Libby's pumpking pie. Pre-bake the tart shell before adding the custard. This won't take as long in the ramekins. About 20 minutes max. Check before it's done though. It might take less. Works really well in individual tart shells as well.

This was very good, and a nice change from the usual pumpkin pie. Keep in mind that the cooking time will vary depending on the size of your ramekins. I found the times suggested here much too long for my small servings. Remember that you want to cook it until it's set on the sides, but still a little wobbly in the middle. It will set as it chills.

Great dish - perfect texture, just the right sweetness, just the right amount of pumpkin. Recipe doesn't make 14 servings -- at least with 6oz ramekins - more like 9-10.

Follow the recipe, including all of the spices and it is FABULOUS!! I made this for Thanksgiving after a first unsuccessful attempt. After I read the reviews, it came out perfect. Make sure to bake for at least 35 minutes and don't make the water bath too high (the water sloshed into my ramekins during my first attempt). Invest in a handheld kitchen torch. Its worth the money once you see and taste the finished product. tres gourmet!!

I just made this for Thanksgiving and every one loved it. I also halved the recipe and baked in 2 oz deep ramekins for 1 hour.It was creamy and delicious, a real winner!!

after a first unsuccessul attempt at making this -- my water bath "sloshed" into my ramekins! I gave this another go...it's a shame no guidance for cooking time is given - i found that 35 minutes was sufficient to set the custards. also, be careful not to make that water bath over half the height of the ramekins (ok, ok, ok... i learned this the hard way!) also, 1/8" sugar layer is too much - the crackle layer ends up becoming too thick and i feel like i had to wait *forever* with my blow torch for the whole sugar top to carmelize...when i did abt a 1/16" layer, that was perfect and still gave a solid crackle-ly top layer. now that i have this down, it's a must for Xmas With The In-Laws...wish me luck!

My family and friends thought this was terrific. I omitted the pie-like spices, namely the allspice, cinnamon and ginger, and it was great. I halved the recipe, since it was for a few people. I used this as the base, just omitted the spices, and it was creamy, delicious, and not too pumpkiny (?) at all. There was just a hint of the pumpkin, and it did NOT taste like pumpkin pie after these mods. I want to try it with the spices now, to compare/contrast the flavors. This one is going to be a regular fall favorite, as its already been requested again after only 2 weeks!!!

We halved this recipe; used whipping cream instead of heavy cream; vanilla extract rather than vanilla beans & omitted the ginger. Still, this was very simple & received rave reviews from all of our Thanksgiving guests. I thought it was delicious, but then I'm a lover of any style pudding, custard or brulee.

I read the other reviews here first and HALVED the amount of pumpkin I used and the pumpkin was STILL overpowering!. It was good (for pie filling) if I try it again, I will quarter the amount of pumpkin at most.

An excellent dessert! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone was looking for seconds. It's a great alternative to the traditional pumpkin pie.

We have now made this recipe twice, both times to rave reviews. Rated by 2 creme brulee fanatics as better than the Hotel duPont's in Wilmington and the Phoenecian's in Phoenix. We found the pumpkin flavor light, not overpowering.

Tasted just like pumpkin pie filling without the crust rather than a light airy brulee. I happen to love pumpkin pie, but I was looking for brulee!
