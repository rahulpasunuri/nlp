I wasn't fond of the ginger syrup with the fruit. But the syrup added to club soda makes a terrific ginger ale!

I made this fruit salad with a mix of mangoes, kiwi, apples, plums, and pineapple. The ginger and mint adds a nice fresh flavor. I thought it was a nice choice for a Passover seder.

I was just surprised to find that I hadn't previously rated this, as it has become a house staple. The original surprise: something this simple could be this marvelous. It is deserving of four forks as it is elegant in its simplicity, versatility and ability to transform simple food into something much more memorable. I agree with others: even a so-so melon has the potential to become great with a bit of this treatment. In addition to the original recipe, here are some recommendations & modifications: 1. Steep longer. Less sugar is fine but use some Splenda and some honey. Often I don't use any white sugar at all. 2. Make lots. Commonly I increase by 50% or more.I find that it * keeps very well and I use lots; * is just as easy to make a lot as a little; * is nice to keep on hand as a quick small gift (I purposely buy some or the honey that I use year-round in little squeeze bottles, then reuse those bottles for ginger syrup gifts); * syrup can be useful for people prone to upset stomachs and nausea. 3. DRINKS: Above all, I recommend GINGER LEMON- (or lime-)ade. Also add to iced tea or hot tea. 4.In the heat of summer make MINT simple syrup OR ADD MINT to SOME of the GINGER SYRUP for an alternate quick change. Then guests can easily personalize iced drinks. 5. Add in small amounts when making JAMS, PRESERVES or conserves (e.g., pear). (Taste in a tiny anount first!) 5. The ginger coins can often be used like preserved ginger.(Think ginger biscotti) Process with brown sugar and keep on hand for baked apples or cereal. 7. Some folks eat the "coins" like candy!

Too sweet! I would only use the syrup if the fruit wasn't completely ripe. Next time I am going to juice my ginger for the bite I was looking for!

The ginger and mint truly enhanced the fruit salad. All of the girls at my party had the fruit salad with dinner, and then went back to it for dessert! And, we used the ginger syrup in gin and tonics and vodka tonics. So refreshing!

Just the right balance of flavor for fresh fruit.

Everybody loved this! We used nectarines, plums, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries. It's a beautiful salad. The recipe makes way more syrup than you could use for one batch of the fruit salad, but like somebody said, it was good in iced and hot tea. The leftover fruit salad with ginger syrup makes great pancake/waffle topping the next morning.

Yes, this really was good. I used strawberries, grapes and cantalope balls. This is a bit better than the mint, sugar and vanilla with strawberries and grapes on this site.

I forgot what a "kick" ginger has to it, so after I made the syrup and tasted it, I decided to make half of it with the syrup (so good!), and half without for the young kids who were going to eat at our bbq also. I really can't wait to make ginger/lemonade with my meyer lemons!

I must admit that I love anything involving ginger... that being said. We have had this on a variety of fruits since we made it - cantaloupe, peaches, berries of all sorts, mango, watermelon, oranges - and it is delicious. When I made the syrup I added lemon balm during the 15 minute steeping period and it turned out lovely.

We've made this probably 7 or 8 times, usually for guests as part of a brunch. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. It is easy and terrific.

I made this for a potluck brunch. People said it was the best fruit salad they had ever had. The ginger and mint really add something. It wasn't life-changing for me personally. (But is fruit salad ever?) But as far as fruit salads go, I guess this is one of the better ones. I would def. make it again.

I'd give it 2.5 forks. I was a little disappointed - the ginger flavor did not come through as much as I had expected. It did give a little extra sweetness, however, and the mint was a nice addition. I used pineapple, peaches, nectarines & berries. Overall - subtle improvement on simple fruit salad.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I made this for a pot-luck, so I didn't mix the fruit with the ginger syrup - I had them separate and people simply spooned the sauce over the fruit. They loved it! For fruit I used cantaloupe, pineapple, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and green & red grapes.

This is a delicious fruit salad! It is great served as a part of any meal (breakfast, snack, lunch, dessert). The fresh mint is very refreshing. The ginger syrup recipe is also wonderful and great for many uses.

Rating: 4
Subtle yet powerful ginger taste, if that makes sense... it really brings out the natural flavor of the fruit, and though i was skeptical, the mint adds a lot too. I can't imagine ever having fruit salad without it again! I was worried that I wouldn't choose the "right" fruits, but really any fruit would work, from pineapple to banana... I used white nectarines, cantelope, strawberries, and canned mandarin oranges.

This is such a great, easy summer dessert recipe. The ginger and mint add such fresh and subtly zingy flavors! We have had this many times!

Excellent! Simple and tasty! I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it still yielded a good amount. Used 1/4 cup in the fruit (honeydew, cantalope, and watermelon) and using the rest in my morning coffee.

I just loved this recipe. It is so simple and adds such an unexpected welcome flavor to fruit. I love it so much I am thinking of other ways to use it!(I poured it over brownies-that was amazing) I also let it steep longer and let it marinade longer as suggested.

A ginger fan, I'm making a big batch of the syrup to keep on hand in the fridge. I doubled the amount of syrup called for and poured it over red and green grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, and peaches. I also let the fruit marinate a little longer than suggested. Refreshing! I can't wait to add some syrup to hot and iced tea. What a simple, good recipe!

If you enjoy flavor of ginger, the syrup is great!! Besides fruit salad, I used the syrup as an addtion to a stir-fry sauce that I make, using a Chinese shredded pork with red peppers recipe. It added a nice touch.

I didn't make the fruit salad, just the syrup, and it was great. I served it at a dinner party where guests could add it to their drinks and everyone loved it. It made a subtle, nice touch. I wasn't paying attention to the instructions and peeled and minced the ginger. I also let it steep for about an hour. Lots of ginger flavor without the bite.

I'm surprised to see less than stellar reviews on this because we thought it was amazing! The ginger was strong and spicy, which we all thought was great. We served this with asian almond cookies. I'd describe this as a grown-up, refreshing, elegant dessert. Loved it!

This didn't do anything for me; neither with the fruit or adding the leftover syrup to other things. Sorry.

I made this for a 4th of July (well, on the 5th, actually) brunch, with cherries, strawberries, white peaches, and blueberries. I made the syrup exactly as described, tasted it, and decided to let it steep some more while we watched the fireworks; it must have been a total of about 4 hours. Right after simmering, all I could taste was the 'bite' of the ginger, but after steeping it mellowed out and I could taste the actual ginger flavor. 1/4 c was plenty on the fruit, which wasn't strongly gingery, but you could tell it was there. The syrup was also good, if extremely subtle, in my orange juice this morning.

I will let the syrup seep as one person suggested. I was disappointed the first time I made this but will give it another try.

I feel just terrible for all the people who got a too-sweet or no-ginger-taste syrup, because I got something fantastic. With only 1/4 cup syrup needed for 4 cups of fruit, I cut the recipe by half. Because of the no-ginger-taste reviews I was prepared to let it steep for hours. I let it steep for around 30 minutes then tasted it, which is good because it had a surprising bite. Must be the quality of the ginger I used. Really good with raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, mango, peaches and nectarines, totally enhancing the fruit flavors, with a refreshing underlying mint. Love it! Great either by itself or on top of vanilla ice cream, and the extra syrup is divine in so many drinks. Mmmmmm! Very refreshing.

I looked forward to making the ginger syrup because I love ginger. I reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups, and expected a great ginger flavor. I was so disappointed...it seemed exceedingly sweet to me, and not very gingery. The fruit I used was ripe, so it didn't benefit from the sugar. I'll try it again with less water and less sugar and see if it's as delicious as others found it to be.

I thought this was good, not great. We really didn't taste the ginger at all. Maybe it accentuates the taste of the fruit? I guess my husband and I prefer strong flavors.

I agree with the other reviewers - this is an easy twist on fruit salad. Also, we used the syrup as a sweetener for Barefoot Contessa's iced herbal tea. It added the sweet taste and the ginger added great depth of flavor.

Very good, passed with my husband, a fruit purist.I substituted 1 cup of Splenda for 1 cup of sugar, and added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I was initially concerned because the syrup had a bit of a bite, which I like, but maybe too spicy for others. The fruit juices seemed to cut the bite and it was a thoroughly yummy fruit salad. Blueberries, strawberries, nectarines, peaches, cherries (pitted) and a banana.

I fell asleep while simmering the syrup and ended up with ginger-caramel syrup! Hot water saved the day. For fruit, I used nectarines, peaches and strawberries and spooned the salad over Gourmet's buttermilk sherbert for a scrumptous dessert.

To Linda, I made this with Splenda-halved the recipe-1c.granular Splenda, 1 1/2 c. water, 1c. ginger-and followed recipe, except left out mint as didn't have any. This really was good with a melon which didn't have much flavor & sliced strawberries. My husband is diabetic so always trying to use sygar subs.

Not having time to make the ginger syrup, I added finely chopped candied ginger and fresh lime juice to my cut up melon, blueberries, strawberries, figs and mango. Very refreshing and light dessert. Gave my guests the choice of a variety of ice creams and sorbets, chocolate or raspberry syrup and it was a hit.

I was wondering if a sugar substitute, like Splenda, could be used in the recipe. Has anyone tried that or have any suggestions for cutting back on the sugar? Thanks!

We loved this! The ginger syrup somehow just enhances the individual fruit flavors--it is a true complement rather than a "dressing". We are not big fans of fruit salad--often find the dressing overwhelming--but this is delightful. An elegant way to dress up fresh fruit for company without ruining it.

This was fabulous. I was looking for something different to do with fruit and I've found it. I did this with just berries: strawberries, blackberries and raspberries, and my guests just kept scooping out more and more until it was gone. The ginger is an excellent balance with the sugar, and the mint adds such a great touch, too. I'll definitely serve this often throughout the summer.
