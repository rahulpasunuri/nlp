This is not one of the tastier corn breads that I have come across. My family felt traditional corn bread was preferable to this one, but with all the great corn bread recipes on epicurious I wouldn't bother making this one again.

Recipe was easy, came out nicely moist. Kept well in fridge. Only negative would be high fat content. I had leftover coarse cornmeal from Thanksgiving, and used it. Next time, I would use a finely ground cornmeal, as it was a bit gritty even though a wet batter. Not phenomenal but quite good!

I made this for a picnic and everyone loved it. Used medium grind cornmeal which provided a great crunchy texture, and substituted buttermilk for the milk. I liked the sweetness it had, but could go lighter as well. This one will be remade often.

Liked the taste and texture of this, but when I made it the 2nd time, omitted the sugar, relying just on the molasses for sweetness, and thought that was enough. A good accompaniment to chicken.

You look at it and think, "eh...corn bread...big deal" you taste it and think, "ummmmm....corn bread!"

End result was very good, although I did have a significant problem with the recipe: after baking the bread for the prescribed 35 minutes, a tester through the middle came had no crumbs, and I assumed the corn bread to be done. Afer letting it cool for 10 minutes, however, I flipped the loaf pan and runny batter came leaking out onto because the bread was not cooked all the way through. I managed to salvage most of it, gave it about 12 more minutes in the oven, and then it came out beautifully. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's moist, delicious, and great with chili, but not a typical corn bread, in case that's what you're looking for.

This is a wonderful recipe as it is, no need to improvise! I served it with Beef Picadillo Chili, a wonderful match!

This is a great recipie - Very moist and very tasty. We wanted it to be on the sweeter side and so we added another tablespoon and half of sugar. The molasses is very subtle and gives it a great flavour.

Came out very nicely and was terribly easy. The result was moist and somewhat dense, the texture more like a quick-bread than a cornbread. (It also looks more like pumpkin bread than cornbread because of the color of the molasses.) It's not at all sweet, and if you prefer a sweet bread, you may want to increase the sugar.

This was extremely tasty--very moist and flavorful. Take care to watch it during the last few minutes of cooking. The amount of butter makes the top prone to scorching.

Excellent quick bread, moist with a hint of sweetness from the molasses. Perfect with hot, spicy chili. Definitely a keeper.
