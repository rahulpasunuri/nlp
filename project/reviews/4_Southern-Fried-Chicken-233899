I traveled to New Orleans a few years ago and came back home determined to learn how to cook Southern Fried Chicken. Many failed tries later, I finally stumbled on this recipe. The additional notes were crucial in making it correctly. Thank goodness someone added them because every other recipe leaves out this kind of important information. I used a whole cup of evaporated milk instead of adding water, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly - with perfect results!

I made it just as instructed and it was delicious. Like other reviewers I would put some more cayenne or cajun spice next time. Even cold the next day it was tasty. A keeper.

Even if you don't have a cast iron pot, a Magnalite as recommended, you can fry chicken in any pan as long as you use shortneing. Crispy every time! http://imunchie.com/oliviab/munchies/pan-fried-chicken

This recipe is a great base. I substituted the PET, for sweetened condensed milk. I also added Vulcan Fire Salt, from my local Spice House. The breading still clung perfectly.. Delicious

tried it out as a surprise for the kids and they ate it up............ I also enjoyed it myself of course next time I will add some cayenne or Cajun seasoning for the adults to give it that super kick of spice.

I made this as a Father's day treat for my husband and he absolutely loved it as did my picky 4 year old. I think it is a great recipe that I will continue to make, though next time I will kick up the seasoning a little bit.

I had the privilege to meet Miss Leah many, many years ago. She's the reason I asked for Magnalite cookware when I got married! Incredibly beautiful woman, inside and out. I used to have this cookbook years ago, but lost it with so many precious others due to Katrina. Though I have this particular recipe engraved in my memory, it's nice to have a copy, along with the quotes and story. Thanks Epi!!

Great recipe, and easy peasy, if a little splattery. I started making another 3.5-fork rated one from Epicurious, then saw the milk/egg bath part of this recipe and had to switch! So, my chicken was rubbed with a herb, pepper & salt combo before, then done like Chase does it. Yum yum!

Easy recipe and easy to play with the seasoning, but it took longer to cook. Not as good as Hatties Chicken Shack, though.

As a self respecting southerner this makes a very good fried chicken. Switch the marinade for buttermilk, hot sauce and salt and pepper and let it sit for a couple hours at least

My cousin and tenant is a Carolina boy and he admits this is about the best fried chicken he's ever had (certainly the best north of the Mason-Dixon). I use chili powder, garlic salt, and sometimes a touch of curry powder for spice (along with whatever else is handy and smells compatible). It works great with corn flour for a gluten free recipe!

This recipe is awesome! It's the first time I've cooked fried chicken and I'm southern:) It was amazing. Will surely cook this again!

Real easy and real good.

I made this for the family and everyone liked it (kids 7&9 and wife). The recipe was simple except that it took much longer to cook than the recipe called for. I think I cooked for almost 25 minutes before it was done.

I laughed out loud when I read the requirement of Pet Milk for this recipe. First because I havent seen or heard of Pet Milk for years and second because I was reminded of a very dirty joke La Wanda Page used to have in her stand-up routine about an entry in a jingle contest, I like Pet Milk because& Do they still make Pet Milk?? Anyway, this is a good, basic recipe for real Southern fried chicken (unlike the atrocity of the same name also found here on Ep.com). My only quibble would be that, in my part of the south (Mississippi), my grandmother didnt use, have, or even know about garlic, thyme or paprika. Her spice repertoire was exhausted with salt and black pepper, so, only fried chicken seasoned thusly tastes Southern to me. Also, I have heard of people using evaporated milk for the soak, but I consider buttermilk essential for fried chicken to be Southern fried chicken. Oddly, this recipe is different from the on Leah Chase included in Madam Childs, In Julias Kitchen with Master Chefs. There, she seasons the flour with Lawrys Seasoned Salt and pepper only. Thats a bit closer to my conception of Southern than the recipe here. Nits having been picked, this recipe certainly deserves a solid 3 forks.

I'm making this tonight. Made it last month, and it was wonderful. I know...it's FRIED, but you don't eat it every week. This is an excellent comfort food, and if you follow the recipe exactly, you won't be disappointed.

The recipe is great. The other thing I wanted to mention is Magnalite is not cast steel, it is cast aluminum. I have no problem with it except some people don't like to cook in aluminum pans. Enjoy the chicken!!
