Disappointed with this recipe. The method is easy, but the marinade is not distinctive. I tried to pimp it up with some additional spices but the store bought tikka overpowered everything else. They were moist and easy, but I was left wanting something more exciting.

This is a great summer recipe.It's easy and the marinade and sauce can be made in advance. I serve this for dinner along with some summer salads. I think it is a great company recipe for the warm months.

We broiled the chicken chunks without skewers, about 6 minutes each side. It came out delicious. Served it with rice. It's easy and could be prepared ahead of time for a party. Very flavorful!

I made this recipe with chicken breasts that we cooked on the barbecue. It was delicious and both my husband and son liked the chutney (which had a nice bite to it). I served the chicken with carrots in a yogurt sauce with cardamom, couscous, and a cheese jalapeno bread.

3.5 Forks. Super simple and tasty. I did mine on the grill and used Greek yogurt instead of just plain. I also recommend the Traditional Raita recipe as an accompaniment for those who won't be able to handle the chutney.

excellent recipe and perfect for a party. make sure to have extra yogurt, I added more at the end to make the dipping sauce thicker.

We love Indian food, but I think I overdid the jalapeno on this one. Was convenient-marinated the chicken overnite in the yogurt mixture. Not our favorite but I would make again with a lot less jalapeno.

It rocked! I used 1 lb of chicken (instead of 1.5) but it came out just as good. And I used lime instead of lemon. I made it with my friend's aloo gobi recipe, rice and garlic naan. I would make this many times over.

Terrific! I did strain the yogurt and I also added 1/2 of a jalapeno. The chutney was everyone's favorite.

Fabulous!!! Made for a Christmas Cocktail party...prepared chutney and marinade day before, added marninade to chicken and broiled before guests arrived and left out on table as a standing appy. Everyone loved...tasty and pretty. Made exactly as recipe!

dinner plans changed unexpectedly earlier this week, so I threw the marinating chicken and the just-made chutney into the freezer. I thawed both out this evening on a lark and wow! they came out just perfect. great to know that this can function as one of those emergency, last-minute-guest dinners too.

I have not made this dish, but straining the yogurt with a coffee filter for 1/2 hour may help the running chutney problem.

our grill was out of gas, so I baked the chicken pieces in the marinade on a cookie sheet for 20 min at 400f. served with the chutney plus jarred mango chutney, rice and vinegared tomatoes. simply divine! oh so little prep and a terrific result that everyone devoured.

This was FANTASTIC! I made it with swordfish and cooked it on the grill - delicious. I made extra marinade to try it with chicken tonight. I'm sure cooking it in the oven is also good, but the grill gives it a wonderful flavor. Surprisingly quick. The marinade whips up in minutes and the chutney is fast in the blender. No chopping!

Incredible recipie. Made this dish for a cocktail party and it was a huge success. My only mistake - I thought the amount of chutney was too small so I doubled it. Guests only use a small amount to compliment the chicken.

I love lettuce wraps of all kinds, so this was good but not the best I've had. Used tandoori paste which made for great chicken but may have been too dominant a flavor (?). Chutney was pretty spicy and a bit runny, and found wraps tasted better with a mango chutney I also made. Will try again with different curry paste, definitely worth messing about with.

I served these to round out an appetizer and wine party when I relalized that some guests would not have eaten dinner yet. They were a huge success, and looked just beautiful. The chutney made a lovely presentation and really finished the dish. I highly recommend it, if nothing else than for an aesthetic compliment, especially since it is so easy. It is a great dish to begin ahead of time and do all the prep in the morning. My only change was baking rather than broiling (since my broiler runs extremely hot). Just a word of caution: at first taste, the chutney seems VERY hot. Don't thin it down with more yogurt immediately (as I did, in anticipation of my guests' rather sensitive tastebuds!), because it mellowed out tremendousely as it sat. It definitely works well as a substantial appetizer that compliments other tastes. Curry, but not overpowering.

Having eaten this dish in India, I was skeptical that it could be this easy and taste good without a tandoori oven. I was wrong on both counts, it was easy and delicious. The chutney had enjoyable flavor, but a little runny, next either less yogurt or less blending.

The chicken was great, however the chutney was way too watery. I used a peanut sauce and tossed the chutney down the drain!

This dish is fabulous. My husband and I both loved it. The recipe works. I suggest following it to a t. I marinated for 8 hours. This is by far the best Epicurious recipe that I have ever made. I served it with Cilantro Coconut Rice rather than over lettcue and cukes. I will make this for us and for company often.

I have used this basic recipe (using my own home-made curry paste) both as kebabs and as a chicken curry to serve over basmati rice. It is delicious and particularly good with the wonderful cilantro-mint chutney, which I always double because my family likes it so much!

Delicious! I cut the chicken in strips, more like satay. Couldn't find the mild curry paste, used Thai red chile paste and cut back to 1 tsp. and skipped cayenne, per previous reviewer. Chutney was a bit watery, ended up straining it and adding more yogurt to thicken. Need to double chutney recipe to get volume shown in photo. Easy to grill in advance and reheat before serving.

This was a great appetizer! I marinated the chicken pieces in gallon-sized zip lock bags and stored in the refrigerator. After placing the meat on skewers, I grilled them on the grill. Use caution not to get the skewers too close to the flame. This was a great spring-time party appetizer. I grilled these the afternoon of the party and then warmed about 10 minutes in the oven before serving. Great dish! I also think this would work well for a sit-down dinner by simply using whole, boneless chicken breasts.

Made for a New Years party with mixed reviews. Those who like curry and quite spicy loved it. I would make the chicken pieces more like 3 or 4 inces long rather than 2 inch squares.

I used red Thai curry paste, which is considerably hotter than what the recipe suggested. I compensated by cutting the amount to one tablespoon and omitted the cayenne pepper. I marinated the chicken for about five hours and it turned out great.

This was a huge hit at my party. I made the marinade and the cilantro chutney the day before and used boneless skinless chicken thighs and Patak's curry paste. I skewered the chicken and then stood the skewers up in a glass loaf pan and poured the marinade over the chicken. The day of the party I just layed the skewers on a baking sheet with the sticks hanging over the edge and covered them with a sheet of foil. No need to soak the skewers because the tips are in the marinade and the rest is covered by foil. The picture doesn't do these justice. I passed them on a tray lined with a banana leaf and they were gobbled up in spite of all of the other appetizers.

This recipe was very good I used a mild Curry since i didn't have any Tikka. It was spicy but that just enhanced the flavor. I BBQ it wich was excellent definetly will do this again

This is very tasty! I used only 2 tablespoons fo curry paste instead of 3, and instead of dealing with the hot pepper i substitud some hot pepper sauce and some fresh sweet pepper. It turned out spicy, but not too hot. Will definately make this again.

I'm not a big chicken fan, but this was very flavorful. We grilled our chicken and served it over cilantro rice and grilled vegies. It was a bit spicey but not too spicy for my 6 year old. Definitely will make this dish again, don't change a thing in the recipe.

This dish was really spicy.

I am not a big chicken fan and loved this. SO flavorful and the sauce is thick enough that the chicken doesn't dry out. I marinated the chicken for 8 hours and basted each side once during the cooking. I had forgotten to get mint at the store (it's winter so my herb supply is gone) so I just opened a bag of herbal mint tea and it was just fine! This recipe may be a bit strong for some guests.
