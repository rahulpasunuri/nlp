This is on our regular rotation for special meals. Great for a crowd, and has a fabulous silky mouth-feel. Making it for Mardi Gras party next.

My mother inlaw made at Christmas, as written. Delicious. In fact, the best gumbo I've ever had.

I would never make gumbo like this. Water? You've got to be kidding. Throwing out duck fat is plain crazy, and moreover you would roast the duck whole in the oven first, pull the meat of, roast the carcass in the oven with mirepoix again to brown, make a rich stock out of the mirepoix / duck carcass - THEN you would add roux to that. Secondly the roux should be very dark for this one, in my opinion.

The duck and shrimp flavors compliment each other very nicely. A sophisticated twist on the usual gumbo! Thanks for the recipe.

The recipe was a big hit. I did brown rice (of course). I would add more shrimp next time. I added a little more cayenne than this recipe called for. I am from MS and have made a lot of gumbos in my day & while this does not have okra or file, I am cool with calling it a gumbo.

Discarding excess duck fat isn't just bad advice. It's a crime! Save it for sauteeing greens, roasted potatoes, etc. Even better: make cracklings. Fry any leftover duck skin in the excess fat, dry on paper towels, crumble & serve with the gumbo. Never, ever throw out duck fat. It's liquid gold!

I did the onion and red pepper in 1/2" dice, the celery and green pepper a little bit finer. I omitted the water, I didn't have my big pot available, and didn't miss it. The sauce came out very nice, not too thick not too thin. Also, pressed for time, I put the shrimp in frozen, cleaned but unpeeled. They took about 4 min. to cook. My three year old declared that he loves shrimp! That makes it a keeper for me!

Made this for Book Club last night and it was very tasty, different and presented well. Next time I would cut the veggies chunkier and omit (or at least reduce) the water. The finely chopped veggies didn't hold up to all the boiling as well as I would have liked, and there was too much "soup" left over. I also think some garlic, more cayenne, and twice as much shrimp would improve an already good recipe. I will certainly make this again!

A note for Lotuspub: a good cook will always saute the veggies for soups and stews (eg, the trinity of onion, carrot and celery). This step intensifies and enriches flavors, and must not be skipped.

This is not intended in any way to refute the comments from the previous user from Louisiana, just to privide a different perspective. When you're Cajun (or Italian, Mexican, Greek, etc.) it does get old to see the cuisine misrepresented. While the literal translation of gumbo is okra, the meaning of gumbo as a dish has evolved. My family of multiple generations of Cajuns only uses okra in certain gumbos. For example, a File Gumbo would not include okra, because the file takes the place of the okra which helps to thicken (file is ground sassafras leaves). Haven't tried the recipe yet and I know people hate that but I just wanted to add a different perspective. I love the idea of using the duck fat for the roux, but if I try it I'll add a bit of my cajun seasoning...& some file to replace the missing okra.

As any good Southerner knows, this isn't "gumbo" -- it has no okra! Gumbo is the African word for okra. This dish is "Duck and Shrimp Soup."

Good concept, and my results were excellent but you can skip the step of sautéing the vegetables "until crisp tender" -- they're going to stew for 90 minutes. I'm against frou frou stuff like this when it doesn't add to the recipe.
