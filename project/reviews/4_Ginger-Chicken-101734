Also works really well with skinless boneless breasts on a countertop grill. I put a little cheese in the mix and folded it all up together. Surprisingly wonderful and extremely simple.

Finally, an old recipre that gets it right. Be careful with the ginger, and be sure to grate it if possible, it can be overwhelming if too much is used. I make this for parties, and it never fails with a subtle, and authentic, flavor.

Don't discount this because of it's age. Chicken was very moist and I too am addicted to cilantro. Tossed cilantro and scallions in the rice I served with the chicken. Will do again.
