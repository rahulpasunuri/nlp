I made this for a dinner party. I didn't want to deal with making the whipped cream, so I just used ice cream. People FREAKED OUT. So did I. It was good.

Wonderful! Halved the biscuit recipe and made four servings out of that. ummmm, BC peaches....shall try this with mangoes when in Panama with much less sugar. Whipping cream was so tasty with br sugar and frangelico which I substituted for bourbon; also splashed some on the peaches. Sandra McNally

Very good. Easy to put together. I think this could easily serve 8 if not 12 people. The biscuits are so big I cut them on an angle and served the triangles. You'd have to have a very big appetite to polish this off as 1 of 6 servings, especially after a meal. No problems with the nuts sticking to the biscuits. Worked like a charm! This would lend itself well to other fruits.

Wow, is this dessert good. The flavors really compliment each other. With the biscuits, I didn't think the pecans would stick on top even with the egg white so I ground them up and added them to the batter. Also, I used a large juice glass (about 3" diam.) to cut them instead of making them square. They were perfect, and not too large. The only thing I would change is adding the bourbon to the peaches instead of to the cream. This is a wonderful, tasty twist on a classic. Both my parents attempted seconds. They parents were quite impressed.

I've made this several times and sometimes I just make some brown sugar peaches and serve them with mascarpone cream, which is in several other epicurous recipes and is delicious. The shortcakes are too large and I make them smaller but otherwise I leave everthing the same in the recipe. Awesome.

This recipe is wonderful. One of the best desserts I have ever made. Served it at a dinner party and it was the hit of the party. Even people on the Atkins diet that didn't want any bread...went back and had seconds of the biscuits!!!

I made these last night exactly as indicated and they were delicious. They could easily serve 8-10 as they were absolutely huge and way too much after a big meal. Next time I will add a little cinnamon to the pecans and to the peaches and make the biscuits slightly smaller. This is a great recipe!

Excellent dessert!!! The best part is when the juices mix with the biscuits and cream. I would make 1 1/2 times the peach recipe. Also, the biscuit are huge! I cut them in half for presentation, but they were so good, some went back for seconds!

This is an excellent recipe. The shortcakes are large but who cares -- they're delicious. The whipped cream is excellent and the peaches yummy. A keeper!

I was so very excited about trying this recipe. I was pretty disappointed, as it was good, but not great as I expected it would be. Because of the work involved, I probably won't make again.

mmm. normally i don't like bready desserts, but this was excellent. i made it with whole wheat pastry flour, and made 12 smaller scone-type things rather than six large biscuits. i cooked the peaches and brown sugar with a splash of bourbon just a little bit -- the peaches were still quite firm, about 10 minutes. and i replaced a tablespoon of sugar in the whipped cream with a tablespoon of molasses.

Delicious and easy. I could not find sticks of shortening and just used Crisco from the can with no problems. Each biscuit was large enough for two, I would recommend making 8 or 10 from the recipe instead of six large ones.

Man, this was good. Amazing what a little bourbon can do for whipped cream. I liked the ease of preparation of the peaches too. Definitely a winner, you've GOT to try it.

This was a fabulous desert. I would make the shortcakes smaller next time, however. They were huge! These would be great with any type of fruit or even as a "scone" with no fruit topping at all.

I made this over the weekend for my inlaws. It turned out very well. After comparing with other shortcake recipes, I only used 1/4 cup of shortening, which was plenty (in addition to the 1/2 butter, of course). I also added some cinnamon chips and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar. The peaches are a no-brainer, folks. Used softly whipped cream with a little sugar and vanilla, since some people present were no-alcohol types. The leftover shortcakes were delicious the next morning with strawberry preserves!

Thank you, Chicago! Now can we get some actual reviews of the recipe? I'd like to know if it's any good (as I can actually find the peach recipe...)

3 pounds fresh peaches, peeled, pitted, sliced lengthwise, slices cut crosswise in half 1/2 cup (packed) golden brown sugar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Gently toss sliced peaches, golden brown sugar, and fresh lemon juice in large bowl to blend. Let stand at room temperature until juices form, tossing occasionally, about 2 hours

Yes, but, I ask again how many peaches are used in the recipe?

Rating: 0
Don't know how many more ways it can be said: you click on the link for the peaches, and there you'll see exactly how many peaches you'll need for the recipe. Some cooks that log on are either very unobservant or very lazy.

This was not only easy, but elegant as well. I used "freestone" peaches and added a little more brown sugar to make a little sweeter. My husband absolutely loved it!

Please be sure and buy Georgia peaches, y'all!

This was quite tasty. We used a high nd bourbon and found it all quite elegant. While the biscuit dough was easy to work with we found that it made much more than the stated 6 servings. But that was not a problem at all. The comments about the missing peaches are pretty funny.

I substituted the bourbon for brandy. The brown sugar and brandy make the topping a little more sophisticated that your standard whipped cream.

Great stuff. Suggested changes: Add the bourbon to the peaches instead of the cream and also, put the pecans right in the biscuits instead of on top. Saves a couple steps and doesn't change the flavor at all.

I am just reading the recipe and from my experience I do believe the most important part of recipe is missing (peaches)?

Lovely recipe, worth the effort. I too am totally amazed that people didn't know how to find the recipe for the peaches. Where've you guys been?!?!

For those that cannot find the peaches follow the advice of the review telling where to look. I am just now going to try it it sounds great.

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. It did help considerably that I had fantastic peaches from the farmer's market.
