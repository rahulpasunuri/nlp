This is a delicious cheesecake. I thought it would be very dense and rich due to the 4 pkgs of cream cheese, but I whipped the heck out of it, and it ended up being light and lovely. I only had a 9" springform and I ended up having enough to fill another 5" springform pan too. I would definitely make it again.

A litte more time intensive than I thought but well worth it!!! This cheesecake will be an excellent addition to my repertoire. The puree is delicious and the filling is light and sinful...I made a slight variation. I cut half the sugar and added white hot chocolate powder it was fantastic!!!! Our clients (at work) will be pleasantly surprised :-)

I made a half recipe in my small springform pan. I still baked it for an hour. It was a huge hit with my book club. I used vanilla wafers and they were a little high in fat, causing the crust to be hard to cut through. The second time, I cut the butter in half.

I made a half recipe, in a small cheesecake pan. I only baked it for 45 minutes and think that 1 hour would have been better. I used vanilla wafers for the crust. I love cheesecake, but not graham cracker crusts, so this was wonderful. I love the cinnamon taste. Will definitely make it again for the holidays.

creamy. sweet and tart. This recipe creates a delicious cheesecake, unlike any i have encountered.Watch that when you boil the cranberry swirl, you don't cook it for too long or it won't swirl easily in the layers. It is a labour of love and well worth the effort. The compote is also delicious with icecream.

Made this cheesecake for an "Iron Chef" house party and it won for desserts! That means this totally deserves 4 stars! This was the best cheese cake I have ever made! But it is much better after it fully sets so be sure to make the day before!

I too am reacting to a modified version. I took the advice of a previous reviewer. I flavored the filling itself with orange zest (and a bit of vanilla.) I don't care for cookie-crumb crusts so I used a shortbread crumb crust that baked and later sliced beautifully. I saw no reason to make a separate puree/swirl mixture and then a compote. I tripled the compote recipe as written, and ran it through a sieve. It made a lovely swirl, and there was plenty left over for garnishing the finished cake. The raspberry flavor was overwhelmed by the cranberry and spice flavor; next time I may skip the raspberries. This was a big hit at a Christmas Eve dinner.

Loved this cheesecake, since I'm not a huge fan of too-sweet, too-rich cheesecakes. This had the perfect blend of tart & sweet. I actually prepared two versions of the cranberry puree for comparison purposes. One was the original recipe, and one was a modified version, where I omitted the orange zest (as this tends to make things bitter if you're not careful). I also substituted 1 tsp. orange extract for the 4 tsp. vanilla (way overkill on the vanilla!). I much preferred the latter and opted to use it in the cheesecake. (Served the other puree separately with vanilla ice cream another time.) Cheesecake came out beautiful, and I served it with the compote which was fabulous!

I was looking for the perfect recipe to cook use up all the dragonfruits in my fridge, I replaced the berries in this recipe with dragonfruit and i think i've got a winner :) It goes amazingly well with the recipe and i can't wait to try it again..the beet red colour of the dragonfruit makes the cake stand out on the table. Delicious :)

I've made this cheesecake twice now and it's always been a huge hit. I love the contrast of the sweet tart of the compote with the texture of the cheesecake. I use gingersnaps for the crust to give it a stronger flavor. I also garnish the top with fresh cranberries and white chocolate leaves (just spread some melted white chocolate on the back side of some leaves from a lemon tree in our garden, let chocolate harden in the freezer for a few minutes, and peel off the leaf). It's beautiful.

this cheesecake is SO GOOD - i didn't use the compote, but i used the leftover puree to make a marbled design on the top of the cake.

I have made a lot of cheesecakes in my time but this is the lovliest so far. I strained the sauce after other reviewers pointed out texture was an issue because of the rasberries. This was a very good suggestion. I disagree with those that feel the sauce is unnecessary. It is true that the cheesecake on its own is divine, but the tart crimson sauce really makes this out of this world. That being said, I reduced the vanilla in the cranberry filling and sauce. I wanted more of the fruit and spice to come out. I made this on Christmas and blew my mother- in-law out of the water. Because I couldn't find the suggested butter biscuits, I used some bourbon creams and almond biscuits and they made a lovely crust. I reduced the butter by a 1/3 and felt it was more than sufficient to bind everything together. The marbelling throughout the cake is beautiful. Make this to impress around the holidays.

What a beautiful and delicious cheesecake! I made this for Thanksgiving, and it met with rave reviews. We ate leftovers until Sunday night, and they were still delicious. I used vanilla wafers instead of butter cookies for the crust, but would also use graham crackers or ginger snaps. My compote was more layered than swirled, so I might fold in the cranberry and pour the entire filling into the crust next time. I didn't use the water bath, but baked for 15 minutes at 425, an hour at 250 and then cracked the oven door and let it cool for another hour. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for a Holiday party at work in 1998. It was such a hit that I have made it nearly every year since then around the holidays. Now my niece has requested that I make it for her birthday in July.

I made this cake for a dinner party and it turned out beautifully. I cut the sugar from the crust, and reduced the sugar in the filling to about 3/4 cup. Didn't have orange peel for the cranberry puree, so I omitted, but added some Grand Marnier. Curst was a bit too thick so next time I will use fewer biscuits. I also used yogurt instead of sour cream in the the filling, and substituted the whipping cream with just a dollup of coolwhip, as that was all I had on hand. The cake was quite rich and creamy, so I'm glad I didn't add the extra cream.

At the risk of aggravating readers, I'm posting this review on a much modified cheesecake. I used a chocolate wafer crust, as the combination of orange, cranberry, and chocolate is very nice. I used the cranberry compote but added spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice) and left out the orange juice. Instead, I flavored the cheesecake batter itself with some Grand Marnier and orange zest. I thought the cominbation was delightful: the contrast was now between the orange cheese filling and the tart cranberry compote swirled throughout. I recommend these changes if anyone is interested in making a slightly more complex and flavorful cheesecake.

Rating: 4
At the suggestion of other reviewers, I too reduced the amount of vanilla in the swirl and compote recipes, and substituted a gingersnap crust for the butter-cookie crust. I also used reduced-fat cream cheese and low-fat sour cream...neither of which detracted in the least from the luscious creaminess of the final product. The swirl was truly outstanding in its depth of flavor and smooth texture, and some of us felt that it alone could make the cheesecake; others felt that the compote was the final gilding of the lily--particularly because this was served as our Christmas dessert. Personally, I liked the combination of the swirl and the compote, both for the contrast in textures and the difference in flavors (cran-orange versus cran-raspberry). I didn't use the water bath to bake the cake, but rather used the method two others suggested: 425 for 15 mins, then 250 for an hour (actually, 75 mins), then an hour in the turned-off oven with the door ajar. No cracking, and a velvety, smooth texture. I hadn't made a cheesecake in quite a long time, but this recipe makes me want to do another one a lot sooner. A lovely holiday dessert that won't disappoint.

Rating: 4
I made this 3 times, and each time it got better. I sort of ad-libbed cooking instructions the first time since I had recently made another cheesecake; don't do that! I did use gingersnaps for the crust each time. Made the compote and I could not detect seeds, but I cooked it for about 20 minutes (carefully, not allowing it to get beyond a low boil). The last one I baked was really beautiful. I guess practice makes perfect. (Or as close as I can get!)

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this cheesecake! It looks fantastic too! The water bath definitely works. I agree with one reviewer about not needing the compote--it's very rich on it's own and the compote is a bit overpowering. My swirls in the middle of the cake also sank to the bottom, but doesn't take away from the looks at all! Can't wait to make again! DE-licious!!

Rating: 4
This cheesecake is fantastic! I was delighted. However, while the compote is nice and zingy, i think it becomes redundant given the cranberry sauce that is in the cake, and I even prefer the cake without it. The ribbons are lovely in flavour and appearance on the top of the cake. I made a gingersnap crust which, in a case such as this where the cranberry and spice go together so perfectly, it would be silly to use a butter cookie crust. However, i think that the unscrupulous use of vanilla (which is very expensive!) is unecessary in both of the cranberry compotes, as the citrus and spice are perfect and the vanilla only detracts from their flavour. In my opinion it should only be used for the actual cake. Btw, i used low-fat cream cheese and low-fat sour cream to make the cake slightly less cardiac-arrest inducing, and yet it was superb.

I made this for my book club holiday party and it was a big hit so I'm planning on making it for Christmas. It has great color, texture and a nice contrast in flavors. With the water bath method, this is an extremely creamy cheesecake, so if you are a NY style cheesecake fan, either adjust your recipe for no bath or skip it. I used graham crackers in the crust as I had forgotten to purchase the cookies. Next time, I'd use the pecan sandies or gingersnaps as other reviewers suggested. As with the other reviewer, I did not like the seeds in the sauce, so I both pureed it and strained it - you lose the effect of the texture but it beats seeds in my book. I also wanted the sauce to be more tart so I reversed the cranberry and raspberry proportions and it worked out great & cut the vanilla back to one tsp. in both parts (good suggestion - thanks!). Next time, I think I'll double the cranberry swirl and use that as the sauce, perhaps adding some brown sugar. Had no problems marbling the cheesecake but I had made both the crust and the sauce the night before and brought it back closer to room temp before swirling. One suggestion - give yourself a good four hours for the cheesecake to bake, cool in the oven & cool out of the oven before refrigerating it. I started this after work and was up very late waiting around for the cheesecake to cool enough to transfer to the fridge.

This is a beautiful and delicious dessert. I served it at a dessert luncheon where over 200 women were present, and I got so many comments that it looked like it came out of a magazine! I will say that I garnished it like they did in the magazine, with a whole raspberry and a mint leaf. The only difference was that the sauce in the magazine must have been strained, because there were no raspberry seeds in it, while mine had seeds. I couldn't find butter cookies at a reasonable price, so I just substituted a basic graham cracker crust, which was great with the other ingredients. I did worry about using the water bath method because I was afraid that the water might leak into the foil, but I didn't have any trouble with it. Next time I will be sure to have an extra large piece of heavy duty foil, instead of piecing two pieces together; then there should be no worry. The cheescake was very creamy and by using the water bath, there were absolutely no cracks on top! My cranberry swirls did tend to sink to the bottom, like other people had said, but I had a nice swirl on the top, where it really counted. I will definitely make this cheesecake again!

I did not use the cranberry in this recipe, but instead took some of the batter and added melted chocolate chips and swirled that in. Made a raspberry puree similar to the cranberry one, and used that as a garnish and sauce with fresh raspberries and mint. It was incredible. I had never made a cheescake this way with the water bath, but it came out perfect.

This is a wonderful cheesecake. Served it at Xmas and even my anti-cheesecake boyfriend loved it. Also used Simple Sandies but should have cut back on butter slightly. Can anyone suggest a good method for marbling the puree into the cheesecake? I thought I may have overdone the marbling, instead found many mounds that I began with. Perhaps I should have allowed the puree to warm a bit from 24 hours in fridge?

Very delicious creamy cheesecake. I almost didn't make the compote, but i'm glad i did because the cranberry flavor in the cheesecake itself was not as pronounced as i would have thought. but the swirl was very pretty and the compote was great flavor contrast with the cheesecake. the compote itself was good, but i agree that there was too much vanilla. i used about half the amount of butter to begin with in the crust, intending to add more as needed - it was not needed. i used sugar-free chocolate sandwich cookies and ground pecans for the crust, and used splenda in the cheesecake and the compote (husband is diabetic). he loved it, and ended up using some of the compote as his own sugar-free cranberry sauce with turkey.

Rating: 2
Although it was very creamy and quite beautiful, this was much too sweet for my taste. I also wanted a purer cranberry taste and, even though I cut down on the spices, it was still too much of a mish-mash of berry and citrus flavours. And way too much vanilla in the puree, even though I cut that a bit too. I absolutely agree that there was too much butter in the crust - what a mess! To be fair, though, most other people that tried it really liked it.

I waited until they were out of the house to make it so they wouldn't complain. Then, when I served it for a dinner party 2 days later, they thought it was the best cheesecake ever! I did sustitute frozen strawberries for the raspberries because I had them on hand. YUM!!!

Another of my extended family's favorites (I'm told that I shouldn't bother coming for the holidays if I don't bring this). I think the cookie crust is much better than a graham cracker crust with most cheesecakes. I've sometimes added a few ounces of melted & cooled white chocolate to the batter, too. The cranberry puree is delicious - I usually add a splash of Grand Marnier to it as well. I'll be making it again next week for Thanksgiving...

You have to make this beautiful cheesecake! I made it for our company Thanksgiving potluck and everyone raved. I used Mother's new butter cookies (they come in a box and are shaped liked flowers), and they worked beautifully, so look for them. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I also made the compote and per some suggestions, halved the spices and added a little more sugar. Didn't like all the raspberry seeds in the finished product, so I pushed the compote through a wire mesh strainer. The resulting sauce was smooth and fabulous. People put some on their cheesecake and after a bite or two, went back for more sauce. This is a very beautiful and delicious dessert and it's perfect for the holidays.

One of the creamiest, prettiest cheesecakes ever, w/just the right balance of tang and sweet! Previewed this to make for the upcoming holidays & was a hit. I did follow the suggestion of the Princeton reviewer to bake at 425* for 15 min, then reduce to 250* for 60 min, then let sit in oven w/door cracked open for another 60, foregoing the water bath. NO brown spots, NO cracks! To the reviewer looking for a good cookie to use for the crust, try Simply Sandies---the classic shortbread cookie---perfect! The one change next time is to reduce the amount of butter in the crust by 1/3; it oozed too much!

Be afraid. Be very, very afraid. The first time I made this cake, it disappeared out of the refrigrator two hours later and I never saw it again. My hubby and his friends, however, walked around with a silly grin on their faces for a week. The second time, I did have the pleasure of serving it, but only got one bite. That was all it took. I made the cheesecake a third time. I sat in front of the refrigerator with a shotgun across my knees and a fresh pot of coffee at my elbow. Finally!! I got a whole piece. Actually, I ate two.

This was a just okay cheesecake, nothing to write home about. Can't comment on the crust, I used Nilla wafers instead of butter cookies. But the cranberries in the cheesecake were very tart, and that pretty much ruined the whole cheesecake. The actual cheesecake batter was pretty good, and it would've been good overall if the cranberries were sweeter. A good recipe if you want something tart, otherwise, skip this one or up the sugar level.

This cheesecake was outstanding (but then, most cheesecakes are). What made it even better for me was that I didn't have to make the compote. I had homemade cranberry sauce leftover from Thanksgiving. The recipe was almost exactly like the one for the compote, so I substituted it. It worked wonderfully. The cranberry was too thick to work it across the whole cake, so I only made 2 layers of cake and cranberry. The cookie crust was delicious.

Now this is what I call a cheesecake. Delicious sweet cheesecake contrasts nicely with the tart swirl and compote. I liked the crust (butter cookies instead of the usual graham). The only setback, as one other cook noted, was that the baking time was SUBSTANTIALLY longer than the recipe calls for. In fact, I followed the recipe and after an hour in with the oven off (after baking) the middle was still liquid and I had to turn the oven back on and bake it again! I watched it very carefully and it turned out perfectly after that.

Imade this recipe for Christmas this year after reading all the rave reviews. My family loved it. The only thing I'd change is to add a little more sugar to the cranberry swirl or possibly the compote, as we all thought it a bit too tart for our tastes [we have sweet sweet teeth]. The cheesecake was easy to make and came out looking fabulous. Make sure to cool the cake just as the directions say, it is what keeps it from cracking. I also wanted to add that we used half fat free cream cheese and half nuefantal [sp?] to cut the fat. we also used fat free sour cream. did not seem to affect the taste at all and saved a TON of calories. =)

I have made this cake for the last 3 years around the holidays and I love it more each year. It is a bit of work and I no longer make the compote because I feel it's not needed since it only masks the cake's lovely flavor.

I made this for the finale of a New Year's Eve dinner. It was fantastic! However, I made two changes that worked really well. First, I substituted a gingersnap/pecan crust. Also, to make the cooking easier, I dispensed with the water bath. Instead, after wrapping the sides and bottom of the springform pan in aluminum foil (to keep the buttery crust from leaking) I baked it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, turned the oven down to 250 for an hour, then left it in the oven with the door open for about an hour longer. The cake was not cracked or brown, looked great, and was beautifully creamy!

This is a 4-fork recipe, definitely. I made it using a 9 3/4-in springform pan instead of the 10-in springform pan the recipe call for and it over cooked a bit, the top was a little brown.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner last year for my brother and his family from Oregon. I am sure the only thing they remember about the entire dinner was this cheesecake. It came out better than any cheesecake I have ever made. I made the puree 2 days in advance then the compote then the cheesecake. Wasn't overwhelming that way.

Extremely time consuming but YUMMY! The crust is fabulous. Very fluffy and not too rich. My mother (who doesn't care for cheesecakes) loved this one! Should even consider making it 2 days ahead...

I made this last year for our office Christmas party and it was a show stopper. Not only was it sinfully delicious it looked very festive. It will be a repeat this Christmas.

I made this with a gingersnap crust. I got rave reviews from everyone. It was a hit! Definitely will make it again.

I made this for a holiday party we had last year. It makes a beautiful presentation on a holiday buffet and tastes out of this world. Our guests were swooning over it and it disappeared very quickly. It'll become a holiday standard at our house.

I own a small tearoom in Dauphin Mb.Canada and I first made this recipe last Christmas season. It got rave reviewsfrom all my customers I have made it several times since using the batter recipe and serving it with different toppings. The cheesecake batter recipe is the best I have ever tried. I have not had the top crack since I started using this method. One customer orders this 'cake every time there is a birthday in the family.She serves it with a strawberry or a Saskatoon topping.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it got raves. The texture is light yet substantial, and the tartness of the fruit swirl is an ideal foil for the sweetness of the cheesecake nicely. A definite winner!
