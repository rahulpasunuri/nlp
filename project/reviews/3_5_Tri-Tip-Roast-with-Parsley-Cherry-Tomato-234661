The sauce that goes with this is great! I used it in scrambled eggs the next day.

This has worked perfectly everytime and the tomato relish is great in so many applications.

this was very good. I cooked the meat as stated and it came out perfect.The sauce is very good, though, I did not have as many tomatoes as called for. Served with corn on the cob, and hashbrowns.

I liked the sauce but the tri tip was really tough. This is my first attempt at a roast so I'm not sure if the problem was the cut of meat or the cook! Not sure if I'll make it again.

I have made tri-tip many ways; this was one of the easiest, and yet, most tasty. I did salt and pepper the meat about 3 hours before cooking - having read in the Zuni Cafe cookbook recently about the benefits of salting meat early - and I must say, the meat was much more flavorful than ever. More so than with the usual marinades that many tri-tip recipes suggest. Not having a cast iron pan, and having an oven that does not permit a skillet on the top shelf, I browned the meat on the stovetop and then placed it on a preheated baking sheet. It cooked a bit more rapidly than I expected, slightly beyond medium, but really excellent. I substituted roma tomatoes (cut in half, seeded) for cherry tomatoes, but wow! What a great condiment for the meat! I highly recommend this recipe - although I made this for a simple weeknight dinner, I would feel quite comfortable serving it for any meat- eating guests.

Fantastic! Especially great during tomato season. This try tip always turns out perfectly, which I can say with absolute confidence since I've made it a dozen times. You MUST HAVE an instant read thermometer. Baking it to 130 degrees, then resting 10-15 min. makes it a perfect med. rare in the center, while the ends are med. to welldone.

Soooo good, you have to try it! Makes a great quick and easy main dish for a dinner party.

Loved this! The colors make it a wonderful holiday dish. I like to leave a few tomatoes "unpopped" for a garnish and the pleasure of them exploding in your mouth. However, for this dish to be a success, the meat MUST be cooked beautifully. Don't let the sauce be the focus of the meal.

I loved the sauce. By the time we were ready to eat, the sauce was almost gone! I used roma tomatos, shallot white wine vinegar, and fresh jalopeno which had turned red. This last provided a richer heat than flakes. YUM! This is terrific with pita bread, on sandwiches, and I'd say as a condiment to anything, tho I'd not want to eat this with pasta...it's too sweet.

This was OK. The meat cooked good, the sauce was OK.

The other reviewers' thoughts are pretty much right on the mark. I thought that this was an easy-to- make, colorful and tasty dish. I also agree with the reviewers who suggested a little more red pepper would be nice. My only disappointment, and maybe this was my fault in the preparation, was that I thought the sauce turned out more watery than I expected (but still excellent flavor).

What a find! Ths wonderful sauce deserves an individual listing, though, as it's so versatile. I've served it with pasta and fish, with great success. We served it recently at a dinner party, with BBQ'd tuna steaks, couscous and salad. Very easy, and attracted lots of compliments from people who appreciate good food. Vegetarians might find this great with dry dishes such as nut loaf or baked egg recipes. I live in Southern California, where cherry tomatoes are available year-round, but I'd imagine that any good-quality vine tomato would achieve very good results. Leftover sauce is great as a dressing for a couscous salad.

I followed this recipe to the letter. Fantastic! So easy, and I agree with the cook who said the timing works out nicely. The flavors of fresh parsley and garlic combined with the roasted tomatoes are divine, but it's really the way the sauce comes together with the meat that brings out the best in both. After serving this, one of my guests proclaimed it the best roast he's ever eaten, and asked if I'd ever considered becoming a chef. Don't change a thing!

Easily prepared and lovely color presentation with the sauce (I also added diced yellow sweet peppers for extra color/texture). Personally, found the sauce a little too garlicky for my taste but my husband loved it and it easily translates to other uses as leftovers. Used it as omlette fill the next morning.

Easily prepared dish and pretty presentation with the colors of the tomato and parsley (I also added diced yellow sweet bell peppers to the roasted tomato sauce for more color/texture interest). Personally, I found the sauce a little too garlicky for my liking though my husband really enjoyed it. Will likely make again as it is easy and leftover sauce easily translates to other uses (used for omlette fill the next morning).

This is a simple dish of clear flavors that depends on the quality of the ingredients and the care you put into the straightforward preparation. A few recommendations: A 10" skillet may not be large enough to hold the tri-tip comfortably (my 14" cast-iron skillet was just right). Also, season the roast with salt, pepper, and oregano (e.g.) and let it sit 12-24 hours loosely wrapped in the refrigerator -- remove the meat about an hour before cooking. Starting with a room-temperature tri-tip, my oven needed only 15 minutes to produce a beautiful medium-rare roast. Finally, the parsley/garlic/olive oil sauce, which I prepared by hand to get an interesting texture, reminded me of a pesto, so I threw in some good Parmesan before mixing with the hot tomatoes (cherry and cut-up heirlooms) -- delicious. I'm planning to add a little of the sauce to my omelet tomorrow morning; putting it on pasta or stirring a big spoonful through an appropriate risotto also sound appealing.

We've made this dish twice--it is very tasty and simple to make! Perfect dish for a dinner party since the sauce can be made ahead of time, and you can entertain your guests while the tri-tip roasts (rather than having to slave away in the kitchen). For the roasted tomato sauce I added extra red pepper flakes (we like it spicy!), and substituted cilantro for parsley to give the sauce a richer flavor. Try this recipe...you won't be disappointed!

This was delicious, and a nice combination of good-old-American favorite roasted beef with a fresh and Latin-style sauce. I didn't have cherry tomatoes, and used a diced heirloom tomato, with great success. The cut of meat is flavorful like a steak, but slices and is closer to the formality of a roast beef.

An excellent and clever dish. The sauce is like a chimichurri loaded with juicy cherry tomatoes, and the timing of the different elements works really well, which isn't always the case with these "quick" recipes.

I'm always apprehensive about cooking different cuts of beef that I'm not too familar with but this was excellent! And the sauce was the perfect accompaniment.
