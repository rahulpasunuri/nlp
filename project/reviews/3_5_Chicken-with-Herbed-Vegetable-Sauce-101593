The amount of veggies in this is great. The chicken was juicy and tender. The flavor, however, was lacking. I will definitely make this again, but I'll add extra seasonings.

This recipe was really good! My husband has to eat heart healthy and hes not super crazy about veggies but he loved this. I thought the sauce would be a little bland but it was actually really tasty

This was great. I used farmers' market veggies and the sauce came out with a nice sweetness. I did use some red pepper flakes, perhaps a little too much. I also had some oregano that I threw in with the thyme. My basil was a bit wilted so I threw it in at that stage too. The sauce was incredibly flavorful in the end. Everything blended really well together. Finally, I wanted to spoon the sauce over some carbs (so I could eat more of it:) and used brown rice. Not such a good idea asthe rice absorbed all of the deliciousness of the sauce and just came out clumpy and bland. Next time, I'll use a lighter carb like cous cous or angel hair pasta. Either way, the recipe itself was awesome and I will definitely make it again.

This was a good recipe but maybe it will taste better and have more flavor for second day leftovers.

I thought this recipe was wonderful... I think that next time I may serve it over a bed of rice or perhaps add some steamed veggies.

Though this recipe has some of my favorite ingredients, I found the result to be a bland waste of chopping time. I wouldn't even consider trying it again with alterations/improvements. It's just that boring.

I really liked the taste of this dish and I think it is a great way to make people eat vegetables! It is also quick to prepare.

This was a refreshing and tasty dish. A nice way to combine chicken and veggies outside of a stirfry. It was not wow, but it was good enough for me to consider making again.

My husband, who is not a fan of vegetables, loved this dish. I served it over rice--another food he doesn't care for--and he cleaned his plate. Something he doesn't usually do. Another suggestion: If you make it less brothy and omit the chicken, it makes a nice sauce for pasta.

Didn't really like. The sauce was okay, but the texture of the chicken was a bit rubbery.

This dish was fine for a week-end night. Took a good hour start-to-finish. Definitely double some of the vegetables for a side dish - there is quite a bit of broth. Add four times the amount of carrot if you are making this for children as well! Works well with boiled new potatoes as a side.

This was a very good weeknight dish and could even be used for a easy dinner for guests. The vegetable did take some time to cut up, next time I will use a mandoline...you can also just chop up the veggies and cook for longer. I doubled the amount of vegetable for chicken which made it enough for a side dish. Definetely use the cherry tomatoes, I think regular tomatoes would overpower the dish. The sauce did not reduce the way I would have liked, I will probably use less broth next time.

Simple to make, outstanding flavor. Recommend brining chicken for 1 hour before cooking in 1/4 cup kosher salt and water. Greatly enhances the flavors.

Delicious! True, there is a lot of prep involved in slicing all of the vegetables, but it's worth the effort for such a healthy and tasty dish. I added some red bell pepper to the vegetable mixture for added color and flavor, and I used Swanson's roasted garlic chicken broth. That plus the herbs made a delicious sauce.

I loved the herbed broth that this renders. The vegetables cooked down and absorbed the broth so nicely.

Fantastic dish, which was very easy to make! I chose to slice the vegetables rather than julienne them and saved a considerable amount of prep time! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used four cloves of garlic and vine ripened cherry tomatoes. YUM!

This is delicious..... In fact we enjoyed this so much I made the veggie part only, however, it was better with the flavor of the chicken. I'm not too fond of cherry tomatoes so I used vine ripened toms, peeled and seeded, and as another cook did I added white wine. YUM

It was OK, but not worth the time, which was considerably more than 45 minutes

All in all it was pretty tasty. The vegetables take a LONG time to prepare, about 30-40 min. I used 12 oz. of skinned, diced roma tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes and it was great. I also added butter and white wine to the sauce to make it extra "saucy". The sauce didn't thicken the way I thought it should but tasted good, nevertheless. Next time I will omit the celery and add an extra garlic clove.

This recipe came out quite tasty. The only problem is that preparing the vegetables is time consuming; it took far longer to julienne the vegetables than it did to actually cook! Having a mandoline would probably speed things up quite a bit. To speed up the cooking time, try using cut up chicken breasts instead of whole.

Excellent dish. It made a nice sauce full of vegetables and flavor. I added some fresh lemon juice for some extra zip. Great without the chicken too for a vegetarian meal.

What I did was saute the chicken to a nice brown, but not too brown. Then put the chicken on a pan an place in the oven on 350 F for 5-10 min. While the chicken was in the oven sweeted off the veggies and about 3 Tbsp. garlic with the chicken fat add a little brandy and reduced down to allset. Then i slowly incorperated manufatured cream and hole butter to make a nice sauce. When chicken was done. I plated and spooned sauce and arrange veggies on plate to serve.

A very good and easy dinner. I wouldn't make any changes for next time.

This one's a keeper. My grocer didn't have zucchini so I used yellow squash. I kicked it up a notch by putting in some white wine, and a little butter at the end. Great dish!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used kosher salt with coarse pepper to coat the chicken which made it spicey. I also increased the amount of broth to approximately 1 and 1/2 cups and let it reduce which made for a nice rich sauce. Great for leftovers the next day.
