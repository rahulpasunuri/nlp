My first time making Creme Anglaise - it was very easy! I halved it with no problem. We did eat it right away, so I don't know how it holds up if made ahead of time. I added some vanilla bean because I thought it might be bland if I didn't; I used this as a sauce for the Grand Marnier souffles.

Excellent, easy and so good! Did not make any changes to the recipe. I made it the day before and chilled it. I used the creme anglaise in the Grand Marnier souffles. Outstanding!

Thing is, you add the corn starch so that the custard doesn't curdle. If you don't boil the custard for a good two minutes, you end up with a chalky crème anglaise. Also, if you do this a day ahead of time, cool the custard and look at it the next day I can bet you that you're once thick custard is now soup: heating the corn starch to the boiling point and keeping it there for two minutes kills an enzyme in the starch that otherwise turns the custard to soup. Try the crème anglaise recipe without the corn starch. It's not that difficult, and if you're just a little mindful you'll end up with a beautiful and silky custard sauce.

I made this to accompany Grand Marnier Souffles (also an excellent epicurious recipe. The creme anglaise was very easy to make and came out perfect. Highly recommended.

Great recipe- quick and simple! I made it with chocolate souffle for a dinner party, and it came out perfectly!

This was very easy and turned out really delicious. It wasn't too sweet, which was a huge pro, and it also didn't use that many egg yolks (some recipes call for 6!!!), which made it healthier than other recipes. =) I added 3/4 tablespoon of vanilla bean paste, and used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of 2% milk instead since I didn't have half-and-half on hand.

Delicious! Unlike most recipes for Creme Anglaise, this was not too sweet. Agreed that Vanilla or other flavoring is a must. Also, cooking to 180 degrees produces a true sauce (which thickens somewhat as it cools and is nice with souffles, cakes, etc.) -- cook longer if you are looking for a thicker custard.

I used vanilla infused sugar then added a dash of sea salt because it tasted a tad bland. Otherwise, a simple and practically fool-proof recipe.

This was almost a disaster - the custard just wouldn't thicken. I made a double recipe (4 egg yolks). So i just beat another yolk with some sugar and a little more cornstarch, and whisked the hot "custard" back into it and then returned the whole mess to the pot and heated one more time. This time it turned out just as it should have. Oh, and I heated a halved vanilla bean in the cream to add flavor. served it under gingerbread, dotted with raspberry sauce for Christmas eve, and everyone was impressed...

Everyone loved this recipe! I served it as a base for the Molten Chocolate Cake on this website. I did not make the mint sauce that accompanied the recipe. I sprinkled some fresh raspberries on the plate as an added garnish. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Delicious! I made this to accompany the French Apple-Almont Tart... just put a little dallop on each plate - perfect!! One of the best anglaise I have made, really easy and so so good!! I didn't think it needed anything else added to it!

this was great, but not very sweet or flavorful. I added a little vanilla and it was persfect. I served it with peach dumplings. Superb combination.

Simple to make and a lovely consistency. I covered the top with plastic to keep skin from forming. I agree that the addition of vanilla or some other flavoring would jazz this up.

Simply sublime!

A great sauce! I add vanilla and a little extra sugar, and grand marnier when using with the souffles. This is also great served under a slice of cake for that gourmet touch of elegance.

I love the story about master chef, James Beard, told by his associate Marion Cunningham (she writes for the LA Times). Beard had just completed a superb Creme Anglaise but the dish was accidentally dropped and was unusable. There was no time to make another batch. So Beard bought premium vanilla ice cream, melted it, and served it as Creme Anglaise. I'll bet it was delicious, too.

What a wonderful way to feel like a decadent eater outer at home!! So yummy with bread pudding it makes my toes curl just thinking about it. This is one recipe you can keep in your recipe file forever and pull out when an accompaniment is needed.

I served this sauce chilled with chocolate bread pudding. I did add 1 t. vanilla and it was delicious. It would also be delicious served warm with the Grand Marnier souffles.

I added a vanilla bean to the creams while they heated & got wonderful results

Excelent results. The cooking time to thicken was about 10 minutes instead of the recomended 2 and the addition of 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract gave a much more rounded flavor. If your a fan of rich dessert sauces this would be well worth the small effort it takes to make this one!!

This was much easier to prepare than I anticipated. I served the creme in chocolate cups with fresh raspberries. Fantastic!
