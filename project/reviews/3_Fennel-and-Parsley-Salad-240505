Easy to make. You really do need a mandolin since paper thin slices of the fennel are essential. Light, simple and delicious.

You really have to like fennel and parsley. I like fennel,but would pair this wih something other than parsley. The slice fennel is also difficult to eat, although the salad is pretty, I would recommend cutting the fennel differently.

I liked this as it was very easy. Raw fennel is so fresh and crisp, it is nice to make it so simple and tasty.
