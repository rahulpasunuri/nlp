There is never a good reason to not be nice to people.

This recipe is a great reminder that sometimes the best accompaniment to a strong main dish is an unassuming side dish like this. I made orange braised chicken with green olives and saffron rice when I used this recipe. Because my other dishes were so strongly flavored, I needed a simple salad to provide variety of texture without competing flavor. This did the trick. Those who gave negative reviews should leave the sarcasm out of their "recipe" the next time.

Things were simpler back in 1996.....Back when gas cost about 85 cents a gallon.....

bout as basic as it gets use good olive oil and what ever vinger turns you on add what ever. onions, cheese, beets work, it is a base you build on it.

I haven't tried this recipe yet because it sounds so complicated! I'm confused...do you slice the cucumber first and then peel it? And do I ruin the dish if I go cucumber, tomato, cucumber, tomato, etc? What if I put the pepper in BEFORE the salt? Inquiring cooks want to know!

I found this recipe very funny, so I made it for kicks. Actually pretty good base recipe. Add your own variations. I used balsamic, olive oil, basil, chives and parsley (surplus in the garden). Use Jersey tomatoes in season. The best.

Just adding Black Pepper is not enough to make this tasty...but if you use a little light champagne dressing and toss it is a very light and low-cal side that is great for spring and summer..

Well, your guests certainly won't be racking their brains trying to figure out the secret ingredient. This recipe had to be "invented" by the rocket scientist who invented the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar recipe. (If you want the recipe, I just gave it to you.) As in the other "recipe" they tell you to use salt and pepper and only list the pepper as an ingredient. What's next - a "recipe" for Cheerios and milk?!

Sarcasm, folks. Most of the previous reviewers were mocking the "recipe," and I don't blame them. It's an utterly silly thing to have a recipe for.

I don't understand why this recipe has received so many negative reviews. I guess none of you so called "cooks" know how to follow a recipe. It goes: tomatoes, cucumber, tomato, cucumber, tomato, cucumber... Get it right and then pass your useless comments.

I drizzled some olive oil over the veggies and it was very good. I don't understand why so many people had trouble with the recipe. I found it very simple and easy to follow.

I found this recipe extremely confusing. How do I tell if the tomatos are vine ripened? What size plate should I use. As a variation, I chopped the tomatoes instead of slicing...I think this was my mistake.

45 Minutes?! Good God, how the heck could you get it done that quickly?!

Wait, it says to add salt, but salt isn't in the list of ingredients! What do I do now?! Oh my God, dinner's ruined!

The recipe was waaay too complicated. I got very confused and had to abandon the kitchen half-way through. It was devestating. I may never cook again.

I can't believe there's actually a recipe for this. What's next, ice cubes?
