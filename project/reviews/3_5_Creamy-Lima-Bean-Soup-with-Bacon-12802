Bland as is. Used dried limas with fresh ones as a garnish, onions, a ham hock instead of bacon, celery, cracked black pepper and fresh thyme. I tossed in some sliced carrots and used chardonnay with chicken stock. Now THAT's a lima bean soup.

Bleh. I guess maybe my family likes a kick to their meals, but this was a bland soup, even after a ton of doctoring. In the end, not only did I salt and pepper, but I added parm. cheese, horseradish, and finally Texas Pete tobasco sauce out of desperation. The end result tasted like split pea soup, which doesn't involve me standing in front of the fridge wondering what the heck to add to make it fit to eat.

This recipe is insanely good - and this is coming from someone who is on the fence about lima beans. I added two large dollops of Greek (Fage) yogurt as another reviewer suggested. Otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe said. (Except I used a little more bacon than it called for.) I made the soup and the bacon ahead of time just heated it up when it was time to eat. It was a HUGE hit. My husband is upset that there are no leftovers :( We'll be having this again very soon.

Wow - this was great. I had fresh lima beans from the CSA. I added just a splash of wine to the broth mixture. Was an outstanding and easy soup.

...the basis of a good recipe ...double the bacon, experiment with spice, consider dairy, perhaps sour cream, yogurt or cheese ...

I tried the variation offered by the cook from Houston (8 slices bacon and 1/8 tsp. fennel seed) and liked it - though I added about 5 slices of bacon and the fennel to the soup before blending it. As I heated it up after pureeing, I added a dollop of plain yogurt to smooth out the consistency.

I had the best of intentions to make this soup as is, but I used what I had on hand. Frozen broccoli for limas, beef stock instead of chicken broth. Then, I decided I wanted it creamy, added some milk, used up the last of some smoked cheddar cheese for garnish. This is a great recipe to use as a base!

I made this soup once and I thought it was great; immensely satisfying. I substituted turley bacon for regular bacon. I thought it was easy ad particularly like that there are on;y a few ingredients.

Although the recipe tasted good on the second try I added 8 strips of bacon and 1/8 tsp fennel seed. This is my own idea but you might consider it.

The soup was tasty but I think a little fine tuning is in order. I'm sure that after a few attempts it will be perfect.
