Sort of blah. There are better spicy nuts out there. Including a recipe from Bon Appetit from years ago that doesn't seem to be on this site. Happy I kept it!

Made these for Easter party. Did not have tomato based chili sauce so substituted catsup. They were delicious, buttery crisp, not too spicy and leftovers have been good for snacks and salads. Will make again
