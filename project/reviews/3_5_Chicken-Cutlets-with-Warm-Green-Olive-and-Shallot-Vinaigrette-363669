Could only give this one fork as that is the rating for 'okay.' I will never make this again. The 'vinaigrette' was more like a salsa, very chunky and very little sauce. I agree with previous reviewers who felt that the 'sauce' was boring. (Only deviation that I made from recipe was to chop the olives instead of halving them.) IF I were to do this again, I would add broth and wine to make an actual sauce. Husband and two teenagers were not fans either.

Great flavors (kind of a "taste of Moroccan"). I think the 2 T of olive oil in the end was too much and not necessary. Will cut down just a bit. It's not really a vinaigrette per se but a flavorful garnish/topping for the cutlet. "Cutlets" are labeled as such on many brands of chicken and are very thin. Increase the amount of zest (no white stuff!) to further brighten the flavor. Radicchio leaves completely unnecessary for serving. Nothing, spinach, whatever would be fine. Serve it with a rice recipe that also has raisins or fruit and nuts to further up the "exotic" factor. So quick and easy, will totally make again.

This was a very pretty presentation, but the flavor does not come through very well. I would add more olives and dice them to get more flavor out of them. Also it is unclear exactly what chicken "cutlets" are--skinless boneless breast which is sliced thin? or Full thickness? This would make a difference in how long to cook them on a side "to doneness". I will definitely make this again!

This was a delicious sauce/topping and the raddichio made a nice presentation. I think it could be used to dress up many things besides chicken; I think it would be good on some pan sauteed fish too.

Will leave out the radicchio next time, flavor just doesn't seem to go well with the rest of the ingredients somewhat over powering

I am always on the lookout for weeknight dinners that are fairly quick and interesting but on the healthier side. This fits the bill. It was quick, very tasty and, if you're okay with sodium, it is a good pick. Served with wild rice and salad. My family of adults enjoyed tonight's dinner so it will make it to the menu mix.

Really enjoyed this. Make sure to use thinner (or pounded) cutlets. I used breasts which were took thick and took too long to cook through.

I think I've made this recipe at least 4 times already. It's quick, easy, visually appealing, and tasty. A slight variation I make is to nestle some mache lettuce in the radicchio leaves and then top with the the chicken and sauce.

This was just ok. I actually found that the lemon peel, shallot, and olive combination left a bitter after taste. I was surprised that my 'sauce' turned out to be a lot less sauce-like so it was a little difficult to get a forkful of the sauce with every bite of chicken.

Delicious. Simple but elegant. Next time I'll make a bit more of the sauce.

This is really fantastic. Unlike the previous reviews, made exactly as written. The olives and raisins definitely "make" the sauce; the flavor combinations are excellent. Served with rice pilaf and a green salad.

LOL Cook from Beverly Hills!!! I hear you - far too many times recipes are rated and reviewed when the original recipe wasn't even prepared. Glad to hear that your 'pumpkin pie' was four fork worthy :)....

Wow, mouthwatering would be an understatement. Up early one Saturday morning I decided to fix this recipe for an early dinner. Unfortunately I was out of chicken breast so I used a fresh, whole pumpkin. The brightness of its flesh was brilliant and dazzled the eyes. I looked for my last bit of shallots but realized they were all used for a BBQ I had the previous week; no problem, I used a pie crust instead. Garlic gone, green olives depleted from a night of drinking dirty martinis and raisins stale, I just substituted sugar, cinnamon and cloves. I knew when I looked for the missing lemon that this was going to be a long day. Using my mad skills as a chef however, I just brought out eggs, salt, ginger and evaporated milk. Knowing I would never find raddichio leaves in the middle of winter, I settled for heavy whipping cream. Putting all of these ingredients together in a 9 inch tin and smothering the top with heavy cream made for the best chicken cutlets I have EVER experienced!

The vinaigrette is a wonderful combination of sweet and salty! I used gorgonzola stuffed green olives and thin pork chops instead of the chicken cutlets. This is a definite keeper.

Very good. I would delete the olives next time (too salty and not necessary for the flavoring). I used a regular balsamic vinegar as I did not have any white balsamic and wouldn't hesitate to use it again. I did not have any radicchio leaves and served it with spinach.
