needed more than 6 miniutes per side to ensure pork properly cooked and make at least twice the amount of marinade. That said, the final product was excellent and the left overs, cold the next day, were just as good.

Do not be put off by the nuc mam -- it blends in with the other ingredients. I chose this recipe because of its short marinade time. After only 2.5 hrs. the meat had taken on a good rich taste. I used rib loin center cuts, about 3/4 " thick, rather than a tenderloin. I do not think this recipe as it stands would be sufficient for a tenderloin -- I would at the very least double it. Next time I may try this as a satay and serve it with a dipping sauce.

This one's pretty bad and not worth the effort. I found the meat had no interesting flavour even after being marinated for a day. I prefer something with more sauce.

You are not boiling the marinade to reduce it, you are boiling it to kill off any bacteria that is in it as a result of its contact with the raw meat. You only need to boil it for a couple of minutes to make it safe for consumption.

This tasted good, but the recipe makes no sense. How do you "boil down" a marinade that has only 3 Tbsp of liquid? I cooked it, then moistened it. I just think this needs a little more work.

An excellent recipe. The nuoc cham doesn't quite taste like the kind I've gotten at Vietnamese restaurants, but it was a very good marinade. Perhaps I'll add more sugar next time. I used boneless pork chops, marinaded for just about an hour, cooked them in my grill pan and I was very satisfied with the results.
