Fantastic. I omitted the sugar..I tasted a raw kernal from the end and decided it was sweet enough. Only way to make corn on the grill...love the cilantro and lime..cant wait to make it again.

Friends were mad for the cilantro butter! Next time I will grill in the inner layer of husk, gets some good char but stays more moist.

I tried this recipe for the first time 2 weeks ago (6/2010) i only told 2 of the ladies what i had prepared, didnt tell any other guest. i had 6-7 request for the recipe after dinner. The guys LOVED this recipe. i was thrilled. i shucked my corn, broke in halves, prepared dble recipe of butter, didnt add the sugar.. and applied 3 Tbl spoons melted butter to each half corn. wrapped in HD tin foil and grilled only 15 minutes total. Crisp and Delicious.... will be making this alllllll summer...thanks

We made this last night and it was excellent. The lime flavoring just made the grilled corn "pop". We served it with the crab tostada recipe (which was just slightly better than ok) and THIS recipe was the winner!

I make the lime cilantro butter often and serve it on top of salmon, vegetables other than corn. Sometimes a touch of garlic helps depending on the vegetable.

I have been making this recipe for the last 3 years. It is delicious however, I don't add the sugar (summer corn is already very sweet) and I brush the butter directly onto the corn during the last 3 minutes. (P.S. the corn is supposed to be shucked)

Not sure if grilling made such a difference since the husks prevent the corn from charring, but the compound butter was delish!
