Yum. Croutons made with bacon fat? Yes, please. I did skip the ranch dressing because I thought it might overpower the flavor of my homegrown tomatoes. And I didn't have slab bacon -- that would have been even better.

I thought this was a good recipe but it didn't deserve raves. A great salad for a crowd on a buffet. I used spring mix for the arugula and frisee. The dressing needs some spice - maybe cayenne pepper.

This salad is a huge hit during football season. It is quick and amazing. Definitely not healthy but will please the crowds.

This was delicious. I was skeptical about the croutons but pleasantly surprised that they turned out excellent. I'll make it again because it is so easy and fast.

This is heaven on a plate. Such a good go to recipe. I don't care for their prep of the bread, so I just broil it in the oven with some butter and herbs. And I add just a touch of buttermilk ranch dressing on the side.
