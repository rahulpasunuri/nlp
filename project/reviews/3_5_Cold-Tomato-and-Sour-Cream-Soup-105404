I made it the day before I planned on eating it...I think letting the ingredients come together overnight made a difference. The soup is wonderfully refreshing on a hot day!

This is a wonderful fresh-tasting soup. Made it with four different kinds of tomatoes fresh from my garden, so the colour was a nice pale peach. Also added a clove of garlic & fresh garlic chives.This added a nice little bite to it.

Great way to use those wonderful summer tomatoes! I stirred in most of the sour cream and topped the soup with small dollops of sour cream. Delicious first course/side dish for a hot summer day.

There is no need to peel the tomatoes as the skins can be sieved out with the seeds. This soup goes to four forks when made using roasted tomatoes and fresh herbs, but it is light and flavorful as written.

Delicious! The soup tasted best when chilled over night. In addition to the sour cream I garnished the soup with avocado slices -- yum!

This is a great recipe. I didn't use the sour cream, and substituted drived savroy for the marjoram. I make it with home grown tomatoes. its great.

Very nice - light and flavourful. I was a bit surprised to see dried herbs in this recipe - I used fresh basil in the soup and a basil chiffonade to garnish. A couple of nice variants: lime juice and zest instead of lemon, with cilantro for the herb, and yogurt instead of sour cream; or orange zest and juice (double amount of juice), omitting the herbs - slightly unusual but good.

I seeded the tomatoes while I was peeling and quartering them and skipped the sieve part. Next time I will use half the salt and whisk in most of the sour cream before serving for a creamier appearance. This is a great starter for a warm summer night's meal and my tomato-shy hubby said he "didn't hate it".

This cold soup was absolutely a beautiful presentation. Perfect first course. Because it is chilled - make it the day before your party. Excellent taste. Possibly add 1 leaf chopped cilantro and garnish with cilantro for a twist.

We made this with yellow heirlooms. We mixed most of the sour cream into the soup before serving, saving just a spoonful for the garnish. The color was spectacular, especially in the turquoise bowls we used. The taste was as light, delicate, and refreshing as anything you'd want during high tomato season.

This is a very good use for an overabundance of tomatoes. Next time I would go easy on the lemon juice/zest.

We thought this was a terrifc use for the summer's garden tomatoes. We used light sour cream and less of it; otherwise not much difference. As a first course, it's a great way to fill up before hitting the higher calorie part of dinner. I think the tomato quality is the key. I wouldn't bother with supermarket tomatoes or even what passes here as a farmer's market.

For half of the tomatoes, I used sweet yellow tomatoes, all 4 Tbsp. of lemon juice to offset it, and it was a big hit-even with the kids. Very light and refreshing. (Note to a cook reviewing on 8/15-I rarely have success cooking things I hate, even if the rest of the family is prepared to like the dish-it's hard to achieve something delicious if you don't know what you're shooting for i.e. it's all going to taste bad to you, whether it does or not)

A little bland. Just before serving, I added a bit of chopped cherry tomato for texture and a bit of jalapeno (canned) pepper. If I had a lot of garden tomatoes to get rid of, I'd make it again. Otherwise it's not worth the bother.

In this hot weather the tomatoes come on fast so I can always use another tomato recipe. This soup is also good using frozen tomatoes. I partially thaw them and drain off most of the water then proceed with the recipe. Delicious.

I am the only one who hates tomatos in my family and my family hated it too

Very refreshing! My mother hates gazpacho, but loves this. It would make a great first course.
