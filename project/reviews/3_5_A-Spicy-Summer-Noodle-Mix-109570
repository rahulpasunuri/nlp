Really liked the cucumbers in this diah. It was nice with a little spice and the cool noodles. My husband used the left overs by placing them over a green salad and thought it was dressed nicely that way.

Simple and VERY good. No need for ice either, just noodles and delicious sauce. Don't use soft packaged "Chinese noodles" from the refrigerated shelves in the market; they're gummy and gross.

Do you have to like kimchi to like this dish? I want to make it for a potluck but am worried that people who are not familiar with kimchi would think the flavors and smell of kimchi would be overpowering.

I've made this recipe many, many times with many different types of noodles, and have been happy with the results with all of them. It's pretty versatile--I've even made it warm and with rice. It's become one of my favorite Korean recipes--it's fast and delicious!

I've used the Korean cucumbers in the recipe, seedless cucumbers and regular cucumbers. As long as you remove the seeds, any kind is fine. Opted out on the crushed ice, but I leave a few hours to chill thoroughly. Great recipe that I've made many times.

This takes about a second and is fabulous. Didn't do the ice thing; it was more like a big delicious cold pasta.

Oh, I used crushed ice for presentation and it came out beautifully. But since it was a pain in the butt to chop the ice, I will probably just use ice cubes next time :)

I boiled some Japanese Barley to make the cold tea (Mugicha) and it was totally fine. I thought this recipe needed way more flavor so I added 2 tablespoons of kochujang, more soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil and vinegar to taste. With those extra ingredients it came out fabulous. Also, I think the serving size is more like it serves to six people, the portion was huge in my opinion and I had used 12 ounces of somen I had on hand instead of the 14 called for.

Somen noodles overcook quickly so be careful as I overcooked mine and they were soft. I made my own quick kimchee from a Tyler Florence recipe from FoodTV and that was delicious and you get to regulate the level of heat. I used the Korean cucumbers but did not really notice a difference. This was nice and spicy and if you cook the noodles properly would make a delicious salad.

If you like kimchi, this is a delicious dish. It's a great combo of salty, sweet and spicy.

The cucumber/kimchi mix was absolutely wonderful over soba noodles. Depending on how tart the kimchi is, you might want to go easy on, or even omit the vinegar from the dressing entirely. Definitely recommended for a hot summer afternoon!

I substituted Korean yam noodles which are translucent. Even the kids ate them.

Very very good. Served it with the Grilled Five Spice Chicken also from this site. Even the 9-year old loved it, kimche and all.
