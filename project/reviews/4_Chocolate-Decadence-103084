Excellent cake & very, very easy to make! I used mini semisweet morsels instead of chopping up the larger ones and they worked wonderfully and melted faster. I didn't make the raspberry sauce - we just used whipped cream with it. Everyone LOVED it!

YUM... This was so good. And really very easy to make. I used a regular pan, and it wasn't hard to get the cake to come out. Definitely make the raspberry sauce, it is the perfect complement.

I would NOT recommend using a springform pan. I tried that and wrapped it carefully in tinfoil as suggested, but water still seeped in and ruined the cake. The top part of the cake that cooked tasted great and so did the batter (I couldn't resist). I will try this recipe again - without the shortcut.

The dark chocolate made this recipe a little too bitter for me - I would substitute half milk chocolate next time - but the texture was absolutely divine

I made this when I first saw it in Gourmet six years ago. It is the best grown-up birthday cake, because it is so indulgent and rich, but looks so elegant and refined. No one ever guesses that it's only four ingredients and takes no time to make. Advice on getting it out of the pan: hold your cake over the flame/burner for just a few seconds at a time. Hold, then check to see if it will come out of the pan, then hold again. Keep repeating in very small intervals until it comes out. It sounds time-consuming, but is not. Using this process ensures that you'll get it out in one piece without burning it every time. Also, use the best chocolate you can find, and use good butter, too. With so few ingredients, it's crucial that they be good. And try to find free-range eggs. I like the raspberry sauce, but sometimes I either go without or just serve one from a jar, or just go with whipped cream only. But do try it -- it's wonderful!

We used to get a chocolate decadence dessert at Henry' End in Brooklyn Heights and one day they just stopped serving it. My husband was devastated and I looked everywhere for a recipe that would come close. We never found anything like it made anywhere else. This is the 2nd recipe I tried and he was like a little kid again. This recipe was "on the money". It lived up to an incredible expectation. Anyone who loves chocolate will love this!!

Rave reviews from everyone who tried it. "Awesome" and "Orgasmic Jubulation" were some of the comments. I used Lindt dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet. I made 1.5 times the recipe and cooked it in a 10 inch springform pan for 50 minutes. If you buy BBQ foil you do not have to use two sheets to wrap the springform pan and there are no leaks when you place it in the water bath.

Narsai M. David not only served this wonderful chocolate desert which I first had at his restaurant in Kensington,CA but also a wonderfully dense almond torte. I've been making both since I got the recipes from a friend of Mr. David. His restaurant was a serene gourmet dinning experience and Mr. David was a very cordial host. We enjoyed many wine tasting dinners at Narsai's in the 80's.

OH MY GOODNESS - CAN YOU SAY YUMMMMMMMM? My sister loves chocolate raspberry desserts so I came here a looking for one to make on her birthday. This fit the bill wonderfully. Best of all is was SOO easy, but came out so gourmet! We are on a tight budget and something like this would have cost a small fortune to buy. I think it cost me about 5 bucks to make and I even added a half recipe. (so I ended up with 1.5) I used chocolate chips for the semi-sweet chocolate and melted it with the butter in 30 second intervals in the microwave, stirring each time. I lined the bottom of a 12" springform pan with greased parchment and then wrapped the pan in 2 sheets of foil. Simple as that. I did choose to strain the raspberry puree which I feel makes it more professional. Everyone loved it. I mean EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!

My sister found this little gem many years ago and we've both made it more times than we can count. It always gets rave reviews and we hardly ever go home with any leftovers. Besides being delicious, it is so easy to make. It has a gourmet cake feel without all the hard work. I strain the raspberry sauce but my sister doesn't-just a preference- either way it is delicious. I always get requests for the recipe so now I take a few copies with me to the party. I highly recommend this cake, especially if you love chocolate. To answer a few questions from other reviewers, yes you can use an 8" or 9" spring form pan-it just comes out a little flatter in the larger pan. To keep water from getting into the pan you can wrap it with two pieces of foil. Make sure the pieces are perpendicular to each other and that they go all the way up the sides. Enjoy!

Oh Baby Yes!!!! Although I am not normally a chocolate fan, everyone at my son's birthday table including him (he is 11) LOVED this stuff! You can only eat it in small amounts...but oh...every bite counts!

I haven't made it yet but wonder why I couldn't use a 9" springform pan. Any comments from someone who's made it?

Here is a TIP on getting CAKE OUT OF PAN: I used 3 strips of waxed paper about 2 inches wide each, long enough to pass from one side of the pan, underneath the cake and up the other side. Make sure they are placed *underneath* the paper bottom, in a star-form, pressed against the pan. So, when I wanted to remove the cake, I grabbed the strips on each side and loosened the cake, from the bottom. Then I flipped it over onto a rack. I had no problems making this, although I would not recommend using a spring-form pan- seems like the water might seep through to the cake.

Can I say an orgasmic chocolate experience? I have had this in restaurants time and time again, but now I can make this EASY fabulous cake at home! I would also serve this with coconut or hazlenut ice cream with chocolate sauce drizzled around edge of the plate for garnish.

I totally looooooooooooooooove this cake. I pour ganache on top (talk about rich!). I have also made variations of it by adding hazelnuts on one, on another I used coffee and kahlua. I have to say, IT IS ALWAYS GOOD!

This is a recipe that you can use to really impress chocolate lovers. For those who had trouble, my guess is that not everyone has the acumen to compose such a culinary delight. I've never had a problem with this cake. However, maybe it's not for the novice cook. Some of the concepts (beating eggs till ribbons,hot water bath, greasing pan/ round of wax paper/greasing-flouring wax paper, heating pan on burner to realease) might be beyond the abiltity of some. If you read the reviews most rave. Don't let a few bad apples turn you away from this recipe. It's a classic, but perhaps only for the wise and not the novice cook.

Nowhere near as good as the decadence recipe that was on this site before the current version, and very, very difficult to remove from pan/keep from deflating/keep in one piece. This recipe came out as pudding in what can best be described as a crouton shell. Awful. There was another version available on this site prior to this that was marvelous, and came out correctly every time which only baked for 15 minutes, had 1 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp sugar and called for parchment (much easier to remove that way). The sauce was also much, much, much better: 2 1/2 cups thawed unsweet raspberries 1/2 cup superfine sugar 1/4 cup framboise (or Chambord) Puree and sieve. That full recipe is still available at: http://www.travelguides.com/bandb/recipes/printable_recipe.php?recipe=ds437

Whenever I need a really rich dessert to wow dinner guests, I turn to this one. It's delicious, and nobody needs to know how easy it is to make. (Except for the time it takes to chill, it's probably faster than a nasty box recipe.) I make it a day ahead to save time, which gives it just the right amount of time to set. For an added touch, I place a stencil on top and sift powdered sugar onto it, and add a few mint leaves. Simply gorgeous presentation. The raspberry sauce really does cut the sweetness well.

Our niece Ann, who lives in Dallas, alerted us to this recipe. My husband, who is the chocoholic in the family, made it for company. It is absolutely fabulous. Because it is so rich, it actually serves 16 people - and the best part is that it is still good a week later if there is any left! Now we make it a day or two earlier as suggested in the recipe. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this recipe twice, and both times it got rave reviews. It's my family's favorite dessert. I used a springform pan and had no trouble taking it out of the pan. I can't wait to make it again. It's EXCELLENT!!!

I made this for Valentine's Day and used heartshape cookie cutters for individual pieces and sprinkled confectioners' sugar for an added touch along w/the rasp puree and whipped cream. My husband raved about it and one son couldn't seem to get enough while the other totally hated it. It is very rich and just melts in your mouth and wasn't difficult to make.

Make no mistake, this is harder than the recipe makes it sound. You've got to be really careful with the chocolate temperature (not too hot -- if you're using a water bath, it should be _just barely_ boiling), or the end result will have a consistency similar to asphalt. In order to avoid burning the chocolate while it melts, it helps to cut up the chocolate and butter into fairly small pieces before they go on the heat -- I've never tried grating the chocolate and heating it with pre-melted butter, but I bet this would work well.

Not so easy..I made it twice and both times it had too many air bubbles, the chocolate flavor is excellent, but the top felt apart twice.

This was absolutely delicious! However, I need to do a little experimenting on removing it from the pan - it stuck to the waxed paper - I used a springform pan so there was no problem with the sides. The "up" side is that you can cover up the mistake with the raspberries and whipped cream.

This is SCRUMPTIOUS. So easy to make! Although it is incredibly rich, all chocoholics at the party LOVED this recipe!

I doubled the recipe, one for the Church Christmas Party and one for me. It is very rich, which is the only way I like chocolate. It needs the rasperberry puree and whip cream to round it off. Otherwise people think it is fudge. I finished the last piece off 3 hours ago and am thinking of making more tomorrow.

I first made this recipe for a seder I attended, because I needed a flour-less dessert and I'm not fond of the traditional macaroons. It was easy enough to prepare and I must say, if any of the other women at the table could have moved following the feast, I surely would have gotten a standing ovation!

TO DIE FOR one person I served this to said they usually don't like sweets but this is good, special!!! and I like the fact that it has only a few ingrediants, it makes it easy shopping and less complicated

This was easy and delicious especially for those who love chocolate. The whipped cream is a must to balance out the sweetness. I am making it again, this time for Passover.

This cake was superb for chocolate lovers. However, it is very rich and intense-really a torte and not a cake as there is no flour. The raspberry and whipped cream are a must. It is a snap to make.
