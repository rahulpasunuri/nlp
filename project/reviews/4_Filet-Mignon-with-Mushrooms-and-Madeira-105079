Excellent and easy. Make sure to buy the best quality meat, that's what makes this recipe. I agree with another reviewer that you can skip the pan and grill the steaks. Less messy, and the smoky flavor is great.

Absolutely incredible! Everything about this was perfect. Would make it again in a heartbeat. Made this for my husband on our anniversary - he was very impressed.

OH MY GOD! This steak and the sauce is HEAVEN. I made a large portobello mushroom instead of small ones. Used only one shallot and a random cabernet, and it was still amazing. You won't believe this but I am not a steak or beef person - I avoid it. And this makes me want to completely re-evaluate my priorities. This steak is major. Bravo!

This was delicious! A "10" according to my husband. I put the meat in the oven at 350 at the end instead of reheating on the skillet. Perhaps my cuts of meat were thicker than others. Otherwise, perfect!

Loved it - I cooked the madeira sauce a little too long but still fabulous. Buy quality madeira as it makes a difference.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday a month ago, and I loved it so much that I just made it again last night for my parents! The mushrooms and thyme give it a beautiful earthy flavor and it also brings out the richness of the steak. This has definitely become one of my favorites.

Wonderful!! Altho I grilled the filets, I just continued the recipe and ensured I used a good organic beef broth. Got lots of rave reviews. Its a keeper.

This turned out great, better than other madeira recipes we have tried. I did not have shallots so substituted red onion and it was fine. I also did not have any mushrooms so skipped that part. Next time I will be sure to add the mushrooms although it was really good without.

I made this for my wife's birthday, served with some white asparagus and a baked potato. She declared it one of the best dinners she's had. The sauce was fantastic, I substituted crimini mushrooms, because we love them. I'm sure this would be good with the steaks grilled as well, but I think that would detract from the sauce, and the Madeira wouldn't have enough to deglaze. I'll absolutely add this to the nice dinner rotation.

This recipe is fabulous! I have made it many times, sometimes with variations, and it is consistently great. Some of the substitutions that don't hurt are switching chicken stock for beef stock, switching Marsala for Madeira (my local store didn't have Madeira the first time so we mostly use Marsala), using onions in place of shallots, substituting dry for fresh thyme, etc. It really is scrumptious, even left over!

Rating: 4
And to add to my review below: Having cooked with Madeira before, I have a hunch the flavor of the sauce depends on the quality of Madeira you use. Your average supermarket brand might not cut it.

Rating: 4
My farmer-fiance was actually full enough from this meal that he saved some for lunch the next day-- apparently it was even better! The sauce was great over wild rice and we ate it with asparagus in horseradish butter, which lived up to the beef as a piquant side dish. I was a vegetarian for years and I'm still picky about the meat I eat, but I would definitely do this again, especially since it was relatively easy for such restaurant-quality results.

Outstanding dish! I've made this several times and the one change that I made was to double up on the mushrooms. The sauce is outstanding. I serve it with simple, steamed asparagus.

I read the other reviews, tasted the sauce at the end and I agree that it was not robust, so I added some blue cheese, which, yes, changed the receipe, but saved the dish. Hey, we're cooks here! It's not like baking, where it's too late once the dish is done. It makes a nice sauce with the blue, so would I make it again, yes, with the cheese.

This was good but not fabulous as I expected. I thought the sauce lacked flavor. I used less beef broth than called for and next time will even use less. I'm not sure how to flavor-it up since it already has great ingredients.

My hard to impress boyfriend loved this recipe, he'd give it 4 forks and I even did it 'on the cheap'! I didn't have any filet mignon but had some flank steak to use up. I followed the 'Pan Fried Beef Flank Ragout' recipe from this site to cook the beef and it was surprisingly tender. I had some fresh rosemary and chicken broth on hand so used those instead of the thyme and beef broth. Very tasty! I served with plain broccoli.

Rating: 4
Spectacular! The filet was tender and delicious. We typically grill our beef, but this recipe was wonderful. Great flavor and a perfectly prepared steak. I used port instead of madeira and it was perfect. Served it with a spinach salad and Cauliflower soup with pecorino (from this website). An aged french wine made the meal perfect.

Rating: 2
I made this recipe exactly as written except I used evaporated milk instead of the cream. The madeira wine is sweet and gives the dish a hint of sweetness which I didn't really care for. Next time I'd substitute just plain red wine. The evaporated milk worked just fine although the sauce was a bit on the thinner side.

amazing! made this for a farewell dinner for a friend and was perfect. of course depends on the quality of steak you get...having been in japan for 2 years and not eating thick, juicy steaks often, i went the extra mile and bought the nicest meat i could find, and it was well worth it. didn't have cream on hand so added milk and extra butter. mushrooms were so delicious and steaks quite rare but perfect. will make again, excellent way to prepare expensive, already delicious steaks!

The recipe I refered to below is called Madeira-Glazed Shallots. (If you type in Shallots in Madeira, you get a million recipes.) =:)

Rating: 4
Amazing dish! You really have to try this out next time you want to make a truly special dinner. I had no problem thickening the sauce (didn't have to add anything but the heavy cream). This recipe makes enough sauce for two good sized filets (not four). I would double it if I was to make four. Trust me, the sauce is so good, everyone at your table will want a good helping of it. If you want to use up the rest of the bottle of Madeira, try the shallots in Madeira (except make it with a touch of honey, not the 3TBS called for) and the Game Hens in Madeira Sauce (I made this sauce and just simmered some chicken breasts in it and it was great) Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This is the perfect dish for a special occasion. I recommend trying this recipe out!! It's better than the filets I've had in restaurants!! The asparagus with gargonzola butter (also on this site) is a great match if you're looking for a side dish to go with it.

Rating: 4
This was excellent! I didn't have Madeira, so I used a combination of about 1/4 cup Marsala and 1/4 cup of Port, and it turned out ok. I agree with one reviewer on the thickness of the sauce. I added about 1 tbsp flour mixed with 1 tbsp butter (roux) to thicken it at the end.

Where do I begin to rate this recipe? First off, I had never made filet mignon. It turned out to be an easy recipe to follow even though it's one of the more complex recipes I've made. I cooked this for my fiance and his comments were: "This is the best steak I've ever had--the flavor is amazing. This could have come from a restaurant." I highly recommend this recipe as a "wow-er" and will definitly make again!

This was the star of our Valentine's Day dinner and it was stupendous! I used to make this fairly frequently but haven't for quite some time; my husband is thrilled that I made again. I forgot to include the thyme and it was still fantastic. I served it with the Yellow Pepper Risotto from epicurious; a nice match, although the risotto is labor-intensive.

This is a great recipe. It's so simple it can be made on a week night, yet you would never know that it didn't take hours. I often make it for friends because there's no need to spend hours in the kitchen. Everyone raves about it and asks for the recipe.

Rating: 4
Delicious and simple. Not totally *wow*, but I'm still giving it a 4 because it's so simple. I used plain button mushrooms (I agree that the madiera sauce is flavorful enough to overwhelm fancier mushrooms). Sauce was definately thick enough. Just be sure to adequately reduce the liquids over fairly high heat, and don't skimp on the heavy cream (that's what thickens it).

Rating: 3
This was very tasty although you'll need to cut down on the amount of liquid (beef broth, especially) that goes into the sauce. The sauce was very thin. We eliminated most of the mushrooms and instead added tender asparagus tips at the end. Overall, a nice meal.

Like many others, I had no Madeira so used port in the sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe. It needs no changes.

Very tasty! Had no thyme, so substituted fresh rosemary and it came out beautifully. I recommend larger filets, especialy for those who want medium rare (sear longer to get the good char). For the medium-well lovers, you can simply cut the large filets crosswise, and serve as two medallions.

Rating: 4
Indeed, this is a very good recipe. Of course, if you're using the sauce to compliment an expensive cut of meat like a filet mignon or similar tenderloin cut, or even a choice New Y ork strip, you really shouldn't hold back. Use the butter for the mushroom saute and use the cream. It's decadent but that's sort of the point -- this is a special occassion dish. Oh, and button mushrooms are a bit out of place here. I would suggest a more exotic medley; the last time I made this I used Chanterelles, Oysters, Cepes, and Chicken-of-the-Woods.

Have to add my kudos to the rest of the raves about this recipe. Made this dish on the spur of the moment for a New Year's Eve dinner for myself and my husband, and it was simply superb. It is rare to find a recipe so simple to prepare with such depth of flavor. We did alter a few things. We love mushrooms, so we increased the amount to about 18 ounces and used a combination of baby bellas, white mushrooms and regular portabellas. Also incresed shallots to 5 or so and added a bit more cream. You can't have too much of this incredible sauce! Used low sodium beef broth (although a good brown stock would be amazing and we plan to try it that way) and did not add any more salt to the recipe. Seasoned the steaks with no-salt seasoned pepper, onion, and garlic, and served with roasted sweet potatoes with a touch of muscovado sugar and cinnamon, and asparagus with roasted red pepper sauce. A "must try" for steak lovers.

The sauce is amazing. I changed the recipe slightly though. I slightly undercooked the filets in a saute pan and then let the filets simmer in the sauce while it thickened. This made the filets even more tender. I also added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce. Next time, I would probably use a more flavorful cut...like a Strip.

If this were any better it would be illegal. I had to use port, like others. Also, my cream had expired and died, so on a whim I substituted a couple spoons full of sour cream. Next time I'll have Madiera and cream, but even so, it was great!

Spectacular! Our guests were blown away. It was very easy to prepare and I will most definitely make it again. I used 1 1/2" filets and encrusted them with salt, pepper & Montreal seasoning before searing them (allow 6-8 minutes per side extra for mediuam rare). I used three times more garlic than called for, used Port(instead of Madeira)and used baby Portabellas & Shitakes (instead of buttons). I will do it the same way next time...and you should too....

Great combination of flavors in the mushroom and madeira sauce. My one quibble would be the amount of liquid called for -- way too much. Next time I will add only half of the stock. The other variation I made was to sear the filets in a cast iron grill pan with clarified butter, then put them in a 450 degree oven for 10 minutes. It's a great way to cook filets (close to foolproof). I will definitely be making this again.

I have one question however...I used a whole bottle of wine and when it cooked down to two cups, it almost was'nt enough for myself and three guests.

I browned a 4 lb beef tenderloin according to the recipe and then grilled it over indirect heat until 120 degrees. I doubled the sauce per the recipe and loved it. The beef was fantastic with a bit of smoky flavor which actually worked well with the sauce. Raves from my guests on both.

I am not a big filet mignon fan, but this recipe actually gives me a reason to buy this cut of meat. Only change, I had about 1.5" thick cuts of meat and I did closer to 4 min a side when I sauteed the filets. With thicker filets be sure and add a little time. The sauce was fabulous - use the madeira.

This is an easy, mouth watering dish to make that would be very impressive for dinner guests. Because I love to grill foods, rather than pan fry the filet, my husband grilled them while I cooked the sauce all at once (not dividing half the shallots/garlic portion as recipe states). We would equate this sauce to one found served in a gourmet restaurant.
