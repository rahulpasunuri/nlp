I was digging through some old magazines and this jumped out at me - it was unbelievable!! YUM if you are looking for something easy to do ahead - this was a winner all round.

I love chocolate and coffee, so I was looking for a sweet mix of chocolate and coffee in a smooth creamy torte. This, however, was a big disappointment. It looked great, but it didn't taste that good (okay, but not great). The chocolate layer tasted just like the chocolate that I put in... might as well have just eaten that plain bittersweet chocolate. And, the coffee part was too strong. I used espresso as per other reviewers' recommendations but it was too much. The flavors didn't blend well for some reason (despite using high quality ingredience). I made this along with the Caramel Toffee Cheesecake (also on epicurious) for a BBQ with 30 people. The cheesecake didn't look as nice, but every single crumb got eaten. There was over 1/2 of this torte left, and unlike the cheesecake, nobody went back for seconds of this.

So about 6 years ago, this was my initiation into the land of EPICURIOUS... my best friend is an "epicurious snob" (which is meant in the most gracious of terms considering she is an AMAZING gourmet cook!)... she made this INCREDIBLE TORTE and I was in *awe*! I knew it was way over my head but kept the recipe in case I ever got the courage up to try it.... Yesterday I decided to face my nemesis! It was an intense recipe and took all the brain waves I had after chasing 3 kids all morning to follow the directions! But... it turned out beautifully! I did change a few minor things. Instead of bringing the crust up the sides - I wanted the layers to show so I just did a crust on the bottom. Then to be sure that it didn't stick to the sides of the springform pan I cut a band of wax paper and placed it around the edge which made it EASY to take off without messing up the edges! Then... I also FROZE it over night and transferred it to the fridge in the morning. I DID NOT TAKE IT OUT OF THE SPRINGFORM PAN UNTIL I ARRIVED AT THE LUNCHEON EITHER to make it easier to transport! One other thing.... I loved the contrast between the coffe/cream and the mousse so I didn't mix the two like it suggested in one of the fianl steps... I just kept them separate. I divided the extra cookie crumbs into three even amounts to use for the layering between the fillings and then I also divided each of the fillings in half so I had 4 different layers and then used a grated chocolate on the top. It was decadent and *beautiful*!

I'm a certified chocoholic and this was way too intense, even for me. If I make it again, I'll use semisweet chocolate and less of it (maybe 8 oz.). I'll also cut the coffee in half and leave the whipped cream layer without any additions. I don't think the crust needs coffee, either.

Do the egg whites essentially "cook" in the syrup? Or are they considered raw?

Beautiful and fun. I had to use Oreo cookies (about 2/3 of an 18-oz. pkg.) instead of chocolate wafers, since I wasn't able to find chocolate wafers in my store. Worked fine. I used instant espresso powder in lieu of the coffee, for a more intense coffee flavor. Use a deep springform pan; mine was full to just above the rim!

This was pleasantly coffee-flavored. I accidentally added too much coffee powder into the chocolate mousse, and still didn't feel like it was overpowering. In fact, I served a Kahlua-based sauce on the side and fresh raspberries for balance. While this dessert was tasty and fairly well-balanced, I didn't think it was particularly sophisticated. Enjoyable, but not necessarily worthy of a second go. I've had better coffee-flavored desserts...

A christmas favorite at our house. Very time consuming, but well worth it. Nice because one of the few desserts you can make 2 days ahead- great for a part- it feeds a lot of people.

Found this recipe when I was looking for a special Thanksgiving dessert in an old issue of Bon Appetit--it was a hit!!! My mom loved this one--she asked me to make it again for Christmas, then asked for the recipe. I also made this for a work Christmas party and was embarassed by all the compliments! This is definetly a favorite dessert that I will make for many years to come! I used Oreo cookie crumbs (found near graham cracker crusts in grocery store) for the crust, made a gingersnap crust once which was delicious as well. This is also one of the very few recipes I've ever made where the finished product looked like the picture in the magazine. A beautiful, elegant dessert that will "wow" the crowd!

I thought it was good; everyone else who had it thought it was great. I made it on a whim cause I had 8 leftover egg whites from another recipe and I was short on a few ingredients. I mixed half cookies and half "smart start" cereal for the crust; I was short on the whipped cream so I just mixed it all together (3/4 cups short) and let it set w/o the layering. Looked like a mouse pie. All the guys loved it- 3 of them ate the whole thing!

very good. i just wish i knew how they get the pictures in the magazine to look sooo perfect- how they kept the chocolate from smearing the cream layer when cutting it. it sure smeared when i cut it. oh well, it was still nice going down.

This recipe is great. I rate it with three forks because I didn't like the wafer crust so much, it was a bit hard, so instead i made a cake base following the recipe given in the mango-orange mousse cake, also at epicurious, just adding to it cocoa powder an coffee. After that change, i have to rate it with four forks since it was the most delicate dessert I've ever made. Great presenation because it's quite high and the softness of the cake goes wonderfully with the mousse ande the mocha cream. Didn't need to freeze it.

I served this at a dinner party, breaking the golden rule having not tried it out first. Everyone loved it. I used Oreo Cookie Crumbs - 1 box. I added a little sugar along with the butter. Shaved chocolate on top. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. It is true it uses about every dish/tool in the house, but it only took a couple hours and I made it the night before. I will definitely be making this again, and expect next time it will go faster. I wouldn't change anything, it was perfect.

I have made this torte time and time again. My friends ask repeatedly if I am going to bring it to an event. It actually freezes wonderfully and is easy to transport frozen. I actually prepared this for a benefit wine dinner for 200 and paired it with Texas Becker port- excellent!

Wonderful, absolutely wonderful! Had a beautiful texture and subtle mocha flavor. Do not let this set out for long, will need to be refrig. just up until cutting. Found that out the hard way! I can't imagine any problems with sweetness, etc. I did use smaller amount of instant expresso powder for my mocha flavor, diluted in warm water. This is a show stopper!

I guess I'm from another planet. I thought this was a revolting concoction. I was looking for a show stopper for the 84th birthday party dinner for my aunt who loves chocolate. I followed this recipe to a T, even using top quality chocolate. It was sickeningly sweet with an overwhelming coffee flavor. I'm a very experienced cook and broke a major rule...never serve something for an important dinner that you haven't already tried. I would never make this again. It lacked finesse and had all the sophistication of a Twinkie.

Excellent recipe. Had no trouble with quantities of crust or whipped cream. Freezes just fine. Very professional looking. The suggestions for serving with a berry sauce sound great.

This came out looking and tasting wonderful. I didn't have chocolate wafers so instead used some chocolate graham crackers and chocolate sandwich cookies. The crumbs didn't look as dark black as the picture so I added chocolate chips, and ground it very finely. It was great. But only make it for a large crowd. It's very rich, and all that fat and cholesterol is better shared among many.

Rating: 4
A truly decadent dessert. It got rave reviews. I do wonder if it's possible that some of the reviewers used a 10" springform instead of a 9". I followed the recipe exactly as written, and was able to fill the pan flush to the top.

Absolutely Fantastic!! I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner & ereyone raved, (even my 8 yr old daughter!)Made it again for a New Years Eve dinner that I helped cater, and it was a HUGE hit! Ihad plenty of filling w/ the cream listed, did not need any more! I even used some Choc/Macadamin nut cookies that I had made for Christmas in the crust! Will definitly make this again!

Great recipe, almost works perfectly the way it's described. Some suggestions: 1) Use more wafers for the crust, I ended up adding another cup or so. I find that Epicurious recipes are notorious for not giving enough crust to actually adequately cover the pan. Either add another cup of cookies or use a smaller springform. I couldn't find chocolate wafers so I added about 4 ounces chocolate to the butter. 2) You definitely need more whipping cream, as other reviewers have noted. I added another cup; adjusting the other stuff in the cream then meant it became 3 3/4 cups whipping cream, 1/3 cups powdered sugar, 1/3 teaspoon cinnamon. 3) Use the best coffee you can find, such as espresso, you can even add vanilla extract and kahlua for more flavor. Make sure the coffee powder actually dissolves; for the filling, I mixed the coffee with the butter first and then added the chocolate. 4) The torte was a bit soft when I served it, so instead I put it in the freezer for about 30-45 minutes beforehand. Otherwise it tends to fall apart if you're cutting small pieces. It will thaw quickly to a good consistency after cut. 5) I added toblerone to the crumb mix that I used for the layering, and topped with coarsely chopped toblerone. Just about anything will work, but plain crumbs seemed a bit boring.

I served this for Christmas dessert and everyone loved it!!! It tastes great and makes for a lovely presentation as well!

I served this for the last course at a late evening Christmas dinner for seven people. I served small portions because ot its richness. Everyone at the table went back for seconds. My lady friend is a chocaholic and she told me this was the best ever. I managed a small piece before it all disappeared. Four forks is not a high enough rating.

This is everything you want in a company dessert! yes, there is some real time involved, but simple overall.Absolutely fabulous and impressive! Do pipe whipped cream on top and shaved chocolate for a real restaurant look. I added a few chocolate dipped strawberries for garnish too. Over the top but soooo worth it. 5 forks!!!

This was an impressive dessert with great flavors. I made a mistake with the chocolate mousse in that I used a packaged product called "egg whites", which I later learned is not recommended for meringues, therefore my mousse layer was a bit flat. (there is a similar product specifically intended for meringues called whipping egg whites or something like that). Despite this faux pas the torte was well recieved and tasted like something you would order at a fancy restaurant.

Definitely a fabulous dessert. I agree it needs some whipped cream piping on top to make it more attractive. And take note: It can be made in advance and frozen!

I made this for New Years Eve, and it was delicious and impressive. It cut beautifully and was a chocolate dream!! I would serve this again, however it is super-rich, and I would serve it with a simpler meal. As someone before me stated, it was a bit fussy, however, well worth the bother, especially for a special occassion.

This was a smashing dessert on our Christmas Eve buffet. It's easy, but beware. It's also time consuming and uses every gadget in your kitchen from food processor to standing mixer (It helps if you have two) with pans and bowls in between. Nevertheless, I'd make it again because it's so darn good.

Loved this recipe!! I would omit the 1/3 additional box of cookie wafers. I used a 10inch pan and there was more than enough chocolate crumbs! I buttered the entire pan to help get the crumbs to stick to the sides. Also, I used instant Espresso powder, which was a superior substitute to regular coffee powder. I would use more whipped cream when I make it again on New Years Eve. I think it would fluff up the coffee whipped cream. I piped the top layer with a pastry bag and an star tip to give it a neat finish. A definate keeper with a very IMPRESSIVE presentation.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and received rave reviews. As others have said, it is a bit time consuming, but definately worth it. It came together perfectly if you followed the directions. Also, same issues with the crumbs not going all the way up the sides of the pan, but it really didn't matter in the end.

A little time consuming but well worth the effort. Made it for the choco-holics' Thanksgiving dessert and all loved it. Crust is a little difficult to get all the way up the sides, but don't panic, it doesn't matter to the end result.

I made this to accompany the usual pumpkin desserts for Thanksgiving dinner. It was almost too rich. I would serve this again with a simpler less rich meal. I used boxed chocolate cookie crumbs, which saved the bother of crushing cookies. I used more crumbs than the recipe called for. That made it easier to pat the crumbs into the springform pan.

As a begining cook, this recipe was a challenge, I had trouble building up the sides of the crust in the springform pan. But the results were worth it. I served it at a Christmas party and received rave reviews. Now I get asked to bring it to every event.

Easy recipe. Candy thermometer a must. I've tried this twice once with high quality bittersweet chocolate & once with Baker's semi-sweet. The bittersweet was richer. If you can't find chocolate wafer cookies, substitute Nilla Wafers and add 3 TB cocoa powder & 1 TB sugar (or to taste) along with the instant coffee when processing crust. Shaved chocolate also makes a nice decoration.

I have made this five (5) times with rave reviews each time.( Even the 2 that didn't survive being put in the baggage hold of a small jet for a one hour flight this past New Years Eve. They sort of exploded but made a wonderful pudding of sorts -- presentation was tough but tasted the same.) I like to serve it with a berry sauce ( rasp, boysen or black ) on the plate with berries and mint garnish. This is a truly wonderful dessert. chocalate lovers go crazy. Also, I use Belgian bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, it makes a difference.
