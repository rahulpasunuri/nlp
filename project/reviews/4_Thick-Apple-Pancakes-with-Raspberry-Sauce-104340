I trimmed the sugar a bit in all parts of the recipe and served it to 13 people for a family brunch. RAVE RAVE reviews. This is a real keeper!! And, if you don't have time for the sauces, just the recipe for the pancakes is fabulous!

This recipe was awesome and easy to make. My granddaughter who is seven, just raved about them.

Very sweet! I could only eat one, but my boyfriend loves them. I think that you could do either one or the other. Just the apples, or just the raspberries. They kind of compete with each other flavor-wise.

I have made these pancakes again and again...everyone always LOVES them! This is one of the best pancake recipes I have encountered. I've never made the raspberry sauce, to me they are perfect with just the fried apples and a little maple syrup!

I've made this numerous times (with & without apples/sauce)and it never fails...loved by all. Easy to make & delicious !

Very good. I used about 1/3 of the sugar it calls for and it was still very sweet. The raspberry sauce and apples really make this a superb dish!

The pancakes were very good but the sauce...oh the sauce! Out of this world! I will probably make the pancakes again but the sauce, definitely will make again and again. Try it on vanilla bean ice cream, on white or chocolate cakes, wow.

DELICIOUS! I subbed the white flour for whole wheat flour, for a healthier option and it turned out great! Very light and fluffy. Will definitely make again!

I took another reviewer's advice and tried not to overmix. Very yummy! I ended up with 10 pancakes and more than enough rapsberry sauce and apples leftover, I think half the amount of rapsberry sauce is sufficient and 4 apples is plenty. Will be making this recipe again and again.

My girlfriend and i made this this morning. It was amazing! I didnt puree or strain the sauce, i dont mind the seeds. I probably would if preparing for company, but for a lazy morning its simpler and still delicious. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious, although we didnt fold them, just piled the apples and sauce on top with whip cream (definitely a great call). Very good recipe and will be making the rest of the batter tomorrow morning for round two.

Skipped the kirsch, added more cinnamon to the apples, and was very glad I read earlier comments on how to avoid chewy pancakes (don't over stir) - it all came out fabulously!

I was very disappointed by this recipe. I followed it exactly no substitutions. The pancakes were somewhat bland and the apples and raspberries overwhelmed them. I also found the pancake did not spread well in the pan, the batter was too thick.

Made these today for the first time and liked them well enough. It is a good pancake recipe they are nice and fluffy. With that said I loved the apples and the raspberry sauce which I actually substituted strawberries for. It was delicious. This is actually the part that makes this recipe.

These pancakes seem a lot more like crepes! I loved them! They were simple and the sauce was to die for. I would make these again!

To A Cook from New York, Ny on 02/15/04: The chewy pancakes that you report may have been as a result of your whisking the batter for too long. Doing so will develop the gluten in the flour too much. Try whisking for less than 15 seconds and don't worry about the lumps in the batter. Hope this helps.

This was by far one of the best pancake recipes i've ever used...For the sauce I did not bother straining the rasberry seeds or puree them. I also added a splash of cognac to the apple mixture. In other words...HEAVENLY!!!

This was the easiest and came out just HEAVENLY! Never made pancakes from scratch because I'm kind of a new cook. This was soo easy! I did substitute 1/2 the flour for wheat flour and the 2 tbl. of butter for applesauce to make them healthier. I also didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used milk. I realize it now is not the same recipe because of all the changes I made but they were still the best! I also didn't realize the apple mixture was supposed to go on top (kinda quit reading the recipe at the end) so I dumped the cooked apples into the batter by mistake. Boy, that ended up being a great mistake because they were delicious!!!

I just made these for breakfast this morning and mine kind out kind of chewy - I followed the recipe exactly and am wondering if perhaps I cooked them too long? How hot should the pan be when you pour in the batter? Also, my batter was kind of thick, is this right? I thought they were delicious, but the "traditional" pancake eaters thought the consistency/texture was kind of strange. Any suggestions?

I've made these pancakes for one of my Personal Chef clients who's two favorite fruits are apples and rasberries and he absolutely flipped over them!!! They also freeze nicely, just make the pancakes, saute the apples and cool each separately, then assemble, package in a container and pop in the freezer (it's important to make sure everything is absolutely cooled completely!)...I package the raspberry sauce in small single serving containers as well....i've even served this to him as a dessert....microwaved it, served with the sauce, fresh raspberries and sliced strawberries, then drizzled with a little contreau and light with a match...according to my client, heaven!!!

This recipe is SOOOO fantastic. I've made it several times for my family for a quiet winter dinner and for guests for brunch. Everyone loves it and we all go away so full we wish we hadn't eaten so much but still wanting to eat more anyway! The proportion of apples to pancake batter turns out perfectly every time. I like to mix 1/2 lb cream cheese with a little milk and powdered sugar until smooth and let people dollop it on top of their pancakes. This makes it a little more substantial of a meal. Also, this is often a spur of the moment idea to make, and I don't usually have raspberries on hand. I came up with a little variation others might enjoy. Just put some jam (we especially like Strawberry) in a saucepan with a little apple juice. Heat over low heat until jam melts and juice is combined. I haven't added the liqueur, but I'm sure it would be great.

I made this with a few changes. I used 1/2 freashly ground whole wheat & white floure mixture and added raspberry liquor instead of brandy very yummy.

Delicious! I only made half the sauce because i knew my kids wouldn't eat it but now wish i had made it all becuase it would have been great to use on ice cream (if there had been any left!)

I made these pancakes this morning and they were delicious! I made half of a recipe for our family of three, but would gladly make again when we have guests.

Best pancake batter ever. I added peaches to my apples. And made sauce with fresh strawberries. Everyone liked it. My husband ate five. This is great recipe and definately does not need to be made in advance. It goes quick.

My excuse for a grocery store only had strawberries, but it worked really well. I agree with the other reviewer, if you're going to make something this fantastic, might as well bring out the whipped cream to top it all off. This is a fantastic weekend breakfast. You could even do up the sauce, put the dry ingredients together and then cover the night before. In the morning you could then just sautee the apples and add the wet ingredients to the dry mix.. Don't leave anything out.. all ingredients add up to make this dish great.

This is GREAT! I made it for Christmas breakfast and it was easy and it was a hit wiht all of the family.

Excellent recipe. I only made half the raspberry sauce and that was fine. These were a huge hit but if you are pressed for time skip the raspberry sauce and just serve with maple syrup. My family devoured these pancakes in about 10 minutes!

Awesome. Skipped the raz sauce and served w/ real maple syrup. Made the full pancake recipe, but halved the apples and served pancakes w/ and w/o apples. The apple pancakes were by far the most popular. Will makes these again (with the apples!)

Fabulous pancakes. I made a half recipe for my husbands birthday and they were incredible!

Rating: 4
This is by far the best Epicurious recipe I've tried. It's now my signature breakfast dish when having people over for breakfast or brunch. The only thing I would not is that, at least as far as I found, the raspberry sauce recipe can be halved to avoid a lot of extra sauce.

It is a good recipe

These were so good (spongy but not heavy). I accidentally didn't add any butter to the batter but they were still some of the best pancakes I have ever had (and I've tried more than 40 recipes). I will make this again. I made them 4" and dropped blueberries in them and served with syrup for a weekday breakfast. Also, I didn't use all the batter the 1st morning and the pancakes from the leftover batter on the 2nd morning were just as fluffy and nice as the originals. I'll try them with the apples and raspberries this weekend. Highly recommeded.

This is a great recipe. Even when I saw it I thought wow that sounds really good. I made it for breakfast on Valentines Day and my 9 year old sister loved it. I am 12 years old so it was really easy to make. Even my parents were impressed.

Yum! Made these when we were out "camping" in our Rv. What a treat. I was surprised when they folded over so nicely.

This is one recipe we use over and over. My husband made them for our daughter's eight birthday sleepover and the girls devoured them and reports by some parents is that they are the best pancakes ever made!

Fantastic - although the yield on the raspberry sauce was more than needed. Great for brunch. Highly recommend.

A family favorite. The pancakes are stand-alone without the apples and raspberries. But, if you're going to make this, don't stop at the recipe, TOP IT OFF WITH WHIPPED CREAM!

Sweet, yummy pancakes with delicious apples and raspberry sauce. A little time-consuming in the beginning, but there were enough apples and sauce for two batches of pancakes. A brunch standout.

This is a wonderful recipe and always gets rave reviews. I made one small substitution on the steps and it saved a lot of time. I did not assemble the pancakes as I went along. I kept the pancakes I had already completed warm in the oven and finished making the remaining pancakes. I then brought all of the components (raspberry sauce, apples, and pancakes) to the table. Every one had a great time assembling their own pancake right at the table.
