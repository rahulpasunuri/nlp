Wow! What a fabulous dessert. Our dinner guests LOVED it. I made this in December so had to use canned apricots instead of fresh and it was still wonderful. I'm making it again for another dinner party this weekend but will start it the day before rather than do it all on the day of the party. Try it, your guests will think you are a culinary wizard.

Absolutely delicious and the semi- freddo is pretty easy. You just need a bit of patience to whip the egg mix for the required cooking time. My company and family raved over this creation. I was concerned that the grappa might be quite strong, but the reduction process created a sauce that complimented the fruit and nut combination.

Excellent semifreddo version !!! I couldn't get almond extract so I used Amaretto Lazzaroni instead wich is made with apricot's kernel cookies. Please don't use almond artificial flavour, it will ruin the dessert !!! For apricots, I used Nonino's UE uva bianca distillate, definitely a hit!!. Try using a high quality grappa or grape distillate, it will make the difference. As other reviewer said, semifreddos are vey easy to make and are an excellent choice in summer. It's texture is also lighter than ice cream. Definitely will make it again !!!

Contrary to reviewer Brussel below, semifreddos are not really that much work and I find them very gratifying. I haven't made this one yet but I plan to update this review after I've made it.

Part of one line was deleted from the recipe. Part of the ingredient list for the apricots should read: 1/2 cup grappa 8 apricots, etc.

Hard to rate as the grappa seems to be missing? Sounds like a wonderful combination - even if a lot of work on a hot summer day.
