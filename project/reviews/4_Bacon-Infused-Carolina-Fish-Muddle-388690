This is a great basis for muddle. All sorts of fish can be used including pond fish which are in abundance here in North Carolina. As far as grits, when I'm far away and can't find any, I made cornmeal mush, or polenta as it's known in some parts.

I didn't have grits handy, so I served this on crispy rice cakes -- prepare white rice according to instructions, spread it on a cookie sheet and dry it in the oven uncovered 350F for 30mins while stirring every 15mins, form into flat rice cakes (resembling size/shape of hockey pucks), broil the tops for 3 minutes until golden. This gives some nice crunchy contrast, with the rice becoming similar to the texture you'd fine in bibimbop (Korean stone pot rice). I also reserved some of the bacon to sprinkle on top so it stayed crispy, and added some breaded fried perch (soak perch in milk, dip in flour seasoned with salt and paprika, fry in a skillet with butter). Overall, the dish as written (i.e. disregarding my additions) was fair, although not particularly unique. It tasted more or less like a cioppino with a bit more bacon flavor.

Excellent! I used shrimp, scallops and tilapia. My wife Doesn't like heat so i left out the seeds from the jalapeño and just added the Chalula hot sauce in my serving. We'll definitely make this again!

This was excellent. I cut the recipe in half, made the shrimp shell stock and added some Tilapia instead of the other fish (because it was on hand). Wonderful!
