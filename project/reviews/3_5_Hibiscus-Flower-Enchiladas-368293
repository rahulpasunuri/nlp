Excellent! A surprisingly good dish - never would have imagined hibiscus flower as part of a meal!

Made this recipe this weekend for Cinco de Mayo and everyone loved it! It's a fantastic dish to try that's not just tex-mex but a real Oaxacan treat. I also used about a tablespoon of sugar. And the chipotle sauce was delicious on eggs the next day, great amount of spice with only 2 chiles.

What a great recipe ... definitely outside the norm. If you have access to dried hibiscus, definitely give this a go. I like spicy foods and did find the chipotle sauce to be a bit too spicy. I might just use one chipotle next time instead of two. As a previous reviewer noted, make sure you don't use two CANS of peppers, it will definitely be much too hot. One to two peppers should provide plenty of heat. I did lightly fry the tortillas in grapeseed oil and was pleased with the texture and warmth.

I chopped the hibiscus flowers really fine and they gave a nice chewy texture. This was a unique vegetarian dinner.

I was reading reviews trying to decide whether or not to attempt this recipe, and I noticed that people were mentioning how spicy it was. I think those who thought it was too spicy might have misread the recipe. It states: 2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo....2 chilies, not 2 cans. I can't even imagine using an entire can in a dish, let alone 2. Otherwise, I'm very excited to try it and will post a proper review once I've made them!

Who knew hibiscus flowers were such a great meat substitute?! Great recipe. I used about 1/2 the amount of sugar and only 1 can of chipotle peppers (still very spicy). I did not fry the tortillas but simply threw them in my cast iron two by two with a little bit of oil. This is a great dish - sure to please at your next Mexican themed dinner party.

So Yummy! I skipped the frying of the tortillas to make this dish a bit lighter and healthier. Instead I spread some sauce on the bottom on baking dish, and baked the rolled enchiladas in sauce smothered with feta and chedder cheese. Also used the left over red cabbage mixed with apple cider vinegar, yogurt, and sour cream to cool down the meal. The chipotle sauce is very spicy if you include all the canned sauce.

This was delicious but the sauce was way too spicy, and I like spicy food. I ended up making a second, milder sauce for the enchiladas and served the hot version as a condiment that people could use for an extra kick if they wanted it. Next time I will use only half the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or even less. I cut the sugar in the filling a little and it was still fantastic - the carrots are sweet enough. Use fresh tortillas if you can get them. Yum!

Very nice, great flavors all the way around. I think this is far superior to the typical casserole-style enchiladas that we Americans make. Even if you decide to make a meat-based filling (it may be hard to find the hibiscus flowers), this method of assembling and serving really allows the individual flavors to compliment each other, rather than the melding together of flavors that happens in casserole-style enchiladas. I topped these with thinly sliced avocado instead of the sour cream, and the cotija cheese is a mild contrast to the bold chipotle sauce and tasty hibiscus filling.
