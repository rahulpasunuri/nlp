Not a huge fan. Even after reading others' reviews and browning the eggplant in the broiler, I felt that the eggplant was the weakest part of this dish. The sauce was nice enough, and I really enjoyed the flavor and the color of the edamame, but the shiitake mushrooms were very strong flavored and over powered the sauce. I think you'd be better off using white button mushrooms or baby bellas, more harmonious, and save the money invested in the shiitakes for something else.

I didn't make it exactly as written, but it was close enough to rate. As other reviewers noted, I cut the eggplant a little thinner than called for. I cooked the eggplant in batches, then put it all back in in the pot at the end to soak up the wine. Didn't have pumpkin, so I only roasted the tomatoes with onion (no shallots) and didn't bother with the deglazing liquid. Cooked the mushrooms as written, but added wine to deglaze and substituted oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes for the herbs called for. I mashed up the tomatoes before adding them to the mushrooms, and used frozen peas instead of soybeans (which seemed like an odd choice). Finally, I wilted some spinach into the ragu before serving over the eggplants, and omitted the balsamic. The sauce was fabulous after a little extra salt, and the ragu could be modified any number of ways for other dishes. Going in the rotation for sure.

not awful... the eggplant was disappointing, as many here have noted. the ragout was only ok--not bad, not good. a little too concentrated, too assertive, i thought. i used fresh limas from my garden. they were a nice addition. my wife remarked that this would have been much better without the eggplant and instead some cheddar biscuits or maybe some fluffy mashed potatoes.

I loved the ragout and the roasted squash and tomatos. The eggplant was a real disappointment though. Because it was so thick, I was worried that it wouldn't cook through. The result was cooked but tasted rubbery and flavorless. Next time, I would cut half inch rounds of the eggplant and through it in with the squash for roasting.

This was such a flavorful dish.I was hoping it would be for all the time it took to prepare.Definately well worth the trouble.I used onion instead of shallot,and kobucho squash instead of pumpkin.I will make this again for sure, but this time I will do some of the cooking in stages like the recipe suggests.

LOOKING for a vegetarian dish for the whole family? This does the fix a lot of time for prep but my picky 2 yr and 5 yrold gobbled it up, while my mother-in-law was a bit jealous of the popularity and impressiveness of the meal!! I will make this again . I did tweak it: no lima beans or balsamic vinegar used just vinegar

This is the most incredible vegetable dish I've ever tasted. The combination of shallots, rosemary, and balsamic vinegar makes this dish mouth watering. You could easily skip the eggplant and serve the ragout over brown rice or a whole grain combination. Cooking notes: I used far less olive oil than specified.

We served this at a dinner party attended by vegans, vegetarians and omnivores and everyone raved about it. A really big hit. I made the recipe as is (though I doubled if for a bigger crowd). My only modification: I sliced the eggplants lengthwise to get bigger "steaks."

Excellent ragout! Made this several times already, every time got splendid reviews. The most popular variation includes sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin , sherry tomatoes instead of plum and broiled asparagus instead of edamame (out of necessity, but it turned out very good).

POSITIVES: a.) Its a very colourful dish and pleasing to present b.) Its one of the few vegan entrees on this site. NEGATIVES: a.) I found that the shiitake mushrooms contributed very little other than expense b.) The eggplant was so-so. I imagine it would be better roasted with seasonings c.) I would have increased the amount of garlic and rosemary. d.) It takes a long time to prepare, and again, the outcome wasn't overwhelming.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I didn't make the eggplant, but the ragout was wonderful. I used butternut squash instead of pumpkind, and roasted the tomatoes for twice the specified time. Cremini mushrooms worked perfectly. I inadvertently left out the edamame, but I don't think the dish really suffered, although I will use them next time for the green factor. A little time consuming in terms of oven time, but very easy and wonderful!

The ragout was FABULOUS, but the eggplant steaks themselves - not so much. I browned the eggplant and cooked it in wine exactly as per the recipe. It turned out slightly sour and oddly flavourless. Next time, I would skip the eggplant steaks and serve the ragout over brown rice and roast the eggplant with the other veggies and add it directly to the ragout. The ragout would also be great as a side to roast chicken, if making for meat-eaters. I used portabello and regular mushrooms (the store was out of chanterelles) in the ragout, and although the portabellos tasted great, I wouldn't use them again as they tinted the ragout slightly black due to their dark gills. You could easily make this with just plain mushrooms, and also use green beans cut into thirds instead of lima beans or edamame. Overall, pretty labour-intensive, but if you omit the eggplant steaks and just make the ragout it's not so bad, and the ragout is DEFINITELY worth the effort.

My dinner guests liked this recipe better than me. Would definitively make it again for others, not for myself. Very labor intensive for one person.

When faced with the dilemma of making one dish for friends, some of whom are vegatarians and some who are definitely not, make this one! The flavor is so big that even the meat eaters will love it! A definite "make again"!

I sauteed the eggplant, used butternut squash, chanterelles and frozen lima beans. Replaced the water with a homemade vegetable stock. Fantastic. I can't wait to make this with fresh fava beans!

I bought some chanterelle mushrooms and some squash at a farmer's market and found this recipe to use both of them. I am not a huge eggplant lover (rare in a vegetarian), but I thought it was delicious here. I brushed it with olive oil and cooked it in a 375 degree oven for about 25 minutes, then continued with the recipe. The only thing I would change is to add more tomatoes. This is a lovely dish for chanterelles because, although there are lots of wonderful flavors in this dish, their delicate flavor is heightened rather than overwhelmed.

I made this recipe for six vegetarians, two of whom are vegans. By cutting the eggplant lengthwise, I got larger "steaks" than by cutting the eggplant across, but still there were no leftovers! The soybeans added great color as well as protein. I agree with a previous reviewer who recommended broiling instead of sauteing the eggplant.

Excellent! Yes, it was a bit time consuming, but well worth it! Just make sure you have some neglected chore to do while you are waiting for those yummy veggies to roast! I didn't have shallots on hand, so I just used onions, and I too only used the plain-jane variety of mushroom, but it was superb! Next time will try it the fancier way. Only problem: my husband loved it so much I only got to enjoy 1 eggplant steak! Note to self: hide half in the back of fridge next time!

Delicious! I didn't bother with the soybeans and used red wine instead of white. The steaks were a bit pink, but the flavour was excellent.

This was surprisingly tasty. I made the poor man version with ordinary mushrooms and consume instead of wine and Chanterelles. Though I'm sure the flavour would be even better, it was delicious. The recipe reads more complicated than the actual preparation really is. We served with rice. As a vedgie, I thought it was great, my husband - no vedgie, but is a chef! thought it was excellent.

Eggplant can ALSO be roasted, with MUCH less oil.

This was fabuluous to eat and to look at. I reduced the oil for who needed it to be more fat free. My meat eater friends raved about it. Actually it was served at a Passover Sedar!

As delicious as it is beautiful! Meat-eating coworkers were commenting on my leftovers the next day. I think there is an error in the "preparation time;" in a rush, I roasted the tomatoes with the squash and had the whole thing done in forty-five minutes.

Fantastic recipe--uses widely-available ingredients and results in an unexpectedly complex and delicious entree. Made for solid vegetarians who were very impressed.
