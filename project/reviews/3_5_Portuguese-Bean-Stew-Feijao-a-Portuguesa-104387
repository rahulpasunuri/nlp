I don't usually review things we didn't like, but this was pretty nasty. I used a VERY spendy hunk of chorizo, and kind of feel like I wasted it. The paprika flavor overwhelmed even the yummy bacon and sausage...those flavors were all but lost. Ick.

For the second year in a row, our spring in Chicago has reverted to winter, after teasing us with single days here and there of summer-like temps. So I went looking for a nice soup to take the edge off the nasty cold and wet weather. I visited Lisbon last year and fell in love with the country and food. So glad to find a few recipes on the epicurious site to recreate the experience! I made a hybrid version of the soup using this recipe and the recipe in PORTUGUESE HOMESTYLE COOKING. Added: extra garlic; combination of hot and smoked paprika; can of diced tomatoes; 1 small yukon gold potato, small dice; chicken broth for water; a little extra red pepper; and a tbsp of cilantro to finish it off. It is delicious with my Casal Garcia Vinho Verde.

what about the chourizo - when and how is it used - i don't see its use in the directions.

I made this dish for my in-laws as they are Portuguese. They loved it! A big hit!

This is now a staple. It's best served the following day w/an egg cracked over the top of each serving & stirred in. It adds a bit of richness to it. So good!

Got good reviews from guests! Maybe it's a Texas thing but this could be better by substituting a jalapeno for the red hot pepper flakes.

This is a great flavored stew, but the Norhtern beans never got soft, even after the next day of heating it up again.I wonder what I did wrong, after all 8 hrs. of soaking the beans were still not hard but not soft enought to enjoy.! HELP

for this to be Portuguese beans you would have to add cumin, cinnamon and bay leaf and leave out the hot pepper, it isn't Mexican beans.

I'm really not a very experienced cook but found this stew simple to make and extremely satisfying to eat! Will definitely make it again (but will use less chilli paste, which I substituted for pepper flakes). www.millymossop.typepad.com

I love this bean soup/stew. It is the best ever, bar none. Simple to make, rich in flavour, with a most appealing colour and texture. I remember when it first appeared in Goumet magazine, it was contributed by a man who didn't want his mother's wonderful recipe to be forgotten. It may not look like much, but if you like beans... this is the recipe for you. You could use spicy chorizo if you want, or 1/2 and 1/2, for a bit more kick. Thanks to that gentleman for honouring his mother by generously sharing his childhood memories with us.

This recipe gets rave reviews everytime! I add chicken broth along with the water and substitute hot paprika for the pepper flakes. Good quality chorizo will make all the difference. Works well with canned beans when you are in a hurry.

thumbs down.. a spicy version of great northern bean soup is what it is...

This was great. I used two cans of black beans and 3 cups of water, and let about half of the liquid boil off. It tasted like a fantastic, flavorful chili.

I was thoroughly disappointed with this dish after the reviews it received. It tasted like a bland form of beans & weenies. My very non-picky boyfriend begged me not to make it again.

I used some horribly expensive chorizo but I think it was worth. This was an amazing dish. I used canned cannellini beans instead to save time. Great having left overs the next day!!

Made with fresh chorizo from butcher and threw in a couple of left over tomatoes. Was delicious!

Tried making this dish, because my partner is Portuguese, and because it's getting chilly outside. Totally old-school, heart-warming and awesome! The only thing I did differently was to add some bay leaves to the simmering pot.

We have become addicted to Feijao from a local Portuguese/Brazilian take out place so I searched for a recipe. While this was cooking my husband and I knew we were in for something good - it smelled just right. It was spicier but that's fine with us. I also added carrots since the feijao we get has them and I can't pass up a chance to add vegetables. Delicious and very easy!

This is one of my husband's (very picky) favorite recipes. Definitely a thumbs up.

Delicious! It tasted great after a day in the fridge as well. Certainly a dish that will be made again.

Wonderful dish. Great for a cool, rainy night. The cooking liquid reduced perfectly to a thick, spicy sauce - I am not sure why the previous reviewer had a problem. Perfect with crusty bread and a simple green salad. One note: the chorizo I use are long and thin and, in my experience, if cooked too long dry out. So I only added them at the end (after the beans were tender). They stayed succulent. Yum. And I too am very impressed that the author responded to a complaint.

I'm impressed that the author of a recipe would respond to comments and give some insight and helpful hints for preparing his/her recipe. I look forward to preparing this recipe by your recommendations. Thank you.

Although I expected this dish to turn out fine, given all the nice reviews it got, I was really ASTONISHED at the resulting taste. This one is sorted now with my mother's recipes!

I asked the first question about the chorizo, so can now follow up. When I first tried this in December, I was stranded at home on a snow day with number of hungry, cold, children from the neighborhood who had been out enjoying their day and were now looking for lunch. I searched the site for something to make from the supplies on hand, one of which was mexican-style chorizo (not precooked). I cooked the sausage first and then followed the recipe - even with the deviation it was perfect for that day and well-received by all, which is an extra compliment because the kids' tastes are usually different. After reading the comments, I was curious to try again with the spanish or portugese chorizo, which we were able to do this week. And again, a great hearty stew which my family is now beginning to crave on cold days. Thanks!

It was simple to make, and excellent to eat. Reheats extremely well, in fact improves if served the next day. Wonderful winter fare, it's perfect with homemade bread for supper at the end of a cold winter day, with just a salad to start.

Thisis very similar to a dish my Portuguese grandmother used to make. Delicious.

This stew was absolutely delicious! Although I too was confused about when to add the chorizo. I had to use mexican chorizo so I guess I didn't get the true flavor, but it was still delicious. My husband crumbled corn bread on top and he loved it.

I made this recently and loved it! I don't eat red meat, so I substituted turkey sausage and turkey bacon--but be warned, I needed to add some olive oil because the turkey bacon doesn't really leave drippings and it also doesn't crumble well, so I cut it with kitchen scissors. But it was still delicious, a great hearty winter meal. My family, who is not food-adventurous, thought it was great.
