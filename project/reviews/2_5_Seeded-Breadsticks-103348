It was quite tasty and well-received. I found that it didn't need 20 minutes in the oven; at 15 they were close to burning. I think this has the flexibility to be a good recipe, but more details would be helpful, such as the kind of toppings you could add. Plus, there seems to be a typo in the list of ingredients. Plus additional flour for what?

I thought this dough needed to be more elastic and soft. It was quite crumbly and I wanted breadsticks that were more soft and chewy. They were ok though, if you want crunchier sticks. Not bad at all dipped in pasta sauce. Still, if anyone has a more doughy recipe, please email me!
