Caution: Making these will cause you to be disappointed with all other crab cakes you eat.

This is not a review of this recipe, rather a testimonial to the fact that this is the most accurate recipe for a authentic "Baltimore style" crab cake I have ever seen (text and photo). Except of course for one key missing ingredient, and probably the most important besides the crab. Old Bay. If anyone says you don't need Old Bay to make a crab cake, then, you might as well not trust anything they ever say. I was eating crab cakes before I could talk and continued enjoying them through my childhood until I was grown and the head of my own kitchen. Now, just like when I was younger, crab cakes are a staple in my house, and I make them year round. In my (and I can honestly say, others) opinion, no one makes a better one than me. And if I ever forget how, this will be my go to recipe for them. Oh, mustard and saltine crackers are the only real condiment to eat with crab cakes. And even then it's meant to be a sort of pallet cleanser used with very slight moderation every third or forth bite so as to enhance the flavor of the star, the crab. Is there a variation on this? Yea, spicy brown or regular mustard. Rob

We LOVE this recipe. It is very delicious and works every time. It is crumbly but ends up looking like their photo. I've tried Cook's Illustrated "Best Crab Cakes" recipe and this one beats it by a mile. It is quick, easy, light, and DELICIOUS. I've made them and frozen them, thawed in the fridge, and they were still delicious. It is my go-to Crab Cake Recipe.

Made 'em basically as written last night, albeit with a little more crab meat. Mr & I were underwhelmed. (OK, DH was underwhelmed... *I* was dragging my pouty lower lip on the floor after all that cracking & shell excavation resulted in a mediocre cake!) Had 3 patties left over and baked 'em for 15 mins @ 400 tonight on a pre-heated baking sheet and they were amazeballs. Go figure! Served with a quickie sauce of mayo +Siracha+lime juice & zest.

I've now made this recipe several times and love it. True to the recipe's claim, these are wonderfully crabby, not bready. I use the sprouted bread I usually eat (vs. white bread) to make the crumbs. I read somewhere that refrigerating the mixture for 20 mins before cooking helped it hold together better, and I think that's true. A great dish for entertaining.

I've made these many times now and as long as I use good lump crab (crucial), they're excellent every time. I frequently decrease the mayo a tiny bit just b/c my husband doesn't like it. They're still incredible. I sprinkle his with old bay and leave mine alone, they're all delicious.

Being a West Coaster, used Dungeness...cleaning is a Zen experience...makes you appreciate even more. Used a little more crab & bread(ciabatta) & whole egg to hold together. Otherwise by the book. Sauted in sweet butter & olive oil. Got five slightly larger crab cakes. They were perfect. The comments always help.

I forgot the worcestershire and it was still good. I added a bit of old bay seasonning and s & p. Perfect, clean recipe which lets the star of the show sing...the crab meat!

Made this dish last weekend for a football party as an appetizer. Used a lot of the previous tips-doubled the Worcestershire, added Old Bay, used olive oil, etc. Made small 2" patties. They went in a flash. My wife told me they were the best crabcakes she has ever had. No more ordering crab cakes out at a restaurant, we will make these.

These are so delicious we're changing our New Year's menu to include these! I made just a few modifications 1) Used the whole egg per previous reviewers. 2) Used a light coating of Panko which absorbed the rich taste of butter ((tried 2 cakes with Panko and 2 without)) 3)Used a little olive oil along with butter to prevent burning. 4)And personal preference only~~broke up big chunks of crab. I think the bread chunks, instead of bread crumbs and the Worcestershire sauce are the key ingredients to an already wonderful dish. This is our new favorite crab cake recipe

Excellent recipe for the purist! Minimal seasoning really lets you taste the crab. Also pairs well with a spicier side dish of herbed oven roasted potatoes.

This is a great basic recipe for crabcakes. Mine came out perfectly. My changes: used the whole egg, doubled the Worcestershire sauce (kind of by accident), used fresh breadcrumbs I already had on hand (about 1/3 - 1/2 cup), and about a half teaspoon of Emeril's Creole Seasoning (not having any Old Bay around) instead of the salt. I used butter and oil in the pan together so that it wouldn't burn as easily. The thing about adding breadcrumbs is that you have to pay attention and only add enough to allow things to come together and not too much so that it gets dry. Stick the patties in the fridge for 30 mins. before cooking, too, and that'll help them stay together.

As others, I modified this recipe a bit. I used the entire egg and whole wheat potato bread and added a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning. The first time I made it I used white bread, but every other time I've used the whole wheat potato bread. It's what I had available and I found that it adds a great sweet taste to the cakes. In addition to tasting great, they are incredibly easy to make.

Made it with leftover king crab meat for brunch. Topped with a simple mayo, garlic, balsamic & herb aioli. Fabulous!

I revised this recipe and little after reading some of the reviews. I used the entire beaten egg instead of just part of it to ensure it would hold together. This worked out fine. As one reviewer commented that this tasted too " bready " I decided to use only one slice of bread instead of two. Unfortunately I used the end piece of a buttermilk loaf. This only caused the taste to be want I was trying to avoid....too bready :( I wasn't sure what " firm " white sandwich bread meant in the recipe.

I liked these. Followed suggestions, used a little Old Bay and dry mustard in the mixture. Also used a single slice of multigrain bread as that was all I had. Sauteed in a tsp of olive oil instead of butter. 3 WW points if you're counting. ;)

Fabulous crab cakes from this recipe. I used fresh crab (quantity may have been more because I was using leftovers & wanted to use it up), bread from a crusty loaf made by Ace bakery (in Toronto) the only thing I addes was 1 small chopped green onion. They were even better cold. I served it with a tomator bruschetta mix to which I added horseradish, there's where you get your kick.

Very tasty, easy to make, served with hot sauce there is no need for a lot of ingredients (only problem was they did not hold together that well)

I made these for Christmas and they were very good, but I felt would have been better with some heat. They needed something such as jalapeno or cayenne. I also used the entire egg after the mixture was too crumbly. They cook up beautifully!

To the "cook in the USA" ~ you "wonder what went wrong"? Are you joking? What went wrong was you didn't use the recipe. And you're suggesting that others don't make this recipe? Kind of whacky!

Marylander's everywhere are saddened. Bread in a crabcake and no Old Bay???? Shameful.

Rating: 4
This is the way to do crab cakes--no peppers, no onions, just a little filler...The only thing I added was Old Bay because were're from Baltimore, and crab cakes just aren't crab cakes without some Old Bay. We added a bit to the mix and then srinkled the crab cakes with more Old Bay while they were in the pan. These crab cakes were perfectly seasoned, and they were just the right ratio of filler to meat. I could actually do with a little less filler, but it would make them difficult to flip. Overall, I would highly reccomend this recipe.

Very close to the crab cakes I grew up on. Mine were always served on round crackers with mustard on top. So I see why people are adding dry mustard to the mix. I was fine without the old bay, I used 1.5 slices of bread and that worked out just about right. I goofed and put the butter in the crab cakes and they survived that error. might try baking them sometime, just to see how that works.

I decided to make this at the end of the day, so didn't have time to drive around for the ingredients - had to mix canned crabmeat with the real thing. Also, since this was a first attempt at a recipe like this, I wasn't sure of the consistency - when the mixture looked too "crumbly" I added egg - in the end it was a whole egg, which was soaked up by the bread and made the result very very delicious, but maybe too rich for some people. We loved it - my husband thought it was his birthday dinner when it wasn't even his birthday yet!

This was my first try at crabcakes and it was so easy and they came out very good. However, there were bland- the Old Bay and mustard suggestions worked even better the next time I made them. GREAT recipe.

This was a perfect crabcake..just follow the recipe. Thank God I didn't use canned Tuna and flour. Hopefully that review was a joke...if not , what an idiot.

I first heard of "Crab Cake" during a summer trip to Denmark in the mid-1980's. When I saw this recipe, I knew I simply had to try it! Boy, was I disappointed... First of all, being allergic to seafood I substituted the crab with a can of "tuna" I found at a fancy gourmet grocery store down the road from Jim. Being deaf in one ear, the thought of using the "firm white sandwich bread" specified in this recipe did not appeal to me, so I used about a cup and a half of flour to give it some texture and flavor. I'm not sure what went wrong, but there was nothing cake-like about this dish. Two thumbs down - do NOT try this recipe!

Easy to make! I agree that - as is - "without Old Bay seasoning, these are just a lump of crabmeat laying on the plate." Although good, they were bland. Next time I will add some of the suggestions offered here; all sound sensible.

A hands down winner, and that says a lot considering how picky my wife and I are over crab cakes! The first time we cooked these my better half ate FIVE! (One half of one was mine which she snatched while I was cooking the second round.) Wonderful with a nice Tocai Friulano...preferably a Bragato.

I agree w/others you need some Old Bay and some dry mustard. Also, I bake them in the oven instead of frying and they are delicious. They stay together better that way too. Saves a lot of calories--so you can eat more of them!

Very nice but try seasoned crutons, and a little digon with the mixture. Really brings out the flavor.

Good as is. Old Bay is a seasoning that is way too salty. Probably authentic, but in this day of people needing to watch salt content and too many not doing so, it's good to have a recipe that doesn't call for it.

This is a "good" recipe but not the best I've had by far. White bread softened with milk, Old Bay,a little lemon juice, touch of dry mustard are a must. The best crab cake I've ever eaten wat at the Robert Morris Inn on Eastern Shore, MD.

These are nice if you like bread and eggs. I process onions and celery plus 8 peeled shrimp and add that to the crab meat together with creole seasoning.

I used whole wheat bread and canned refrigerated crabmeat and the crab cakes were still very good. I'm sure they are fantastic made with fresh crab and white bread.

Rating: 3
This recipe closely resembles mine, but I agree with many of the other reviewers; it needs less bread and a bit of Old Bay, and I add a half teaspoon of dry mustard as well. I typically put the bread in a blender to process it to soft crumbs, and mix it and the other dry ingredients with the crab by hand (so as not to break up the lumps). I whisk the liquid ingredients together in another bowl, and add just enough to the crab mixture to make it moist, but not soupy.

These are fabulous! I agree they need some lemon, so I made a lemon vinaigrette and tossed some green beans in it which I served beneath the cakes, it added some essential acidity.

This is a good sauce, the one made with sour cream is good...but, rich..next time, use plain yoghurt(drained a bit) instead....fat free is wonderful. And, grate the cucumber on the large grate, is faster. YUM...called Tzaziki by the Greeks...YUM...YUM!!!

I don't even have to make this as I know the recipe well. It is nearly an exact duplicate of my beloved Nannie's recipe. The only thing she added was squeeze of lemon juice. I also sok my bread in a little milk. I roll mine in cracker crumbs, let sir in the frige for a few minutes, and fry quickly. I agree with the cook from Houston. I, too, add a dash of Old Bay. Absolutely fabulous. Everyone should try these once. Yummy.

I would suggest soaking the bread pieces in half and half first and then squeezing out the excess liquid, also the Chesapeake Bay seasoning is missing, you need 1 tsp I would skip the worcstershire, no one around our area would use that. I make these all the time either with crabs we have caught or in the winter with store bought crabmeat

Without Old Bay seasoning, these are just a lump of crabmeat laying on the plate. Needs Old Bay (a must add) to be a genuine Crab Cake.

Loved it! My husband said they tasted just as good as any restaurants! I really liked the simplicity of the ingredients although I did add chopped green onions, old bay seasoning, cracked black pepper and cayenne pepper for a little kick. On accident I added 1 tablespoon of worchestire sauce so I added an extra peice of bread to even it out and they came out perfect!

To the cook from Seattle. An idea for a sauce. Cucumber dill sauce - 1C sour cream, 1/4C mayo, 1t dried dill, 1C chopped, peeled & seeded cucumbers, lemon juice & pepper to taste. This sauce is good warm or cold.

Very simple to make and very good. I used 1.5 slices of bread instead of 2 slices. I had a little problem with crab cakes falling apart but not that much. I might increase the bread a very little next time. Anone have a recipe for a sauce that could go with this, perhaps even double as thick salad dressing?

Tried it with and without Old Bay and will stick with WITHOUT - too much celery seed/salt flavor. Also, thank you, Annapolis, Md. (too much bread!)

TOOOOOO much bread. Use a crumbled saltine or two, as little bread as possible to 'glue' them together. refrigerate for ten to fifteen minutes to let the cake set so it doesn't fall apart when cooking.

A perfect, simple crab cake recipe. If you feel compelled, you could add a little green onion or some Old Bay, but this recipe is just there to hold the crab together while you cook it. Br sure to saute them in butter and cook just enough to cook the egg.

I can't imagine making crab cakes without mixing in some Old Bay but if these are as good as you've said, maybe I'll just mix the old bay into the tartar sauce.
