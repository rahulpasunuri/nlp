I used whole wheat spaghetti and it still turned out great. Who knew that greens would taste so good?

Good. Not great. No complexity of flavor. But then again, I wasn't expecting much given the ingredients list. For the simplicity of the meal, it is worth repeating. My family complained that the greens were bitter and they would have preferred spinach. It was easy to fix for a quick weeknight meal and cleanup was a snap.

Delicious! I was afraid it would be too boring but it was not at all. I doubled the pine nuts as some suggested, used bagged spinach and some watercress because it's what I had, and increased the garlic by a LOT and was very happy with the outcome! I followed all the other proportions egiven and it was perfect. I would even make this for casual company, perhaps topping with grilled chicken for the meat eaters. I love finding easy, yummy, healthy weeknight recipes like this.

This was soooo good! The flavor of the pine nuts was exceptional. I will definitely make this pasta again!

I made this last night with only a couple of additions.... Cut the recipe in half and used only a little bit of butter and oil. I used rapini/broccoli rabe for the greens and added some sun dried tomatoes and a few porcini mushrooms at the end. It was absolutely delicious. Next time I'd definately use more greens as they reduce dramatically. My husband and I both loved it! Will definately make again.

I thought this was yummy. I couldnt find italian greens so i used a head of radicchio, arugula and a ton of spinach. despite the fact that i used both radicchio and arugula it was not bitter. i doubled the pine nuts because i love them. also added red pepper flakes for some spice. my boyfriend thought it was great.

Delicious when cooked as per the recipe -- and an excellent way to get the salad-haters in your family to happily eat a big serving of greens. Definitely will make again as a fast weekday dinner.

I've made this recipe twice. The second time I used radicchio and spinich instead of the Mediterranean mixed greens and I was even more pleased with the reults. It is a great quick, healthy dinner.

My daughter has proclaimed this the best pasta dish she has ever had. The rest of our dinner party thought pretty highly of it as well. Something that easy shouldn't taste that good. Don't be afraid to use alot of greens, we used two 12 ounce bags of Italian salad greens and it certainly wasn't too much.

Really delicious and so easy! The flavors go together perfectly. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter and oil by a third, which turned out really well.

Delicious recipe.

Delicious. I made it just as the recipe instructs and my sister and I both loved it. Next time I may cut the butter and oil a little. I love the way the pine nuts nestle inside the penne.

very yummy. served it with some roasted tomatoes on the side. Probably will use a little less oil and butter next time.

This dish was great. I added some red pepper flakes to give it some spice, otherwise I followed the recipe. I think next time I will cut out 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil to tone down the fat content.

very easy and flavourful. careful with radiccio as it may turn everything pink if you "overwilt" it.

I love this recipe: easy, fast and delicious! I make the "sauce" as the pasta boils and substitute half of the Parmesean with Peccorino for more cheese flavor.

Good flavor and was quite suprised how good the wilted greens were in combination with the pasta. Husband and son thought there could have been some italian sausage added, but it was perfect the way it was. (They would add sausage to everything if I let them!)

The use of pine nuts really makes this dish. I loved the greens w/ the pasta. I used extra cheese and garlic.

This dish was certainly okay but not tasty enough to make again. I balked at the price of pine nuts and used walnuts instead. The combination of pasta and "cooked greens" didn't work, even with extra cheese.
