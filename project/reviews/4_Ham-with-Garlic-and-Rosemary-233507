Made this for 2012 New Years Celebration... it was sooo easy and everyone took some home. I used pepsi cola because that's what I had on hand. Am making it again for a funeral service tomorrow at the family's request. It's a winner.

I cooked it with apple juice and it was wonderful. And then I reserved the bone with a chunk of meat still attached and used it to make the Yellow Split Pea Soup. The taste of rosemary, garlic and apple gave the soup a rich and sophisticated flavour.

Wow, this is delicious. I was a little skeptical about this, but it turned out outstanding! everyone loved it! Super easy to make. I too used beer for liquid.

Truly a fantastic ham recipe that is so easy to do. I used beer as well, since I did not have apple juice and made no other changes. It looked fabulous and tasted even better. Everyone of my guests asked to take back some of the leftovers.

Well I was nervous to make this recipe with only one review. However, Christmas eve was very tasty with this recipe and was a great alternative to the traditional ham with pineapple. It was much more organic and very tasty. I paired this with prosciutto and parmesan mash potatoes and a light salad.

Talk about a showpiece on a platter! The rosemary sprigs tuck into the scores, the mustard- glaze turns a golden brown...it was gorgeous and tasted great! For the liquid, I used beer, as I didn't have any apple juice, and it was fantastic.
