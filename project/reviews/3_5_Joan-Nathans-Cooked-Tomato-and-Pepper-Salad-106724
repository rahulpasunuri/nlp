Oh, this was sooooo good. I used tomatoes-on-the vine that were actually pretty mealy - and the dish still turned out delicious. I didn't bother to peel the tomatoes. My husband said I outdid myself (wow what a compliment for such an easy recipe!). I served the salad with toasted pita bread for dinner, and then ate it again in the morning on a bagel! I'm addicted.

I made this a couple of nights ago and it turned out very well. I used quite a bit more pepper than tomato. Since tomatoes aren't great now (or pretty much ever where I live) I added about a 1/4 cup of good quality tomato paste. Toward the end of cooking, which I rushed a bit, I added a sprinkling of balsamic vinegar over all and turned up the heat until the mix began to brown ever so slightly. It worked great.

This recipe is quite delicious although I would not classify it as a salad; more like an accompaniment for meat or a topping for burgers. Wonderful flavor!
