I am going to try the dressing on Lobster, or shrimp, I also feel the dressing is too strong for the crab

Whoever wrote this recipe forgot the salt. Add salt and you should be able to taste all of this dish's many dimensions.

I'm not surprised at the one fork rating for this recipe. Throwing all of these ingredients on Dungeness crab ought to be a crime. Dungeness needs little or no enhancement except maybe a quick skip through a little melted lemon butter. Its sweet, toothsome meat is a revelation in and of itself. This lily needs no gilding.

I followed this recipe using high quality ingredients, fennel from Whole Foods, Dungeness crab, etc. The only thing I changed was I added a little more honey to the dressing. It was a little tart for me. I also followed the directions to a "T" and assembeled the salad as called for.....BUT we didn't think it was very good. Just sort of blah......... maybe it was the extra honey. I consider myself an excellent cook and when I saw this recipe using fennel (how can anything not taste good with this) and crab I figured let's give it a try. The dressing also sounded so good. I am anxious to read more reviews if anyone else trys this......it's not exactly cheap but I'm hoping someone can give me some tips to improve.
