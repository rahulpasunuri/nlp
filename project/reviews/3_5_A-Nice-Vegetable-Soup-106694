Absolutely loved it! I followed the instructions, including for the homemade stock, and added 3/4 cup orzo pasta for the last 10 minutes. Turned out fantastic! Will definitely make this again!

Subbed chopped garlic for minced and 2C quartered cherry tomatoes for plum tomatoes. I made this with "Fresh Vegetable Broth," also on Epicurious, and found it to be an exceptional combination. The soup has a perfect balance between the sweet, acidic tomatoes and fennel (complimented by the cloves in the broth) and the savory, broad flavors of the thyme and onion-families. Great for late summer thru early spring, but a bit too dense for summer.

like another reader, I used beef broth instead of veggie. I also added a half cup of dried barley, one sweet potato, peeled and cubed, and a box of frozen limas. Served it with cornmeal and cheddar scones--mmmm delicious!

I shamelessly admit I used this recipe by way of cleaning out the refrigerator. I used beef broth instead of vegetable, and half a container of DiGiorno Marinara Sauce in place of the tomatoes and herbs. It tturned out good--not a terribly fancy recipe, just a nice soup as the title says.

This soup has a great flavor to it. I used canned pear tomatoes as I didn't have fresh and it was delicious.

This was a very good soup. I made it with mixed chicken and duck stock rather than vegetable and added some black beans and pasta. With parmesan added to the soup bowls it was an excellent minestrone.

Great easy and simple recipe. This was my first soup and it turned out decent. My boyfriend was extremely happy and hopes that I make it again. I would spice it up a little bit with peppers and spices. This recipe is a great, basic veggie soup recipe.

On a rainy cool June day,this soup I made! It is lovely, very flavourfull and full of "good for you veggies". I did add a few diced potatoes and a portabella mushroom because it happened to have been in the fridge. Served it with homemade parmesan croutons and even my 9 year old who hates vegetables ate it up! (of course his I did have to puree). I skipped the leeks and used a small can of diced tomatoes and it worked great. Will make this one again!

im 13 and i made this recipe with no problems at all, great dish to make with kids (if their alowed to use a knife). i have a trick, instead of wilting the onions and celery right away wait intil everything is added that way you make all the flavors melt together. this soup is nice and light but still rich in flavor. this is a really superb soup

did not like this soup..found it to be very bland and way too garlicky. a big waste of time and good vegetables. added some hot sauce and extra boullion cubes to try to add flavor at the end....was just a touch better.

I made this soup for a friend who has just been diagnosed with liver cancer. I made it just as is except I omitted the fennel and cut back a little on the garlic. He absolutely loved it. I am glad he did since I made a double batch so he could freeze some.

This was a great recipe for a nutritious and flavorful vegetable soup. Didn't take too much time once all the vegetables were cut up. A nice balance of different vegetable. My guests loved it on a cold night.

A very good, hearty fall/winter soup - very flavorful. I did use the "Better Than Bouillon" Vegetable Base, instead of homemade vegetable stock (due to lack of time and patience)and it worked out great. I also didn't use the onion and added twice the zucchini, and used regular tomatoes, instead of plum.
