These were so yummy, and easy to make also. I used the frozen onions, and the whole milk. Will definitely be making this again!

This is an easy and great recipe that we loved for Thanksgiving this year. Definitely use the frozen onions and hide them once they're caramelized - we couldn't stop eating them! I'd also recommend caramelizing the onions in a nonstick pan if you have one. Surprisingly, I sticked to the recipe for the most part, except we had some duck fat from our turkey leg confit and I used that instead of the butter to make the roux for the bechamel. Shhhh... And loved it with the creme fraiche!

I used about 1 cup of the peas. We all enjoyed it. Easy to make and I will use it again!
