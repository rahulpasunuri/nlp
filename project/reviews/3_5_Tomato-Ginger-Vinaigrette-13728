This is so tasty. It went very well with the fillet, but it is so tasty that I'll make it for other dishes too.

We LOVED this sauce. We made it with the filet; reduced the olive oil by nearly half. We enjoyed it with leftovers for several days- it's great with grilled fish as well. This will be a staple in our kitchen all summer long!

Very nice vinaigrette. I used half artisan-made balsamic, half commercial and a quality fruity olive oil. I served it over vine-ripened tomatoes, avocados and hearts of palm. Made this as accompiament to an buffet dinner for 21. Everyone loved it. Maybe the other cook didn't like it due to inferior ingredients and improper preparation.

I have to admit, I was entrigued with the concept of the recipe, but was disappointed with the final product. I served it as a puddle of sauce under potato-crusted salmon filets. The consistency was the main problem, my helper dumped all ingredients (including oil) which resulted in a foamy over emulsified mixture. Maybe the result would have been better if prepared as directed - oil after ingredients are blended. In either case, the flavor also needed some "punching up". Added some cayenne and lemon... so so results, but worth another try because the idea sounds so good!
