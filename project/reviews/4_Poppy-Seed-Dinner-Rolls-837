I never made rolls before this. I wanted a special component to our Christmas Eve dinner. I followed recipe except needed to add additional flour to make a non-sticky dough. Everyone said they were the best rolls they ever had.

Good, but not exceptional. Rolls were buttery and soft, but nothing special. The overnight rise is definitely makes timing/planning a dinner party easier.

Best rolls ever. Making the dough the day before saved tons of time on Thanksgiving Day, too.

Perfectly light and buttery. I made these rolls sans poppy seeds for thanksgiving this year and I was surprised how many compliments they recieved. It was very convenient to make the dough the night before. I'll admit that I did forgo the complicated assembly for the easier cloverleaf style. It made for some really lovely dinner rolls.

A good roll best for more formal dinners. Choose this if you're looking for a excellent, soft, white (WonderBread-like) roll. However, if you want a roll with more character, look elsewhere. I found forming the fan-shaped rolls straight forward... a little bit time consuming but certainly not difficult. I also found it easiest to work the dough if it had been left out to warm up. The cold dough was too difficult to roll out thinly.

Double the recipe. You'll want leftovers. I've let these rise slowly overnight in the refrigerator with great success.

I've made these for two Thanksgiving dinners, and my family raves every time. They're really not as difficult as the recipe sounds - they just take a bit of time. Enjoy!

Amazing. Followed tip of reviewer who recommended short cut of rolling into balls vs. strip method. They were beautiful. If you want to avoid buttering muffin pans, aluminum cupcake cups worked great; the rolls slipped right out of the cups.

Rating: 3
I should have taken the advice of previous reviewers to make a simple cloverleaf shape - if I make these again (and I probably will), I will definitely skip the fanning technique, which was time-consuming and not as pretty as I would have liked. This is a very simple and satisfying recipe if you only have one day to prep before you make the rolls - if you happen have two days to prep, I strongly recommend the Cook's Illustrated recipe for Best American Dinner Rolls - you can you really taste the difference an extra day makes!

Baked these yummy rolls for Thanksgiving. Great flavor and easy to do! I especially liked the benefit of making the dough the day before. This recipe will become a regular at our Thanksgiving table!

These rolls reminded me of a brioche. I made them for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. I skipped the somewhat complicated business of rolling and fanning the dough and instead divided the dough into 24 balls, and those balls into three. I popped three balls of dough into each muffin cup and then allowed them to rise. They looked absolutely stunning with the egg wash and poppy seeds and I avoided a lot of needless work. I made the dough in the morning (8:00am) and refrigerated for 8 hours and then followed as directed...They were just in time for an evening meal. This is an excellent recipe. The rolls went exceptionally well with the butternut squash soup that I made to start off our meal. Try these.

The name of this recipe is quite an understatment. The recipe should be called Buttery Flaky Overnight Dinner Rolls. Although a bit time consuming, these rolls were the best I have ever made. I brought them to Thanksgiving and they were dipped in gravy and slathered with more butter and then they were gone. Use a food processor to combine the butter and flour and then use your mixer with the dough hook to further combine and knead the dough. The dough is very soft so add a bit more flour. The dough is done when it no longer clings to the sides of the mixing bowl. Lorraine

wow...just...wow. my first time making bread (although have made cinnamon rolls) and it was a hit. very soft, a cross between a roll and croissont. i did these with the bombay sliders recipe on this site and it disappeared! also mixed ingds together with a wooden spoon, and instead of kneading used the kitchenaid mixer with dough hook..sooo easy.

I made these for Christmas eve dinner. I couldn't refridgerate overnight so I just put the dough in a greased bowl and let it raise until double. It worked just fine. These were delicious, light and flaky. Everyone loved them.

Delicious addition to Thanksgiving this year. My first yeast dough but they turned out perfectly beautiful & delicious like I had been baking them for years. I did half with poppy seeds, half without for variety. YUM!

These rolls are delicious. I forgot that I needed to refrigerate the dough over night, so I just proceeded with the normal rising process and they worked out fine. I had trouble making the fans initially, not knowing exactly how to put them in the muffin cup. However, they turned out quite attractive. I formed half of the dough in clover leafs for variety and speed. Yummy and very rich. Go figure with all that butter!

Made these to take to a Thanksgiving dinner today. They came out great! They have a beautiful crust and buttery and fluffy inside. My boys love these even though they don't like bread. They are asking if we can bake these every Saturday along with the cookies. Will definitely make again!

As the holiday season approaches, I'm pulling out this recipe as I have for the past 10 years! It has become a tradition to make these rolls to be enjoyed by my family. Try them -- you won't be disappointed.

Fantastic! Made these for Easter dinner and everyone raved over them. I doubled the recipe, as another reviewer noted was possible, and they turned out perfectly. If you like making bread, this dough is a joy to work with. Doing the stacking feels a little time consuming at first, but after the first set you get the hang of it, and it goes much faster.

Very good recipe. The dough came together quickly and was fairly easy to work with. I rotated the pans halfway through baking to ensure even browning. Will definitely make again.

My oven didn't have the shelves at the right height according to the recipe so the tops got brown on the top tin before the insides cooked. All in all not enough crust and too much butter inside. Too fluffy, not my kind of dinner toll. Maybe I can cook one tin at a time to avoid the double tins in the oven problem.

Rating: 2
I had quite a problem having 2 pans in the oven at the same time, and my shelves were not at the specifications that are required in this recipe, so the top tins got burned on the tops quickly, and it was a real challenge having to open the oven and keep shifting them around. One tray didn't get done inside. All in all it wasn't worth it. I guess I could make only 12 at a time. The taste was good, but too much butter INSIDE the roll. I would rather put my own butter on and have a more dense roll. These are too fluggy inside. Also since they are in a muffin tin (I did the 3 balls in each suggestion) the bottoms are soft. I like a hard crusted french type roll. This was very soft without a crust except for the top. So I will continue my search!

Awesome rolls!! A bit of labor required here but well worth it! I actually forgot the last step of adding the Poppy seeds, but these fan butter rolls are still delicious. They came out looking and tasting just as if I purchased them at a professional bakery. My family was amazed that I baked them myself! This recipe is going in my list of favorites.

Rating: 4
These rolls are beautiful, look like they were bought from the bakery, and the technique is a little time-consuming but not difficult. The egg glaze browns beautifully. I followed all above instructions, except used two criss-crossing forks instead of a food processor to mix the butter in. Got many compliments at our Thanksgiving this year, and this was the first time I had ever mixed it all by hand instead of using a bread machine for yeast bread.

Forgot to also mention this is a recipe made easier by rolling into 3 balls for each roll.

Rating: 3
Very easy recipe (unlike a lot of other bread rolls) but definitely better if served warm instead of room temp. Pre-bake a few days ahead (as noted) but slightly under cook so when you reheat, it will become toasted but not dark. Also, if you have more than 25 people to serve (like I did on Thanksgiving) you might want to double the recipe so that you have enough for two servings for some and/or leftovers the next day. The poppy seeds don't add to the flavor too much but I like the look of the rolls and the slight crunch from the seed.

Rating: 3
These are just beautiful - definitely take the time to cut the rectangles & form fans, as the recipe suggests. It's actually quite a lot easier than it sounds, and the result is so elegant. I'd never attempted dinner rolls of any kind before, but these were really quite easy, if a bit time consuming. I don't have a food processor, so I just used a fork to combine the butter & dry ingredients, which worked well. I followed the recipe exactly, otherwise, and the rolls were a huge hit at my family's Thanksgiving. They were light and buttery, and were even compared to my great-grandmother's, which is the pinnacle of success in my family. Enjoy!

I was invited out to Thanksgiving dinner 2002 at a friend's house and at the last minute decided to bake. Checked Epicurious, of course, for a recipe. I love to bake cookies, cakes..but anything with yeast just never appealed to me...the waiting/rising & kneading!! Well, have I had a change of heart!! These are absolutely delicious. It took a little time to invision the layering technique, but well worth the small effort. We even re-heated them for breakfast the following morning. My daughter's a chef in Seattle and will be home for Christmas...so guess what I'm making again? Followed the receipe "as-is"; used non-stick muffin pans. Melt in your mouth buttery layered rolls - delicious!

These rolls are excellent! I followed another reviewers suggestion and rolled the dough into three ping-pong size balls and put them in the muffin pan. The doubled beautifully and baked just as well. I made them for Thanksgiving and Easter and everybody loved them. They freeze well and just need to be reheated at 350 for 10 min.

These should have been called Buttery, Rich, Poppy seed Rolls--delicious! I was pleasantly suprised that these turned out so well. I had to add much more flour than was called for and I didn't bother cutting them into strips. I just rolled them into 24 balls and placed them into a 13x9 inch pan. Because of the work and all that butter, you definitely want to save these as a special occasion bread.

What a wonderful little dinner roll. I just made a double batch of this recipe. (It doubles great.) In addition to using poppy seeds, I used sesame seeds on some and made other's plain. Oh, and forget all that rolling out and cutting jazz in the recipe. Just make small (golf ball-size) balls and put them in the muffin pans. They turn out the same, and are so much easier and quicker!

This was my first try at making rolls and it was easy. I don't have a food processor so I used my pastry cutter instead, it did the job just fine. I made these for some of my Egyptian nieghbors, they love them and now want me to teach them how to make them too.

These rolls tasted fine, but they really weren't anything special if you consider the amount of time it takes to make them. My dough was really sticky so I had to add a bunch of extra flour and I had let them rise and then put them in the fridge before I cooked them so that may have been why the results were not better.

Scrumptious! This was my first experience with making rolls of any kind. There was alot involved in the preparations, but the end product was definitely worth the effort. I served the rolls (without the poppy seeds) at a dinner party and everyone loved them. I will save this recipe forever. I didn't have a food processor, so I used two butter knives and sliced cross-wise through the butter and flour mixture. It worked just as well, cutting the dough into fine pieces. - A wonderful recipe.

These rolls were wonderful and easy to make. I made all 24. We ate half at dinner and I froze the rest. They were even better the next time we ate them. I was concerned that I didn't cut all the rectangles the same size but after baking them, it didn't matter. They looked and tasted great!

I cook a lot but when I get to dinner rolls, as opposed to French or Italian bread, I have always had mixed results. This recipe, however, is great -- easy to make and delicious. While the stacking and slicing of the rolled out dough makes for a beautiful fanned dinner roll, I am inclined to simply fill each muffin tin with three small balls of dough, but either way the recipe is great.
