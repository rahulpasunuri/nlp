I was not such a fan of this recipe - I don't think the pesto went well with the snap peas so altogether, the dish tasted "off". Everything else I served that meal got finished but there were leftovers of this dish that never got eaten.

I accidentally put a bit too much salt and didn't have more parsley to dilute, so I used some fresh cilantro instead which worked out quite well.

I like this recipe a lot for the ease with which it is cooked and it's a delightful salad to go with fish and chicken.

The taste of the pesto is kind of overshadowed by the taste of the peas, so the pesto is stronger with the potatoes. If you like snap peas, this is not at all a bad thing.
