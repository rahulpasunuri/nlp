Delicious!! I have never made risotto before so I followed the recipe closely - except I used vegetable broth and short grain BROWN rice - which took MUCH longer than 18 minutes - more like 35 - to get to al dente. Amazing part = the turnips held their shape and flavor for that long. But my baby greens (kale and swiss chard) were cooked to bits. Next time I might add them later in the process. But the flavor was wonderful! A real crowd pleaser.

forget about the turnip greens, add kale!

This was great! Like the other reviewers, I stuck in some butter and a whole lot of cheese at the end. My turnip didn't come with greens, but I was in the mood for some, so I threw in some spinach with the last portion of stock. Delicious!

This recipe really is a simple, good-tasting way to use items that are actually in season at your local farmer's market. It's a perfect fall weeknight supper, especially with the addition of a handful or two of grated simple farm cheese, preferably one that's hard and a bit salty (a little like Parmesan). To me, that gives this interesting fusion dish a final but subtle Southern coda. Like several other reviewers, I tend to think that it gets better with just a touch more of the bacon, but this is a matter of personal preference and also depends on the size of your turnips (mine were fairly large). Make sure to use good chicken stock, good bacon ... good everything. And buy local!! :)

I made some changes to this to suit my family's taste. Increased the bacon, added a good amount of parmesan to the risotto (not just as a garnish) and added roasted asparagus as our turnips did not come with greens. With the adjustments, it was very tasty and satisfying. A good way to use the farm share turnips.

This is one of the two best risottos I have EVER made. Using fresh young turnips works perfectly. The balance is delightful and the turnips cook to a gentle flavor perfectly in harmony with the bacon flavor and the fresh parmesan. WOW!

Great use for turnips and greens. I make the recipe as is and enjoy it every time.

Simple and satisfying, not spectacular. I had an abundance of turnips from my CSA, this recipe was a good way to use some up.

This was okay - but without the bacon, it would have been a pretty bland dish. That said, the leftovers were pretty darn tasty. I think the bacon grease leaking into the risotto overnight flavored it VERY well. I think that means it might be better if prepared ahead of time and reheated for the meal...

Nice flavors. I thought the turnips worked surprisingly well in risotto. I added a little white wine and parmesan cheese as suggested by previous reviewers. I would be careful with the amount of cheese in the future because it was a little too rich with the cheese and the bacon.

I used this recipe mainly because I had turnips/greens to use. I had no bacon, so I used scallions ; mixed in some cheese at the end- did it in the slow cooker. Tasty.

I have been making this risotto for several years now and I think it's great. It helped me learn to love both turnips and turnip greens. I do typically add more than a what I would consider a garnish of parmigiano, however, as in most traditional risotto recipes.

I really liked this risotto. The turnip taste is recognizable but not too strong and with the bacon makes a nice hearty taste.

I really liked this recipe. The bacon and turnips (with greens) were a great combination. I did heed one reviewer's thoughts on the normal addition of wine in risotto. Instead of adding wine after the rice, I added about 1/3 C of beer. I think a dry sherry would work just as well. I also added the turnips in three additions so the parts didn't overcook. First, I added the diced root, then halfway through the cooking process, I added the chopped stems, and finally added the sliced leaves when there was about 5 minutes of cook time left. Just before serving, I added a small handful of shredded parmesan, and about a tablespoon of butter.

This recipe is not that good. I think that the bacon ruines the dish. I did not like the association bacon-turnip.

This was surprisingly good and easy. I followed the recipe exactly and my only complaint is that it made more than two servings!

This was absolutely delicious, although I did doctor it a bit: I added about 3/4 cup grated parmesan and a tablespoon of butter when the rice was fully cooked. It's just not risotto without those flavors. Also, creaminess of risotto comes as much from stirring as from liquid: sounds like the complaining reviewer didn't stir enough.

This recipe did not turn out well. The consistency was not like risotto at all - it was more like a rice pilaf with some cheese sprinkled on it. I think turnip is such a hard vegetable and draws so much water that it absorbed too much broth and thus the arborio couldn't become as plump as usual and the dish didn't develop that rich creaminess. I also missed the little bit of wine usually used in risotto. I wouldn't recommend the recipe to anyone and I definitely won't make it again.

This is improbably good. The peppery sweetness of the turnips is well matched by the smokey sweetness of the bacon. This seems to me a distinctly American take on risotto -- as though some South Carolina cook had been let loose on the Arborio -- but I say that only in praise.
