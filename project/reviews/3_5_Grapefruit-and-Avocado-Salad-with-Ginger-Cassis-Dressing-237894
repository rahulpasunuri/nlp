Easy to make and would never have guessed to put this together on my own. Suggest only using one large grapefruit. Served it to company who loved it.

So simple and delicious! My dinner guests loved it! I had never used Creme de Cassis, and it is so great! This is definitely a summer keeper.

The dressing does it!! Used grenadine, and followed recipe except after peeling the grapefruit, separated the segments to match the shape of the avocado slices and so eliminated the "casings." Beautiful presentation!

I prepared the salad to introduce my parents to new ways of preparing old favorites. Having always liked avocado and grapefruit, the suggestion was well-received. We could not find black-currant liqueur, instead we used grenadine. Needless to say, the salad had a great textural mix, and the dressing truly was a delicious surprise! Looking forward to trying the liqueur next time.

I was skeptical about the cassis, and because of so many other reviewers including pomegranate ingredients, I made this recipe following all ingredients exactly except substituted 1 tbsp Pomegranate Glaze (from Trader Joes) for all of the cassis, and upped the vinegar to compensate for the additional acid. I love the combination of flavors in this salad.

I served this along with the poached eggs with asparagus and prosciutto ham as a great, light brunch. The dressing had just the right hints of sweet and spice.

This was one of the best dressings I have made, although I did use only half of the ginger in deference to guests who may not have liked ginger as much as we do. It was refreshing and light. I am using the recipe again with orange and grapefruit segments, no avocado but adding pomegrante seeds for the holidays

Spectacularly mediocre, disjointed and confused. The grapefruit's only positive contribution was to lend some color to the salad, as its flavor conflicted with just about every other ingredient. The alcohol in the creme de casis led to an unbalanced dressing. Frankly I'm incredulous that so many people rated this recipe so highly.

I have made this many times since discovering the recipe. The dressing is wonderful. I always make it with the cassis, as I think that is the vital ingredient. It MAKES the recipe!

I thought the flavors was so refreshing but my husband didn't care for it. Must be a personal taste thing. I'd definitely make it again on a day that the husband is not coming home for dinner.

I love this salad. Exceptional dressing. I did not have creme de cassis or grenadine so I made my own grenadine by bringing equal amounts of "Pom" pomegranate juice and sugar to a boil and then simmering for 15 minutes. Since discovering this recipe I make it all the time.

I have made this salad three times for company in the past two weeks. Everyone loves it. I might try it with the seived blackberries another time.

This is a nice combination that I have used before, but the dressing made it a standout. I didn't have cassis handy, but I did have fresh blackberries which I sieved to equal 3 T. liqueur. I also put some fresh blackberries on the plate. Worked like a charm.

My boyfriend's mom has been making this for years! She makes it without the ginger-cassis dressing however. It's very tasty and the only bad part is that the lettuce never gets eaten because the grapefruit-avocado combo is so delish!
