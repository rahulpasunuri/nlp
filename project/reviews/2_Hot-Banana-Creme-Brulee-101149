Read all the reviews... they say everything. There is a restaurant here in towm that does a lovely banana creme brulee. After much trial and error, I think I have figured out the secret. Use any of the vanilla creme brulee recipes on the site (I used the black and white and just used the vanilla base minus 1 yolk) and steep one organic banana in the heavy cream for 15 minutes. The subtle taste of banana comes through in the final product, without comprising the texture of the custard. When plating, I thinly sliced another banana and placed the rounds ontop the custard and then put sugar on top of the banana before putting a flame to it. Delish!

Yuk--this doesn't even deserve one fork. I agree with many others that the consistency was bread-like, not at all like a pudding. And, the taste was bland at best. Definitely won't make again.

This dessert tasted like a smoothie that had been heated. It had a thick, bread-like consistency and nothing about it seemed or tasted like creme brulee.

A dreary, victorian workhouse recipe. This was the last time I'll ever make a recipe with so many 1-fork reviews. The texture is more a bland bread pudding than a creme brulee. I was also unable to get an even caramelization.

I saw the mixed reviews and decided someone was right and some were'nt. Well as a serious home cook, I must say that this was in no way a creme brulee. It was creme brute! Now if they had billed this as a banana souffle then more people would have liked it despite the ingredients not being that of a souffle. The large amount of banana in this ratio of yolk and cream make it more like the texture of souffle or half baked banana bread. You cant get too creamy with so much fruit that has a high water and fiber content. It tastes fine but do not think this is a creamy custard. It is not. I am now on a search for a GOOD banana creme brulee recipe. If I find one, I'll let you know here.

What an embarrasment this was! I told a friend I'd cook her dinner, and BLECH!-- Dessert was a joke! Totally agree with the poster who said to go with vanilla creme brulee and maybe top it with banana's. This was terrible!

This recipe was a big dissappointment. I had a Banana Foster Creme Brulee at a famous restaurant in Cape Cod. This one tasted nothing like it. The texture was too thick and the lemon juice was too strong. I would recommend just making a basic vanilla creme brulee. Just before serving, place thinly slice bananas and sugar over the top. Then place under the broiler or use a blow torch.

The flavor was good but this did not turn out to be like a creme brulee. I agree with the other reviewer who said the texture was too heavy. I won't be making it again.

Creme Brulee and Bananas Foster are my favorite desserts, and this recipe is a perfect combination! Not only that, but it is embarrassingly easy to make. What more could one ask for?! (Just make sure the bananas are ripe)

My husband & I loved this recipe! We both like bananas so naturally we will be having this one a lot from now on. I am so glad I found this web site! I have tried several of the recipes and will be trying more in the future. Keep up the good work!!

The finished product was too thick, even after we substituted light cream for all of the heavy cream called for in the recipe. Tasted more like banana mousse than creme brulee or custard.
