I didn't really like this salad, I found the grapefruit to be overpowering and bitter and the salad on a whole to be quite tasteless, its too bad because it sounded really tasty. I made it again and added fresh yellow and red peppers and took out the grapefruit and it was a little better

light and tasty and it just feels healthy! i used mache as the greens and instead of the white wine vinegar, i used some ginger rice vinegar i had on hand.
