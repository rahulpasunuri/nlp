Wonderful and flaky! The only reason I did not give it 4 forks is because I found it absolutely delicious, but not exceptional. I loved it, but did not find myself gasping in delight over it. I found the dough a bit tricky to roll out-- It helped to roll it out between 2 sheets of wax paper-- Great recipe.

This is a great dough recipe--probably the most tender I've ever tried. It also is very flavorful. I made it for the pear tarte tatin that it appeared with. I ended up chilling it on top of the pears before baking so that I could serve it warm after a dinner, inadvertently following the previous reviewers' advice. It didn't shrink, so I'm inclined to agree this is the way to go.

Works great. I agree with all the stuff the reviewer just before me said: the dough will shrink less if you chill it a while before baking. And rolling it out between two sheets of plastic wrap is a very good idea; this dough is very moist and sticky. Very tender, though, and not hard to make.

This makes a very good crust -- tender and flaky. I find the key is to freeze the fats and to roll it out between sheets of plastic wrap, that way you don't have to worry about it sticking to the rolling pin and you don't need to use any flour. And, chill it before baking (helps prevent shrinkage).
