I threw in the fresh thyme springs when cooking the vegetables. It's easier to remove the leaves once they have cooked - they almost fall off the sprigs, saves time. Fingers taste better too. Toasted Quinoa bread sliced in the toaster then cubed and tossed with a nutty olive oil. Quick, very simple, Very Good. Thanks Bon Appetit.

We made this stuffing to go with our Thanksgiving turkey, and it was very tasty! A big hit with everybody. We used less olive oil and butter than called for, and didn't miss it. Will definitely make again.

This is the best stuffing recipe I've tried. I've been making this since it first showed up in the November 2006 issue of Bon Appetit. I use a loaf of round Italian Bread, I make no adjustments to the amount of oil and I always bake uncovered as I like stuffing with some crunch.

I had a hankering for Thanksgiving in May so I made turkey breast and this stuffing. I took advice from Atlanta cook and halved the oil and baked without a cover. I also added sage. It was a nice stuffing, not quite mom's.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was very good. I doubled the recipe and used one loaf of country wheat bread and one of marbled rye and I also left on the crusts. I think that these bread textures made a big difference. Mine was crispy on top and still had a nice crunch to the celery (extra) as well.

I used a good Ciabatta bread, believing bread quality to be important. I did not trim off bottom crust, believing the crust to be the best part! I substituted red for green pepper, but concluded neither pepper added much. Next time I'll make without pepper and add dried cranberries for color instead. This was not mushy at all, but very tasty, and I will make it again.

Prejudices in favour of cornbread aside, this recipe was a huge disappointment. If you prepare as directed, you will end up with soggy bread, just as the last person said. Mine tastes like someone mushed up a bell-peppers-on-white-bread sandwich then poured a little soup over it. Ew.

i added some sage in with the bread cubes and some fresh chives in before the final baking. i also mixed red peppers in with the green, which added some nice color. i 'm not sure if these substitutions and additions made a huge difference, but i loved this stuffing.

A good recipe for taste, but some problems. Halve the oil and, while the final mix is in the oven, do not cover - rather, cook uncovered with top heat for 45 minutes and stir occasionally. Following the recipe will lead to soggy breadcrumbs...
