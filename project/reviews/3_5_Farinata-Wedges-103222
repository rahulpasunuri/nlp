I had an outstanding version of farinata at the wonderful wine bar, Soif, in Santa Cruz, CA. Spoke to the chef about it and he urged letting the mixture rest 3 hours rather than one.

I was looking for a good recipe to use for some chickpea flour (besan) I picked up at my local Indian market. This one is it - not only is it really easy, it makes a great alternative to bread, rice, pasta, and/or other starches. I have also made it as an appetizer for guests - the farinata takes well to all sorts of dips. I have always followed the advice of letting the batter sit at least an hour - I think this is really critical to having the dish come out correctly.

Being that this is the second farinata recipe that I've tried here, I must say the same: This is an easy, tasty, and healthy snack to serve for lunch or as a light dinner. Definitely worth making!

This is so simple and quick, as long as you remember to let the batter sit the hour.

I love this recipe. It turns out great if you use a cast-iron skillet. I prefer that the Farinata Wedges are drier than what is produced following the original recipe, so I tend to cook them longer. Also, I like it best if I turn the "finished product" over and broil/toast the underside for a few minutes. The batter freezes well. Believe it or not, these wedges are great with "all fruit" preserves or spread. I eat it with St. Dalfour's Black Raspberry 100% Fruit. This recipe is a great alternative for people, like me, who cannot eat wheat.
