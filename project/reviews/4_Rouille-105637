This is one of the best sauces I've ever tasted. I like to add about 1 tablespoon of Harissa, a Moroccan spice blend.

An outstanding recipe... I just can't get enough. A simple addition that makes this sauce even better is the Moroccan spice blend "Harissa". Just 1 tablespoon is enough, provided you like the spice. We only have panko bread crumbs at our restaurant, and these seem to work fine as well.

a beautiful vegetarian rouille (traditionally rouilles are made with fish stock). i used cayenne powder instead of the fresh jalepeno and one slice fresh white bread instead of crumbs (cut off the crust, soak in water, squeeze out as much water as possible before blending). i then fried up some garlic and artichoke hearts, added the rouille and used it as a pasta sauce.

Very good but I always thought that rouille was a kind of mayonaisse and thus had egg yolk in it?

This is excellent - I will use this as a simple appetizer with toasted baguette brushed with olive oil! Perfect match for the fish soup- makes the dish. Would also be wonderful with fried calamari.
