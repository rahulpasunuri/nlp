I thought blue cheese mashed potoatoes sounded like a perfect side dish to the tenderloin I was planning to serve at my next dinner party. I am glad I tried this recipe out ahead of time, because I didn't like it at all. It just tasted "off" to me. There are better ways to jazz up mashed potatoes.

I agree with the first reviewer - this is wonderful. The flavors are so subtle and it is so easy to prepare. I made it with a Brine-crued Pork Chop recipe from BA 9/01. Excellent menu.

I have been using this recipe for the past 3 years. It is fabulous! The subtle flavor of the celery root (for those who haven't used before, I find it in the produce section of my supermarket - it really is the root of a stalk of celery), combined with the blue cheese is so unique. It's a great change from the garlic mashed potatoe craze. Be sure you cut the celery root small enough so you don't end up with lumps!
