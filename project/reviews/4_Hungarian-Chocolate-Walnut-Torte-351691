Excellent recipe and so easy to make. I used semi sweet chocolate and did not make the icing. Delicious!

We all loved this recipe including our 12 guests. Very moist and great texture. Used all semisweet chocolate and chocolate icing which was very forgiving with the small pitting on the top. Very easy and am making again for another dinner party.

The texture of this cake was lovely, but the taste was uninspiring. I think it could have benefited from something like grated orange peel to give it some interest.

I made this for my friends' seder and it was a big hit! I didn't have my food processor with me, so I used a spice grinder to grind the nuts/sugar/matzo meal. It was a little too small to handle the whole amount at once, so I did it in batches and then combined bits of each batch in the grinder again to get everything consistent. I'd never worked with fresh ground nuts before, so I was a little put off at first at how moist and clumpy the mixture seemed. But it blended fine into the rest of the batter. I topped it with the chocolate glaze. The cake was moist, delicious, and just the right amount of gooey. Definitely a keeper!

As my Oma was Hungarian and my Mom Viennese, I grew up with nut tortes as part of our Seder. This recipe was denser than those of my childhood but was none-the-less a big hit with our crowd. I served plain = just sprinkled with confectioner's sugar and some grated chocolate!

Made this recipe for Passover last year. Was a big hit. I plan to make it again this year!

I only made the icing from this recipe to drizzle on top of a chocolate fudge cake. I substituted the water for Kahlua and mmmm!!!! more flavor and adds a hint of dark chocolate taste. So tasty :o)

This was the most delicious dessert I have ever made. The only change I made was to add about 3/4 tsp. of vanilla.

Outstanding dessert. I made it the night before, then served it with nondairy whipped topping and it was irresistible. Used ground walnuts (available in the Passover foods aisle of the supermarket) because I don't have a food processor.

This recipe has a lot in common with Julia Child's famous reine de saba (Queen of Sheba) cake, including its light creamy texture and glossy icing. Next time I'll try making it with almonds and with some coffee in the icing, but it's very good the way it is. Definitely doesn't taste like a Passover cake. It wasn't a disaster because the cake balanced it out, but I did discover that the pareve margarine I used for the icing was quite salty and thus the icing was rather salty too. Better to use unsalted if you can find it.

I made this for my seder. It was my very first seder that I did all on my own. This was definitely the highlight of the meal. Thank you to Judy Abrams.

Not usually a big cake fan and wanted to make a dessert for Passover that wouldn't remind us of the 40 years in the desert. This recipe worked out perfectly. Very easy to make. Did not improvise on the directions, made day before, and let sit a day covered in plastic. Result was a decandently rich, moist cake that I would enjoy eating anytime of year. And, man, was this good for breakfast the next day. Use high quality chocolate, as the flavor is front and center. Note that the texture of the cake is heavily impacted by how finely you grind the walnuts.

(sorry for the double post - apparently it takes the site awhile to put them up, so at first it looks like it didn't work)

Really delicious. I used almonds instead of walnuts. To make it pareve, I used cocoa powder + margarine + sugar. For pareve frosting: non-dairy creamer + cocoa powder + sugar, and potato starch to thicken.

cocoa powder + margarine instead of chocolate (Hershey's Special Dark means the torte comes out pretty much black) -> for the frosting: Mocha Mix brand non-dairy creamer (most others actually have a small amount of dairy) plus cocoa powder, sugar, and potato starch to thicken. Bring to a boil and down again, whisking constantly. I'm clicking "yes" on the "would you make it again" box, because I've already been asked to make it again next year!

I'm not a dessert fan but the Hungarian Chocolate-Walnut Torte caught my eye so I had to try this recipe. I paired it with a vintage port and it was an exquisite pairing to say the least!
