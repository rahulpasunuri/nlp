I think not as high quality ingredients might have something to do with some of the poor results. First, store bought canned chicken stock will ruin any recipe that depends upon it as the main star of a sauce. I actually substituted homemade mushroom stock for the chicken. I added some ginger, extra garlic, and red pepper flakes. I also added a few dashes of sesame oil at the finish. Turned out fantastic. Delicate, delicious, not too much, not too little. I am a phan.

Agree with not enough oomph. Added finely chopped Birdseye chilis when cooking the prawns. Also used brown instead of normal sugar, doubled garlic. I didn't add Soy sauce as I think that overpowers all the other flavors. Also, served in Thai style rice instead of plain.

Added the chili flakes, soy sauce, and chili sauce as others had suggested, and came out with an extremely bland dish. Don't bother.

Delicious, good for the novice cook! Tasty and on the healthier side :)

Super yummy dish! I used twice as much bok choy simply because I had it and having the extra stir fry sauce was nice. I agree with the other review that it needed some "Omph" so I also added a little chili flakes and some soy sauce. I like my sauces thicker, so I also did the cornstarch/water thing to thicken it a bit.

O.K., I'm a fan of Phan, but this simple middle of the week dish was lacking the simplistic "oomph!" that I expect from him. It was good, but not great. Needed more seasoning, maybe crushed red pepper. And why make so much stir fry sauce if you are only going to use 1/3 cup?
