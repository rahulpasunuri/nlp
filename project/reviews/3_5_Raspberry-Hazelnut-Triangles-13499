I have been making these for years. The yield is definitely off; have never managed to squeeze 8 dozen out of the recipe; maybe I'm not rolling them out thin enough. To make the cutting less messy, I do it with a pizza cutter BEFORE spreading the jam and nuts - it makes it a lot easier to see the shapes, and the knife (or cutter) doesn't get all gunked up with the jam and nuts.

These were the first Christmas cookies I made as an adult, without my mom. I had just graduated from university in 1995 and was living in San Francisco and barely had a functioning kitchen. My sister was having a Christmas party, which was basically a keg party in a house that had a pool table in the dining room. Amongst the Doritos and store bought cookies these were a major standout, but I was too embarrassed to claim credit because when you're 21 baking isn't really all that cool. But now, I make these specifically because I know people are going to be effusive in their praise, and as a baker or chef, isn't that always wonderful?

I thought this recipe was great just as is though I used strawberry jam because I was out of raspberry, but they were still delicious. I used a pie crust cutter (crimper?) to cut the dough into triangles and it gave it a nice zig-zag decorative edge to the cookie. Will definitely make this again.

These came out ok, but I have had much better success with the recipes from the cookbook COOKIE DOUGH DELIGHTS. MUCH easier and taste better!

These aren't bad, but I found that the jam and nut topping works just as well as filling for the jelly bowl cookies, which I also made today. I think you get a nicer texture with the jelly bowls - this preparation is kind of thin. But they weren't bad!

These sound simple and ho-hum but were sublime. I made a few different delicious types of Christmas cookies, for 2 separate groups and these were everyone's favorite, both times. The cookie is buttery and scrumptious and the jam slightly caramelizes on top. I couldn't disagree more with the cook from Vancouver. The only change I would make is to add slightly more hazelnuts. Beware, it is difficult to tell when they are lightly brown and done because of the jam..

These cookies were delish! I made them today for one of my kinds of Christmas cookies and they looked and tasted wonderful. I also made large star cut outs and covered them with the raspberry jam and then used a smaller star and put that on top, omitting the nuts, (my son is allergic) and then sprinkled with powdered sugar after they came out of the oven. Also made two large star cutouts and made sandwiches, with a smaller star cut out of the top. The jam becomes nice and chewy, it's a pretty satisfying cookie! This is a keeper!

I made these with heart shaped cutouts for Valentine's Day - a lot of work, but I enjoyed the rave reviews. I had trouble finding hazelnuts and so used almonds which also worked well. Have to agree with the last reviewer only in the fact that I used more jam and nuts than specified.

not such a tasty cookie... if you like a weight watchers wafer, this is the cookie for you, also, the recipe definately falls short of amount they say it will make not to mention flavor. If you still decide you must try it, we recommend that you double the jam and add more chopped hazelnuts as well. overall, we at womancan were very much disappointed. oh well.....

This cookie was a breeze to make. It makes a wonderful alternative to a Linzer Torte for dessert. It was a definite crowd pleaser at our Christmas table!

I first made this recipe for Christmas '95 - they were fantastic! Rich, buttery and very berry. They are easy and look striking with their redish color and triangluar shape.
