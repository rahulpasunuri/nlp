Wanted to make cookies for a last minute gift and I loved that I didn't need to pull out the mixer and a bunch of other equipment. I used non-stick foil and a glass to press cookies flat. I could see experimenting in the future with different nuts/extracts but these are already pretty yummy as written.

These are marvelous! I put crushed peppermint candies on top instead of pistachios. Also I've been making multiple batches because it doesn't make much, and I go through them really quick.

Upon reading the reviews, it seemed to me that this recipe was somewhat hit-or-miss. I guess I hit because they came out beautiful. I did make a few minor adjustments based on the reviews. I used 70% bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened, switched out the almond extract for coffee extract, walnuts for pistachios (much prefer walnuts anyway), smoked sea salt for kosher, used a rubber glove to spread the cookies and lined my sheets with parchment. Method was otherwise the same. They came out chewy as oppose to crispy, but I love chewy, so this wasn't a problem. Neither did I have sticking issues when it came time to transfer them to a cooling rack. My only issue is that they're horrendously addictive. I'm not sure why others are having such a time of it.

Oh my days. This was a tragedy. Haha. I did everything by the recipe and popped those suckers in the oven. Within 5 minutes, they turned to goop all over the place, so I just figured that was the "thins" part of it. Only 1/3 of the "cookies" came off the baking sheet in a dried, whole cookie shape. I was told that they were delicious though. Good luck and beware.

Eh, nothing that fabulous. They did not hold together well. Maybe 1/2 tsp would have been better. Batter is yummy!

these cookies are great. I doubled the vanilla instead of adding almond extract. Also, instead of nuts I used crushed candy canes to make them more festive. I baked on parchment paper and used a spoon to flatten into circles as another reviewer suggested.

This recipe is incredibly easy and the results are fantastic! The cookie is very rich in taste, however, so if you don't like dark chocolate, it might not be for you.

These are simply delicious. And so easy and quick to whip up. The unfortunate part is that I tasted more than I should have so I had to whip up another batch.

These are delicious...delicate but worth the effort. They were perfect with tea and coffee served after the non-chocolate dessert. The tricky part is getting them to squish evenly!

One MAJOR issue: The cookies were hard as a brick making it so difficult to chew! The batter was delicious - tasted just like brownie batter - and the cookie did taste like a brownie top - just a brownie top inspired by the hardness of a brick.

This was a very tasty cookie. I give it high marks for novelty and creativity in creating a cookie that tastes like brownie top. It took me some fiddling and experimenting to find the right combo of batter/flattening/cooking time, as using generous teaspoons yielded cookies too big to fit 12 per pan, but I figured it out. This was more time consuming than the average cookie recipe (I made many more than 24 cookies so it was a lot more flattening, sprinkling etc.), so I don't think it will be my everyday recipe, but I really enjoyed it and I'm sure I will make it again.

I made these exactly as written, very easy, very chocolatey. I love all the ideas posted here. I, too, used the back of the spoon to spread the cookies and did not need the plastic wrap.

These are easy and delicious. I wanted to make brownies with nuts, but one of my guests can't eat nuts, so I was happy to find this individual brownie recipe. I left out the almond extract and put in 1/4 tsp. of brewed coffee instead. I lined the cookie sheets with parchment paper. Instead of all that bother with plastic wrap, I used a rubber scraper to spread the cookies thinner. I topped some of them with chopped pecans. I plan to serve them along with vanilla ice cream topped with homemade fudge sauce. Yummo!

The brownie thins were tasty, but they break very easily. Mine did not look nearly as pretty as the picture. If you're looking for something sturdy that will transport, you might be better off with something else.

These were fantastic, and I will absolutely make them again (maybe tomorrow, and the next day). Very simple and quick, however if you want to make them even more quickly use parchment paper (they slide right off) and don't bother with the plastic wrap, just use the back of a spoon; spreading it out in circular motions from the center to the edges. Next time I make them I think I would use slightly less vanilla and almond extract because they really over power the chocolate. I would also chop up dark chocolate to sprinkle on top with the pistachios.

Very tasty and delicate. Had to triple to make enough for a ballet school event -- where they were very popular.

Rating: 3
great for relatively simple recipe! I pressed my down very very thin(with plastic wrap) and baked for a few extra minutes and they came out crispy and fine. it helps to put only small spoonfuls of batter per cookie and make sure they are the recommended 2 1/2 inches wide before baking.

Rating: 3
Tasty... but i cooked these an extra 2 minutes and they were still gooey inside. I also think I'd halve the almond extract or do away with it altogether as it ended up being too potent in my brownie thins.

I thought these were excellent. I am hearing people saying they are disappointed that they didn't come out crispy. Mine didn't either, they were soft with a sort of crispy edge. I thought that tasted more like a brownie than a crispy cooke would have. I'm not sure they need to be any crispier, at any rate. I didn't find them greasy or hard to make. I left out the nuts, because I don't like nuts with chocolate. I used the unsweetened chocolate, and thought they were great, but I LOVE dark chocolate. If you're not really really into dark chocolate, use some other kind for sure. I actually wanted to try making them with white chocolate, which I also love, for kicks and giggles. As far as the plastic wrap drama, it's not necessary. They flatten on their own. Finally, I did not get anywhere near to 24 cookies, which was good, because we are only two people, so it makes no sense to make more than that, but if you are baking for a crowd, you might want to double the recipe.

I really enjoyed these brownie thins. I did make a few changes. I ommitted the almond extract and went with 1/8 tsp of peppermint instead. I also added candy cane bits to the top. Also, I lined the cookie sheet with non-stick alum foil. I also used waxed paper to press down the scoops of batter. It seemed to work the best, as long as you slowly lifted up the wax paper.

these didn't even make it to the rack to cool down. We ate them all in 5 minutes flat! Very quick and easy to make. Don't bother with the plastic film, just stick to the spoon. Yumm!

I followed the recipe and prep instructions precisely. I feared these would be mushy and greasy but no, they baked fine in 7-8 minutes.These cookies were lovely, crisp, rich, and held up days later. Don't fix what isn't broken? They are now, along with Viennese crescents, cinnamon sables, Gourmet's 1995 butter cookie recipe, and mini black and whites my holiday staples.

forgot to mention a basic, never buttered a pan because it burns, to 'butter' means to grease and use Crisco always. What fun!

When I saw the consistency of the dough I thought 'no way' will I try any kind of wrap to flatten these! Knew the mess I was going to make. Used the back of the spoon and that worked well.Used semi sweet chocolate and walnuts, because that was on hand. 7 min. was perfect and didn't really know to expect lace cookies! Will shape them into tuiles next time and use orange extract. My husband and I enjoyed them. Merry Christmas!

The parchment paper is a great idea! I also used it instead of the more difficult plastic wrap to flatten the thins. I also used mint in the cookie & crushed peppermint candy for the topping.Festive for the holidays.Also serving "hint" great crumbled over a good vanilla ice cream!

OK. I've heard a few people say already that they didn't come out the way they thought they should (mushy, greasy, etc.). So, how do we get them to be a cookie while remaining faithful to the attempt to re-create the oh-so-delicious brownie top (now that I've just broken my vow to keep forum-type conversations in the forums)? HELLO Fair Haven neighbor!--love the beach, the bluffs, and the pier up the there at your state park.

I really loved the taste of these! I didn't change the recipe. I used the almond extract and thought it turned out great; but I bet mint would be lovely also. I took the advice of another baker and just banged the cookie pan down on the counter rather than use the plastic to flatten. Cook time was perfect as well as the amount it makes.

These are very tasty but take longer to bake. I used parchment paper instead of buttering the pan. I spread them out with the spoon. even after 12 minutes the onesw in the middle wee too soft to handle. i also used 70% chocolate that was slightly sweetened. But they taste great...

I found these easy to make and delicious. I subbed mint extract for the almond and used walnuts instead of pistachios. Also used the back of a flat spatula instead of the plastic wrap. I think the mint adds a lot of life to the cookies.

I didnot butter my baking sheets (they are coated). I patted the cookies flat with a spoon and it worked fine. They baked for 15 minutes and still were mushy and never got to be cookies. The taste is fine and we used it as a crumb topping for ice cream and a fruit compote. Everyone loved the flavor. So, I might make them again for a topping or use less butter and more flour and try to do a cookie.

All those complainers have simply set me up for the challenge! Can't wait to make them. Hello, Bluff Point NY neighbor.

these are adorable and delicious...i had no trouble preparing them, not to sound prissy. keep in mind girls, a lot of times on these sorts of sites i think bakers/chefs sometimes add things too make it more cook saavy (ie extra steps or technique) that are not needed, and then seeming harder or confusing us. you dont need to press down with plastic wrap...they flatten out on there own. if they dont bang the pan on the top of your counter once they are all on. also, i did not like the unsweetened choc the first time. as i said before, 'up-ity' bakers use unsweetened choc to make things more rich and it doesnt, it makes it chalky. i used semi sweet the second time and loved them. merry christmas and happy eats!

This was so easy, and if you want to simplify, use parchment, sprinkle lots of chopped pistachios, use a rubber glove and press down on the nuts...it works! They were great.

I haven't tried this recipe yet. It sounds interesting. By the way, I thought this was a recipe review area, not a forum. Take the bickering there, please.

I do have a silpat and I baked about 1/2 of them on that. They still don't taste like much and are sorta greasy. I tried pressing one batch down with parchment and they stuck to the paper. It's the job of the recipe writers to get all the details right, so if parchment works on the bottom of the pan instead of butter, it should be noted. Ditto for the plastic wrap/ parchment.

To the cook from LA--Isn't the point to find a recipe that you enjoy making and that your guest enjoy eating? Following a recipe without ever changing it to suit you is reserved for recipe testers, not passionate cooks. Let yourself go.

To the Cook from Sudbury. I think your remarks were uncalled for. Not everyone is an experienced cook.Some people need to follow recipes. Perhaps AlicebToklis did not have a silpat. I know I don't because I don't like them. Beside recipes should be reviewed as they are written, not with the changes you have made to them. If you didn't make the recipe the way it was intended then you have no idea if it is a good recipe or not. Although I found the preparation easy I found the end result a bit lack luster.

Is there a reason not to line cookie sheets with parchment for this recipe? I'd love to get some silpats at some point, but I don't have any now, and I hate buttering cookie sheets. Usually it doesn't matter what the recipe says, I line my sheets with parchment paper. I'm surprised to see people discussing how you can't us parchment here.

Rating: 4
To AlicebTolkas from portland, or. Too bad you won't try these again & that you gave it such a bad rating. They're easy if you use the right equipment. First, if you bake them on a silpat (silicone mat), you don't need to butter the cookie sheets. Second, instead of using the saran wrap, a piece of parchment works just fine. Sometimes, you have to read beyond the recipe and just use a little ingenuity!!

great cookie gift.

These were a pain in the butt for how flat they tasted. You have to butter cookie sheets, not use easy parchment, then you have to flatten them with plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Ever try to get a greasy pieces of plastic wrap to lie flat and not stick to you, the dog, the counters and itself? Impossible. Since they have so much fat in them, on the cookie sheet and on the plastic wrap, they were greasy and just ho hum. I'd never made them again.

TO DIE FOR!!!!! Made these for Thanksgiving with my own pistachio brittle crumbled on top instead of plain pistachios. I found that in order to be crispy they needed to bake for closer to 10 minutes. I made a double batch and these disappeared before we hit Saturday! I'm already receiving requests to make them again.

Made these without the pistachios and found them to be a bit boring. Jazzed them up by adding the peanut butter frosting from the 'Peanut Butter and Fudge Brownies With Salted Peanuts' recipe and made them into little sandwiches. Very yummy, but waaaay rich.
