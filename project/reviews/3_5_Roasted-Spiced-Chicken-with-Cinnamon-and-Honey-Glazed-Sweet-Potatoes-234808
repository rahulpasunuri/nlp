I can't believe it has taken me almost 6 yrs to finally make this! This is a really good variation on grilled/roasted chicken. Could easily be made with any chicken parts and would also be good w/pork. Marinated overnight and then most of next day and grilled on bbq. Also did sweet potatoes, to which I added a little more lime...a very nice combination of flavors for both of them. Served with a green salad and a nice glass of red wine.

Well, I put too much garlic in the spice rub. I got confused and thought that all 6 cloves were supposed to go in the spice rub. Anyway, it was good, but labor intensive, and I'm not going to try this one again for awhile--but I will try it again.

We loved this recipe. Cooked it the same day so didn't get the full marinade effect. Sauteed some of the onions, garlic and spices to toss into couscous as a side. Sweet potatoes were delicious!

Made this dish twice. First time marinated the chicken overnight, second time for 4 hours -- both got rave reviews from friends and family. Used allspice (not berries) and jalapeno pepper (not bonnet) for marinade; worked well. Sweet potatoes dish is exceptional -- prepared as written. Did not use mango chutney; no need.

I thought this was good, but not great. The flavors were different, and I used a whole roaster chicken. My paste came out fine and the chicken brown, not grey as some other reviews. I would make the potatoes again, they were delish! I didn't use the mango chutney..didn't see the need for it.

I only used the sweet potatoe recipe- very good. they took longer the 25 minutes to cook. Made with salmon w/stone ground mustard & horseradish- delicious combination!

I loved the spices on the chicken! I used bone in breasts and a whole jalapeno instead of a scotch bonnet (it was what I had). This was delish! Dh wanted a little less allspice- but for me- it was awesome. Sweet potatoes were nothing special- they needed some spice to wake them up, imo. Overall, very easy and delicious!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I used extra large boneless chicken breasts (2 breasts were approx. 1.5lbs) and added a couple tablespoons of fresh squeezed orange juice to the marinade. I also used a full habenero pepper, since we like it spicy. I baked the chicken breasts for the recommended time and they came out very tender and moist. I loved the flavor of the sweet potatoes. The lime is essential. I'll make this one again!

I made this according to the recipe but had to reduce cooking time by about 10 mins b/c my chicken thighs were on the small side. The other change I made was to replace the butter on the sweet potatoes with olive oil. I figured it was a natural pairing and would be better tasting than the butter. I thought the marinade was OK. In retrospect I should have broiled the chicken right at the end for a couple minutes to get some color on the marinade. I found it to be - as other reviewers- an unappetizing grey color. The sweet potatoes were wonderful. The key with them to lay them out on the pan in a single layer to get a little color on them and to create a bit of a crust on the outside. In all I think this was good and a keeper but not part of the regular menu in my household.

I thought this was delicious, as did my family. My only problem with it was the unattractive grey color on the chicken, but that may have been because I used skinless chicken.

This was not good at all. I must have made a mistake somewhere along the way. My marinade was not pasty as the recipe said it would be and though the yams were good they needed to be cooked longer. The chicken had a strange flavor. No one in my family liked it.

I like trying out new recipes, and this one was no disappointment. The flavors are very unique, but work well together. I would definitely make the marinade earlier next time though. It takes awhile to chop everything up.

I made this for my husband and me and we loved it! We have been trying new things and this was one of them. I cut the sweet potatoes thinner so they would cook faster and they turned out great. Also, I boneless/skinless chicken breast instead... also worked! Clean up was a little bit wearisome because we used foil on the sheets we baked the potatoes on. Unfortunately the foil stuck to the sheets in places. That may just be because I don't know what I am doing :) I have still yet to get some of the foil off. I also didn't really measure all of the ingredients and the chicken was very gingery. I may use less ginger next time. Lastly, I substituted Jalepenos. YUMMY! Will definitely make this again.

I am always looking for new chicken recipes that are tasty and really different. This was very flavorful and delicious. I didn't have any chilis in the house, so I used a hot sauce that had habaneros as a main ingredient and it worked well. I also used the pale white sweet potatoes rather than the red ones as they are not as sweet. It was much more to our taste. I will definitely cook this again.

I used lamb chops instead of chicken and it was delicious. The sweet potatoes were really nice with it also.

Very good. The sweet potatoes needed to cook a little longer to get really tender. Great flavors.

This is my favorite chicken recipe. Ever. It had a very distinct smoky/spicy flavor. My cooking time varied from the recipe and the chicken took around 55-60 min. To truly get 4 servings out of it, I would double the sweet potato portion. I cant stand cooking spray so I buttered the pan for the potatoes and it worked just fine.

Wow! This was terrific! No habernos at Safeway, so also substituted serrano. Too hot to use oven, so grilled carefully. Served with brown rice and steamed snow peas, with mango salsa on the side. Will keep in rotation, for sure!

This is my favorite chicken recipe of all time! I make it exactly by the directions and it always turns out so lovely. I have learned to line my baking pans with foil to make clean-up possible!

I made the chicken and potatoes exactly as the recipe stated. It was tasty but a little too vinegary for me.

Ooooooo....yummy! I made this for my cooking club's Caribbean night and we all raved! The kitchen smelled so good while it was cooking it was all we could do to wait for it to be done. One of the girls in our group is very sensitive to the spiciness of peppers, so I used a jalapeno instead of a Scotch Bonnet. You still get a little heat and bite, just much milder, so it's a good alternative for anyone with the same sensitivity. Savory, spicy, juicy, sweet... I'll be making this again soon!

This chicken was fan-tastic. My guests (one was a chef) raved. I did add 1t curry powder (curry seemed like it belonged there) and 1/2c apple cider for a more liquidy marinade (I had a little more chicken than the recipe calls for). I could not find a scotch bonnet pepper so I used a serrano chile. I also didn't make the potatoes in this recipe--ended up that I didn't have time so I just tossed chunked sweet potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper, honey, curry powder & pumpkin pie spice. Turned out wonderfully--nice balance for the chicken. This one is going in my 'keeper' file!

This was tasty and easy to make, once the chicken was marinating. I couldn't find whole leg/thigh chicken pieces so I just used the same weight in whole breasts. I loosened the skin to get the marinade underneath, and then when the chicken was done I removed the meat and sliced it into four portions. I did find the melted butter coagulated into the glaze for the sweet potatoes, I may warm the remaining ingredients a bit before adding the butter next time I make this. I served with curried rice with golden raisins. Cleanup is a little difficult since the excess marinade and glaze got burned to the pan, but that's my husband's job.;)

This was fabulous! As other reviewer said, no fuss, but definitely good enough for summer company. The chutney is a must! Even the sweet potatoes were incredible. This comes from my favorite Bon Appetit mag in a long, long time. Many good recipes this month!

This is one of the best low-fuss meals I've made in a long time. Definitely serve with chutney.
