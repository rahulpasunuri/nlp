I was browsing bean recipes when I saw this.... Growing up in Upstate NY and being of Italian heritage, I'm surprised at the amount of reviews of those who haven't had green beans with olive oil (and garlic for us). Funny, because when they are made, they are often eaten by the lot of us before the meal is even served...we just pick at them until they're gone! Delicioso!

Love this!! I like my beans crunchy and to basically taste raw so I only cooked them for three minutes. Also, This is the first time I made this, but I am thinking about using 2 teaspoons instead of 2 Tablespoons. That should be plenty, and it will reduce the calorie intake! yay!

Best beans I've ever made.

I added fresh ground black pepper and I infused the oil with garlic really quickly while the beans were cooking. It's the easiest recipe ever and quite tasty.

So simple, yet so delicious. This has become our standard way of enjoying green beans. Sometimes I add some fresh lemon juice or parmesan or balsamic vinegar to change it up, but it's perfect as written. Enjoy!

this was good and simple, although i only used half the oil and probably needed even less.

So simple. So good. Never would have thought to use olive oil- always used butter. I used Himalayan sea salt which I really enjoy. Yum!

Very good and definitely easy to do, although next time I'll probably use only about 2/3 as much olive oil.

This was so easy to make and so delicious! I used regular grocery store olive oil and it tasted fine, but I did use sea salt, which I think adds a new level of flavor to any dish. This could be a perfect, healthy alternative to french fries. The key is to not overcook them - they are definitely better crispy. Confession: I ate them by hand! Yum!

You can also stew the beans for ten minutes in a simple tomato sauce to jazz it up a bit.

I agree it is simple,but I would not have thought to use olive oil and this makes it unusual and tasty. I added one glove of chopped garlic and several dashes of red pepper to spice it up and everyone loved it. Quick and easy...presents well! I will make over and over again.

Very nice simple preparation for green beans. I used white truffle oil instead of olive oil and it was great.

They stole the show. I will make this recipe again and again. Good quality olive oil is a must of course.

The key to this is thin beans and really good grey salt. Amazing that something so easy can be so good.

I'm a bachelor who loves to cook and to eat, but tend to shy away from complicated recipes because I'm cooking for one. These beans were so good. I did just as the recipe instructed--the green flavor of the olive oil mixing with the beans and that crunch of the salt: perfect. No reason to skimp on flavor, and when you're working with fresh, local, organic produce, recipes like this give you just what you want: perfect preparation to showcase delicious food.

Yes. It's a recipe. Contrary to the comments below, this recipes perfectly demonstrates how the best ingredients can shine when allowed to do so, instead of being muddied by complicated cooking processes and long ingredient lists. And it takes a cook who really appreciates food, rather than a cook with a big ego to satisfy, to come up with a simple combination that works. Try it with haricots verts right off the vine, a really fruity olive oil, and a sprinkling of crunchy fleur de sel. I like to finish it off with some ground true red peppercorn, which perfectly complements the olive oil.

Simple but nice- using olive oil wouldn't have ocurred to me.

Why is this recipe on epicurious? How imaginative! I think I saw this recipe on the back of the bag of Jolly Green Giant. File this one right next to your recipe for ice.
