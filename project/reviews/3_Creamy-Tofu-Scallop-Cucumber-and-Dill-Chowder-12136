I liked how easy this was but I agree with other reviewers that it's kind of bland. I added one small chopped potato, upped the lemon juice, added some broccoli florets, a jalepeno & garlic powder and ate it over pasta w/grated cheese, like another reviewer suggested. The cheese made it. I did not use scallops- I don't eat them- and I used firm tofu becuase that's what I had. I thought this would do well with chicken or something else to replace the scallops next time, or bacon mmm....

This was pretty good. I used veg broth instead of chicken, and took the advice of other reviewers and added a few cloves of garlic. I think corn would be good in it as well. I'm not sure if I'd make it again. The graininess from the tofu bothered me a little, I prefer something smoother and creamier. On the other hand, to go with the chowder, I also made a caesar salad using tofu as the dressing base (this I got from Ming Tsai), and it was VERY good.

Definitely use garlic...and it's AMAZING! There is a confusing part about "remaining mixture." What remaining mixture? Instead I used another cup of chicken broth to cook the scallops and then added them to the chowder. I actually used the "chowder" as a sauce and poured it over thin pasta...added a little cheese. It was like Alfredo! I will be using this as a base sauce and making additions such as saffron or curry. YUM.

definitely add some minced garlic when sauteeing the onion. this is a great, light first dish with a really lovely color if you leave the cucumber skin on. surprisingly, i found that a dash of tabasco to the finished product was really gooood and livened the flavor up a bit. (but it was great without tabasco too...)

The previous reviewer does have a good point -- 8 oz of FIRM tofu has 20 g of fat! However, this recipe calls for about 6 oz of soft tofu, which has about 5 g fat -- a great deal less than 6 oz of cream. (Water content makes a big difference.)

Just wanted to clarify to those who might not know much about beancurd. It is not a fat-free food. (I thought the introduction to this recipe a little misleading in that respect) I think soy products in all their forms are wonderful -I make my tofu from scratch- but don't use it thinking that you're getting away with something. lol

Loved it! Add some garlic and it is very tasty. I am fairly new to using tofu so this was a very pleasant suprise.

I thought it was bland. Garlic may have helped.

I added lots of garlic and used shrimp sauted first in garlic and olive oil. Nothing said it had to be all vegetarian. I also increased the amount of dill used. It was pretty tasty. I would make it again.

first the person never said that it would be a vegetarian recipe. second there are varying degrees of vegetarianism and you can be a semi-vegetarian or an ovo-lacto vegetarian and still eat seafood as long as you avoid red meat and poultry. third try substituting chicken broth with vegetable broth.

Scallops are not a vegetable so how would this be vegetarian without chicken broth?

Why does this dish have chicken broth in it? I thought this would be a wonderful vegetarian chowder until I saw the chicken broth. Yuck!
