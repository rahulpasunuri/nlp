Delicious, beautiful, loved by all guests. Pom seeds are now available everywhere in tubs. Watched youtube videos on sectioning citrus. By grapefruit #2 I was a pro. A dangerously sharp knife is key. And yes, use dry mint. Leftovers keep very well.

Very yummy dish! I made the sugar/ mint mixture a couple of hours in advance and the mint quickly oxidized and turned brownish. Next time I will make it immediately before serving. Because of the unattractive color I tossed it into the fruit instead of sprinkling it on top and it looked and tasted fine. Leftovers tasted great even a couple of days later.

This is delicious and the colors are beautiful.

Made this today for a work potluck. Oh my goodness--SO simple but so delicious. Supreming the citrus is a lot easier if you use a serrated paring knife. It still takes a while (especially because I more than doubled the recipe!), but it's worth it. Looks beautiful on the table, and everyone loved it! As someone else said, make sure your mint is dry before processing--my leaves were damp from washing, and the sugar got kind of a crumbly, sticky texture. Still delicious, just not as easy to serve! Will know better next time.

love this recipe. this is one of my go-to brunch recipes. the mint sugar gives the citrus another layer of flavor that wows guests! i had never used the pomegranate seeds until the last time i made it; it's a nice addition, but is by no means necessary. i also followed one of the reviewers' suggestion last time and made thin slices instead of sectioning the fruit ... changed my life! definitely recommend to save time.

This recipe is quite delightful and is perfect for fall. The colors are gorgeous and it is overall a beautiful salad. The mint sugar adds just the right of freshness. I had many rave reviews. The only down side is that prepping the citrus takes some time. I will certainly make this again.

I am a grapefruit fanatic and this hit the spot! I mistakenly only had 4 oranges but it all worked out since I prefer the tart grapefruit. I put all the segments in a strainer over a bowl to catch all the juice and used it in smoothies throughout the week. In the hour that the salad sat befor eating, lots of juice had accumulated, probably from all the sugar. Because of the juice the dried cranberries had plumped up a bit and by the next day they were no longer tart, just sweet. Next time I'll just top it with cranberries before eating.

Loved this refreshing salad! Went really well with the goat cheese and prosciutto strata. Will definitely become a staple whenever I make brunch.

I made a variation of this using only clementines and pomegranate seeds with the mint sugar. (No grapefruit lovers in my household.) Beautiful, very tasty, light and sweet. A perfect contrast to the prosciutto and goat cheese strata, with the huge benefit that you can make as much or as little of this as you need for the size of your dining party. If you don't think mint and citrus go together, think again! This is the adult version of sipping orange juice through a peppermint stick. :)

Really delicious salad that pairs well with many savory dishes. Fruit prep is definitely time consuming, but so wortht the effort!

I am 10 years old and made this for thanksgiving. Everyone loved it!

This was so easy to make. I had help cutting up the fruit so it did not take as long. I added dried cranberry's and pineapple to the salad to make it feed more people. Everyone really liked it at the potluck.

To me, this is the very essence of Christmas morning! I've made it in the past and found it a ton of work, but so good, I suffered. Then I read someone's review wherein they suggested just slicing the fruit. Mon dieu! Such ease, such pretty slices! Plan to mix in some of the sugar, then layer on a platter with additional sugar and whole mint leaves.

This is my go to fruit salad recipe when I am having a brunch. I have been making it for several years. It is very light & refreshing and compliments most brunch items. I love it because you can prepare the fruit the day ahead and mix the sugar and mint in just before. In a pinch, I have used the citrus fruit salad in a jar from the produce section, but, of course, using the fresh fruit is much better.

Refreshing and delicious. After the first grapefruit I felt like a citrus sectioning pro. I used dried cherries because I already had them in the house. I made it one day ahead and didn't have any problem with the fruit falling apart. Make sure your mint leaves are dry when you grind them with the sugar. Mine was a little clumpy because the leaves where damp.

I made this for Christmas brunch along with Cowboy Christmas Breakfast and Hash Brown Brunch Casserole. They are all yummy! I used cherry- flavored dried cranberries, and it looked as great as it tasted! The leftovers the next day were just as great. I can't wait to make it again. It is easy to downsize for 2 people...

Easier way to do the fruit - cut the rind off of all the citrus, including white pith. Then cut the citrus crosswise into pretty circles. Much easier and no need to section the fruit.

i sectioned the fruit the night before, which took over an hour. i also do not have a food processor so i finely chopped the mint, mashed it in with the sugar, and let that sit overnight before mixing it in with the fruit the next morning. i used the pomegranate seeds, and it really was a beautiful and refreshing fruit salad.

Very tasty salad. My only problem what that I sectioned my fruit the night before and it started to fall apart by the time I served it. I ended up serving a bowl of pulp w/ pieces of fruit, which did not look very appetizing. The brave souls who did venture a taste, however, loved it.

I"ve made this recipe every Christmas morning since the recipe was in print. My family loves it and it goes well with any breakfast buffet to add something refreshing to the menu. I'm printing it right now for my Dad's wife!

This has become a staple in our house whenever we prepare a special breakfast. Beautiful colors for the holidays, too. I've used both pomegranate and cranberries - both are lovely. On days when I don't have time to do all the segmenting, I just cut a grapefruit in half, top with the mint sugar, and add some dried cranberries. MUCH quicker and still beautiful and tasty!

I added clementines to the navel oranges and grapefruit, which adds a little sweetness, so I also cut back on the sugar. I didn't have mint, so I added some cinnamon instead -- Moroccan style -- and it was delicious. I will try it with mint, but I recommend cinnamon if you're looking for a variation.

This is very time consuming so definitely section the citrus ahead of time. Holds up well overnight. The addition of mint is great. Forgot to include the dried cranberries but no one seemed to notice. Everyone loved it.

I rate this a 3 only because it takes so much work to section the fruit. We prepared this after our 5k y-me race for breast cancer. It was a very refreshing dish after a run and went well with our rich breakfast casseroles

Great fruit salad for brunch. I made it without the dried cranberries or pomegranates and still received rave reviews. The mint sugar was easy and made it very light and fresh...a great accompaniment to rich brunch recipes. The sectioning process is quite labor intensive, so I'd recommend doing it the night before. You really don't lose any of freshness and the salad still keeps well for several days. Will definitely make this again.

This dish took more time than I would have liked, and I wasn't able to remove all of the membranes from the grapefruit without it falling apart, but once I tasted it, it was well worth the trouble. It was so refreshing and tasted great with the egg strata I also made. I'm not usually a lover of citrus, but this dish was an exception.

Problem with the mint sugar: I made it ahead of time and it ended up in a big glop. Next time I will follow the other reviewer's suggestion and add sugar and chopped mint separately. It would be just as pretty. Overall a nice, tasty make-ahead brunch salad

We really enjoyed this dish, and have now made it twice, once with dried cranberries and once with dried cherries. Both versions were good, but the cranberries provided more attrative colour.

Used the dried cranberry variation out of laziness (didn't want to seed a pomegranate). Thought the addition of the mint was different and something I wouldn't have thought of with the citrus. Was delightful and refreshing and went wonderfully with the balance of the menu (Prosciutto and Goat Cheese Strata, Roasted Red Potatoes with Lemon and Pear and Dried Cherry Frangipane)

Very refreshing! I used dried cranberries instead of the seeds, but I don't think it needs either. I didn't bother with the mint sugar - I just mixed in sugar (half of what was called for in the recipe) and chopped mint. The combo of mint and citrus is wonderful.

I've been making small batches of this for a week. The pomegranate seeds look like little red jewels in the salad; we had it Christmas morning and it's beautiful. The mint sugar is a nice and fresh and adds to the presentation, but it's also good without it in a pinch.

I wasn't sure about the mint sugar but it turned out wonderful -- very refreshing combination of mint and grapefruit -- a terrific palate cleanser on a brunch buffet.

This was attractive and refreshing. The mint sugar added a nice touch. I must have used a pomegranate that was not quite ripe, because the seeds were a bit crunchy, which wasn't terrific. Otherwise, it's a nice way to dress up a citrus fruit salad for a special occasion.
