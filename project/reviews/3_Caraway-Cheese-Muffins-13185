I disagree that these were dry- I thought the texture was excellent but I used lots of cheese. I didn't have caraway seeds so I added cayenne and black pepper for spice. Next time I would reduce the salt though.

These were great. Cheesy, moist, and buttery. I used one PACKED cup of aged cheddar (perhaps the reviewer who found the muffins dry didn't use enough cheese?). I was out of caraway seeds so I sprinkled a few cumin seeds on top. Delicious! I will make these regularly in the future.

Just OK. I followed the recipe exactly and the muffins were dry. The caraway seeds looked like ants on top on the muffin. Not a keeper

Easy and delicious. I used poppy instead of caraway seeds and they were perfect. So buttery that they didn't need additional butter.
