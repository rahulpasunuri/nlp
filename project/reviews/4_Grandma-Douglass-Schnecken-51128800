Huge hit, fantastic. Brought them to the office after I couldn't stop eating them at home, and they were devoured in an hour. Co-workers are begging me to make more. Very easy to make too.

Incredible! I made the recipe exactly as suggested(which is something I do not often do) and the Schnecken was delectable. I couldn't stop eating them.This recipe puts cinnamon buns to shame. Thank you Grandma Douglas for sharing this fantastic recipe.

Grandma Douglas, I wish you were MY grandma! I made these amazing schnecken for a brunch I had recently, and everyone LOVED them. I usually don't do a great job with yeast recipes but this one worked like a charm. When i rolled the dough up w/ the cin & sugar, I cut it in half length-wise first and made two rolls. This made my schnecken mini-sized, which is great because they are rich and sweet so smaller is better, with the added bonus of making the recipe go farther, making more people happier! The best part is I did all the rolling and cutting, etc the night before, then stored them in the fridge overnight. In the morning I took them out, let them rise & baked them as guests arrived. The house smelled amazing!
