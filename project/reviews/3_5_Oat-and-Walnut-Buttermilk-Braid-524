Delicious! Added 4 tsp. of vital wheat gluten. Bread raised up beautifully and is not dense at all. I think the 50 min cook time was about 15 min too long.

Given the other reviews I must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe as described but it was way too dense and mealy. Hummmm?

Good good good! Definitely make two braids - they will still be large. Baked for 30 minutes.

Delicious bread with a hint of sweetness and a nice crumb. As another reviewer did, I made two braids, as there was plenty of dough. I baked for 35 minutes. I followed the recipe for the rest and had w onderful result. Will definately make a again. The bread kept well for at least a day.

I've never rated a recipe before, but I had to rate this one. This bread is unbelievable! I'm getting raves from everyone who tastes it. Definitely a keeper! P.S. I used all-purpose flour + about 4 tsp. of wheat gluten instead of bread flour.

Just add me to the list of people who think this recipe makes a terrific bread. It has a nice wheaty texture, but is neither too dense nor too sweet (most bakery breads add too much sugar to wheat bread.)

I have made this bread several times by now. It is great with savory or sweet things. My only comment regarding the recipe is that I have never baked it for more than 35 minutes. The recipe's call for 50 minutes is much too long. I have also made two loaves very nicely rather than one large braid.

I have made this bread before, but somehow, I misplaced the recipe/issue, and was totally bummed! My whole family likes this bread, and I have recommended it to other people, who have also enjoyed it. I made two braids with this recipe, mainly because my oven is very small, and cannot handle the size of pan it takes for the one loaf.

Very good bread!! My husband and mother in law really liked it, they said it tasted and looked like the kind you get at a good bakery. Also she asked me to bring this bread to our next family reunion. I will also advise you two make two braids istead of one because this is a large recipe. This is a keeper!!

Delicious bread - very good toasted or untoasted with jam.

I tried this recipe because I had leftover lowfat buttermilk to use up. It was delicious. My husband said to mention that he really enjoyed it. I'd definetly make it again. Depending on the size braid you like, the recipe could make two smaller braids instead of one large one. The one large braid barely fit on my cookie sheet.
