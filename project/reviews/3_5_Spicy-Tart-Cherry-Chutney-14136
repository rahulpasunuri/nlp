This has become a staple for when we BBQ lamb. It's fantastic... the cherry + cardamon combo really works well. We used fresh cherries and it was thickened after about 60 minutes on a low simmer. It's a great make-ahead for parties, keeps well in the fridge.

This makes a huge amount of chutney. I never could get my to thicken up and so it just never turned into what I know as chutney. I also used canned sour cherries which were fine. Flavors were good...but if I made this again, I think I would add some cornstarch or other thickening agent.

I made this to serve at a dinner for 50. It was a huge hit even though I used canned cherries instead of frozen. It is very easy to fix and keeps nicely in the refrigerator. Serveral guests asked for the recipe....good sign.

My guests gobbled it up. The cardamon adds an unusual flavor. I left out the onions and used fresh cherries in season.
