Very good recipe to start from. I used some sweet hawaiian rolls and chopped them up in the food proccessor and then added my salt and crushed black pepper, thyme, parsley, garlic powder and onion powder. I also added some panko breadcrumbs for that extra crunch. Before I breaded the tenderloin I brined it for 2-3 hours then rinsed and covered in flour, dipped in egg then into the breadcrumbs and let sit for an hour or so so that the breadcrumbs had a chance to really adhere to the meat. I didn't sear the meat on the stove before roasting it because I didn't want the crust to come apart, instead I just put meat on a sheet pan w/ a wire rack and put in the center rack of the oven. When it was done the crust was nice and crunchy and golden brown w/ an internal temp of 160*, took about 35-40 minutes at 350. Served w/ some red potatoes that I chopped up and tossed w/ olive oil and freshly chopped garlic then roasted in the oven along side the pork until golden brown.

Really fantastic - once again. Made crumb mixture in advance and froze it. Pulled it out of freezer on Christmas day and then used for dinner. I mix a couple of tablespoons of dijon mustard in with the eggs . . . Served with the mushroom/potato/leek/gruyere dish from this site (very recent recipe). They all loved it and the potatoes were a hit for leftovers for breakfast the next morning!

First of all, I must say that epicurious has made my life so interesting. I got home from work at 7 pm; had pork tenderloins defrosted in the fridge but no definite plan in mind. I found this recipe printed out in my file (never made before). I was a little lazy; even though I have tons of rosemary growing in my yard, and fresh parsley as well, I used dried rosemary and parsley mixed with a combo of panko bread crumbs and 1 piece of sourdough quickly processed in my mini- processor. Then followed the recipe and had delicious, moist, tender roast pork tenderloin by 8:20. I should mention that I first quickly peeled potatoes, tossed with onions, garlic, olive oil, dried rosemary, salt and pepper before even starting the pork and had a complete meal ready for the family by the time they returned from the usual extracurricular activities. Not bad for a Monday night! I personally loved the pork; delicatelly flavored, so moist, and will take a bit for lunch tomorrow. Plus, while the food was roasting, I managed a bit of online shopping to boot. How did my mother ever live without internet????

I used the suggestion to add mustard and flour to the dipping line. I think it would have been better if marinated in mustard and olive oil. I'll try that next time. Also, it took 40 minutes in the oven.

As suggested by other reviewers, I coated the tenderloin with dijon and fresh rosemary and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. Then I coated it with the eggs and Panko. Had trouble keeping the crumbs on during the browning process but still worth it. I loved the results and the dijon added tremendous flavor.

I slice the tenderloin into medalions prior to breading with flour, egg then breadcrumbs. I also add parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs for extra flavor and it tends to hold the breading even bettter. By preparing and cooking as medalions the oven time and temp is simply for keeping the tenderloin warm while you cook the second batch. I love this recipe and so does everyone that I serve it to.

I used this breading for chicken because I had a lot of parsley and rosemary harvested from my garden. It is very flavorful. I had a lot leftover and I froze it in small ziplocks. It thawed out beautifully.

Just okay, nothing more. While easy enough to prepare, some things about the recipe as written are off. 6 cups is way too much bread crumbs and the pork needed about 40 minutes in the oven to cook through.

for a better crust I used Panko breadcrumbs, the Japanese kind.Also i agree the use of flour to help in coating.We tried this recipe on a six bone rack and added mustard to the crumb and herb mixture

Coat the tenderloin with flour to make the crumbs stick. The flour sticks to the pork, the eggs to the flour and the crumbs to the egg. Classic way to adhere a crispy crust, as with fried chicken.

very easy and very good. had so many compliments. a great deal of taste for so simple a recipe

The key to tweaking this recipe up a bit is to stuff garlic cloves inside the pork loin before seasoning it. I also made sure the oil in the pan was VERY hot before browning the crust. I used home-made croutons for the breadcrumbs too, which worked beautifully! I would make this again and again.

Rating: 1
I made this recipe for guests last night and although it had an OK flavor, it wasn't worth all the effort. I had even taken the advice of previous reviewers and marinated the pork with a paste of grainy dijon, white wine and fresh chopped rosemary and parsley. I breaded it and refrigerated for two hours before searing. I really had to finesse it to keep the crust from staying behind in the skillet and when I went to slice it, it didn't want to stay on. Needless to say, its not worth repeating.

We made this at the last minute for the family. I used prepackaged breadcrumbs and crumbled the parsley, rosemary and bay leaves from our spice cabinet. The kids loved it..ages 6 and 9. My husband and I also thought it was delicious. We made a gravy from the pork particles which was only OK but worth the effort.

Well this took me a lot longer to cook than it says here, but it was WELL worth it. It was flavorful and oh so tender. Very easy! Will definitely make again!

Very good!! This was easy & simple to add a bit of flavor too a somewhat boring dish. I did subsitute the fresh breadcrumbs with blended up day old herbed croutons. Seems to give to dish a bit more zip. Also, I didn't use either rosemary or thyme, but used paprika, crushed chiles, & mixed herbs. The coating reminded me of Thxsgiving stuffing. One thing though, the recipe says to bake the tenderloins for approx. 30min, I think that's a bit deceiving. I had to cook my tenderloin (single serving) for 45min in order to get the desired temperature & the majority of the loin' to cook through. It was still very juicy. Will make again.

We LOVED this recipe! I used 1 Tbl. Herbes de Provence instead of the fresh rosemary. Also used half commercial breadcrumbs. However, six cups was WAY too much, even thought I "double-dipped" in eggs and crumbs. Everyone loved it, and I would keep this as an entertaining staple.

I have made this dish several times now, and the reviews from our guests are always terrific! I have followed several suggestions from prior reviewers, like allowing the pork to marinate for a couple of hours in a coating of white wine (a good chardonnay), country dijon mustard, and fresh herbs (rosemary, parsley, sage) and coarse ground pepper. Then, coat with breadcrumbs when ready to cook (I like to use Japanese Panko breadcrumbs, which cook up light and crispy, giving a nice crunch to the dish). Enjoy!

Great recipe! Easy, and delicious. We just made this for eighty people and I will definitely make this for family gatherings. We used pork loins (remove fat)instead of tenderloins and because we made them in a convection oven the cooking time was about the same. Served it with escalloped apples and red skin potatoes with parsley. Great meal!

The only deviation I made to the recipe was to coat the pork with country dijon mustard first...followed the recipe after that (but I did have to cook it a few minutes longer). My husband loved it and I will definitely make it for guests.

Like just about everybody else I can not follow instructions. Hence I tweaked the recipe. Marniated the pork in white wine, minced garlic and fresh rosemary overnight. In addition more herbs were used in addition to ramano cheese. Also coated the pork with dijon mustard. Can you say yum? Sure you can!

This is a true stand-out. I have made it several times with RAVE reveiws. A friend who is a trained NY chef literally fell out of her chair when tasting. The last time I made this, I brined the tenderloin for 2 hours in a mixture of 8 c. water, 1/2 cup kosher salt and 1/2 cup sugar. WOW - it made the pork absolutely melt in the mouth. Be careful not to over cook the pork.

After trying it the first time as per the recipe, I must admit I varied this recipe each time greatly but the concept is divine. It's a very forgiving recipe. I've used ground almonds instead of bread crumbs and sauteed them in oil w/ the herbs. I've also used a mustard/mayo combo instead of the eggs. I brushed the mixture on and patted the crumbs on. I've also added sliced apples and garlic from time to time to offer different flavors. My husband who HATES pork raved this was the juiciest and tastiest dish he's ever had. I've made it several times since and have served it to my guests!

To the last two cooks who advised against reviewing the recipe without using the exact ingredients-- simmer down, there! I don't believe that every reviewer must follow the recipe exactly in order to have valid (and often helpful) suggestions. Isn't cooking also about improvising? Cheers.

This recipe is an easy, deliciously simply standby pork tenderloin recipe for me. Quantities and times are perfect. It looks good on the plate, but I don't see it as "company" food, which I prefer to have more complex flavors. I agree with below reviewer, those who have changed the recipe should NOT be rating it!!!! Adding mustard is just making a different recipe, as is using prepackaged, instead of fresh breadcrumbs (seasoning mix is all wrong). If you changed the recipe, your input is misleading for those who would like to try it.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly.I don't think it is fair to review a recipe that you have changed or added to. I did let the herbed roast sit refrigerated for about an hour before browning as I do with most breaded dishes. Fresh crumbs add a lot to this dish as opposed to fine dry pre-packaged purchased ones.

Rating: 3
The previous reviews say it all -- a very good, easy dish. I have made it twice, and the Dijon added prior to breading adds a nice flavour. I would really recommend this for those who suddenly find themselves whipping together a dinner party on short notice -- it's so fast, and presents well.

Rating: 4
My husband and friends all rave about this dish. I followed many of the suggestions made by other reviewers. No bay leaf, but all other herbs. Used packaged Italian bread crumbs rather than fresh (and only as much as was needed). Rubbed dijon mustard with seeds on the tenderloins before dipping in egg. Also refrigerated the breaded tenderloins for at least 4 hours before browning them in the skillet and had no problem with the breading falling off. I also served this sliced with sandwich rolls as a New Year's Eve snack and included several condiments like honey mustard, cranberry sauce, sour creme/horse radish, and the usual mayo, etc. I will make this again and again.

I found this a little on the bland side, although I marinated the pork in olive oil, garlic and rosemary first. I'd make it again but would use the idea of rubbing the pork with dijon mustard before adding the bread crumbs.

Wow. This was great. I made it for some dinner guests and they wouldn't leave without the recipe! It was very easy and very tasty.

I have now made this receipe 7 or 8 times. It is always outstanding. I have added, at times, different spices to add a little zest to the coating... sometimes making it spicy or garlicky... it is always wonderful and oh so tender and moist. And, so quick to make.I recommend it highly!!

This was delicious!! Followed a lot of the comments. WAY to many bread crumbs. Next time I'll use half the breadcrumbs and all of the herbs. I used fine dry bread crumbs and coated the pork with a honey mustard first, then in egg, then breadcrumbs. Let it sit in the fridge most of the day. Served this with the dried fruit compote from this site. Everyone raved!!!

This was outstanding. The tips from other reviewers were really valuable. I used way less breadcrumbs(fresh)and more herbs, though only those listed. I also coated the tenderloin with country style dijon mustard instead of eggs before coating with the crumbs. Refrigerating for 2 hours worked great and very little of the crumb coating fell off while browning. My family loves this and we have had it several times in the last few months.

I made this recipe for a casual dinner party of 8. Like some of the other cooks, I used italian bread crumbs and added other herbs which enhanced the flavor. Be sure to realy crisp the crust of the loins when searing in pan. One came out better than the other because I really "seared" it well. I served with whipped potatoes, pan gravy and an elegant pear and walnut salad.

I have a tendency to not exactly follow the recipe, so I actually incorporated some of the suggestions already given. I coated the tenderloin with the coursest pommerey mustard I could find before dipping it in the eggs. I also cheated and use packaged italian breadcrumbs. I didn't add any seasonings beyond what was already in the breadcrumbs. I cooked it as directed. This was, without a doubt, the best piece of pork I have ever cooked. I would highly recommend this.

I've never been a big fan of pork, but this was outstanding!! So moist and delicious, I could hardly believe it! I think the secret is in the fact that it's only cooked to 155 degrees (come to think of it, maybe that's why I've never liked pork before - due to overcooking!) This recipe is definitely going into my "keeper" recipe box!

To hold the breadcrumbs in place, dip into eggs then into bradcrumbs, back into the eggs and bread crumbs a second time. Place in refrigerator for two hours before browing. Can be done the day before and placed in refrigerator over night. Came out GREAT.

Our guests really loved this dish and the presentation was lovely. After reading other reviews of breadcrumbs not sticking, we decided to go with freshly dried breadcrumbs by taking a baguette and a loaf of pesto bread (eliminated the bay leaves from the recipe), drying them before processing with the herbs. We prepared the pork first with the egg dip then crumbs and refrigerated for approx 4 hours before browning. After browning, refrigerated approx 2 hours before roasting. The crumbs stayed on, the pork was incredibly tender and juicy - and it looked impressive too!

I've made this recipe several times. The first time I used dried breadcrumbs. I seasoned the bread crumbs with salt, pepper, dried parsley and rosemary, The next time I used salt, pepper, dried parsley, sweet basil and oregano. I have also used tarragon. Each time I serve it to new guests, they rave about it and ask for the recipe. When using dried bread crumbs you need about 1 1/2 cups for 2 medium sized tenderloins. They will serve 2 - 3 people very nicely. Thanks to a tip on a previous review of this recipe, I chill the tenderloins for at least an hour before browning them. (I have also prepared them the day before and left them covered in the refridgerator.

To save a few calories & add more flavor, I eliminated the egg & brushed dijon mustard on the pork before rolling in breadcrumbs. I, too, had a problem with the crumbs falling off; I have a feeling my pan may not have been hot enough. I also did not bake the pork on a rack; I used an oven-proof pan to brown the meat & then placed everything in the oven to finish. My husband deglazed the pan with brandy for a very tasty sauce. Even though the end result was a little ugly looking (because of the lost crumbs), it tasted wonderful.

We really enjoyed this recipe! A couple of good hints that made this dish so easy to make. Put the herbs in the food processor with the french bread - it really blends the tastes together. Also, refrigerate the breaded pork for about an hour before cooking it on the stove - it prevents the bread crumbs from falling off. Delicious.

Made this for my New's Years party where we had all kinds of fabulous Italian food. Had a bunch of kids at the party. Had loads of food left, but not a morsel of the pork was left over. (Every time a kid went through the kitchen after dinner I saw them grab a piece of meat!) Very easy & very tasty. NOTE: if you do saute it ahead of time and refrigerate it, you will need to increase cooking time to 30-40 minutes. Everyone raved about this recipe, I would definetly make it again.

This is a wonderful combination of flavors. The herbs really compliment the pork. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried (use 1/3 the amount of fresh!)and it tasted fine. A tip: since bay leaves, even in small pieces, are not something you want to bite into, try grinding them. I used a coffee grinder for this, and ground the dried rosemary too. I had no trouble with the fresh breadcrumbs staying on, but I mixed dried ones in with the fresh, which might have helped, and I let the breaded meat rest for 1/2 hour before I browned it. You definitely don't need the amount of crumbs the recipe calls for; I had tons left over.

I have made this dish several times. Each time I used "canned" breadcrumbs and had no problem with the crumbs falling off. I also found that crushing the bay leaves very finely also helps and adds to the flavor. This is one of my favorite pork tenderloin recipies.

Was not impressed with this dish. Despite the eggs, most of the fresh breadcrumbs fell off by the time the pork was ready to serve. Perhaps canned breadcrumbs would have been better? Also, dried bay leaves are not digestible by humans (that's why you remove them after cooking a dish) so I did not include them. I've had much better success with other pork tenderloin recipes.

I make pork tenderloin quite often and always have a little trouble when searing the meat...I didn't have that problem with this recipe. The breadcrumb coating made searing the meat a snap (no sticking). The results were a big hit with my family (no leftovers!).

The most tender pork we have ever eaten. Now, since pork products are farmed so carefully, there is not a speck of fat in them. This is good, but sometimes compromises the flavor, making the pork tough. The breading on this prevents this. Cooking to 155 is the perfect temperature, as the temperature rises as the tenderloins sit. I do think that the amount of breadcrumbs called for is excessive, I didn't need anywhere near that amount. Have to tell the truth. I was out of breadcrumbs and substituded packaged cornflake crumbs. Result was fabulous. I will continue to use them when I repeat the recipie.

Guest quote: "The most tender pork roast I have ever eaten." Cooking time is deceiving. Took about twice as long in an electric oven to reach 160 degrees.
