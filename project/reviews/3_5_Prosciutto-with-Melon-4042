I took cookycamp's advice and reduced a vinegar - an orange muscat champagne vinegar - and drizzled it on top. Simple yet so tasty.

This is great as is, but I wanted to make this just a bit more special. About a month prior to making this, I had come across a Pear-infused white balsamic vinegar. I took some of it and reduced it down to a syrup and drizzled it over the wrapped melon...OUTSTANDING! I think it would also be good with regular balasamic, reduced. Try it, you won't be disapponted.

This is always a delicious and easy dish to make. Another idea? Add kiwi as well, and wrap each piece of melon and kiwi in its own piece of prosciutto...YUM!

So simple and a nice addition to an Italian appetizer menu. As one reviewer suggested, I drizzled a little lime juice.

I hate to be a naysayer (especially since I love prosciutto and melon as much as the next gal), but does this really qualify as a recipe?

Like the previous reviewers, this recipe reminds me of my childhood. It was a regular first course at the table...Another recipe I remember, fried banana wrapped in bacon. A lovely mix of both the sweet and salty.

Great combination...my family has always sprinkled the assembled melon/proscuitto slices with lime juice and freshly ground black pepper.

I was so excited to see this in your recipe file, my family has been making it for years and it's simple combination of the posciutto and melon blend wonderfully together. It's a must, everyone should try it.

we like to roll the melon in the proscuitto, place a fancy toothpick in it, and serve as apptitizers. delicious
