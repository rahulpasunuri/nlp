Wonderful recipe and will make again. It was the first time I've made a bark. I may want a different way to caramelize the almonds, because this stuff set in under a minute, so speed is key if you don't want to spend time breaking up the nuts out of their caramel clumps. The sea salt was great and this was an ideal treat to make for Christmas- not too time consuming and easy to do.

This recipe is as addictive as other reviewers claim. My advice, however, is to make a dry caramel instead of a wet caramel. I tried the wet caramel method recommended in the recipe 3 times and ended up with a cemented mess. Just omit the water altogether, make sure your sugar is evenly distributed in your saucepan, then let it do its thing. Add the butter just as the recipe recommends when the caramel is done. See davidlebovitz.com for tips on "how to make the perfect caramel."

I haven't made this yet, but I figured out the calorie count since I'm looking for a recipe for a Biggest Loser picnic. Based on a 2 oz serving, it would be 262 calories if my calculations are correct. . Maybe 2 oz. would be too much per person. But it doesn't seem low cal or low sodium to me - but I'll make it for my chocolate loving friends.

This was fantastic, and the sea salt made it. I used high quality chocolate (sharfenberger) but regular almonds because I couldn't find the Marcona. Pretty easy to make. I've given it as gifts, but one friend warned me not to give it to her again, because she could not stop eating it. I plan to make this on a regular basis.

Pretty easy to make and simply amazing. I was skeptical about the salt, but it really made them. I made it with 4 other dessert recipes for Thanksgiving, spent all day baking and the family cleaned them all out in 20 minutes.

So quick to prepare & makes an elegant hostess gift. This is a winner all year, not just at holiday time.

This recipe is fantastic. We used to buy almond bar from a local store and would pay a fortune for it. Those days are gone! This bark is delicious with just the right mix of chocolate of flavors. I have given this as a gift to several friends and it always gets rave reviews! A definite crowd pleaser.

This recipe is sooo delicious. Make sure to double this recipe because for sure you will want more. When making the coating for the almonds, do not constantly stir the sugar mixture. Let the sugar dissolve and then let it do its thing. Coating needs to go on quickly. It hardens very fast .

This recipe is perfection! Used Valhrona 68% chocolate, Costco Marcona almonds, and Maldon sea salt- unbelievable. Sprinkled the salt on after the chocolate had set up a bit as other reviewers did; no problem with the nuts/ caramel, but took the time to break the nuts up into individuals after the caramel cooled. There should be a law against this recipe! A definite keeper, expensive, but worth every cent.

I made this recipe for the office, and it was BIG hit. It also took such minimal time to make! I will absolutely make this again. Just a few extra notes: I found the steps of the recipe to be a bit confusing. They don't say anywhere that you are caramelizing the almonds and then adding them to the melted chocolate after they have cooled. Also, if you are not familiar with making caramel (like myself), be careful not to overcook the sugar mixture...you'll have big mess on your hands.

I can't really give it a fork rating because the caramel set up so fast that I can't finish the recipe. I usually have no trouble working with caramel so I don't know what happened. If anyone has any thoughts, I would welcome them.

This was easy and really good! I omitted the water in the caramelizing process. I added the sugar directly to the pan. Swirled the sugar around periodically under a medium heat and in about 5 mins had a beautiful dark amber color. I also followed previous reviewers advice regarding the sea salt. It turned out great!

Excellent! Very easy and fun to make. Be sure to spread the mixture thinly. It tastes better and goes further. I stacked larger pieces in clear cellophane bags for Christmas gifts. I agree with other reviewers to let the chocolate cool a bit before adding salt. I also used Pink Himalayan Sea Salt. Beautiful!

Yum! This recipe was sooo good. I followed some of the others' recommendations regarding putting the salt on after the bark had cooled slightly, and pressing the extra almonds into the bark. I used Maldon sea salt which was awesome. I think when I make this again, I will add some pretzel sticks to it. Really tasty.

Wow...4 attempts to get the caramel. I think it needs to be a small pan so that the liquid is more concentrated. Mine seemed too thin in bottom of pan and turned solid, I also made sure the sugar was dissolved,but finally, success (I just couldn't let a recipe beat me), and it took alot longer than 5 minutes to become dark amber! But delish...agree with previous reviewer about the salt disappearing when put on while hot.

This was very easy and excellent. The only thing I would say is to sprinkle with salt after the chocolate has set a little (rather than right away). Otherwise, it basically melts into the chocolate and the crystal look is wasted.

I also had trouble with the first batch of caramel but when I used an enamel pot (Creuset) it turned out perfectly and the results were so good that I made a second batch of bark. I used 2/3 girardeli chips from Costco & 1/3 80% Lindt chocolate bar. I bought the Marcona almonds at Costco, a $7. jar was enough for 2 batches making in very economical. In one I used French Fleur de Sel and the flavor was outstanding but you cannot see the salt grains like they are in the picture. The next one I made with coarse sea salt, as the recipe says and you can notice the texture but the I prefer the more subtle flavor of the Fleur de Sel. The first time some almonds dislodged as I was cutting it and I used a match to melt the chocolate and press the nuts back. The next time I pressed the almonds deeper. The more I spread the chocolate the better the bark tasted, it was more balanced in the thinner bark. This was quick and easy to make and the guests loved it. I will make more before Christmas. I highly recommend it. Advice: even if some sugar is not totally dissolved, don't stir the pot after the first few minutes as it interferes with the caramel. If left alone it will be OK. Enjoy

I had a little trouble making the caramel that you toss with the almonds because I was using organic sugar which would never fully dissolve. After pitching the mortar-like substance that resulted, I made another batch with superfine sugar and added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the two tablespoons of water added to the sugar. It worked perfectly. I used Scharffenberger semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkled with Maldon sea salt and was thrilled with the delicious finished product. It will make a great gift for extra special friends and family. Expensive but worth it.
