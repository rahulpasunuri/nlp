Excellent recipe. Took advise of others and doubled the oil and the tomatoes as well. Leftover tomatoes were great lightly 'smashed' and served over pasta. The salmon was quick and easy to prepare. Subbed risotto for the couscous. The oil was awesome - used it on veggies, fish, etc. Highly recommend.

I'm not crazy about this dish. I have a great fish monger who buys fish whole and cuts it to order so I know it is very fresh and I prefer my salmon rare to medium rare to really allow the flavor to shine. This oil completely overpowers that flavor. It might be good with a heartier fish, but I agree with others that it is a lot of work and not worth the effort for me.

All I can say is wow. The lemon oregano oil took this dish from tasty to amazing. My parents sampled left overs cold from the fridge the day after and still thought it was delicious. It's not an "easy" dish, but absolutely worth it for special occasions.

Rating: 4
I didn't strain the oil and it was amazing. I doubled it based on the reviews here and I'm really glad I did. I used whole wheat pearl cous cous and it rocked. I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth. I felt the dish needed a green, so I added the pan browned brussels sprouts from Epicurious. Made a beautiful dish.

The tomatoes alone are worth making this recipe. I balked at the amount of time they would take, but they are simple to prepare and the oregano oil is spot on delicious. Great Saturday night supper!

Fantastic and simple recipe. I made it with wild salmon, much more flavorful. Only thing was I cooked only 8 minutes, any more than that it would have been dry to my taste. The tomatoes I exchanged for grape tomatoes and melody of small and colorful tomatoes slow roasted in a toaster oven for 20 minutes and collected all the left over oil in a serving bowl so guests could add to taste - they were a hit :) I also felt this dish needed something else, green so I added asparagus sautéed lightly in butter & lemon. Would absolutely make it again, it made me look like a better cook than I probably am :)

Simply a great recipe worth every minute spent in the kitchen. The roasted tomatoes are amazing.

Yummy meal, even with spur-of-the- moment changes! Instead of the slow roast, I placed halved grape tomatoes about 7-9 inches from the broiler and broiled them with the oil and seasonings for 15-20 minutes. They tasted excellent! (Wish I had doubled the amount.) Didn't have pearl couscous, used regular, which I toasted lightly. Omitted the capers. Forgot the lemon zest, but I didn't miss it. The salmon was sweet and deliciously cooked. I took it out of oven 4-5 minutes before the suggested time. Great dish! It's a keeper.

I've made this twice with great results both times. I used grape tomatoes the second time and liked the flavor more. I also used capers instead of olives since I am not an olive fan and they worked great. I also doubled the amount of tomatoes and oil. It was a big hit at both dinner parties. I think this will be my Easter menu for many years to come.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit. It takes a bit of time to roast the tomatoes, so you have to factor that in, but it's a wonderful recipe; it always turns out beautifully and everyone loves it!

Excellent but very simple recipe. Didn't have the oregano and it was still lovely with that flavor omitted. One thing to note: when I added the fresh basil into the hot oil, I didn't have a splatter guard and hot oil sprayed everywhere! I would also recommend doubling the infused oil so you can add more to both the couscous and the fish...it's wonderful!

amazin recipe, for very delicate palate; I personally would add more oil into the couscous and although the black olives are a nice touch I find them just a bonus, not necessary for awesome flavor.

I have prepared this meal exactly as presented at least 5 or 6 times....for guests. It always receives rave reviews. I served it preceeded by a warm roasted cauliflower/greens salad and homemade pumpernickel red omion scones. Dessert is a delicious Asian pear tart (crust prepared with plugra butter). Love to prepare it, love to serve it, love to eat it and love the delight of my guests!

I actually did not make this recipe for awhile but have had it printed out. I happen to have everything for it in my cupboard and wow!! This was fantastic. The only thing I left out was the olives because I do not like Olives. As a home chef this was a great addition to my recipes. Also the debate on Salmon is hilarious. I lived in Alaska for many years and was spoiled on the taste of real Salmon for a long time. Wherever you happen to buy your Salmon does not matter as long as you make this beautiful recipe.

This was exceptionally easy to make and absolutely delicious. I substituted cherry tomatoes on the vine for the plum tomatoes (roasted them on the vine and they presented very well). And also used marjoram in place of oregano. I doubled the amount of tomatoes and therefore lemon oregano oil, which I strongly recommend. I also used the lemon oregano oil to baste the salmon before broiling which helped incorporate the flavours throughout. The extra oil didn't last the meal as everyone kept drizzling their fish with it. I also saved the basil and garlic when I strained the oil and chopped it finely and coated fresh asparagus with the mixture and the little bit of olive oil that was left in the pan. This was a lovely addition to the meal and added a much needed green side. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Wow! The 4 of us loved this dish! I don't think what I purchased was Salmon--I think they sold me Arctic Char, which may be a type of Salmon? (it just smells sweeter and is a bit drier than Atlantic Salmon). I broiled the fish a bit at the end to give it a bit of color- it looked so white after baking, and that made it more appealing looking. The olives, the tomatoes, this type of couscous-- which I'd never had, was all so good together. It's restaurant quality for sure. I can't wait to make it again! Other than the tomatoes and oil which you can do in advance it's really not time-consuming at all and should make a great dinner party recipe.

Rating: 3
A REALLY great recipe but a lot of steps so quite time consuming. The toasted pearl couscous is so good but it needs to be really toasted. I ended up doing the tomatoes on the 'fast track' since I didn't read the directions thoroughly before starting. They were still great but not a 'shapely'. The lemon oregano oil is a must so don't omit. One nice meal all in one recipe.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I increased the portion of minced lemon zest to 2 tablespoons and the portion of lemon juice to 3 tablespoons because my boyfriend and I love lemon with salmon. I also subbed quinoa cooked in chicken stock for couscous (because I'm gluten intolerant) and it worked really well. Definitely the most delicious tomatoes. I would also pulled the salmon out at 12 minutes. 15 minutes at 500 degrees is going to overcook.

Rating: 4
This recipe is truly wonderful. I made the tomatoes the day before, and cooked the salmon and couscous the next day. The lemon oregano was a delicious addition to the couscous, which was really flavorful. The salmon was done perfectly. I will made more tomatoes and oil next time. although it you don't care about leftovers, the proportions are just right.

I seldom give four forks. This was so simple and quite tasty. I doubled the amount of tomatoes, and somebody else suggested. That was a good move. This is nice to do for a dinner party.

The slow roasted tomatoes are by far, the BEST tomato preparation I've had. Ever. My only criticism is that because they cook down, 1 lb of tomatoes are not enough for 6 people. I'd definitely recommend doubling the quantity. The combination of salmon, couscous, tomatoes and lemon oregano oil are absolutely delicious!

Rating: 4
So delicious! Didn't want to wait 2.5 hours for the tomatoes so increased oven temp to 350 for 60 mins. Probably could have just put tomato mixture (oil, garlic, basil) straight on the tomatoes rather than heating in the pan first. Also couldn't find fresh oregano so used dried instead. Cous cous was really flavorful as written in recipe rather than box directions. Salmon was done to perfection in 14 mins. Used 4 larger filets than recipe called for (8oz each). Definitely would make again.

This is a dinner party pleaser for a picky crowd. Flavors deliciously meld together. You don't need to make as many dishes since this is a bit of an all in one (veggie,starch, protein). Plus the presentation is beautiful. My kind of recipe, easy to prepare and presents well.

Rating: 4
I made this off the cuff on a Friday night with what I had easily available. I admit that I used canned (but sustainably caught) salmon and organic canned tomatoes (quality fresh not available yet). That being said, I thought this was an excellent dish. Will absolutely make again, will go to the effort of using fresh tomatoes and fresh salmon fillets. Personal taste, will probably up the garlic a bit.

Rating: 3
I realize that many readers want a review of the recipe as written, so if that is what you want, please, forgive me. I did not have salmon handy, so I made this with chicken (pounded breasts, sauteed in EV olive oil, a bit of salt and pepper), and the seasonings were quite delicious! I also could not find fresh oregano (2 stores), so used dried. Otherwise, I tried to stick to the main recipe otherwise, and will definitely do the roasted tomatoes with this seasoning. Although I have half a bag of Lebanese Couscous leftover, I could see this made with any other small pasta (like riso or orzo). I will try same seasonings with salmon soon, look forward to it.

Yum yum yum! I made exactly as written, except I did make some extra tomatoes. Even with nasty, out of season supermarket tomatoes they were so good. This will go into the "how to impress company" recipe file for sure!

We absolutely loved it! I did not however, strain out the garlic because we e are huge garlic lovers. Next time I will add lemons zest instead of finely minced. I enjoy zest must better. I found that the minced lemon rind gave the dish a bit of a bitter quality.

Really lovely take on tajine. One warning- I used the lemon oregano oil to toast the couscous, thinking this would add extra flavor to the couscous, but instead the fresh thyme and lemon turned bitter with the heat. Save the oil to add at the end as the recipe indicates...

This was very tasty, presentable, and easy to make. I didn't discard the herbs and garlic from the oil as directed in the recipe--I poured it into the couscous as it gave the recipe more texture and taste. Also, I used heirloom tomatoes which complimented the dish very well with their sweeter taste. However, I used more than directed and am happy I did so--the tomatoes are so delicious! I used high quality wild salmon until just cooked and it was completely worth it--very moist and flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious!! The only tiny change I made was not to strain out the garlic (I'm a garlic lover, I couldn't bring myself to discard it!) and oregano leaves prior to mixing with the chopped oregano and lemon juice/zest. Was a hit with my guests, will definitely make again!!

Delicious and easy salmon preparation. As long as you have time a day ahead or the morning of a dinner party, this is a super easy way to impress guests. I served this at my NYE dinner party for 6 guests and got rave reviews. We had barely any leftovers and made almost double the recipe. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and quadrupled the plum tomatoes - it was a good decision. We had some left over, but ended up putting them in scrambled eggs with some sausage we removed from the casings and there went our leftovers!

This is a delicious recipe! I made it last night for some friends and everyone raved about the taste, presentation, and overall experience :) I will definitely make it again and will roast more tomatoes and add more oil, prior to pouring on top of tomatoes, since I felt that there wasn't enough oil left over after roasting. Because I felt there wasn't enough I ended up adding a little more oil to the mixture as well as more lemon juice.

This was such a great easy recipe I made it twice in a row for guests this past week. My niece remarked that it was the best fish I ever made! I didn't precook the tomatoes, but threw them in the oven with all of the tomato ingredients together. I served this on a large platter, with a pile of couscous (dressing on the last minute or it all gets absorbed), then the fish with the tomatoe cut up on top. Sprinkled chopped cilantro on top and it was gorgeous and delicious.

Really good restaurant quality recipe. I combined this with another epicurious recipe for the salmon marinade only. So instead of salt pepper, I used soy sauce, sweet chilli sauce, garlic and ginger to marinate the salmon fillets for an hour. We followed the recipe for roast tomatoes to the T except we added lots of garlic:) which really made the tomatoes lovely. We roasted it at 275 degrees for 1.5 hour and they turned out perfect. The couscous went well with the salmon, the lemon oregano oil is the BEST !!! Don't be afraid to use a lot of basil and oregano everywhere ... It really brings out the deep flavors.

Being quite a food snob, I am not easily impressed but this dish was amazing! My boyfriend said that he has never had a better meal in his life!

Thumbs way up!!!

This needs something with more bite. My husband suggested more olives, but I am thinking something green--wilted arugula or watercress or broccoli raab. Otherwise, it's really good. The salmon is perfectly cooked, and the couscous is good, if unexciting. I will make it again, with some additions.

This is an amazing meal! I decided to make it before I realized the tomatoes have to roast for 2.5 hours, so I improvised - and it was still phenomenal. Rather than roasting the tomatoes in the oven, I prepared them as indicated and then cooked them in a 12" non-stick frying pan, face down and covered, while I prepared the rest of the meal. When they were soft, I took them out and proceeded as directed. It was delicious - and I got rave reviews. :)

YUM! This is one of my favorite weekday meals & definitely one of my favorite wild salmon dishes. The tomatoes & infused oil have such a fresh & flavorful taste. I like to use grape tomatoes (some whole, some halved)...takes less time & I prefer their sweetness. I have paired the salmon with both Israeli couscous & Moroccan couscous (tiny grains) and like both but prefer the Moroccan for it's texture & ability to soak up more of the tomato & oil flavors. When cooking the salmon, I put the oven on a high broil for the last 1-2 minutes to get more of a crusty char on top. If there are leftovers, I mix the tomatoes, oil & couscous together. Even better the next day!

If I could give this one five stars I would. It's definitely not the kind of dish you can make all the time because of all the time and energy that goes into it, but if you are looking for a dish that will knock your guests' socks off, this is it. The nutty cous cous, sweet tomatoes, delicate salmon, and fresh, punchy herb oil make for such a well-balanced, scrumptious dish. I've shared the recipe with many foodie friends (and served it to some as well), and they all agree...

Great recipe. Great flavours. Made it as written although I switched oregano to marjoran (same family but oh so much more tasty). Had a problem w/my couscous...took triple the time to cook. I think my product was bigger and more rustic than it is in the U.S. Overall a perfect dish but I already often make roasted tomatoes, zuke, eggplant with yummy infused oils to accompany grilled fish and chicken so next time I'll stick to my methods. Thanks for turning me on to the beautiful texture and taste of pearl couscous.

I had slow roasted tomatoes to start with. So I made the oil separately and followed the rest of the directions with the salmon. Served with the Spinach and Celery Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette on this site. Nice summery pairing. My only caution would be to ease up a bit on the cook time with the salmon. 500 degrees is hot, I only cooked for 9 minutes and it came out perfect.

I made this for a dinner party with both kids and adults. We grilled the salmon. The flavors were amazing and it looked wonderful on the plate. The first bite of tomato just explodes in your mouth. It was great that so many of the steps could be completed ahead of time. I did the tomatoes and lemon oregano oil the day before. I used good quality canned tomatoes for the roasting. The recipe worked well for kids because they could have their salmon plain if they wanted to, or without the olives. Easily customizable to peoples' tastes. A memorable recipe.

I've made this on several occasions. It comes out perfectly every time. I always make it for guests because it has that "wow" factor. I use grape tomatoes (no cutting involved) and cook them for the same amount of time. I've used both kinds of salmon with equal success. I've even substituted fresh thyme for oregano on occasion with equally delicious results.

FABULOUS! There were only two of us, but I made all the tomatoes anyway. Glad I did..they were so wonderful I ate four. The wonderful flavor combinations with different bites of what was on my plate was so delicious! I do not believe the tomatoes should be confused with oven roasted "dehydrated" that can be stored in oil. The 2.5 hours stated in the recipe was fine for me. I actually think I roasted mine for 2 hours and 45 minutes. I believe they are supposed to be really tender but still hold their shape. The sweet wonderful flavor was an unexpected surprise for me and I'll roast these again as written, for other purposes! Like pasta with feta and olives, etc. Or as a side with grilled meats..endless possibilities. The only change I made was to use all chicken broth for the couscous instead of part water. I think it needs it. I had never had "Israeli" pearl couscous before and it was so good! This recipe is a wowzer.

Rating: 4
This is an unusual, restaurant-quality dish. Very nice presentation. I think the pearl couscous is a must but can be bland. I added chopped garlic when the couscous was almost brown. I had trouble with the roasted tomatoes. They were mushy, and I don't know why. I thought adding the chopped olives on top was important for presentation, so I wouldn't add the olives to the couscous. My guests raved about this dish.

Rating: 4
phenomenally easy and delicious. super easy. impressive enough for guests as long as you don't overcook the salmon! make sure you get the tomatoes fairly dehydrated (enhancing flavor and sweetness), do not rush this step, it may take longer than the recipe says. can be done a day in advance and stored (submerged) in good-quality extra virgin. one of those less is more type dishes.

I'm not sure why so many people are raving about this recipe. I followed all directions, except that I used water instead of chicken broth for the Israeli couscous.

We are big fans of wild salmon in our house, but this recipe was just okay for me. The couscous was rather bland (even though we added some extra roasted tomatoes and black olives). The salmon needed "something" more in my opinion. It was very plain for this type of dish. Maybe coating the salmon with the lemon oregano oil before baking would have infused it with more flavor. I agree with previous reviewers that the roasted tomatoes were the best part. They were a bit hit! The couscous cooked perfectly for me, but it was still quite bland. Maybe I'm just a rice girl at heart.

Took suggestions of other reviewers and made extra tomatoes, added some chopped roasted tomatoes and olives to couscous. (12+ tomatoes, all eaten by only 4 people).

Interesting reviews aside, this is a GREAT dish and not terribly hard to prepare. I was able to find wild salmon, though I'm sure fresh-farmed would work just as well. The suggestion to toast the Israeli couscous and prepare in a skillet rather than a saucepan was a gem (thanks Austin)! I used fresh Greek oregano from the garden and it worked well. I also used cedar paper wraps to oven roast the salmon and it provided a nice subtle flavor. My husband loved the tomatoes and wanted more! A real keeper.

Actually, 3.5 forks, at least. I made this for friends and family Friday night and it is absolutely beautiful. I served it with haricots vert for extra color.

Wow, what a meal this was... Even the leftovers were great the next day. Our dinner guests were impressed and finished every last morsel on their plates.

For those of you who are using farm-raised salmon: I had no idea how different wild could be until I moved to the Pacific Northwest. I don't even bother eating salmon when it is not in season. There are many supposedly good seafood restaraunts that serve farmed salmon; I consider them second rate. I'd rather wait. Wild salmon in season is incomparable and if you can buy it do it.

I made this for the salmon and oregano which is up early in the spring. I had canned plum tomatoes in basil from TJ and frozen basil. It was very tasty even with the canned tomato and skinless boneless salmon from TJ and yes, regular couscous which I didn't roast and takes only 5 minutes. I can imagine it being even better with fresh basil and real plum tomatoes.

This was a restaurant quality recipe. I didn't worry about buying wild or farm raised from my little market (probably farm) and it turned out beautifully. Also, I bought a near east couscous and added the lemon oregano oil - delicious. Highly recommended. Very easy, just takes some planning to do the tomatoes.

one other thing about the couscous. It's labeled "toasted israeli couscous" at my market but I recommend toasting it again yourself because it really brings out the flavor. I also make it in a 12 inch skillet and it comes out fluffy and perfect. If you use a saucepan, it's pretty clumpy. This is also a great dish for leftovers.

I've made this dish several times with wild and farm raised salmon. The only advice I have is that you can't skimp on the roasting time for the tomatoes. Also, the basil crisps up and makes a really great texture contrast.

This is a superb recipe. The fork rating is way off! I used farmed salmon (it is November after all) and had to use regular couscous as I could not find the pearl type. One thing I noticed (and it could be my oven) is that the tomatoes were done after just over an hour. They were also delicious!! This recipe takes a while to prepare, but the separation of the steps and timeframe make it very simple overall. I will most definitely make this again and have to say it is fabulous.

I did not make this. I had it at a dinner party recently. I do not eat fish and reluctantly (to be polite) ate a small piece, with the israeli couscous and tomatoes. It was fabulous and I am now going to serve it at my next dinner party (different guests of course). I will use wild salmon, no question about it.

As for the cous-cous, I found that Bird's Eye Pasta (can be found on the ethnic foods aisle, Mexican) works just as well and is much easier to find in your regular grocery store. It also pairs well with roasted asparagas. All in all, a very good dish!

WOW! What an argument! Noticing that only 65% would make this again, I went to read the comments. If you look at the fork rating, more than 65% of those who made the recipe really liked it!

I finally found time to make this recipe and was really pleased with the results. The tomatoes and oregano oil really make this dish. I started not to make it because of the low rating but once I read all the reviews about the recipe, not the wild v's farmed debate, I changed my mind and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. I followed the recipe without any substitutions. When I make it again, I think I'm going to have garlic roasted mashed potatoes instead of the couscous.

It's late June and the perfect time to make this. Wild salmon is abundant and reasonably priced, I have a bumper crop of grape tomatoes off the vine, and my basil and oregano are doing great. This recipe is absolutely superb, and it is worth taking the time to slow roast the tomatoes. I chose to use whole wheat moroccan-style (small) couscous for convenience, and used lime zest and lime juice instead of lemon, but otherwise followed the recipe, with a slight reduction in salt. The four of us raved over it.

This took me awhile to make, but was well worth it. I just used wheat cous cous because I couldn't find the pearl cous cous. It still was delicious.

I made this recipe last weekend for company. Everyone loved it!! I had a hard time finding the pearl (Israeli) couscous....even Whole Foods didn't have it! I had to special order it. I think it's a terrific recipe, one I'm looking forward to making again.

This recipe is awesome! Yes, the wild salmon was a bit expensive but well worth it. I added a bit of red pepper flakes to the couscous per other comments. This could easily be served in a restaurant for double the price it cost to fix at home.

i had to special order the pearl couscous from my local gourmet shop and wait for fresh wild salmon at the fish monger but thought this was important in order to rate THIS recipe. the result? it was good - not great - but then i am not a huge lover of salmon (i eat it because it's good for me!) my husband, who loves salmon, thought it was wonderful. the only thing i did differently, stealing from jean-george vonerichten's "cooking with a four star chef": i slow cooked the salmon in a 250 degree oven for about 45 minutes (i had one big piece of fish). i find this method to be more forgiving than a 500 degree oven and i am less likely to end up with over done fish. all in all - worth making again.

Dear Venice cook-you can get wild salmon at Santa Monica Seafood. Wild Chinook Salmon has been running between $18-$21 a pound

For fish lovers who are willing to pay up to $15 a pound more for wild salmon, a word of caution: wild salmon is currently OUT OF SEASON! From November through mid-April, wild salmon is virtually unobtainable fresh. The New York Times ran an expose' in yesterday's paper about unscrupulous merchants charging exorbitant prices for bogus fish. (The Times paid for high-tech DNA testing of sample fish from 8 high-end fish purveyors. Only two of the samples were the real deal.) You can't tell by looking at the fish which is which. If you're used to eating the real thing, however, you can certainly taste the difference. Caveat Emptor!

Haven't made this dish yet, but will, soon as I get a chance to fish for one of those "Non-Existant" Wild Salmon we don't have here in Oregon, USA! People need to research their info a little better before making such silly remarks! A very good place to get wild Chinook or King Salmon is from Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle, Washington. Call them at 1-800-334-2669 to place your order, or visit them online at: http://www.cityfish.com/ I use them as their prices are the best I've found.

Before rating a recipe people need to first make the dish and follow the instructions with all of the ingredients. It's not fair to leave things out and substitute others and then say it was not good.

I made this dish with Wild Salmon (from the U.S.) and it was great! I never write reviews but I think this recipe has a bad rap. The only minor change I made was that I did not saute the garlic and herbs before adding to the tomatoes since they were spending 2+ hrs baking anyway. They were extremely flavorful and so was the couscous. My boyfriend said it was one of my best meals (and I'm in culinary school and cook a lot!)

Good stuff, even with ecologically unsounds farmed salmon (the wild variety was sold out when I got to the market--perhaps too many epicurious readers in town). The tomatoes (roasted by burning several pounds of coal in my local power plant, I am sure) were the hit of the meal. The couscous was a bit bland, but not so much that the meal suffered. Served with a very quick-blanched spinach, tossed with butter, which came off as a nice complement both visually and in flavor. After dinner, we enjoyed our chemical-laden hot tub, kept warm by burning more hydrocarbons during a pleasant but slightly chilly night.

To HelenKing - what does you living in Provence or going to Hotel Management School in Switzerland have to do with anything you said? There are no wild salmon in the US? Ever been fishing in the Pacific Northwest? Lastly, why not serve salmon with cous cous? Why only rice? And why do you think yu have any say in what other people print/cook/eat?

I have now made this dish twice. Both times it was delicious, the second time more so because I better understood the intent of the final product. (Use whatever salmon you wish and it will still be delicious -- screw the political debate.) p>The second time I made it I added about four teaspoons of very finely minced sun-dried tomatoes to the couscous. This added a touch more tang and complexity to the pasta base, an improvement on an already superb dish. The slow-roasted tomatoes are divine. This dish overall is destined to be added to my regular rotation, in moderation.

I actually MADE this recipe and it was delicious. I made it exactly as written, my husband said he loved it and the different textures "made" the dish. Will add more garlic to the tomatoes next time though. I bought the wild salmon at Whole Foods and it was priced only slightly higher than farmed salmon (12.99/lb which is pretty reasonable for New York City).

I am a graduate of the Hotel Management School of Lausanne. What are you telling people about in the U.S. about wild Salmon? There are a few let in Canada, there are none left in the US. I am now living in the Provence. What does Couscous have to do with salmon? Serve rice with it! A few tomatoes okay but I thought the whole thing was a disaster.

Earth2sky: Is there a Wild Oats market in your area? They have wonderful (but espensive) wild salmon in season, alongside the farmed stuff. Meanwhile, check out the OpEd page of the LA times for a summation of the energy industry's assault on wild salmon fisheries in the Pacific Northwest. (I'm rating the recipe just so I won't throw off the average. It sounds good.)

Haven't made it yet, because I was hoping to find someone in SoCal who knows where I can get Wild salmon, because I've never seen it here (must just mean I'm not looking in the right places.) I figured--"heck there's 17 reviews...someone HAD to have mentioned it." Instead, I got bombarded with long dissertations about the evils of wild vs. farm-raised salmon. Too bad most of you don't care as passionately about humanity. I agree with capigatti from New York. Enough with the PC bs and just freakin rate the recipe or ask a relevant question. Now then. Can anyone in SoCal recommend a fish market or maybe a specialty market (?) where I can find wild salmon? I just haven't found it anywhere! Thanks!

I had been looking for a way to cook pearl couscous and was happy this recipe came along. I did not make the salmon but I made the tomatoes and the couscous. Both were very good and I will make this again.

Would everyone get off their p.c. high horse and just write if it tasted good or not? If I want an opinion on farm raised vs. wild, I wouldn't go to a COOKING website. Jeez

This recipe was a great success! I find it amusing though how everyone knows that wild salmon is better than farmed yet we continue to eat 'farmed' animals that are factory produced like chicken, cattle and swine. We continue to let our government and Boards (dairy, beef, chicken, etc) support and push factory farming. We neglect our small farmers or organic farmers. Vote smart, Buy smart, eat healthy!

My guests certainly enjoyed this dish and I would make it again. Definitely use wild salmon - farmed salmon have a high content of sea lice (check out Alexandra Morton's site on her research)www.bcwf.bc.ca AND www.raincoastresearch.org/about.htm

I would always rather use natural, organic and fresh foods when cooking. This is not always possible when you live in smaller ciyies like Pocatello. Wild salmon is better, however, the wild populations will not be able to sustain the ever more intensive harvesting that will take place in the future. If you like fish like salmon, start working to make the farming rules and regulations more favorable to the consumer and cook.

Don't believe everything you read or see unless you investigate both sides, especially WHERE and by WHOM these investigations on Farmed vs Wild Salmon come from. You'd be amazed who they are funded by and ironic how it turns out.. http://www.nfi.org/?a=news&b=News%20Releases&x=2216 Great Website..

Wonderful blending of flavors and ingredients! As with most recipes, I used less oil than called for. Thanks for providing a forum that allows comments, questions & answers on food-related subjects. For those interested in using the most healthful, "environmentally sound" fish when cooking, check out "seafood watch" on Monterey Bay Aquaruim's website.

Farm raised salmon are kept in grossly overcrowded areas and are given steroids to force them to grow larger, faster. These conditions are not only unsafe and cruel to the fish, but common sense reminds us that we are what we eat, and that this is not healthy for us.

In response to Coyotemoon in Arlington, re wild salmon vs. farmed salmpn: Farmed salmon contain toxic substances like PCBs or Polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs are mixtures of up to 209 individual chlorinated compounds (known as congeners). There are no known natural sources of PCBs. PCBs are either oily liquids or solids that are colorless to light yellow. PCBs have been used as coolants and lubricants in transformers, capacitors, and other electrical equipment because they don't burn easily and are good insulators. The manufacture of PCBs was stopped in the U.S. in 1977 because of evidence they build up in the environment and can cause harmful health effects. However, PCBs persist in the environment. Fish absorb PCBs from contaminated sediments and from their food. -Fishmeal/Feed: Studies found that the fishmeal fed to farmed salmon is highly contaminated with PCBs -Farmed salmon are "fatter": Farmed salmon are generally bigger in size and contain more fat than wild salmon. PCBs are stored in fat and remain there for an extended period of time, therefore farmed salmon contain more PCBs. Don't give up fish and salmon completely. It is a known fact that fish and salmon offer benefits in heart health. The benefits to heart health may outweigh the risk of getting cancer from eating farmed salmon. Practise the following: -Trim the skin and the visible fat as PCBs are stored in the fat portion -Prepare your salmon to reduce a significant portion of fat such as grilling and broiling -Try canned salmon as almost all of them are wild salmon

It isn't an ecological question; it as a health one. Wild salmon has not been fed dyed food to make its flesh red, and does not have as much fat. However, it does not taste as good as farmed because of the less fat. Who knows how much dye goes into the flesh and if the part of the dye that is metabolized through the fish liver and makes it to the flesh is acutally harmful. My educated guess is that it is not harmful. Wild salmon frequently return from an Alaskan fishing trip as frozen (yuck); also, the fish has swam upstream for miles, the flesh is broken down, and there is no more fat, just unflavorful mush. This does sound like a good recipe, I will try it but without the couscous, adding sauteed fennel or roasted spaghetti squash instead; lowering carbs is a good thing, just look at our new food pyramid!

The salmon aquaculture industry has been under attack for quite a few years now. Not only is the aquaculture practice ecologically unsound, but the fish is also possibly the most contaminated fish you can buy on the market today. The problem is 1) the type of feed that is used and 2) the amount of ditritus that the fish swims in, eats, and then needs to dispose of. The whole industry is a filthy mess. On the other hand, the wild caught salmon industry has done much to improve their fishing practices. The salmon are not endanger of being over fished, and their environment (primarily the temp of the water) makes for a better tasting and healthier fish.

Answer to Arlington, VA... Wild salmon is just that - wild. Farm raised salmon are fed carcinogenic chemicals. Wild is by far a better choice.

another honest response to this recipe - wild salmon is surely more ecologically sound than farmed salmon! (read any scientific report/website to find out about the myriad problems with farmed salmon). but the ecological benefit is far outweighed by the 2+ hour tomato roasting! burning hydrocarbons (most of what we use for roasting) is the greatest scourge of our environment, by all accounts. there may be a way to make this recipe with solar power in some areas, but DONT DO IT if you're relying on gas or electricity.

Farmed salmon are loaded with chemicals like red dye to make them look better and anitbiotics to help them stave off the diseases that come from their close confinement. But today's New York Times will provide an even better reason not to support farmed fish: http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/national/30Fish.html?pagewanted=print&position=

Just an honest question: Why is it ecologically sound to go for wild salmon over farm?
