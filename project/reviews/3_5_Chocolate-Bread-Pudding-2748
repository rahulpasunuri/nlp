I have been looking for this great pudding recipe since I lost my original mag years ago. Everyone raved about it then and gave three cheers when I told them I found it again! Eat!

Very easy to make. I should have added more chocolate like the previous reviewers but I had a creme anglaise sauce so it was a nice balance. Very chocolately but NOT too sweet. I had mixed in around 6 OZ of milk chocolate chips when I was folding the bread and pudding. It was a nice touch. I also added 1/4 C of Godiva chocolat liquor which was excellent, it added just a hint of adult taste. Next time, I would use bitter sweet chcolate and a ful 1/2 C of the liquor.

This is a good recipe if you make the right changes. I left out the cinnamon and the Kahlua. I used twice the amount of chocolate because it seemed like previous reviewers did not think it had enough chocolate in it. After doing all that, it turned out well and it is really easy to make.

Very good and easy! No egg separating or water bath needed: yay! Large quantity info: Multiplied by 12 to fill three 2" hotel pans. Served about 100 on small dessert plates. Used 6 16 ounce sleeves of regular white bread. Eliminated coffee liquor (didn't need to replace liquid). Very chocolatey, not too sweet.

This is creamy and smooth, but it is not a chocolate lover's delight. I was a little hesitant of putting in the cinnamon and rightly so. The cinnamon overtook the flavor for me. I agree with the other cook that you should leave out the Kahula and maybe use some Cream de Cocoa (chocolate Liqueur). I guess I was looking for something different.

Sinful and delicious! We used half and half instead of the cream to cut down on fat and it was still plenty rich. In fact, next time I'm going to try just whole milk. We also put a little whipped cream and drizzled chocolate sauce over the top (which I guess canceled out any fat savings from the half and half)! Oh well!

I love this recipe. I have made it many times because it is so delicious and easy.

I used chocolate ice cream with walnuts to substitute the milk and chocolate mixture, since I didn't have milk/ the chocolate at the time. It worked perfectly fine and it had a good texture!! My fiance loved it and next time I will put more liquid to the bread.

I made this recipe with the bread I regularly save from leftover rolls and stale bread loafs. A great recipe to make in a pinch, for the stocked kitchen, because it requires so little labor. I also modified a typical whiskey sauce to make a very complatible Kahlua sauce.

I made a couple of changes to this recipe to better suit me entertaining needs and it was great! As I only needed to serve four people after a large meal, I cut the receipe in half and I substituted Godiva choclate liquor in place of the Kaluha. It is now a new family favourite!

It needed a little more liquid to make it soak trhough the bread. Family loved it.

This is a great recipe!! The only adjustment I made was to omit the Kahlua and substitute more milk - and in one case, a little coffee creamer. It is delicious!
