As a lover of corn meal this recipe ranks high. So many "cornmeal" cakes incorporate so little cornmeal but not this one. The grapes work well with this but I'm about to remake this dish with ripe plums and I'm thinking many fruits (peaches, pears, etc.) would pair well with the cornmeal, buttermilk and honey.
