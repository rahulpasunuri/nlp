This is the sort of thing I make because my kid likes it (and I don't say that condescendingly...I NEED some things that my kid likes). It gets the job done, but I'm not going to be craving it.

Be careful how long you cook the crust because it cooks faster than the recipe. Mine was a little too crispy. Otherwise good.

I made this dish for a quick dinner. Everyone cleaned their plates, including my picky 5 year old. I will certainly make it again when I need something quick and delicious.

I'd tried this which when served went perfectly as a comfort food. Added crumbled breakfast sausage and chopped brocolli crowns for both presentation and heartiness. Really is a keeper.
