These are really good! I did double the cream cheese mixture, as others suggested, then extended the cooking time to 50 minutes. Omitted nuts and almond extract (for taste preference only). Moist and tender, so delicious. Not sure why some reviewers had trouble...

Really yummy! I used semi-sweet chocolate b/c it was all I had, plus I had to bake it for about 45 minutes, not 30.

These brownies are so tasty! They are fluffy, just sweet enough, and very creamy. The cream cheese paired with the chocolate is divine, neither overpowers the other. So good, I will make these again and again.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I cook a lot and this sounded good but didn't turn out to taste that great. I thought that there were too many different flavors in the recipe. All I could taste was the almond extract which is surprising because not much is in the recipe. It may of tasted better without the almond extract but I don't think I will try this again. I've made cream cheese brownie's before from a box recipe and they tasted much better then these. I guess sometimes it doesn't pay to make them from scratch. I don't recommend this recipe.

Back in college, I used to love the rich fudgy cream cheese brownies sold at Tufts' student center. These are the closest to that recipe I have ever found. Thanks you but my hips aren't so happy.

Yikes! Maybe I did something wrong, but these were quite a mess. Rather than being a fudgy brownie, it was more like a melted chocolate bar with some chocolate cake mixed in. Even after I let them cool, they were definitely not what I was expecting. I should have known something was wrong when the batter was so thick as I was pouring it into the pan. The cream cheese portion though was great. I think I will use the swirl with a different brownie recipe and see if that improves things.

These were fabulous! When I was making them I was grumbling cause the extra steps with the cream cheese (you know - the holidays no extra time) but they were so amazingly tasty it was worth it! OK - here were my tweaks: no nuts,doubled the cream cheese swirl as suggested by other reviewer and just did the brownie layer on the bottom and the cream cheese on the top. Also, baked for 50 min instead of 30. Yummy! We are brownie lovers in our family and these were given kudos by all. Definitely a keeper!

I have made these brownies quite a few times and if your looking for something a little diffrent then you've found it. My husband loves them and if I'm going to bring something to someones house this always gets great reviews. To catagorize these I would say they are cakey to fudge like and not chewy at all. Be advised these have a cream cheese swirl NOT cheesecake so don't expect any cheesecake results.

We thought the brownies were delicious. I found the cooking time a little too short and increased the time. My husband suggested doubling the cheesecake ingredients for more impact but he is a cheesecake fan. I used English chocolate called bourneville from Cadbury's which is very dark, regular choc chips, very finely chopped pecans but will use walnuts for more texture next time. Very satisfactory so many levels! ;-)

I have to agree with the three other reviewers who say this brownie is too dry. I followed the directions exactly, and the chocolate part was clumpy and dry. The cream cheese "swirl" did not happen. It was more like a mixed up layer of cream cheese on top of the brownie mixture. Why did this happen to me, when so may others claim this is the best brownie they have ever made? Why? Why? Why? I'll keep looking for my favorite brownie recipe.

I made this for a wedding shower recently and everyone loved it! This recipe is super chocolaty and the brownies come out very thick, almost like ones you find in a bakery. It was super easy and I would certainly make this again.

I have been making a version of this recipe for over 20 years from a Better Homes and Garden cookbook received as a bridal shower gift. Every time I make these I have requests for the recipe. These are easy - use any good dark or bittersweet chocolate (chocolate chips in a pinch). I would omit the additional chips added to the batter. As for the swirl - making a decorative design is almost impossible. I usually double this recipe for a 9 X 13 pan but do not double the number eggs for the cream cheese layer to make it easier to 'marble' together. A nice suggestion is to add strong expresso coffee or coffee liquer to dress these up. The suggestion of Chambord is wonderful - I have also made these with orange liquer and served with sliced strawberries splashed with orange liquer then topped with whipped cream. I am under obligation to make these every year for the American booth at the school International festival here in Switzerland. This is a favorite amongst my family and friends all over the world.

This is just my honest opinion, so don't take it too seriously. These "brownies" just didn't do anything for me. The flavor was very moderate; I've had better brownies from a bag. It had no definite texture or flavor. When most people think of a brownie, they would think of something dense, rich, fudgy and somewhat chewy. This, was really quite bland, compared to most chocolate deserts I have made in the past, and the texture was a bit too soft and tender for my liking. As for the swirl, it's really up to the chef to produce an attractive design with it. I was able to achieve a sort of swirl effect, but you really have to reserve some of the brownie batter to prevent the two batters from blending together due to overmixing. While it didn't look bad, the flavor is far overpowered by the chocolate batter.

Instead of Cream Cheese, like a Kraft or Philly, I used mascarpone cheese. I also folded-in some Chambord raspberry liqueur-- a few splashes. Them some fresh raspberries. After "turning them out" of the pan after cooking, I cut them on a diagonal. As a 31 year old guy-- and all thumbs-- if I can make this anyone can. For you Chicago folks, Trader Joes has cheap premium bulk chocolate.

I just used the cream cheese swirl portion of the recipe and added it to a box of good brownie mix. It tasted great, but the cream cheese swirl floated over the choco brownie batter which was odd. Nevertheless, the brownies were AOK. Would bake 'em again.

These brownies are very rich, but delicious. I made them for a party and they were gone in minutes. I think the key to making the "swirl" work is not to drag the knife over the top too much. I will definitely hang on to this recipe.

The swirl didn't really do it for me so I just made it a layered cream cheese brownie, spreading the cream cheese mixture on the top and sprinkling with chocolate chips. Turns out great EVERY TIME. It's easily double and quadrupled for parties and I've always gotten rave reviews.

I made this for a Christmas party and got rave reviews. It will be a new standard. I made a few tweaks which I think helped: only used 4 oz. of sweet chocolate plus 2 of bittersweet and instead of 1 c. of chocolate chips, used 1/2 cup of finely chopped semisweet chocolate bar (ghiradelli). The chocoate pieces were still evident, but not overpowering and the overall sweetness was just right. To the cook who didn't know what sweet chocolate is, it's in a green box and should be right with the rest of the baking chocolate.

I expected this brownies to turn out good, but it didn't. I think I did 2 things wrong: 1) I didn't use "sweet baking chocolate"; 2) I probably beat the egg and sugar too long for the batter, though I thought I only beat them for 2 minutes. Anyway, the result is a slightly dry brownies. It took about 40 minutes to bake it. By the way, what is "sweet baking chocolate", I thought chocolate ranges from unsweetened, bittersweet and semi-sweet, hmm, maybe I should look harder in the stores? Is it available in the grocery store?

This is a really good recipe to play with! I used unsweetened chocolate because that is what I had! The cream cheese topping is wonderful. The comment earlier about the brownies being dry is only because they were overbaked. Never bake them the time in a recipe!! Mine were moist and the cream cheese wonderful!!

Rating: 3
FIVE forks for taste! They're delicious! But, only THREE for texture. They're moist... sticky moist. The chocolate chips weren't absorbed by the batter they way I thought they would have been. Instead, there were sticky pools of chocolate throughout. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Just not my taste. ;o) My only change: I used toasted almonds instead of walnut because I'm not a fan of walnuts and used a glass pan, well greased, because I don't own a non-stick.

I was very disappointed with these brownies. They came out extremely dry and they weren't sweet enough. I would not recommend them.

This recipe was okay. Since it only yields 16 brownies (I got 20 out of it), I recommend making it for dinner or a small function. The brownies were softer than other brownies I've made, and I noticed the consistency was very mushy the next day. The cream cheese mixture was very thin. My impression from the recipe is that it would be thicker. They were okay, not great.

Used semi sweet chips and semi sweet baking choc. and baked in 8" round pan so I could cut into wedges (for something different). I too also had no 'swirl' happening. Very good brownie.

This recipe was a huge hit. I left the almond extract out. Defintely will make this again.

These were a little sweet for me, and the swirl was (as the person below said) more of a melange, but they were a huge hit with everyone else. I doubled the walnuts, which I'd do again, and next time I think I'd go with bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate to make them more to my own taste. But easy, and definitely a hit with people. They got scarfed at worked really quickly.

These were great! The first time I made them with the peanut butter chips as suggested. The second time I used milk chocolate instead of sweet baker's chocolate and then reverted to semi-sweets instead of peanut butter. That was the best combination. Also I used a little bigger dish--7 x 11 and it worked great. I really reccommend these!!

This was delicious, but I had limited success creating any definite swirl -- it was just a melange, really. But the flavor was excellent, very rich. It was also easy to make. I will make this again.

Excellent brownies. I substituted cocoa, more sugar, and shortening for the sweetened chocolate and it came out fine. I cooked it for 35 minutes and I still feel like they were a bit too moist. These were a hit, though, over Easter, but they are best served cold and in small portions; they are rich.

I made these brownies, but I never tried them because of my diet. However, I was asked to make these again and this time I will try them. Everyone says they loved them. They seemed very moist and fudgy. I loved the fact that there are chocolate chips in them- I always put chocolate chips in my brownies.

I am not a big brownie fan (but I am a chocoholic)but these are the best brownies I ever had. I love them. Really fudgy. I used semi sweet chocolate instead of the bakers sweet chocolate and they were fabulous. I did have a hard time swirling the batter so I just put the brownie stuff on the bottom and the cream cheese stuff on top and sort of swirled it together. Yum!

I'm rating it "Just so-so", due to the fact that someone made it for me and I did not do it myself. The brownies were "fudgy" and I prefer them to be more like cake. I'll have to bake them myself and see how they turn out
