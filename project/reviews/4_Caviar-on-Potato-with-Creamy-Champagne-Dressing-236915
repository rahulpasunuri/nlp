a recipe I chose for our Gourmet Supper Club menu last night. I did not make it but assigned it to someone else. FABULOUS!!!!!!! Oh, we did about a 1/2 cup of champagne because well...we were drinking it!

I made just the dressing as I was looking for something to do with leftover NYE champagne. The dressing is yummy! I used lowfat sour cream, but otherwise followed the recipe and it's delicious. I had this with chilled asparagus. I look forward to making it with the potatoes and caviar.

Another vessel to use is a 2 ounce sherry glass. Made a caviar parfait using this recipe's dressing for my potatoes although I only needed 1 tater for 8 servings. Placed the dressed potatoes as the bottom layer, followed by a minced 9 minute hard boiled egg layer. Followed by minced shallots, a layer of caviar,creme fraiche ( to replace the sour cream) and a small dollop of caviar to finish..sorta like cherry. I used a 4 ounce tin of caviar which made for distinctive layers and a beautiful presentation. Oh yes and wooden forks are reasonable in price, look nice on the table and more readily available than spoons.

I was so inspired by the presentation idea that I went to search for a source for beautiful jewel-toned gelato tasters that I'd seen at an ice cream store. I found them at a site called villadolcegelato "dot" com, but I'm not sure I can use 6 thousand of them! If you're a stickler for presentation, you might want to check them out. Very pretty.
