I love the pairing of cranberry and cherry, but just as a warning, the clove flavor of this recipe is very strong -- too strong for the palates of some of my family members. I use 1/2 cup sugar, and cut way back on the cloves. I make this every year...delicious!

I.LOVED.THIS. RECIPE!!!! And the longer it sat in the fridge - the more moist and plump the cherries became. The combination of the cranberries, cherries and cloves is wonderful! I will make this again and again and again....

This is super easy and very tasty. Definitely use "tart" dried cherries. I used dried cherries that were not tart the first time and the sauce was too sweet. Tart cherries make it perfectly delicious!

This is my favorite cranberry sauce. I won't go a year without making it, and it has graced my Thanksgiving table for the last 10 years. Love this stuff. It's a great recipe as is, but I like to add 1 tablespoon of orange zest to give it a nice citrus kick. It's also awesome over vanilla ice cream, yammers.

Just great; a nice twist to traditional cranberry sauce for the Thanksgiving meal; I've been making it for many years now, my family insists upon it! Yum!

So far, the best cranberry sauce I've ever made! These are my tiny changes: used straight-up apple cider, and as someone mentioned below, cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup as my "tart" cherries seemed to be on the sweeter side. The sauce had the right amount of tart - not so sweet that it could be confused as jam.

Rating: 2
As with many other reviewers, I felt this sauce was missing something until a few "tweaks". I used 1/2 the amount of cloves, which was plenty, but it woke up when I added a teaspoon of orange zest and a small sprinkle of ground cardamom (my favorite spice). I doubt I'll make it again as I have two much better cran sauce recipes.

Have made this 3 or 4 years in a row now. LOVE it. each year I think about making it more than once per year. WE have used different juices and I think it doesn't really mater. This year we used a pomegranate blend. I agree with another post, that it is great over vanilla ice cream. Friends and family rave over it.

Making this for the third year running this year. It is fantastic. Serving duck instead of turkey for a change, I think this will be absolutely brilliant on the side.

This is an exceptional recipe. The cloves give a traditionally American recipe a touch of the exotic. I use Cape Cod fresh cranberries bought in bulk, not the Oceanspray packaged variety that tend to be small and tasteless. I use Knudsen's "Just Black Cherry" juice found in most supermarkets and most health food stores. I use only Bing cherries (unsweetened and unsulfured). They are very expensive but worth every dollar. I have not altered the recipe with added touches and it comes out beautifully. You can use it over Vanilla Bean ice cream, good plain yogure (Fage or Stonyfield) or with game meat (venison) or poultry.

If I have any leftover, I mix it with tart apples and bake in a pie....beautiful and delicious. I have made this with stevia, instead of sugar and it works very well.

I'm not usually a big fan of cranberry sauce, but I gave this recipe a try last year for Thanksgiving. It was a big hit with the whole family. I used less sugar per other recommendations and cherry juice instead of cider. I really like cloves, so I found this to be perfect.

Got lots of compliments with this -- made with cranberry cocktail. For me, I have had better cranberry sauces (usually involving port or the like) but this is still a contender.

Fantastic! I looked at other reviews and made the following modifications: *1/3 cup sugar *substituted cranberry-apple juice (all-natural and non-sweetened) as couldn't find cherry cider *1 cinnamon stick *1 tsp orange zest *1/8 tsp cloves, you can even omit Once you make this recipe you'll never look for another! Thanks Epicurious!

Rating: 4
I prepared this as an accompaniment to our Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. Everyone at the table asked for the recipe and even the children enjoyed it. I substituted 1 cup of apple cider and used cranberry juice cocktail for the remainder. I also dropped 3-4 whole cloves in after it reached the simmer point. A few shakes of cinnamon and the zest of a medium naval orange and the sauce was complete. I would serve this over pork as well as chicken in addition to turkey and will make it more often. It is just too good to only serve it on holidays!

Rating: 4
What can I really add to 106 prior reviews except to check in with my approval. I used Michigan Montmorency cherry juice instead of cherry cider or cranberry juice and it seemed to work fine. Would agree with those who suggested a bit less sugar. And I like the idea of adding some orange zest or even finely chopped orange peel. But make no mistake, the recipe stands well on its own.

I really like plain old cranberry sauce, but this Thanksgiving thought I would give this a try -- next year it's back to the old fashion cranberry sauce. I think this would be great over ice cream or over brie. I used only 1/4 C sugar, soaked the cherries overnight in brandy so it wasn't overly sweet --- but the taste of the cherries overwhelmed any taste of cranberries.

Rating: 4
This is a favorite of ours and I make it annually! True strength of flavor and delicious no matter if you eat it alone, next to a slice of turk, or as a dessert! I also use orange zest in this recipe - just a 1/2 teaspoon or so accents the recipe perfectly. YUM!

Rating: 1
I thought I would love this recipe because I love dried cherries, but I should have known I might not like the recipe because of the cloves. I don't mind cloves as a background flavor, but I feel this recipe has too much of a clove flavor (and I even put in only half the amount called for). I'm now searching for another cranberry sauce recipe for Thanksgiving!

Rating: 0
I have been making this since it was published in 1998 and I love the spiciness of the cloves with the cranberries. I have experimented with it over the years and prefer the addition on some orange zest and a splash of orange juice to brighten the flavors. I also put it over vanilla ice cream...yum!

My family loves to experiment on Thanksgiving with new recipes. We tried this one four years ago and it has appeared each Thanksgiving since then- we love it that much. IF you have leftovers, take a sheet of puff pastry, place a round of gouda (not smoked) or edam in the center and top with 1/2 cup of this sauce. Pull the sides of pastry up around the cheese and twist into a decorative top. Place on a greased sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Serve as an appetizer with apples- it will WOW everyone!!

Unfortunately I used dried currants instead of dried cherries, and the texture was too...mealy, I guess, because currants are so small. Use cherries!

I made this recipe exactly as written and was disappointed with the results. I felt that the cherries overpowered the taste of the cranberries. However I added a few ingredients that made it explode with flavor. In a saucepan, I reduced a cup of red wine (I used Zinfandel, although any red wine would do just fine) with another cup of fresh cranberries as well as the zest of one orange. I added these ingredients to the original recipe and it was perfect. My guests all complimented the flavor of this dish. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving in the years to come.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was fine fully prepared one day ahead. This was my favorite dish on the table! It was really good --- sweeter than the plain cranberry sauce I'm used to, but less sweet than the cranberry/raspberry sauce you can buy canned. The cherries were just delicious! I couldn't find any cherry cider so I used the cranberry juice. I read the other reviews before I began and took another cook's advice to use half a cup of sugar rather than the whole cup --- a good decision. I also took the advice to use 1/8 tsp of cloves rather than 1/4 tsp. Next time, I'll try the whole 1/4. I highly recommend this recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
it's delicious and smells heavenly. i followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. which i thought was still too much. i used almost 1/4 t. cloves, which was too overpowering. i would definitely reduce it to 1/8 next time. the cloves are must though.

I make this at least once a year and everyone loves it. I use dried Rainier cherries with Cherry juice.

Rating: 3
I see where the problem lies with the sweetness issue some people brought up. Checking the labels on the the various juices came up with surprising variations in sugar content. KNUDSEN CHERRY CIDER: 30 grams; OCEAN SPRAY CRANBERRY JUICE COCKTAIL: 35 grams; 365 BRAND 100% BLACK CHERRY JUICE: 50 grams; 365 BRAND 100% CRANBERRY JUICE: 7 grams. I used the cherry cider at 30 grams and cut back on the sugar and cloves. After cooking it a bit, I had to add more of both. So I guess I ended up with using the amounts called for. Also, I used TART dried cherries, which are not as sweet as the others. I liked it.

I've never had a dish of cranberry sauce disappear until now! The cherry really gives it an edge. Took other's advice and cut the sugar (I only used 1/3 - 1/2 cup) and it was great. I used an 1/8 tsp of cloves (previous suggestions) and thought it could have used a bit more - definitely didn't overpower. I also let it cook longer to start the thickening, as I hate runny sauce. Trader Joe's had the dried tart cherries and the cherry cider.

Made it for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. I used an immersion blender to blend it a bit - just because I like a smoother cranberry sauce, but still left some chunks of cranberry and cherry. It will be a new Thanksgiving staple.

Awesome recipe, made this two years in a row now with a couple tweaks. I dropped the cloves down to 1/8 teaspoon as it over-powered the cranberries. I added a cinnamon stick while simmering for added spice, and I used a teaspoon or fresh orange zest for depth. This keeps for a long time in the frisge, great on toast or by itself!

I am a cherry nut, so I knew I'd like this recipe. I used black cherry juice w/no sugar added, couldn't find cider. Used 1/2 cup sugar & 1/8 tsp cloves, like others suggested. Even hubby, the non-cranberry sauce lover thought it was great. Wish I had made it a few days earlier like others suggested, & glad I had cut back on the cloves, was just perfect. I had enought to can for future turkey feasts, will be great with pork & chicken. Am giving it as Xmas gifts. Thanks for the recipes & review tips!

This is so so good! Has become my new Thanksgiving favorite. Used Trader Joe's Cherry Cider, only a pinch of cloves and broke in 1 cinnamon stick. Needs to cook about 10 minutes longer to get thick. Huge hit among non-cranberry sauce lovers as well. Make this--you won't be sorry!

Wonderful! Have never liked cranberries until now. I used just a pinch of clove, and that was all I needed. Everyone loved this! I also simmered much longer, as it seemed to have too much liquid. Given the longer simmer, I think I lost some of the brighter color, but loved the smell, and this was still was great addition to the Thanksgiving menu.

I have never liked cranberry sauce but my husband went crazy when he learned I had no plans to have cranberries with the Thanksgiving dinner. Anyway, I tried this recipe and have to say, it was a huge success. My husband and his family loved it and I even thought it was tasty. The cranberries do a great job cutting down on the tartness of the cranberries and the cloves add an interesting and delicious dimension to the sauce. Like one of the reviewers before me, I couldn't find cherry cider so used Cran-Cherry juice. It worked very well. We'll definitely be using this recipe in the future.

This is the best cranberry sauce recipe I've found yet. Someone said to fish the cloves out of the sauce but it calls for gound cloves...so no fishing!

I will make again soon for our "Christmas in July" dinner!

Taking a cue from some of the reviews that said the cloves were overpowering, and merging this recipe with another cranberry/cherry sauce recipe that used allspice + cinnamon instead of cloves, I made a new version: The cranberries and cherries as called for in the recipe. 1 cup unsweetened cranberry juice (it's what I had in the house. I was not about to go on a shopping expedition for the cider.) 1 cup more or less of golden brown sugar, 5 whole cloves, 1 small cinnamon stick. AMAZING. Good thing I made 2 batches because the first was depleted before we even got to the table for dinner. Even my brother-in-law who won't eat anything that isn't Italian loved it. You might want to consider steeping the cloves in the liquid then fishing them out before adding the other ingredients so that no one bites into a whole clove.

Perfect!!! I doubled the recipe and added a bit of cinnamon and WAH-Lah! It was sinfully delicious! I recommend using cherry cider and whole pitted dried cherries- not the bits. Everyone loved it! They all want it for Christmas dinner!

This is a nice recipe. The biggest shock I got while preparing it was the amount of sugar the sauce calls for: one cup! While I'm aware a lot of people like their holiday cranberry sauce super-sweet, this is an exorbitant amount of sugar (especially with the already-sweetened dried cherries). I used a quarter of a cup of sugar and it was definitely sweet enough. The cloves overpowered the dish a little bit, but lent a very nice, festive flavor.

I make this every year. It is wonderful. While it is hot, I pour it into prepared jam jars and seal. It allows me to make a lot in advance without taking up space in the fridge. It also makes shipping it very easy. Great for gift giving. Stores in jars in pantry for over a year.

Guess I'm the only disenting opinion here. Even by reducing the amount of cloves required in this recipe, my scant 1/8 teaspoon still overwhelmed...nothing but cloves.
