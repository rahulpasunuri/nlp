The cornmeal cookie is outstanding! Twice I have lost the recipe, but fortunately I can find it again on the website. It sells at bakesales; friends love it with wine such as a good Port; I take it on picnics. The key is to chill the dough and don't over-knead the dough. I also add a little fresh lemon juice as well as the lemon peel to add zip. Also, be sure to look for jumbo golden raisins which you soak ahead of time to plump up. Enjoy!

I'll hold off on rating this since I only tried the cookies, not the zabaglione (I'll save that for when I have a friend over). At least when I tried the recipe, the cookie dough was very crumbly and didn't hold together that well. I had to add oil to make it moist enough to stick together. They come out pretty yummy, though... a crunchy shortbread-like texture, as I expected from the dry dough.

To the Cook from Chapel Hill. Once the egg yolks reach 160 degrees they should be fine. Its best to cook eggs to 145 degrees for 15 seconds to ensure that the bacteria are killed.

Good, but the wine flavor was a little overpowering. Anybody out there know anything about the food safety of eating these incompletely cooked eggs?

My first try I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Very good. Next time I'm trying dried blueberries.
