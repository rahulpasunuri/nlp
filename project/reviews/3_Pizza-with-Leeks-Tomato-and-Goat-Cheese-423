Previous reviewers - Any recipe with only a few simple ingredients means those ingredients must be good quality. Out of season bland tomatoes will take away a third of the quality of this dish. Wonderful dish.

Using pre-made fresh pizza dough makes this recipe come together very quickly. The flavors are wonderful for being such a simple dish.

I made this pizza exactly as prescribed and the all-around feeling was that it is bland. Definitely won't be making this one again.

This is a decent recipe. Good flavors. I used organic sifted spelt flour for the dough with fabulous results. The tomatoes at the grocer store didn't look to whippy this time of year so I opted for canned fire-roasted tomatoes which were delish. I will try this with summer's bounty of fresh tomatoes this year. A pizza stone is a must for all homemade pizza's!

I used a Boboli crust to save time and I have to say the whole thing was a bit bland. Maybe I could have upped the leek factor or added some more tangy ingredients.

Fabulous. I added some slivered basil leaves. Best pizza I ever ate.

Outstanding but use roasted tomatoes in place of fresh for the best pizza you've ever tasted.

I actually made my crust too thin! I didn't have a pizza pan so I used a full sized jelly roll pan. It tasted great, but was a bit floppy. This one was a hit with the significant other and a good use for my fresh leeks.

This was pretty easy to make, and the goat cheese gave it a lot of flavor. The crust came out a little thick and dry, but it was still good. Next time I might drizzle more oil over it or maybe melted butter.

This pizza is colorful and tasty too. I have made it twice and the only thing I changed was to make the crust thinner. I used the same amount of dough, but just rolled it out larger and rolled in the edges to create an overall thinner pizza but with a thicker edge to hold in all the good toppings. The sweetness of the tomatoes and leeks is complemented by the goat cheese. I highly recommend this for a special dinner.
