For a sandwich, this takes a lot of prep for something that tastes only average. Hubby said not to bother again.

This was a huge hit during a Fourth of July party this year. I cut up the sandwiches into small "finger-sized" pieces and they flew of the plate. The flavor of the grilled red onion and using a high quality blue cheese is essential.

This was great...take the time to grill the red onions, the flavor is amazing with the blue cheese. Be sure to use a good fresh sliced smoked turkey, not a pre packaged one.

What a terrific way to not feel guilty about having sandwiches for dinner. The blue cheese made it satisfying and a tad gourmet. Skipped the bc for the kids.
