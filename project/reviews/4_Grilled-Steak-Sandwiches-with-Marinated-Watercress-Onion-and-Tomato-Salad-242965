I have made this recipe for tri tip (without the sandwich) several times this summer. It is always good, however seems to lack a little salt and pepper. I've also added a little worst. sauce to the marinade, which is also good.

This made a delicious quick-prep worknight meal. I used regular (not white) balsamic vinegar and arugula instead of watercress. Everyone raved. Agree that it is important to slice everything very thin.

This is OK but I have other grilled beef recipes I prefer. The cut of meat worked out great. However, I'm not sure of the point of the dressing on the meat. It really doesn't add much flavor. I would prefer a marinade. I believe the sugar ended up burning on the meat. The veggies were a nice touch.

This was great! So flavorful. My husband asks me to make this at least once a week. Sometimes I use arugala to give it a nice peppery taste. Definately a great piece of meat.

I made these sandwiches for a summer birthday party and everyone loved them! It's key to slice the meat very thinly, and make sure the pieces aren't too big, don't want it to all come out in one bite! Some people opted to not have the marinated veggies, but loved the sandwiches anyway. Watercress is a wonderful light change from lettuce.

This was a really good summer prep. I also found a great Korean style prepared Tri at www.thegrilllife.com - very good!

Such a versatile cut of meat, wonder why not more popular. Quick, easy and perfect for summer. Highly recommend.
