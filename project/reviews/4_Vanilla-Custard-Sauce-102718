I forgot to add that it is fabulous with rum added while cooking.

Yummy! I did substitute. I used 1 1/2 c half and half with 4 egg yolks and used bottled vanilla bean paste. It is so good! I am fearful of overcooking the custard and turning it into scrambled eggs so it took me more than 10 minutes to get it to coat the back of a wooden spoon.

This was great! It reminded me of melted vanilla bean ice cream. Absolute heaven!

Tasty. Make sure you scrape the seeds in vanilla bean for more vanilla flavor!

This was my first attempt at a custard sauce. It was very quick and easy to make, and was a big hit. I served with a three berry cake. I used 1 of Penzy's Madagascar whole vanilla beans and couldn't belive the incredible vanilla flavor! It is worth spending extra for good vanilla for this one.
