Not bad tasting but has no resemblance to real Devonshire Cream which has a texture just a bit softer than butter and much richer than this blend. The combination of cream, sour cream and gelatin really doesn't fit with anything except perhaps as a dollop on vegetable. I will import it if needed rather than make this again. It's that different.

Just made this for the last meal of this Christmas weekend to put on strawberries for strawberries devonshire. quick to make, and like the lady before me, I just like the way it tastes! Since we live only about 1hour from Plant City in FLorida, our strawberry season starts in March, and goes on most of the year with either domestic or imported berries. Will keep this as a staple in the frig. oh, I did only put 1/4 cup of sugar (to save on carbs and calories) and 3/4 cups sour cream (because that is all I had), and will use these proportions next time.

I've been making this for about 8 years now, and thought I'd finally write a review. I'm not caught up on what it is called, or whether or not it tastes like true English Devonshire Cream. All I can say is that I throw a lot of tea parties, and I've been making this for a long time now, and EVERYONE ALWAYS LOVES it! I don't have a tea party without it, truly. It is best made the day before, so it has time to set up nicely. I pour it into the bowl I'm going to serve it in, so it sets prettily in it. I usually halve the recipe, though as it makes a lot. I instruct my guests, who always try to spread it like butter on their scone, to just take a spoonful and plop it in! They love it, and so do I. Mind you, I hate whipped cream and sour cream, and anything of the like. But for some reason, I love this... Janene from theweedpatch.typepad.co m

Real Devonshire cream is made from unpasteurized cream (and no other ingredients), which is almost impossible to obtain in North America. You can try this "fake" version, or you can buy the real thing, imported, from larger grocery stores and specialty shops.

It's crap. I've had the real thing and this is NOTHING like it. Make the real thing by putting heavy whipping cream in a double boiler until it is reduced by half, remove it from heat and let it stand for 2 hours then refrigerate it for at least 12 hours. Stirt the "crust" down into the cream--the BEST!

Since I have never tasted Devonshire cream, I really can't compare, but I found that this tasted like sweetened sour cream. If I decide to try it again I will cut down the amount of sour cream, the texture was fluffy though.

This was GREAT! I served this with scones and Lingonberry Preserves on Christmas Day and it was perfect!

It has become harder and harder to find Devonshire cream in the states. This is a great recipe, and it tastes even better homemade then it does in the store versions. It's great on scones with strawberry jam

Never even heard of this type of cream before; it was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! Yes it was a little involved, BUT SOOOO WORTH IT!!! I highly recommend this recipe. -Melissa

We've been making this for years. Always a crowd pleaser -- and now it has the benefit of being low-carb as well. Make it in a ring mold the night before so you can slice it into servings and top with seasonal berries. Unbeatable.

Great with angel food cake and strawberries. I am always worried about the gelatin working. So, I used 1 teaspoon of gelatin, and dissolved it in 2 T. cold water. Then, I add 6 T. of boiling water to the gelatin and stirred until dissolved. This method is similar to what is suggested for the recipes on the Knox gelatin package. I did it this way because I could not tell when the gelatin had been sufficiently heated, as suggested by the original instructions, and I did not want to waste the ingredients if the gelatin did not gel. It worked great!

Everyone remember -> Devonshire Cream is used most for its use on scones in Europe. I went to my bakery and got some wonderful scones, then I steamed them for about 10 minutes (they don't get soggy) and spread some Devonshire Cream on them and some raspberry jam, it tastes authentic. Great recipe.

Wonderfully rich yet slightly tangy at the same time. I made it for a party to go with angel food cake and berries, and more than one person wanted to know what brand yoghurt this was (the Philistines)--apparently it was the best damn' yoghurt they'd ever had in their lives. Definitely a treat for when you want something a bit more special or unusual than regular whipped cream.

This stuff is great on strawberries. Can't wait to make some more!

Mmmmmmm! What a nice flavor and consistency! And the small bit of gelatin really helps stabilize the creams. Very good with the Angel Food Cake (and some great strawberries and a little bowl of soft brown sugar).

I loved this recipe! It's a little involved, but well worth the work. There is just something so special having devon cream at a tea instead of whipped!
