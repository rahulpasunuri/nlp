This was a bit of a disappointment. I was hoping for a treat along the lines of the recipe for seared rainbow chard found on this site, but this is nowhere near as good, even though I used beautiful, fresh scallions. The whole thing got kind of slimy, with a taste I can only describe as vegetal, as in wine that grew on a poorly pruned vine with too many leaves.
