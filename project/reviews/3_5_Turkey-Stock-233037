Made this for gravy -- excellent! I'm giving it 3 forks only because the recipe does not give instructions how to thicken it for gravy. I cut the recipe in half and it still made tons! I added 3 Tablespoons of Madeira to the finished product which enhanced the flavor. For gravy, it needed to be thickend, so I had to play with it. I made a roux using equal parts butter and flour (1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup flour). It wasn't thick enough so I repeated with more roux (another 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 flour). Better but still wasn't thick enough to my liking. Took the gravy to my son's for Thanksgiving hoping to make a bit more roux, but they were out of butter, so we just used as is. It was delicous but next time will need a bit more thickening. Great recipe though and will definitely make it again.

This stock came out so delicious. I was happy to take the time to make it. My question to the other reviewers is - what did you do to make thicker for gravy - cornstarch or flour?

I've used this recipe four years in a row. I use it for gravy and to replce store bought broth in many dishes. This is way more flavourful.

Will never make turkey stock any other way again. The resulting gravy was about the best I've ever had. As the commentary said top-grade ingredients yield first class results.

Good,basic stock recipe. Definitely add whatever fresh herbs you have on hand - thyme, sage - whatever is left over from Thanksgiving. Makes a world of difference.

Made this stock for my turkey gravy and it was good, and easy. I always undersalt at the beginning because I often need to reduce homemade broth to concentrate the flavor. I will definitely make it again. Making gravy at the last minute is just too stressful for me!

I've been making stock ahead for Thanksgiving for several years. It really helps to make great gravy and relive some of the last minute stress of getting everything ready for the table. This is a good basic stock - it just always takes longer to get the turkey to a golden brown (about double for me)so plan accordingly.

Making this stock ahead and freezing changed my life...and improved the gravy.
