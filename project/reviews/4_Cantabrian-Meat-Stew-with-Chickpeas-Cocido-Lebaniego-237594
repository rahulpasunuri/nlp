For those who are actually interested in making the dish, there may be a question of substitution if all ingredients are not available. The logic of this dish is comparable to a more rustic, complicated pot-au-feu; hence the veal shank is lovely, but you could use marrow bones, or use fewer smoked items if necessary. Googling cocido will bring up other regional alternatives. This is a family festival dish, this recipe is lovely and it's fun to eat together. To save time, I just called my local Hispanic butcher and had him gather all the ingredients for me.

To the cook from SF, California. Why bother to review a recipe if you're going to make so many substitutions? I made this with no alterations and there were no leftovers!

It calls for seven different meats, the most interesting being a pig's ear, slice of snout or piece of foot...

This takes me back to a wonderful stay at the Hotel del Oso in the 80s.. making and eating this stew is almost like being there!

Eating this now. Substituted steamed rice for the chickpeas. Substitued fish for the meat. Skipped cooking instructions for the fish. Added a wasabi/soy sauce dip on the side. Recommended!

Just the kind of feedback the amateur cook needs when approaching a deceptively simple regional dish such as this one. Pleasantly surprised by the results: the family enjoyed it too!

I can see how a wonderful receipe like this would evolve from a hotel in a city and country like Cosgaya, Cantabria.

This is the most wonderful recipe. Every time I make it my husband takes me out to dinner.
