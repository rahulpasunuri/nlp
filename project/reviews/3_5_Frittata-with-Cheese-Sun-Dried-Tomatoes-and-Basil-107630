My first attempt at a frittata and it turned out fantastic! Very pleased. Omitted the olives ( not a fan) and used feta cheese instead. I also added a couple of red bell peppers as they were languishing in the fridge. Next time I'll up the sun dried tomatoes and basil.

We are very salt sensitive so I didn't add salt and I washed the olives and the sun-dried tomatoes. The result was well salted. I also added spinach that I'd sauteed in advance for extra nutrition.

Made this for a brunch for my church. Everyone loved it. Made it in large commercial pans and it turned out great. Fresh basil is a must. Will be making this a lot more.

Made this for a Father's Day brunch and it was very well recieved. Made some changes that others had suggested---didn't add the salt, rinsed the olives to also lessen the salt, added the olives into the mixture and because I had a lot going on I baked it in a 350 oven for about 45 minutes. Excellent. Have an extra piece for lunch today!

Yum. I had never made a frittata before but this was relatively easy. I left out the additional salt, which was a good choice, and added some chopped baby spinach, also a good choice.

A forgiving recipe you can mess with it and it is still yummy. I have used odd bits of cheese, a cup of half& half, much less butter--just coat the skillet,more olives, no salt. Used leeks once and that was tasty.

Rating: 4
Overall, very tasty. Definitely too salty. I used half the butter, no salt and cut back on the cheese this time to see if it helps. I also add fresh chopped cherry tomatoes and asparagus. Gets rave reviews from friends. Will definitely make again.

Yummy, quick, and easy, so I'll give four stars for that combination of attributes. I used less butter than the recipe called for (and would use even less next time), no added salt, and more basil and olives (which I put right into the egg mixture instead of on top as the recipe suggested). Oh, and I baked it at 400 degrees, as I do not trust myself with broilers. It was indeed a bit salty (even without the added salt). Maybe unsalted butter would help? I love feta and kalamatas so am willing to trade the saltiness for their yumminess.

I have made this twice now, and it was great! First time for breakfast for a house full of hungry guests, and everyone loved it, but the best thing was that there was minimal cleaning up compared to a full cooked breakfast! I have also halved the recipe and made it for supper for my husband and I - he adored it and it was soooo quick. Loved that I didn't have to go to the store to buy a single thing - had it all in the pantry.

This frittata is much more than the sum of its parts! I was really happy to discover that I could use pantry staples to make something so good, so quick. We enjoyed this as a weeknight supper, but it work just as well for an elegant brunch. A real find!

I made this for our New Year's day brunch. I followed other reviewer's advice and left out the salt. If you are using the sun-dried tomatoes, be sure to run them through a food-processor. If not chopped thoroughly, they become kind of chewy and they distract from the overall texture. Otherwise, the dish was very easy to make. I added it to my recipe box!

This has become a new staple - it can be breakfast, lunch or dinner, depending on the side. The leftovers are portable and delicious cold.

I agree with the other reviews, there is no need to add salt. I added bacon, but it was unnecessary  it just got lost in all the other flavours. Very tasty, I will make it again!

Made this Christmas morning two years in a row. It's so simple and delicious. Added more basil than the recipe called for for an even fresher taste. One note: I am a total salt fanatic, but adding the extra salt at the end to the already salty olive/feta/parmesan combo was a mistake I forgot to rectify BOTH times I made the recipe. :(

Very good. Great for a brunch. Don't add salt because of the salt in olives and butter.

I'm just starting to really getting a grasp at cooking. I've never made a frittata before and this recipe helped me make an awesome one today. Granted, I made A LOT of changes to this recipe to suit my needs, but the general idea of how to make a frittata (when to add eggs, using a broiler, etc.) was a great 1st time guide. I used 2 whole eggs and 3 egg whites for just me and my fiancee (we're trying to cut down on cholesterol). I used onions, green onions, green bell peppers, crimini mushrooms, shredded mozzarella cheese, salt & pepper, and half & half. It turned out great! I'm definitely making this again. Thanks again epicurious....always coming to the kitchen rescue.

Excellent! Made this for company with kids, so left out the Kalamata olives and traded fresh chopped tomato for sun-dried, and everyone LOVED it. My DH thought it was the best frittata he's ever tasted, and he's tasted a LOT!

Rating: 3
Very good and easy to make. A little too salty with the feta and olives. Next time will cut down on both. With all the fat, I would say this is a special occasion dish. However, I think you could easily replace the cream with low-fat milk and cut down on the butter and cheese for an everyday type meal, without sacrificing too much flavor.

Rating: 3
I got rave reviews from my brunch crowd for this frittata. I didn't have any butter, so just used some cooking spray and it was still awesome. Also, I was really rushing around and didn't trust that I'd watch the broiler carefully, so I baked it for about 15m at 350 instead. It was great!

Rating: 3
This was good, considering that I don't like eggs. I have always wanted to make a frittata, and decided to try this recipe. It was very easy, and worked well. Except, I found that I had to broil the frittata longer--the center still wasn't cooked completely. The outside edges were heavenly.

Excellent! got rave reviews from family visiting for Thanksgiving. I thought it would be a risk to make with the feta, olives, etc. but all flavors blended wonderfully and the presentation was picture perfect.

Served this at Easter brunch. Everyone loved it. I added diced bell peppers to give it even more color. Very light and fluffy. Easy but impressive.

I used this recipe, but left a few things out as did other reviewers and it was delicious! Made it for family who had never had anything like it and are not adventurous eaters and they all loved it! I included the basil, and sundried tomatoes but added ham and it was a great combination. I didn't have a large non-stick so I used a regular large skillet and it stuck a bit on the bottom so I just served it right from the pan. It was extremely flavorful and I can't wait to make it again!

Delicious! Had it for an easy supper last night...loved the combination of ingredients. Used a pretty large non-stick (either 12 or 14-inch I'm not sure), but it turned out fine.

Never made a frittata before this one, and this is a winner! I've made it for three brunches in the last few months and it always gets raves. Fantastic flavor and easy base to experiment with ingredients. Just recently did one with goat cheese and bell peppers. I use a 12 inch pan and sometimes even a larger one. Timing is everything with this dish...

This was absolutely delicious. It was fast and easy, too. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making it. The olives didn't overpower the dish, they added to all the flavors. I brought it to a brunch gathering and it was a huge hit!

Rating: 3
Excellent, flavourful, easy. Impressive on the table. Other reviewers said this tasted better the second day, so I made this dish the night before (assembled and cooked) and then popped it in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes before serving. P.S. 1/8th of the frittata has 327 cal., I calculated.

I didn't have green onions, so I chopped up a shallot. I did use the olives, and I only had dried basil, so I used that, but added 1/3 cup chiffonade of fresh spinach that I had on hand. My husband generally gripes when I serve meatless dinners, but he kept moaning and rolling his eyes when he bit into this, so I'm assuming he liked it. I added a clove of garlic, too....couldn't resist.

How come everyone left out the olives? I mixed part of them into the egg mixture and sprinkled the rest on top. Delicious! My guests loved it. Six of us ate the whole frittata. (We were very thristy afterwards!)I used half olive oil and half butter, and next time would use a total of only two tablespoons.

I was recently served this frittata at a bed and breakfast. Couldn't wait to come home and make it myself.

I served this for a brunch with ten other women. It was a perfect addition. Nearly everyone asked for the recipe. I, too, left out the olives. I couldn't find oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, so I just used a small 10 oz. package of sun-dried tomatoes and it worked perfectly. It was easy enough for a beginning cook like me to make.

Very good. I used regular tomatoes and goat's cheese feta. I also added a dash of tabasco and left out the olives (as almost everyone seems to do). A wonderful breakfast!

I made this dish for a small get-together and it was a huge hit. Even one friend who doesn't like egg dishes much said it was delicious. Several people asked me for the recipe. I agree it was a little heavy and will try it with less butter and 2% milk next time.

Made two frittatas out of 10 eggs so it cooked all the way through but didn't get to dark on the outsides. It was hard to even out the ingredients given the directions said not to stir the mixture once it was in the pan. Next time I will pour the egg/cream into pan and then more evenly sprinkle on the mixed dry ingredients. I used non-oil packed sundried tomatoes and extra feta. Will serve olives on the side.

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe. I, too, replaced the cream with milk, and instead of feta tried shredded mozzarella. And I left out the olives but added crumbled bacon. Also, you really don't need all that butter. So I made a few modifications, but the result was excellent. It's going into permanent rotation.

Rating: 4
What a tasty frittata. I made some adjustments, I used cheddar and montery cheeses instead of feta and 2% milk instead of the cream. and it still tasted really good. I did overcook it slightly so it would have tasted even better but I'll know that for next time. I would definetly recommend this recipe.

The guests at our B&B raved about this recipe! I am especially happy, because I consider this an excellent "do-ahead" dish, as it tastes just as nice if you make it the night before serving. While I like olives, I use them as a colorful garnish with carrots over lettuce to make sure all the guests are pleased.

Very tasty, but the kalamata olives were a bit overpowering. To cut back on the fat I used egg substitute, reduced-fat feta, 2% milk and sundried tomatoes that were not oil packed. I used a nonstick pan coated with cooking spray and only used 1 tablespoon of butter.

The first day I made this, I was disappointed. It tasted very flat and dull. However, the second day (and third) it was delicious reheated or cold. Made this with dried basil b/c I ran out of fresh - don't know if that made a difference or not. Will definitely make again - ahead of time.

I haven't tried this recipe, but for the cook who wanted low-fat alternatives, here are some suggestions: reduced-fat feta, evaporated skim milk in place of cream, egg substitute for part of the eggs (I would do half substitute and half eggs). You could reduce the olives, use lower fat margarine instead of butter, or just reduce the butter by a tbsp or two. I wouldn't change the parmesan. You have lots of options; just use your personal preferences! Good luck.

Bachelor. Never make a 10 egg frittata with fresh basil if you aren't going to devour the whole thing in one day (use dried instead): the basil starts to taste really off within about 18 to 24 hours in the fridge. One reason I love making frittatas is because I can breakfast or snack on it for 3 or 4 days.

Rating: 2
I agree with the cook that the oil was a little heavy. I wouldn't add the sun-dried tomatoes until the eggs set up a bit as they became very dense on the bottom when added according to the recipe. Much easier to just scramble the eggs with all the ingredients; still get the taste without the trouble.

The other reviewer suggested using low-fat milk instead of cream. I make this sort of thing every weekend, with whatever cheeses, etc. on hand, and it's always delicious. I never add cream or milk to the eggs, nor do I use that much butter in the pan -- a non-stick pan with a spray of olive oil or Pam will work just fine.

Question: there was a reference to a lower fat version of this recipe but I didn't see the alternatives listed in the recipe or reviews. Could someone please respond with the substitutions? Don't get me wrong, the original recipe sounds sinfully delish but a lower fat alternative would be handy to have on hand as well. thanks!!

This was delicious. However I made a few changes to it to accommodate the lactose intolerant. I replaced the feta with buffalo mozzarella and cream with lactaid milk. By mistake I cooked the olives in the frittata, and will continue to make it this way. This is definitely one recipe to keep on file.

Quick & easy recipe (although chopping takes a while if you don't have a food processor). very tasty! Will have to try the lower-fat suggestion as that is the high fat content is my only qualm with the recipe.

Works just as well with lower fat ingredients such as 1 or 2% milk in place of cream. Nice simple supper. You can also use any other combination of flavoring ingredients to get rid of leftovers such as cooked vegetables, chicken or whatever.
