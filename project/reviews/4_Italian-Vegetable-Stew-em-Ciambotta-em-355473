We thought this was a great recipe, and were completely aware that a VEGETABLE stew would involve CHOPPING vegetables!! Not labour intensive, a pleasant activity that resulted in a wonderful, tasty meal. We added basil and chili flakes, and enjoyed it with good romano cheese on top. A keeper!

the trick is to add salt and pepper and oregano. also my mom taught me to make this soup and we just cut all the veggies and tossed them in a big pot and let cook for a few hours on low. hassle free! also there should be more tomatoey liquid. eat with rock hard italian bread :-D i dont understand the precooking..the potatoes should be big so that they dont break up after cooking long.

Great recipe! I however didn't use the eggplant and potatoes and I didn't cook the green beans in a seperate pot. I added the green beans and let them simmer with the rest of the stew. I also added a can of drained white beans near the end as well as a dash of dried basil. My family loved it.

I was surprised at how good this was. Simple ingredients that came together very well. did not have green beans, but I did have brussel sprouts and they worked just fine. I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

Thanks for the advice from the other reviewers I had prepared my veggies prior to cooking. My daughter is a vegetarian so I am always looking for new interesting recipes. This recipe helped me used up some vegetables that I had going spare in the fridge. I added large field mushrooms chopped in big pieces. I also added 2 - 3 T of Provence herbs and 2 bay leaves, a splash of balsamic vinegar, as I felt the recipe required a bit more flavour. I served it with a mixture of brown and wild rice. The recipe it self, is nothing special. But it is a good way to use up excess vegetables. The general premise of the recipe I will probably use again incorporating my changes.

Lots of prep work with this one. READ THIS RECIPE CAREFULLY. What helped me is that I have a habit of preparing all my veggies in advance, you will need to do that here if you aren't a fast chopper like me. Also cut the potatoes smaller than they recommend, or boil them longer. I added by veggies two minutes early than the recipe wanted because the veggies were really wilted. I covered the pan, put it on extremely low and let it simmer for another 7 minutes and it was GREAT! A simple soup with all these nice flavors!

I made this three times, trying to make it better each time adding variations to what we found to be a rather bland, unexciting veggie soup. Finally I gave up. Discovered the Escarole, White bean and Garlic soup (also on Epi) and I cannot make it often enough! The latter is easier and orders of magnitude better.

I love this recipe. It's so fresh and delicious, I've never had or made a stew quite like it. I top with shaved parmesan and it adds a little extra flavor.

Rating: 4
This recipe is a staple in my recipe box! Its delicious and doesn't need any additional seasonings outside of salt and pepper because the natural flavor of all the vegetables blend together perfectly. My non-vegetarian friends love its taste. Cooking tips: Have all vegetables chopped before you begin cooking to eliminate missing a step or overcooking certain portions of the recipe. I add an extra clove of garlic and let the final dish simmer for 30 minutes on LOW when completed. Serve with brown rice or fresh rolls.

Outstanding. I made this for our vegetarian guests on Christmas (served over a slice of toasted ciabatta) and they swooned. I've now made a pot just for myself. Wonderful that it can be made ahead. For WeightWatchers, it is only 2 PointsPLUS per cup.

Per a few reviewers, I added red pepper flakes. I also only used a couple tablespoons of oil. Delicious meal, but I had to halve the recipe...This recipe makes enough food for an army! At 6-8 servings, these portions are huge. It's a whole meal by itself. As an appetizer-sized soup, it would make twice this many servings.

Rating: 4
this was very good, however I added too much salt. I'd suggest rinsing the boiled veggies to remove the excess salt. I also noticed after it was too late the recipe calls for cooking after the tomatoes are added for 15 minutes before adding the veggies. However, it takes 20 minutes to cook the beans, potatoes, and zucchini. So you may want to start them earlier.

The only portion I did in the pan for this recipe was browning the onions. Everything else went into a crock pot for four hours. I subbed 1/2 cup of water for two to three cups of vegetable broth and doubled the garlic. Turned out so well sans carrots, I think I had the wrong type of carrots. It's important to cut the potatoes in s smaller cube so they get cooked through.

Rating: 4
I absolutely loved this stew. I didn't have zucchini, so I used cubed butternut squash. I avoided the overcooked vegetables by adding the green beans, potatoes and squash about 5 minutes before it was done. The vegetables were not mushy and they added texture to the stew. We had it over garlic pearled couscous. Delicious.

I love this recipe! It's a great dose of veggies for the week, which is good since it is quite a bit of prep work. I usually add enough stock &/or veggie cooking liquid to thin it a bit, probably 1-2 cups, depending on consistency. I also add a little extra salt, 1/4 t. cayenne (or red pepper flakes), and 2-3 T Italian herbs, or a blend of oregano, marjoram, basil, rosemary and thyme. If I've got a parmi rind it's in there too. Good stuff!

We loved this recipe! It's all vegetables and very filling. I picked potatoes, zucchinis, beans, tomatoes and eggplants from our garden right before cooking and it was simply amazing! Not bland at all! I am not certain that store-bought produce would have the same results in this dish. The dish sent my mother and I down a memory lane because it tastes just like Russian vegetable ragout from years ago when we lived there. The only bad thing is - that it cooks down a lot volume -wise. Other than that, absolutely loved it!

We replaced the eggplant with beef bourguignon, added the chili flakes that people recommended, doubled up on the pepper, and also added a bit of Montreal Steak Spice. Came out really well!

I do love eggplant, but I don't think it works in this dish. I understand is a stew, and not a soup, but still way too thick for my taste. The vegetables end up being overcooked and it looks messy (I agree with other reviewers). I will not make it again.

Rating: 3
Very, very good. a 3.5 really. I made something like this by happenstance a few months ago, only i roasted all the ingredients in the oven, for a veggie bake. I never got the same taste again until this. I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes on hand, nor a can of tomatoes, but i did have tomato paste. I mixed that with water. I highly suggest Gomasio, I think it is Japanese. I am not sure if that is the French name, but basically it is a ground sesame seed and salt combo. Sprinkle it on just before serving.

Pretty good but rather boring, even when using fire-roasted tomatoes and adding pepper flakes. My husband ate the green beans and potatoes but pushed the rest around his plate.

This recipe was awful! It was extremely bland, and the vegetables were overcooked. My roommate and I couldn't even finish our portions, and we threw out all of the leftovers. I halved the recipe, but ended up with way more than 3-4 servings.

Good, hearty, veggie meal, especially on a cold night like tonight. Next time going to follow some other reviewers and add red-pepper flakes to get a little "heat." I bet the leftovers will be delicious.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! There's a lot to chop but it's definitely worth it in the end! I usually substitute potatoes for sweet potatoes (because we can't get enough sweet potatoes in our house!) or yams and it works great (they cook a bit faster then regular potatoes though so boil them for slightly less then 10 minutes). This is also delicious with a dollop of plain yogurt (or sour cream) and a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Also, the leftovers are great spooned onto some toasted crusty Italian bread or focaccia!

My husband and I both found this stew absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe pretty closely and added a handful of fresh Italian parsley, some sea salt and freshly ground 5 peppercorn mix for a little zing. It was labor intensive chopping all the vegies, but worth it. Served it over brown rice. yum

I ended up doing all the chopping by hand, and it definitely took longer than I expected... but it went over really well :) I made it not-so-vegetarian this time, since we had some left over turkey from Thanksgiving that I cut up into it. I don't know what those people were talking about, when they said it was bland... perhaps they don't appreciate the appeal of unadulterated fresh veggies. Aside from the turkey, I pretty much followed the recipe word for word, and it was really, really tasty. I also recommended to my mom that she share it with her vegetarian friend :)

This was a delicious and simple stew, although I agree with only salt & pepper and garlic, it needs something else. A sprinkling of cheese and some basil pesto was good. I will try red pepper flakes next time. I would rather eat a huge bowl or two of this to get my veggies than a salad, though, anyday.

My family loved this recipe! It's a little time consuming to do all the chopping, but well worth it! I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water and spiced it up with hot pepper flakes. I also used a can of Rotel instead of the tomatoes. It was so flavorful!

This is a bit labor-intensive. As I chopped vegetables, I thought -- this better be really good! And it was -- it's going into my vegetarian-meal rotation. I followed the recipe exactly; next time I will add red pepper flakes and some mushrooms, and serve it over polenta. Thanks to all for the reviews, as I probably wouldn't have tried it otherwise.

Delicious. Something like a ratatouille with more vegetables. Great with some grated parmesan on top. Herbs and red pepper flakes also improved it.

Made this about one month ago and froze some of the leftovers which were defrosted this week. I was a little afraid that it would have turned to mush, but it was still just as good as it was before. The potatoes had broken down a bit, but in a way that I did not dislike. For the reviewers who label it as bland...I just don't understand. Was it that I substituted chicken broth, fire roasted diced tomatoes and sea salt for water, canned whole tomatoes and table salt? This recipe was delicious and I will be making it over and over again for pure comfort food as it gets crazy cold this winter.

I'm a vegetarian so I was really excited by this recipe and all the great reviews. I found it pretty bland overall. It is seasoned with only salt and pepper and it really is missing something. I used canned tomatoes, so it had a little of that "canned tomato" taste. I would prefer a traditional ratatouille over this any day. If you do decide to make it, use fresh tomatoes and add extra garlic for flavor. I also added basil, which didn't do mych for the flavor.

I was really happy with this recipe. I didn't expect it to be as hearty, filling or as flavorful as it is, considering that it's all vegetables, with minimal seasoning. I did add two extra cloves of garlic and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes at the beginning, but aside from that I followed the recipe exactly.

This stew is really good considering it is all vegetables. I was shocked when I read the recipe and found out that it didn't call for any italian seasoning....just vegetables and water. I substituted the water for broth and that turned out nicely. I also accidentally added 2 cups of broth instead of the 1/2 cup of water. That turned out ok too because you're supposed to add the drained juice from the canned tomatoes. I did not add the tomato juice and it still tastes good. It is also very good the next day.

This recipe's biggest selling point is its healthiness, without sacrificing flavor. The prep work is made a lot easier w/ the slicing blade of a food processor. I served it over couscous and with a creamy chardonnay -- great early autumn supper.

I don't know why this is so yummy--it seems like it would be quite bland--but it is really tasty. I used some pattypan squash instead of eggplant, but otherwise exactly followed the recipe--water, no stock, no extra seasonings. I would have given it 3 forks, but for something so healthy, it is remarkably good, so it gets 4 forks from me.

Oh my this was delicious the first day but even better the second day. We made a lasagna with the second half, layering with a bechamel with parmesan cheese. It was even better that way. This is in my permant file.

This was so delicious, and healthy! I made it almost as is (I know, why review a recipe that is changed, but it will still be good as is) I just added red pepper flakes at the beginning for a little heat, and substituted chickpeas for the green beans because I don't like green beans. Also, with the addition of the chickpeas, it can be a main dish now. Yum!

MMmm delicious and savory! I love the broth that's created- I added a 1/3 - 1/2 cup of Merlot red wine for extra taste. I like how this recipe can be personalized depending on what's in the fridge. I didn't have eggplant or potatoes so I put in extra carrots and zucchini. Will definitely make again!

I always like to make a recipe as written the first time, which I did, and the stew was marvelous. I guess it might be better with basil and bay leaf and such, but I'd hate to ruin a batch to find out! Just as good as leftovers, and since there are just 2 of us there were tons of leftovers. Can't wait to share this with all the healthy eaters in my family.

It was a rainy, fall day so I wanted something hot, low fat and low cal. I used one potatoe and this was perfect. The combination of vegetables is unique. Potatoes with zucchini and eggplant? Who knew? I like spicey food also, so I used stewed tomatoes with oregano in the can.1 bay leaf, extra clove of garlic, a pinch of thyme, a pinch of red pepper flakes. Not much. I had some parmesian cheese, tobasco, and fat free sour cream in the frig, so I tried all three seperately to see what topping was best. One dollop of sour cream won. I admit it, I tweek recipes to be spicey! Spice up your life! Next time I might try curry...just kidding..

Wonderful dinner on a crip evening. Stayed pretty true to the recipe except sauteed onions for about five minutes to mellow the flavor so it would not be taken on by the carrots/celery. Used a can of Muir Glen fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of whole and used chicken stock instead of water. Did not peel the potatoes, but that was not a planned change to the recipe - just forgot to do it before dicing. Amazing flavor with only sea salt and pepper and garlic. In my opinion, no need for additional herbs. I will definitely make this stew again.

Thank you for this recipe from my childhood. This was a summer staple growing up. I recently looked for a recipe but had no idea how to spell ciambotta which in my family was always called something that sounded like "chumbot". I will make this soon in memory of the two best cooks I ever knew, my mother and my grandmother, and think of wonderful big family dinners at my grandparents country house in the Catskills where this stew was made with veggies from my grandfather's garden.

My book club had a steaming pot of this beautiful ciambotta for lunch outdoors on a cool, golden fall day at a mountain cabin. The stew was delicious and filling. 6 of us finished every bite. A baguette with butter completed the meal.

Amazingly delicious for something so simple (and seasoned only with garlic, salt and peppper!). I had all these ingredients on hand so made it almost exactly as written; the eggplant, I would say, is a must, as it lent the dish a surprising and very pleasing sweetness. Do watch the cooking times on the boiled vegetables, as it's nice for them not to turn to mush when you stir them into the simmering base.

This is amazing stew! So flavorful. I added some of the boiled potato water during the last step. I like it a little thinner. I garnished the stew with a bit of parsley, too.
