Very easy to make, a tasty light dessert.

I've made this twice and have been very happy each time. It is extremely simple and tasty. An easy and elegant finish to a nice dinner for two, even if the dinner is just crusty bread and imported cheeses. Poaching time will vary depending on the ripeness of the pear. The second time I made it with dried cherries instead of apricots and that was wonderful (especially with the chocolate sauce) too. Start to finish this recipe takes only 15 minutes.
