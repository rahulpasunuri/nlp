I was plesantly surprised that all was cooked very nicely in the 12 minutes as stated. Cutting the vegetables took the most time. While my husband has a thing against boneless skinless chicken breasts, he had to admit this was a tasty recipe. To the cook who thought the odor was off-putting, perhaps you don't like olives. We love them, so it smelled wonderful to us. Thought this would be great for a summer concert picnic dish. Well balanced, all in the same packet of foil.

This is great...maybe those who didn't like it have not cooked many more unusual and "chef-oriented" recipes...it was great and easy and memorable.....

I did NOT like this at all! Food does cook quickly, 12 minutes, not long enough for flavor to develop. Chicken was bland. Olives & veggies just tasted steamed, no flavor. I won't be making this again.

This is unbelievably easy to make on the grill. I used chopped cucumber pieces and vidalis onion because thats what I had on hand and skipped the artichoke hearts and it was great!!!

I don't use a grill...any ideas for oven time and temp to try this recipe?

I hate to be a party pooper, but it's probably not a good idea to have food come in contact with aluminum and acids. The vinegar in the artichoke hearts and the acidity in the wine will surely leach out harmful properties in the aluminum foil during cooking. It's been established that having your food come in direct contact with aluminum pots, pans or foil is simply not safe!

@ A Cook 6.29.11 --- I think that without the support of the grill, you would need to use more layers of bigger pieces of foil, and still might lose your liquids, and also you'll have some danger of charring. But with care....? Try it and say back!

What do you guys think about taking this camping and throwing the foil packets in the fire?

AMAZING! I wish it looked a little prettier. The tapenade is not very attractive, but OHHHH it is sooooo yummy! Next time, I'm using all sweet potatoes. They were my favorite.

We made this recipe exactly as written and really enjoyed it. The chicken was very tender and flavorful. Next time we will probably take out the regular potatoes and just use 2 lbs of sweet potatoes. We also may take out the zucchini and use another vegetable (tomatoes perhaps). There was nothing wrong with the regular potatoes and the zucchini, they just didn't seem particularly flavorful. There is some prep time involved in cutting the vegetables and making the tapenade, but assembly is easy and the end result was worth the effort. We used a gas grill set on medium-high flame and the pouches cooked in 12 minutes as stated in the recipe.

This dish was easy to make, and a great excuse to use the grill. The final product was fragrant, juicy, healthy, and super tasty! I followed the recipe to the letter, and the *only* thing I'm going to do differently next time is to be a bit more liberal with the salt. Other than that, the sweet potatoes were a nice flavor and color contrast to the other veggies, and the chicken was tender and very flavorful. Yum! I've added this recipe to my favorites and am excited to try variations with local summer veggies from my neighborhood farmer's market.
