Delicious. I used it cut into strips over a Caesar salad. My 10-year-old devoured it.

This is a good, basic, everyday recipe for flank steak.

This is an amazing marinade! Only marinated it for about an hour and a half tonight and it was still delicious. Definately my go to recipe for flank steak. Highly recommend!

Just made this and it was fantastic. Agree with another reviewer about reducing the salt however.

My family LOVED this flank steak! I marinated it for about 24 hours, cooked it on the grill, and the flavor was amazing! I also made one for a friend, and her family raved about the recipe as well! YUM.

I love grilled flank steak - just make sure to cut it against the grain after cooking for a more tender cut. I'd also suggest basting with pesto, I did that here http://tiny.cc/iujz0 and it was awesome.

This was surprisingly flavorful and juicy after just a 2-hour marinade. Next time I might add some chili flakes, but my guests loved this as-is. I cooked mine in a grill pan on the stove as I have no grill. It took about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare to medium beef. The leftovers are great, too.

Huge hit with the whole family. We only eat grass-fed beef, and I used this recipe with the sole portion of flank steak we'd gotten in our last order. My husband remarked that he regretted not ordering more, thinking it was not a flavorful cut of beef. Not any more it's not. :)

Nothing special....this is quite overrated.

I tried this recipe because I had all of the ingrediants for the marinade (used dried rosemary, not fresh). I was very happy with how it turned out. Served with parmesian couscous and salad. My son put the meat in a soft tortilla. His version of a fajita. Easy, fast, good.

This was really good -- better than many recipes which call for many more ingredients. To the cook who asked abour dried versus fresh herbs: generally, you use 1/3 the amount of dried, but I would use only fresh rosemary in this particular dish.

This dish was wonderful. I marinated it for 24 hours, and grilled it on a gas grill at high heat for 6 minutes on a side, which resulted in medium rare beef. I would recommend a slight reduction in the salt, perhaps 1 to 1 1/4 teaspoons. I know this will be a regularly made dish, as the cold sandwiches from the remaining meat are delicious.

I will be making this (again!) for Mother's Day. A perennial favorite and super easy. I too marinate for 24 hours, and the grilling instructions are perfect - comes out just right every time.

This was wonderful. I'll make this often. I used red wine vinegar instead of the white and was very happy with it.

Couldn't imagine how a cut of beef from that area of a cow could be so tender and tasty.Absolutely delicious.

A great hit with the crowd! Even the grandkids, who are fussy eaters, loved it.

This was delicious. I marinated it for 24 hours, and the flavors were great. We had just enough leftovers the next day for sandwiches, and they were just as good as the first time around.

Made as ordered, changed nothing except marinated for 24 hours. Went well with the horseradish mashed potatos. Will definitely make again.

very good flavor that defintely permeated the meat - I marinated all day. served with mashed yukon gold potatoes. will absolutely be repeating this one. simple, easy and tasty.

I've made this twice with london broil and never had leftovers to pack up. (Though I wish I did, I'm sure the meat would make a great sandwich the next day.) I would recommend marinating at least eight hours.

I make this all the time, using skirt steak instead of flank steak, and red wine vinegar usually. You can be loose with the proportions and still get a tasty steak.

Excellent! Usually do an asian marinade so this was something different. To the reader who didn't know how to subsitute dried for frest herbs - the ratio is 1part dried to 3 parts fresh.

You use less dried herbs than fresh herbs. I don't know exactly how much less, though.

Rating: 0
I haven't made this yet, but I'd like to. I have a question first that I'm sure will be easy to answer from most of the cooks who use this website. As a general rule, if you don't have the fresh herb and want to substitute with dried, do you use more or less than the recipe calls for?

Simple and delicious. Great for a weeknight meal. I thought the vinegar could be cut back a tiny bit--my husband said don't change a thing. I'll make it again.

I cut this recipe in 1/2 and it worked fine. Also, it was too cold out to grill, so I broiled the steak in the oven. Didn't brown as nicely, but it tasted great. Easy to make and hard to beat the taste.

Rating: 3
This is a great and easy recipe. I made it following the recipe first, then tried it again substituting the rosemary with cilantro. When I use cilantro I use more like 1/3 a cup of fresh chopped cilantro, but that depends on how much you like cilantro.

A great company dish..so easy to make. Everyone I"ve served it to raves how good it is and wants the recipe

definitely give the steak time to marinate, you will be pleased....delicious!

I used London Broil for this and the steaks tasted delicious. I also made the cherry tomato and olive topping from the June 2002 bon Appetit which tasted fantastic on top of the steak.

I added some diced red onion - grilled medium rare excellant

If made per instructions- this is a fabulous dish. the steak has great flavor. PLEASE let it marinate for at least 8 hours- flank steak is a great cut as long as you let it have enough time in its marinade.

I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I substituted Rice Wine Vinegar. This dish was ok. It's easily prepared, so I would make it again, but overall I didn't think it was anything special.

My family loved this dish, and it was so easy to make! Thanks for adding another family favorite to my list.

Similar to a recipe I have been making for years with the following changes: beef loves red wine, so substitute part red wine vinegar/part decent cabernet for the white wine vinegar; cut WAY back on the olive oil and add a little dijon mustard. Makes a wonderful marinade for flank or sirloin steak, try it.

This was really easy and really delicious. Would like to be able to make in smaller quantities as to not waste ingredients when making smaller portion. Taste was SO GOOD!

This was incredible I have made it more than once. Try some cracked red pepper and oregano this give it a south western taste. I grilled it on Oak wood (red-eye oak) then sliced it thin for Southwestern Burritos with Avacado and sour cream. It was incredible try it.
