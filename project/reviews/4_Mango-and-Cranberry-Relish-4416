I thought the orange flavor overpowered the mango to the point that you couldn't taste the mango. Try using 1/4 of an orange instead of 1/2.

When we made this again, we realized that last year we forgot the orange. This year, when we made it with the orange, you couldn't taste the mango. We threw it out, spent another $14 for 1 pound of frozen cranberries and made it with just the mango, sugar and cranberries. Super easy and unbelievably yummy.

We have a large Thanksgiving Dinner for Americans living in Sydney. As it is mango season in November, we tried this recipe. This year, when we sent out the invitation, two people said that we better be making the mango cranberry relish again or they woundn't come. This is outstanding and so easy to make.

A delicious refreshing change to the traditional cranberry sauce. I used the suggested half lemon and it tasted great. Will join my other regular condiments in the refrigerator.

I have been making this recipe each year since it first appeared in the Thanksgiving issue of Bon Appetit in 97'. It's simply delicious.

I made this cranberry relish for Thanksgiving dinner at my home in 1997, the first time my family ever strayed from canned cranberries. Needless to say, they loved it and I have been asked to make it every year since! It's best when made at least one day ahead. I've also added 1/2 lemon to cut some of the sweetness.

Very fruity and tasty! Really easy to make. Excellent with smoked turkey.
