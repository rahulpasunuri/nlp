This has been my go-to roast pork recipe since it was printed in 2006. It has never been dry and always flavorful. I especially like the sandwich with sharp provolone.

Not sure why mine wasn't as good as others' reviews say, but I will not be making this recipe again.

Wonderful recipe! The pork was very moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again and serve it for company next time.

This is an easy to make meal that requires a little bit of prep and a long cook time (hence the "slow-roast" in the name). I've read some of the other reviews, and I just want to add - use a meat thermometer (make certain that it does not touch the bone) as well as a separate thermometer to measure the inside oven temperature since ovens always run hotter or colder and have hot spots. One other tip - remember that meat continues to cook after you remove it from the oven. If you remove it when the meat thermometer says 155 - 160 degrees, tent it with foil, and let it rest for about an hour (with the thermometer still in) you won't have a dried out piece of meat. This is definitely a favorite, I have made it several times and it has always been a hit.

I have made this several times with great success so surprised that others did not like it. Maybe try wrapping in foil while cooking and serving with meat in juicy sauce. It is great with sharp provolone or fresb mozzarella on crusty club rolls. Looking forward to super bowl 2009 with this recipe as the headliner. Of course will do the prep ahead of time as it does take a while but worth it.

I actually tossed the leftovers in the garbage.

Made this for game day. Too much work and not all that much flavor. Froze it and added BBQ sauce later.

My husband made this and the pork was very good. The left overs were even better. We froze some of the meat and he made pork carnitas taco's with it. WOW. Now this was great. Almost as good as the ones at Super Tacoria in San Jose, CA, which has the BEST taco's anywhere. I couldn't eat enough of them.

in light of the other reviews- maybe i did something wrong. i followed the recipe and we hated this. maybe we hate fennel- but we called this "that earwax flavored pork". needless to say, we will not make this again.

This was a real crowd pleaser. Very easy to make and allowed me time to enjoy the game too!

I like to rub the dry ingredients, sear on a non-stick and throw it in a crock pot with the adition of a bit of white wine.

I thought this was a great easy meal. I cut the recipe in half, and did a smaller roast. Great flavor. The fresh mozzarella with peppers and onions put a first class finish on this sandwich.

I cut the cooking time down to 4 hours and still thought it was far too much. The pork was very dry.

This is really good even though it takes quite a while to make. I don;t like rosemary so I cut the amount but it was still too much for my taste.
