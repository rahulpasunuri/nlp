A disappointing use of a surprise find of beautiful blackberries in February. More like a pie than a cobbler, tho with a very dense crust. A lighter flakier one would have better suited this dish. Also way too sweet; the sugar overpowered the berries. If I make again I'll use another pastry dough recipe and halve the sugar. Maybe add lemon juice and eliminate the butter slivers on top (which were totally unnecessary).Actually maybe I'll just make a pie!
