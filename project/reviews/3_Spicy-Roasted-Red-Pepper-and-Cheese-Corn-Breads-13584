Very good. Baking time with a gas stove was only 35 minutes.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have tried many cornbread recipes over the years..this is a keeper. I do not add in any peppers (roasted or hot)This is a dense,very moist, satisfying bread. I serve it with a bowl of my homemade chili. OLE'

I was disappointed with this recipe. The ingredients sound wonderful but the texture and consistency of the bread is not right. It seemed too dense and heavy. Still looking for a light and fluffy flavorful corn bread....

Awesome dish and very easy. Didn't dust the pan with flour and must say that is a must. Will make it again.

I made this corn bread last night for a dinner party, and everyone raved about it! It's EXCELLENT. I used jalepenos slices (from a jar) and thought the amount of spice was just right. I'm anxious to make this again!

Very good, but very spicy. I'd use fewer jalapenos, or pepper jack cheese instead or Monterey.
