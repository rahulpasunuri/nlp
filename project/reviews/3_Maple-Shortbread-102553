I got maple sugar at Whole Foods. You can also buy it on Ebay at this time, not sure if they have it all year.

what is maple sugar? If it's not readily available, what can I substitute? Would love to try this cookie for Christmas!!

I lived in Vermont when I was a child and will never forget the flavor of pure maple. This is a thin crisp buttery maple cookie... perfect to serve with a fruit salad. I am making a simple grilled pineapple dessert tonight and this will go perfectly. This recipe took a little online ingenuity, morsefarm.com has the granulated maple sugar or you can call Butternut Mountain Farm at 800-828-2376 as they are the ones who make it. It is worth it!

Sounds good, but I think you have the wrong photo!
