Made this last night for guests and it was a smash hit. I couldn't find Arctic Char so I went with salmon. The cucumber relish was absolutely delightful and went beautifully with the fish. Can imagine that relish having many uses. The hush puppies were the best I've ever had. Made as written, wouldn't change a thing. Yummy meal! And as for the spelling&.Arctic is correct. I looked it up. :-)

We made this last night. Not overly impressed. The fish just seemed to be on top of the relish and there was a disconnect with the flavors. We tried to get the hush puppies to join in, kind of a Mediterranean Southern language barrier in my opinion. In the end we agreed we'd crust the fish (pine nuts), add Kalamatas to the relish, double the jalapeno in the puppies, do a 50/50 flour/meal blend but definitely keep the goat cheese, and find a sauce to marry the whole thing (I made a cilantro red pepper aoli for the puppies that perked them up a bit) together. In all I loved the flavor of the relish (would bring in mint and oregano vs. parsley) and the lightness of the fish with it. The hush puppies seemed out of place but I think you could really work with the fillings to make it a better partner for the mediterranean flavors in the fish portion.

Cool recipe. Too bad you misspelled "arCtic".

Loved it! No artic char was available, so we served with salmon instead. The hot fish semi-melted the feta and all the flavors just tasted wonderful together. Very mediterranean. And the presentation is beautiful. I'll definitely make it again -- next time will try the artic char.

Really enjoyed this! We had some leftover baby spinach in the kitchen which added more color to the plate. Relish is very good and the hush puppies were a fun addition to the plate! I will make it again.

I made this primarily for the relish; it's great. However, I used my favorite fish (Pacific Salmon steaks). I also served the relish with broiled lamb chops; DELISH!

Quick fancy meal. The hush puppies felt out of place so next time I would serve with couscous instead (although the hush puppies were good). Be sure to char the fish a bit longer than recommended.
