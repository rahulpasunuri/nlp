I made this for a party, but it looked so unappetizing I ended up going to the supermarket for a substitute. However, it tasted good so I ate it at home. Next time I won't keep any of the skin on, and I won't slice and roast the pieces. I will roast the eggplant whole (after slicing down the sides so it won't explode), and then just cut it open and scoop it out. That way you'll use much less olive oil, and the horrible brownish color won't be likely to happen. I really liked the fresh mint and basil.

We tried this recipe tonight and loved it! Of course, we only used the recipe as a guide but loved the idea of using the farm-fresh japanese eggplants with the fresh-picked purple basil that we just picked up from the local farmer's market. The eggplant added a smooth consistency and the purple basil - color. We served the pesto with bowtie pasta and slices of sweet, organic yellow tomato drizzled with olive oil, parsley and garlic. To make the pesto less dry and crumbly we added about 1/4 cup of good olive oil and topped the pesto with grated parmesan. The results were fantastic.

Was a very healthy change though I didn't really like the flavour. My family thought it was great though. Perhaps as others have suggested, the goat cheese would have been a nice touch.

I would probably make this again because it's so nice to have an alternative healthful appetizer, but I had two problems with this dish. First, the concept of "crostinis" is overrated, I think. The bread is often too hard and a rather clumsy size for biting. Second, the spread was pretty bland-I liked the mint; luckily I took another reviewer's advice and had herbed goat cheese on hand.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit. It can be frozen, too. If you put just a bit of goat cheese on the crostini first, then the spread, it makes for a VERY TASTY appetizer.

Pretty simple to make and my guests really enjoyed it.

I have an abundance of eggplant and basil in my garden right now, so this recipe helped make use of both. A great change from the basic pesto or caponata. Added just a splash of balsamic vinegar. Substituted walnuts for the pine nuts. Looking forward to making this again and perhaps trying to freeze it.

Nice texture and presentation: I liked it because you could make it a day ahead and then get it ready right before guests arrive. I didn't have any left over, so these were a hit.
