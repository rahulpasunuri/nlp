I made this dish for a Seder that I catered. I thought this recipe was delicious, as did the guests. It took a little more matzo than called for. I poured the hot mixture into an oiled, plastic wrap-covered disposable pie pan and cooled it completely. Then I heated the oil in a non-stick pan and slid the entire disk into the oil to brown. Even so, I found it impossible to brown because the polenta softened and started falling apart. I ended up giving up and warming it in the oven just before serving. During my test run, I did not use any mushrooms and the mixture was stiffer and easier to brown. My disk of cooled polenta was also thinner than the one I did for the event.

Made this for seder and it was a big hit. I cut down a bit on the porcini, added a ton of fresh chopped basil. Chilled it and browned it in a pan before serving (great way to get it to room temp which was all it needed). Delicious with the sauce from the veal roast I made.

I made this last year and it was delicious. I followed the previous poster's suggestion to fry it whole and that worked well. The only change I'll make is to make sure to spread it in a thinner layer to cool.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for the frying technique: heeding the advice of other reviewers, I chilled it, kept it whole, sauteed it, flipped the disk to brown the other side, then sliced it. It was a big hit. I am a mushroom-lover, but felt the porcini flavor was a bit too strong. Next time I will use less and maybe mix in some fresh mushrooms, too.

I made this 2 years ago for Passover & again this year. It was a big hit both years. It was easy to make & extremely easy to serve. Improvements over year 1: Instead of frying it in wedges, I fried it as a whole "pie" & then cut with a very sharp knife before serving. Chilling it before cooking is a must! A little additional salt is needed to enhance the flavor since the matzo is a little plain.

Delicious! Being a polenta fanatic I was skeptic to try a matzo meal version, however, it it fairly easy to prepare and the smell from the onion, basil and porcini is fantastic. It is rather on the softer side so frying it was tricky but definitely worth it.

Our family (16 of us) loved this. However, you must let it chill, put parchment paper in the pan and then give it a quick saute before serving (I turned it into a fry pan with a little olive oil and then wedged it - like a frittata). I also kicked it up a notch with some sage and more basil

I had the same problem as Margalite. The slices were not nearly as firm as polenta should be. I realized I was doomed and should've stuck to tried and true recipes when the wedges completely stuck to my pan and fell apart. I even tried some in a grill pan, to no avail. Although the mixture was certainly edible and tasted good, I would not serve the mess to my guests. Frankly, I don't see how it could have turned into firm wedges and was extremely displeased with this recipe. So I scraped it together and have been eating it as soft Passover polenta mush throughout the week!

This was a great passover week recipe. It tasted delicious, but it definitely didn't look that appetizing. The pieces don't hold their shape very well. I used portobella and shitake mushrooms, and for the kids I just added parmesan cheese to the matza meal/soup recipe. Delicious!

This received rave reviews at our Seder. I made it the day before and refrigerated it overnight. Sliced it into wedges and put them in the pan to fry while we were serving soup. Perfect timing. A little last minute intensive, but well worth it and tasted great with a standing rib roast!

We just had this for our holiday in Jerusalem, together with the rest of your menu. We all loved it and were happy to find something new and different for the holiday. I just passed the recipe along to two other friends.

This was a serious disaster at yesterday's seder. The mixture took extra time to "thicken" and I hoped it was "thick-enough" so placed it in the pie-plate to 'let stand until firm'. That would be never! I had my doubts when starting to "cut" it to make wedges and fry them ... it could NOT hold its shape and would not even make a latke on the griddle! Next hope, add two eggs and put in oven to make some-kind-of-matza-kugel ... that did not come out firm either. It is still an oozing, albeit tasty, mess. I can't figure what to do with it next. I am hoping chilling it has firmed it into something useful!
