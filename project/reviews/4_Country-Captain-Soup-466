This is one of my absolute favorite soups. Unique flavors, great for girlie dinners & a movie, and my husband asks for it by name. Mmm...

Made this for a soup swap because it's a bit different. Very popular; even a year later, at the next swap, people remarked how they enjoyed it.

TWO SOUPS FOR THE WORK OF ONE&. I agree that this is a very nice soup for a chilly evening, and I made it last night for the first time. My rating would actually be 3.5 stars as it could do with a bit of tweaking, but as a staring point for personal preferences I think it is wonderful. I too made it with three ½ chicken breasts and as with another reviewer I cooked them whole and cubed them while the pasta and currents were cooking and then added them back in. I also agree, up to a point, that there is not enough broth, but I found this to be a positive in the end. After my wife and I had about a serving and a half with an adequate amount of broth last night I refrigerated the leftovers consisting mostly meat and vegetables. This morning I added a teaspoon and a half of curry to a tablespoon of butter and heated for a minute or so, added a can of light coconut and brought it to a simmer, added the leftovers from the previous evening and as it began to heat up added a handful or so of fresh baby spinach and cooked it just until the spinach was done. The new incarnation was equal to if not slightly better than the first and they are sufficiently different so that it avoids the stigma of second time around.

I first started making this recipe when it was first published in 1995, and it is still a hit at my house! It is perfect as written, although I hardly ever have an apple to put in it. The cilantro is a sooo yummy in it. It is also a very simple recipe - doesn't take a lot of prep or cook time. Love it!

Marvelous, simply marvelous. Added garam marsala as recommend. Wonderful complexity of flavors and perfect for cold weather! Will make again and again!

This is a fabulous soup. The only thing I did differently is used chicken breasts and I did not include the apple. Fabulous. It makes the house smell really good, too!

Rating: 4
I love this soup and I've been making it since it appeared in the magazine. It is one of my go-to favorites. I often use chicken breast instead of thighs, just be sure to cook the chicken breasts whole in the soup and then shred. Otherwise it gets too tough.

Rating: 4
Everyone liked this and the leftovers were even better so don't hesitate to make this dish in advance. I used thighs and breast meat and the breast meat got a little tough so next time just thighs. If I was making this for big eaters or needed to stretch the dish I'd double the pasta or substitute rice and put it in the bottom of the serving bowls. Don't skip the yogurt.

Rating: 4
Very flavorful and hearty soup. Love it. I wouldn't change anything in the recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this as a chicken dish instead of a soup. I reduced the amount of broth, used golden raisins and simmered chicken breasts in the sauce until tender. Left out the orzo and served it on top of rice. Next time I might try pineapple instead of apples and a sprinkle of toasted coconut.

Rating: 4
Very tasty, easy and unique. I made it once wtih madras-style curry powder and once with regular curry powder; both were good, but the madras gave it a bit more zip.

Loved it!! I added more broth, like many of the other reviewers. The soup has a sweet/savory taste. Made me think of an autumn day.

Rating: 2
I found this soup just okay. I did omit the currants and orzo, though. If I make it again, I'd have to tweak it.

This was delish! Like some other cooks, I used garam masala instead of curry powder, otherwise followed recipe. Whole family liked this one Will make again!

Best made the day before serving. I added more curry, more broth, a large can of tomatoes, more raisins and more orzo as these are the things we like. Really good.

Tasty! I didn't have the currants I tought I did, but golden raisins added were delicious!

I made this for my Herb Society meeting and everyone loved it. There were no leftovers! I made it the day before and I think this helped it blend its flavors. I doubled the recipe.

Loved this! Very different and easy. Great for a winter night. Three of us ate this and there was not much left. Think I will add more broth next time.

Rating: 4
Instead of orzo, I cooked rice separately and using an ice cream scoop, put a scoop in the middle of a shallow bowl. I then ladeled the soup around the rice and garnished as directed. This is a very fragrant dish!

What a nice cold winters night soup, and it was COLD! Grating more apple when served on it is good. Will make this again for sure.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this soup. I considered not adding the orzo or currants at the end as the soup tasted fine before these additions, but both made a difference. The orzo made the soup almost creamy and while the currants didn't seem noticable they imparted a subtle flavour. I loved the way the apple blended in as a vegetable.

Rating: 4
This is a great soup receipe! My only change is to add a handful of chopped crystalized ginger instead of the ground ginger.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Very simple and quick. Added snap peas since I had some in the fridge but I think any vegetable addition would be great (esp. potato, mushroom, or carrot). I would add a second apple next time, and a bit later in the cooking process, as they practically disappeared by the time it was through. Big hit with my husband who *used to* hate soup.

Rating: 4
Really good, and quick. I add more of all the ingredients, especially the orzo and currents and serve it more like a stew. The toppings really bring all the flavors to life!!!

This was FABULOUS! Will definitely be a staple in our house. Very interesting combination of flavors.

Simple & delicious! Great chicken soup to serve when family is sick with colds. Or anytime - I like to spice it up with a can of Rotel tomatoes too.

Outstanding!!! I didn't change a thing. First 4 forks I've given a recipe. Great for a cold winter night in front of the fire!!

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was fantastic. I substituted raisins for the currents and used mild curry paste from a jar instead of curry powder, which I think gave it a more intense curry flavor. It took a while to prepare, with all the chopping, but it was worth it, and it made enough for three meals.

Rating: 3
I made this for a casual dinner with friends. One friend kept saying that it was "soooo good!" I may add more currants next time - they were a sweet surprise in this "zesty" soup.

Rating: 4
Really great. Made it to the letter. You could probably leave out the orzo or double it and not notice much either way. Maybe I'd double the currants, too, not for flavor, but for what they add in color. But don't leave out the yogurt -- that really made it. Also, I used homemade chicken stock. And I cut the chicken thighs from the bones; if you do that, you can throw bones in a separate pot and make more stock at the same time as this soup.

Rating: 4
I have been making this recipe for 10 years and it never gets old and everyone always loves it. I simply serve it with ciabatta bread. Easy schmeasy. From the start I've used dried cranberries instead of currants and I leave the skin on the apple.

Rating: 2
I too used Garam Masala instead of Curry Powder and uped the chilies quite a bit, still I found this soup a little boring. I have a recipe for mulligatawny which I like better.

Rating: 4
Just the right amount of spiciness and heat! I substituted an equal amount of Garam Masala instead of the Curry powder. Definitely make this the day before you serve it, so flavors blend completely. Add orzo just 5-7 minutes before serving.

Rating: 2
I'm just not sure what all amazing reviews are about. This soup was kind of interesting but I wasn't at all blown away like the other folks.

Rating: 3
On a snowy afternoon, some friends came up from the city for a surprise visit. We all agreed soup would be just the thing for dinner, but what would we make quickly that would also be flavorful and hearty? Searching on Epicurious rewarded us yet again! We all loved this soup - my kids were fascinated that we were putting apples in the mix! I did use chicken breasts not having dark meat on hand, and put in elbow macaroni as I had no smaller pasta. I'd love to make it again exactly as suggested. I agree that it is a bit hotter than some folks like, so seasonings can be adjusted for a slightly milder flavor. We'll definitely make it again!

I just got through putting up a crockpot full of Chicken Country Captain and decided to check the recipe to see if I had added all of the necessary ingredients. That is when I saw this recipe - and almost fainted. This is the exact same recipe that I just used to make CCC as a main dish, with less broth of course. While I have not actually made this recipe - I will! Hey maybe I will just add more broth to the leftovers and adjust the seasoning. I think I will add the rice instead of the orzo too, because I am serving the main dish with rice as well. The yogurt and cillantro seem just the thing to top it with. I can't wait to taste this. CCC has been a favorite since my childhood and my mother only made it on "special" occasions......... Now I have two ways to make it! Hoorah!

I loved this recipe and you do not have to change any of the ingredients even though I did put in a chicken breast along with the thighs. The flavors were wonderful and the presentation with the yogurt and cilantro on top was exceptional!

Rating: 4
so yummy! If you let it cook for about 40 minutes post adding apples, the apples basically dissolve giving it a nice sweetness. With the cilantro and yogurt it is soooooo yummy! I can't wait to make it again.

Rating: 3
Wonderful recipe. I did something a bit different with this soup (as I do with many soups). I made the base (everything except the starch..the orzo). I then cooked basmati rice separately. I served the basmati rice with the soup on top - it soon was all together and looked and tasted just like soup with rice. I then froze the rest of the base. I find that starch, especially rice, once frozen and thawed becomes mushy. By doing it this way, I can add fresh rice when I thaw the frozen base. We found it to be a little on the hot side so I might go easy on the heat and adjust at the end.

This came out just like I hoped it would and was exactly what I wanted. I like dark meat, but I wanted to use up some chicken breasts, so I prepared the soup as directed but without putting the meat in at the beginning. Then after it had simmered for a while I put the chicken in, cubed fairly small, and covered it and turned the heat off. After sitting for 5 or 10 minutes the chicken was perfectly cooked and really tender and yummy. The only other changes I made were using butter, because I like it with curry powder, and a green pepper, since I figured this soup already had a lot of color and sweetness, and I served it over rice. Putting pasta in it just seemed weird. Also, I stirred in a big handful of cilantro right at the end. If you like this, I recommend the curried lentil soup.

Rating: 3
This soup was great. Really 3 1/2 stars, if that were an option. I subbed Basmati rice for the orzo, and that worked well, also raisins for the currants. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a more interesting chicken soup, without it being *too* unusual. Good comfort food.

Rating: 4
This is an easy recipe and has wonderful flavor. I have given the recipe to everyone I have made it for. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs make it easy to put together. I have used raisins instead of currents and it still works. Can't wait to make it again!

Unbelievably good! I used Dean & DeLuca's Hot Curry blend and it was very spicy. Will make this often1

Rating: 3
This was an relatively easy to make and very satisfying. Do not skip the yogurt or cilantro; they truly add a nice balance to the spicyness. I did have some trouble imparting the thigh meat from all of the fat and skin; any suggestions?

Rating: 3
My mother's side of the family is from the Carribean, so I truly enjoy a great curry. I thought this soup was great to satisfy a craving when the "real thing" is not available. The orzo seemed out of place in the recipe in terms of texture and flavor and it added little interest. I believe next time I will add potatoes, butternut squash, cassava (also called yuca), eddo, or a similar vegetable to thicken the broth and add body instead. A great cold weather dish to warm you up!

Really good, really easy, really fast. I would prefer the apple grated next time. Will make again!

Fantastic, left out the currants and apple and added extra ginger.Everyone wanted the recipe.This will become a regular in our house!

Very good, and very easy. I used golden raisins instead of the currants, and it turned out well. Also, the orzo is more of an option than a requirement, it didn't affect the dish at all. We'll definitely make this often.

Excellent tasting soup - full of flavor! I hosted a soup/salad brunch with 12 friends. This was one of four soups that I had prepared using recipes from your site. This was the winner and received a four star rating with recipe requests from all my friends. I also just fixed it for my husband (who had been out of town) and he loved it too. The one change I had to make was I could not find the orzo where we live, so I used a product of mexico - a type of macaroni called melon seed and added a little more than 1/4 of a cup and it worked just as well. I am forwarding the recipe to my sister-in-laws as I know they will love it too.

I made this soup last winter and loved it. It's quick and delicious. I look forward to making this recipe again, now that the weather is cooler.

This soup was wonderful! Easy, colorful, healthy and delicious -- my kids ate it all up and so did their parents. We skipped the crushed red pepper -- I might add just a few shakes for adults only. Great meal with bread.

This has been our standard chicken soup for several years. We always add a cup of corn kernels, which is a great addition, and increase the orzo to 1/3 cup. Sometimes we use chicken breasts, but thighs are definitely better.

Fast, easy, hearty. Nice blend of flavours. Worth trying. Definitely regular recipe. I added extra cilantro in the simmer process. Also, did half curry powder and half garam marsala spice.

I added about 3-4 times as much orzo to make it thicker and also tossed in the cilantro versus a garnish. It's a good and easy dish.

Very nice combination. It took 10 minutes to cook orzo. And I substituted chicken breast for thighs, and dried cranberries for the currants.
