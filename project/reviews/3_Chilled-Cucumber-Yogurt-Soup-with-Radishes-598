I like foods with strong flavor - and this recipe doesn't disappoint. I loved the mix of the cool creamy cucumber stock with the spicy seasonings. I like spicy food so much, I added more than the recipe called for. I made this as a first course for a light spring supper, my guests raved. My husband asked me to keep this soup in heavy rotation. I have a hard time keeping him from consuming it all before guests arrive.

Disagree with the previous reviewer - this is a great recipe, esp if you enjoy Middle East flavours. Nice variant: adding fresh grated ginger instead of ground ginger.

Not liking cucumbers myself, I thought I'd make this for my family who love them. They were not very impressed. Perhaps the cumin and curry are not flavors they associate with cucumbers.

Great starter for an Indian meal. The recipe as printed has too much salt. Also will cut back on the cumin and curry powder next time as it overpowers the cucumber.
