I love this dip. The combination of mint and white cheddar is amazing. I woudl never have expected it.

This is a great spread. I've made it twice to rave reviews each time. The lemon zest is a must do to freshen this up. I believe the key is quality goat cheese and cheddar and whole milk which is what the recipe calls for after all. I am hoping to experiment with ways to adjust with the seasons.

I liked this recipe. I only rated it as "good" due to the loose consistency. I felt it should have been just a bit thicker without having it get to the cold stage to acquire it. Definitely will make again!

What a shame. This was disappointing for my friends and I. It was tasty but no where near WOW! I've always had good luck with recipes from the site, especially the highly rated ones, but this is the first time a reciepe has not been a hit with any of us.I can't put my finger on what it was that didn't work. I followed the recipe to a T, even with all the fresh ingredients (which isn't always easy in the Caribbean). I was so looking forward to adding a new dip to my list. Will have to keep looking.

Easy & delicious. The mint and lemon zest made this dish.

I have asparagus coming out of my ears from the garden. Tried this recipe for a girls Bunco night...big hit! The lemon really makes this creamy dip successful. I will make this again(seeing I have more asparagus). Baguette was good, but will try the tortilla chips this time.

I made this for a girl's beach weekend. It was easy to make and I made it in the morning and just warmed it up for our happy hour appetizer. I didn't have mint so it was still delicious without it.

This was a great dip - brought it to a party and it was absolutely devoured in no time. I made a lot of changes depending on what I had on hand (no artichokes, rosemary and thyme instead of chives, mint and parsley, heavy cream and 2% instead of whole milk, forgot the lemon zest - oops!), but it came out really well despite that. I love a recipe that stands up to being messed with! Several people commented that it would be tasty with mushrooms, so I'll try that next time as well. Oh yes, there WILL be a next time!

I thought this was delicious. A different take on the traditional artichoke dip. I used feta instead of the goat cheese as that is what I had on hand. Also added more lemon zest. Next time I might add even more mint and parsley. It was very fresh and light tasting and it's a nice mixture of vegetables.

I served this as an appectizer on Easter. Delicious!

I made this recipe for a party and this was a huge hit! Served with thinly- sliced and toasted baguette. I didn't have whole milk on hand and substituted with heavy cream (seemed to work just as well). Would definitely make again and have shared the recipe with several family and friends.

Loved this - made 1/2 of recipe and used up different vegetables I had on hand in fridge. Reheated wonderfully as well. Will definitely make again.

As a lover of all things creamy and cheesy, I was very excited to try this recipe. Sad to say, I was very disappointed with this dish. Good but nowhere near great.

Made for a dinner party and it came out really well. For those who like a cheese dip, this was not super cheesy in your face and it was great with the spring vegetables. Super easy to prepare ahead of time and pop in the oven. Served with tortilla chips.
