Excellent! Perfect dish for two and could be scalable for a group. Substituted whole wheat bread crumbs, fresh grated parmesan and bone-in lamb shoulder for plain bread crumbs, pecorino romano and rack of lamb respectively. Broiled crust at the finish for 2 minutes to give it a bit more crunch. Accompanied the dish with roasted brussel sprouts and a simple baked potato with pasture butter for an amazing complete meal.

We made these chops for Boxing Day dinner, and they were fantastic. We barbequed instead of roasted, but the rub was fantastic and easy!

This was delicious!Although it did take longer than 30 min. to reach med. rare.It took closer to 40-45 min. Very good though!

I have made this recipe several times and it is my husbands favorite for rack of lamb. HOWEVER, we grill the racks rather than roasting them. I really press the crust on the meaty side of the rack and we grill them "low and slow." The flavor is exceptional and definitely a keeper in our house. PS We grill outside year 'round!!

Very, very good, but next time I might give it a minute or two under the broiler to crisp the crust further. Otherwise, phenomenal.

This was excellent! I used trimmed lamb racks, and made the crust a few hours ahead and kept it in the fridge. I added a little more oil for 'crust' texture and used cilantro instead of basil. I firmly pressed it over the lamb about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick. When guests arrived, I popped it into the oven and enjoyed champagne with them while it cooked. So easy to prepare, but VERY elegant. My guests were impressed! Served it with a lemon/parmesan risotto and a green salad. Cooked it exactly as directed, and it was PERFECT! This one is slated for many dinner parties to come!

I've made this for 2 people up to 10 and it's always been a big hit.

Delicious except lamb was overcooked. 30 minutes is too long for medium-rare. I will make this again but cook for 20 minutes and then remove from oven to sit for 10 minutes.

After all the rave reviews, I was expecting a blockbuster for x-mas eve dinner. It was just O.K. I think I should have browned the Lamb rack first and cut off the layer of fat on top to enhance the flavors and get rid of the chewy bit. I bought high quality frenched rack from Whole Foods market, so that wasn't the issue.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful and not at all difficult to make. My husband is not a lamb lover, but did not stop raving about how delicious it was! I will absolutely make it again!

Quite possibly the best recipe on the site... and that is saying something!! This is very easy to make and is incredibly delicious!!! Your guests will rave. It is a family favorite. Last year I made it when my parents were in town and for the whole summer my Mom impressed her friends with it at dinner parties. The best thing is you can prepare it ahead and cook right before serving. So you wont be in the kitchen during your whole party (unless the party is in the kitchen!)

wow! i love lamb, and thiswas fabulous, made it for a large dinner party that i catered. the flavor penetrated the lamb to the bone, I was a little overwhelmed by the excess of crust, thought it distracted from the lamb meat, so I just rubbed it off of mine, but guests at the party ate them as they were and raved.

I seared the racks first, and brought them to room temp before roasting. Everyone loved the meal. I expected the crust to be a little crispier, but it really infused great flavor into the lamb.

This is a delicious and easy recipe that is sure to impress. The herb crust is so tasty; my husband and I couldn't stop raving about it.

We made this dish for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous! We used 3 racks of Icelandic lamb and trippled the recipe. All of our guests raved over the lamb, and coming from seven 3 & 4-star restaruant employees, that's quite a compliment!

After all the rave reviews I was expecting a bit more. It was very good, but I was hoping for a knock-the-socks-off-the-guests recipe, and that it is not. With one of the racks I trimmed the fat off completely, and both my girlfriend and I thought it was considerably better than the others. (And we're not afraid of fat.) Overall, a keeper.

I used a Costo rack of lamb - it was wonderful (although I will try it with Colordo lamb if I can find it). Very easy to make, tastey, even my not-so-crazy-about-lamb husband said it's a keeper!

First, I'd love the recipe for the Potatoes Stuffed w Leek Mousse mentioned below!!The lamb was excellent, easy, and delicious. Suggestions: searing the rack in a pan fat-side-down before rubbing it w breadcrimb mixture will serve dual purpose of 1) keeping the crust from cracking & falling off while cooking & 2) negate the need to further trim fat from a frenched rack.

Super good and super presentation - I agree w/the cook who said let sit at room temp ~45 min. before roasting. Served w/potatoes stuffed with Leek Mousse - wonderful!

I bought a pre-frenched lamb rack at costco and did this recipe. Wow was it good. When I thought of the money I saved it was even better.

As a professional Chef I would like to say that I really enjoyed preparing this dish. I would like to add if prepared with Australian Rack of Lamb. The Australian Lamb adapts prefectly to this recipe. I might want to add. Leave Rack of lamb at room temp for 45mins the flavors of the mustard and herbs penitrate into the lamb becomes more flavorful. This will go perfect with rainbow peppercorn and garlic roasted gem potatoes, and roasted asaparagus with roasted peppers. My wine recomdation should be a Australin Shiraz or a Pinot Noir. Vintage 1999 to 2001. Happy eatting.

Yummy, easy, expensive. I served it with roasted "vegetables glazed with balsamic vinegar" and "roaseted new potatoes with shallots and sage". It was a very special dinner highlighting the lamb.

My husband and I made this dish as a part of our special Valentine's Day dinner. In our 5 years of cooking together, this is the best entree we have ever made. It was so easy, and the crust turned out perfectly crispy and tasty. The only issue we had was that the meat was slightly too pink and had cooled too much after resting for 15 mins. Next time I will pop it back in the oven for 5 minutes or so just before serving. Make sure you buy good quality meat as this will make or break the dish.

Use prime lamb and this is delicious! The crust adds so much flavor. You'll never have lamb this good even in a restaurant!
