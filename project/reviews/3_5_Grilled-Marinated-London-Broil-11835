This marinade is so good it would make a shoe tasty. Soak London broil in some and you're good to go. I've made this three times now and I think good balsamic, the lemon juice and the olive oil are musts; the rest of the ingredients can be played with. I've used fresh herbs instead of dried and it really punches up the flavor. In any case, this is a good recipe to have in your arsenal; it takes just a few minutes to assemble and then you can forget about the meat for a while.

Fantasitc. I marinaded London Broil Lamb cuts for 3 hours on the counter with this marinade and then broiled them on high on the top rack for about 6 minutes on each side. IT really helped that "gamey" taste of lamb and made the meat delicious. Everyone LOVED it.

I tried this recipe this evening to good results. Niether London broil nor flank steak are cuts of meat you can find in Holland. There is nothing similar to it at all. So I used what I did have available, entrecotes or sirloin steaks. I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the amount of olive oil to just 1/2 cup. I allowed the steaks to marinade for 4 hours, before grilling, on the BBQ. They turned out very flavorful. This will definitely go in my 'keeper' file and we will use the marinade during again during BBQ season.

This seemed like such a failsafe list of ingredients, but it just didn't work for me. Just not a lot of flavor.

OK recipe - my husband thought it had too much mustard. We're going back to our usual flank steak marinade obtained from a long-time Gourmet enthusiast: 1/2 c oil, 1/3 c soy sauce, fresh garlic, fresh ginger, chopped scallions, few red pepper flakes, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 c wine (white or red). Always gets great reviews. Liked so much, my 15-yr old volunteers to marinate on occasion - when he does, he adds some OJ.

The olive oil could be omitted until ready to grill, as it coagulates in the fridge. I was surprised by how mediocre this turned out. Definitely for those who like tart/sour tastes, which I do, but even I thought the vinegar and lemon were overpowering. It is an OK recipe.

This recipe is one of those I have kept in my repetoire since I saw it in the magazine way back when. It is great, really flavorful. I just made this again last night for out of town guest... and it was a huge hit, as always. (as in, I was asked for the recipe) This time I had a flank steak, which turns out great. Simply marinated overnight, grilled and served over linguini that was sauteed quickly with simply good olive oil,1 clove of garlic & grape tomatoes just till tomatoes start to show heat wilt. Served with the steak, sliced on diagonal and laid on top.. so flavorful & yum! tried and true.

very good london broil recipe. usually, i find london broil to be the least exciting item in our rotation (we are poor and need cheap items for most meals) but this was pretty tasty. the quality of meat in a LB is still fairly low (and so there were some tough parts, some chewy parts) but it's better than usual! we will be using this next time we make LB.

THIS IS A GREAT MARINADE! HOWEVER I DID MAKE A FEW CHANGES. I DID NOT DISCARD THE REMAINING MARINADE- INSTEAD I BASTED THE MEAT AS I GRILLED. I ALSO ONLY USED 1/2 OF THE OIL- I SPRAYED THE GRILL BEFORE I PUT THE MEAT ON- AND I ADDED A TSP. OF CHILI POWDER TO GIVE IT A LITTLE KICK.

This was a great dish. It'll be my new standard london broil recipe. So much flavor. I had no lemons, so I substituted conc. lime juice, and would do so again. I, too only used about 1/3 olive oil. I marinated over nite, about 30 hours. I forgot to add the dry seasonings until about an hour before broiling, but it came out great. I boiled the marinade and served with dinner, and my husband drowned his plate with it. He usually complains about cheaper beef, but he loved this. Great, I can save money!

This was perfect for my casual dinner party with friends. I was able to prep the day before using ingredients already in my kitchen, and roasted the meat instead of grilling. I tried boiling down the marinade for sauce, but it didn't look appealing so I tossed it. It wasn't missed - the meat is great on its own. Everyone raved about it and I'm looking forward to making it again.

Funny - now that I've made this recipe & have come back to review it myself, I realize that I did almost all the same things that "A Cook from Las Vegas, NV" did: I used a tri-tip, unintentionally marinated it for 48 hrs, then boiled down the marinade to use as a sauce for the meat. And, as yet another reviewer noted, I too have all the ingredients for this recipe right in my kitchen, which is nice. I cooked my roast in the oven - seared it at 425º F, then lowered the temp & cooked it at 350º F until medium-rare. The meat came out tender, flavorful & juicy. Served this with creamed spinach - a heavenly dinner when it's cold outside. I'll make this over again, since it also reminds me of the marinade my mom has always used for London Broil, which I'll try with this marinade next time.

This marinade was delicious. I only had about six hours to marinate the london broil and even with tenderizing it was still a little tough. Make sure to marinate overnight like the directions say and it should turn out great.

This is a very nice marinate--light, just enough flavor. I dislike eating meat thath as been soaked in soy sauce...

I've made this recipe so many times that I finally had to print a fresh copy. My only modification is to reduce the oil from 2/3 cup to 1/3 cup. We purchase our London Broil at Costco. It is cut about 4 inches thick. I grill it on all four sides about 6 minutes each, and then finish in the oven with convection heat 350 degrees until electronic thermometer reaches 125 degrees. Excellent for company and also makes a great week night dinner.

Delish! I broiled it instead of grilling because although I *thought* I had propane, I didn't. Smoked up the house but was yummy and tender. Maybe on the grill 9-10 minutes per side is right, but under the broiler, unless you like your meat well done, you don't want to cook it that long. I went for about 7-8 minutes per side and it was perfect. Also definitely go with the longer marinade time - 24 hours at least.

I have made london broil frequently using Stubb's beef marinade from a bottle. I thought I'd put a bit more effort in and try this recipe. Stubb's wins hands down and is quicker. I didn't feel I could really taste the marinade (I did it overnight) much. It needs more kick. Not bad, just not great.

We charbroiled a London Broil last night after letting the meat marinate in this recipe for about 28 hours. It was really good. The marinate is not heavy; it adds a nice flavor without over powering the flavor of the beef. I used fresh herbs rather than dry ones. I also used a fork to poke some holes in the meat and recommended by another reviewer. I would definately make this again. I paired it with roasted potatoes with rosmary and garlic.

Marinated for almost about 18 hours. Wonderful results. What few leftovers we had made great sandwiches. As for those who complain about the toughness of the meat, that is not the recipe's fault.

I prepared the recipe verbatim, even using country dijon (Maille), and added tsp. of rosemary; and cooked it using an old piece of meat found in the back of the freezer (with a hole in the wrap) (and marinaded for 6 hours)and it turned out phenomenal.

My daughter, who just moved into her first townhouse and is learning to cook, decided to try this recipe last night when she made dinner for guests. She was nervous, so I went over to help, but she really didn't need much help because the recipe was easy to follow. We broiled top round steak at 500 degrees until it read "medium rare" on the meat thermometer and then sliced it very thin. We served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The meal was wonderful. This marinade is a keeper, although I plan to reduce the Worcestershire when I use it. On Sunday, for a special meal with her boyfriend, my daughter is planning to marinade fillet mignon and then sear the steak in butter in a skillet on top of the stove.

I would definitely make this again. I just hope to be able to try it out on the grill next time!

I have made this twice now. 2nd time I reduced the worstershire sauce, I can't stand the smell of it. Also took some marinade, boiled it added beef stock, some leftover tomato paste and mushrooms and reduce to make a nice but pungent gravy. Also agree with other reviewer, if tough it was probably over cooke and sliced to thick. 7 minutes per side, nice and pink inside. Leftovers were great on gyro bread with fixins! Love this site!

Was easy and delish. I grilled for about 6 minutes per side to finish med. rare, 9 to 10 minutes per side would have ruined it (unless you obtain a very think London Broil). I think the reviewers that said london broil was tough either got a bad cut (or wrong cut) of meat or did not slice properly, mine was very tender. Will certainly make again.

This recipe is a keeper. The marinade takes only minutes to pull together (I doubled the red pepper flakes for more heat). I followed the suggestion of previous triers by making a sauce to accompany it - I made a reduction of equal parts marinade & beef broth. I let it reduce while the meat was on the grill. It couldn't have been simpler!

This is the second time I've made this recipe. I am a personal chef & my last client raved about this so Idecied to do it again for another client. First of all, I did not broil it. I pan seared it in a grill pan to sear in the juices. After browning well on both sides I popped the whole pan into a 425 degree oven for about 10 minutes. My cut was rather thick so I brought the temp up to 125 degrees, let it sit 10 minutes & sliced it really thin. Went one step further & deglazed the pan with a good shiraz wine, reduced it a bit, added 1/2 c beef stock, thinly sliced mushrooms (actually shitake & portobellos) & a dash or two of some GOOD balsamic vinegar, salt & freshly ground pepper & let it reduce. Talk about dying & going to heaven....

Absolutely FANTASTIC! I marinated the meat only two hours (at room temberature) and it was heavenly. 135 degrees is perfect, but be sure to use a thick cut of meat. Also, instead of discarding the liquid, I reduced it in a sauce pan and then used it to accompany the meat. It has an intense flavor, so warn everyone to use it sparingly - but it still got rave reviews. Too bad you can only give Four Forks - this is one of those rare recipes that should have FIVE FORKS.

I have used this marinade repeatedly since my discovery of it in 1999. Each time, it was superb! I also used it in modified form during Xmas. I decreased the red wine vinegar by 3/4 and the mustard by 1/2 in order to marinate a beef tenderloin. The result was perfect; the garlic and herbs gave the meat a wonderfull flavor, but without the strong mustard or vinegar taste that really was not needed for this cut of meat.

This is an outstanding marinade. Only item I changed was the doubling of the dried hot red pepper. I also marinated it for 32 hours. My cut of meat was particulary thick. Even though I grilled it for about 15 minutes on each side, I was afraid it would not be cooked enough. When I sliced it it was very red and yet warm in the middle. The taste was sensational. This is the best marinade I have ever used for beef. We just finished eating about thirty minutes ago and I want to open the fridge and have another slice just thinking about the taste of the meat with the marinade.

I never cooked london broil before and it turned out great with this recipe. I did use red wine vinegar in place of red wine. I marinated for about 20 hours, turning once.

One can marinate a London broil in any Italian dressing, add a little cumin, or cinnamon, and not have it turn out so well. Bravo! Great recipe! It will replace my standard (Guess?). Two variations: Marinate for 24 hours; use lime juice instead of lemon juice.

Absolutely fabulous!!!The longer you marinate, the better. My meat thermometer was on the fritz, so I followed the time recommendation. The meat was almost well done. It was still terrific even though I prefer medium-rare. Next time I'll increase the temperature, decrease the time and it will be heaven. I'm having an afternoon cocktail party this weekend and plan to thin slice it as an appetizer. I'll make extra marinade to try as a dipping sauce.

This is an excellent recipe! I never knew how to cook a London Broil. I found this site and this recipe and am quite pleased with the overall simplicity of the recipe and the delicious end result! My compliments and thank you for sharing! May I make a suggestion. Make a little extra marinading sauce for dipping as you eat the meat.

My whole family found this recipe delicious and so easy to make. My two year old even had a blast counting out the ingredients too. My mother has also tried this recipe and found it wonderful too. Add a little salad and some herbed potatoes and dinner is served. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I marinated the beef overnight and into the next day, about 18 hours. The smell drove everyone nuts while it was grilling, it was that good. I would definitely make it again.

I did not have overnight so I marinated it about 7 hours It was still flavorful. My family loved it I would make again.

Wow. The first and so far the only recipe that I didn't care for. The marinade that the other folks raved about was a _huge_ disappointment. But hey, don't take my word. I made the mistake of taking someone else's.
