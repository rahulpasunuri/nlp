We made this for Thanksgiving. It was delicious. I would probably use more juniper next time.

Very subtle, yet very intriguing. For a better presentation, I layered the potatoes with the sauce and seasoning instead of mixing it all in together.

Juniper is common in the northeastern United States...it's sweetish, round and grows on the Juniper, an evergreen. Good for I,ll probably cut back on the cream. breathing ailments, I use it in Sauerbraten. I can't wait to try this recipe.

Very tasty! Nice change from the standard nutmeg. Came across as lighter in texture somehow. I thought it made plenty for 6. Paired so well with venison, can imagine with duck, game hen, anything wild, roast pork .... so nice.
