Was a hit on a hot late summer night. I changed the mayonnaise for no fat plain yogurt, and changed the dill for coriander. Added a bit of sliced red onion to give it a bit of color and additional taste. Will definitely do it again.

This came out a little gooey - the flavor of the fennel got a bit lost in the mayo dressing. I will add some red cabbage or even radiccio next time for color and a bit more texture. But pretty good!

Very tasty fresh and tangy. The dill and lemon zext definitely make this dish. I'm not really sure how anyone could find this to have too much pepper.

Loved it! quick simple and delicious. Very flavorful and refreshing. The fresh dill and grated lemon peel are key. Didn't have apple cider vinegar on hand so i just used white wine vinegar. My husband raved about it just as much as i did. This will become a heavily rotated recipe in our kitchen. Served it with a really simple broiled flounder (olive oil, lemon, salt, pepper, dill) Perfect match.

I just returned (this evening) from River's End Inn and Restaurant. I was extremely impressed with this side dish. It was divine! So good in fact, that I am going to attempt to re-creaye it tomorrow night. Make sure that you slice the fennel very thinly!!! I highly suggest using a mandoline.

Too much pepper and my family didn't like it at all.

This is a really nice, light, crisp summer salad, and very easy to make. While best fresh, I've found that it even makes good leftovers the next day.

A nice alternative to cabbage cole slaw and I can understand why this is served with fish. This was very easy to make and the fennel and dill made the slaw distinctive. Two teaspoons of pepper may seem a lot, but it works out great.

My husband, who isn't crazy about fennel, loved this dish and made me promise to add it to my recipe file. Really good!
