I have been making these cakes since the recipe first appeared in Gourmet. I use a large cupcake pan and they've been a hit with everyone who has tasted them. I'm getting ready to bake them for dessert following a grilled pork loin with summer rice salad and baby carrots.

This is a lovely fall recipe. The individual cakes are perfect for a dinner party. For less formal occasions, this recipe can also be made in a 9 inch spring form pan (with the poached pears decoratively placed on top). Either way, delicious!

Ok recipe. A bit too dense for dessert. I sauteed the slightly instead of poaching. I added slivered almonds on top. Easy to make but not very light; even with added apple puree and dairy free margarine.

Cooked this because I just wanted to try something new. Have made it several times since! Fabulous!

This recipe is outstanding! one of the best new recipes I've tried in '06. But don't throw away the poaching liquid, drizzle it over the cakes at serving time and garnish with a few toasted sliced or slivered almonds. The cakes themselves have excellent almond flavor.

I saw this on CBS in a piece about styling food for photography and had to try it. Very easy, very fast, very pretty, and a perfect end to a savory autumn meal. I used Seckel pears cut in half and used small cupcake forms to make 24 tiny cakes. They were gorgeous, well reviewed by a varied group of dinner guests, and preferred to most traditional Thanksgiving desserts. I will make these again, substituting apricots or any other seasonal fruit, and varying the poaching liquid to suit. I will also try with Mascarpone or ice cream for a standalone dessert for our New Year's dinner. Congratulations on inventing a new tradition!
