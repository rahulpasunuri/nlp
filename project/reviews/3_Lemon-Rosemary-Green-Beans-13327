This is a lovely simple way to make green beans. I highly recommend it. I more than doubled the cooking time on the beans, because I hate that rubbery texture of lightly cooked green beans. Then I threw them in the pan with the butter to warm them through.

This was simple, tasty, and a nice change from more typical preparations. I recommend it.

I thought this was very good. I trimmed the beans first then steamed them and made "bundles" by tying them together with a chive leaf. Made for a beautiful presentation. I thought the sauce was quite good - just added a bit more zest.

This was very good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some balsamic vinegar and fresh squeezed lemon juice to add punch and to ensure there was enough sauce to coat all the green beens. My family really enjoyed this.

This dish is delicious for the avid green bean lover. I did add a little more lemon than called for to give more zing and the whole house loved them!

This was good, but it could have been more flavorful. Next time I would consider omitting some of the butter adding some olive oil and lemon juice, maybe even some garlic and more rosemary.

Quick excellent light flavored veggie side-dish. I took this to a pot-luck and people raved over the scent as they rounded the buffet. I steamed the beans for 20 minutes (cooked, but firm) added a little extra butter and lemon juice for seasoning.

This recipe has been a winner every time I've made it and with a variety of different main dishes. It's also a great dish if you don't want to fuss but want a vegetable with a great flavour.

It was good but I added some balsamic vinegar because I thought there wasn't enough sauce to toss over all the beans and get good distribution. The lemon zest was delicious, next time I'd add more than the recipe calls for.

Although I followed the recipe exactly the flavor of rosemary was overwhelming in this dish. My son commented that this must be what it's like to chew on a pine tree - certainly no compliment. I was very disappointed with the results & have deleted this recipe from my recipe box.

Served this with a Prime Rib, etc. for Christmas dinner - and it's now a family favorite. Nice, light flavors to accompany the heavier meal.

Excellent green bean dish. The lemon and rosemary worked well together and complement the uncomplicated flavor of roasted meat.

This is a lovely, simple green bean recipe. It's very versatile - I can't imagine a main dish that it wouldn't go well with. When I made these for Thanksgiving, everyone commented on how good they were and wanted to know what was in them. I'll definitely be making this recipe on a regular basis.

This worked great as a veggie side dish to a large meal that had some pretty strong menu items in it. The fresh rosemanry and lemon added much needed flavor to winter green beans. Everyone loved them.

This is a simple, flavorful accompaniment when you don't want your vegetables stealing the show. I added more lemon than was called for and really liked the result; a zesty and flavoful side dish.

Light and zippy. I added the lemon zest of an entire lemon...not overwhelming in the least. I served it with Prime Rib and garlic mashed potatoes. Thanks!

It's a nice simple yet different dish. The lemon and rosemary give the green beans a kick. I'd do it again.

Simple and tasty. Leave the beans whole after removing end stems for more elegant presentation. A great dish for entertaining.
