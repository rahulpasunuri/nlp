Having made this twice, my recommendation is to make sure that you rinse the eggplant thoroughly after salting - the first time I made it I didn't and the salt was so overpowering that I couldn't even serve it. This time, I was careful to do a proper rinse. Yes, the eggplant color isn't beautiful, but the red peppers go a long way to brighten the dish and make it more attractive. I took the lazy way out - I bought Kvutzat Yavne red pepper strips and rinsed them before dicing and adding to the mix (I used about 1/2 the can). My guests loved this dish - the serving bowl was empty long before any other in my salad assortment. (More than one guest asked me how to make it.) It's a great recipe for any time of the year, and the bonus is that no modifications are needed to make it Kosher for Passover!

If there were more forks, I would award this recipe with 20 of them. This salad is outstanding DROP DEAD DELISH. I served it along with pickled cauliflower and Persian pickled cucumbers with Passover brust and roasted matzah dumplings.

This has become one of our regular Passover special foods. My kids look forward to it and I usually make it twice, once for the seders and once for the ending days.

Great recipe.Would not change a thing accept to put the finished salad in a cuisinart and with a few pulses definitely improve this recipe. The result became a delicoius spread to serve anytime on matzoh or crackers

I'm getting ready to make this recipe for the 3rd time. Twice for Passover it has been a huge hit. Serving to friends and family for Friday night dinner, and even people who normally are not fans of eggplant seem to like this preparation.

This is always a hit as a side or appetizer. I make it as written. Love the combo of eggplant and peppers. The trick is not to over-cook the eggplant. Leave it just a tad firm so it is not stringy.

I don't like eggplant, but everyone else who ate it absolutely LOVED it. Followed the recipe exactly, didn't need any changes. I am about to make it for the second time.
