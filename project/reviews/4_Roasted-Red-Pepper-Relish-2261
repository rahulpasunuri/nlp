I have done this recipe as written and directed and had excellent results. It is easy to have all the ingredients on hand. I almost always have roasted red peppers since I add them to lots of things from eggs to casseroles to salads to strips of the roasted red peppers with strips of canned green chiles over steaks and chicken. This is a quick easy recipe for last minute entertaining or just munching over a good movie or while sitting in the spa. Reisling goes really well with it too.. fruity flavor combined is great!

I changed this recipe just a little. I did roast my own. I used 3 different colored bell peppers. I used 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 cider vinegar. I also used agave syrup instead of honey becasuse it was what I had. We put it on steak sandwiches, which also included an optional herbed goat cheese. My in-laws loved it and I already e-mailed the recipe to her. A yummy Sunday lunch . Thanks for the ideas everyone!

Definitely use freshly roasted red peppers for this recipe. The tang of the vinegar and the sweetness of the roasted peppers makes for a wonderful topping for burgers, or as I made it some time ago - a goat cheese stuffed meatloaf topped with this relish.

Use fresh roasted red peppers instead of the jar.
