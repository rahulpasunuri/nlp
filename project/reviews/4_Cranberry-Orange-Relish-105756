We cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup and used half maple sugar and half granulated sugar. It was exceptionally good with the maple sugar- and better for the glycemic index!

This was very good - similar to the recipe on the back of the bags of cranberries, but better. That's the one where you throw the entire orange in the food processor along with the cranberries and sugar. I prefer this recipe because you don't get the bitterness from the white part of the orange, and it only takes a couple of extra minutes to remove the segments using a grapefruit knife. I left the cinnamon out, used the zest of the whole orange and added a tablespoon or two of brandy. I think I might stir some of this into a basic muffin recipe this morning to make cranberry-orange muffins. Yum!

Love this recipe!! Agree with other reviewers and left out the cinnamon - so easy, fresh and tasty!

No cinnamon, 2/3 cup sugar, cut off the ends of the orange and remove any seeds. In my standard size food processor we put half a bag of cranberries, half an orange cut into 4 sections, and half the sugar, process for 10-15 seconds, transfer to jar and repeat with remaining cranberries, orange and sugar. Perfection every time!

I made this a couple of years ago and wasn't impressed, but I think I didn't get out all the bitter white pith and membranes, and that's why. Yesterday I was very careful with the orange, plus I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a spoonful of amaretto. My family can practically eat this from a bowl. (Caveat: my normally not picky three year old did spit it out, but what can you do? Kids!)

When I was growing up, you could not pay me to eat anything cranberry because of the yucky jelly stuff in the can. I made this because my entire family loves cranberry sauce. I LOVE this! I use the zest from the entire orange and sometimes add Grand Marnier as a previous reviewer suggested...Heaven either way.

This is almost as easy as opening a can of sauce and so much better. It's sweeter than I'd assumed (definitely sweet enough to be crowd friendly, so don't be tempted to add extra sugar). I did not add the cinnamon and I zested the entire orange.

Following this recipe, I made just enough for the 2 of us to use with turkey thighs I roasted... 3 oz cranberries 1 whole clementine orange, including peel 2 TB sugar 1/2 pinch of cinnamon Blended with my stick blender.... Delicious!

Besides increasing the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup, I toss 1 to 1-1/2 cups of shelled walnuts into the food processor to boost the flavor, texture, and nutritional value.

Leave out the cinnamon and this is great. We had both whole berry cranberry sauce and this at Thanksgiving dinner this year. Both were a hit. It is great with left overs. If the orange is nice and sweet, don't increase the sugar more than the 3/4c suggested, but definitely don't add more than 1 cup. Even my four year old grandson ate this one up.

excellent relish, used mandarin oranges and zest instead of navel, increased the sugar slightly - perfect

This year I added some Amaretto and it was great! I've made the basic recipe every year for five years now, just switching which liqueur I use. Amaretto wins over Grand Marnier or Chambord. :)

The best Thanksgiving cranberry dish ever. We triple it to make sure we have a lot of leftovers.

Without the cinnamon, this is also close to my family's perennial favorite recipe. And actually, if you make this about a week or more ahead of time and jar it in the fridge till then, it tastes even better!

Used two Clementines and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. This gave it a slightly different flavor; but it is a keeper.

EXCELLENT!!! Everyone Loved this. I added a little more orange zest and it made the flavor really pop. :)

I've made it twice already and it's not even Thanksgiving yet. I'm going to freeze extra bags of cranberries while they are in season so we can enjoy the relish after the holidays.

This is a yummy start. I leave out the cinnamon and add 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier. It almost tastes like a margarita.

Except for the cinnamon, this is very similar to the kind of relish I had growing up. I think the cinnamon makes it even better.

My family has been making this recipie for as long as I can remember. It is amazing. Sometimes we use splenda instead of sugar, and we do not use cinnamon. We also use more Cranberries. This is a wonderful recipe.

Great recipe. I always get requests for the recipe. Sometimes I leave the cinnamon out. I love it both ways. Instead of using a blender I use a meat grinder because it makes the texture so nice.

One of my favorite cranberry recipes. I add the whole orange also, and sexy it up with persimmon chunks and pomegranate seeds.

My husband remembered this to be the signature dish of a favorite aunt...she cut 1/4 of the top off an orange, hollowed out the fruit, then filled it with the relish for each Thanksgiving Day guest...children and adults alike enjoy the simple and colorful presentation as well as the tastiness of the relish!

Made this wonderful relish for Thanksgiving and EVERYONE loved it. Shared this with the people at work who also LOVED this. Thank you for sharing this with us all.

I am sure this recipe is delicious just as printed and I will try it that way in the future. This time, however, I made a variation of it: I omitted the cinnamon, but used 1/2 cup chopped crystallized ginger and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger instead.(Pulsed all ingredients in the food processor as indicated.) Tangy and refreshing! Even those who aren't ginger fans enjoyed it.

Sorry, I did not like this. And I did not get the impression that most of my guests were very impressed either.

Never cared for Cranberries before this. Now I love them and this is always a hit at our table. This relish goes great with the Turkey. More of an applesauce consistency than a relish.

YUMMMMM I made this relish for Thanksgiving and now cannot get enough of it. Sometimes I add a granny smith apple. Great to eat right off a spoon!

A huge hit at Thanksgiving! I wasn't sure about an uncooked relish instead of a cooked sauce but this was fabulous! Lots of compliments and the request to have it added to our annual standards. So quick and easy too!

This is a perfect cranberry dish for the Holidays. Very similar to the one on the back of the cranberry bag, but with some great additions. I upped the sugar to 3/4 cup but 1/2, as suggested,would have been fine. Definitely use ALL of the orange for the zest. I didn't bother taking the orange sections out of the membranes. I also added about a TBSP of Grand Marnier for extra flavor. Ended up adding the cinnomon and don't regret it. A huge favorite, even amoung the diehard "jelly" fans. Will be a staple.

Fast, simple and very tasty. Resist the temptation to add extra sugar and DO use the zest from the whole orange. I doubled the recipe for 21 people and had TONS left over, so I won't double next year when I make it again.

So easy with such payoff. I add a handful of unsweetened dried coconut for an extra zing, and hold off on the cinnamon.

This is one of our favorites (along with Cranberry-Port Conserve. We make them EVERY year for Thanksgiving. We also have to serve canned cranberry jelly type for Tom but everyone else prefers these two!

Fantastic! It is so easy to make, and so delicious! My mother (who's used her mother's relish recipe for years) requested the recipe. I also used the zest from the whole orange. It will become a staple at our holiday dinners.

YUM YUM YUM. I doubled the recipe, and my beau and I still ate the entire thing. (It's hard to put the bowl down once you get started!) The tart of the orange zest makes the difference. One change: try mineola oranges instead of navels. You'll get an even more flavorful creation.

An American classic. We have always made it using a whole orange (minus the seeds)and no cinnamon. Also, this recipe works best when made with an old--fashioned meat grinder rather than a food processor. It comes out pallid in the processor (hence the zesting and de-pithing steps in this version). We like the slightly bitter undertone the pith provides, but that's personal. I would definately use the entire zest, not just 2 tsp.

This was so quick and easy but tasted like it took a lot more effort to make it. I used this recipe with Gourmet's Nov 2001 Turkey recipe that also had oranges stuffed in it. The flavors complemented each other well.

My mom has been making this relish for years (without the cinnamon). Everyone loves it and she always has to make at least 2 or 3 batches. Really good in the leftover turkey sandwiches!

Everyone loved this cranberry relish bursting with flavor. I made the relish two days ahead of Thanksgiving and chilled in refrigerator. The tastes intensified. And it is so quick and easy!

Although I haven't tried this recipe I find the addition of a sweet variety of apples and pecans add alot of umph to a cranberry relish. Just my opinion.
