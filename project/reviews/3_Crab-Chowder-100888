I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe sounded bland. I left most of the bacon in the pan, rather than removing all of it. It added the flavor needed. Also, added thinly sliced celery, minced garlic, grated parmesan cheese, and seafood stock. Used less milk due to the additional seafood stock, and also used the recommended cayenne. I'm not a fan of Old Bay even though I live in Virginia area...so didn't use it. And let it simmer a while before putting in the crab so it's thick enough. I am not a fan of thin chowder. I would definitely make this again, with the above changes.

Old Bay is not cayenne and salt. It does not contain cayenne. I suggest you try it, and read the back of the container. It is a delicious blend of spices with complex flavor.

OK, why would anyone make chowder with water and boiling potatoes? Old Bay is just a lot of Salt and cayanne, use fresh instead. I used this recipe as a jumping off point. Here is what I did: Sauteed 1/2 an onion in butter and when transparent, added finely chopped fresh sage and thyme and two chopped stalks of celery with salt and pepper to taste, then added two cloves of garlic. Cubed several pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes (they are the creamiest) and added them to the pot to sautee a few minutes before adding about 4 cups of homemade turkey broth made with just a touch of yellow curry. Bring to a boil and then turn to simmer to let the potatoes soften. When soft, take a potato masher and crush some of the potatoes to release their starch into the chowder base (serves to thicken). Added 14 oz of fresh picked Maine crabmeat and simmer before taking off heat. I made this at noon for a 7pm dinner and have placed the pot in the fridge to cool and meld flavors. Will reheat before serving. Might add either heavy cream or Sherry before serving, but perhaps not. Since I am allergic to seafood, I have to rely on everyone else to tell me how it is, but I have already gotten two thumbs up from my taster.

After reading all of the negative comments I knew I had to give it a try. Yes the chowder as the recipe reads is rather bland. You could tell that just by reading it. Some people have no imagination. A recipe is just a guide not a gospel. I doubled everything and added a few stalks of celery. Instead of the water I used chicken stock. Keep the cayenne pepper at 1/8 tsp or not at all. You must add a teaspoon Old Bay. I tried with and without and the soup needs it. Sherry is a nice addition too.

Well it needed something... like for flavor cooked the potatoes and a diced onion in chicken stock then added some old bay and cream twice the lump crab served with a tablespoon of sherry floated on the center it was excellent but honestly.... then it became my old she crab soup recipe and not the original recipe at all... oh and served with corn fritters rolled in powdered sugar... my recipe got rave reviews but this one smelled like dirty sweat socks when cooking until I made the changes... first yuck recipe I ever found here editor must have left something out.... goes well with a spinach salad too... did I mention that I crumbled bacon on top of the soup before serving.... everyone wanted more... of my version.... the true test

This would be very boring without the changes people suggested. I added celery to the onion saute and reduced some sherry in the mixture before adding the potatoes, Old Bay Seasoning and stock. I also added corn and finished it with sherry, and used twice as much crab. With these changes, the soup was excellent.

Pardon the pun, but this recipe flounders without some additions. Add to the pototatoes and onions ample fresh, diced celery. Also, towards the end of the simmering phase, throw in a large bag of frozen corn. No bacon, but a cup of strong chicken broth adds a nice flavor, too, but isn't necessary. I have used part half and half to the milk to thicken and add richness to the stock. For seasoning, I add (take your pick): fresh pepper, celery seed, and cilantro to taste. Keep the Ol' Bay Seasoning or Chef Prudhomme's Seafood Seasoning (the best!)on the table when serving. It is awesome. Don't give up; give this version a try.

YUCK! I really can't understand why this soup is so terrible. It has great ingredients. It smell like stinky feet when it's cooking. My husband even asked what the awful smell was. If I could I would have given it a big fat 0!

This soup is very good with substitutions (it is excellent the day after). I substituted baby red potatoes (with skin) for the boiling potatoes and 2 C half and half and 1 C fat free milk for the whole milk. I omitted the cayenne and added about a tablespoon of Old Bay.

This soup, prepared as instructed is bland! I poached the potatoes and onion in clam juice until soft, added milk and some light cream, then the crab and bacon. Blandsville! I then jazzed it up with alot of old bay, some aromat (salt type spice)and a touch of sherry. Helped it quite a bit. The next day this soup was out of this world! Will try again when blue crabs are in season and use the bodies to make a crab base.

It was OK, but nothing special.

I thought that this recipe was rather blan, and would recommend saving your expensive crab for the Crab and Tomato Quesadillas (which you can find on Epicurious also)! It was an okay recipe, but there are many more ways to enjoy a good crab dish!

really i would give this recipe a 3.5 if i could. this soup was very good the first day, but really great the second day - it seemed to absorb more flavor. it is also very easy to make - perfect for a quick meal.

Being raised in Maryland we have a particular palate for crab soups. I was looking for something creamy and when we made this we found a winner. With a touch of sherry when you add the water, and old bay instead of cayenne, it is nearly perfect! I will make it over and over!

My husband & I went to Carmel over the weekend and fell in love with the cab chowder at Flaherty's Oyster Bar. Although this recipe was a bit different (theirs was orange in color) it tasted very similar. I substituted with vegetarian "bacon" strips which still have the same smoked flavor as the real thing, then sauteed the onion in butter rather than bacon grease for a slightly lower fat version. Absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again soon!

I made this recipe for Christmas. It was delicous. The bacon and parsley is a must. None left over. I will definately make this again soon.

My girlfriend claims it's the best soup I've made! I used canned crab too which worked just fine. Extremely simple to make and very flexible: I added a cup of chopped fresh asparagus to the potatoes and onions about 5 minutes into their cooking time just for kicks. I can imagine a lot of other additions working well with this recipe. Yum!

Unfortunately I had to use imitation crab meat beacuse I went shopping late at night and that was all that was available. The recipe still tkurned out fine. I was delighted with the ease of preperation. I added a slice or two of crumbled bacon with the crab at the end for added flavor instead of just garnishing.I can't wait to try this one again!
