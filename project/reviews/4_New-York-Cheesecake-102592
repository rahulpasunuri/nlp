Excellent to my taste for real NY style cheesecake! Warning to watch out for the high heat to start (can burn if you follow the directions) so watch it while you wait and let out the heat when turning down to 200 deg.

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but due to the mixed reviews and results given by other cooks, felt I had to put my 2¢ in. I have an electric oven and followed the initial time and temp of 550° for 12 minutes, with the rack one notch below center. While the cake did brown around the outer few inches of the cake, I didn't find the cake was toughened or the taste was affected. The crust did get too dark in a few spots where it was sticking up higher, and thinner, than in other areas of the crust, but those dark crumbs could just be brushed off. Anyway, my only issue with the baking directions, and my reason for wanting to add my experience to the reviews, is that I too found 1 hour to be WAY too short a time. It shook like pudding after an hour. I left at 200°, but ended up baking for 2 hours 5 minutes (not including the 12 minutes at 550°). I did not open the oven after lowing the temp, and let the cake cool in the oven with the door closed. I thought longer baking at the lower temp would be better than cranking up the heat, if you don't mind waiting. All my ingredients were at room temp. Instead of using zest, I used 1 teaspoon extract for each of the fruits. The moral of the story is, patience pays off, and this was honestly the best cheesecake I or my fiance have ever tasted. My suggestion is to give this recipe a try if you are not under time constraints and will be able to watch and adjust the baking time. It's wonderful! Oh, not sure how it would have been the day of the baking, but we chilled this in the fridge overnight before digging in. And in fact we are each having another piece now...the first slice we devoured together while making breakfast. Couldn't help it:-) Try this one!!!

Not good! Followed recipe to the 't', including the baking time and temperature. The cake was very undercooked - soupy. And, I considered myself a very good baker. Unclear what happened.

I've been making this recipe for a number of years, so I would like post my notes the make it successful for me. Here they are: The INITIAL oven temperature and timing is CRITICAL. For WALL OVENS - lower initial TEMPERATURE to 525 degrees and the TIME to eight (8) minutes, then check to see if raised. Don't let top brown prior to dropping oven temperature. . . . . . . Top with fresh raspberries smashed into some raspberry jelly with a little whip cream.

I have had a version of this recipe for 20 years. I want to clarify an issue that several people are having trying to brown this at the start. The original recipe, as stated in this version, had a different crust. My version says to start at the high heat until THE CRUST browns. The cake itself will not brown in the first minutes of baking at high heat. Hopes this helps.

Just made this for an office party and feel compelled to add to the overwhelming number of reviews. Firstly, this is delicious. Not a burnt disaster, not a gloopy mess. However, there was some burning on the edges and some gloopiness in the center. Most people seemed to enjoy the cake, but some couldn't finish it, or politely scraped the gooey center part to the side of their plate (yikes!). I followed the directions practically to a T, since I have a gas oven that will go to 550. My only "modifications" were to use a pan of water on the bottom rack, cook the cake at 200 for an additional 10-15 min, let the cake cool in the oven for 15-20 minutes and then an additional hour outside the oven before cooling in the fridge. So, my advice is to take seriously some of the cooking time experiments in this review section. OR look up the cherry almond cheesecake recipe also available on epicurious. That's the one I usually make, and have never experienced burning or under-doneness. You can make it with any type of fruit topping and plain crust. Just used this one as my office mates specifically requested a plain jane cheesecake

Cheesecake came out great for me. I have a large 6 burner + griddle Vikiing Range with a gas oven. My temperature gauge only goes to 500 degrees so that is where I started and then followed the baking directions in the recipe. At 500 degrees the broiler doesn't come on in my oven. Obviously if the cakes are burning on the top the broiler is on. The only thing I changed was that I baked the cheesecake in a foil wrapped springform pan which was sitting in a larger pan filled with water. YUM!

Although I am not a Le Cordon Bleu graduate..... This recipe turned out perfect. As someone who has cooked for 42 years, I can say that baking is science and sometimes the variables of our ingredients and the equipment we use, can make a difference in the outcome. I appreciate that Epicurious gives us a place to review so that we can decide how we might want to alter the outcome.

Well, if it weren't for the 550 degree oven this would be great. The batter tasted great, but because we were cooking a large dinner we stuck it in the oven for 12 minutes at 550 and when we removed it the top was burnt. Not black, but so dark that it is crusty and will not be enjoyable by our guests. We will try it again one day, but we will watch it VERY closely every minute while at a high temp. I have been making cheesecakes for years and this is the first one that burnt...I should have realized the temp seemed way too high (compared to all others I have made).

Beautiful & delicious cheesecake. Definitely a keeper. After reading the reviews, used a microplane for lemon only zest, and used 2 teasp of vanila. Then, I adjusted the time slightly: 5 minutes at 550, 5 minutes at 500, put water in the 'catch pan' on lower rack, lowered temp to 200 for 90 minutes, then, left oven door open with oven off to cool. Top was beautiful, uniform pale brown, cheesecake perfect, rave reviews!

In a word, YUM. I varied the baking temperatures a bit - 350 for 15 minutes then back to 200 for the one hour. I cranked up my oven to the highest it would for at the end (about 550) to brown the top, watching it carefully the whole time. It turned out perfect!

The reviews here are very high or very low, prompting me to believe that there should be some sort of printed adjustment to the recipe. A recipe is a direction as to how to make a successful dish. It should have a successful outcome unless there is a minor/major error in following instructions. In my case, unfortunately, I followed the recipe to the T. The top of the cake and crust were burning - prompting me to take it out of the oven. My oven does not go to 550. The cake was not in 12 minutes before I turned the oven down, and it - was in the middle of the oven. I had to scrape the filling out of the crust, blowing the whole purpose of making the dessert in the first place. I found the filling too sweet, which is just a preference, while I liked the orange and lemon flavor. I am VERY dissapointed. (I went to Le Cordon Bleu and worked as a chef, so I know what making desserts entail).

This is my go-to recipe for no-fail cheesecake and I've adapted it in dozens of different ways over the years. It never disappoints! Just be sure to NEVER over-beat the eggs ... and an oven that's a little too slow is always better than an oven that's too hot. A water bath (or at least a pan of water below) will guarantee that the top never cracks :-) Happy Baking!

Rating: 3
My first attempt at cheesecake, and the filling came out wonderfully. However, the crust scorched black in parts. Not sure what went wrong? I followed the baking instructions to the letter, and used a springform pan. Wonder if it would have made a difference if I had put water in the pan below the cheesecake as it baked. Or maybe there's a special cheesecake baking pan? I've used my springform dozens of times before in recipes, but never taken it up to 550 deg.

This is my second review for this recipe. To the people who are complaining about the temperature and it burning - a New York Cheesecake is okay with a little brown to it. However, if you don't like that or - if what I suspect having baked this in both a gas and an electric oven - you are using an electric oven, put a piece of foil over the top to keep it from browning. This is especially important in an electric oven due to the top coils. You will want to dome the foil so it doesn't touch the surface of the cake. While it is best to leave the door closed and let it come down to 200 degrees on its own after the initial 550 degrees, it's best to open the oven anyway to make sure the cake puffs up before turning it down. I didn't do this recently and had to cook my cake longer than normal. I would also never use a non-stick pan for this. I have, and it only burns the crust. I was given a regular pan without the coating and have never burned the crust since. It's not like non-stick is needed anyway for this so just don't use it. This is truly the best cheesecake recipe, and I first cooked it based on someone's comparison to Junior's in NYC which was exactly what I was missing when I went searching for a recipe. I have made this now maybe 5 or 6 times and about to do 2 more. I have never had a negative comment. I have gotten requests, licked plates, offers to pay me for it, and sounds of ecstasy upon tasting the first bite. I have used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust. I never use the zests. I'm not really into the taste of lemon, so I simply cut it out. I have substituted almond for vanilla. I have a few other variations I am going to try as well. So, no, the 550 is NOT a typo. Follow this recipe as stated. Some ovens may require a bit more than the hour or so once down to 200, but you really shouldn't need a lot more. If you do, you may want to get an oven thermometer to check your oven's temp. And yes have everything at room temperature.

Just made this again :-) This time leaving out the zest's. This is still one of the best Cheesecakes recipes I have ever run across. I hope people will please give it a try. It's a large cake that should last awhile and so creamy and tasty. I've no choice but to give it another 4 Forks

Rating: 4
Yes it is 550 :-) for the first 12min. or until puffed. This is an outstanding cheesecake recipe. I've never tried one with SO MANY eggs it before. I followed the recipe to the letter (knowing NOT to incorporate air into the batter by over mixing and having ALL ingredients at room temp.) and have one of the creamiest and best tasting cakes I have ever made. Not one crack. But I did let it cool in the oven with the door closed then open and all that rigmarole. This is definitely a '4 forker' and I'll make it again.

550 is absolutely ridiculous. Thought it was a typo and perhaps should be 350 instead? It really got messed up and the thing was thrown out. Not sure if I'll try it again.

So my cheesecake came out fabulous although it was in the oven for a few hours! I took it out with the very slightest "giggle" still in the centre. It was not the least bit dry - smooth and creamy and very rich. The only thing I would change, as some other reviewers pointed out, is that I would omit the citrus completely and add vanilla instead. Otherwise, it was a showstopper!!

Baking this cheesecake right now. Started at 550 degrees and after about 6 minutes, I noticed some small bubbles getting quite brown. I immediately lowered it to 200 and so far so good. It smells divine and looks great. Stay tuned for the important results review :)

Fabulous!! My oven does not go up to 550 degrees, so I set it for 500 degrees, put the timer on for 8 minutes and immediately turned the oven down to 200 degrees when the timer went off. To the person whose cheesecake burned within the 8 minutes: did you have the rack in the MIDDLE of the oven and not higher? I have made this cheesecake several times and it always turns out great.

I couldn't find my old and good recipe so I thought I would try Epicurian. Well, it burned in less than 8 minutes at 550 degrees. I am so angry. Thanks for a totally awful recipe. It was a waste of expensive ingredients. I gave it one fork because I couldn't give it minus 10.

This was a huge hit at my party! I was a little skeptical with the temperature variations but followed them exactly: perfection. I did wrap my pan in foil and cooked it in a water bath. No cracks whatsoever. A perfect cheesecake! I only varied the recipe ever so slightly out of necessity rather than creativity. I had no orange on hand, so I used two lemons, and I had no graham crackers, so I used gingersnaps with yummy results.

I have made this 6 times now and it's turned out differently every time due to not being able to get the heat and time right. 550 is just way too high, at least in my kitchen. This last time I had the best luck- I preheated the oven to 500 for about 30 minutes, and then turned it down to 450 when I put the cheesecake in. Left it in at 450 for around 20 minutes and then dropped the temp to 200 for an hour and half. The only thing I would do differently at this point would be to either put the cheesecake in a water bath or put a bowl of water underneath it while it cooks to prevent cracking. Regardless, the flavor is phenomenal, don't pass this recipe up!

made this for super bowl party and it was the star of the evening. easy to make---left it in the oven longer and then turned off the oven and kept it in with the door ajar for another hour. (the top did not break). made a sweet cherry topping (used smitten kitchen recipe) and it was DECLICIOUS. can't wait to make again.

This is a pretty good recipe. The orange is very strong in it; next time I would use less orange zest and more lemon. The cooking time is way off, it takes far more time to cook which makes the crust rather tough. It says to serve at room temperature, but is much better cold.

Rating: 3
I thought this cheesecake was only so-so and so did my boyfriend. it took much longer to bake than it said, I finally had to crank it up top 350 after an hour and a half, and I think such a long cooking time made the crust, which was already only average, tough.

The INITIAL oven temperature and timing is CRITICAL. For WALL OVENS - lower initial TEMPERATURE to 525 degrees and the TIME to eight (8) minutes, then check to see if raised. Don't let top brown prior to dropping oven temperature. . . . . . Great Cheesecake. Everyone loves it. Top with fresh raspberries smashed into some raspberry jelly with a little whip cream.

The cake is cooking in the oven as I type this. The batter tasted awesome, so I don't doubt it will go over well. The only problem is that the top is too brown (I cooked it exactly as the recipe states). BUT I have a theory. I have a smaller wall oven and I SUSPECT that 550 degrees might be too hot whereas a standard oven would be more forgiving at that temperature. Next time, I will try it with a 525 degree oven.

This is the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted. But take this as a warning: it is VERY rich! A small piece will suffice! In fact, it would be great in small squares for a party. The flavor is perfect, and I have never had so many compliments on a dessert before. And it is EXTREMEMLY easy to make. A winner all around!

I have been making this every Thanksgiving for over 10 years now. It's always the star desssert - even outshines the staples like pumpkin and pecan pies. I don't like the top of the cake to be too browned, so I skip the super high baking step. I've made it in several different ovens, and the required baking temp and time are always a little different. But the recipe is pretty flexible. Even when I've "ruined" it, it's still delicious.

I've made this cheesecake numerous times now. I've found cooking it for 20 minutes on 450 and then dropping the temp to 200 for approx 2 hours seems to do the trick. The first time I made it I put it in a water bath which prevented it from cracking. It cooks just fine without it though if you don't need it to be picture perfect :)

Really rich, especially when you know what goes in it - but totally worth it. My oven doesn't actually go above 500 degrees, so I baked it at that temperature until it puffed and then dropped it to 225. I baked it under the center was just a bit jiggly and then left it in the oven (turned off) for a while before letting it cool completely. The cake was perfect. It's delicious with just the right amount of citrusy flavor (I only used the zest of 1 lemon, no orange). I played with the crust a bit and added ground pecans into it.

I have made all types of cheesecakes and I still come back to this recipe. It is easy and it should be foolproof. I don't like using a water bath but I have a pan that I fill with water when I first set the oven temp - most of the time it doesn't crack but if it does, who cares? You just cover it up with various toppings, such as strawberries and drizzles of chocolate ganache. I start off at 500 degrees until it starts to brown and then, down to 200 degrees. I also have to bake it longer than the recipe states, but, I just use the "jiggle" test, and it turns out perfectly.

C'est Magnifique. I did not find this recipe hard at all, in fact it was one of the easier recipe's I've tried. As one person has put it already, this cheesecake is perfection. I followed the instructions to a 'T' and the cake was perfect. Best I've had!!

INCREDIBLE!!! I made this last night, and I have to say it tastes just like heaven.I covered the top with home made mango preserve and had same slices of fresh mango on top, I also mixed in a teeny weeny bit of cinnamon sugar in the crumb. Also, I added some sour cream to the cheese mixture, because it was too sweet for my liking. I also baked it at about 300 degrees after the first 15 minutes of 550. It lifted perfectly, I had no cracks whatsoever (I did use a second pan filled with water to have humidity) and it set beautifully. Next time I will go lighter on the orange zest, but otherwise it's a fantastic recipe, and an unforgettable taste!

As an American diplomat, I find it important to serve authentic American cuisine-- in all its wonderful diversity-- to my guests from the host country where I live. This cheesecake is the genuine article, the gold standard, a thing of beauty...and so delicious! Not wanting to risk a burnt top after other reader comments, I started it at 450, but finished as directed. I found the crack added to its hominess. Since i'm in South Africa, I covered the top with a layer of seasonal fresh mango, cut in ribbons, and tossed with a hint of lime juice. Fresh berries would be a good complement, but I would serve them on the side.

Rating: 3
The only thing I omitted from this was the orange zest. I followed the temperature instructions and added approximately 20 minutes as the center did not set completely. This cheesecake tasted pretty good, but I had a major problem I had with these recipe (as some other people did) was the cracking of the top and the center didn't set completely when the outer portion started to over cook. In the end it the cheesecake had a range of texture denser on the outside to not completely set in the center. Next time I would bake this in a water bath so that it cooks more evenly.

DO NOT BAKE THIS CHEESECAKE at 200 degres as stated or you will get a mess like I did. After I took the cheesecake out of the oven the center look like it was done, it wasn't shaking. I followed the instruction to place the cheesecake in the refrigerator. Thinking that the cheesecake was done I poured a cherry filling on top. After I cut a slice, the middle of the cheesecake was soft and running, and the crumb piecrust was soggy. I had to cut half of the slice away and ate the part that was solid. I start doing researching on other cheesecake receipe and the normal baking range is 350 to 375 degrees NOT 200 degrees for a hour. I will be using a cheesecake recipe from another site that I had used before which came out PERFECT!

Best cheesecake ever! It lasts for several days, too - I just polished off the last piece - still going strong at 7 days! I used 3 packages of regular cream cheese and 2 packages of reduced fat CC and it was perfect. I think any richer would have been too much. I also adjusted the oven temps and times, like many other reviewers - in my case, 10 minutes at 500 and then 1.5 hours at 200 (kept the door shut the whole time - except when I was checking on it). Perfect!! I'll make this again and again!

Rating: 4
If you alter this recipe you are messing with perfection! Stop with trying to change the cooking temp, reflavor it or reduce the sugar! First, start with your ingredients at room temperature. The 550° starting temperature is necessary in order to give the cheesecake some lift, which gives it a lighter consistency. No water bath is needed! Use the center rack of the oven and WATCH THE CAKE for those first ten minutes. If it browns enough before 10 minutes has passed, REDUCE THE HEAT down to the 200° temp that the recipe gives, WITHOUT OPENING THE OVEN!! There's no excuse for burning a cheesecake like this! Your diligent efforts will be rewarded with the most fantastic cheesecake that you've ever made!

i left out the orange nd lemon zest,put in 2 tsp of vanilla, everything else i left alone.

I made this recipe twice and it was delicious. I cooked it for 8 minutes at 475 then 3 minutes at 525 then, then without opening the oven, reduced the temperature to 200. I skipped the orange and lemon zest for my husband who likes his cheesecake plain. The crust is YUMMY!!! The only thing is that it did take over an hour and a half to cook the cake.

This cheesecake is crazy good. I am throwing my other recipes out. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because, like other bakers commented, the 550 starting temp nearly incinerated the top off my cheesecake. I might try 475-ish next time. Also I agree the crust is a wee bit too sweet and firm for my taste. Might try only 3 TBSP sugar next time instead of 1/3 cup. Overall, really delicious flavor and great texture.

Everything was perfect except I undercooked it a little... But, even the slightly gooey middle portion was yummy. The lemon/orange zest provided a delicate citrusy flavor. I also only added 1 1/2 cup of sugar, which was MORE than enough.

Well, this was somewhat diaappointing! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and ended up with burned cheesecake! I preheated my oven to 550 degrees (my oven was tested so I know the temperature is accurate). I put the cheescake in the oven and after 10 minutes the top was dark brown, and almost black. The graham cracker crust was burned and black. I quickly put foil on the top and turned the oven down to 200. I cooked it for 1 hour. The inside was cooked perfectly and the cheesecake tasted very good. It just wasn't pretty... so I was embarrassed bringing it to the Easter dinner that I made it for. We picked off as much of the black crust as possible, and heaped fresh strawberries on top to cover the ugly brown top, and around the sides to cover where we picked of what we could of the black crust. The cheesecake is actually very very good, and I will definately make it again, but will not cook it at 550 degrees as the recipe says. Mine was cooked perfectly on the inside and was not raw as some reported. The cheesecake puffed up nicely too, and was very thick. Just make sure you watch it closely adjusting your oven as needed!

Amazing! this was my first time making a cheesecake and the results were phenomenal. A real NY cheesecake. I didn't have any issues with the time and cooked it exactly as the recipe said. I didn't open the oven and made sure to cook it on the bottom rack and it was perfect. In place of a spring form pan I used a disposable foil pan and cut out the edges once it cooled. Definitely making this one again.

I made this on Thursday for a Saturday party and it was excellent. I was making a lemon cheesecake for the party as well, so I left out the lemon and orange zest and added 2t vanilla instead. Baked it at 475 for about 8 minutes then bumped it up to 550 for about 3, then down to 200 for the hour. I was afraid of burning it, based on other reviewers comments, but this worked. I've made many cheesecakes but my husband (a huge cheesecake fan) says this one is the best yet.

I made this cheesecake a few months ago and was very excited to taste it. Well, I think I made a ditzy mistake. I used the zest of an entire lemon and an entire orange - The texture of the cake was disgusting - The taste was fabulous but the texture was like eating hair. I'm having the same friend over tomorrow for dinner and I'm going to retry the cake with 1 tbls of zest each. I had no problem with the heat of the oven but I also cooked it in a water bath. I'll keep you posted!

This was my second attempt at chese cake and it was a disaster. I put the cheesecake in my oven at 550 and by 8 minutes it was burning. It never poofed up like the recipe mentioned.The edges of the crust were black and there were brown spots on the top. I quickly turned the heat down to 200 and set the timer for an hour. The top was coninuing to brown so I put a sheet of foil on top of it. I took it out after an hour. The center was still jiggley but the recipe said that was ok. Today we tried to cut into it. I picked off the black part on the crust. I sliced into it and the crust was rock hard. The edges were slightly burnt and the center gooey and not fully cooked! The flavor was good but the cake hideous. Any advice?

Made this at the request of an 80 year-old transplanted New Yorker for his birthday celebration, and it was both beautiful and delicious. Took other commenters advise about the starting temperature. Set it to 450, and gave it about 10 minutes. Then down to 200, but for much longer than the 1 hour specified (electric oven.) Cooked for 1 hr 45 min, then turned off oven and left cheesecake in the oven to cool. After 30 min. cooling time with door closed, I propped door open slightly I continued cooling for about another 30-40 min. One tiny crack, and cake was perfectly set. Re: the zest, I think its imperitive to use a microplane rather than a conventional zester or a knife. That way, you get the essence of fresh citrus flavor, but no unpleasant texture. Fresh sliced strawberries piled on top, then a light glaze of melted strawberry jelly (not preserves). This was the quinitessential New York cheesecake. Thanks, Epicurious!

I chose this recipe based on another reviewer who compared it Junior's in NYC and made it for a friend as a gift. The cheesecake is perfect! I don't like fruit flavors in my cheesecake so I cut the zests and used only the vanilla. I also used 3 low fat bricks of cream cheese and 2 regular. You wouldn't know the difference. So far as cooking, I followed the recipe to the letter and used advice from a cooking show. I had no problem cooking it at 550 for 12 minutes (gas oven). Also, when you turn it down to 200, do NOT open the door. Let it come down to 200 on its own. That's how it only takes an hour to cook. It is very jiggly when you take it out. Don't worry about that. It does continue cooking once it's out of the oven and then sets up perfectly in the refrigerator. Next time I am going to try it with almond extract. And my friend licked the plate clean - really.

great cheesecake recipe. make sure you do not cook at it 500. it started to brown prior to 12 minutes even when i set it for 6 minutes on 600, 6 on 475. i'll try 400 next time, that seems to make more sense to me...

Absolutely delicious! Creamy & rich tasting. The orange and lemon zests give it a nice slight tangy taste. I used Splenda Blend for Baking to help cut down on the calories (every little bit helps). It got rave reviews on Christmas Eve. I served with strawberries and whipped cream (not that it needed any help).

I made this last weekend, and it isthe best cheesecake I have ever had! So creamy. After reading the other reviews, i decided to bake it for six minutes at 500 and six minutes at 475, before lowering it to 200. I baked it an hour, and the outside was a tad overdone. Still creamy and delicious (and VERY rich). I used vanilla cookies instead of graham crackers, and omitted the sugar in the crust (the cookies were sweet enough). It was perfect. I also only used 1 1/4 cups sugar in the batter, instead of 1 3/4 cups. Next time I think I might reduce it to 1 cup -it's plenty sweet! I also might try substituting some low-fat cream cheese for the cream cheese, to make it a little less rich.

I entered the previous review of 7/21/08. This cheesecake, in spite of the crater like cracks was fabulous! The following day, as another reviewer already mentioned was even better. After slicing the cheesecake, the cracks were not visable, especially after topping with fresh strawberries. Perhaps the reason mine cracked so horribly was that I used low-fat cream cheese? Anyway, still a huge success as far as flavor and texture.

This was my first cheesecake. It is extremely easy to make. The temperature was way to high for my oven. I did 5 minutes at 500, 6 min. at 475 ( I literally watched it bake at this higher temp based on others reviews that it burned) and then down to 200 for 92 minutes. I think its really a judgement call as everyones oven cooks a little differently. No cracking, just a perfect cheesecake. The crust turned out great too.I would highly recommend this!

My goodness. I have never enjoyed a more delicious cheese cake than this. It has the most perfectly delicate yet firm consistency, and such lovely flavor. We serve it at our parties and often times we find guests getting into it before they've even finished their main meal!

My staple recipe! Increase the bake time, as everyone else indicates. Also, bake it at least 1-2 days ahead of time because the texture and flavors improve over time. Day 1 it is only "okay". Day 2 it is pretty good. Day 3 it is to die for (but usually nearly gone)!!

I made this for the first time yesterday and I will definitely make it again! However, like many of the reviewers who altered the cooking time, I will have to do the same. The top was black from the 550 at 12 minutes! I was really disappointed but I peeled off the charred part and it was fabulous tasting.

Rating: 4
Per other reviewers, I went light on the lemon and orange zest. Also cooked it for extra 30 minutes. Let it sit in the fridge for 3 days. When I served it you wouldn't believe the response from guests. Best cheesecake they had ever eaten. Even people who didn't like cheesecake, loved it. Had to convince everyone it was homemade by showing them the springform pan! Fabulous recipe.

I made my first cheesecake with this recipe and it came out perfect. A few alterations: (1) I accidently left the cake in for about a half hour longer. Those reviewers who say the cooking time is too low, I agree. (2) I used Nancy's cultured cream cheese. I hate citrusy cream chesse, and Nancy's was perfect for keeping a little tartness. Also Nancy's helped a lot with the smoothness as I (3) handmixed. (4) I think the crust came out a little too thin. The second time I added about a third more which was better.

Had to cook a little longer (10 minutes) than was called for. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly and it was wonderful. Served at a baby shower and came out perfectly.

This is a great tasting cheesecake and easy but the cooking temp/time seems to be off. I followed the directions and mine came out undercooked. Even after letting it set over night in the frige its still very soft inside. I'll try again but adjust the cooking time. Very good though.

550 is TOO HIGH!! That may work in a high-capacity bakery oven, but not in a home oven. And baking at 350 with a water bath does not a New York Cheesecake make! Those reviewers are cheating!! :) 12 minutes at 550 nearly charred the top of my cake. I will say that the taste was divine, though a bit too citrusy for some folks. Here in Cali we got big oranges, and I should have been cautious about that. I would suggest starting at 450 and watching it until it's the beautiful golden brown a New York Cheesecake deserves. And I would suggest to Epicurious that the recipe specify the amount of zest to use, not the number of fruit. In any case, done right, this is a very creamy cheesecake. Despite having to cover the top of mine with fruit, I received plenty of genuine compliments.

I've made many cheesecakes in my day but thia is the best! I went with another reviewer and baked cake with listed ingredients but baked in a water bath at 350 for 1 1/4 hours with 15 minutes in oven with heat off. Perfect!

Good solid cheesecake recipe. Used a microplaner zester and got lots of flavor. Only potential issue for me was textural because of the zest (lots of bits throughout the cake) Nobody else at the dinner party had a problem with it though. Perhaps next time I'll try to figure out a way to grind it down further.

Rating: 4
I think this is the best damn cheescake I have ever tasted, & I don't say that lightly. I made a crust of crushed almonds, walnuts, pecans, & graham crackers. The combination of this rich nuttiness with the zesty citrus of the filling left nothing to be desired. If you don't have a mixer, as is my state in life, do not fear... I whipped it all my hand & it was still delightfully light & creamy. I'll stop writing though it is truly difficult for me to cease on the merits of this dessert.

Not sure about this. Followed this recipe to a 'T'. Plus added a water pan to the bottom of the oven. Cooked it at 500 degrees for 12 minutes, til it puffed, then reduced the heat and cooked for an hour and 15 minutes. The top had some nice dark spots on top. Removed it from the oven - cooled it for two hours on a rack then put it inthe fridge for 8 hours. Pulled it at at midnight for a late nite indulgance - had a fresh blueberry sauce ready to go. Cut into it, pulled out a slice. It was like pudding inside. What up? Where's the dense cheesecake? Sucks! Put the slice back in the cake and preheated the oven to 250. Going to continue cooking it for another hour. We'll see. It seemed a bit too citrusy too.

Rating: 3
I used 3 packages of 1/3 less fat cream cheese (and it was still plenty rich), zest from only 1/4 of both the lemon and orange, raw sugar in the crust for extra crunch, and baked in a water bath. Cooled in oven to reduce the cracks (still got a few little ones). Forgot the vanilla and it was still terrific. Will absolutely make again. Very easy too.

I used the ingredients in this recipe but used Emeril Lagasse's baking instructions for his NY cheesecake from FoodNetwork.com ie. , using a water bath and a temp of 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. The top of the cake did brown but did not burn. It turned out beautifully and of course it tasted good too. Now back to low-fat foods...got'a balance things out.

Made this for my annual holiday party for 50 people. My good friend who knows that I cook everything for the party asked me where I bought the cheesecake because it was so good. Even my mother-in-law asked me for the recipe because she thought that "it was better than hers." Thanks for all the great notes/advise - made it with the shortbread crust as recommended. I topped it with fresh blackberries and a homemade blackberry glaze that perfectly balanced the sweetness of the cake. The best cheesecake recipe.

I made this for a co-workers birthday in June and she thought it was incredible - one of my best. I have to say I did make a couple additions - I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust and added 1/3 cup of cream to the batter. I baked the crust for 10 min at 350 to make it a little crisp. And I did my usual water bath but at 300 for an hour and then cool down in the oven. I topped my slice w/ carmel sauce (store bought ice cream topping) and it was terrific - picking up the hint of cinnamon in the crust.

This was absolutely delicious. Rich, dense, creamy. Divine. I believe this was the best cheesecake I have ever made. Sometimes the New York style baked cheesecakes can be a bit dry. This recipe is mouth watering with the right balance of citrus. I made this for my book club, when we read The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion. The book takes place in New York so this dessert was perfect!

This cheesecake was excellent. My oven overheats, so the top browned rather quickly. That notwithstanding, it turned out exactly as I hoped - dense but creamy with subtle lemon and orange notes. Made it for my boyfriend's birthday.

to make this is in smaller pans just make the filling and crust as usual..Do the same procedures but put them in smaller pans/ serving containers. The only thing that will be affected is the baking time. Less surface area to heat= less bake time. Theres no way to tell you the time without ever making this or knowing what size of pan you will use.. but you could use small spring molds or even the rammeckins used for creme brulee'. If you use several smaller dishes/pans be sure you fill them as evenly as possible for even baking.. You will have to keep an eye on them because the bake time is: when they're done. No set time just eye it.. They will set just like the bigger cake.. I use creme brulee dishes filled about 2/3-3/4 the way up to leave room for a topping. Plus everyone has their own individual serving. I always bake cheesecake in a water bath to keep the sides from over-cooking

This was my first cheesecake - it was fabulous. I cooked it at 550 for 8 min then had to turn down to 200 (oven door open)as it was browning fast. I then cooked it for 1 hour. We did find the center to be more like thick pudding, so I probably should have cooked it a bit longer - or possibly chilled it longer?. I also cooked it with a convection oven. Thanks to the cook that recommended cooling the cheesecake in the oven. I had a beautiful cake with no crack - my first cheesecake! Thanks for all the great tips!

this is the quintessential n.y. cheesecake recipe--it's creamy and smooth, balanced by the crunchy crust (i would add a bit less sugar to the crust recipe). this recipe was adapted from a commercial kitchen, so the baking method and time always varies. follow the directions people have offered below--they're incredibly helpful. having a gas, electric, or convection oven makes all the difference in the way you cook the cheesecake (electric ovens will definitely burn the top). i too cooked my cheesecake for 2 hours in a gas oven (even if i cooked it too long, it still was perfect).

I am not quite sure about this recipe. I just took it out of the oven and it looks like the graham cracker crust is scorched! Someone had talked about a "water bath", but it wasn't in the recipe that was printed. I baked it for an hour, and it seems to be done, but the top is dark (had to cover it with foil before I turned it down to 200 degrees) and the crust looks totally burned. I will have to let you know how it is when it's cut open. Darn! I love N.Y. Cheesecake!

This is a recipe as close as I can find to a traditional, dense, thick cheesecake...so what if it has a little flour. I have made this dozens of times...all to rave reviews. I usually omit the zests completely. I like the wonderful smell and flavor of the zest, but I hate how the texture zest spoils that smooth creamy-cheese feeling in your mouth...for me, eating cheesecake is not just flavor, but also savoring the texture, not just chomping it down. I dont think I would spoil it by using some artificial lemon or orange flavoring, though. Has anyone tried natural citrus oils? Too bitter? I do skip using a water bath...mostly because of laziness! I do shorten the "hot" time and watch it so it doesn't get too dark, usually using foil. I sometimes get a crack, but I don't present it as a whole cake, only in slices, so I don't fret about correcting my method much..plus I sometimes get to eat the first piece to get rid of the crack! My family prefers it plain, or with a little topping (thawed, frozen strawberries packed in sugar syrup that have been smashed a little with the handheld blender...told you I was lazy!...but it appears to guests that I am a tedious, slaving cook with this great cake!)

This is one of the best cheesecake recipes that i have come across in a long time. My family insists i make it every year and for the topping I like to glaze strawberrys or raspberrys in a heated jam or jelly. it gives them a nice shine and they look stunning on top.

this was my first time baking anything and it didn't dissapoint. in fact, i was shocked that it turned out to be so great. i followed the 12minute 500degree/2hour 200degree baking method and the cheesecake came out nice and creamy. unfortunately during the last 30minutes the cake cracked.(can anyone tell me what might be the problem) i wasn't sure if the recipe called for 7 total yolks and 5 whites; and i even accidently mixed in half a tablespoon of salt in the filling,but i still ended up with a scrumptious cake. my family even compared it to "the cheesecake factory." haha... i guess im gonna have to make this cake again

I just made this cake for a friends Thanksgiving night party and WOW... I think it is the best cheesecake recipe I ever come arcoss. I did as other suggested and didn't heat the oven initially as hot as recomended or as long. I did 500 degrees at 10 minutes then went down to the suggested temp for the remaining baketime. Also I used the convection setting on my oven which yielded a perfect golden top. I plan on making three more for a big New Years party. I can highly suggest this recipe!

I have made this cake MANY times. This is my son's absolute favourite and the rest of the family likes it too. What I like is that is serves a large group (perfect for family gatherings) and is a great plain cheesecake that you can finish any way you like...I've tried strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and even chocolate sauce. Make sure you double foil so no water gets in. It also freezes very well so you can make a whole recipe and freeze half for a later time. If you half the recipe you can bake it in a 8 inch pan and adjust the baking time.

I didn't have such good luck with this recipe and will try another one next time I go to make a cheesecake. Mine burned despite lowering the temp to 525, then I used a water bath for 2 hours at 200 which cooked it but left the crust soggy, a problem I've never had with other cheesecake recipes. Finally, I halved the citrus zests but it still came out tasting awfully strong...

This recipe is absolutely incredible!! This is the first time I have ever baked a cheesecake and it turned out absolutely perfect. It was for my husband's birthday and he just loved it. He said that it tasted like one of those big expensive cheesecakes you buy online or at a specialty store. Talk about a compliment!! I'll be making it for Christmas dinner. All the hints and ideas were a tremendous help. I read all the reviews before baking. The only hint I would add is for gas ovens, bake it for 2 1/2 hours @ 200F. At 2 hours the majority of the cheesecake was still jiggly, so I added another half hour and it turned out perfect, no burns, no cracks no nothing, just perfection!! I used a 10" springform pan and had to double the graham cracker crust recipe. Also, another tip is to lightly spray the sides and bottom of the pan with a cooking spray and use a paper towel to make sure the pan is evenly coated and your cheesecake will pull away perfectly while cooking. I had no problems getting the sides or bottom off. I have a feeling I will be making this cheesecake quite often!! this recipe definitely deserves way more than 4 forks!!

the best ny cheesecake ever tasted (and ever made)!!!! even juniors cheesecake, which i used to buy whenever I went back to visit in ny, does not even compare!!! but i have a couple of pointers!!! the recipe given here is for those who have gas ovens, because the first 12 minutes that i baked it at 500 degrees, it burnt on the top!!! for electric ovens you need to bake at 450 degrees for 8-10 minutes,reduce heat to 200 degrees and bake for one hour. but the first 30 minutes (baking under 200 degrees) you should check on it!!! other than that, the cheesecake deserves 10 forks!!!!

Very tasty and traditional- better than any other cheesecake I've made. Liked the orange and lemon zest. I substituted 2 low-fat cream cheese packages for the regular, but no one could tell the difference as it was still very rich. I served it at a bridal shower and everyone LOVED it! HINT: The baking time on this recipe is totally off. I used a 9" pan and baked it for 10 min. at 500 degrees. Then, (following another reviewer's advice) I turned the temp. down to 200 degrees and opened the oven door till the temp. dropped. Then I baked at 200 degrees for approximately 2 1/2 hours! It needed MUCH more than just 1 hour at 200 degrees as the recipe instructed.

A wonderful cheesecake. Perfect texture and easy to prepare. The citrus flavor was surprisingly subtle. Would be inclined to add more zest to it next time. Used a combination of ginger snaps and graham crackers for the crust. My oven is a small gas oven, so next time will lower the initial temperature to 475-500 degrees for less than 12 minutes.

After reading all the great reviews of this cheesecake I was expecting something fabulous. However when I made this for my brother's birthday, it was quite a let down. It was so bad my mom asked if she could throw the rest of her piece away. But I did alter the recipe somewhat so that could possibly be why the dissapointment. I tried to make this low carb by substituting the sugar with splenda. Maybe I'll try this one again with real sugar next time.

This is a great cheesecake. The slow baking technique is wonderful and it's very rich and creamy. One warning, I did bake it in an unfamiliar oven last week and the top turned BLACK very quickly. When doing the hot-baking technique, make sure to keep your eye on it (the good news is we peeled the black part off easily, turned the oven down and finished baking it and it was delicious).

TRY THIS... I've had perfect luck each time. Preheat oven to a full 500* have oven rack set slightly lower than center. Have your springform pan double wraped in foil.(not over the top) Bake 12 minutes then open oven door and watch as temp drops to 200* don't just turn oven down without letting heat out right away. bake for 3 hours! no-kidding. I get a perfect textured cake all the way through. I've made dozens with this recipe and technique. I only change the flavors.

Due to fears of burning, I only baked it at 475 degrees for 12 mins. This lead to a slightly soggy crust and only the beginnings of the caramel flavour. I may cut down on the butter in the crust a little next time and go with the slightly higher temp. The filling was delicious although I had several large fissures on the surface. May go back to the waterbath method as well.

I brought this to my boyfriend's grandmother's Hanukkah party last weekend (first time I'd made it, first time I'd met them). Everyone loved it (yay!) and his grandma's student even asked me for the recipe. The only problem was it looked like it was dropped -- the night before we watched with dismay as the height kept sinking as it cooled. Also had a little crack on top and was a little darker than I'd have liked. However, it TASTED fantastic, and that's the most important part. We skipped the vanilla and added ~ 1/8 cup Cointreau to enhance the citrus flavors. Also baked at 500F for the first 12 minutes, and for only about 50 minutes after turning it down.

Wonderful! I'm an American living in Germany and I made this cake to give the Germans a little taste of America. They loved it, they have never tasted anything so good before. I had people telling me how this cake was better then their old German grandmothers cakes that they grew up eating. I almost felt bad for destoying Ommi`s (grandma's) image. Wonderful! However, after the tenth or so piece (not in a row, over time) the Germans complained that it was too sweet, so maybe next time I wont use so much sugar...or maybe I'll just not let them eat it anymore. I guess their pallets just aren't as advanced as ours. Welcome to America.

Relatively easy and absolutely delicious cheesecake recipe. I made a couple of alterations--made an almond graham cracker crust (found that recipe with the key lime cheesecake recipe on this site) and cooked the whole thing in a large pie pan (no springform pan). I also followed a suggestion in the reviews that you cool the cheesecake in the over with the door slightly ajar and I didn't get a single crack in the top. Delicious, especially served with the strawberry vin santo sauce on this site.

This is the best New York style cheesecake recipe I have made. My entire family loved it. It was moist and delicious. I used a 9" springform pan and baked it for 10 min. at 500 degrees and then about 1 1/2 hours at 200 degrees. Absolutely perfect. I wish I could rate it with 10 forks!

I was looking for a good, basic, cheesecake that could be served with fresh berries for a summer dessert. This was great!

This recipe is really outstanding. When I served it, no one even spoke! They all just made happy sounds. I didn't have any of the problems of the other reviewers. I wasn't sure how dark the top should get, so when it started to look like it might get darker than I'd like, I covered it with foil. I served it with the fall fruit compote, which was very nice. But I think this could be eaten alone, too. It is super rich--many more than 8-10 servings!

This recipe is superb. I have been making this recipe since I got the Good Housekeeping Illustrated cookbook in the 80's which the filling ingredients are EXACT (except for a different crust and cooking time) for the "deluxe Cheesecake".

This recipe worked well for me in a low-carb version (Splenda instead of sugar, Atkins Bake Mix instead of flour, and a pecan crust). I used the foil to avoid a burning top, but left it on too long - I actually had to turn on the broiler for a minute to get a little browning on the top. I also extended the bake time for about 30 minutes. The texture was perfect but the crust was overdone. Next time I'll use a water bath.

I have made this cake 4 times and got raves every time. The first 3 efforts did have cracks on top but I was told that's to be expected. I have now been instructed by a lovely young lady expert who told me that my cakes cooled down too quickly. She said to do the following, and I did -- with perfect results. After baking, shut the oven and leave the cake in the oven with the door slightly ajar, and don't remove it until the inside of the oven cools to room temp. This slow cooling prevents cracking.

The first time I made this cake it was not cooked enough even though I used a 10" pan and cooked it for 1 and 1/2 hours and left it in the oven to cool. The second time I made it I used a 9" pan and cooked it for 1 and 1/2 hours at 300, not 200. It came out perfect the second time.

Got all my ingredients together and realised that I'd left my large cake tin at someone's house, so had to split the recipe over two cake tins ... cooked in the hour easily because of smaller amounts. When cooking at the higher temperature I let it only just start to colour before turning the temperature down, this meant it nicely browned throughout the rest of the cooking. If I can cook this in my tempermental old oven ... anyone can!! Absolutely delicious, my mum thanked me for going to her favourite shop and buying it for her ... then I told her that I had made it!

I have made this cheesecake several times - each time for a different group - and it has always been such a hit! I make two changes: 1) use the orange zest only, and 2) put foil over the cheesecake when baking on 550, otherwise it gets a little too brown on top.

I have made this cake for the second time and it was awesome. My husband, who has a critism for pretty much everything I cook, said that "there was absolutely nothing wrong with this dessert." He ate 3 slices and won't allow me to take in the leftover to my office. I made the crust with ginger snaps, and everyone loved it. It think ginger goes very well with the citrus zests (which are essential to the cake, IMO). This also makes a great base for other fruit toppings. Yummm.

Delicious, but there must be a typo in the "bake one hour at 200 degrees" requirement--not nearly enough time. Wish I'd read all of the reviews first. I used another crust recipe but otherwise made no changes. I will make this again but will bake it longer and will cover the top after 45 min. as it browns quickly.

I have to agree with O-M-G from Stamford. This was truly awsome!!! This was my first attempt at a real cheesecake as opposed to the boxed kind. It was not that difficult and I followed several recommendations - 7 pkgs. of cream cheese instead of 5 and being conscious of choles., etc. I used 5 1/3 less fat and 2 regular, baked at 500 for 15 min. and 1 1/2 hrs at 200 (have a gas stove if that makes a difference). I served it with a pineapple sauce made with crushed pineapple and a pre-made blackberry sauce (pineapple went better). This was our Easter dessert and it has been requested for next year also!

This cheesecake was delicious. It was very thick and even a little was satisfying. It was easy to make too! The lemon and orange gave it that extra little touch.

Our family was raving to have more evey second.

I've never tasted a better cheesecake and I've spent some years living in NY! I added two changes to the make it a little better. First I made sure that I didn't have the crust too thick. First time I made this, the crust tasted burned, although the cake just appeared done when I took it out of the oven. Definately don't overdue the time on this cake. That's how I got the "burned taste". Secondly, I added some canned cherry topping, to just add something special to it. Enjoy it, just as I have and many of my guests!

This is an excellent recipe and has been around the internet food websites for quite a while. I have made this cake 6 times and have found thru trial and error that 7 packages of cream cheese makes a better texture cake. Be sure that you mince the lemon and orange zest instead of leaving in short strips. I believe the one hour at 200 degrees is a mistake. The actual cooking time at 200 degrees (after the 12 minutes at 550) should be one hour and 40 minutes (this in a temperature calibrated Viking Oven). Also be sure to use the freshest, best quality butter you can find for the crust. I used some old butter once and the crust cooked up as hard as a brick. It is difficult to restrain yourself from mixing flavorings into the batter, but a real New York Cheesecake is flavored only with the fruit zest. However, you can knock yourself out on any toppings added later after cooking.

This was my first baked cheese cake & it came out perfect! I read ALL of the reviews before starting and got lots of good tips about baking time. I baked for about 8 minutes at 500 and then 1 hr 20min at 200, but still a little jiggly. I then took the cake out of the oven & brought the temp. back up to 500. I put it back in the oven for 2 more minutes (watching closely), which seemed to solidify the cake a little better and gave it a nice browning on top. Used gingersnaps for the crust, easy recipe - yummy!!

i made this recipe twice, to be sure it wasn't a mistake the first time. Expensive compared to other cheesecakes I've made successfully, and this one burnt black on top in the first few minutes (top had to be scraped off for serving!) and then collapsed and cracked.

Delicious recipe. However, I do three things differently. One, I use 7 packages of cream cheese instead of 5, Two, I bake for 1 and 1/2 hours instead of just 1 hour, and Three, I age it for 2 - 3 days in the refrigerator before serving.........The closest thing to real NY cheesecake, slightly dry, and crumbly....

This is an excellent recipe, but of course, as with any other, you'll have to tweak it to suit your oven and taste. I cut the sugar to one cup, thrown teddy grahams into the electric grinder (and listen to the lil' bears scream...), squeeze the lemon and orange juice into the cake as well, otherwise they'd be wasted, and for my oven, find i have to keep it in for abt 2 1/2 hours. a little time consuming, perhaps, but on the whole, not all that difficult to make, just have to watch out when browning. four forks, two thumbs up, and lots of artery-clogging goodness!

Perfect texture! I scaled the recipe down to 3 pkg cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, 2 teas flour, 3 eggs, 1 yolk, the rinds and vanilla, also added 2 tble sour cream and 2 teas lemon juice, baked at 500 for 6 min, and 200 until, not jiggly, with my oven it took 1 hr.

After years of making every type of cheesecake but the good old New York cheesecake, I decided to try this recipe. It is fluffy and firm and very rich and tasty. I was sceptical about the 550 degrees but I needed not fear! This cheesecake turned out wonderfully. I used the pecan crust recipe from the Pumpkin Cheesecake With Bourbon Sour Cream Topping recipe. Truly wonderful and highly recommended!!

This was a delicious and very easy recipe. For those on a wheat free diet, I substituted rice flour for the 3T of flour and the texture did not change. This one will be included in our family's wheat free cookbook(with a pecan/almond paste crust). Enjoy!

I've made thousands of cheesecakes over the span of my culinary career and I traveled both stateside and abroad. Believe me when I say that this cheesecake,is worthy of the title New York Cheesecake. A hint to the wise, start checking the cake for "puffiness" right around the 5-8 minute mark during the initial (550 temp) baking period.

The time on this cheesecake ie. 10 hours is definitely a typo. I thought it strange but tried it anyway. It still turned out great even if it was a little overcooked. I made mine fluffier by beating the eggs separately. I also added 2 capfuls of Limecello liquor and one lemon zest. Yummm! I also used 1.5kg package of cheese instead of 5 X 8oz. Works out to be about one more package of cream cheese. This is the best cheesecake I've eaten, and so says my Cheesecake freak gourmet cook boyfriend. Easy recipe.

I made this for my co-workers and it was gone in a flash. This recipe has lots of flavor and the sugar in the crust makes it sooo good. I didn't have a zest of a lemon so I substituted it with an 1/8th of a tsp. of lemon extract. I also backed the temp. down to 500 degrees and it browned nicely. This is a keeper!

Rating: 4
OH...MY...GOD...Yes, this was just as good as everyone says, and really not hard to make. I used the reviewer's variation without the zests, but with the sour cream and lemon juice (to avoid zest bits spoiling the smooth texture) and also used the reviewers' process that called for 500 degrees for 10 mins., 200 degrees for the remainder, oven open for a bit to hasten the cooling. Even though nothing was really "wobbly" when I took it out, I still wished I'd left it in a bit longer to solidify more, but that's really a matter of personal taste. With so much emphasis on low fat cooking, I felt like one of the witches in Macbeth stirring my cauldron of poison as I beat the cream cheese, eggs. yolks and sour cream--this is a once-a-year treat, unless you want to do away with your husband. Keep in mind that this is a very large cake, and most people will be sated with a small slice, so it really serves a big crowd.

Great finished product - nice flavor and texture. Just made it for the second time. First time I made it I followed the recipe's instructions and ended up with an over-done top. This time I followed the recommendations of other reviewers by lowering the initial temp to 500 and time at 500 to 10 minutes. Not overdone this time, but it took forever at 200 to get done - more like an hour and a half than the hour that many others had suggested. Oh well, the taste is still worth the wait (I'm sure it was my oven). I will definitely make this recipe again! (I am taking it to Thanksgiving, I hope it is as big of a hit with the extended family as it is with my immediate family!)

Rating: 3
I agree with the temperature comments below. Also, I had a fear of the bitterness from the zests so I added a capful of Cointreau in the filling and in the cherry topping I made and it really made it unique and tasty. I was also thinking of substituting some of the cream cheese with mascarpone. Any thoughts?

Rating: 3
I've made this cheesecake on several occasions. If you are making a cheesecake to eat alone or with a topping and want the consistancy of real cheese then this is the recipe for you. The only changes that I've performed to this recipe is to eliminate the orange zest and only use about 1/2 of the lemon zest called for in the recipe. I have made another crust and substituted a pecan sandie cookie crust and it was excellent. If you use a cookie based recipe crust be sure to place your springform pan on a baking sheet as the cookies tend to be oily and will leak. I highly recommend this recipe for a tall, dense, delicious cheesecake.

Definitely the best cheesecake recipe I've ever come across. Would make again for any occasion - elegant and delicious. We made it for a lunch party and it was a big hit. I added 1/3 cup sour cream and 1 tbsp lemon juice (along with the orange and lemon zest). I baked it for exactly 10mins on 500 and then around 1 1/2 hours on 200 as other users have suggested and it was perfect. I also opened the oven door for about 10mins to cool it down after turning the temp down though, I think this is important to stop it from browning any more. Didn't use a bain-marie and we had no problems with cracking. One note on the base, we had to make twice the amount to have enough.

Tasted great but did not firm up properly in the middle. Very frustrating! I followed the cooking directions to a 'T' but added a pan of water on the lower rack to help with cracking... Was too brown to continue cooking... Unsure what the problem could have been.

Finally! This is THE cheesecake recipe! Although I won't be turning my nose up at the moister, creamier cheesecakes, this is the New York-style Cheesecake I've been looking for.

I have even substituted the recipe for this crust for a Oreo Cookie crust and used quatered Oreos inside the Cheesecake omitting the orange and lemon zest doing it this way !

I highly recommend this to anyone that is a Cheesecake lover !!

Absolutely delicious! I did, however, run into problems with cracking and the outside edge of my crust got too done. I followed everyone's advice for 500 degrees 10 min. 200 until done. I ended taking mine out after exactly an hour. I'm thinking I may open the door to let a little of the heat out after the first ten minutes, as my edges cracked after I changed it to 200. Maybe it took long for my oven to cool down after the 500. In any case, it was delicious enough to try again!

Well the reason i dont like this specific recipe is because i feel that cheesecake(the fine cake it is) should not 10 hours. after cooking for 10 hours are you really in the mood to eat the cheesecake? No your not! Thats why i cheat and buy the book that takes 45 minutes not 10 hours! sincerely cheesecake basher!

I looked up the original recipe in the 91 issue.I did follow the 500 degree suggestion. The crust was a little tricky to make, but it was for a friend's birthday, and well worth it. When my company ate it, all they could do was sigh, they enjoyed it so much. After my guests saying they had never had any better, I would definately make it again.

First of all. It is very easy to avoid the huge crack that occurs in homemade cheesecakes. The secret is to cook to an internal temperature of 150 degrees. I cooked this recipe deleting the zests, adding 1 Tbs lemon juice, 1/3 cup sour cream, cooking for 10 minutes at 500 degree oven, then cooking at 1hour and thirty five minutes at 200 degrees. It is great!

My first shot at a cheesecake and it came out wonderful. I wish I had followed the advice on the reviews though, as at 550 after 10 minutes it was already pretty browned(good thing I checked)!

I haven't made this New York cheesecake yet, but I have made many, many other cheesecakes. I just wanted to say I have been really enjoying the different feed back from all the reviews. So many of you have great ideas for toppings. I wouldn't have try cranberry topping only because milk and cranberries are so horrible when eaten together. Good suggestion. If you are a frist time cheesecake maker don't be afraid to try it. Be careful not to over mix as that will cause it to crack. Make the night before you wish to serve it as cheesecake should be cooled as slowly as possible. Thanks for all the good ideas. ~Naomi

"STUNNING" was my husband's comment for this amazing cheesecake. I made it for Christmas and there was NONE left. I agree with other reviews: zest of 1/2 lemon and 1/2 orange and also added 1/3 cup sour cream which was a big plus! Baked as reviewers suggested: 500F for 10 min, and aobut 1 hour 50 min at 200F. Also used grahmam cracker crust on box. The cake was fabulous. Will make again this weekend to bring to a friends dinner party.

Absolutely delicious!! I made this for my friends birthday party and everyone just couldnt get enough of it! I cut down on the orange and lemon peel (about one half to three quarters the amount that the recipe calls for). I used the crumb crust recipe with prepared crushed graham crackers and it worked very well. I served the cheesecake with milk chocolate covered strawberries and homemade whipped cream. I used the leftover chocolate to make a syrup (I added milk and cream in a double boiler) to go on top of the cake. This desert is terrific!!!

I have made this cheesecake for four years for thanksgiving. Everyone loves it and I add nutmeg and cinnamon I also add some lemon and orange juice. It gives it a fall taste with the spices and a light fluffy taste with the citrius juices together. Wonderful! It is my favorite holiday tradition.

I made this recipe once before and everyone who had some said it was the best cheesecake they've ever had. And it was my first attempt at a cheesecake, ever. I recommend making another graham cracker crust than the one listed. I did this the first time I made the recipe, one that required baking the crust to harden it, and I think it came out better. I recommend buying the graham cracker crumbs instead of crushing them yourself, as it's one of the most time-consuming parts of the recipe.

Wonderful! A cheesecake purist's dream. I added the slightest amount of salt to the crust(a pinch as opposed to what the recipe calls for) and I believe the zests, as called for, ARE the cheesecake. Also, one hour 15 minutes got the job done at 200 in my oven.

The only cheesecake I used to use was the "Stumptown Cheesecake" from Gourmet many years ago, but have lost the recipe. Thanks to all the rave reviews, I have a new favorite! I followed the suggestions - (but made the crust from the recipe on the back of the graham cracker box). I added 1/3 cup of cream and decreased the zest to 1/2 lemon and 1/2 orange. The baking suggestions were great - 500 degrees for 12 minutes and then 200 degrees for two hours (and didn't open the oven once). Perfect - no cracks, creamy. Just wonderful. It really is foolproof it cooked that way.

Used several of the hints in the reviews and it worked perfectly...even though it was my first time making a cheesecake and the first time baking in my electric stove! I used the 500 degree oven for 12 minutes then the 200 degrees. I decreased significantly the zest (no orange and 1 teaspoon of lemon) and tripled the vanilla. I also added sour cream (approx. 1/3 cup) and cooked it in a 9-inch springform on a baking sheet in a waterbath. I decreased the sugar in the crust and eliminated the salt. I also loosely covered the cake with some tin-foil when it got to the color I wanted. It still took about two hours at 200 degrees to cook even with the covering. It was a huge hit with the people at the potluck! Thanks for all the hints.

I originally got this receipe from another cook book.

This is an extremely easy and delicious cheesecake recipe! Similar to other readers - I was glad I read the reviews prior to trying this recipe (i.e., use less salt in the crust, only bake at 500 F, etc).

Unbelievable! This is an amazingly delicious cheesecake; one of the best, if not THE best I've ever eaten. I'm glad I followed the advice of the other reviewers. I baked it at 500 degrees for the first 9 or 10 minutes and then at 200 degrees for slightly under 2 hours. The only changes I made were as follow: I put half the amount of sugar in the crust (3 Tbsp.), and no salt at all. Also, I added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the batter as the final ingredient. The cheesecake came out deliciously creamy with a taste beyond compare. A king of cheesecakes!

I topped this wonderful cheesecake with a fresh lemon filling and candied lemon rind. It made a beautiful presentation for a resent birthday. My friends praised it highly and are asking for another.

I would definitely make this again but with a few changes. I followed the advice from the other reviews and changed the baking time (10 minutes) at 500., then 2 hours at 200. It got way too brown, almost burnt (I have an electric oven). I almost didn't bring this to my friend, who I had made it for, but figured I'd risk it. I covered up the extra brown top with some fresh kiwis and some pretty flowers and gave it a go. Well, everyone raved. When I make this again but will reduce the temp of the oven even further and keep a watchful eye. Quite yummy, though.

This is, quite simply, the best cheesecake in the world---even without my additions and subtractions: I use 6 packages of cream cheese, 1 large T. finely grated lemon rind, 1.5 tsps. finely grated orange rind, 1.5 tsps. of vanilla and no salt. With a gas range, I bake at 500 for ten minutes and reduce heat to 200 for two more hours. Top with freshly sliced strawberries and a spring of mint.

Wonderful recipe! I also baked it at 500 for the first 12 minutes and another 2 hours at 200.

This recipe is fantastic!However, through trial and error, and after the crust burning at the initial 550, I now bake the cheesecake for 9-10 minutes at 500 degrees, and then 2 hours at 200 degrees.

I recently tried alternating the mixture with raspberry puree, and it turned out great! Excellent!

This cheesecake is perfect if you just make the following 3 adjustments to the cheesecake and crumb-crust recipes: Use only 1/8 tsp of salt in the crust, bake the cake at 500 degrees for the first 12 mins, then reduce heat to 200 degrees for 2 hours. Don't open the oven door during the entire bake time. Perfect!

Excellent recipe -- the citrus flavor complements the cheesecake very well. I had to make it twice because the first time was a total flop. The crust was too salty and the cake didn't cook long enough (only 1 hr 15 min) and didn't set up properly. The second time around I added only half the salt in the crust. Also, I reduced the initial oven temp to 500 degrees and then baked at 200 degrees for 2 hours. It was perfect! I highly recommend this recipe -- following the suggestions above.

Nice citrus flavor, the way it should be. Dense and creamy, no fluff here,it wouldn't be a New York cheesecake. I would be careful however with the 550 degree cooking temp, the only thing I cook away from my restaurant at that temp is pizza. I added 15 more minutes to the bake time for dry out. .

I really liked the taste of this cheesecake, and I followed the suggestions of baking it for less time at the high temperature so it wouldn't burn. My problem was that it didn't set completely.

The taste was great, but you really have to watch it carefully the first 12 minutes when it's baking at 550 degrees. The top turned too brown too fast and by the time it was finished after baking at 200 degrees, it almost looks like it was burnt.

Excellent, very creamy. Will definitly do it again.
