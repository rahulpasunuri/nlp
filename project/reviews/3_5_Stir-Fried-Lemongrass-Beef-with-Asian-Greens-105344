The marinade in this dish is really excellent. Like some other reviewers, I used flank steak, slice in long strips. I omitted the mustard greens, doubled the bok choy, and added rice stick noodles. I soaked the stick noodles until soft, and added them and the greens to the pan with the steak, stirring until the noodles were cooked as well. It was very nice. Also, I didn't have any peanut oil, and subbed half sesame oil and half vegetable oil, which came out quite nice.

Made almost exactly as written except using pork and i cooked the greens mixture for a minute or two and also stir-friend some fresh udon noodles to make it a full meal. stir fry meat, remove, leaving liquid in pan, stir fry noodles, remove, stir fry veggies, then recombine all in pan. delicious!

Great flavors. We had to substitute for the Nam Pla fish sauce and we used little gem lettuce and young spinach instead of the Asian greens. Delicious. My wife was disappointed that the dish was not spicier despite the full TBS of chillies... We'll definitely be making this again, though we may dial up the chillies a bit.

This dish was excellent. A new favorite, and I'm a bit picky. I wonder what happened with the folks who didn't like it. I couldn't even tell there was fish sauce in it. So, my minor adaptations... I didn't have lemongrass, so I substitute 1-2 teaspoons of fresh minced ginger (good to add anyway I would say) and a splash of lemon juice to the marinade. I made the dressing as directed but used a mix of sesame and canola oil instead of peanut and went heavy on the shallots. I used a bit less red onion in the salad part. I was worried about not cooking the greens at all, so I stir-fried the onion, basil and greens for about a minute, then added the dressing and meat as directed. I think you can really use whatever hardy greens you have, and I think you can generally use whatever cut of meat you have so long as you slice it thin. This was a terrific tasting meal and was all homegrown for me save the oil and fish sauce.

Loved the marinate for the beef. I used grass fed beef flank steak and left it in the marinate all day and it came out great. I used chili garlic sauce instead of pepper. I also would leave out the mustard greens and double the boy choy and add mushrooms next time. Also cooked the onions first, then beef and finally wilted the greens- added the sauce just long enough to get warm it came out great that way.

Too fishy, too salty! We were not pleased with this dish. I would cut down the fish sauce to solve the fishiness and saltiness problems, and up the sugar a bit for more flavor contrast. Don't think I'd make it again as there are so many better recipes around.

This was quite good. I didn't have sirlion on hand so I mixed all the marinating ing. with ground free-range beef. Made them into meatballs and sauteed them. They came out quite tasty. I didn't like how crunchy the lemon grass was though in contrast to the meatballs. The dipping sause really made it though. Served the with rice and sauteed bok choi.

My wife and I have made this dish more frequently than any other from this site. We love spicy foods, and this one is incredibly unique and tasty. We use extra lime.

I've made this dish regularly since I found it in Bon Appetit in 2001. It always gets rave reviews and there's never any leftovers. I skip the red onions and use only bok choy, shredded red cabbage and regular basil for the salad. Everything must be fresh though--especially the lime juice & lemongrass. Served with bowls of sticky rice its a really flavorful, refreshing meal.

Followed advice from another reviewer and used a few extra limes (also good for tenderizing the meat), cut back on the soy sauce, tasted and adjusted until I was happy with the saltiness. Could not find opal basil, so I used about half a cup of torn sweet basil leaves. End result was delicious.

WAY TOO SALTY! Also, this dish would benefit from a strong citrus note, and the three tablespoons of lime juice somehow didn't provide it. The salad was great, but it was overkill on the onions and then shallots in the dressing as well. Sounded good, just didn't turn out so well.

I've made this dish several times, and often find myself craving it. It works fine with ordinary flank steak from the Chinese market. The chilis make it very spicy- so watch out if you're sensitive to hot food. The most important ingredient is the lemongrass- don't skip it!

This was an easy, great tasting salad. I did use the opal basil and it made a difference. However I only used everyday salad greens. Everyone loved it.

This was so simple to do and had so much flavor. I even left out the basil and it was still delicious!! I made it with some friends and we all loved it.
