I'm not a gourmet but I had cod and asparagus and thought I would try. The cod was delicious...my 4 and 6 year olds thought so too (..this is sooo good). We thought the marinade amount was too generous given the amount of fish listed in the recipe...we used the same amount for 1.25 lbs of cod and had a lot (maybe cut in half?)- we served with rice and used very little of the marinade..the fish was very sweet given the Mirin. Yummy! On the asparagus, we subbed a balsmic dressing for just oil...was good.
