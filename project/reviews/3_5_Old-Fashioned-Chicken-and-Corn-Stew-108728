I love this recipe! I usually add peas and always top with store bought puffed pastry. Into the oven and voila! a chicken pot pie! Yum!!! Everyone loves it!

This is a nice guideline for chicken stew. Used tons of onion, carrot & celery and no potatoes or corn. The thyme, garlic and cream was just perfect! Oh yeah, I used a quart of chicken broth and no water, and doubled the butter/flour accordingly.

this is great, tasty and easy. added more garlic. coated chicken with a mixture of garlic powder, pepper and salt and then sauteed. added carrots. that's it. wonderful.

Fantastic recipe. I didn't skin the potatoes. I used dry thyme. After browning the chicken in a skillet, I threw everything into a slow cooker. Then I refrigerated and reheated it the next night. Great flavor.

My family did enjoy this recipe, and aside from using frozen corn and added 4 garlic cloves I followed the recipe to a T. We had to season it a lot more. Still a great recipe for a cold night, I'll just know in the future to up my salt and pepper and even more garlic.

also...my pan was REALLY brown after the onions, so I did deglaze it w/ a little stock before adding flour.

Make this. It is simple, delicious, holds beautifully and really quick. I also used frozen corn, dried thyme, all chicken stock and only thighs. I made it early, so it rested for 4/5 hours before reheating to serve. I did use cream,added during the reheat, but I wouldn't again...it didn't add enough to the flavor for the fat and calories. It IS similar in taste to pot pie interior- updated.

My first chicken stew! Used extra garlic, fingerling potatoes, canned corn and added carrots and peas. I also used broth instead of the water and may try the water next time as this was a tad too salty for me. Delicious, easy to make and perfect for a chilly night!

My husband and I loved this recipe. Used fresh thyme from the garden and stripped the corn kernels from 2 farmer's market corn-on-the cob. Added just one cut-up carrot (used a roll cut) and a splash of sherry. The thyme really makes this recipie special, and the little bit of cream is a splurge.

This was an awesome recipe! Very tasty, fast, and easy! I used frozen corn instead of corn on the cob and I added carrots. I also used three chicken breasts and boiled them and then pulled the chicken. It was easier than using a whole chicken.

This was OK. Very simple, reminded me of peasant food. Mine needed more salt. Was also sort of dull color-wise, though that was to be expected based on the ingredients. Wouldn't serve it to company but it was fine for my husband and I. Tasted like the inside of a chicken pot pie.

Exceptionally easy and pleasing to families with less adventurous palates. To make even easier, use rotisserie chicken and frozen corn. I skipped water and added carrots, white mushrooms, scallions and cannelini beans. I will definitely make this again!

Loved this! I didn't feel like messing around with ears of corn so I just used frozen kernel corn. I also skipped the cream. Other than that, I followed the recipe almost exactly. Can't wait to try skinnyboy's pot pie suggestion.

Ok. This was really too easy. I added some celery with the onion (red) and garlic (a lot), and I like the flavor but not the actual bits of it, so I would probably skip celery next time. I also put some carrots in, which was great. (I forgot the mushrooms I'd planned on.) I used a grocery rotisserie chicken, and a lot of extra broth. Probably about a box and a half (the big ones). I couldn't decide whether to use frozen corn or canned after reading the reviews, so I put in a 2 cup package of frozen and also a can. I think the canned is actually crisper. I also did some white wine right after the flour and that was a good idea; it adds a nice depth. My potatoes are pure mush, but I don't care too terribly much, because I am ok with mush. I should've waited till later to put them in, or just not cooked it as much, but I sort of had to since I had to add a flour slurry to thicken it up after I put all the extra broth in. I think that covers it. As simple as it was, the broth is to die for (with a lot of s+p and a few shakes of cayenne). I would probably go a little heavier on the thyme next time too. And oh yes, there will be a next time. Tonight I am going to make biscuits like another reviewer suggested to do a little pot pie, and freeze the rest. Yum happy day. It took probably less than an hour with all the chopping and break to put on a bandaid (carrot-shopping casualty) and dismembering the chicken and everything. It was totally fun to make.

This stew was super easy, fast, and delicious. I deboned the chicken but left the skin on. I used frozen corn kernels not the whole ears.

Rating: 3
This truly is "delicious." Warm and filling. The fresh thyme is key to the subtle aroma of comfort. I followed the recipe exactly except that I reduced the amount of chicken to better suit my family, and I omitted the cream. The soup is plenty rich without it. Note: cutting frozen ears of corn into 1" pieces is nigh on impossible. Use kernel corn or slice fresh ears.

Rating: 3
Very delicious! I used a whole cut up chicken on the bone, cut into small pieces, and the gelatin from the bones made the broth very thick and tasty. Also used fresh corn and just chicken broth, no water. I'll be serving the leftovers (not many!) over rice and veggies tonight.

Rating: 3
this was very good. I grated about 1/2 of a potato and the rest of the potatoes left chopped to help thicken based on some of the reviews. I used oregano instead of thyme and added 1tsp of cumin. i also added some chopped spinach but next time would add peas instead. finally, i replaced one potato with a sweet potato for colour.

Very nice. We made this stew one cold, snowy Sunday afternoon in PA. Used some pulled chicken and homemade chicken broth leftover from a roaster the day before, tossed in a bit of saffron and fresh thyme. Served with leftover cornbread, split and toasted in the oven, then buttered. Everyone loved it. There were no leftovers. Next time I'll try braising some thighs as suggested in the recipe to add to the mix. I'll bet that will taste even better!

Rating: 3
Used frozen nibblets, fresh fingerlings. Got rave reviews on this one with a couple of tweaks. 1. Made it the night before and then let it simmer for a couple of hours before I served. Thickened up nicely and the flavors really worked. 2. Added ground cumin and didn't scrimp on salt. Definitely a must. I'm a novice cook and when I first tasted this I thought it was a disaster-- very bland and just looked wrong. 24 hours later I had a real stew and a winner on my hands.

Rating: 4
Superb! I couldn't resist making a few changes, namely deglazing the pan after the flour with a little white wine, and using all broth, no water. Oh, and I only had thighs and canned corn so used those. It probably didn't need the cream, even though I used a small amount. I had one bowl of this, and couldn't resist putting the rest under a fluffy biscuit crust with a few carrots and some frozen peas to make such a great pot pie. It's like it was made for pot pie, I don't need any other recipe for it now, that's for sure, I could barely keep myself from eating the whole thing! Really tasty as made, and it does improve with resting. Best kind of comfort food.

Very filling and great taste! Goes very well with cornbread. The only thing I think it could use to make it a one-pot meal is more vegetables. Next time I'm going to throw in spinach or zucchini. It is going to become a staple recipe in this house now, though.

This is like a stew from Colombia called Ajiaco. You use oregano instead of thyme, grate in 1 potato for thickness in addition to adding some cut up. Serve it with sliced avocados, capers and cream passed at the table. The capers adds the needed spice.

Very very good. I used dried Thyme, and I did put the cream in it, but you don't have to. It is just as good without. I used all thigh meat. Next time I'll use a combination of thigh and breast.

Because I had already stewed a chicken, I had to make a few changes; namely I cut the chicken off the bone (leaving them in large pieces) and I used frozen sweet corn. It was delicious. My teenage son, who doesn't like soup, ate it all.

This is one of my favourite recipes for snowy, cold days. It is so good to sit in front of the fire with a great big bowl and some fresh bread. I make it with frozen niblets, as we freeze our left over corn all summer long. The kids are not so thrilled with it, but we love it. I will often double it for left overs that are even better the next day.

This is the very definition of comfort food, and one of the best things about it is that you can throw in whatever you have on hand and it will probably still be tasty! I used bnls sknls breast, extra garlic and broth (no water), dried thyme, celery and a small bag of frozen mixed veggies. My son is allergic to milk, so I skipped the cream and added extra flour to the roux and it worked well. With some fresh crusty bread (lots of carbs - we don't do Atkins here), it was yummy last night and even better as leftovers today!

This was a great weekday meal served with a nice salad. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it and especially loved the leftovers. A great fall dish. I did as others and omitted water,used extra broth and added carrots. Would add pepper flakes as others suggested and perhaps some thick cooked bacon bits so add some girth to it for the hubby! But was great as is too!

Excellent recipe. Serves 4-5 as main course. Used rotisserie chicken breast chopped, 1 lge potato chopped, 1 lge red onion diced, 2 lge garlic cloves pressed, 1 Tbsp minced fresh thyme, 3 c. regular-sodium chicken broth (no water), 2 c. frozen corn, 1/4 c. heavy cream, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/4 c. Sauterne wine. I sauteed the onion in olive oil until it began to carmelize (which added more depth to flavor) then added garlic and thyme. Also, right before serving, I stirred in 1 Tbsp. butter. My husband said end result was "perfect". Next time, however, to try to improve "perfect", I plan to use fresh corn, 1 c. additional chicken broth, and may add 1 c. frozen peas & carrots for color and extra flavor.

This will be a constant in our household. I doubled recipe which served five people with very little leftovers. Suggest recipe too skimpy for six people.

This recipe is definitely a staple -- I wish I had found it sooner! If you think it is boring or bland, just play with it. Use a rotisserie chicken for ease. Saute onions and garlic, then add diced carrots, potatoes, red pepper flakes (yes!) and thyme (fresh is preferable, but no big deal). Add some white wine; allow to cook for a few minutes. Then add chicken broth (I use Swanson's, and I used a lot more than recommended). When it comes to a slow boil, throw in 3-4 ears of fresh corn. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the corn is tender. Remove the corn. Allow the vegetables to cook until tender. Then add the corn (cut from the cobs), chicken (shredded or cubed), cream, and salt and pepper to taste. If you would like it more like a stew than a soup, remove some of the potatoes and broth, puree in a blender, and return to the pot. Absolutely delicious, and it takes barely more than 20 minutes to prepare.

I was cleaning out the freezer. Un-earthed some long frozen chicken breasts and (*g* several) bags of frozen corn. Turned to Epicurious to try and turn these into something edible (even had fresh thyme-in-the-box that I didn't want to go to waste.) I thought that the recipe sounded a bit bland, but it was a triple threat! As the cook from Virginia said this was "way more than the sum of its parts." I didn't add any additional ingredients or spices. Quick. Delicious! Easy (except for the cleaning-out-the-freezer part.)

Yum. Tasty chowder; I added carrots and celery and used all chicken broth instead of broth and water. I'll try shrimp next time, or maybe fish instead of the chicken. Nice winter supper for family.

Rating: 3
This is such a wonderful stew, my family loves it. I use two or three fresh ears of corn and about 2 cups of frozen peas. I also use one 14-1/2 can of chicken broth and do not use the flour at all since the cream gives it the richness and the right creaminess as it cooks down. Instead of adding potatoes into the stew, I serve it over mashed potatoes flecked with parsley (or roasted garlic mashed potatoes). It needs generous seasoning with salt and pepper. I made it for company on a very cold night at it got rave reviews!

I added extra garlic, carrots, celery, peas, and used canned corn with the juice. I also added a LOT more thyme (fresh) than was called for and used leftover chicken from chicken soup. I shredded the chicken in at the end since it was already cooked. I also subbed soy creamer and white wine for the water and it was thick and delicious. It came out more like stew than soup and my husband raved. I'm making it again tonight!

This recipe is all it promises to be, which is why I gave it four forks. Easy and quick and what a flavorful result (well, I did almost triple the garlic and add a good amount of paprika). I used a can of corn (including the liquid) as corn on the cob is $1 an ear here and not easy to come by right now! Also added a bunch of greenbeans, which were both pretty and tasty, and used whole milk instead of cream. My kids just loved it all, especially the creamy, thick broth, so next time I'll increase the liquid and spices. This one is a winner!

This is great!! Sweet, creamy, and filling. I added a tiny bit of cider vinegar and jalapeno tabasco sauce to give it a little kick. LOTS of pepper and thyme, too. It was great! Creamy and rich. I don't like big onion chunks, so I just diced my onion into very tiny bits. Classifying 4 forks as "a dish beyond compare" is a little over the top, but I will certainly be making this again. Doesn't take too long, doesn't cost too much, and it makes a great big pot of soup to use for leftovers. Yum!

I was worried about this one being bland, so I followed the previous comments and used a lot of garlic, paprika, salt and pepper. I hated this dish. Way too bland and boring. My husband, who is not as picky, rated it a B- or a C+. I will definitely not make it again.

Very simple and easy, I disagree that it is bland...salt and pepper in between steps (then add more pepper,) use a best guess on the thyme, and it turns out super. The corn makes it very sweet (canned with juices) so bear it in mind. The heavy cream is very important, I think, otherwise it would be very watery. Definitely will make again for its ease and comfort food quality.

Per previous reviews, added celery, carrots,tripled the garlic and used half-and-half. Instead of putting in the potatoes, served over mashed potatoes. It was good, but not great. I think we're just used to 'tastier' (Asian, middle-eastern) food, but if you like things simple this would work -- just be generous with the salt-n-pepper! Probably won't make this one again.

For a working mom and dad, this stew was so quick and easy....and very delicious. I used a can of corn instead of corn on the cob and I spiced up the chicken with ground red pepper, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Other than that I followed the recipe verbatim and the stew turned out perfect. It's also good with fresh cut tomatoes, cilantro and peppers on the side.

Definitely a hearty meal for a crisp day. I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of starch, either the corn or the potatoes could be scaled back a bit. Did add some carrots and celery for some additional nutritional value. The broth was fantastic!

This stew is much better than the sum of its parts! It really hits the spot. I usually add more thyme and some frozen lima beans, and I use frozen corn OFF the cob in the cooler months. I've also added sausage in with the chicken, seafood, roasted red peppers. This stew is just fantastic!

In Columbia this dish is served with fresh cilantro, drained capers, sliced avocado and cream at the table. Also, you add 1 grated potato to the broth to thicken it and you shred the chicken and return to pot. If using water, add 2 Knorr chicken bullion cubes. These additions will make it more flavorful.

Made this last night after reading varied reviews--glad I did! Used 2 cups frozen corn & 1 cup frozen peas (will try lima beans next time vs. peas), used bulging 1/4 tsp. of ground thyme vs. fresh. Following idea of previous reviewer I omitted potatoes from the stew and served it with/over mashed potatoes, WOW--YUM! Will make this again and again. Season as you go (salt & pepper chicken before browning, again when sauteeing onions, again after adding chicken and cream) and all will be well with the world.

I think this stew is very comforting - great for those cool Sunday night comfort meals. It is very easy and worth the small amount of effort to make. Salt and pepper it thoroughly.

i really liked this chowder- i added about three handfuls of spinach and about a tablespoon of fresh parsley right at the end- adds a bit of a fresher taste, a little color, and certainly some nutrition. i used just a little more thyme than called for as well and i think it added to the flavor. i found the chicken a little bit tough prepared as described- i will try poaching it next time, i think, but i definitely will try it again.

This was absolutely delicious -- the corn made it wonderfully sweet. I heeded the advice of Jeff and Glenn as I made it and cut the kernels from three fresh ears of corn and added about 2 cups of frozen peas. I used one full 14-oz can of chicken broth and eliminated the water and the flour. By eliminating those ingredients the addition of the cream quickly brought the dish to the desired consistency when simmered. Also, I used dried thyme instead of fresh and it was absolutely fine. I will definitely make this again, but next time I may completely eliminate the potatoes from the recipe and serve the dish over mashed potatoes instead. Great recipe, worth trying!
