Very good. Used only 1/2 of the hot pepper sauce.

I had high hopes for this but it was just okay (that's not to say it was bad)in our book. I used reduced fat sharp cheddar and didn't have a problem with it clumping.

It is quick and easy, and healthy! The Creamed Corn gives it almost a chowder-soup taste. I added Chicken for my husband to make it a little more filling! But very good!

I'm on a soft food diet recovering from jaw surgery. made a lot of changes to this recipe (left out celery, used red potatoes and onions instead. pulsed them after dicing. used a 16 oz. bag of carrots instead of 10 oz packages of corn and mixed veggies, used pepper flakes instead of hot sauce). turned out rather well. and was easy going down without having to chew

Great Soup. Made for the first time tonight and I'm already looking forward to leftovers for lunch. I made it exactly as written. Had no problem with the cheese which was an extra sharp New York Cheddar. I didn't really like the parsley on top and will leave off in the future. I served it with small roast beef sandwiches on whole wheat french bread. An overall very satisfying meal.

To solve the cheddar cheese issue, I laddled the soup into oven-safe crocks, added a piece of garlic toast, and last baked the cheddar on top of the soup and bread. It turned out great!

I've made a variety of cheese soups and always have problems with it curdling, even when added off the heat just before serving. As much as i hate to admit, Velveeta would be a better idea for using in soups.

The soup was a wonderful, warming main dish, espescially to vegetarians like me. I thought adding the cheese is a mandatory step, though it did gloop at the bottom of the pot a bit. Still a great recipe!

Wonderful tasting soup but I encountered problems with the consistency. The cheese did not melt evenly - it glopped up on the bottom of the pan and on the spoon, despite removing from the heat and stirring a lot. Cheese issues aside, the flavor was great and I will probably make this again, but next time I will avoid using cheddar and try a different type of cheese.

Very good, hit the spot just right.

PRETTY GOOD, CONSIDERING HOW EASY IT IS. HOWEVER, MY 2 YEAR OLD SPIT IT RIGHT OUT. I WOULD SUGGEST OMITTING OR REDUCING THE THYME IF YOU WANT SMALL CHILDREN TO EAT IT.

Wonderful! I added a little more hot sauce to give it a better kick and a mish-mosh of spices for fun. Instead of the "mixed veggies", I used broccoli, peppers, and some asian veggies which gave it a little more flair. Try it!

Served this after bingo to 60 people and everyone raved about it. Many asked for the recipe

Definitely a keeper. With some fresh bread, it was a whole meal. Perfect for one of our cold winter nights. I didn't make any adjustments...followed the recipe exactly as it's written.

I thought this soup was very tasty and not as heavy as expected with all that cheese. I added some chopped leftover ham, which really enhanced the flavor. Bacon, chicken, or even shrimp might be good additions too. It's perfect for a cold winter night!
