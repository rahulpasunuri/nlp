easy and yummy.

Easy recipe, I did it by hand with a pastry cutter. I used 2% milk and half whole wheat flour so I didn't cut the liquid like others suggested. I used the dill and it was pretty mild, next time I will add more. Also added garlic and extra cheese. Next time I will add a little more salt-personal preference!

A quick and easy recipe with great results. I omitted the dill and substituted sour cream for yogurt, as well as substituting an ounce of Parmesan instead of Cheddar. The Parmesan makes a difference!

I, like a previous reviewer, am a bigger fan of chives than dill, so I used them instead both times I made these. Results were really delicious both times, but I had a hard time getting the right texture. Next time i will cut back a bit on butter I think. I mixed them by hand (no food processor on hand) and it was fine. I agreed they needed salt, but tasted plenty salty enough after a day of rest. And a word if you need more than the 12 biscuits this makes: make 2 separate batches instead of trying to increase the amounts; the second time I made these I changed the quantities to make 18. The numbers worked out, but the dough was so sticky it was hard to handle, whereas the dough from the single batch was fine.

Yum! I used 2% greek yogurt, 2% milk (and overall a little less liquid, as suggested by others), and dried dill... they were light, perfectly seasoned, and now they're all gone.

I tweaked this recipe a bit....i added a 1/4 teaspoon each of garlic powder, ground black pepper, and dried musturd powder. Since I did'nt have any dill I used 2 tablespoons of finely chopped green onions instead. I had salted butter so I just added a pinch of salt. Also instead of using a food processer I made it by hand just like any other biscuit recipe.

Well, this is annoying because I already wrote it but I had to enter my info about ten times so someone could put me on mailing lists for stuff I don't want to get. So now my comment was lost. Anyway, these were really good. I did not have yogurt or sour cream so I substituted goat cheese which I mixed with skim milk to achieve the right volume (3/4 plus 1/3 cup) using a five oz.package of goat cheese. It worked really well, so I am feeling a bit smug. Also, I used about 1 cup of cheddar cheese or a bit more.

PS: If you factor in the work of putting the food processor into the dishwasher, this recipe is more easily made by hand. Rub the cold butter into the flour with your fingers, and then cut the yogurt and cream in with 2 butter knives. Enjoy! Oh yeah. I used salted butter and threw in a few pinches of salt...

I'd give this 4 stars if it didn't seem as though every bite was hastening my death. Decadent. Using suggestions of other reviewers, I decreased the total amount of liquid to 1/2 cup sour cream (not yogurt) and 1/4c cream (not milk.) Increased cheese to about a cup, and coupled that with about 6T chopped chives (not dill). OK, so I guess I made cheddar-chive cream biscuits, not this recipe. But boy, they're delicious--a great biscuit!

I just took these biscuits out of the oven and tasted one. They are delicious! I used sour cream instead of yogurt, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Next time I would use more salt and garlic.

I just took these biscuits out of the oven and tried one. They are delicious! My batch were not overly doughy, but were nice and soft. Next time, I think I will add some garlic and a touch more salt.

Just had these with a rustic sausage and kale soup. These are delicious biscuits. I made them a little smaller than called for and they were perfect. BTW...they are wonderful with cabernet!

needed more salt. i halved recipe 2 fit in food processor. used whole wheat and AP flour. also subbed fresh basil for dill. mostly all yogurt, just a drop of milk. next time will use less liquid. dropped strait onto pre-heated cast-iron skillet, then baked in oven. rose well, next time will try 2 make smaller. took a little longer 2 bake, and were a wee bit doughy, but delicious. ate w/ butter and scrambled eggs.

As others have said, very tasty and easy. I modified them based on the reviews and used 1/2 sour cream with 1 percent milk. My family loved them.

Wow, these turned out well. I used skim milk and sour cream instead of whole milk and yogurt, and wow you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Also, I used about half as much sour cream as the recipe called for, and they still turned out really good (this might keep them from being so doughy, as others have stated)

I just made these and like the cook from Tucscon I found them very doughy and a bit gooey. I baked them a bit longer but they never seemed to come together. Maybe I will reduce the milk next time.

yum! plus i had (almost) everything on hand. i made the following modifications, based on my cupboard/fridge contents: whole wheat pastry flour, lowfat milk, lowfat greek (thick) yogurt, no dill (don't like it). also, extra cheese to make the biscuit more a vehicle for the cheese. and, i coarsely chopped the cheddar, and used my hands/a fork to pull everything together, which worked fine. i am currently polishing off my third one! i really like that the biscuit itself is not greasy like most biscuits, yet it's still light and fluffy. there won't be any leftovers in my kitchen.

I was disappointed, given all the raves. These were certainly easy, but they seemed unpleasantly doughy. Maybe I didn't bake them enough, but the outsides were started to get overly brown. There were leftovers, which never happens with biscuits in my house.

These biscuits are fantastic - light, moist, fluffy and FAST to make! I've made them with nonfat yogurt as well, with no appreciable difference. They don't keep well, but that shouldn't be a problem, given how delicious they are.

These were fantastic! Using fresh dill is a must. I did not have yogurt or whole milk when I made these, so subbed sour cream and skim milk. I also crumbled my cheddar instead of grating, and this made for delicous pockets of cheese which were sooo good!! A real keeper!

These are flaky & delicious without being greasy! I substituted sour cream for the yogurt and served them with Bacon-Potato Chowder. It was a hit!

Fantastic. Light, moist, and totally addictive. I used all whole-wheat flour, 4- year aged cheddar, and subbed two tablespoons caraway seeds for the dill because I'm on a caraway kick. Grated a bit too much cheese so pressed the extra into the biscuits for the last five minutes of cooking. I got 18 biscuits from the recipe; they seem like average size to me.

Awesome & Easy...and Healthy! I made this healthier by replacing the dry ingredients with a whole-grain baking mix I purchased at Trader Joes; then I replaced the crumbled cheddar with bagged, pre-shredded cheddar I had on hand and replaced the fresh dill with a teaspoon of dried dill. DELICIOUS!

I made a few adjustments but great recipe to get creative. I thought these were exceptional although I had to replace the yogurt with sour cream and I used rosemry and thyme instead of dill. AWESOME!

Delicious! As I am without a food-processor, I included the cheese in the coarsely-grated state, and as I am without dill, I went herbless, and thought these were every bit as delicious as the non-modified version (which I enjoyed last week at the home of the Cook from Asheville, below!). A keeper. Great sliced as breakfast biscuits with egg.

Excellent biscuits!!! Light and fluffy. If you don't have a food processor, you can do the mixing with a fork. Yummmm!!

These have become a breakfast staple for us. I chop the cheese into chunks to make tasty pockets of melted cheese in the biscuits, and ususally add pepper, chopped ham and red pepper for extra flavour. Best cheese biscuit I've ever had.

We loved these! I made them with 6 tablespoons of butter because I had only nonfat milk and yogurt. I had to bake them for about 22 minutes, and my oven was well preheated. They came out great, and were very easy.

Made this with half whole-wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. Very tasty and easy.

Quick and easy, moist and tender, and very tasty. What more could one want from a biscuit recipe? Made a double batch and served for brunch - enjoyed by all.
