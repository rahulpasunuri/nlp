My favorite holiday cake! The flavor is intense and delicious, it's quite an indulgence. I make it exactly as written, no substitutions. I totally agree with kmstafford's review....don't expect great results when you replace ingredients or don't follow directions. I make mine a day or two before I plan on serving it. And because every oven is different, I would check for doneness after 30 min.

I have baked this cake for the holidays 2 years in a row to raves!! I call it "the fruitcake that doesn't suck". I followed the recipe exactly and had almost no water left after soaking the figs-whatever you have, throw it all in. I don't see how the cake could possibly be dry if made by the recipe-furthermore, the fat is what would make it moist, not so much the water from the figs. Oil cakes are different than butter cakes, so not sure about substituting on the fat. Use the oil (don't scrimp) and don't forget to toast the pecans-if you are a pecan lover-you will know what I mean when you taste it.

I have now made this recipe twice, in two different ways (once with all-purpose flour and fresh figs, and once with cake flour and dry figs) and there is NO WAY this is a dry cake. I rate this as my second favorite cake after of course, a nice moist chocolate cake. And it does get better day by day as it sits out. I've just served it for Thanksgiving desert, where my family all raved in unison. Success! This time I had followed the recipe nearly exactly, including using a low-gluten flour and simmering my 1lb dry figs for about an hour and throwing them and their water (there was up to half a cup remaining) in the food processor with the bourbon. The cake rose well in an empire bundt, was heavy but not dense, fluffy and *very* moist. It's so moist it doesn't even need accompaniment when serving. I wonder which recipe these other reviewers are using?

I am glad I read the reviews before attempting this. The left over water with the figs is apparently important! I followed one reviewer's recipe and subsituted some butter in lieu of all the vegetable oil. Everything else I followed per recipe. I baked for one hour in large bundt pan. It was not dry at all...just take care as to what you bake it in. This cake is amazing in flavor and texture! You can withhold the glaze, serve with fresh whipped cream, or ice- cream..or toast in small slices for a mid-afternoon snack with tea or coffee.

We would rate this exceptional. If you like bourbon, figs, and pecans! I used Turkish figs, took others' advice and added the extra water that wasn't absorbed, and then added enough water to the batter to make it the right consistency. If I hadn't, it might have come out dry. Baked in small bundt pans and watched like a hawk after 25 minutes until the edges started to pull away and the toothpick came out clean... really just c. 30 minutes in the small pans. Moist, sweet, sophisticated. I'm making more tonight!

My cake was also dry. And I did not add the water from the figs.

After reading the other reviews I altered the recipe a little, adding the extra liquid from the figs (which I think the recipe implies you are supposed to do) in addition to 2 tbs more water and tbs more bourbon to the fig mixture. I also added about 6tbs of softened butter in place of 1/4 cup of the oil. I baked it for an hour and it turned out great, a little crumbly, but definitely not dry!

I thought this was good. The next time I make it I may leave off the glaze and serve with whipped cream. I bet this would be good with a glass of port!

I baked this 50 minutes and did not include the water from the figs, very disappointed, like other reviewers it was too dry.

Very disappointed. Served it at a party and not one comment. It was very dry.

The cake is easy to make and the flavor does improve over time.

This cake is fantastic. As I was just now reading the other reviews about the cake being dry, I ran to the kitchen for another slice. Nope, it's still moist and delicious. The toasted pecans, bourbon, figs and spices are a wonderful combination and the bourbon laced icing is truly the icing on the cake! I'm planning on adding this cake to my Thanksgiving dessert lineup! I baked the cake for one hour and did include all the unabsorbed water used to simmer the figs.

I made this for Christmas and it was well-received. I can see why the other reviewers found it dry, I guess, but I didn't think it was TOO dry - just more of a crumb-y texture. Sometimes it is nice to have a cake that is not so oily. The glaze added enough moisture for me, but if you really wanted richness it would be wonderful with a creme anglais or touch of vanilla ice cream. The bourbon and fig flavors blended beautifully, and, as the recipe says, it did taste even better the next day.

Followed the recipe exactly and cooked it in the oven one hour. It was too dry. Since this cake is supposed to be moist I wonder if the recipe is correct. I did cook the figs (sealed bag variety) for well over an hour in the two cups of water and they never soaked up all the water so I discarded the extra water, which may have been a mistake, but the recipe did not say to add the liquid.

i was very disappointed with this cake. I baked it 25 minutes less than the time given in the recipe and it still came out too dry! I also didn't think it had much flavor other than the taste of figs.
