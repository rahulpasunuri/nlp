Substitutions: Used canned artichoke hearts in water, sweet white onion. For lamb used recipe for Mustard and Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb. Turned out the BEST lamb and vegetables ever. Served with Asparagus Salad with Champagne vinaigrette.

Very good, but beware the artichoke leaves: they turned dry and brittle. Next time, I will use hearts only. Served with lentils with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. The whole meal was yum.

Fabulous, easy. Good enough for company. I used two jars of non-marinated artichoke hearts to speed up the process. I served w/ roasted potatoes and a nice Cote-du-Rhone.

I prepared it with leg of lamb rather than rack of lamb and it was wonderful. I think canned artichokes may be better considering the time and money for fresh artichokes, you waste much of the artichoke. Next time I will double the amount of garlic so more sauce can be made.

Excellent dish. I made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I used artichokes from a jar and added some potatoes. I also put in whole garlic gloves and searved with bread. It turned out great. Will make again and again.

I've made this amazing dish many times. Last time it was for my sister who is a manager at an excellent, gourmet resturant. She said my dinner surpassed any rack of lamb she's tried at her place. Instead of seasoning the lamb with the ingrediants in this recipe, I use the herb crust from the Herbed-Crusted Lamb recipe on this site. I do every thing else the same, but add red peppers to the veggies. Oh, and I've never been able to find sunchokes =:( I just put extra regular artichokes in and it's fine. I've never put the garlic in a blender, (I hate dragging that thing out) I just mash it really well with a fork. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes and bread. It seems like a lot of work the first time you make it, but it's really not that bad. And definatelly worth it. Enjoy!!!

This dish is impressive to make for guest. Everything turned out fantastic. I could not find sun chokes but did use canned artichokes and added eggplant to the roasted vegetables. I also added whole garlic (cut off at the tops) and had those on the side for guest to smear garlic on the lamb.

This was excellent. I made it to the recipe including the sunchokes which I found out are the roots of sunflowers. They tasted like a parsnip when raw and like an artichoke when cooked. I did add some fresh rosemary to the lamb rub. And instead of pan-frying the lamb, we seared it on the BBQ. Despite the three feet high flames errupting from our Weber grill, the lamb turned out great. It must have been a "prime" cut of meat with a little extra fat to fuel those flames. Fortunately, none of our neighbors called the fire dept :-)

This was so good! No sunchokes at my grocery so I used yukons quartered and didn't parboil. Also, I skipped the blender at the end - just slipped the garlic out of their skins, mashed and added to the broth. Served with a frizee and boston salad with sherry vinegarette. Yum yum!

have made this recipe several times now, and it's terrific each time. I used canned artichokes drained of their water, cut up onions and threw in quartered potaoes. makes a terrific dish.

Great!!! Cooked veggies at 425 for 20 min - 475 seemed high; then added lamb for another 40 min. Added partially cooked yukon gold pototoes, carrots, asparagus, drizzled with olive oil, then later with chicken broth to keep moist. PERFECT Easter dinner!

I made this exactly to the recipe - no substitutions or alterations and I would advise everyone to do the same. This is a wonderful dish with a vegetable mix that is both unusual and excellent.

Very good, but felt the veggies needed a little more umph. Would make extra sauce next time.

Excellent recipe. My oven cooks a little hot, but all was wonderful. I might add more oregano next time I cook it and I did double the amount of lamb to make sure and have left overs.

Fabulous tasting and fabulous looking dish! I had company and everyone thought I had spent hours (I didn't). Even folks that weren't that fond of lamb loved this dish. The vegetables were out of this world and the garlic sauce was very easy and very good.

Wow! How flavorful. I took a big shortcut w/ the artichokes, and it was still incredible. I used jarred artichokes (soaking them in the lemon juice), and I didn't use the fanchy shmancy ones. Also, I peeled the garlic before cooking it and left it in with the onions. For the sauce, I just used the minced garlic (from a jar). Easy, delicious. It was prepared & ready to eat in about an hour.

I was at the butcher shop and they had these ADORABLE little racks of lamb, so I bought one. Hope springs eternal, since I really just don't like lamb. And I still don't, surprise! But the vegetables are out of this world. So much that tonight I'm trying this again with pork tenderloin. I do think the veggies would look better and fall apart and burn less if they spent the first 20 minutes at 400 instead of 475.

Great dish! The onions are fabulous! I also threw in some mushrooms. I didn't have sunchokes so I used potatoes instead. Judging from the other comments, I really missed out on the sunchokes. Gotta have them next time.

This is a grand recipe. I added a "touch" more garlic. The suggestion of adding small red potatoes proved to be a splended addition. To cut down on prep time I used 6 large frozen artichokes hearts quartered.

An impressive dish, but not for the faint of heart. It took me over two hours to make because of the extensive prep work, but the end result was fabulous (tasting and looking), and I wooed the hell out of my girlfriend's parents for their 25th wedding anniversary. Sun chokes are divine! Our appetizer was lobster halves stuffed with thier own claws in a bearnaise sauce from The James Beard Cookbook. Also great. Drank Viognier. I want to eat it all over again.

This is a very good dish to serve on special occasions, such as Christmas. The preparation takes a little while, it helps to do some of the prep the evening before.

This is not a review but a question to verify the temperature given in this recepy. Is 475 correct at this temperature the vegetables burn.
