A found it quite oily, next time I will try less oil add more basil and garlic.

Well, I needed a recipe for non-dairy pesto, but this isn't what I was hoping for. I, too, thought the pesto came out too thin and oily. In addition, this called for too little garlic if you like a nice "bite" in your pesto, as I do. I'm going to keep looking.

This turned out pretty well. I think I was a little short on the basil, but I'm sure it will be even better next time when I have all the goods to make the pesto according to the recipe.

For a much better recipe, search this site using the terms CLASSIC PESTO. This one is fairly similar to the 9/2002 Gourmet version which suffers similar faults. The recipe without modification calls for an excessive amount of oil, and the salt is approriate only if one uses coarse sea salt.

This is the best pesto recipe I've tried. I've cut back on the amount of oil, and have found that this recipe is better if the exact amounts are used. Additionally, I often grate some Asiago cheese and mix it into this pesto. Even my 3-year-old eats it!

My sister can't eat dairy, and this was the only recipe I could find that didn't ask for cheese. The pine nuts more than made up for the missing cheese.

I did not have the same success that the others had. I found that the olive oil was out of proportion to the other ingredients. I doubled the pine nuts which I toasted first, the salt and two cups of firmly packed basil leaves. I also increased the garlic 4 fold. With these adjustments I got the results that were personally pleasing.

I've used this again and again--no need for another pesto recipe! Why buy processed pesto with mystery ingredients when this is so easy and fresh??

I love pesto, and it's a good thing with all the basil I have. But you simply must toast the pine nuts. I also like to blanch the basil first, just for a sec, so that the lovely green stays with it. Unless you are going to freeze it, add parmesano reggiano.
