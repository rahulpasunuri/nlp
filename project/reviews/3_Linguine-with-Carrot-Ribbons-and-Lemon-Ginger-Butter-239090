Light recipe with good but mild flavors. The sweet of the peppers is well balanced by lemon. The lemon is very subtle letting the other flavors stand out. Will make again as a good pasta rotation dish. C+

Wow! I'll admit that I was skeptical about this recipe at first, but I tried it because it used up some of the veggies I had in my farmshare. I was expecting mediocrity but this was DELICIOUS. I used thin spaghetti and green peppers, because that's what I had on hand. I also added several garlic cloves with the ginger and sauteed some baby spinach with the carrots and peppers. It was so fresh and beautiful and extremely tasty. I'll be making this over and over again. Don't underestimate it!

Quick, easy and tasty. I eyeballed the ginger and lemon (probably went heavier on the lemon). The carrot ribbons were easy- I'd probably add another carrot or two next time. Will definitely make again- perfect weeknight dinner.

My review was intended for Farfalle with Baby Spinach, Walnuts and Ricotta! So sorry!

I took a few suggestions from reviews and used 4 med cloves of garlic (next time I'll use 5-6), 1/2 cup drained sun-dried tomatoes, and splilt the olive oil (half olive oil & half butter) to saute the walnuts. I always use a good quality whole milk ricotta (Polly-O or Biazzo) and salt it well. We all enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

Well...it was easy....I dont see how the carrot ribbons were a pain really. Took me like, 20 min to make dinner. But I thought the end result was strangely akin to herbal tea on pasta with cheese...??? I love every ingredient and think ginger and lemon are brilliant together with savory elements, but this just was a little wrong for me for some reason.

Easy and delicious. I made fresh linguine which lightened the dish further. Nice with a slow raised ciabatta.

Have made this several times, including for guests who gave it good reviews. I think a combination of butter and olive oil is best. It does tend to be a litte bit dry, but I may just need to add a little more pasta water, or perhaps spritz on a little olive oil. To get the narrow ribbons, try rotating the carrot a few degrees with each pass of the peeler. It goes fast once you get the hang of it. I think I'll try adding garlic, as many have suggested.

Disappointing dish. I made it per the recipe, and despite the rich and laboriously prepared ingredients, it was only adequate--rather bland. Definitely not an entree. Maybe make it with more ginger?

Followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed it. I like carrots somewhat, but this recipe allows the carrots/ginger to shine. Next time I'll try substituting some or all of the butter for the olive oil... I think with a little adjusting the flavor will still be retained. Light, zesty and filling - and an easy dish to make at the end of the day! (I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, but I think this recipe could be converted nicely to be vegan.)

I think this dish was great and I'll make it again. I made a few substitutions and changes: 1) whole wheat spaghetti in place of white linguine; 2) olive oil in place of butter (and a lot less of it  the recipe called for 2 oz, or 56 g, of butter, but I used about 4 teaspoons of olive oil); 3) a bit more ginger - the Epicurious recipe used 8 oz (about 225 g) of pasta for 4 first-course servings, but I served it as a main course for two and used 300 g); 4) I stuck with approximately the same amounts of carrot and peppers; 5) I reduced the amount of parmesan used (about 20 g instead of the 2/3 cup, or 150 grams (!!) called for). The result: pretty darn decent, for a first try. I think when you try to take a lot of the fat out of a dish, some tweaking is always required. Next time I make this (and it was definitely tasty enough to warrant a second try), I will fine-tune the recipe further: 1) I'll stick with olive oil, but use a bit more, maybe 2 tablespoons, to give the pasta a more coated texture; 2) even more ginger and lemon peel; 3) more carrot (the ginger-carrot combo was the star of the dish); 4) a bit more parmesan, maybe 50 grams What I'll really take away from the dish was that wonderful carrot- ginger flavour. I think it would be great in an autumn salad  spinach, grated carrot, goats cheese, and a ginger dressing maybe? http://eatingforone.coo kingfortwo.blogspot.com

This is a great recipe. Not sure what all the disappointment is about - not using fresh ingredients? I too added garlic, and increased ginger and lemon, and mixed in some spinach during the last minute. Served with rosemary grilled chicken. Love it!

Reviews here seem split 50/50 bland to yummy. I added garlic, red pepper flakes and juice of ½ lemon, more than called for in recipe. It was ok with modifications. Ginger and carrots are unbeatable combo but add pasta and it gets pretty bland. Granted, the recipe is unusually different and very easy. Carrot ribbons dont look like photo if using an oxo peeler. The peeler is very wide on an oxo so attempts to duplicate the picture are a waste of time. All in all, I would not serve this at a dinner party nor serve to guests. I would not make this again because it is not very memorable at all for a pasta dish.

Colourful and tasty as a foundation for braised black cod. Added white wine and chopped shallots to lemon/ginger/butter mixture and addded handful of fresh basil just before serving.

Was very good. Added garlic and red pepper flakes and topped it with grilled salmon. Its more of a side dish than a a main course

Last night my husband & I tried out and very much enjoyed this quick recipe. We will definitely make again but with some addition of garlic, more ginger and some crushed red pepper, to spice it up a bit.

soooo not healthy. butter and cheese? with some pasta and a few ribbons of veggies snuck in for what? I made it once - as is (see above) and second time, used whole wheat angel hair pasta, 2 tbsp olive oil, doubled the veggies tripled the lemon and ginger and added some hot pepper flake. It was ok. I like the ginger lemon - I just don't think the carrots work well in it.

Boring, boring. My husband made this for our kids because they like carrots- and they didn't like it!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. Not much in the line of taste... kind of boring. I won't make this one again.

A little sweet but a squeeze of that lemon will offset it. Healthy AND tasty, it just doesn't get any better than this, Mom.

Enjoyed this very much for supper tonight.Really great flavor and very easy to make, altho my "Ribbons" were not as pretty as shown in the picture, I will try to make them a bit thicker next time. A wonderful recipe!

We thought this was great--used previous reviewers comments re: adding more ginger and also added two cloves of garlic.

I followed the recipe closely, but couldn't resist adding a touch more ginger. It was really fantastic - I'm sure to make it again.

Made it last night and disagree with others, I really didn't find the carrot strips a pain to make with veggie peeler, although it is hard to make them THIN like the photo shows without trimming them down, left as broad ribbons worked well - and the result was so pretty it was worth it. I needed to add more pasta water than recipe said, next time I'll try using more ginger too. Got rave reviews from my guests even those who didn't like pasta much

Very yummy! will make again. I used Lemon Chive linguini and it really added a nice flavor. This was an easy recipe, for the exception of cutting the veggies - it was a snap!

I made this for dinner last night. I really loved the flavors and the colors. The carrot ribbons were a royal pain and made this a little more labor intensive than I had signed up for on a weeknight, but it was worth it in the end. It's definitely a dish I will make again and again.
