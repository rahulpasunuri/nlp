This is the kind of dish that gives healthy food a bad name. It may be good for you, but it just has no taste. Very boring. There are many better recipes out there for wheat berries.

Boring and basic.

This is very good...the contrast between the aromatic white basmati and the chewy texture of the wheat berries is wonderful. This is a great pressure cooker recipe...no presoaking necessary. Do the wheatberries under pressure for 35-45 minutes...do all the other stuff in a separate pan, basmati cooks quickly...then just fold in the wheat berries. Voila! Oh, and no reason why you couldn't use chopped frozen spinach is you don't have fresh on hand.

I loved this one! It was easy, tasty, flavorful, and healthy. This will be a staple for me.

I tried it with brown rice and wasn't impressed. I can tell by the way it was prepared that it would be excellent with the basmati. I will definitely try it again according to the recipe.

This was really good. The wheatberries gave the pilaf a slightly chewy texture, very nice. I made this for a dinner party, and everyone was quite impressed, no one had ever heard of wheatberries, so it was exciting for them to try something new. Will definately make again!

This has become one of my favourite dishes, and I'm someone who demands that food taste good no matter how good it is for you. I add bits of cooked fish, meat, or poultry as well as hot peppers or other seasoning.
