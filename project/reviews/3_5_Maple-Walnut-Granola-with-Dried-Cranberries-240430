Yum! I've made this a few times and love it as a wonderful and portable breakfast and snack! I like adding dried blueberries in addition to the cranberries.

Excellent! My husband couldn't get enough of it. He enjoyed it with his granola.

This is an exceptional recipe with a few modifications. Using egg whites rather than oil is great! My preference is to use pecans and to reduce the sugar to half of what is combined with the maple syrup--it is plenty sweet! I lower the temperature to 300 otherwise it gets too dark. It is important to take into consideration the pans you use--dark ones will bake hotter so I keep the granola away from the corners especially, but at 300 it is much less likely to over-brown. I also quadruple the recipe, baking on 3 pans, since it isn't any extra work, and I make it for Christmas presents. I put a little more of the mixture on my darker pan, and rotate the pans in the convection oven, first 15 minutes, then 10-minute increments to complete exactly the time given in the recipe. Always raves and requests for the recipe from others!

This is my new favorite - it's crunchy, light and delicious! Like others have suggested I cut back on the brown sugar and vary the dried fruit (apricots or blueberries are also tasty). I sometimes only use 1 egg white (if I'm short) and I never have maple extract and it's still great.

This is a fabulous recipe--with some alterations--especially because of using egg whites instead of oil to get the crunch! I always double the recipe, but use half the brown sugar (too sweet otherwise) and I use pecans as I prefer them in granola. I have given this as Christmas gifts and receive raves--friends asking for it even a year later!

This is a great recipe. I make a few changes to it because it is very sweet. I cut back to 1/2 cup of brown sugar, use one whole egg (otherwise I end up wasting two egg yolks), leave out the maple extract, and add about 1/4 cup of ground flax. It's also great with or without dried fruit. Very versatile, and I don't miss the oil/butter!

This was AWESOME. I made it with butter instead of egg whites, and added some more brown sugar. Didn't have any allspice. I quadrupled the recipe and made a bunch for breakfast. I didn't bother with the times, just took it out after 15 minutes, flipped all of it, then another 10 min, flipped again, then just waiting until it was dry enough to take out. Served it with some homemade vanilla yogurt. Yum!

What a great recipe especially since it contains no oil. It's light and crunchy. I would recommend baking it at a much lower temperature than indicated otherwise the egg white coating turns brown and burns. Stir frequently as well. Add the cranberries (blueberries work well too) at the very end as they can burn as well. I skipped the allspice and maple extract. They seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. Finally, I have added chocolate chips to the still-hot granola. Stir just a bit then let cool. Yummy!

This recipe was super sweet...I'm awfully sensative to sweet, though. After I read the previous reviews, I cut the baking time. Plan of Attack for the next time around: -replace syrup with honey and molassas -increase the maple extract by 1/2 tsp -dd 1 tsp. salt - omit the cranberries

Very good. I made it using sugar free maple syrup & splenda brown sugar ( for a diabetic diet)and it was still sweet and great tasting.

I added 2 tbs of butter, 2 tbs of flaxseed, and didn't use the maple extract or the allspice. It was great!

I love granola, and have looked for a while for a low fat recipe - this is perfect! I used dried blueberries, almond extract and a pinch of salt. I also kept an eye out for over- browning. This will be a feature on my Easter breakfast table.

This is good granola. It will be a fun recipe to experiment with a little. I had no trouble with burning the granola and followed the directions.

pretty good. I agree to cook for longer at a lower temp. I think it lacked a little of the kick that comes from a tiny bit of fat so next time I will add a little butter or oil, maybe 3 TBS or so just for that little extra taste.

I usually heed the reviews but didn't this time and also overcooked it. Still it was good, and the second time I made it I cut back the time to 30 minutes, and turned over the granola after 20 minutes. Much better! This will be a keeper.

Love the flavor, color, and texture! It can be made with clusters still intact if you don't stir it too much while turning. No problem with the oven temperature or timing for me.

Absolutely the best granola recipe I've ever tried. I cut the initial cooking time down to 30 minutes. Also, I didn't include maple extract and thought it was plenty sweet and maple-y without it.

This granola came out just terrible. It was so burnt although the top that wasn't burnt had great flavor potential. I think that if I were to try this again that I would reduce the oven temperature and the cooking time.

Cut recipe and half - it was good. I didn't think it was overly sweet like some have suggested.

This is an awesome granola! I made it with pecans instead of walnuts. I've only made it with half the sugar - it is plenty sweet that way. A prior review spok of burning the granola; one has to realize every oven is different as are the pans. You can move it from the bottom rack up after the first 35 minutes. I especially like that it has no oil. Very nice to give for holiday gifts! Everyone that ate it (a crowd at church) absolutely loved it and wanted the recipe.

This was my first time ever making granola and I thought it was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend loved it too! I can't wait to make it again. It was just perfect.

Like the above, it came out a little overdone. Tried it a second time with a shorter cooking time and it was fantastic. It just needed a little tweeking.

Disappointing. Following the instructions produced nearly burned granola with very little maple flavor. The magazine article describes this as low calorie, but the end product -- about 7 cups -- weighed in at over 400 calories per cup. I wouln't have minded if only it had decent flavor.
