Just made this, can hardly wait to get the ingredients for the sandwiches. Used Helmans Light mayo, low fat sour cream, and a wedge of good gorgonzola. Wanted the dressing a little looser so I added 4 tbsp buttermilk, better texture. Going into my "keepers" file.

I made this for a family dinner and everyone really liked these sandwiches. I would recommend making the dressing a little ahead of time, so that the flavors can marry. I used red leaf lettuce instead of arugula. This is an easy recipe to make, and although they are just sandwiches, it is suprisingly elegant. It's a nice dish for a buffet-style party.

Amazingly good for a simple little sandwich recipe. The blue cheese, peppery arugala, beef, and roasted peppers are a brilliant combination.

Yum! These sandwiches are an annual event in our household. Everyone we've served them to has requested the recipe. I must confess to substituting Feta for the Blue cheese. I also use Bolo rolls from the Grand Central bakery (for all you Seattleites).

I LOVED the blue cheese dressing recipe. I make it all the time. In fact,I'm making it tonight. I just couldn't remember if it was 1/3 mayo or 2/3 mayo so I had to look it up.

I've made this receipe at least a dozen times in the last two years. It's fabulous. Without exception - everyone loves it!

I made these for a day at the winery with friends, they loved them. Got great reviews. No arugula at store, so I substituted Romaine, which worked just fine.

I have already made this sandwich twice in a week. I made it without the roasted peppers and the butter. I just spread a little more blue cheese dressing on the top slice. Very good.

I have made this since I was a kid without the butter and arugula. I learned it from my sister when I was about 10 I love it. It may not be good for large crowds just because some people are allergic to blue cheese.

A great sandwich recipe especially for people who don't like sandwiches - I've tried ciabatta bread as well as rye bread. I never got to taste the ciabatta bread sandwich.) I sliced the bread quite thin so that the flavor of the meat and the dressing will dominate every mouthful.

I made these sandwiches for a picnic dinner to take to a play in the park 2 summers ago. I originally got the recipe from the magazine, bu then came across the receipe again here today was was reminded of how fabulous it was! It is yummy enough for kids and yet snobby enough to bring as a picnic lunch for a day of sailing. Of course, it is best made with the finest ingredients--i.e. don't skimp on the meat, cheese, or bread quality.

I served this during super bowl and it was well received. It's a bit of a trick to find rare roast beef unless you are willing to make it yourself. I found a deli that was willing to cook it to order. I would NEVER use low fat mayo EXCEPT for MAYBE a veggie dip! But I do believe a light sour cream would be just as good if not better.

We took these sandwiches on a picnic and my husband and I just loved them. We substituted low fat sour cream but not low fat mayo as I don't like that. We used the leftover dressing as a dip the next day. Great. We will keep this recipe in a file for picnic recipes.

Like others, I too used reduced fat sour cream and mayo. Next time I make this I will cut down a bit on the Worchestershire sauce. Fresh course ground black pepper also gave a nice flavor.

Great flavor, easy, and relatively light. I used non-fat sour cream and light mayo and used more roasted red peppers than called for. Next time, for added flavor, I will use fresh red peppers and roast myself. The jar version is a little bland. I'm going to try the suggestion by another reviewer & use the blue cheese dressing as a dip.

My husband said this was the best roast beef sandwich he's ever had.

Although this recipe is a little complicated for sandwiches, the blue cheese sauce is excellent with vegetables or as a salad dressing. I doubled the recipe, used reduced fat mayo and sour cream to cut out some of the fat and voila, an excellent dip for crudites. You could probably use a combonation of fat free and reduced fat mayo and sour cream with no ill effects.
