Not sure why I needed to soak the mandarins over night or why I needed to broil it. This was with out a doubt the worst recipe I have ever tried. Living in the part of Europe that I do mandarins are really expensive so I was not happy when this was a tasteless, icky wonder.

We used Grand Marnier on Thanksgiving and it was wonderful! We're having it again for Christmas.

Prob. won't make this again. It wasn't horrible.... The word "eh" describes it perfectly.

I agree with the Cook from Durham. In a word "Eh". NOT worth the cost of the St. Germain or the time.

I made this exactly as written - including buying the $35 of St. Germain - and it was just "eh." At least now we have a delicious liqueur for martinis.

I found a substitute for St. Germaine. Thatchers organic artisan liqueur - Elderflower. The store clerk said it was just as good as St. Germain and it was only 19.00. I am going to make this for Thanksgiving and I'm pretty excited to try it.

grand marnier will work instead of st. germain

this looks interesting but I don't have st. germain and I don't want to spend $35 on a bottle and bevmo does not have minis. Is there another liqueur that would be a good substitute? Thanks
