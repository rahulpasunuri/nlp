As an amateur cook and professional eater! I am quite familiar with the taste of French bread and pesto sauce. When I search for a bread recipe, I am looking for a recipe that shows me how to bake fresh and sometimes exotic bread from scratch. Not the direction to purchase bread and sauce and spread one over the other.

ha ha I was going to say what Cook from Ct. said. How is this a recipe, exactly?

I made my own pesto, which probably contributed alot more flavor than prepared would have, but I loved this recipe. Just because you don't "cook" it means nothing--I needed a quick side dish for some pasta and this was a great idea I might not have thought of. My pesto had nice chunks of cheese and garlic which permeated the bread as it baked, so when you pulled the slices apart, each slice was encrusted. It was delicious.

I have to admit that I have not tried this recipe yet but may I respectfully point out to the previous reviewer that this recipe came from the "Light and Easy" special edition of Bon Appetit. If you're looking for something more complicated, may I suggest that you narrow your query to recipes only from Gourmet Magazine.

What an amazing recipe. Not. Ooh, spread pesto on bread. Warm and serve. Who are you, Mr. Food? Recipes generally involve cooking. My dog could have thought this one up.
