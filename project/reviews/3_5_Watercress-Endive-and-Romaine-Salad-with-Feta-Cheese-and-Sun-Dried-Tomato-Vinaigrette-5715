I found this to be a wonderful, light salad to go with our Christmas dinner. The sun dried tomatoes added sweetness and were not at all overpowering.

Super salad - I plan to use watercress and endives again. As for the dressing, I did not find it overpowering at all. Flavourfull? Yes.

I brushed the walnuts with watered-down honey before toasting to add a little extra flavor. This recipe with or without the honey is great!

The dressing is very rich and the sun-dried tomato taste was almost overpowering. Overall it was good, but the dressing could be thinned out a little.
