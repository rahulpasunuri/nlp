A beautiful salad. I wanted a green salad so I brought arugula to the party. Doubled the vinaigrette to account for the arugula, but only added enough to taste. I thought the celery root element was all right, not as good as the apple and fennel, but my boyfriend really liked it. Lastly, I had pecan rather than hazelnut oil at home, so used that instead, and it worked well. But now hazelnut oil sounds awesome--I need to pick some up.

Next time I'll eliminate the celery root. Too much trouble to clean and chop.

This salad is excellent as written, except I prefer to peel the apple. I have also made it with some changes: add 1 shaved carrot, 1/2 daikon thinly sliced and chopped roasted hazelnuts (~10), keep everything else the same. Makes a very fresh fall salad!!

So simple, yet so elegant -- and delicious! This salad would be a lovely addition to a dinner party. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Made this for a dinner party and served it over a bed of arugula. It was terrific! I doubled the dressing, used 2 Tbs. Dijon and 2 Tbs. grainy mustard and used olive oil instead of hazelnut. I used 2 smallish celery roots, 1 fennel bulb and two apples. I dumped the bag of baby arugula in a large bowl, topped it w/ the celery root, fennel, apple then drizzled w/ dressing. Topped it all w/ parmesan shavings and 2/3 C. of toasted chopped walnuts. I'll definitely make this again! Serving it this way made plenty for a dinner party for 10.

I was looking for a recipe to use celery root since I received it in my CSA. This was pretty good. I did feel that the hazelnut oil got a little lost in the vinaigrette. I really like the fennel and apple, but not sure that I like raw celery root that much. I might try substituting jicama next time.

We absolutely loved the combination of flavors of celery root, fennel, and apple. I found the mustard in the dressing easily overpowered the nuttiness of the hazelnut oil. My fiancee loved the super-mustardy flavor. Frankly, if I'm going to pay big bucks for a bottle of specialty oil, I want to taste it. Save some calories and skip the cheese, it is also overwhelmed by the dressing. Add pretty color and texture by topping the salad with the fennel fronds (why throw them away?). I will definitely make this again and try adding hazelnuts or a gremolata topping.

I made this last night and was extremely satisfied with the flavors. I too chose walnut oil as hazelnut oil seemed far too pricey on my gourmet store's shelf. Not being a big fan of any mustard, I greatly reduced the amount of Dijon to the scantest of amounts and did not miss its absence.

Surprisingly good salad recipe. I had half a celery root left over from a soup recipe and this salad was the perfect way to use it up. Definitely cut the celery into very thin matchsticks - I recommend using a slicer on the smallest setting. I used olive oil as we were in a small resort town with a limited grocery store, but added coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts for flavor. My husband says this is a nice alternative to cole slaw. Will definitely make again - and trying with hazelnut or walnut oil instead of olive oil.

My review is for the vinaigrette only. This is a special recipe with subtle flavors that paired VERY nicely with pan-seared scallops atop a mixed green salad and a nice vigonier. It was a wonderful, light first course, and could easily be presented as a nice luncheon salad. This vinaigrette won't stand up to bold, over-powering flavors, but we found it wonderful if paired correctly.

This was fantastic. I did splurge for hazelnut oil which I'd never tried and found it very mild and very disappointing, and couldn't taste it in the salad at all. Waste of money, though maybe it was just a cheapo brand. But those of you who used walnut oil, good choice. I didn't bother with the cheese because we had a cheesy entree, but next time I think I'd add parsley strictly for color and maybe toasted walnuts. Really delicious.

This salad is really, really, really good - I ate it almost to the exclusion of our main course, and I don't usually even like fruit in salads. I also made it with walnut instead of hazelnut since that's what I had on hand, and a Fuji apple (note to Bon Appetit: overly specific apple requirements are annoying). I thought all the ingredients in the dressing were in perfect proportion, and there was plenty left over for other uses this week.

Who knew celery root was so delicious? I didn't have hazelnut oil so used walnut oil instead based on the author's comments about the nutty flavor. Other than that salad was prepared as written and it was excellent!

This is a good winter salad. Like a classy waldorf, maybe. I made it as directed except subbed all extra virgin olive oil for the hazelnut as I didn't want to pay the price for a special oil just to experiment with. The salad is fine this way, although I'm sure it would be better with the hazelnut flavor. If you don't like dijon mustard, you will likely hate it - the dressing is super mustardy. Be sure to cut true matchsticks - celery root is kind of tough if the pieces are too big. Also, the celery root is a bit tricky to peel, but you will feel like you have accomplished something amazing when you're done. I recommend a sharp knife, not a veggie peeler. :)
