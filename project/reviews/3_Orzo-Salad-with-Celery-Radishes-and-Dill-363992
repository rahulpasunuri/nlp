I altered the recipe to use white wine vinegar instead of balsamic (too sweet, I like tart vinegars) and substituted feta for more subtle flavor. I made it with a rainbow orzo and used heirloom cherry tomatoes in a variety of colors. What a fabulous salad I made! And so pretty, too. Will be making it often.

I made only one modification to this recipe when I made it because I *really* dont like goat cheese. After making this dish, however, I completely understand why it was used. I tried to use Asiago cheese which is pretty strong in flavor as well and we did not even taste it! In order to taste the cheese, we had to add so much, it sort of made it a cheese salad instead of a pasta salad! I also forgot to add radishes which I will definitely do next time. Overall I really liked this recipe and will make it again. However, I will increase the vinegar, add the radishes, and maybe experiment with some olives, like thinly sliced kalmatas or something.

I agree with the other reviewer who suggested the flavors don't entirely mesh well- but for different reasons. I love the goat cheese in it & individually paired with each item in it, the problem, I think, is the dill & balsamic combo. I think dill would be better served by olive oil alone, or maybe an olive oil & lemon juice mix rather than the balsamic. I did vary from the recipe a bit- I used dark balsamic rather than white but other reviewers suggest this is only an aesthetic difference and I substituted a penne for the orzo because I wasn't willing to shell out $7 for the one orzo option at Whole Foods!

I combined this with the recipe flavors of the similar recipe called Orzo, Pine Nut, and Feta Salad from August 2001 - These are some great flavors and the two ideas worked well I think...

We did not like this at all. The flavors do not go well together. I love goat cheese, but I think this salad would be better without it - it absolutely doesn't fit as a flavor.

Yum yum! Brought this to Easter dinner and it was a hit. Doubled the radishes (I think my bunches were pretty small to start) and stirred all the goat cheese straight in, instead of leaving some for the top. Definitely a winner for potlucks and bbqs.

Added a little extra goat cheese and salt for flavour but this one is a winner!

This is easy and excellent. I didn't have white balsamic so I used red and while the taste was fine the red discolors the dish, so I would definitely use white next time. You could easily substitute either feta or ricotta salata cheese for the goat cheese, though I made the recipe as written. Very flavorful recipe with nice texture.
