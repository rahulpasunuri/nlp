Great presentation for appetizers - easy to eat with one hand while standing. Have made this, and also with a variety of other "fillings". A go-to recipe for catring.

I made a modified version for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. For cheese, I found a soft "blue" goat cheese which had a pungent bite, and I also added some fried pieces of cubed pancetta on top.

This app. is easy to make and tasty. I add a bit of smoked salmon and it was really delicious!

I thought the flavor was quite plain, but my guests liked it quite a bit. Was simple and pairs nicely with more zesty appetizers, so will definitely make it again.

I found this dish to be a little bland. I do love the fact that you can make most of it ahead of time but I was trying recipes for gourmet group and this didn't cut it

A big hit at my housewarming party. First, exremely easy to make and replenish during the party. Kept the filling and Endive handy and just smeared some up when plate was low. Everyone really like it, it tastes fresh and is quite healthy!

This was so easy and not the standard presentation. It was a big hit at a progressive dinner.

Very easy and so good! All my guests loved these. I halved the recipe and made the filling the day before. Then I spooned into the endive 30 mins before my guests arrival. So quick!

Pretty presentation but I would use Boursin instead of making the cheese filling from scratch.

Wonderful recipe and very easy to make. I have served this a number of times at various functions and have received rave reviews each time. I love that I can make it early in the day and bring it out when I'm ready to serve it!

I made this for my graduate school final presentations. It was appropriate for mine, which touched on food presentation. Everyone loved it. Our professor from France was sopping up the bits that fallen off onto the plate with his finger.

Fab and fresh perfect for a bridal shower. I did chop some raddiccio with the endive cores to cover the serving platter - made a beautiful purpley bed for them.

This was a very easy dish. I made it ahead of time and brought the final ingredients to the dinner party. I 'assembled the spoons' while chatting with the hostess as she prepared the main dish. The guests enjoyed the recipe and said it was 'light and perfect for summer.'
