Made this tonight ,just followed the recipe. The only change I did was I seared the roast 5 min each side then indirect heat for about15 min, next time I think I'd only do it for 10 min. (1 1/2 lb roast ) The onions , BBQ sauce & roast complemented each other well.

I made this tonight with a bison trip tip. Tho only change I made to the recipe was to increase the amount of red wine in the sauce to 1/2 cup and allow it to reduce for about 5 minutes. The finished dish was delicous, we ate it all!

Great for making Broham sandwiches. Made this recipe with Root Beer baked beans and creamy coleslaw (find at Epicurious.com) and BBQ corn on the cob to complete the menu. I did not make the BBQ sauce as our tri-tip is butcher marinaded in a chipotle marinade. We served with warmed Stubbs BBQ sauce for the sandwiches. I cut the caramelized onion recipe in half for 4 people but would make the entire recipe next time to have more for the sandwiches.

We love tri tip and I wanted to do something different than the usual Santa Maria-style seasonings. Made this for a small dinner party with the barbecue sauce...adults and kids loved it. This is definitely a dish I will make again...very easy and tasty.

The onions are amazing! Short of that, the rest was okay. In my opinion, the onions make this dish (or save it). Want a real good BBQ sause, try Neely's from this site. I tend to like that one much better.

The onions and bbq sauce were great. We followed the directions for the tri-tip and it was rare, which is the way we wanted it. I bought the meat at Trader Joe's and it was so tough I couldn't eat it. Any suggestions on what to use for a marinade besides using the bbq sauce or some other method to make the meat more tender? I will make the onions and bbq sauce again.

Like other reviewers, the first time that I cooked this was also the first time that I had cooked tri-tip. Since then, I have made this recipe at least four times. The recipe is wonderful and we also loved the BBQ sauce. One time I forgot to purchase red onions and I am pleased to report that regular onions also fit well with this recipe.

This is the best tri-tip recipe we've ever had! Made it 3 times now for large parties w/ everyone raving about it. The BBQ sauce is fantastic. Make the onions alongside the tri- tip if you have a burner on your bbq & enjoy the yummy smell along with easier clean up.

Delicious and so easy to prepare! The onions were a nice addition. My first attempt at Tri-tip and a real success that I will definitely repeat. I made it exactly as the recipe directed and was sure not to overcook it. Rave reviews by all!

I've made this a few times now and every time it is delicious. The sauce is what makes the meat, though. I marinate the beef for a few hours in the sauce and then put it on the grill.

Having not barbecued a tri tip in a long time, I did not check the temperature soon enough; I browned the meat as advised, but after just 20 minutes on low heat the roast was overcooked to 150. I should have been testing it sooner, but relied on the 30 minute cooking time and thought I would be early. So, my own fault, I usually check temp much more often to avoid overcooking the meat. In spite of the well done meat, it was well-received by my family and the sauce was tasty.

Fabulous BBQ sauce! I BBQ's a flank steak after marinating it in the sauce for 3 hours. It was to die for! Tender, flavorful, and the onions were a great compliment.

The BBQ sauce and the carmelized onions were a nice added touch to an otherwise bland piece of beef. My guests went back for seconds, which is definately a compliment to Bon Appetit!

This was delicious, used one big piece of meat (nearly 3 lbs), seared it then cooked fat side up for about 45 more minutes on indirect heat. The onions were a great compliment, made the dish more gourmet. Yum!

My husband and I have made this several times all to rave reviews. The only problem here in GA is that tri-tip is not a cut of beef we typically find here so I had to go to a butcher shop. I substituted Vidalia onions for the red onions and they go great with the barbecue sauce.

The meat cooks much faster than the recipe states. Fortunately, we didn't follow the timing. I liked tri tip which I haven't tried before. The sauce is great and I'll use that part of the recipe again. I didn't think the onions were anything special.

We love bbq and have it several times a week, but we think tri tip is better cooked in the oven on a rack, fat (Yes, Fat!) side up, with an herbal rub. This review is about the Carmelized Red Onions. They were wonderful with the oven roasted tri tip.

This was fabulous! I seared the meat for only about 3 minutes per side on the hot side of my charcoal weber and finished on the cool side in about 25 minutes. I found tri-tip at Trader Joe's, both marinated and plain. The sauce cooked beautifully into the meat and the onions complimented it perfectly. Served it with Smothered Yellow Squash with Basil.

We've enjoyed this dish with company twice. Found tri-tip at Costco. The red wine barbecue sauce is the key. My husband has mastered grilling over low indirect heat on our Weber gas grill and I think that's the trick to good results from the recommended cook times.

I did not have the trouble with the meat being overdone. I don't think I really followed their timing directions, though, as I frequently use a small electric indoor grill (works great). In any event, I was getting compliments on this a week after the dinner. It turned out very well, and I was surprised how good such an inexpensive cut of beef could be.

get an instant-read thermometer, and you'll never look at any recipe's cooking times again.

The sauce was tasty, but I hardly got a chance to apply it to the meat, because the cooking times in the recipe were way off. As noted by the cook from Alexandria, the meat was already overdone after the ten minute searing over a moderate fire. I heated up the marinade and served it as a sauce, but it was nothing more than dressed-up ketchup. The garlic powder and salt rub for the meat was a nice touch, and I might use it on other steaks, but I was not impressed with the tri-tip, which was a bit tough and not at all inexpensive, probably because it seems to be trendy. The onions were wonderful, but the recipe, which supposedly serves eight, was barely enough for four after the onions had cooked down. Also, I had to turn the heat down to low; cooking on medium as directed for 30 minutes would have resulted in a scorched disaster.

I found the meat at Costco - it was nice and thick, didn't dry out AND it was $5.99 per pound. I didn't change a thing about the recipe, other than the cooking time. Even with the thick cut, the suggested cooking time too much. Nice flavors and easy to make. Meat was tender and flavorful. Didn't have the problem with fatty leftovers - meat seemed lean enough.

I thought this recipe was great. We had about 10 people over and they all loved it. But... I made some adjustments -- the key was that the meat was 2-3 inches thick (thus not drying out like the other reviewers). Also, I made 2 batches of the sauce: 1 to matinade in for 5hrs, and the other to baste with. Incredible flavor!

I would really like to make this recipe, but the link to the barbeque sauce is screwed up--its leading me to a recipe for sweet and sour cucumbers and I cannot find the sauce by searching...I love tri-tip and would like to make this. Please help.

I must have done something wrong. This tasted like a london broil with bad sauce. The onions were delicious, though. That sauce - there was some sort of a bite to it, perhaps from the liquid smoke. Maybe i added too much. The next day i took it out for sandwiches and it was so riddled with fat i felt completely nauseated. Tri tip is a horrible cut of meat, unless you like meat that is tenderized by lots and lots of fat. Yuk! I wish you had a minus rating for these recipes.

Absolutely fantastic. I made this the first time on a friday and made it again on Sunday. Tastes even better the next day. Use a smoker pack to really infuse the meat with flavor. And the onions with the steak are to-die-for! yum!

Excellent recipe. I had to search to find the Tri Tip roast, but it was worth it. In my area Whole Foods and similar stores normally carry it, but I had to call around to find one that had it in stock that day. We made it exactly as directed, except for the cooking time. We flipped it every 5 minutes, and it was done in about 15 minutes total. This is a new make again favorite.

This is incredible! The onions, the sauce OH MY! Regarding the cooking time of the Tri Tip, use your own descresion. We made extra for sandwiches the next day.

To Montreal: We have a few shops in Toronto that sell tri-tip, most notably Royal Beef on the Danforth. They've been selling this cut for five years, so a good butcher should be able to get it for you. I think it's proper name is "Bottom Butt", but I can't be sure.

We will try this recipe. The way we prepare tri tip for grilling is very easy: marinate it with Zesty Italian dressing overnight with plenty of sliced fresh garlic.

To Mellen from Washington State: If you use the search box in the upper right hand corner of the recipe page, searching for "Red Wine Barbecue Sauce," you'll find what looks to be a fairly good sauce. Hope you enjoy!

This sounds great but when I click on the red wine barbeque sauce it takes me to SWEET-AND-SOUR CUCUMBERS WITH FRESH DILL. What's up with that? I will try it but will have to improvise with the sauce.

If cooked as specified, would not be edible! Tri-tip isn't a tough cut of meat; in fact very tasty and steak-like. Whether it be tri-tip steak or roast, I usually treat it like steak when I cook it. Has limitless grilling potential!

This recipe sounds delicious. The meat with the red wine and spices would surely give this dish a satisfying taste.

We followed the recipe to a tee and it was WONDERFUL! By the way, if you think this is marinated meat, you haven't read the recipe. It's grilled meat basted with a wonderful barbecue sauce. Make sure to double the sauce to pass around.

The recipe says to sear it 5 min on a side and then roast on the cooler part of the grill for 30 minutes turning every 10 min. basting -- WRONG. That would ensure a very over cooked piece of meat. Sear it as indicated but then look at the thickness of your roast. Mine was maybe 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick. It was overcooked at it's first turnover in 10 minutes. I did use the thermometer but it was too late by then. The steak had cooked a total of 20 minutes and was still slightly pink (so not ruined yet) and very tasty. I like it redder in the middle so I'll cook it less next time. Overall a very nice tasting dish. I had not ever used tri-tip before. It was a nice cut.

This was pretty good, but recipes for marinated beef are common. Couldn't find tri-tip; a local butcher said it was more commonly found on the West Coast. The red wine BBQ sauce was good but required special ingredients that were hard to find in our area (liquid smoke, chipolte chili powder). All in all, tasty but a lot of effort relatively for marinated beef.
