Very tasty. Many steps--so I encourage you to prep the night before. Next time, I will double the tomato sauce (so good!) and half the goat cheese and replace the remaining half of cheese with cheese that melts well (i.e. mozzarella). For the goat cheese, whole milk suffices as a tasty and healthier choice.

Amazeballs. I wish I'd read more of the reviews before I cooked this, though. The goat cheese sauce prolly could've used a little nutmeg and I wish I'd used freshly cooked black beans spiced up just a bit. As for the prep' time, this is a great dish to practice fast-prep with. From first chop to in-the-oven it was just under 2 hours, with all fresh ingredients, and nothing made in advance. I did all the prep and my GF assembled it. For those of your having trouble roasting poblanos, do the broiler on a rack in the middle of your oven, and don't coat the peppers with oil. There's nothing to gain by doing that and it seems to increase the risk of burning them. It's critical to turn them every 3 minutes, too. It's super super good. I'll tweak the tomato sauce next time juuuust a bit :)

All the ingredients seemed wonderful, and the final taste was great, but the "lasagna'' was sort of mushy. Husband and son had extras and it is almost gone. Shortcuts I took were to buy "fresh'' salsa for the tomato sauce; chop 18 oz. of baby spinach in the food processor and mix with raisins and not cook at all. (Three pounds of spinach seemed way too much.) I wanted to love this but probably won't make again. The goat cheese sauce is awesome, though, and I'll try to use it elsewhere.

I was worried the chiles would be too spicy, but it was just right. However, I did have about 2-3 extra peppers regardless. I'd definitely make this again

This was fabulous! I'm sure it would be amazing as is but I wanted to use some of the changes in the reviews. The changes I made: 1) I used 8 poblano peppers. It was plenty to make all the layers. I roasted them in the oven and put in a brown paper bag until I was ready to peel them. 2) Tortillas - I added another layer (3 layers total) by using more tortillas - 8 or 9. I also sprayed them with evo and baked them all at once on a cookie sheet. It was very quick and easy rather than frying. 3) Tomato Sauce - I added 2 habanero peppers. This gave it a great spicy kick. 4) Cheese Sauce - My package of goat cheese was 11oz so I used it all. I also added some chili powder. (we like it spicy in this house!) This sauce is awesome! 5) Spinach - I blanched the spinach in a dry pan. I also added a little nutmeg. 6) Casserole Dish - I used a 9x12 GLASS dish. It worked just fine. The layers were kind of thin... I probably should have used 9x9. I baked for 30 minutes. The prep work takes time... but it was worth it. Next time it will be a breeze. I can't wait to make this again! Delicious!!

This is a fantastic dish. I've now made it 3 times and have devised a few shortcuts that make it worthwhile. I use only 5-6 poblanos and roast them the day before. The tomato sauce is easy - just throw everything in the blender, no chopping by hand. I use whatever milk I have on hand for the cheese sauce. I don't use a whole can of black beans and use the left overs for a salad to serve with the meal. For the spinach I used 1 bag of frozen. I also don't fry the tortillas and add an extra layer of them (3 total layers). This seems to soak everything up nicely and make all ingredients pretty balanced. Will make this again and again!

Okay, so the reviews complained that this was a bit bland and not very "Mexican flavored". My changes: * Added 2 chipotles w/ adobo sauce to tomato sauce. * Didn't have enough goat cheese. Used half goat cheese, half very sharp cheddar, added maybe half a teaspoon of cumin and chili powder to cheese sauce. * You don't need to blanch the spinach. I just chopped it and sauteed it with the raisins. * I didn't have poblano peppers (they are nearly impossible to find here), so I used 2 bell peppers (1 red, 1 orange), 2 fresnos, and 2 serranos. * Added another layer of tortillas in the middle to make it more "lasagna" like. My tortillas didn't become soggy because I quickly fried them until they were golden and crispy. * Added some corn into the black beans because I needed to use it up. Enjoy! It was very very tasty and I will definitely make it again! 4 forks with my changes!

The no glass baking dish made no sense at all and I used a pyrex one. This took me 3 hours to prepare even with time saving steps - toast all the half moon tortillas on a sprayed cookie sheet in the oven (to a crispy state), charred all the chilies at once under the broiler, no chopping of cilantro as my processor blades did a fine job during the puree, used frozen spinach. The result looked like the photo, and the taste grew on me as I ate it. But I found this dish to be out of balance. A can of black beans was too much earthy taste for me, as I thought it might be, and I doused then with lime juice to macerate first before anything else. The amount of spinach called for was close to over load - and did rob the taste of the poblanos except for the heat. Cheese sauce was good but not nearly enough for the complete bulk of the dish. The tomato sauce was worth the time IMO. I squeezed the spinach by hand and there was no sogginess anywhere after baking. The raisins were a surprise. Since golden raisins go so well with cous cous I used them and was happy I did. I want make this again, but will use it as inspiration to create something similar. Leaving out the long, messy business of charing and skinning the expensive poblanos for starters.

Rating: 4
the goat cheese sauce was just DELICIOUS and definitely made the dish. i cooked it for a little less time than directed, which left the sauce runny and as i cut the lasagne into pieces it seeped through all the layers, which was nice. i used currants instead of raisins and added pine nuts and it worked wonderfully. my total time was more like an 1 1/4 than 2 1/4 hours so you don't need to be deterred by the total time... just make sure you have an hour(ish) to give to the dish.

Rating: 4
Plenty of ways you can shortcut with this and still make a great dish. Use tostadas or corn chips instead of frying tortillas; marinara instead of cooking down tomatoes; 4-5 pkgs of frozen spinach instead of blanched fresh; and I wouldn't skip the poblano/pasilla peppers, but five did me fine instead of the vast amount called for by recipe. Serve with a few broken tostadas or chips on the side, tastes great with a little crunch and i don't think the tostadas in the dish will ever emerge from the oven with any snap left in them.

This is a delicious recipe that requires a good deal of work. I have made it three times and have changed some things that have reduced the workload without sacrificing taste. Use a good quality fresh salsa instead of the tomato sauce. Roast 6 large poblanos in advance instead of 12. Make the spinach in advance and add nutmeg-yum.

I was drawn to this recipe by some of my favorite ingredients but thought it looked like an unnecessary amount of work. I wanted to pull this together with some shortcuts for a quick weeknight meal. I omitted the poblano and added a bit of green chile salsa to the goat cheese cream sauce. Used jarred tomato sauce with the addition of chopped cilantro. Mixed salt, pepper, and cumin with canned black beans. Sauteed chopped spinach with garlic and onion (skipped the raisins). Then assembled everything, and topped with 1/2 cup of shredded monterey jack. This came together in around 20 minutes, then baked at 400 for another 30. My only change would be to cut back on the sauce a bit - the tortillas didn't retain their integrity and got a little mushy. But this is a delicious twist on enchiladas; definitely a keeper!

Really fantastic. Yes, it's time- consuming (very) and yes, it's a lot of ingedients... and oh yes, it's worth it. My sister's tip was not to omit the raisins (no matter how tempted you are) and I'm so glad I listened to her. They are a BIG contribution to this dish!

While this is a time consuming dish to make I believe it was worth every minute! I made individual dishes and froze them for meals later. Blanching the spinach and frying the tortillas are steps that just add time and aren't necessary.

Just a tip -- Coming from the Southwest, where the local grocery stores sell fresh roasted chilis by the bushel, and now living in the midwest, I roast my poblanos and Anaheims when they come into season, in small batches. Although in the southwest they freeze them with the skins on, I roast them, let them sit in a paper bag for 20 minutes, then peel them. By using my "Foodsaver," I am able to suck out the air in my bag to avoid freezer burn. They last for several months and any recipe calling for chilis is much easier to prepare when I know they are only a defrost away.

I've used this site for years, but was only compelled to write my first review after trying this recipe. I was really looking forward to making this dish. However, it took 4 hours to prepare (1.5 of them roasting, skinning, and seeding the poblanos--has anyone ever seen bottled roasted poblanos? I'm sure there would be a huge market for them.) The result was tremendously disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly, but the lasagna was mushy and tasteless. My husband and I agreed that it was the second worst dish we'd ever made (the worst being a dish we dubbed "Pasta with Dirt".) We couldn't eat it. I salvaged the poblanos and will use them tonight in Rick Bayless' tasty recipe for rajas. Anyway, I'll never attempt this dish again myself (and I'm an experienced cook), but I hope someday to have it served to me by someone with the alchemic knowledge to make it work. Good luck to you!

this was my first attempt at really cooking, and this dish turned out perfect! it wasn't soggy, as i expected it to be, and it was just spicy enough! i used all wheat tortillas, and because the local grocer did not have poblano chilis, i used habanero peppers. i used a bit less than what the receipe called for, but there was enough pulp. also, i only used about 125 grams of goat cheese, and this gave the cream mix a nice consistency. it was labour intensive, but worth it, and i will DEFINITELY make it again!!

I've been making & enjoying this recipe since it first appeared in Gourmet Magazine. Everyone except my daughter's boyfriend who won't eat spinach has loved this version of "lasagna." The only shortcut or subsitution I did was to use frozen spinach. I had no problem with the goat cheese melting, it was smooth as silk. The poblanos roasted beautifully, not mushy. I think the negative reviews are more cook error than recipe fault. The 1st time I made it I almost left out the raisins, thinking they were a quirky twist, but they add a nice layer of flavor to the recipe. Don't leave them out. My family has enjoyed this recipe for over 5 years. It has become a family favorite. Just don't expect a spinach hater to rave about it.

Although time consuming to make, this recipe is absolutely delicious. To make prep easier, do the poblano chilies a day ahead of time.

As everyone else has said, this recipe was extremely labor intensive and not worth all the hours of work in the kitchen! The raisins were a good and unexpected addition, but the dish ended up soggy and completely uninteresting. I roasted the poblanos in the oven, drizzled with olive oil (as I do when I roast red peppers), but there was almost no pulp to scrape from the skins. The goat cheese I blended into the cream ended up in a coarse-consistency, almost like it was curdled. In all, this dish was a complete failure and I would have found better success creating my own version of Mexican Lasagna.

My only problem with this is it is too spicy with poblanos so I substitute roasted red peppers and grate a littlw poblano for flavor over them. Am I making a mistake with the peppers I buy or just cant handle the heat? A FAVORITE either way

Unusual and irrestistible. I was cooking for people with allergies, so I substituted canned pumpkin for the tomato, spelt tortillas for the corn tortillas, and parsley for the cilantro -- worked great. The recipe requires plenty of effort, though. I used frozen spinach, but would also suggest mixing it with the goat cheese sauce before layering -- they always end up next to each other anyway.

This dish had wonderful flavour -- the raisins were a suprising morsel of sweetness mixed in with the savoury. I was suprised, but I think the goat cheese worked really well in this dish. I may try the black bean/goat cheese combo in some other dishes in the future.

I made this for Christmas and thought it was delicious. Although there were a lot of ingredients to prepare, none of them were terribly difficult. Because all, except tortillas, could be prepared the day before, it was soooo easy. The tomato sauce was particularly good. Next time a may try some chipotles to add a bit of extra spice to the tomatoes. Flavors were all very mild and worked well together, if you like them.

I definitely reccomend this dish, but don't be afraid to modify it to suit your tastes. I about 2 tablespoons of chile powder to the tomato sauce, which made for a sweeter, smokier taste that i loved! It's a lot of prep, but the results are great!

This recipe got the thumbs up from my entire family and it has made the "make it again" list. It was quite time consuming to roast and peel the peppers, which you can't really work around...but de-stemming and blanching the spinach is an area that I think we could cut down on time and prep by using frozen and it would taste just as good. The goat cheese sauce was thick and delicious and the fried tortillas, while maybe not good for you, added a yummy flavor. I will probably try to roast them in the oven next time as someone else suggested. My grandfather prepared some New Mexican chile that we accented it with that evening, but without that I may have sprinkled some jalapenos into one of the layers for added spice (which my family loves.)I also really like making things that are different and interesting and this lasagne fits the bill.

My husband and I are always in search of great recipes full of flavor and this one filled the order. We loved it! We did add about 1/2 cup chorizo to the tomato sauce for a little more texture and spice and we substituted "chili ready" tomatoes (a good accident). We also toasted the tortillas in the pizza oven to avoid the deep fry fat issue. It turned out wonderful and we are looking forward to making it for friends in the future. Thank you for a great new recipe.

I doubled this recipe and served it as the entree for a baby shower I recently threw. All close friends of mine, I was anxious to see how the receipe would rate with them (as most are excellent cooks and entertainers). I prepared most of the steps the evening before and fried the tortillas and assembled the dish the morning of the party. I even drove to 4 markets looking for epazote to ensure a perfect turn out. I spent $24 on 24 peppers (way too many peppers). If the peppers are as large as bells- buy 1/3 the amount the receipe calls for. I also layered in black refried beans in the center of the cassarole for more substance. The dish came out of the oven piping hot, golden brown and looking gorgeous- I tossed some lightly salted/toasted pine nuts on top and served with a tossed salad with pomegranate/ avocado / tomatoes / and roasted corn- dressed in a pear/pomegranate vinigarette. Everyone enjoyed the meal, however, few raved- it was sort of "another dish". For the amount of work involved, I doubt I would make this again for a large group but, I personally thought it was delicious!

Fantastic results but oh soooo much work. as others have said each step is easy but doing the spinach and poblanos takes a LOT of time. Don't cut corners, fresh spinach and roasting fresh poblanos is the only way to go. The sauces are simple to make. If you're considering making this recipe wait for a rainy day and the day and work will go quickly and will be worth the effort. I made the entire recipe including baking it and then had it for dinner the next night. This would be a great recipe for a buffet dinner party. (I rarely give 4 forks!)

Yes, it's a lot of prep work, but easy prep work and worth the effort if you've got the extra time. One thing I didn't get, though: why fry the tortillas? The bottom ones don't stay crisp and the top ones do because of the broiler action. I made half with fried tortillas and half with fresh and added an extra layer of them in between. I tasted no difference between the two sides. Also, I used canned Poblanos and only used six; even then, it was very spicy.

I made this as directed except did not pour tomato sauce in hot oil, and did not use pine nuts. It was a lot of work, and just a so so casserole. I was really disappointed. The one layer of tortillas on the bottom dissolved, and the one layer on top was not thick enough to add any substance. It was basically a spinach casserole.

Rating: 4
This is an amazing dish, if a bit intimidating. Do the prep work the day before, don't stress, and remember that it is a casserole. No one will be able to tell if each layer didn't look perfect, or you laid down the beans before the peppers or vice versa. PERFECT for when you have to feed meat eaters and non meateaters at the same sitting.

Made this Sunday night almost exactly as is. I had to use tomato sauce instead of tomatoes because of a grocery mistake, so I cooked down the sauce a little less than I would have otherwise. We thought this was really good, although not what we were expecting. My peppers weren't really spicy at all; they mostly added a lot of smokiness and depth. I thought they matched really well with the goat cheese. The spinach filling was kind of bland for me. I was afraid to add too much salt, but could have used a little more. I thought a bit of cayenne might be nice in there too. Not enough to make it hot, just enough to kick it up a bit. The raisins are a must! A previous reviewer suggested using store bought salsa, and I think that would be a great idea. Put in in the blender and reduce it like in the recipe. It would be easier, and just as good, if not better. REVISED 11.5.03: After I made this I put the leftovers in the freezer. I defrosted them and had them for dinner last night, and it was SO much better than the first time! The smokiness from the peppers had permeated everything else, the spinach had picked up some sweetness from the raisins. I now highly reccomend making this early and reheating it the day you serve.

Rating: 3
as a weekday meal, this dish has way too many steps, although they weren't too difficult. as a vegetarian entree, it was terrific--definitely in the category of "they won't even miss the meat". one problem for me, though--i after following the recipe pretty much to note, i didn't have NEARLY enough of anything to compose the recommended number of layers. did anyone else have this problem? also, just like any other odd, hard-to-find herb or spice, the epazote really adds something to the dish--if i didn't have any, i don't think i'd make it.

A comment about the heat of Poblano Chiles: They can vary widely. I eat a lot of different kinds of chile peppers and it's not unusual to have variation in heat within the same variety. If you are worried about heat, use a milder pepper, or a really hot pepper as Poblanos typically are in the medium range.

This is a great dish with one exception. Cut down on the amount of chilis in receipe. It is really too hot and I like hot. I would make this again for sure. My daughter is vegetarian and this will make a dish that all of us can enjoy.

This dish sounded so delicious that I had to try out the recipe. I followed it exactly but was not so pleased with the results. I'm Mexican so I am accustomed to cooking with peppers and eating spicy foods. This dish was not too spicy and tasted more "Tex-Mex" than Mexican. I was inspired, however, to try it again adjusting the ingredients. Next time, I will use Queso Fresco instead of the goat cheese and add onions to the tomato sauce. The pine nuts add a nice touch!

I made this recipe using the tips from previous reviews, including adding goat cheese to the spinach filling and doubling the tomato sauce. My only problem was finding the chiles, which none of the supermarkets i visited carried. Instead i bought twelve unmarked chiles with varying types of spicyness. this created a textured flavor and a surprise to the eater. i have half the casserole left and it is frozen until i have an occasion worth pulling a time consuming dish out for. i was extremely pleased despite the fact it didn't look like the picture!!! this recipe will stay on my shelf for future occations.

The key to this recipie is simplicity. I replaced the tomato sauce with store bought salsa, the fresh spinach with 3 pkg. of frozen chopped spinach and some fresh crushed garlic and the pablano's with store bought roasted red peppers. I also added used cumin, chili pepper and white pepper to the goat cheese sauce for added flavor. This was a great hit with my company, I got rave reviews!

I also thought this dish was too fussy. I like the idea, though, and would do the following: double the tomato sauce, replace the goat cheese sauce with crumbled goat cheese combined with the spinach, and eliminate the roasted chiles (the flavor was surprisingly unpronounced). Layer the recipe as described, substituting tomato for goat cheese sauce. Otherwise, it's too much trouble for an everyday casserole.

As others have said, preparing this dish is a lot of work -- lots of steps, a lot of clean up. But it was worth it, and was even better the next day. I substituted flour tortillas for corn, and toasted them on a pizza stone (saving the step of frying) -- it came out great. The only problem I had was the heat from the peppers, as several other have experienced. Poblanos are categorized as a mild/medium pepper, but of the twelve I bought (from a very reliable specialty store in Brooklyn), four or five were blisteringly hot. Will substitute a milder pepper next time.

I also think this has way too many moving parts for marginal return. We loved the simple goat cheese sauce (I used the epizote) though, and intend to try it drizzled on black bean chili, and pasta. I think it might be great with wild mushroom ravioli, for instance.

Poblano - not hot. Not like habaneros at least. They can have some attitude, but mostly a rich chile flavor. If unsure ask your grocer to be certain you have the right kind of chile. Best bet - taste a little after roasting - see what you think and know your tolerance for heat. As for the recipe - thought it was great. The rich goat cheese sauce blended with the chiles beautifully and the black beans rounded out the flavor. I used fresh tomatos, added some extra cilantro and skipped the epazote. I found it to be a mild (I like a lot of chile heat) but very rich and satisfying dish. Reheats well and well worth the effort.
