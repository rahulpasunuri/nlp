This is a simple, classic recipe that deserves to be in every cookbook for virtually any bird (except maybe duck). Personally, I prefer the basting. The wine/butter baste gives the bird a delightful crackly skin, and the addition of various herbs can match the flavors of the bird to the cuisine. We've used the recipe for chicken, as well as cornish hens, halved and served family style with fresh sweet corn and fresh roasted eggplant on a beautiful platter. A wonderful summer meal with a down home presentation!

I think there's no better way to roast a whole chicken than on a spit. I seasoned per the recipe and added a sprinkle of Herbs of Provence. I don't baste rotisserie chicken...removing the grill cover lets the heat out. The self-basting action of the rotisserie is enough. I also add some hickory chips to the fire for a smoky flavor. The crisp, nut-colored skin and juicy meat has the family drooling every time!
