Use this recipe every year now. I didn't one year and my family got mad at me. I add dried apricots and use sliced almonds sometimes instead of chestnuts. I like celery so I add that too. Basically I use this as a base and you can throw what ever your heart desires which is why I love it.

Loved it. I would double up on the spices (except parsley). Also, we substituted dried cranberries for currents and it was excellent.

I HATE stuffing and I think I ate about 1/2 of what was made. This is the most flavorful stuffing I have ever had. The onion and currants really make it.

This will be my fourth year making this stuffing. It is absolutely divine, a great combonation of textures and flavors and relatively easy to make.

A nice sweet/savory blend (currants, caramelized onions, and chestnuts all weight in on the moderately sweet side, but it's not cloying). I might substitute something a bit more interesting than parsely next time.
