I've been wanting to make these forever! I'm a very experienced baker and was expecting them to be delicious after reading all of the reviews. However they were dry as can be and got thrown away. I would make it again only to see if I did something wrong because they were sooo dry.

Made as is, hubby loved it. I wasn't so keen but only because I had to keep tinned pumpkin in the pantry. Tried it with roasted sweet potato without letting hubby know and he loved it more!

I followed the recipe to the letter and this turned out incredible! So tasty, love the crisp outside, love the chewiness of the dates alongside the crunchy pecans and the marriage of flavors is out of this world. I don't think it's too sweet, but if you wanted to make it less sweet like the previous reviewers did, I don't think the recipe would suffer. This is going on the Thanksgiving menu.

I loved these squares. Not much of a dessert person, but I remembered making these about ten years ago and dug up the file because they were really delicious. So, I'm going to make them again for a Bake Sale Charity drive...proud to attach my name to them! Krystyna

This was really delicious. I didn't have dates so I used dried cranberries. The tartness of the cranberries balances the sweetness of the cake. Definitely will make again.

These are good--not decadent, but good. When I saw the amount of butter involved, I thought these were going to be over-the-top rich. They're not. We served them with a homemade pear sorbet, and it was good match.

Very good! We ate them with our coffee on Thanksgiving morning.

Everyone loved this! Need to cut back on sugar, though, as it was on the sweet side.

These were so, so, SO delicious! I will be making these bars instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving next year!

I liked these very much - very moist and flavourful, and not excessively sweet (I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup). I used Medjool dates, and would do so again. The pumpkin is subtle, and marries well with the dates and spices. This cake smells amazing too. Also, the squares were a hit with everyone who tried them. I cut the cake into 30 smaller squares, and served plain. However, I experimented with a leftover piece, and did find that a good cream cheese frosting (had some left from a previous recipe) works very well if you want to gild the lily.

Took this to work and fed to my boyfriend and everyone loved it. I used fresh pumpkin and omitted the 1/4 c water because the pumpkin was more liquidy. Also used pre-chopped dates, which worked out well. I think you could cut the amount of sugar in this recipe and still have a great dish due to the sweetness of the dates, but recipe is good as-is also!

I made this recipe (without sauce or ice cream) for a Thanksgiving potluck - I was nervous about taking an untried recipe to a public event, but one taste allayed my fears. I thought it was fabulous, and it was extremely popular - all the adults loved it, but I was particularly flattered to see a toddler sneaking multiple helpings for himself. I plan to make this again at Christmas, and I'm looking forward to it.

I thought these were good. Very good but not great. The flavor is excellent and they are sort of unique. My only complaint is they are a little dry. Didn't stop everyone from eating them very quickly though. They are not too sweet and taste very healthy.

I don't like dates, but this is so good. Just plain, with no icing or topping, so rich you can just eat a small piece. My husband says it tastes like a combination of pumpkin pie and pecan pie and may be the best cake he's ever had. I chopped up the dates really small with a cup of flour in the food processor so they just added sweetness and texture.

OHMYGOD!!! This was fabulous! I'm not crazy about dates, but I put them in anyway and they were not overpowering at all, they were great. I made it with the cream cheese frosting other chefs recommened for easier traveling, and it was perfect. Will definitly make again and again...

This recipe was great! I am not a fan of dates, so I just omitted them. I also made a simple cream cheese frosting. 1 1/2 lbs. cream cheese-Room temp, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 stick butter-Room temp., 1 TBS vanilla. This will make enough to frost 2 recipes (Depending on how much frosting you want on your squares!)- YUM!!!!

Everyone who tasted these raved about them. Personally, I'm not a fan of desserts that don't have chocolate in them, but I found that I couldn't resist these. They almost melted in your mouth! I made the recipe as written except instead of the bourbon sauce I used cream cheese frosting (easier to travel with).

Very good. Has a bread-like or fruitcake consistency. Definitely better after fully cooled, and really great the next day.

This disappeared! It's sweet without being overpowering, and dense without being too rich. It reminded me more of pumpkin bread than anything else. I used the dates and pecans, and while I'm sure other stir-ins are equally yummy, this recipe was so good as it is that I wouldn't change a thing.

Quite tasty and very moist. I used walnuts in place of the pecans and didn't bother with the sauce or ice cream. Next time I might throw caution to the wind and add chocolate chips as well.

Love love LOVE these! (And so did everyone else!) I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts; and since I had it, I used buttermilk instead of water. Also made a cream cheese frosting, but they are delicious even without it. Dense, moist, and yummy!

Funny how you think you have the things to make something, well I made this using Sweet Potatoes and Walnuts! It turned out great!!!! Raves from my friends and family.

This cake is easy and satisfying. It stands well on its own; adding sauce seems a bit excessive. I substituted raisins for the dates and pecans since I don't care for either of the latter, but 2 cups of raisins proved to be too much. Perhaps 3/4 to 1 cup of raisins would do the trick.

I made these squares and we're just eating them plane, without the sauce or the ice cream. They're wonderful to add to brown bag lunches just as, wonderful for breakfast, wonderful just to eat! I'll definitely make these again!

I agree - moist and delicious, but make sure you like dates.

The cake was very moist and delicious. I made a glaze with maple flavoring, powdered sugar and a little water...WOW...it just cemented the flavor! The cake was very easy to make.
