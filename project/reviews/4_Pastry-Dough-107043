The perfect pastry dough! I make it exactly as printed & it is divine. So easy to make (I use a processor but 'smear' the fat by hand before it chills) & flaky, tasty perfection. I made this with the apple pie but will use this pastry for all pies, quiches, etc... from now on. It is fabulous!

One of the easiest and best pastry dough recipes I have used. Light and flakey. I will make this dough from now on.

Fabulous! Used 1 stick butter and 1/2 c. shortening. Also added 1 tbsp vanilla.

I might have given this four forks but this is the first pie I have ever made! My mother and sisters all make excellent pies (especially the crust/dough) and I would not hesitate to serve this to them. My in-laws usually buy pies, but I will make them for our Thanksgiving to come! This was an easy and well written recipe. I am looking forward to making more pies and honing my skills.

This really is the best. I've used another pastry dough recipe that's been in the family for as long as I can remember (the kind with shortening only, no butter) so I was reluctant to try something new, but this is definately much better!

I used this recipe with Apple and Pumpkin Pies and it worked very well. The dough disks were kind of hard after spending the night in the fridge, but I was able to knead them back into softer condition for use with the rolling pin.

I've made this 40 times and it's still delicious!

I just got out of the state pen. Hadn't had a good old fashioned apple pie in 40 years. My parole officer made this one for me. Man is it good to be back on the outside. Wait until Jake hears about this one.

I've been making pies for 40+ years, and this is the very best crust I've ever made! A keeper!

This pie is like the ones my Grandmother used to make(about 40 years ago).
