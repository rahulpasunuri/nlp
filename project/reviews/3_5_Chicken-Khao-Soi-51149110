This soup is absolutely amazing!! I doubled this using two small bottles of store bought curry paste then added fresh ginger,1 jalapeno, cilantro, shallot, garlic and spices to taste .It took some time but certainly not hard to make. I would recommend adding more chicken. Well worth the effort!!

I had just returned from a trip to South East Asia when I saw this recipe on the cover of Bon Appetit! Couldn't have asked for a better Thai noodle dish. I agree with some of the reviewers that it could be a little hotter, other than that I'll make it again as is. Toppings are a must!

This was quite good; you are making a special Thai red curry paste from scratch, so an electric Indian mixie blender comes in handy. I used guajillo chiles--they are large, almost the size of dried bell peppers, and the recipe yields about twice as much curry paste as you get in the little cans from Thailand, producing a nicely spicy/hot/but not too hot dish. The garnishes are very important here to the outcome of this dish. A great shortcut to chopping and frying fresh shallots is to buy a big container of dried onion flakes or whatever mccormicks calls them, and shallow fry them in plenty of hot oil for a minute or two until nice and brown, drain well on paper towels, cool, and store in a screw top jar. You will find MANY uses for this wonderful very crisp tasty garnish. And you will definitely want to cool and bottle the onion flavored oil for future uses. Don't understand why some reviewers are complaining that the dish needs lime juice, cuz its already in the recipe duh. Do not add the noodles until serving time if making ahead because they will soak up all the creamy broth. The dish (without the noodles and garnishes added) keeps well for days and tastes great reheated, especially with thigh not breast meat which can toughen when reheated. . I thought 1/2 TB kosher salt was perfect amount of seasoning. The only thing I changed was I cut way back on the noodles--like 2 oz per serving is plenty for me. And I would cut the noodles into manageable lengths so you can eat this with a spoon; otherwise eat with fork and spoon (Chinese noodles are impossibly long). If you want to dress them up, pluck the ends off your bean sprouts and have them very fresh--gives a fresh pearly white pristine look to the garnish. This dish is definitely something I would not regret if I had ordered it in a restaurant. Wonderful depth of flavor, delightful crunch against the creamy sauce and toothsome chicken---and beautiful to look at---turns out exactly like the picture.

I loved this soup so much I am bringing the recipe to chicago so I can make it for my daughter. The spices were great I added some jalapanos to kick it up and also extra broth, I also used rice noodles.

way too much work for not enough flavor. it was edible - barely - with enough chili oil and lime juice but i can't imagine making it again.

This dish was perfect for a rainy night at the coast. My mom made it, and we all appreciated the deep, earthy flavors. The noodles soaked up a lot of the broth.

Although a great idea for a recipe is here, I was disappointed with two things. 1) The need for heat- minced thai pepper 2) The need for acid- lime or lemon juice. I think the base recipe is spot on, I just can't recommend enough to add the heat and acid to make it better.

I have eaten a lot of curry in my life - this was delicious. I prefer mine a bit sweeter so added more sugar and of course, salt. This is a lick your plate dish - can be made with any meat, shellfish or tofu. Also, wasn't spicy enough for my taste so I would recommend a bit more heat. A very simple dish to make - I will definitely make this again!

First off, this is absolutely not a soup. It's a standard red curry sauce with chicken (or shrimp, which I subbed in). It's much too thick to be thought of at all as a soup, and I think I will have my leftovers over rice instead of noodles. As far as curries go, it was easy and fun to make, but I don't think the flavor was at all different from just using a store bought red curry paste (which requires no effort). I was really disappointed because the homemade curry paste smelled so delicious when I was cooking it. Oh well!

This recipe is very good. I was worried it might be too spicy but it was even a bit mild for me. It makes too many noodles though. I would only make 1/2 lb next time.

without a doubt one of the best things i have ever made. confirmed by my family. out of necessity had to make a few changes and add some things too. i only had pasilla chiles. used 5. also added 4 serrano chiles as we wanted it hot. in the end i also added a big jalapeno because i am an addict. a chile addict. made this with organic chicken breasts. also used udon noodles as this was what i had. the biggest change i made i think is that i added fresh ripped kaffir lime leaves and harvested my kaffir limes and used those in place of normal limes. if you like cooking thai, get a kaffir lime tree. not as hard as it sounds. i know i first laughed out loud when a cookbook suggested this. i have mine in a pot and my friend grows hers in the ground and we live on the coast and it grows very well. the leaves you can use immediately but you will have to wait for the limes themselves. again, TOTALLY worth it. next time i will double the recipe...it is that good.....
