This is a good basic recipe, but to punch the flavor on it, add a whole sweet onion that has been finely sliced, and one pulzerized garlic clove. Add salt and pepper to taste, and more bacon? Well, of course! You can add a package of simply potatoes from the grocery store and make it a whole meal!

This is the only way I could get some people in my house to eat cabbage. I would use more bacon if I ever made it again. Garlic and pepper would definitely add more flavour as well.

took warning of last reviewer and jazzed this up by adding roasted garlic and lots of salt to boiling potatoes and the cabbage. Would make it again like that.

A bit like colcannon, but not nearly as good.

I found this an odd recipe at first glance, however I was pleasantly suprised and will definitely make it again.
