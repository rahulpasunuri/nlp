The risotto turned out too good for the recipe's sake - none made it into cakes...

These are a lot of work but worth the effort - I made them ahead of time on a griddle and reheated in 325 degree oven just before serving. These are so much better than risotto for dinner parties because they can be done ahead. They go equally well with chicken, beef, and lamb.

I made this as risotto, not the cakes and I was disappointed. There was really no flavor. I liked the wild-rice, but I think I'll stick to my old risotto recipe and just throw-in wild- rice

I made this strictly as risotto--I omitted the celery and used chicken stock in place of vegetable and dry white wine in place of Marsala. I added saffron and used more wild rice than called for. The wild rice and fresh herbs are a nice addition to risotto and I would make it again.

A typically fussy Gourmet Magazine recipe. It worked well for a dinner party since it's a clever way to make risotto ahead of time. I recommend you make your favorite risotto (probably with a *much* shorter ingredient list), then add the eggs and fry the cakes as directed. And get a griddle so you can fry 8-10 at a time.

I love risotto but don't like making it for dinner parties because it is too labor intensive. I thought these would be a nice compromise. They are good, and it's nice that they can be made ahead, but they are A LOT of work. You need to keep the cakes small so they hold together, which means you end up at the stove for a LONG time. And in the end they aren't as good as a fresh, creamy al dente risotto.

It was the first time that my new girlfriend was going to meet my parents, two years ago. My girlfriend DOES NOT cook, yet wanted to make a good first impression on a gourmet driven family. I found this recipe and thought it would be a) easy, yet tasty and interesting side dish for her to prepare, and b) a nice accompaniment to the lamb chops with mint aioli and heirloom tomato salad that I was preparing. She accidentally cut her finger when preparing the dish and felt embarassed to ask my mother for a bandage. So not to be defeated, she got tough, wrapped her finger with a napkin and made the risotto cakes with a new confidence towards cooking. They were absolutely delicious and were well received. Two years later, my girlfriend still prefers to let me handle all of the cooking, but her efforts making this one dish on that occasion won myself and my parents over. We love you Emily!

Nice change from regular risotto.A lot of work but it does make a big batch (froze leftovers for another time).

I made this dish to accompany seared duck breast in cherry sauce. EVERYONE RAVED about these risotto cakes. I too, made cakes ahead and froze them. HINT: use 1/2 cup measure to pour batter onto griddle vs. 1/4 cup.

We have made this recipe for each of the 4 years since it was published. It has become a staple in our home for Thanksgiving. Everyone has loved it and many have requested the recipe. It is also delicious with eggs the following morning for breakfast. Yum!!

The risotto was delicious as is. the wild rice was an interesting contrast to the creamy arborio.I used chicken stock instead of vegetable which gave a richer taste. Was less successful with the cakes. Next time I would make them thicker and use more oil in pan, and probably a whole egg which would help them to hold together better.

Wish I could give this 3.5 forks. Delicious, deep, earthy flavor, wonderful. The best part- I froze them a week in advance, then thawed that morning and heated in the oven just before serving. I couldn't tell the difference between the cakes that were just made and the ones I froze!

I made these for my sons' birthday party. Adults and children loved them and I had many requests for the recipe. As other reviewers have mentioned the recipe is a lengthy process. I fry them the night before and brought to room temperature before rewarming - I was worried that they might be soggy but they were fine.

Have now made this 2 years in a row for vegetarian friends at Thanksgiving. Very delicious. Time consuming but some work can be done ahead.

The trickiest part of making these was the frying of them: It was difficult to fry them enough so that they held together but not so much that they got too brown. Nevertheless, my guests gave them a thumbs up, so some day when I have lots of time, I may make these again.

We were really surprised at the complexity of flavours that this dish gave. Time consuming recipe, but I cut the time a little by putting the mixture in the deep freeze to cool it more quickly. The wild rice was a bit too crispy, I think I'll not make the cakes as thin next time.

Made a great side dish at a recent gathering. I made it for a dietary resricted group ( my grandmother-in-law has a gluton free diet) and it was quite a hit!

I made this as a side dish for thanksgiving and they were the hit of the meal. Great texture and flavor. They were time consuming, but if you're in the mood for a multi-step process, you'll enjoy it.

Very good. Crisp on the outside and mushy on the inside. A nice alternative to regular risotto. My husband loved it.. Will make again.

Tasty recipe, very labor intensive. Guests enjoyed it. Not for the health-concious due to frying of the cakes. A challenge, but a good side dish.
