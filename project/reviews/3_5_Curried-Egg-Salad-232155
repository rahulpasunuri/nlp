Very tasty egg salad. I also added cumin, ground ginger, garlic powder, garam masala, white pepper, paprika, and old bay to the mix. The apple in it was so good! I would definitely make this again.

Very different and tasty egg salad. Easy recipe for when you want to change up your egg salad. I left out the apple and it was still great. Flavors all work really well together.

This is my new favorite egg salad. I think the lime juice makes all the difference!

I just made this for the first time... SO GOOD! :) A different type of egg salad with the curry powder, but I love it and definitely recommend it! The onion and cilantro really ties in all the flavors in my personal opinion. Yum! Will certainly make this again.

Wow, this egg salad is incredible tasty. I ended up forgetting a lime at the grocery so I added some vinegar instead since it's sour/tart as well. I definitely want to try it with lime next time, but the recipe turned out incredible anyway.

Very easy to make...I used 1 teaspoon of curry powder instead of 1 1/2, and 1/16 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I also substitute chopped red onion for green onions and the recipe came out great!!!

This is a great egg salad! Love the combinations of flavors and textures. Will definitely make again. Used regular mustard because I didn't have any dijon and it was great.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I love curry and think it is a perfect compliment to a tart apple. I used parsley instead of cilantro and green onion as suggested by a previous review. I've also substituted a store bought rotisserie chicken and added some toasted almonds. Perfect with toasted bread & green salad.

Delicious! Just made this for dinner and will definitely make again. I used 5 whole eggs and 2 egg whites, omitted the apple and used spring onions instead of red because that's what I had. We ate the salad on toasted whole wheat english muffins but will serve with Carr's water crackers at an upcoming picnic this summer.

I made this and it was great we used FUJI apples because of our West coast area. I do NOT like all these people who change the recipe then say it is Bad Do it the way it should be then make an adjustment Alexx Vancouver BC and Auckland NZ

my partner loved it, but I think it was a tad strange. i suggest leaving out the apples, adding more cilantro and less curry. if your love for curry outweighs your love of a hearty egg salad, you will love this recipe. for me, im just an egg salad lover.

Great, great recipe. Have made it many times with eggs or with poached chicken breasts, and it always gets compliments. I make it exactly as written, although I have been known to be a bit heavy-handed with cilantro...

I liked the general approach to curried egg salad this recipe provided. Howver, I did alter it somewhat and it turned out great. My alterations: less mayo (approx 4 tbsp), subbed lemon juice for the lime juice, was a little more generous with the curry powder, used less onion (it can overpower the salad if you are not serving it immediately), and while I adore cilantro, I had none on hand so I added a handful of dried cranberries, which added color and great flavor. Oh yeah, and ditch the dijon, I would chalk that up to the funny taste other reviewers commented on. I take my curried egg salad for lunch with arugula greens, shredded carrots and nutty crunchy crackers.

I thought this was great and my boyfriend liked it too, but a little on the spicy side. I would definitely make it again though!!!

I loved it. I put the salad in rice paper wraps, and served them as a substitute for bread-heavy sandwiches. I didn't have cilantro and didn't substitute for it. I served it to a group, and it was well liked. I think people were delightfully surprised at the combination of egg, apple and onion.

Apple and curry go together nicely, but maybe not with boiled eggs, and mustard makes it worse. This tasted weird.

Terrific for an out-of-the-ordinary egg salad. I added 1/4 cup of diced orange bell pepper for additional color and crunch. I think 1 tsp curry is sufficient, and add 1/8 tsp white pepper to give a little more kick.

OK but not special. Did like the curry but wanted it more pronouced, maybe contrasted with ginger or something. Liked the apple too except that it seemed unsuitable for sandwiches though fine for a salad plate.

I was very disappointed as I love eggs, curry and apples. I made it exactly as written, but I thought the taste was peculiar.

After reading the reviews, I was expecting something really good. What I got was something that was just okay. I love almost anything with curry, so I was eager to give this a try, but I was a little disappointed in the final result. There are better egg salads out there. (To be fair, I have to point out that I didn't have dijon mustard and had to substitute a spicy brown mustard instead. Perhaps that is the make-or-break point, but I am doubtful.)

Try it with coursely grated firm tofu instead of eggs...very yummy, for the strict vegetarian!

Wonderful dish. The cilantro really gives this egg salad some sparkle. The apple lightens the dish also...good combination with only enought mayonaise to hold things together. Great to serve when your air conditioner is broken and the repair is taking close to three weeks....

Easy to make, doubles nicely. The flavors are great together--curry and apple. I received lots of compliments from this dish.

Actually, Mankato, not ALL lemon pepper comes with salt. I have purchased lemon pepper that was salt-free (something an "informed consumer" just might know already).

Alamogordo, NM -- please read your labels, the first ingredient in lemon pepper is not lemon, nor is it pepper. It is Salt, so you are not saving changing your sodium intake significantly. Not meaning to be snippy, just trying to get you to read the labels & be an informed consumer.

Curried Eggs come from a special breed of Chickens who are fed a hand mixed, very special diet. Much like Chocolate Milk being produced only by a special breed of Cows - The Brown Swiss Cows. If you lived in the Heartland of America, you'd know all these different breeds!

Where can you find curried eggs? Ah, they are laid by curried chickens . . .

This is an outstanding take on an old favorite. Quick and easy and tasy enough to stand up to a good rye bread. Will keep this dandy little recipe around and will make often. Used light mayonaise and still came out great.

This is a fabulous tasting egg salad and you might not even know it has eggs in it! Decreased mayo to 4 T. and can use light version; lemon juice can sub for lime juice, decrease salt. Boffo good!

I loved this recipe. I was unsure about the apple, but it went perfectly with the other ingredients. (used a fuji apple instead of Granny Smith) I will probably use less mayo next time, but overall it was delicious!

This was really good but neither my husband nor I liked the apple. I left out the cilantro.....I love it but my husband hates it. I would make this again without the apple.

Great taste and texture--not mushy at all as I'd feared (unlike other egg salad attempts). The onion and apple add such a nice crunch, and the cilantro and curry go so well together. At first my roommates were skeptical when they saw me slicing an apple to put into egg salad, but they loved it too after tasting it!

A nice way to serve egg salad. Don't use Granny Smiths because there are a lot of other sprightly,tart apples avaliable for us. The apple added a wonderful crunch.

What a fresh and delightful take on egg salad! I substituted fresh dill for fresh cilantro.

What a great recipe! Tasty alternative to traditional egg salad. We used a Braeburn apple instead since we didn't have a Granny Smith and loved it!

The crispy tart apples add a nice touch. Next time I'll try it with a sweeter apple for more contrast, maybe Fuji.

Catered the egg salad for a luncheon on Memorial Day. I decided to give them a selection - this was one of 3 I made, with RAVE Reviews! Not a spec of it came home so will definitely make this again, just as it is written.

The apple and cilantro cut the heat of the cayenne and curry. I served the salad on dark rye and the results were delicious. I'll definitely make it again.
