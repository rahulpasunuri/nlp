This is one of my husband's favorite meals, which is something given that we both grew up in the Midwest and tend to be meat and potato types. The best thing about it is it is super easy to prepare which makes it a great meal for a week night. It is also a nice vegetarian meal. Anyway, add some bread or other side to complete the dish. I have found halloumi cheese to be a tad difficult to find. Here in the Midwest, I have found it only at Whole Foods.

I love this salad - it's one of our summer grilling go-tos. I make it as written, except I pan fry the Haloumi (I agree with the below reviewer's friends - I'd be afraid it would slip through the grates). Delicious every time!

I thought I was going to love this recipe. However, the Halloumi turned out rubbery and not soft on the inside. Perhaps it was the brand I used (from Cyprus). The rest of the dish - grilled romaine and red onions in the mint vinaigrette - was very good.

Fantastic. Really the best thing I've eaten in a long time.

Fabulous! I was hesitant about grilled romaine and cheese initially, but it was great. The dressing was zesty and fresh with the mint/red wine vinegar combination. The cheese did not melt through the grill as I had feared, but remained firm on the outside. Definitely making this again, and this time for company!

I added some sugar to the marinade because I thought it was a bit too sour for my taste. It is simple to bbq. The romaine is still crunch after you bbq it. Kids loved it.

I made this for friends from Cyprus and they were impressed with the grilled romaine. However, they had me cook the cheese in a pan with a light coat of butter. I think they were scared of the beloved cheese falling thru the grill rack. It was a success and the first time they had Haloumi served on top of a salad.

This is delicious. I have had grilled romaine out at a restaurant but never tried it at home. My guests were amazed that the lettuce was grilled.

I've made this salad a few times now, pretty much as written. It's got a nice balance of flavors, and the grilled romaine is really great. I had never considered grilling lettuce! I love halloumi!
