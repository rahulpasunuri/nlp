This was a good recipe. I used 1 lb of Tilapia and added some lemon to the mix as well as an egg because otherwise I'm not sure the patties would have stayed together. I'll definitely make these again but I think I'll actually puree a small portion of the fish to help bind the mixture together because even with the egg they fell apart a little. I made sure to put a full packed 1/4 cup of each of the herbs and thought the cakes were plenty flavorful. I also made a quicker horseradish sauce with sour cream, mayo, lemon juice and parsley and served them over horseradish mashed potatoes. My husband and I both went back for seconds.

These are terrific! I prepare the Seder every year for Passover for my Jewish in-laws and, though they love Gefilte Fish, I do not. These are a great complement to the meal and everyone in my husband's family devours them (along with the Gefilte fish). For the 2 of us who don't eat the GF, these are delicious! Make the sauce 1 day ahead so the flavors really can meld and use fresh horseradish if you can.

To the Australian asking about different fish... what you are looking for is a white-flesh fish that is more meaty (i.e. not light and flaky). For example, your Barramundi or Murray cod is probably too flaky. An Australian Bass is probably a good choice.

I looked up fishcakes to use up some left over trout (cooked) and a salmon fillet (raw) I had in the fridge. Used this recipe as a guideline really and it turned out great. I did add an egg and a chopped green chili but all in all this was a great basic recipe.

These were devoured by my guests as soon as I cooked a new batch. So easy, I didn't add cilantro or parsley, but a small amount of fresh oregano. Will make again!

I used halibut. These were OK but not great. They looked very attractive but were a bit bland for my taste. On the other hand, the blandness was a good foil for the accompanying green horseradish sauce. I may experiment with other chopped herbs and perhaps some citrus zest and/or minced scallions in place of some of the red onions. They are a good option if you're looking for a susbstitute for gefilte fish at Passover, as even the non-gefilte fish eaters ate them. So the fact that they are innocuous may not be so bad.

This was really easy and very healthy. I cut the recipe in half twice to serve two people to get 4 cakes. If you have a gas stove, 3 minutes one side and 2 on the other at med heat worked well. I served it with the horserasidh sauce but added 1/ 2 a packet of splenda to kill the acidity. Served the first course with individual Blue Cheese Soufflés and Rocket Tomato Salad. Then the cakes & sauce with basmatti rice cooked in chicken broth tossed with braised butter leek slices & fresh cooked corn kernels. The sweet & spice worked well. Dessert was small lemon tartlet with almond shortbread crust with strawberries & almond buttermilk sorbet. Serve the sauce smeared on the plate and not on the fishcakes as it may be too strong for some.

I make these frequently for Shabbat dinner in place of gefilte fish (which I don't particularly care for). I always get rave reviews and I suspect many of my guests look forward to dinner at my home particularly because of these fish cakes. I also make the Tunisian fish cakes on this web site and they are equally good.

I also used Tilapia - the result was great. Went really well with the horseradish sauce ... a very big hit at the seder dinner. Would definitely make again.

Very good! I couldn't find striped bass so I used 1/2 black cod and 1/2 tilapia, which worked well. Will definitely make these again, perhaps for a gourmet Seder.
