I was looking for a cold seafood platter -- something different than the usual shrimp cocktail -- and this was perfect. Very easy to make with cleaned squid. I could not find the chile puree specified, but used Franks hot sauce (mild) and a few drops of Blair's "After Death" sauce (very hot). The finished dish is nicely flavored with the citrus, cilantro, and a little chile heat at the end. The shrimp, scallops, and squid were cooked just right at the timing given by the recipe. I served it in one large shallow bowl without much of the marinade. After two more days of marinating in the fridge the leftovers were still fresh and tasty.
