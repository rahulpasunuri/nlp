I wanted to have a warm carrot soup, so I used this as a base and modified it slightly. I made 2 1/2 batches and omitted the lime juice because I don't care for it in general. For both I tripled the amount of curry powder. For one batch I added a tablespoon of brown sugar, and to the other I added a teaspoon each of cayenne and cumin. Both versions are delicious:-) Next time I'll try roasting the carrots first to give it more depth.

Added 2 cups of sweet potato, a teaspoon of sweet paprika and a dash of cinnamon. We used water instead of chicken broth and it was fine. Used coconut water instead of coconut milk. skipped the ice water part, put it in the fridge for a bit. Great recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly except for adding a bit more lime juice. Used a dollop of greek style yogurt topped with minced scallions to garnish. Lovely and refreshing on a hot day. Thank you Epicurious!

Just a lovely soup. Easy to make and flexible (we didn't have quite enough carrots, so I added a lone zucchini and corn from the previous night's grilling) and very tasty. I was a bit generous with curry, ginger, and lime - but we like things well spiced in our home. Also added a bit of cayenne as our curry powder wasn't hot.

lovely. followed the recipe with substituting dollop of yogurt and chopped cilantro for garnish. also added some cayenne at end as it needed more zip. my guests loved this starter. next time will use more madras or change to more flavorful curry powder as it needed a tad more flavor. do try it, you won't be disappointed as the coconut milk makes it creamy. will try the toasted coconut garnish too.

Excellent! Not too spicy, easy to serve. Perfect for a ladies' luncheon.

I thought this was great! It was my first time pureeing something and I thought the texture was lovely. Solid flavors, too! I was irked by the 1 to 1 1/2-cup range for coconut milk because I didn't have any instincts to rely on, but I think it worked out. I've eaten it both hot and cold and I think the coconut flavor comes out better when it's cold.

This was an interesting recipe. Looking back, I realize that I used WAY too much curry powder. I served mine cold with a dollop of plain yogurt and some fresh cilantro. I will try it next time warm.

I can't express with words how good this soup is! I followed the recipe exactly. The consistency is thick, which I like, so I did not thin with ice water. This was a big hit with my friends - one of whom wants to buy a food processor so he can make it himself! I served the soup warm, garnished with toasted unsweetened coconut flakes, as another reviewer suggested - sublime!

The soup is delishious! I added a little extra curry powder, and about 1/8t paprika. The coconut made it very smooth.i would highly recomend it.

This soup is great cold or hot. I get raves every time I make it. Complex flavors blend into a perky, satisfying soup that is a great starter.

OK... This is an easy and totally delicious soup. I used a good quality of Garam Masala powder instead of that non original cheap curry powder and it gave my soup a new dimension. It smells and tastes great!!! I also used good fresh, sweet carrots and homemade chicken broth. Its great both warm and cold. I did not thin it with additional water.I will definitely cook it again!

This was pretty tasty. At the end, I felt like it needed more greenery, so I added some cilantro, and it really perked things up.

Tried this soup out on my husband before making it for a luncheon. Served it to him both hot and cold..."DON"T lose this recipe!" was his review. My friends all requested the recipe. I thought the texture was great. Complex flavors make this a winning recipe (and its rather easy). I did not thin the soup and garnished with toasted coconut. Try it...you'll like it!

With the weather heating up I've been experimenting with cold soups. This is a very tasty soup, nice combination of ginger and carrots and curry. I'm not completely sold on the texture. I will try straining it when I prepare it again. Next...

I made this soup to take on a picnic. It was perfect. Got rave reviews. Fabulous taste and easy to make. I added about 2 T of lime by the time I was finished.

In case you're wondering why I called it a "vegan" soup -- I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock as I'm vegan and always on the lookout for recipes that are both fabulous and made without meat and milk products. I also used olive oil instead of butter. I've had a soup like this at a vegan restaurant where they used sweet potatoes (a.k.a. yams) instead of carrots and it was divine.

A sumptuous, easy vegan soup. Made it to take to a potluck in the dog days of summer. I didn't have green onions or lime so I substituted cooking onions and lemon juice and it turned out just fine.

Wow! facile à faire et succulente à souhait! Easy to do and very tasty! On mangerait tout le chaudron dès la première fois. À refaire absolument!

Very good soup. Easy too. Added a pinch of sugar and cayenne and the extra lime juice really perked up the flavors.

This was excellent. Don't substitute a thing, as it comes out perfectly. It's easy to make too! It is going to be in my "favourite" section.

Excellent soup! Best carrot soup I have had. It is tastey hot in the cooler months, and refreshing with lime in the warmer months! Very easy to make slicing carrots in a food processor, and using a wand blender to puree. My company couldn't get over how wonderful it was.

Very tasty soup. Ate it warm cause I was hungry. Also added heat and garlic like some others. Texture was a bit grainy but that could be my blender. Perhaps if I strained it next time. . .Didn't have chix stock to used water and was still good.

I've made this twice. I LOVE it. I use to work in the kitchen at Lake Austin Spa Resort and it reminded me of some of their cold summer soups. It's absolutely delicious. As a garnish, I used cilantro instead of the green onion.......I hate when people change the recipes but cilantro is just easier on my stomach. I like to serve it in a martini glass. YUMMY

Turned out very good. I prefer it hot, and you really have to use good-quality curry powder because the flavor is very noticable.

I've made this soup many times and have always had rave reviews. I make it hot and add garlic for a bit more punch. Beautiful colour and great flavour!

Wonderful! It's important to use a good-quality curry powder, or the flavor will taste flat/stale. A great make-ahead recipe for a weeknight dinner party, and also worked well for an afternoon picnic.

Fantastic flavor. I think it is great warm or cold (I've made it a few times already!) It was particularly good with a dollop of thick plain yogurt.

A bit predictable and idn't seem to have the layers of flavor I was expecting. So-So and as I have a bit left over I will try slightly warmed.

I made this for a dinner party last night and served it a room temperature. Everyone claimed to love it, although I found the texture to be a bit thick, even after I thinned it with some chicken stock. It is a very easy make-ahead dish.

My guests loved this soup. They emptied their bowls. I personally did not like the texture but I am not a cold soup lover. We did have to thin the soup. I suggest you use both coconut milk and water, not just water, as that will dilute the flavors a bit too much. Oh, we used vegetable boullion, not chicken broth, as we were feeding potential vegetarians.

This is one of my standby recipes. Serving at roomtemp is better than cold, but I also like to heat it and add chicken and grated zucchini or whatever for texture.

I love carrot soups, and I love cooking with cumin and coconut milk, but somehow these flavors together, and cold, didn't work for me. It was somewhat more to my taste when it was room temperature than chilled, but still not great. For me this didn't work.
