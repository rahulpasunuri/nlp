The garlic is overpowering and completely overwhelms all the beautiful, fresh, organic vegetables I ruined by making this.

How could you call ginger, lime, jalepeno, etc. bland? I would recommend as good veggies to accompany an indian night.

I liked this very much. It's warm and comforting. I am making it again.

I like to try a recipe first before changing it around, but I don't think I'd bother trying to improve this. Very bland and disappointing.
