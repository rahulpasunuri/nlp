This is NOT rumaki. It is not a variation on rumaki unless you consider wrapping bacon around virtually anything "rumaki". Wrap it around courgette, aubergine, mushrooms...absurd! The original recipe from Don the Beachcomber's is listed on this very site. That is rumaki.This is just pineapple with bacon.

This has inspired a whole list of faux-maki for us! Our friends own a date farm & I'm thinking about doing a bacon wrapped date stuffed with a gorgonzola.This is just the start of a perfect pool party menu we will be doing in the Desert next weekend--fabulous mid century entertaining fun stuff to do instead of trying to outdo the pan-asian or tuscan thing! GO maki!Do variations!

No forks. This is NOT Rumaki, it's pineapple wraped in bacon. I put it in the category of pineapple on pizza-Bleech!

OK, so it's not a classic "rumaki". It's just a cute, easy, retro Brini-style "homage" to Rumaki. And it's yummy. BTW - I broiled it for eight minutes and finished in a 375 oven for about ten, and the bacon came out perfectly crispy without gooey, rubbery fat. They were a big hit at my cocktail party this evening. Thanks, Brini!

I gave it one fork on my first review, but when I submitted it, an additional fork was added. Why?

Rumaki doesn't mean "wrapped in bacon." Pinepapple wrapped in bacon is not Rumaki any more than Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon.

This is absolutely not rumaki. Rumaki is chicken livers wrapped in bacon - not scallops, not olives, not onions, and certainly not pineapple. Why anyone would want to do this to such a succulent morsel as fresh pineapple, I cannot imagine. I have yet to serve a plate of plain, fresh pineapple and had a single piece leftover. Some things are best left unadulterated.

If you change a recipe so much that it doesn't resemble the dish, please change the name. This is as much rumaki as apple pie would be without the apples.

One of our all time favorites! Make sure you try wrapping the bacon around sweet onion slices, water chestnust, and/or green olives as well as the pineapple.

It should be called 'Hawaiians on Horseback'.

How can you call this Rumaki? Where's the chicken liver and the Japanese soy sauce? This is a dumbed-down recipe if I ever saw one!

This looks great. We used to make them with bacon and water chestnuts. Also, we put a honey-teriaki sauce on them when they broiled to sweeten up the bacon (since we were not using pineapple. I think the pineapple will be refreshing. Might still add a bit of teriaki to it.
