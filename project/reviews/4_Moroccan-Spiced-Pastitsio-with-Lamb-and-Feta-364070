Just ate a piece of this that had been in the freezer for a few months. Still o good. Made with ground chicken. I probably won't make this again because the kids didn't like it but I sure did!

This was fabulous! Followed recipe as written. A fairly big clean up, but really worth it. I made it a day ahead and reheated, covered, to serve company. Impressive and delicious.

p.s. Used the recipe for ras el hanout provided by another reviewer below.

Had to make a bunch of substitutions because of ingredient availability: 14 oz can diced tomatoes and small can of tomato puree (no tomato paste); ground turkey instead of lamb; Asiago rather than parmesan. I had an opened container of crumbled feta -- maybe 5 oz rather than 6, so it's my fault that the sauces wasn't as cheesy as I would've liked. Wish I'd made 1/2 a recipe, though -- I thought this would fit in a souffle dish. That was just big enough for the 4 c penne and the meat sauce. Transferred to a 13x9x2 to be able to fit everything in and it was filled to the brim.

Loved this, as did the rest of the family. I halved it and there was enough for the three of us plus lots of leftovers. I was able to go from start to oven in an hour, so about 1 3/4 hours total. It's solid comfort food with just a little exotic edge from the ras el hanout. Highly recommended.

Excellent recipe. Will make again. Just be sure to leave enough time. NOT a quick meal to prepare and it left a mess in my kitchen, but well worth it!

This is a heart attack on a plate, but what a way to go! There are several recipes for ras-el-hanout on the web plus one on Epicurious that worked fine for me.

The recipe is less daunting than appears. I suggest you make your own ras-el-hanout (Google the recipe).

Comfort food. Heavy. Delicious. Fattening. If you're on a diet, this isn't the dish for you. However, my boyfriend and picky teenage boys loved it. I would definitely make it again with a little less cinnamon. Serve with a salad. I used the Ras-el-hanout recipe from one of the reviewers and it was great. It wasn't dry at all (use the juice from the canned tomatoes). Very delicious.

Excellent! Made with turkey instead of lamb. I also made it ahead and froze it, so it was a quick-fix dinner. Very tasty!

Recommend making your own ras-el- hanout; better than storebought and easy. Lots of ingredients but all easy to find: 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 2 teaspoons ground coriander 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons ground ginger 2 teaspoons turmeric 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon cardamom powder 1 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves Just mix them all together in a small bowl. And save the leftovers!

SO GOOD! Non-boring combos of ingredients, perfect blend of slightly exotic spices, really not tricky to make but one hour prep time? Took me two afternoons. Not complaining, just don't plan on whipping it up the afternoon of your party.

Crazy good. Decent amount of steps/multi-tasking involved, but the result is absolutly phenomenal. I messed up & used a 13.5 oz box of whole wheat penne instead of a pound, so I withheld a bit of the sauce & béchamel for a later small batch of pasta. Used a smaller dish, layered as directed, baked about 26 min at 400*, turned off the oven for the last 4-5 minutes, then let stand at room temp. Nothing in the meal required special technique, just several things going on at once to make an absolutly fantastic meal - even for one who doesn't usually care for lamb.

Wow delicious! Not too many steps and nothing hard. Not particularly healthy but so yummy! Was fun to try some new spices and meat!

This is like OMG Good. I love the spices. I made my own ras-el-hanout. Recipes for the spice blend are easy enough to find online. The recipe I used along with the additional cinnamon in the main recipe, made it a little heavy on the cinnamon side so you might watch out for that.

Wonderful comfort meal. This dish is one we discussed the 3 or 4 rating. We always air on the conservative side but could have gone to 4 forks. This is a fun dish to make but make sure you have the time. It is a great marriage of ingredients. The house still smells wonderful. Follow the cooking times and you will not have a dry dish. We purchased the ras-el-hanout at our local Wegman's market. The brand was "kula" it might have been a bit more mild than others but give the dish the exotic favor one would expect. The cheese mixture was creamy and favorful. The result of careful preparation. We will most certainly make again and worthy of quests. guests.

The flavor of this dish is wonderful and exotic yet not extreme. I made it for a dinner party with guest whose tastes were unknown to me. The dish was a success. If anything, it was slightly on the dry side - do not let the meat sauce simmer any longer than 15 minutes. Next time I will add some extra diced tomatoes with the juice to add some extra moisture.

This dish was fantastic! The ras el hanout can be hard to find unless you have a halal meat or other Middle Eastern market in your area, but you can also make your own. There are a lot of different recipes out there for the spice so you may have to make an educated guess as to what will work best for your taste. There was a lot of work involved in making this dish, but it is well worth it! Very yummy and cheesy - great comfort food! I will definitely make this again!
