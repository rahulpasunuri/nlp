Don't forget with green beans, too. For a fancy presentation, I grate the yolk and white separately, then "stripe" the crumbs, yolk and white across the dish, toss at last minute. YUM. And pretty!

Excellent over steamed broccoli also;last minute thing as it gets cold fast; Push the egg through a strainer for a better look. Fry bacon bits for over the broccoli; prepare egg and bacon ahead time and keep room temp. brown bread crumbs last minute so they are hot. Its one of my old time favorites. Goes as a side with any meal!
