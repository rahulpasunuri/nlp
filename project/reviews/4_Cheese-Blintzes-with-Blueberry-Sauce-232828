This was perfect. I couldn't find farmers cheese this week so i made up the difference by using mostly additional large curd drained cottage cheese. Next time i will head to whole foods and get some famrers cheese to check out the difference. The filling was light and very flavorful. The crepe recipes was pretty close to perfect and the blueberry sauce made with local Connecticut blueberries was awesome. My wife who has found memories of blintz from NYC delis and has ordered them from many local resturants and always considered what she got to be second rate at best, considered these to be nirvana . Oops now I need to add these to my breakfast repretorie along with homemade English muffins which were so mu superior to anything store bought.

I love this recipe with fresh ricotta and a tsp of lemon zest. I usually don't bother with the blueberry sauce, but instead spoon a tsp of homemade raspberry jam on top. Unbelievable.

Do not use this filling! It is tasteless, dry and heavy as lead! The blintzes themselves are good, creating a sturdy crepe that will take a filling well. Just not this filling!

I made some small changes to this recipe which may have affected the taste of the filling. I don't know what farmer cheese is and didn't see it at Safeway so used 1 cup Quark and 1 cup cottage cheese instead. I didn't find this filling nearly as flavorful as another recipe I had used in the past which had more sugar and was flavored with vanilla. For the crêpes I used less flour because the more flour you use the thicker the pancake and 1 1/2 cups flour to 1 1/2 cups milk makes it the pancake that is too thick for what I consider a good crêpe. I was very happy with the way they turned out. The blueberry sauce is good and the taste of it will depend on the quality of blueberries you use. I would make the sauce and the crêpes again but not this filling.

I have made these several times always with great feedback. Excellent addition to any brunch and easy enough for any morning breakfast.

Almost perfect blintz recipe however- the bleitlach(crepes) should have more salt to balance the sweetness of the cheese. For a lump free batter first add the flour to the beaten eggs, then the milk and salt, whisk til smooth. When rolling the cheese should be off center, fold top, bottom then roll like an egg roll- cheese side first.

good recipe, but the folding is wrong: bottom up first, then the sides, then fold the top down. this holds them together and makes a neat package.

Great recipe! These are what you'd expect from a good Jewish Deli. Several times I've used ricotta cheese for the farmers cheese and they turned out really well!

These were very easy, very tasty and even my 3 yo. ate them.

I was afraid this recipe would be too fussy for me, but other than planning ahead to let the batter rest, it was very easy to make, and delicous. Even my oldest, picky-eater son who's 7 liked it. A definite "repeater" in our house!

These were definitely the best blintzes I ever tasted. I bought local Sonoma Farmer cheese, which made these blintzes extra rich tasting.
