I added cranberries to the apples and pecans in this recipe, and closely followed the directions. Instead of a large loaf pan, I made the breads in smaller pans and shortened the baking time. I was surprised that the breads did not rise at all; they were flat on top. My baking powder is recent. I wonder if baking soda should be added?

Yummy! I used walnuts, brown sugar and 1T of ginger since I don't like cinnamon. I think my apples were too big so next time I'll chopped them up a bit more. I also thought of adding cheddar!

Delish! No OJ so used pineapple juice and added some vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove then sprinkled brown sugar on top for a sweet crunchy top. Perfect. Used red delicious apples and chopped them not grated as some others suggested. Love how the baking made my whole house smell so good. So easy and will make again!

This is a hit around my home. Great way to use apples from the orchard. Sometimes, I add cinnamon and nutmeg. Most recently, I left out the spices and added raisins in addition to the pecans. It was great with the raisins.

The first time I made this I used the suggestions for additional spices and brown sugar and used Egg Beaters instead of eggs. The bread came out well, but didn't keep well -- after a couple of days it was really soggy and starting to taste spoiled. This time around I made a few more changes, to lower the fat and try to decrease the sogginess. The bread came out great (my husband said even better this time), and I'm hoping that refrigerating it will help it keep longer. Here're the ingredients for my new version of the recipe: DRY - 1 3/4 c. flour; 1/2 c. brown sugar; 1 T. baking powder; 1/2 t. salt; 2 t. cinnamon; 1/2 t. nutmeg; 1/4 t. ground cloves. WET - 1/4 c. maple syrup; 2/3 c. orange juice; 1/6 c. (1/3 stick) melted unsalted butter; 1/2 c. Egg Beaters; 1 t. vanilla. FOLD IN - 2 medium Granny Smith apples, grated and pressed in a strainer to extract water; 1/2 c. chopped pecans.

I will have to try this with apples. I just had asian pears and adjusted the higher moisture content by adding about 1/4c more flour. I also used the brown sugar/maple syrup combination and added 2t cinnamon and 1/2t nutmeg. I have had good results in making quick breads by cutting in Earth Balance spread into the flour mix and then folding in the wet ingrediants. It took a lot longer to bake and wished I had used the convection option to help dry out the bread. I think I baked it for 80 minutes! However, it was nice and moist and the top was crisp and delicious. Sugaring the top would have made it even better.

Very good, I followed the suggestion of others and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, but otherwise followed the recipe. The bread was moist, flavorful and my family loved it. We will definitely make again.

I am not a baker but we had so many apples around the house, so I made this recipe. I also added cinnamon and cardamom and used light brown sugar. Only had cranberry juice so substituted for orange. Got rave reviews from my partner and his office when he brought leftovers in the next day. His coworkers said I should open a bakery!

After reading reviews, I decided to replace the sugar with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of maple syrup. Added 1 tsp of cinamon. Delicious.

I used: blood orange juice, 2 Fuji apples (chopped roughly into matchsticks) and toasted pecans. I baked it for about 45 min. at 350 in a 9x9 pan; rotating once. It was very moist and tasted like apples. Just what I wanted! I'll make this again!

I was glad I read the reviews before trying this recipe.... I thought it odd that it did not call for any spices. After adding 1 tsp. each of vanilla extract and cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. each of nutmeg and allspice, I still found it to be bland. My husband, who is extremely picky, surprised me by saying he liked it. If I make it again, I will increase the spices and will perhaps substitute brown sugar for the regular sugar to see if that gives it a richer flavor. I substituted walnuts for pecans and would do so again.

This was good - meriting the two forks. I would honestly give the recipe as it is less than that though - my husband and I added copious amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to perk up the flavour and it was still nothing outstanding. It would be mighty bland without any spices. Nice texture though.

I doubled this, added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla per others' suggestions, baked in 6 mini loafs (the 2x recipe) for 45min @ 350, and breads were gorgeous, tasty, and perfectly moist.

Came out like a heavy, damp sponge. Had to put it in for 60 mins b/c the middle top was very soupy at the reco. baking time. I used a variety of apples and shredded them (with peel on). No unique flavor. Nothing really redeeming about this recipe.

While making breakfast this morning we realized that we did not have any bread. Trying to avoid biscuits we settled for trying this recipe after reading a few of the reviews. We substituted walnuts for the pecans because that is what we had on-hand and added 1 tbs. of cinnamon. It was delicious! The bread was very moist and not too sweet. The apples and walnuts provided great flavors throughout every bite.

First of all, I used only about a tablespoon and a half of butter, substituting apple sauce for the rest. I also used apple juice simply because I didn't happen to have orange on hand, and I reduced the sugar because I figured apple juice is sweeter than orange. I also added a dash of cinnamon. Even with all of these substitutions, the cake would have turned out divine, had I not made one rookie mistake (due to being a blind klutz, i think) and used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose. As it so happened, my quickbread had a bit too much leavening and tasted salty/baking soda-ish, but still pretty good to the non-discerning (like my husband). I am giving this recipe three forks because of its great potential and will report back when I make it again.

This is a very good quick bread. I also added some spice though; 1 t. cinnamon, 1 t. nutmeg, and 1/2 t. allspice. I also eliminated the oj and instead added 1/3 c. of apple sauce and 1/3 c. of water, and instead of chopping the apples I grated them. The latter two modifications made it more moist.

followed recipie,but did add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Still a little dull. Fit perfect in 3 mini loaf pans-cooked at 350 for 40 minutes. Not gooey and not dry-Just right.

This was really tasty. At the last minute, discovered that I didn't have OJ, so used apple juice. Reduced the sugar slightly to 2/3 cup. I chopped my apples and walnuts rather fine, as I was serving the bread to a group including toddlers. It says not to overbake, but my loaf came out kind of gooey in the center. Most of the loaf was perfect, though!

You must add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, it added depth to the flavor. I also used fresh oj and chopped the apples, they were just the right size. I baked the bread for just under 50 minutes and it is fabulously moist. Do not over bake-and it will not be crumbly. Excellent recipe.

used grated golden delicious, and diced granny smith to give some textural variety. also added some cinnamon and clove (would have added nutmeg and ginger as well if i had any, but was unfortunately out). this turned out delicious, with a great apple flavor, and moist texture. very easy too.

I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to this bread and it came out with a great flavor and a good moist texture. My only complaint is that the sides of the loaf were dry and crumbly, but i think this was because i baked it in a glass loaf pan (next time will use metal). I think it would work well with grated apples instead of chopped. will try it next time. a good alternative for when i don't want to make banana bread or don't have any ripe bananas!

I added cinnamon and nutmeg, and I used 4 small apples. I'll definitely make this again. Just like mom's.

This was incredibly easy to make and a flexible recipe. I made a loaf for my coworkers, for whom I like to make quickbreads, and they all raved that it was the best bread I've ever made. I hadn't thought it was that amazing, but maybe my palatte is more discerning than theirs...!

I thought this was good, though a little bland -- I'll try it again (have to -- went apple picking this weekend and picked a ton of apples!) but this time I think I will add a few more spices, as suggested by others, and some more pecans, too.

I replaced butter with applesauce, added 1 tsp cinnamon, and used half wheat flour. Came out great!

This bread has great potential! I agree with other reviewers to add the cin. (1 tsp.). I also changed the butter to canola oil, and upped the apples to 3 cups. YES, this recipe is TOO LARGE for a standard loaf pan. I used the Pampered Chef 4 loaf stone, and it fits perfectly!

I made this recipie as stated and did not presift the flour prior to measuring. I did not have any problems with crumbliness and slicing the bread. I used Fuji apples instead of Golden's and I ground the pecans for a more even taste. I thought it tasted good. I have tried it with other vaiations of juices and liked it best with cran-raspberry.

I used hazelnuts and McIntosh apples; I also added cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. It was a little crumbly - the next time I make it I will remove it from the pan to cool, and I'll bump up the spices a bit. Overall, delicious, easy & a crowd pleaser!

I hosted a continental breakfast for a meeting of sewing enthusiasts. Among the attendee's were fashion designers and many home economics teachers. Everyone who was lucky enough to get a slice asked for the recipe (and another slice). I used Granny Smith apples, added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and dusted the top of the bread with finely chopped pecans.

Wonderful. I substituted walnuts for the pecans and Braeburns for the Golden Delicious since that's what I had on hand. I also added a bit of nutmeg and contrary to other experiences, this bread is nice and golden outside, moist on the inside. Be sure to follow the flour rules and don't scoop straight from the bag or pack the flour into the cup. Sift into your measuring cup, instead, or at the very least shake and pour from the bag, otherwise you'll get twice the flour you are going for. Anyway, the bread has a nice tang from the OJ and I'll capitalize on that next time by throwing in some cranberries, as suggested. Smells heavenly, too. This one's a keeper.

I read all of the negative reviews and decided to try it anyway. I didn't have any orange juice, so I substituted cran-raspberry juice instead. Also used 1 cup of apple and 1/4 cup of fresh cranberries and toasted nuts. It turned out GREAT! I brought it to work and co-workers are raving. I'll try this again, but put a streusel on top for extra crunch.

We really enjoyed this bread. Not only did it turn out perfectly it tasted incredible with very little effort. We used apple cider instead of the OJ and had no problems with sourness. But it did crumble when sliced.

Have not yet made the bread. Remember, when you cook orange juice it turns sour. So if you want a sour taste go fot it, I am gonna try apple cider.

This is an excellent recipe. However, make sure you pre-sift the flour BEFORE you measure it out. If you don't, the bread will be too dry. I believe this is were many reviewers may have gone wrong. The recipe doesn't clarify this properly.

It's true. This bread is too crumbly to serve to guests reliably, but the unassertive flavor and pleasant texture are what will make me want to try it again for myself. I used assorted pears and apples left over from a fruit tray and substituted walnuts for the pecans. Next time, I think I'll get wild and add some cinnamon!

My family and I enjoyed this. It was somewhat sweet, but still good. It was a little crumbly but not too bad, I baked it in a square pan instead of a loaf pan, it came out fine, also I used the light margarine in it, it was also fine.

I added one-half cranberries and I enjoyed the tart flavor but it is still an extremely rich "quick bread". It was more like dessert. This bread took every bit of 55 minutes to cook. I think next time I will use 1/2 wheat flour to cut the sweetness some more. The bread did not hold together well upon slicing so toasting was not an option for me but my husband and I still thoroughly enjoyed it

This recipe should be named Apple Pecan Crumb Bread because that is what happens when you try to slice it. I followed the recipe exactly; however the recipe did not specify peeled or unpeeled apples. I used peeled; I doubt this would make enough of a difference in the bread's success. I tried this recipe first before ordering the book and I am glad if this is typical
