The recipe was followed with diligence and to my dismay the balls crumbled in front of me much like my dreams of having a delicious Arabic meal. Also, I find this recipe to be prejudice because my white skin could not create these little brown beauties. Thank you, have a good day, and Shalom.

Falafel is NOT "Israeli." It's Palestinian!

I made this exactly as written. Mine fell apart, also. I added an egg and a little panko, then they were ok.

I loved the smell and taste, however I found also that the balls fell apart in the oil. (thank goodness I just put one in to test!) So I did an UNauthentic thing and added a little flour and a bit of partially beaten egg to bind it together. It worked! I would lessen the amount of salt it calls for though as that was the first thing my husband commented on was the salty flavor.

I don't know anything about authenticity, but this was delicious. I soaked my chickpeas extra long and then let them sprout over a few days (rinsing twice daily). I added a little more chickpea because it tasted too much of onion for me (maybe I had too much onion). My patties stayed together perfectly. We just used a small layer of olive oil in the pan, rather than deep frying. Excellent. I will definitely do this again. So easy and delicious.

I have no idea why it is called Israeli Falafel, it is not Israeli, unless using canned chickpeas makes it so.

This recipe is fantastic. This was the closest I have come to the real thing which I had in Bethlehem. I followed the recipe exactly and there is no need for the flour providing you do the following; the falafels will not fall apart and will crisp beautifully: -Use dried chick peas (not canned) -Don't make them too big (about golf ball size is perfect, and authentic.) -Make sure your oil is hot enough to start frying immediately. -Lower balls gently into the oil on a spoon (don't drop in) -Don't turn or move till half cooked. I love it and will make it again. Perfect!

Okay...This recipe works! However....it will not work if you use canned chick peas. I don't know why it's even mentioned here....My first go-around was with canned chick pea and my results were like some of yours not desireable....So, I went out got a bag o'beans (chick pea) soaked'em over night and gave it another go. I will admit I was skeptical....but to my amazement the recipe works....no need for flour the starch present in the chick pea holds them together nicely and the crust that forms is crisp. This recipe is all that you would expect from some good Falafel...Delicious! Try it again and start with dried chick pea.

what a gloppy mess! Never made falafel before, followed recipe exactly, and it made some gross falafel.hot oil soup!!!!! I am totally not a novice cook, the patties looked wet, but I figured "oh well, that's what the recipe says to do...."

This is not the way authentic Middel Eastern falafel is made. This recipe has been altered on so many levels, it shouldn't even be called "falafel".

I used a half a cup of dried chickpeas. The first one fell apart, but after that, I hand packed them and they came out great!

Horrible! I should have read the other review before trying this recipe. What a waste of perfectly good food. The Falafels totally disintegrated when I tried to fry them.

This recipe is wrong!!! The flour is missing from the ingregient list and instructions. I learned this the hard way from a frying pan full of gloppy mess!
