I agree with everyone to halve the sugar. I grated my ginger on a microplane, and instead of orange zest I used lime zest and lime juice. The ginger and lime make it amazing! And I used half water/half orange-banana-strawberry juice.

This is as good as everyone says. Because of the raves I doubled the recipe so I could give some away. I am a major ginger fan so used double. Used half the sugar and substituted unfiltered apple juice for the water.

I've been making this for the past 3 years. I reduce the sugar by half, substitute the water with syrup from canned Mandarin oranges, and add in the Mandarin oranges at the end. Although I haven't tried it, I'm thinking adding in some chopped candied ginger would kick it up some.

This recipe is so easy and SO delicious I almost had to arm-wrestle my mom for the leftovers last Thanksgiving! Im sure you could use less sugar and more oj,if you like, its just about foolproof.My family liked it so much I'll make it Every holiday!

2 cups of sugar? I made this with 2 bags of cranberries, 1 cup of OJ, one cup of wine and half a cup of apple juice. I also threw in a diced, peeled granny smith apple. It was almost too sweet, even with just 2 cups of sugar. Try using half and see what you think. I know cranberries are tart, but that much sugar is an overkill

My husband and niece eat this sauce by the spoonful! I tripled the recipe with a fraction of the sugar. Making another triple batch two days after Thanksgiving... Complete hit! A friend who has been told by doctor she can't have any more coffee or Diet Coke uses the sauce to make tea.

Sounds great, but would I really want to refridgerate this for 3 months?

we've made this a few times, always to good reception. extremely easy to make. we actually use two oranges worth of zest and juice, no water. added chopped walnuts to the mix for a bit of texture for thanksgiving and made an excellent addition.

I have tried this receipe for a few years and it is great! I use no water but a whole cup of orange juice.
