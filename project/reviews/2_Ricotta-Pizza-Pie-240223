Okay, the dough is rubbish, however this is such a great pizza pie. I use Nigella Lawson's recipe for the crust (Pizza Rustica on her website), and the filling of this recipe. Taste great at room temp.

I found this recipe to be a disaster. Firsdt of all the dough was not workable with the amount of water called for and then the crust turned out tough and not at all tasty! I would never make this again!!

I made this in a springform and it worked quite well. As for the taste, I'm not quite sold. It was dryer and saltier than I expected. Perhaps I overcooked it, though I took it out after 50 minutes. Also, the crust is quite dry and salty. I don't think I would make this again.

I'm confused on type of pan to use. Picture shows spring form pann but directions call for a pie plate.
