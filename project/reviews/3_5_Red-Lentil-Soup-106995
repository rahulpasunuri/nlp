I found this quite satisfying. I made some minor changes. I substituted some leeks I had in the freezer for the celery, and used only 4 cups cooking liquid, since my husband was very adamant about wanting a thick soup (4 cups water and 1 vegetable bouillon cube). It wasn't too thick but just a good soup I think. I added a but of argan oil to mine. In the future I might add other spices to the cooking process, but it was fine as is.

This was very good. I didn't have tomatoes, so I used a bit of pasta sauce; also substituted turmeric for the cumin.

Love this recipe. I always add more veggies depending on whats in my fridge. Cauliflower is my favorite addition, it adds great texture. I also use all chicken broth instead of water and add cayenne pepper for a little spice. I use regular lentils as well and it tastes great!

This was quite good given how easy it is. Only adaptations were fire roasted tomatoes (too lazy to go to basement to get plain) and added some turkey kielbasa at the end.

So yum! I added some extra lentils to thicken it up and extra red chili flakes. Once dished up into bowls, I added some arugula. It doesn't need it, but but my boyfriend added a dollop of sour cream once in his bowl, and loved it.

This is a fantastic base to play with. Normally I make a recipe "as is" at least once but I've made so many kinds of lentil soup, I feel I have carte blanche creative license. With that in mind I used the basic outline of the recipe but made the following modifications: 1. I used vegetable bullion instead of chicken broth 2. I used a version I make of Chinese 5-spice powder (basically I just omit the anise and use cayenne pepper instead of Sichuan pepper) and 3. I added turkey-fennel meatballs. Delicious!

This was unexpectedly fantastic. I combined 2 red lentil soup recipes (Gourmet, Sept. 2002 & Oct. 2007) with slight modification. I started with this one, but used 2T olive oil (instead of 1-1/2T); 4 cloves garlic (instead of 3); 1 C chopped celery (instead of 1 rib); 1-1/2 teaspoons mild curry powder (instead of 1-1/4 teaspoons cumin); most of the liquid (about 5-1/2 of 6-1/2 cups) was a tasty homemade chicken broth (which may have made a huge difference); 1 bay leaf; and closer to 1-1/4 C red lentils. I pureed about 3 C of the soup and mixed it back in, which gave a nice texture overall -- a smooth base, but with discernible lentils, carrots & celery. Probably the best soup I've ever made.

I followed suggestions of other readers with regard to adding some cumin, coriander, garam masala and ginger. When I served the soup, I added some soy sauce to my bowl to give it a bit of tang. Finished off the soup nicely.

The best lentil soup I've made! Reduced cumin to !/4 tsp and increased tomatoes to 1 cup and it was so good. I pureed some for my 8 month old and she was mmmming and mmming as she ate it.

Perfect soup! I added 2 t of ras al hanout (a Moroccan spice blend) and 1/2 t ginger. I also used water instead of chicken broth to keep it cheap and vegetarian. Totally delicious, especially with a little harissa drizzled in my bowl.

This soup is fantastic. PLENTY of flavor. I think the key is to make sure that you onions cook long enough to turn golden. I added a bit of salt to the onions to make sure this was the case. It is the sweetness of the onion, combined with the butteryness (new word) of the cumin that really make this dish. I did use broth instead of water. Get a good quality broht - I used Trader Joe's. My red lentils were really small and broke apart in 20 minutes (my bad for not checking) so I decided to puree the soup. Delicious. Give this soup a chance!

I was surprised at how good this was. I thought it would be bland but it wasn't. My only adjustments were minor: 1. I followed the advice of others who said to use all broth instead of water. 2. Added 1/2 to 2/3 cup whole wheat couscous at the very end. (Add more liquid to the soup if you do this.) 3. A couple dashes of cayenne in addition to black pepper; just enough to give it zing but not be spicy. 4. And a good couple squeezes of lemon at the very end. The cumin gives it a warm, almost buttery flavor. And I love how the carrots don't get mushy (one of the reasons I usually don't care much for soups). They still had some firm crunch to them since the cooking was only 20 min. Loved that texture. This was a great way for me to get my fiber and my protein in one meal. A lovely soup.

After reading the review, I substituted all the liquid for broth. My boyfriend does not like lentils but he liked it so much he didn't have room left for the main course. My picky 2-year old liked it too, which makes it a definite keeper.

Lentil soup is wonderful on a cold winter day -- but this soup works well throughout the year. I usually make the soup as-written in this recipe, but sometimes add more garlic, sometimes eat it rustically without pureeing, and sometimes puree it completely. The lentils tend to fall apart for me anyway so pureeing smooths the texture. You may need to add more stock if you puree the soup. Sometimes needs additional salt. Serve with some crusty bread and a green salad and you will have happy eaters!

Just made it for my week's lunches. The boyfriend came, drooling, into the kitchen begging for a bowl, and he hates lentils (finding lentil recipes he likes is always a great victory for me)! Soooo wonderfully easy. I didn't even read any of the suggestions (in fact i didn't really read the actual instructions, just threw all the ingredients into a pot and boiled) but will probably play around with them in the future because i can tell i will be coming back to this one. I did puree the soup completely, because i prefer pureed soups to stewlike ones.

Very bland when made as directed. I added diced red pepper, used veggie broth instead of chicken, and left out the water. Still bland, so I added Tony's seasoning, greek seasoning, basil, more garlic and a lot more salt and pepper and its was amazing. Will make again, but with the tweaking....

Extremely easy, healthy and fun to tweak. I used fresh Roma tomatoes, and added fresh ginger, turmeric, cayenne,adding cilantro and fresh lemon juice after cooking.

I made this with the chive and parsley mashed potatoes on this site. I tossed a scoop of the potatoes in a bowl and then this. It really does need the salt and pepper at the end to bring the flavors out, but that was the key. I usually read the reviews and tweak things, and was concerned with the paucity of spices. But it tasted fine once I added the salt to wake up the flavors. My mashed potato idea was just to make this a veggie main course with some substance, and in the end it worked. I didn't have the red lentils, but I have to think this combo would make legit holiday fare if you have a red and green holiday in your future.

Just made this recipe and the taste is fabulous. Used a colourful lentil mixture, making soup look attractive as soups go. Picking up on other reviews, I doubled up on garlic, cumin and canned tomotoes, which I smashed. Also added coriander and used only chicken stock, 6 cups in all. Added bit of salt and pepper at the end. Didn't feel the need for wine as taste was complete without it. I'm fussy about what I cook and can promise you all that this one is big on flavour.

This was a delicious basic red lentil soup recipe which can be easily changed to make it ones own. I was out of cumin so I used a tablespoon of homemade garam masala spice mix...delicious. Next time I might try it with curry. I definately do aggree that the liquid percentage is off in this recipe. I used a 4-cup carton of chicken stock and allowed that to cook for 20 minutes with the other ingredients. The lentils weren't completely done, however, so I added a cup of plain water and let it cook for 15 minutes more. The consistancy was perfect. I also used a little more salt and pepper than the recipe called for and added a tablespoon of "spike" seasoning, but like I said this is a great basic recipe easy to make into your own creation. Cheers!

The one change I made to this recipe was I switched the chicken broth and water amounts, I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups of water. The flavor improved tremendously. Also a trick from my local lebanese restaurant that serves this: serve a slice of lemon on the side and squeeze in just before eating. A wonderful accent that raises this recipe to 4 forks.

I made this last night with cornbread on the side. I've never had a lentil soup before, but I enjoyed it a lot. I did not add parsley (didn't have it). Very good, and at least as good the next day (maybe better).

This recipe is identical to Sara Moulton's. I saw her demonstrate it on her show on the Food Network many years ago. I have made it many times and shared her recipe with the "foodies" in my life. I think of it as a great summer soup or light dinner with biscuits and a salad. I've added cubes of ham to enrich it, but it is not meant to be a hearty heavy wintry lentil soup. A dash of lemon juice and fresh parsley really make the dish.

I have tried several red lentil soup recipes and this is by far the best. As suggested, I flipped the water/broth ratio. I also sprinkled in a dash of coriander with the cumin and added lemon juice while running the soup through the food processor (I prefer a creamier texture!) Wonderful!!

I skipped the water and made this recipe with 5-6 cups homemade vegetable broth -- a very tasty soup! (And so easy to prepare.)

I like this soup, but agree that the broth to water ratio should be higher. I used chicken stock I had frozen, which made the soup hearty. I used split red lentils - and they took longer to soften than anticipated. I also added some chard I had on hand. Overall, this is a nice winter soup that includes a good spectrum of veggies.

after reading other reviews, i added three small yellow-skinned potatoes, cubed; doubled the garlic and celery; switched the ratio of chicken broth to water; splashed almost a quarter-cup of red wine vinegar into the soup; and added three seeded, diced plum tomatoes in the last twenty minutes. hello, delicious! (note: my red lentils took a bit longer to soften than the recipe suggests.)

Quick and easy soup. A healthful and delicious way to get in your legumes and veggies. I'm sure you can add as many veggies as you like or sub them. A bowl of this before dinner is very filling and helps me eat less all night long.

Delicious and easy. I was aiming for a lentil soup I used to get at a middle eastern restaurant in Southern California... and this is pretty darn close. the only things I changed were to flip the broth and water quantities (I was using up a box of broth, so I probably used 3 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water (though I'm sure a good vegetable broth would work just as well). I added a seeded diced plum tomato at the end of cooking rather than before. I also added a shake of ground coriander to the cumin. Serve this with a lemon wedge - this little touch absolutely makes the soup. This can be done in practically no time for a light weeknight dinner with a salad.

I add lots of different vegies depending what is in the fridge. Also add a little more cummin. I then freeze it and eat if for lunch all week.

I actually combined the two Epicurious red lentil soup recipe ingredients (the other is "Red Lentil Soup and Spiced Oil" but I didn't make/use the oil) and used the average between the 2 when the same ingredient listed. I added a total of 5 cups of broth. I also added a half teaspoon of salt. It was probably one of the best soups I've ever made... had a full flavor that I often find lacking in my homemade soups. Of course, I now usually add a teaspoon of red-wine or other vinegar to my soups which also seems to improve flavor. Dollop of yoghurt was a delicious addition. I highly recommend combining the recipes!

Although we were pleased with the short prep and cooking time of the soup, we felt that it was lacking in spice. We added some red pepper sauce and some chili powder to give it an extra kick, but it was still not really savoury enough.

Just for reference, green lentils take significantly longer to cook and stay more intact than red lentils. So any time you add green lentils to a recipe that calls for red (or the reverse) you'll want to change the cook time a little. :)

I used green lentils and added potatoes, a bay leaf and a shot of balsamic vinegar. The finished product received rave reviews! I found, though, that twenty minutes simmering time turned into a little over thirty minutes.
