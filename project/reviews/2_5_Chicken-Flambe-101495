I made this dish a while back for my family expecting great things, but was very dissappointed with the end result. The flavors just did not go together well in my opinion. I like all the ingredients by themselves, but as a whole, it did not work.

As Julia Child would likely say, this is NOT a diet recipe! However, if you are entertaining guests who like to splurge occasionally, this dish is a winner. Instead of serving shoestring potatoes, I prepared a wonderful vegetable salad and grilled portobello mushrooms with the chicken and sauce, all to rave reviews. The vegetables offset the richness of the chicken perfectly. Sinful and yummy!
