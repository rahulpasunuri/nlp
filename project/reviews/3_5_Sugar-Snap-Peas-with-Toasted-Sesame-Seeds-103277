Very tasty! I added soy sauce instead of salt, and some red pepper flakes. These added a little more flavor; will definitely make these again!

Super easy, but just okay. Will continue trying other sugar snap pea recipes.

Wasn't sure what to do with my excess of sugar snap peas. This was so simple and delicious!

This was really good with the seared tuna i made, it had a really nice green crunchy taste. I put a little rice vineagar on. Delicious.

The peas were crisp, and the sesame flavors tasty. It was not fabulous, however. I think it would work best with other Asian-type dishes. I served it with a lemony chicken, so it was just ok.

This was so easy and played to rave reviews - I had it for a party over the weekend, and am still getting comments about how tasty it was.

These are so simple to make and taste wonderful. I thought the sesame oil really complimented the sweetness of the snaps. I will make this one regularly.

Rediculously easy. I always blanched snap peas and couldn't figure out why they didn't taste as good as those I've had in restaurants and I've learned that steaming is a far superior method to blanching for snap peas. Perfect.

A nice change with sugar snaps. Tasty.

Actually, I used snow peas and sliced carrots. The sesame seeds and oil are delicious over these veggies. They went well with the baked tarragon salmon (dill rather than tarragon) and cucumber relish. Very simple
