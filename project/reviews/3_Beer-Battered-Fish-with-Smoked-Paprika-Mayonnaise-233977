I honestly love fish and chips. Perhaps the mayo makes this dish, but the beer batter (even with added salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried oregano and onion powder [about 1/4-1/2 tsp a pop]) was severely lacking. I used a good bottle of a Belgian Blonde beer, fresh white cod fillets, and good oil. No good. It was bland and, while it looked amazing, didn't come close to hitting the spot. Would try another recipe over this one.

The sauce was good, but the fish was average at best. I used tilapia.

Well, here's the thing...this is one of the best things I've ever tasted. It was the first time I have ever fried fish. But - I had to change the recipe a little. You can't buy beer in Ga. on Sundays, so all I had to put in the batter was San Pellegrino. (I don't know whether you're supposed to say the San part, but that's another review for another time) The fish was super light and fluffy - and I made the paprika mayo the same way as in the recipe. Added cayenne and paprika to the batter too. It was delightful. I was thinking that the next time I made it, I would use the beer - but maybe I won't!

Pretty good. Everyone enjoyed the paprika mayo. Used a LOT of vegi oil. Got away with 1.5".

I didn't deep-fry, no need to use all that oil. Used buckwheat flour, no salt and made my own mayo. Yeh, it was good, nothing exceptional.

This is a pretty good batter, although it really is quite thick. Next time I'd try it with a bit more beer. It didn't coat the fish very easily. The mayo came out terrific however. Definitely adds a nice touch to any seafood dish.

This is a keeper as far as the beer batter recipe and ratio. Super crispy and light. I added some Old Bay seasoning to the batter rather than the salt. The smokey paprika mayo was fantastic! I'll be using the leftover mayo on turkey sandwiches tomorrow.

I used fresh catfish as the fish and Abita Turbo Dog as the beer and the dish was great. The fried coating was light and tasty. My husband and I both really liked it. I followed the recipe exactly for the smoked-paprika mayonaise and it was very good. My husband, who is not a huge fan of capers, even liked it and said he'd certainly eat it again.

I made this recipe today for lunch. My husband and I enjoyed the fish very much. I salted and peppered the fish prior to dipping it into the batter and I also added a dash of smoked paprika into the batter as well. As I did not make all the fish called for in the recipe, I also fried some veggies with the leftover batter. It was Excellent!!! My husband also agrees. On the sauce, he does not enjoy capers, so I just mixed some aioli with mayonaisse and added the smoked paprika and YUM. I made only enough to fill a small ramekin and we had leftovers, but it went well with the fish. I will definitely make this again. Next time to give our 3 year old, who we think might like it as well!

The fish was good and easy (the first time I've ever made battered fish), but the sauce was nasty. I didn't even bother to keep the leftovers. I'll definitely make the fish again but next time I'll use lemon or plain ole tartar sauce.

Little too bland and gets hard when cold. But taste was nice if eaten immediately

The fish needed some spice, was a bit bland for me and my husband. The sauce was good, though.

Great recipe! Smoked Paprika is also known as Pimenton Picante and can be found in Spanish supermarkets, or on Amazon.com : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001MI7TI/104-2725317-4151911?v=glance&n=3370831

The fish was good, but the mayo was the star of this recipe. My store didn't have smoked paprika, so I used regular with a little cumin added. I used the leftover mayo in tuna salad, and that was excellent.

A great source of seasonings including smoked Spanish paprika is Penzeys Spices at www.penzeys.com. A 1/2 cup glass jar is $3.69. I'm on my way to their store in Oak Park, IL this afternoon so that I can try this recipe.

Badia has a line of condiments that frequently are displayed only in ethnic (especially hispanic) food sections. They have a smoked paprika, as well as several very reasonably-priced spices.

This is a great way to make fried fish! I was making the fish for fish tacos, so I didn't make the mayo, but it sounds yummy as well (& would probably work with the fish tacos if I hadn't promised the kids mango & avocado salsa). I used a victorian perch that was fantastic!
