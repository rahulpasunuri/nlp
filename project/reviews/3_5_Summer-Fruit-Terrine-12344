Made this recipe back in 1991 and have been scouring my old Gourmet magazines looking for it. Thank you epicurious. This terrine is best prepared when the fruit is perfectly ripe. It is a way to enjoy peaches and berries at their best, without adulterating them. The taste is pure, both sweet and tart. While it takes some time to prepare, you'll find it well worth the effort.

Sort of a glorified jello mold. I didn't put enough jello between layers and mine fell apart a little bit. All around good but a lot of work.

This is indeed a beautiful dessert and it tastes fabulous, too. It is very light and refreshing, and very unique. This would be a perfect low-fat dessert for a dinner party. However, I found that the amount of the peach/wine gelatin mixture in the recipe was not quite enough to cover all of the fruit. I will increase the ingredients for that part of the recipe when I make it again.

My favorite for summer time. Makes wonderful presentation and its really delicious. Adults and kids love it! Great for a crowd. Some work to make, but really pays off. Looks gorgeous and it is a very lite desert that will certainly please.
