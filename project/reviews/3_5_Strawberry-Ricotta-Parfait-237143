Made these for a small dinner party where I wanted something light. I added a little demerera sugar with the balsamic vineagar to the strawberries and mint and used almond cookies as recommended by one of the other revieweres. They were a real hit!

Yummy...in my slightly altered version, sweetened the ricotta with demerera sugar, added a dash of almond extract as well, squeezed lime over the strawberries rather than vinegar and topped with a raspberry coulis (from frozen berries)
