I'm afraid this shouldn't even be rated "Okay" at least not by me. I used a spring form pan and after 45 mins. @ 350 degrees it appeared baked (in fact I was concerned that I may have over baked it). It passed the toothpick test so I removed it from the oven to cool. After about 10 mins. the center of the cake had collapsed in on itself, and when I cut into it it was raw in the center. Ended up throwing the whole thing in the garbage. Sad waste of ingredients and effort. Wouldn't be trying this recipe again.

This recipe was easy to follow and delicious! The only changes I made were I reduced the sugar by a 1/2 cup since I thought that it would be way too sweet with the icing as well. I had three really ripe bananas, but I wasn't able to fill a cup so I added 1/4 of a chopped apple and walnuts. It still came out great!

Okay this has to be the BEST Banana Cake I've made. The ONLY thing I did different was to add a cup of mini chocolate chips into the batter. Yummo! I made a buttercream icing instead of the one mentioned as I had to double the recipe to fit in the Open Book pan I was using. My Mom said it would be great with Walnuts in it. Didn't want nuts in it as I made it for my Nephews First Communion and he does not like nuts in cake. It was his day after all! :-)

Easy and quick, this is a hardy recipe. I baked it eggless and egged, substituted the buttermilk for plain low-fat yoghurt, added walnuts, and it turned out well both times. I didn't use the frosting recipe, so I can't speak to that. But the cake is a keeper, great for whenever there are overriped bananas lying around.

This was great! Used other makers ideas and added extra bananas. Also i made a sugar syrup with vanilla, cinnamon and brandy and poured that over the hot cake and let it soak in. Delicious

AWESOME! I didn't use the frosting because it was so sweet by itself. I did what another cook did and baked in a Bundt pan for just under 40 minutes!!! YUMMMMMY! Oh, I used 4 bananas and canola oil. Next time I add the mini choclate chips and cut the sugar by 1/4.

OMG!!! To die For!!! This cake was so good the first ime, I made it again 2 days later for my sister's BBQ and it was the only dessert that was completely finished. I followed another reviewer's advice and use 3 bananas, used canola oil instead and baked in a bundt pan about 45-50 minutes. I used store-bought cream cheese frosting and offered it on the side as this cake was so moist and flavorful, it wasnt needed, but of course the frosting made it even better. I got so many compliments and next time I will add chocolate chips for variety. This cake is now on my favorite list. I'm telling you!!! Make this cake!!!!!

I have no experience baking, yet the cake turn out tasty and moist. I used 1/2 and 1/2 olive and corn oil and plain yogurt since I couldn't find buttermillk, I decorated with little yellow flowers all over, came out very pretty.

Just served this cake at work and it was gone in a flash! I doubled the recipe and made 2 10" layers, so it could serve a crowd. Used bananas from the freezer, had a little extra, which I just added, other than that did exactly according to recipe. Had to bake about 5-7 min. longer than recipe called for due to larger pan size. Compliments all around and since it was easy to make to boot I will be making it again.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always loved. I particulary like this recipe compared to the others on epicurious because it uses oil (I used canola) rather than butter - slightly healthier. This time, to make it even more "healthy," I used half whole wheat pastry flour and for the frosting, used half fat free cream cheese. I also used sour cream instead of buttermilk b/c that's what I had. It still came out great!

This is my stand by banana cake recipe. I have been making it for years as written. I only add a bit of vanilla to the frosting. Adults and children love this cake. If you are not looking for a classic banana cake, than this is not the recipe for you. Otherwise go for it. It comes out perfect everytime!

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this cake. If you are looking for a basic banana-cake recipe, make this one, don't make the other one on this website that's from Bon Apetit 1997. Everyone loved this cake, and it was extremely easy to work with. I baked the cakes a little bit longer than I meant to but there was absolutely no harm done - they were still perfectly moist. Also, the cakes were very sturdy and came out of the pans easilly. And the frosting is absolutely perfect - not too sweet, and not too cream-cheesey. Note - I followed the advice of other reviewers - I used olive oil instead of vegt oil, and I added a little extra banana, and I added little vanilla to the frosting.

This is YUMMY! I added an extra banana (extra ripe), used olive oil and made them into cupcakes. I just dusted them w/powdered sugar. They are moist and healthy.

East to make, super moist, delicious banana cake but I made some changes... used 3 bananas (a little more than a cup of mashed bananas), used some buttermilk but also put in some sour cream (probably more like 1/2 cup combo of buttermilk and two large scoops of sour cream). Sour cream makes a cake even more deliciously moist. Used a cup of wheat flour and a 1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour (added a little more flour because I used more sour cream & bananas). Used olive oil and not Veggie oil. Baked entire batter in a bundt pan for 50 minutes (be careful to never over-bake cakes! Underbaking a tad is ok - but never over-bake!). Didn't frost the cake - just sprinkled some confectioner's sugar on top. OUT OF THIS WORLD! Easy and fast to make and very moist.

I doubled the sugar quantity for the frosting and it still was too "cream cheesy" tasting. Just did not care for the frosting with the cake. I would maybe substitute it for a different frosting.

Very good cake - tastes just like banana bread, but with a cakey texture. I would recommend just a few alterations: I would make this as a bundt or sheet cake (or even cupcakes) rather than the layer cake. The cake being slightly heavier and moister than a standard cake, the layers did not slice as nicely, so the presentation was not as pretty as I would have liked. I used a different cream cheese frosting (a quick cream cheese buttercream) and it was wonderful. Using fresh bananas to garnish is delicious, but don't do what I did and put them in between the layers - they were too squishy and this was a big reason for my layers not slicing neatly. I decorated the cake with tiny flowers in pastel pink piped out of the same cream cheese frosting and it gave it a beautiful springtime look!

This is a great cake! It has a great banana flavor that lighter than banana bread, but not weaker, because it is paired with vanilla and not cinnamon and cloves and other spices that make it more heavy. The cake was very quick and easy to make. I used three very brown and over-ripe bananas. I didn't have any cream cheese so I made a sour cream frosting which I got at www.allrecipes.com. The cake fell a little after I took it out of the oven and the middle got a little stuck to the pan, so I may bake it for a little longer next time (the recommended 25 minutes) instead of my 22 minutes. If you like banana bread and white/vanilla cake I think that you will like this recipe, or if you don't like cinnamon in your desserts and don't want chocolate.(Many Europeans don't share the American taste for cinnamon.)

A very easy, good recipe. I did add 1 tsp. vanilla to the icing. It was a hit!

This cake was very good. I did put some bananas in the middle and it was delicious. I also added an extra banana in the mix. I would definitely make again. It was a very easy recipe.

The texture and consistency of this cake was wonderful. It was perfectly moist and tender, but the banana flavor was too subtle. I might try adding another smashed banana or perhaps some banana extract (the natural kind) when I make this again. YUMMY!!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it had a nice flavor that went well with the cream cheese frosting. Everyone who had a slice kept on sneeking back for just one more slice, before I knew it was all gone.

This has become my family's new favorite cake. Even those non-banana lovers have found a new favorite! Overly ripe, almost black bananas, work best and give a deep banana flavor. I used another frosting recipe after reading the reviews. 1 stick butter, 1 box powdered sugar (cut back if you don't like it too sweet), 1 stick cream cheese. I even doctored it up more, by placing fresh banana slices on the frosting between layers, and added dark Scharffen Berger chocolate shavings to the top. Fabulous!!!

Fantastic and very easy.I've been making this for some time using only my food processor and everyone who has tried it has asked for the recipe, I've used a standard cream cheese frosting. This cake is a a must.

A few years ago, I reviewed this cake quite enthusiastically. Hmmm, perhaps my taste has changed. Today I found the cake to be a bit dense(though perhaps my banana and buttermilk measurements were a trifle generous). The ICING was AWFUL. Sticky consistency and marginal taste. Waste of ingredients. So, I would make the cake again (more careful measuring), but use a different icing.

This is a very light cake, atypical of previous banana cakes I have made.

This is a very nice, fluffy, light cake and is simple to make. My kids and I made the recipe into cupcakes (it made 24), which were delicious! (However, we used a different cream-cheese frosting recipe that's a family favorite, so can't comment on this one.) Don't hesitate to make this cake -- it's a keeper!

Yummy! I love this cake! I've made it at least a dozen times. It's moist and not too sweet. Best of all, it's a breeze to make. Instead of mashing the bananas, I used a hand blender to smooth out the wet ingredients and the cake turned out less dense. A great recipe for those over-ripe bananas that nobody wants to eat.

I'm sorry - this did not impress. The cake was dry and the frosting was not very sweet.

This recipe was super easy and fast to make. I made it with two 8" square pans instead of round. It got thumbs up from all who ate it. I will definately make it again.

This is a great cake! I made it in a bundt pan and baked it for about 40 minutes. I didn't have time to frost it so I just sprinkled it with powdered sugar. Good. I wonder how it would be to sprinkle it with cinnamon-sugar?

Fabulous! Everyone loved it. I put a layer of sliced bananas inbetween the layers of the cake as well as icing. Definitely a keeper! Next time I will put chopped, toasted pecans on the top to garnish.

Moist and delicious. I chose this particular recipe because I have banana trees in my garden. When a bunch ripens it's impossible to eat them all, so I freeze some. Frozen bananas work fine in this recipe. I took the cake to a birthday party and it was a big hit.

I will not comment on the cake because I didn't have buttermilk and I interchanged 2 tablespoons of milk and 2 tablespoons of sour cream for the buttermilk and it was just not great. However, this is the best cream cheese frosting I've made - that part was definitely a keeper for another carrot cake perhaps.

My whole family loves this recipe. I bring it camping and we eat it all weekend: for breakfast and dessert. It is very moist and the cream cheese frosting is great.
