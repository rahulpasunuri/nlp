Absolutely delicious--worth the work and the expense for a birthday treat!

This is an exceptional burger, however it is expensive and a lot of work. Not exactly the hot dogs and hamburger meal for the kiddies. For those who do not live in a place where marrow is commonly found, a suitable substitute is pate de foie gras (believe it or not, actually easier to find). I recommend eating this with minimal add-ons. The flavor carries itself. One other note - barbecue with a dimple in the middle and immediately season after cooked to medium.

Fabulous!! Not an everyday burger from an expense and a health standpoint but really delicious and worth it as a splurge. I didn't make the pickles and ketchup and didn't put anything on the burger; it needed nothing else.

This burger was fantastic. My husband claims it is the _best_ burger he has ever eaten. I've made it 3 X already and it is part of my permanent set of go to recipes for special occasions. Yes, it's a lot of work (I hated cleaning up the grinder but that would be true of any recipe using the grinder... it's messy.) This is not a burger for a quick mid-week meal unless you make them up ahead and freeze them. Bone marrow, especially from grass-finished beef, is an excellent source of vitamin K2 (MK-4). This is the vitamin that tells calcium to go to your bones instead of your vascular system. I made the burgers as the recipe said but skipped the pickles and katsup plus used store-bought buns. It was still the best burger ever.

This was awful. So excited to try it too. Went to my butcher and got all the meats, marrow and fat. Ground it and I was left with grainy burgers, made with $40 of meat. Good old ground chuck from the butcher is SO MUCH BETTER, 1/4 the price and 1/8 of the time.

Amazingly delicious and worth all the fuss. Luckily supermarkets in Florida carry "bones for marrow" as well as suet and the various cuts of beef.

These were good, but entirely too much work both in tracking down the ingredients and in prep. Next time I will make the pickles and ketchup- pickles are especially good, and either do my own ground chuck or buy some fresh ground chuck to make them.

OMG - this is enough to make me cancel my subscription to Bon Apetit! Who has the time and ingredients to actually make this burger? Not to mention the terribly fatty ingredients. Since it was the cover illustration for Sept., I eagerly looked for the recipe. But I wouldn't make this version.

No Bueno, I'd rather have a peanut butter and jelly on a flour tortilla.

This simply didn't work for me

Sorry, this recipe is WAY too much to make cheeseburgers. Didn't even try and I generally don't mind going to the ends of the Earth to get a meal together. Don't diss me, just a comment. Thanks.

I made this for my husband to be last night and we both adored it! We live in Yuma, AZ and had to travel to Scottsdale for the indgredients -- completely worth it. The miso added that extra bit of savoriness,and although I normally do not eat ground beef I found myself consuming every bite.

Easy for a resturant owner-chef to do with helpers and equipment, but way too much work for a Cheeseburger at home. Unless your a cook with nothing but time on your hands.
