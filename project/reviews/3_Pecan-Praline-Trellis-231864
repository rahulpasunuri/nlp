This was absolutely WONDERFUl! I made it for Mother's Day brunch and I had to hide a few pieces for my friend's husband to take home because people were inhaling it! I had no problems with the dough or the filling leaking out. Great bread!

Although easy to make, the dough was the only redeeming part of this pastry. And the dough wasn't even that great. The pecan-praline filling was blindingly sweet and didn't caramalize thoroughly.

Okay, I'll admit right off the bat that I'm one of those reviewers that did not make the exact recipe, which is why I'm only rating three forks instead of four. I did not use the filling indicated because of a previous review and made the filling from the Blueberry Cheese Danish recipe on this site. I made the cream cheese mixture (omitted the blueberry part) and added a tube of almond paste to it. Wow, was it delicious! Also, the dough for this bread was super easy to make, easy to handle and roll and tasted wonderful all by itself. I'll definitely make this again.

Made this for Easter brunch, a big hit with everyone. The recipe is easier than it looks, dough came out beautifully with my standing mixer and the roasted pecans with sea salt make a wonderful filling.

I have made this twice and my family loves it. The first time I made it the butter ran out quite a bit. The second time I made sure to have the side solid with the lattice ON TOP and did not have the leakage. I like the filling as is but am a tinkerer and think I would like to try a creamcheese/fruit filing sometime. The basic dough recipie is fine as is.

The bread was good and needed no modification at altitude. The 'stuffing' left a LOT to be desired. Would be better with some kind of fruit filling.

An incredible recipe that produced a flavorful morning bread. I have an Uncle who recently suffered a stroke and can no longer eat wheat. Does anyone know conversion ratios and characteristics of potato or rice flour or whole wheat flour. rfpeterlin@hotmail.com

Very nice bread, the first time I made it exactly to recipe but thought filling needed something, second time I made it I added cinnamon and some ground cardamom, that was delicious.
