I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and seved with the red leaf, radish and pine nut salad and some cornbread. It was amazing. We got up Christmas Day sorry there wasn't any leftover for breakfast. Will make it again soon for après ski. I cheated and threw it altogether in the pot I braised pork tenderloin in, and let it simmer for an hour or so. Quick and easy. Next time I will make enough for leftovers.

It's the rainy season here in northern California and warm/comfort was the search of the day. My husband wanted to make the posole that just came out recently, but ended up on this one, mostly due to the reviews. Big 4 forks for this recipe! It was so awesome and comforting and delicious. I never thought hominy had any redeeming qualities - just a little ball of bland - but this recipe converted me! After a little google action, he found out it's not really posole without hominy. At least in this recipe, they aren't bland balls, they are tasty morsels...like little tortillas floating in your soup. (I had the same prejudice against garbanzos till I found the African Chickpea Soup on this site - DO IT!) Enough of me blabbing on... my husband says: he changed nothing!

First time, I prepared per the recipe, except that I couldn't find ancho chile powder, so used smoked paprika and added a chipotle pepper and adobo sauce. Complex, smoky flavor. It tasted divine, although it wouldn't win any beauty contests, to be sure. Last night, I swiped some ideas from the "Classic posole" recipe also on this site: added the tomatoes and (fresh) tomato puree, and served w/ cabbage and radishes, per one of the reviews. I also had so much meat juices left over, I simply added that in, dumped in a bunch of water and skipped the chicken broth. The dish totally ROCKED--prettier and healthier, to boot!

This was wonderful! Great, hearty X-mas supper that felt so very warming and comforting yet simple and not at all heavy. Served with lots of toppings recommended by Latino friends: chopped radishes, white onion, shredded cabbage, dried oregano, in addition to the suggested toppings. Made it such fun to serve. Was also pressed by a Mexican chef to use whole dried ancho chiles in place of the powder. I toasted them in a pan briefly, immersed them in a bowl of boiling water for about 30 minutes, then blended with some of the soaking liquid. Excellent flavor from this! Used about 6 dried anchos. Will mix in other types of dried chiles next time to add to the depth of flavor. Also, since I had the time I went ahead and made pork stock for use in place of the chicken broth. Just some bones from the butcher, roasted then simmered with the usual stock ingredients. Easy.

Wonderful recipe - makes a base for a number of different meals. I doubled the recipe, doing half pork and half chicken. Served it on Christmas Eve with warm corn tortillas and a variety of toppings - queso fresco, lime wedges, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, black beans & rice. Folks wrapped their own posole soft tacos - delicious. The next day I used it in chilaquiles, layering left over crisped tortillas with beans, posole and scrambled eggs, topped with the queso fresco and sour cream. Great Christmas breakfast for a crowd. I plan to thin the remaining posole with chicken broth and serve as a hearty soup. Well worth the effort and everyone raved about the posole!

Made this for guests, and even the fussy eater requested the recipe. Only change I'd make next time is I'd shred the pork while still warm, rather than cubing it when cold the next day.

This recipe ROCKS! The best thing is that because it is cooked long and slow, the toughest cuts of meat are ideal and lend great flavor. Have made it several times--is so hearty, a small portion with corn bread and salad is plenty. Good comfort food on a rainy day, and very easy.

Wonderful recipe! My young daughters loved picking at the pork while it was cooling, just fell apart in their fingers. I had to make them stop so that I could finish making the recipe. Got this right on the first try, so it's easy to make. Great Super Bowl food.

This was my first attempt at pozole - I can't even describe how good it was. The cooling and skimming process allows you to remove much of the fat, so this is a lean tasting dish. This recipe makes a huge batch to feed your family for days - it is definitely better after a day or so in the fridge. Adding strips of corn tortilla, lime, and cilantro is a must!

This is excellent! My brothers wife is from Mexico and has made Posole for us. I'd have to say this was better. Followed the recipe to a T with 2 minor changes. Used pork stock instead of chicken, browned the pork pieces in hot oil first and then cooked the onions in the same pot. And sprinkled some shreded Queso Fresco cheese on top with the green onions and lime.

My wife and I fell in love with posole when working in New Mexico back in the mid 90s. Having cooked several different versions in the years since (recipes called "pork and hominy stew," "posole rojo," etc.), we found this one. It is simply the best. This is as authentic as it gets. The flavor is exceptional. Skimming the fat made it even better - without sacrificing taste. My wife bought some of the ingredients for me, and came home with only two cans of chiles instead of four (she couldn't believe we would use $12 of chiles). I substituted a few diced, pickled hot jalopenos for the two unbought cans, and it was still terrific. All the other posole recipes will go by the wayside for a bit in our house!

This will be the third Christmas that I have made this and my family and friends just love it.In fact my kids coming up from Atlanta call in advance to make sure that I don't forget.I have started this meal first thing in the morning and it is ready by dinner time in the evening.

This recipe is to die for! There are very few if any leftovers when I make this. I like the 2 day process to make sure that the fat is properly skimmed from the broth. Will be making again this month!

I have now made this twice to take on camping trips to feed large groups. I freeze it and store it in a cooler until it's time to eat. Then I heat it and serve with corn bread, sour cream, cilantro and shredded green cabbage. It feeds me and my ego - every single person just raves about how great it is and there is never a scrap left. I used pork necks one time as my butcher didn't have the Boston cut - more labor intensive to get the bones and cartilege out but very tastey.

Made for Cinco de Mayo. Really good. Halved the recipe and it still made a lot.

I made a recipe for a spice rubbed pork loin from this site that used all the same seasonings and made this with the leftovers. It worked out great and was perfect for using up the extra pork. Definitely need to serve this with cornbread.

This recipe is outstanding. I've made it three times in the last two months. As I was eating it, I thought it would be really good as a enchilada/taco filling. So the last time I made it, I swapped chicken breasts for the pork, followed all other directions as written, and it turned out perfectly. It was a big hit at the Super Bowl party yesterday!

Served this dish at a holiday open house. It received rave reviews and multiple requests for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. The hominy does add to the dish. Allowing the broth and meat to chill and removing the fat was important.

Made this recipe for the 1st time and LOVED it. Definitely need to cook pork day before to let the fat solidify for easy removal. I shredded pork same day and discarded a lot of fat and the bone. Ended up cooking another pork shoulder (because it came with 2 from Sam's Club approx 9 lbs) in water w/spices and added extra meat to original. Due to the extra meat added additional 2 14 oz cans chicken broth. Very tasty

My sister-in law is from mexico and is a wonderful cook. This is my favorite dish she makes. I never thought I could get close to making it like hers. This recipe hits it pretty close. I took this to a holiday party at work and got rave reviews. The only difference in her recipe is she uses dried ancho chiles. She also chops up cabbage, cilantro and onions (keeps seperated) and everyone tops off their soup with what they like. We use tostados with sqeezed lime juice and sour cream spread on them for dipping in the soup! YUM YUM!

This was SO good! After growing up in the Southwest, I've resigned myself to the fact that if I want really authentic tasting food I'm going to have to make it myself. This was so worth the effort! I used a picnic shoulder rather than the boston butt, but otherwise made it just like the recipe says. I'd never put hominy in anything before, and I can't say how the canned version compares to the real thing, but I loved the corn flavor I found in my can. Two days later the leftovers were even better! Everyone loved this, I will SO make it again!

Just made this starting yesterday and today. I did have to add more broth, more chiles and more of the spices for my tastes. It was wonderful!! Served it with crusty bread and sangria.

I thought this was wonderful. I was a bit concerned because it was so simple with so few ingredients, but it was absolutely delicious. Made it as written, except I used bone-in country-style ribs (pork shoulder blade); I just threw them in the braising liquid whole. I will be making this again!

I made this for my family for New Years Day. The recipe halves well. I found it difficult to put the meat in the fridge after the first roasting step because the meal was so moist, tender and loaded with flavor. I am sharing this recipe with friends and highly recommend this. -- Robin

We made this for the first time this week-- what a delicious and simple thing! A few notes-- after reading the other reviews, we decided to reconstitute our hominy from the dried kernels, as recommended. Well, since the recipe calls for drained/wet hominy, we didn't know how much to make and used two pint containers of dried hominy. WAY, WAYYYY too much! Half of one would have been perfect. Because of the amount of hominy, we had to boil the stuff for nearly seven (!!!) hours before the kernels began to pop, and even after that each piece still had a tough shell attached and a tiny, hard, seed-like center. We cleaned and shelled about three cups by hand before we gave up and used the rest as-is. In the end the hand-cleaning part was maybe unnecessary, as the hominy continued to soften as it stewed. We only had room for about half what the recipe called for and ended up using about 4 cups of fresh hominy. Also added around 5 cups of chicken broth near the end to thin it out-- we love meat, but wow this is a TON of it. Next time I might use just a bit less pork just to have more room for other things. We doubled the garlic, ground our own ancho powder from the dried ones, and used a lot more spice than was called for-- rave reviews from a group of 20! The toppings really added a lot of punch snd contrast at the end, and serving it with spicy cornbread was a perfect side. Next time we'll use canned hominy just to see what the difference is, but we'll definitely make this again.

Being a native New Mexican living in Southern California, I have slaved for 14 years making my grandmother's posole each Christmas Eve! Well, I decided to try something a bit different this year and this recipe was amazing! I followed the recipe and even used the canned hominy. I brought in a Spanish (from Spain) touch and used sweet smoked pimenton (paprika) instead of the chile powder. The result was nothing short of fabuloso! My relatives loved it and the "innovative" spin on a familial custom may actually be a new tradition at the Christmas table!

Excellent! Made this recipe exactly according to recipe and my family raved about it. I had one relative stay the holiday with us who (gasp) doesn't like hominy. I had to revamp the recipe slightly by replacing the four cans of hominy with 2 cans of corn and two cans of garbonzo beans (drained). Everyone liked it even more and ate it like I was going to take it away from them (including the hominy hater).

You cannot, I repeat cannot, make Posole with canned hominy. Maybe you make a dish you like, maybe it is a hominy stew, but it isn't posole. The difference between canned posole and dried posole is the same as many other vegetables you may be more familiar with, The texture and flavor that "cooked from dried" adds to the finished broth are essential to this dish. The real thing takes quite a whole to reconstitute the kernals. So please continue to enjoy this dish if you like, but this dish is, in no way, authentic posole. If you can't buy it dried where you live, you can find it online easily enough as well as a recipe for the original and you will be amazed at the difference.

This is the second time I made this dish, my wife loves pozole and this is her favorite. I am making this with a New Mexico style stacked red and green Christmas enchiladas. I would recommend Hatch green chile fresh roasted if you can manage to get some; I travel to New Mexico once a year and stock up on them. I followed the recipe to the "T", and it is wonderful. I am using a little less pork this time, 6 plus pounds made it more a stew than a soup.

I will never slave cubing raw pork again for posole or carnitas after using this braising technique. The final outcome was succulent meat and layers of flavor! It definitely improves the longer it sits. I halved the recipe and it was mistake because it vanished in no time. The only substitution I made was using whole canned green chilis. They have a much better texture and taste and when you coarse cut them they add to the home made look.

One other change I made, which I have been making to just about all the recipes I use these days with sauteed onions, is allow the onions to caramelize. It takes ~30-40 minutes of very slow and low cooking, with splashes of broth to make sure they don't burn (again an America's Test Kitchen method), but it makes the onions really delicious and adds a depth of flavor to recipes I really like.

I first have to say I did not follow the recipe exactly. I had a lot of left over 6/7-hr slow roasted Boston pork butt roast (from the Cook's Testing Kitchen best roasted pork recipe, chilled along with defatted drippings), which I wanted to use, and came across this recipe. I cubed the pork. I only had whole dried ancho chiles on hand, so I shortly pan fried them to soften them up, then tore them up, and somewhere along the way got them into very small pieces. I pretty much followed the recipe after that. When it came to the choice of yellow or white hominey, I was baffled, asked the store clerks and because Mexican style hominey was on sale and recommended, used that. I'll be making again and again, so if anyone has any input on hominey type, appreciated. The end soup was absolutely yummy. I took half the batch, and cooled the spices off by adding more chickent broth for my folks, who don't like real spicy food, but ate that too before I had a chance to put it up in the freezer. Again, yum, yum. I have some leftover pork loin roast I tried brining and slow cooking (didn't work so well), with defatted drippings, which I'll be cutting up and making into this soup again today. The only thing I would have to say about using leftover pork to make this into a real yummy soup is make sure you save the drippings; after the pork comes out of the oven, add some wine/dry sherry, and chicken/vegetable broth, to deglaze the roasting pan, bring to boil to burn off alcohol if using, reduce to simmer, and then strain, cool, refrigerate, and skim fat. That will give you a good amount of pork broth base to work with.
