Well, I learned my lesson. Decided to drive to our favorite summer retreat a day early and leave the plane for transporting guests on Saturday for a southwestern feast. I made my tortillas on Friday night. First using plastic it was a disaster. Everything stuck, nothing rounded out, all of the problems listed. Then I tried waxed paper as suggested. I was proud. Saturday however brought high, extremely gusty winds, severe turbulence as well as a wildfire that closed the main route in to Panguitch and spread smoke over several hundred square miles. Our friend Wes, an excellent pilot to my passable abilities, used his excellent judgement to determine that attempting to fly in the unpredictable conditions as well as occasionally blinding smoke was not the call to make. Realizing that the weekend was not to be I puttered around the old house and fixed a simple supper. On Sunday morning, somewhat disappointed I headed home by car. Determined to make this a culinary success I stopped at a small farm owned by the Quintana family on the way to my detour around the fire. We have befriended them and often buy vegetables that they have in their garden that we don't have in ours. I asked Nana Maria to taste my tortillas. I asked if they tasted OK. Her response? "For you, good. For (13-year-old granddaughter) Little Maria? She need to pay attention and do better." Next time I will save my time and make the fifteen minute drive north to buy a dozen of Little Maria's fresh corn tortillas. Sorry, had to tell the story. Bottom line, authentic? At least for Nana Quintana no. For the rest of us? I thought they were pretty darn good.

I don't know how many pounds pressure a press has, but, although time consuming, I get relatively thin tortillas by putting the dough between sheets of waxed paper in between two pie pans. Then I step on it. They have come out uniformally round and even. Since I'm going to the trouble of making my own tortillas, why not go all the way?

Easy and good, just like they should be! I didn't have a tortilla press, so I just used two large and smooth corningware plates with a cut ziplock between them and pressed them together (both right-side up) over the dough. Worked great! I also only used one pan on med-high heat and it seemed to work fine.

These were OK, but not great. They didn't puff and were rather dry. A number of other recipes call for more water (2 parts masa harina to 1 part water), a kneading for 2-4 minutes and a 30-60 minute rest at room temp. I will try all of these next time.

Decent, but not out of this world. I mixed in some corn kernels that I had crushed, and that helped with the flavor. But I think next time I'll substitute chicken/vegetarian stock instead of the water.

I never add lard to my tortillas, but I do layer the finished tortillas in damp towels while they keep warm in the oven and this makes all the difference! They come out soft and moist. Leftovers are not good UNLESS you wrap them in damp paper towels and seal them in a plastic bag or airtight container, and reheat them in the microwave in the same damp towels. Also, I am not fond of my tortilla press because it presses them unevenly, so I prefer to roll them out with a rolling pin between pieces of waxed paper. I may just need a better press, or lessons in how to use one right!

True story: Didn't have plastic wrap or wax paper. But did have a doggy bag. oh yeah- that's what I said. slit that sucker in two, and the tortillas came out great. a little tougher than i'd have liked. Next time I'll add lard as suggested...

These babies need some salt. I think solid shortening or lard would improve them, too.

"1 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water" ? what? that's a lot of water!

I made these tonight. Instead of the plastic, I used parchment paper and it was amazing. I have always had them stick before. I took the top parchment off, then kind of slapped the tortilla on the griddle gently, and the top layer of parchment came off much easier and did not stick as I usually have problems with sticking with plastic and even waxed paper. I also added a bit of salt, but may add a bit of lard as someone suggested. I have a gas stove, so after grilling bothe sides, I put on top of a gas flame for a few minutes and they really puffed up! I think this makes them a bit more tender. A trick I learned from my East Indian friend while making Roti last night!

Corn tortillas are a wonderful meal - especially for entertaining. However, I think this recipe has one critical fault - it recommends the use of two pieces of heavy plastic to press tortillas and transfer them to the griddle. I always use waxed paper, which is less apt to stick to the tortilla and won't melt with the heat of the griddle. Try it - I promise you won't ever go back to using plastic.

Homemade tortillas are great, this recipie misses one of the key ingredients though, lard. You don't need much, but it will change the consistency and flavor.

I couldn't find a tortilla press so I used a pie plate. Worked great. The clear bottom made it easy to see where to add more pressure.

I loved these, so close to what I had in Mexico. I served them first with the pulled pork, Then with fish tacos. The left overs I deep fried and served with seviche just like they do in Mexico. The dough is so easy to work with, I will make these over and over.
