Wow, this is exactly like making paneer! (a fresh Indian cheese) It is really so simple and people are completely impressed that you made your own cheese.

as usual, faith willinger nails it right on the head, this makes a perfect firm ricotta, interesting variations include the use of fresh goat's or sheep's milk and also local organic milks to discover the terroir of cattle

I found it easy to make But, it turned out a little bit too salty and too firm when it cooled down. I dont think I'll make again.
