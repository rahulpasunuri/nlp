This is really a terrible recipe. The cautions in the other reviews about consistency are right on the money- it's ridiculously thin. The flavor is great, but it's an expensive waste of ingredients. The cake it goes with, however, is easy and wonderful.

This is probably the best frosting I have ever made! I really don't care much for frosting & have tried Italian Buttercream, Reg Buttercream, Shortening Buttercream, Cream Cheese, Quick Buttercream (pastry cream base), etc. & have not been pleased. I did tweak the recipe a little after reading the reviews. I made a 1/3rd batch, but w/ 2 sticks of butter, 2 pkgs of cream cheese, 2 tblsp shortening, 4 tbs powdered sugar & 12oz white chocolate. I omitted the alcohol (making this for kid-friendly wedding in August) & used 2 tsp coconut extract instead. I followed the directions, but added the shortening to the butter & cream cheese & the powdered sugar after all the white chocolate had been incorporated. It made a satiny-smooth, light & barely sweet frosting. I actually liked it! The texture was similar to an Italian Buttercream, but without the heaviness. I would highly recommend this! But to avoid lumps it is necessary to beat the cheese & butter for quite awhile on med to high speed on a stand mixer. I think I let it beat for at least 10 mins because I forgot to take the stuff out of the fridge to bring up to room temp. I think this will be my new go-to frosting recipe. By the way, it was enough to frost & fill a 9in cake, 4in high.

mmmm... this is yummy and EASY. I just made a 1/4 recipe - without the cointreau - and it's silky and not too sweet.

I loved this recipe. I made a four layer cake and had the exact amount of icing needed by halfing the recipe twice. The icing was a great consistancy, considering the other reviews. Before serving the cake, the cake should be left out 15 to 30 minutes ahead of time for the cream cheese icing to soften. The icing tastes better. I had served the cake right from the fridge and couldn't taste the flavor of the icing.

My entire family--from 3 picky teenagers to my thin-finicky-eater husband adored this recipe. Completely out of character, the cake was gone in 2 days! Because I used the frosting for a 3 layer chocolate cake with raspberry couli, I halved the frosting recipe. (I still had about 1.5 cups of frosting left over.) Having read the previous helpful reviews regarding the thin consistency, I added an additional 4 oz of cream cheese to the halved recipe. Altogether, I used (2) 8 oz bars of cream cheese and (1) 8 oz bar of Neufchatel, "light" cream cheese. The flavor was awesome and the consistency perfect-an alternative to chilling.

mmm. i adore white chocolate. For the cream cheese I substituted 16 oz of it with strawberry cream cheese. Definitely I agree with others that it's not as easy to spread as other icings. The consistency is just very thin. Chilling slightly fixes that.

This is a good frosting. I agree with the previous reviewer, it has to be chill for a while before using in a pastry bag.

Piping was a problem the first time out. I very finely chopped the cool white chocolate with a food processor before melting it the second try, and used room-temperature cream cheese. I whipped until very smooth. It then needs to either be cooled to appropriate consistency - which can take a while; or you could let it completely cool in the refrigerator, then bring it up to spreading/piping consistency. The taste is clearly worth the trouble! I give this 4 forks for taste, because the directions don't yield a good consistency.

Was prepared for the frosting to be a little less than perfect, but thought, oh maybe the others didn't really follow the recipe, or they were in a hurry, or used too much liquor. Well, am here to say the texture came to about like "Cool Whip". The Cake, the Ganache attached to this recipe are all great forks in rating. Made the cake last night, as well as the ganache. It is holding up GREAT! Made two different bataches of frosting: One with by the Recipe, another with less liquid and more chocolate, cream cheese, and butter. Will let you know how everyone likes it.

Such an easy icing. I didn't bother with piping because I wanted to decorate the cake by adding things to the icing (flowers, etc.) It is quite rich. I used the orange oil and received compliments on the flavor of the icing.

This frosting was difficult for me to pipe on the cake. Make certain that it is perfectly smooooth before spreading. It is tricky, I had a problem because the frosting clumped up. Very messy, I was trying to decorate my own cake until 2am the night before my wedding. It was a glorious cake in the end.

This was an easy recipe to prepare and tastes delicious. It received many praises as not being sugary sweet. It does however not like to be left out while decorating, takes a long time to chill to work in a pastry bag.
