Absolutely fabulous - just like the peameal bacon we eat when visiting family in Canada. Served this for breakfast on Thanksgiving day and it was a huge hit with everyone. So glad to have found a recipe for one of my favourite tastes from home!

To answer a few questions: the pink powder is variously called Instacure #1 or Prague powder #1 and is used for the curing of meats (to prevent botulism, etc.). It contains a small amount of sodium nitrite. A pretty good explanation can be found here: http://johndlee.hubpages.com/hub/Whats-the-Difference-Between-Insta-Cure-1-and-Insta-Cure-2-Understanding-Which-You-Need-and-Why . The curing process involves the migration of the sodium nitrite (and the flavorings) into the meat. By injecting the liquid into the middle, you are speeding up this process and making sure that all of the meat is treated.

Having grown up near Niagara Falls, peameal bacon was a special treat after a trip across the border. I was always shocked to see what stores called Canadian Bacon in other places! This is my second go with the bacon, because the first was eaten so fast by my company I barely got to taste it! I made it according to the directions execept I didn't have the 'cure' ingredient-easy! FABULOUS! I am going to try slicing it and freezing it and maybe it will last longer!

Not a rating yet but another THANK YOU!!!! I have to check with US Customs every time I go home to make sure I can bring Peameal bacon home with me. Thank you for making the real CANADIAN BACON possible without going to Canada ...although there's nothing wrong with going home!

You have made my day! I had no idea that I can make this at home and not have to wait until I visit family in Canada. But where can I find the Prague powder??? I notice it's optional. What is its purpose?

this is not a review, at least not yet, just a comment! I can't thank you enough for this recipe I (being Canadian) have told everyone for years that what American's refer to as "Canadain bacon" really is not! I grew up with peameal bacon - when I go home always have my fix of peameal bacon... thanks again will make this "tout de suite"

This is more a comment/question than a review. Is it really necessary to inject the loin? I've made it without injecting it and it seemed fine. Just want to know your thoughts...?
