This recipe was easy and delicious! i doubled the recipe with no problems, except that i ended up with 6 portions of the tapioca and maybe 3 portions of the cranberry mixture. Not a problem! I fond out later that my family enjys the tapioca better without too much cranberry, even though i thought the flavours complemented each other very nicely.
