This is a great, unusual, easy-to-make salad for a dinner party. I substituted apple juice concentrate (boiled down from our own cider), which worked fine. I used half bib lettuce and half romaine, and instead of coriander seeds used a little cardamom.

YUM! i was wary of making this because of some negative reviews but i'm glad i did. i used welch's passion fruit concentrate, white wine vinegar and added pepitas for some crunch. served at a dinner party with arroz con pollo and everyone loved it! this recipe is a keeper.

I agree with other reviewers on the fact that the vinaigrette was a bit bitter or sour - possibly because I used passion fruit nectar rather than frozen concentrate? Whatever the cause, the result was neither here nor there, which is sad as I love avocados, mangoes and coriander.

OK. Vinaigrette was a little sour.

I wish I could give this dish more forks-- it wasn't bad it just wasn't all that good, and I had high hopes after reading the recipe. The dressing was a bit too sweet but otherwise bland, and the flavors were just off and not well balanced. None of the ingredients really stood out

Since I live in Hawaii the ingredients for this salad are plentiful. When my neighbor brought me a bunch of passion fruit I decided to try this recipe. It is a keeper! My husband and I loved it. I made the mistake of buying ground coriander and the dressing was the best! I served it with seared ahi. Always a bottled dressing kind of gal, I will now be using this and other dressings from now on. WOW!!!

This was really not good- not sure what went wrong-as per another reviewer , used passion fruit juice(couldn't find concentrate)-maybe the shallots weren't good? It just seemed bitter & not pleasing at all.

This was a good salad but wasn't a big "wow" dish. Mango is not the most easy thing to cut and it wasn't really worth it. But it you have mastered to art of mango cutting then it makes a great snack.

I didn't have avacados available, so I added blueberries instead. A HUGE hit. Everyone at dinner asked for the recipe, and I made it again 4 days later. Delicious and great for Spring!

My husband and I both loved this salad. I used fresh pineapple juice in place of passion fruit concentrate, and a pinot grigio vinegar. Be sure to well-crack your coriander seeds (I think a mortar and pestal would work best), as biting into whole seeds can be a bit much & overpowering in flavor.

I made this twice. First, exactly as written; second time I used raspberry vinegar and added toasted pine nuts and blue cheese. This salad is fantastic either way! Wait until summer and I'll top it with grilled shrimp for a light dinner!

this was quick and delicious. the second time i made it i roasted the corriander for more flavor which was excellent. i substituted white balsamic vinagar with a touch of heavily concentrated (syrupy) dark balsamic. got rave reviews at both dinner part / potlucks i brought it too. i was actually trying to use some passion fruit purree i'd bought for a cheesecake. we found the puree by contacting a local desert restaurant and asking them where to get it. they sent us to a specialty resaurant supply store that was happy to sell it to us. at $10 for a large frozen can, this was a great value as the amount of passion fruit we needed for the cheesecake would have cost $40 fresh.

Excellent recipe - a bit tough to find frozen passion fruit concentrate, but other juices work as well. I used fresh passion fruit juice and the taste was wonderful. Don't skip the coriander seeds. You can find them at Indian grocery stores or at World Market.

This salad out-shined my main dish (Ricotta Spinach Pie)! The dressing was a taste bud delight. I substituted Jumex's Mango nector instead of the passion fruit juice. I also used Citrus Champagne vinegar instead of the Sherry wine vinegar. This salad was just exceptional. Perfect for spring!

I made this tonight for a St. Patrick's Day dinner party as I thought it would be perfect colour wise (orange and green!). It was such a hit!! Everyone raved about the dressing. I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers: I happened to have prickly pear marmalade bought on a holiday in Arizona and it was an excellent substitution for the passion fruit concentrate. I also added pine nuts for crunch and crab just because I love it! I used plain old curly leaf lettuce and even with all these changes the salad was amazing. My guests were begging for the recipe. I love this site and I have to say this is one of the best recipes I have tried from it.

I made this dish for a wine and food pairing party. This was a hit with my girlfriends. I added marinated grilled tropical mahi mahi on top of the salad. It paired nicely with a tropical white wine (it's been awhile since I made the recipe, so I can't remember what wine I used). Although, I remember I doubled the passion fruit vinaigrette because it was so yummy!

Found this herb salad mix at Trader Joes. Chopped mango and avocado and piled in middle of lettuce in a pleasing design ... they could take it or leave it.

Salad is delicious because the dressing is delicious. We substituted prickly pear jam for the frozen passion fruit concentrate; it worked really well. Followed another reviewer's advice and added toasted pine nuts. Good idea because the crunch contrasts nicely with the softness of the fruit. Ripe mango is a must.

I made too many changes due to a tight schedule and bad fruit/veggie luck but next time I'll make it exactly as described. I used spinach salad (which I know gets soggy looking very fast) I used organic frozen mango since my mangos were not quite ripe and a drive to 4 local grocers didn't help at all. No luck finding passion fruit concentrate so I used Langers Winter Blend concentrate, a combo of orange, pineapple and passion fruit which was a little too orangey but still yummy. Even with all my improvisations, it was a hit but I can't wait to make it the "right" way next time.

I made this as a first course for my wedding-night dinner and added 1/2 a grilled lobster tail. Delightful. Tonight I'm grilling scallops and shrimp instead. can't wait! this is a simple and wonderful recipe on it's own, the seafood is a great addition!

wonderful salad. very fruity and light. great with lightly pan fried prawns to make it a whole meal. mmmMMMm

Ah, this was magnificent! Even in spite of my inferior mangoes and using the Welch's "passion fruit juice blend concentrate." I could still taste the passion fruit, even though it was almost the last ingredient in the concentrate. Everything else I did exactly as written, except that I used less of the mesclun herb mix (I wanted plenty of toppings). I've never heard people rave about a salad so much...it was unbelievable. I doubled the recipe and it served 11 people with a little left over.

This is a fantastic summer salad! Go light on the dressing and heavy on the mango and avocado. I used mixed baby greens and added slivered basil which gave a nice clean taste. Also added some toasted pine nuts for crunch. The Welch's passion fruit frozen concentrate isn't pure passion fruit, but still tastes great if you can't find the real stuff.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have served it at a girls' luncheon with grilled shrimp to make it a whole meal. It's light, refreshing, somewhat healthy, and delicious!

This was so good! I couldn't find passion fruit concentrate but was able to find passion fruit preserves in the latin section of the market...added about 2 Tbs. and it was really delicious! I took another cook's advice and added toasted pine nuts also. This was a big hit with my guests.

This salad was absolutely delicious. Didn't have sherry wine vinegar so i used sherry and champaigne vinegar. I also added toated pecans and sprinkled freshly shopped mint on top. The mint was definately a nice touch.

great relatively easy salad. used juice rather than concentrate and red wine vinegar instead of sherry. Turned out great. Need to at least double recipe. Added pine nuts too. Yum!

We made this as the salad course of a vegan meal. The mango and avocado flavors made for a nice pairing. The salad dressing was excellent as well, although I would have made more dressing for the 4 servings. For the salad mix, we used a combination of frisee, endive, watercress, and arugula. Beyond increasing the dressing, I would suggest adding something crunchy such as toasted pine nuts or possibily candied walnuts.

Holy Crap! I made this salad as part of a menu for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day, and Wow! You could even add some roast pork tenderloin medallions and make it an entree salad...

i thought the passion fruit juice concentrate would be hard to find, but Welch's makes it and it was available at a large, chain supermarket. fantastic salad!

i made this salad tonight for a dinner party where the entree was an indian curry. it was fantastic and a big hit with everyone. the coriander seeds were kind of big. i may crush them more next time. a great salad. with chicken, it could be an entree salad.

This was simply delicious. It is one of the only salads that is this good that would work for spring, summer, or fall. The different flavors of this salad are perfect and just melt in your mouth. I couldn't find passion fruit so I used fresh mango chutney instead, it worked great. Make sure the avocado is ripe, and use a good herb mesclun. Definitly try it!

Too cook from Nova Scotia: No need to discard the coriander seed husks. The recipe states to coarsely grind them and you can easily do that with a mortar and pestle, much as you would whole peppercorns. Ground/powdered coriander is also available if you prefer a finer/smoother texture but is often not as flavourful. Cheers!

I have to confess I haven't made this recipe but I do have a question. My favorite spices are coriander and cumin. I was given a jar of whole coriander seeds but was unsure how to use them. I crushed them but thought the husks should be disgarded. Any comments?

We really enjoyed this recipe. The fresh mango and avocado were perfect with the sweet papaya flavor. Will definitely make this one again.

This one got raves from my husband. He particularly liked the depth given to the viniagrette by the crushed coriander seed. So elegant and easy..just what I like to find in a recipe. We ate this between the two of us..would definitely double the recipe for entertaining.

A delightful salad with fresh/bright flavours and an excellent dressing. I had fresh passion fruit which I mashed to a fine pulp, then whisked in the remaining vinaigrette ingredients. Gently tossed avocado with a squeeze of lemon juice to prevent discoloration. A treat for the eyes and the palate, this salad is a true winner!
