This is my absolute favorite marinade for salmon and other fish fillets. It is so quick to prepare and keeps for a few days in the refrigerator. It is great for single people like me as you can cut it down to enough for one or two fillets.

I used this on a halibut fillet and it was very good, but the real treat came from simmering the marinade and using it for dipping with a sourdough bread. It was delicious. Try it.

this was delicious, but one has to know if your guests like the taste of pernod or licorice. we do, so i thought it was great. try to check it out first, before the trouble.
