I saw amaranth - a very beautiful leafy green at the farmer's market, and decided to pick it up remembering I had seen a recipe for it, or I could use it as a centerpiece - it is that pretty. Followed recipe exactly using whole wheat phyllo and it was very good, probably could use another green and it would be as tasty.
