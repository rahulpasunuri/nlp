I made this for a holiday party back in 2000. I still have the original page taken from the magazine back then...very delicious, just like I remembered. I am making it again for christmas dessert.

I made this dessert when it first appeared for a friend and her family who LOVES chocolate. This is not an easy dessert to make (as one reviewer stated) and requires quite a bit of time. I used a 10" springform pan and lined it with two layers of parchemnt, then sprayed it with a non-stick spray. This greatly helped removal from the pan. I removed the cake from the pan after it had cooled (placed it on the serving platter)and then refrigerated it overnight. This cake WOWED my friend and her family. It is VERY rich and a small slice went a long way.

Has anyone tried making this without the water bath? No matter how much heavy duty foil I use to wrap the pan, there is always leakage & I end up with a soggy crust! Thanks for your help.

I've made this twice and both times I've used Kahlua instead of chocolate liqeuer - it's great and it reinforces the coffee flavor even more!

This is a great recipe. Have made it serveral times now always with a great response! A suggestion for easier servering. Try using parchment paper on the bottom of the pan. Simply spray pan like recipe says then add parchment paper that is a little bigger in diameter than pan bottom. Once paper is in place spray it too. Then proceed as recipe says. Should be a little easier to remove from pan bottom and move to a serving tray.

I have made this dessert several times for dinner parties and it is always a great hit with the chocolate lovers!

I've made this twice now, and it's gotten rave reviews both times. This most recent time, I changed all the coffee ingredients to mint, and it was fabulous. I decorated it with crushed candy canes. I plan to try it with all sorts of other flavors: orange,coconut, amaretto. My one problem is that I can't get it off the springform bottom. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to avoid having to serve it from the springform bottom?

I have been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it. I have one problem. The top layer of chocolate always falls right off when I slice it. Can anyone tell me what I may be doing wrong?

I made this custard dessert and an Angel Food cake for a large family birthday celebration and WOW!! The response I received was "awesome cakes", "great flavor" "good combination (one light tasting and one with lots of chocolate flavor", "nice change from a traditional birthday cake", "great choice for us chocolate lovers". This custart tart is a little on the time consuming but worth the effort!

This recipe serves as a good base for an interesting dessert. To elevate the interest, be sure to cut the heavy chocolate flavor with a touch fruit. I used orange liquor instead of chocolate. I also garnished with candied orange rind. The orange workedd well with the mocha. This is a fairly easy recipe, especially if you like making cheesecakes.

This is chocolate and coffee lover's dream. Light mousse-like filling with an intense coffee flavor. I used Cafe Bustelo instant coffee and it worked out well. However, it is a time-consuming recipe so don't fool yourself if you are also cooking a complete dinner.

This was one of my favorite recipes. It always is a hit. For those that don't enjoy the coffee flavor I substituted a indivdual serving packet of chocolate raspberry cocoa mix in place of the unsweetened cocoa powder and replaced the chocolate liqueur for the raspberry liqueur such as chambord.

I might be tempted to rename this "Oreo chocolate cream pie" for all the sophisication it turned out to have. It was just a little too much effort for a not very grown-up dessert. It was yummy - but I would not make it for a dinner party that's for sure!

I have made this dessert twice and both times it was a hit! I substituted regular instant coffee for the expresso powder. I did not use the coffee flavoring for the ganache just in case the coffee taste was too strong and it worked well.

Excellent recipe. Several friends told me this was the best dessert they'd ever tasted.

Of the "thousands" of desserts I have made from Bon Appetit, I would put this one in the top 10. I can't imagine making it without the coffee flavor. One suggestion, after you spread the ganache on the tart let it chill for a half hour or more before using your icing comb---works much better.

wish recipe developers would not assume most people like the flavor of coffee. This was good without the coffee.
