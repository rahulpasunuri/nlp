I doubled the amount of gremolata, then mixed the cooked beans with about 1 1/2 C of cooked adzuki beans to make a vegetarian main course. Served it with polenta, though it would be good with millet too. Tasty and nutritious.

Very tasty and nice-looking. They didn't have wax beans at the market, so I had to settle for just green beans. I think the combination of wax and green beans would look great, and make this a nice side dish for a fancy company dinner.

I thought the idea was good, but not a huge fan of the way it turned out. The parsley didn't like sharing the plate with the beans. I tried it with basil again and it turned out much better.

This is an easy tasty way to serve beans. I used wax beans from my garden. I would definitely make this recipe again.
