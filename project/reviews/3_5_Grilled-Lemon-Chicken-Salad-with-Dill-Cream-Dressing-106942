Recipe took entirely too long. Gave up midway, and baked the chicken in the marinade. Added mayo/sour cream dressing on top to serve. Delicious. Used plain yogurt in lieu of sour cream. Fondly, your lazy cook.

Loved it! Left out the olives, doubled and lightly sauteed the shallots, and added some chopped dried apricots and blue cheese crumbles. Even better the second day!

Great chilled in the summer.

This was a great make-ahead recipe for a 50th anniversary party. I served it with a beef tenderloin with cabernet sauce and it was a good combination. The marinade of the chicken was wonderful, and the sicilian olives in the salad adds a great punch to the salad. Followed the recipe exactly, and proportions were great.

This was a great main course for a baby shower lunch I recently hosted. I added roasted pistachios and grilled the potatoes along with the other stuff and it gave it a wonderful smoky and crunchy flavor. We also found it tasted much better at room temp and on the second day.

made this dish as chicken with potato salad on the side. Potato salad is definitely a keeper. I did dark meat in the oven basting with the marinade. the skin tasted fabulous but the dark meat was too much for the marinade. Next time I will use breasts as suggested. Still very easy and tasty with items that I always have on hand.

Very good, ideal for a stylish summer lunch. Agreed it was a bit time-consuming to make, but dill sauce can be made ahead, and would go nicely with grilled or smoked salmon, or similar fish, as well. I substituted grilled peppers and chopped walnuts for the celery and green olives as didn't have on hand/husband olive hater, as well as juice of one lime to substitute for some of the lemon juice. Next day, I added some chopped black olives and stuffed inside pita bread with some salad leaves....makes a great sandwich.

I thought this was absolutely fantastic. I love chicken salad, and I thought the potatoes and olives were a wonderful twist on an old favorite. The marinade for the chicken is great for everday grilling, too. I have made this several times, and it has gotten rave reviews every time. Even my two-year-old loves it!!

This was okay but not that good. I was a little unsure of the directions- was this supposed to be served at room temp? I decided to make it a cold salad and it didn't go well that way. However, the chicken was great after it had been grilled with that marinade. If I were ever to make any part of this recipe again it would just be the chicken.

This recipe was time consuming but really good. I added chopped garlic to the dressing for a little more flavor. The zucchini was good but I don't think it added much to the recipe. Would probably skip that part to save time.

A great summer salad. I loved the potatoes steamed and have adopted this technique for making potato salad, as well--keeps the potatoes from getting too mushy. I pounded the chicken breasts to even thickness so they would cook more evenly. Very attractive and tasty.

I also thought this was a bit of work, but it was very tasty. I loved the broiled zucchini alongside the chicken salad. I used yogurt instead of sour cream, and less olive oil.

This dish was okay. My husband enjoyed it more than I did. I think that it was more work that it was worth. The marinade is good though.

Very good and summery salad. The marinade was delicious so we actually ate half of the chicken breast when just grilled with lemon-butter green beans and we refrigerated the other half for the following day to do with half of the salad recipe. What a delicious way to save time!!! I thought I was a little bit short on the mayonnaise, so next time I will do 1 1/2 of the dressing recipe.
