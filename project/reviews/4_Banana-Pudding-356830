This is a great beginning. I agree with others -it needed more "good" banana flavor. I've made this four times in two weeks- tweeking the recipe each time to get better flavor. I took an idea from Cook's Illustrated (a banana bread recipe) and captured banana juice from fresh very ripe bananas. I peeled four very ripe bananas, broke them into pieces, microwaved them on a plate -covered with plastic wrap - for 4 minutes. The bananas seem to melt, but there is about 1/2 cup of juice on the plate. I strain the bananas (discard the solids) and collect the juice. Then, I reduced the "banana juice" on the stove top to about 3 tablespoons. I use the reduced banana juice and 1 tablespoon of "99 Bananas" liquor. I add all this after the pudding is off the heat. I followed all other directions and ingredients. The banana flavor is excellent and not artificial.

Love this recipe! I just use the pudding part - love to mix it up using different liqueurs (such as Kahlua) or stirring in peanut butter. Easy to double if you need a large batch.

31/2 forks really. I would add more banana liqueur next time...do not use banana flavoring. Tried that once in a recipe and it tasted so artificial. The crumble really makes this special.

I made this for a Valentines Day dessert and it was fantastic! I made homemade banana liqueur from a recipe I found online, which was fun. I did use an extra tablespoon of the liqueur. The pudding texture is divine and the crumble is genius.

Made this for my husband's birthday dinner. He said it was the best banana pudding he ever had. With the liqueur and toasted crust, it is Banana Pudding for Grown-ups! Made it as written, except added a few more cookies to the crumble & put all the crumble ingredients in the processor. Easy!

I've made this recipe many times now for the filling for banana cream pie. I make 2x this recipe a day ahead along with the pie crust and chill both (separately). To assemble the pie, I layer pudding and sliced bananas in the crust, beginning and ending with pudding. I top it with sweetened whipped cream. (One cup heavy cream whipped with about a quarter cup of confectioners' sugar.) I skip the crumble but you could make a crust from the same ingredients.

Very good pudding. However, I used the banana flavoring against my better judgment. Artificial flavoring has a strange aftertaste, so I will definitely leave it out next time. Everyone loved the crispy topping. Delicious!

Very filling recipe I found. I split open a vanilla bean and threw it in with the milk well it simmered.

This is definitely a delicious recipe for banana pudding fans! I made it as written with the exception of a couple of previous reviewers' suggestions (cut the sugar to 1/3c, mixed the sliced bananas into the pudding instead of putting them at the bottom of individual bowls, used Bailey's in place of banana liquour but only 1 TBsp). The toasted wafer crumb topping was the best part for me! I just threw the wafers in the food processor along with the cinnamon, sugar, salt and processed to a course crumb before mixing in the melted butter by hand and toasting it in an 8x8 pan in the oven, and that worked great, it was just a little faster for me since I doubled the recipe. This was a huge hit in my house!

I used this recipe for a very special banana cream pie. Most recipes for the pie use a vanilla pudding, with layers of banana. Used chocolate wafers for the crust, then a layer of sliced bananas, pudding, and topped with barely sweetened whipped cream. The best banana cream pie ever!

I made this as written using banana liqueur and Tahitian vanilla. The table fell silent as we were eating the pudding with the exception of moans of pleasure and the sound of spoons against glass as we carefully scraped up every last bit from ourbowls.DamGood!

Delicious! I used brandy extract in place of the banana extract. I also added sliced bananas into the pudding. I didn't want to waste the egg whites so I whipped up a meringue with a little sugar and vanilla extract, put it on top of the pudding with the crumbled topping on that, and baked until the meringue solidified. (about 10 minutes) To die for!!!

This is a great recipe. I had a ton of leftover bananas, so I followed the suggestion of adding a mashed banana into the pudding. I also used Crown instead of banana liquer and topped with crisped up Walkers shortbread instead of Vanilla Wafers as a faux pie crust. So amazing!

I made this tonight minus the topping.It thickened up very well I walked away from it for only a few seconds while it was thickening up during it's second round in the pan and lumps started to form very quickly while I was away! So I recommend to keep whisking without stopping until it thickens during its second time back into the pan. After a lot of whisking the lumps that began forming seemed to disappear. Much to my dismay I realized I had forgotten to add the sugar to this nice thick pudding, so in a last ditch effort to save it I squeezed about 1/3c. honey into the pan after adding the butter and vanilla.{I used honey because I was afraid sugar wouldn't disolve if I added it at that late stage!} As some others also did, I subbed rum for banana booze. 3 Tbls. rum was overpowering.The results were still good and I know they will be even better next time when I remember to add sugar and use the recomended banana liquer. This is now a 'keeper' recipe for using up my excess over ripe bananas!!

I made this for a friends wedding potluck reception. It was amazingly easy to put together, I added more bananas than the recipe called for and it tasted heavenly! Make this at least a day ahead, the flavors will deepen the next day. Got a lot of compliments on it!

This recipe is awesome, fool proof and delicious. I've made the pudding twice now. The first time, I didn't have vanilla wafers or banana liquor. So, I mashed in the bananas directly into the pudding and used Baily's Irish Creme instead of banana liquor. I also didn't add the crumbly topping. The second time, I made the recipe exactly written. I have to say, I actually preferred the first variation, as it was less sweet and the flavor of the alcohol was strong and yummy. Both times my guests gobbled down the pudding, and commented on what an amazing chef I was (score!).

Fantastic. Get the banana liquor, it is worth the tasty results. Tried with 1/3 c sugar and tried with 1/4 c, definitely use 1/3 as 1/4 isn't enough in my opinion. Enjoy.

FInally I've found the perfect banana pudding recipe. Smooth, creamy and delicious.

We received a case of bananas as a fruit of the month gift and I was looking for something other than banana bread to make. So far I have made this recipe twice. Since I also did not have banana liquor on hand, I substituted Bermuda Rum which complimented the bananas beautifully. After the pudding cools, it gives it an interesting flavor.

A hit at the Masonic dinner I brought it to (none leftover). I doubled the recipe by half, cut the sugar as the other recommendations did (1/3 cup) and added a bit extra banana liquor (did not give an alcohol taste, which I hate, but enhanced the banana flavor). I'll be using this as my pudding recipe for years to come!

I was looking for a traditional "Southern" dessert to serve after an informal Mardi Gras dinner and this was FABULOUS! Like the other reviewer, I didn't have any banana liquer on hand, but didn't miss it in the final product, as the flavor from the diced bananas came through beautifully in the dessert. I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and thought it was plenty sweet. I am fortunate to have access to free-range eggs and raw whole milk and the color of the pudding was gorgeous. The crumbs raise this dessert to the level of the sublime! If you think just throwing in some crushed Nilla wafers would be easier, you'll miss the boat! The combination of the cinnamon and that little touch of salt toasted w/the butter. MMMMM!

I was a bit nervous about this recipe as my husband and I are big fans of traditional banana pudding with the wafers and bananas in the pudding. It was GREAT! The topping was really yummy and had just enough salt in it to make it interesting. I couldn't find banana liqueur so I just omitted it - totally fine with just vanilla. A couple suggestions: Cut the sugar (1/4-1/3 C) - too sweet! Double the recipe for many eaters or larger appetites!
