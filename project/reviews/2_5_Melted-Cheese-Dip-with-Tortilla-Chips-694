After reading everyone else's modifications (thanks), I did some pretty serious changes and it turned out great. I skipped the flour entirely. Added diced green chiles and a freshly chopped green pepper and green onions. Adobo from Penzey's spices (love the adobo!) and I added sausage. I put it all in a crock pot and it's a hit! For beer I used bud light, seemed to work out for us!

Literally just made this recipe a few minutes ago because we're having people over tomorrow and I wanted to do a test run. It was delicious! I actually picked up Jalapeno Jack cheese from Trader Joe's, and used a light Mexican beer. The cheese was spicy enough that I didn't need to add Jalapeno, and tomorrow I look forward to adding cilantro and seeing how it comes out. But overall, tastes great and is about the easiest recipe I've ever tried.(And a great recipe if you have an aversion to Veleveeta!)

I'm going to try making this receipe again with a lighter beer. It wasn't bad with a dark beer, it just had a funny aftertaste. Not a real crowd pleaser.

This recipe sounded good on paper and came out to a nice consistancy but tasted bland. I used several jalapenos, crushed red peppers and a can or roasted green chilis to kick it up and it had only a mild heat and flavor. It wasn't bad and seemed hotter the longer it stood but wasn't anything I would make again.

Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I have made this several times and it's such a hit. Although, I do remember the first time I made it with the wrong beer and it was horrible. Try using Corona or any mexican beer- might make a difference. I also make mine with pepper jack to give it an extra kick.

Looks like a pseudo-Swiss Fondue from the southwest, which might benefit from adding roasted sweet red peppers. I wouldn't waste my time and money when there are better recipes around. Instead try layering in a heatproof bowl canned chili (w/o beans) refried beans---salsa--velveeta or processed cheese-- chopped green onions--(green peppers/chilies--chopped) sour cream ---top with grated sharp cheddar cheese. Microwave until cheese melts. Serve with tortilla chips.

This was bad...I am eating my recipe as I write this and it is always a hit....Mix equal part of extra sharp cheddr with velveeta---melt in a double boiler. Add in one chopped tomato, 1/2 chopped raw onion, handful of chopped parsley, and finely chopped jalapeno pepper (from a jar is what I use). Let it all melt together and it becomes a creamy, sharp, fabulous Mexican dip that your friends will come to expect from you! Serve w/ totilla chips.

I imagined the Mexican cheese dip my mother made with Velveeta and thought this could only be better with real cheese, but I would recommend the Velveeta version. This was lumpy and expensive and not very well-received.

i made this at a christmas party a year ago. fell in love with the dip. easy to make. i think i did add a can of rotel to it to give it more zing. i enjoyed it and my guests enjoyed it, as well. planning on making it again for this year's party.

The recipe looked great but was a tremendous disappointment. I expected it to taste similar to a dip at a favorite local authentic Mexican restaurant. It was a waste of ingredients. It was terribly bland, & left an aftertaste of the raw flour. I asked a friend to taste it, and she made the same observations that I did. I would have been embarrassed to serve it to my guests. I threw it out.

Made this on the stove then transfered to a crock pot. Great party dip. I added two cans of diced green chiles and one large fresh jalapeno,came out nice and spicy.

I'd make this again, but it needed more flavor. I used all the jalapeno's suggested, plus, and still found it to be bland. I put about 1/2 cup of scallions in to spice it up and all my guests liked it. I think this just needs to be tailored to peoples'individual tastes.

Actually, I cheated a bit -- one of my guests couldn't eat spicy food at this time, so I substituted 1 tsp cumin seed, which I ground and stirred in with the cheese. It was sensational.

This was very good but the weirdest thing happened when I was cutting the chilies -- my mouth quite literally felt like it had caught fire!!! Maybe it's just me (I've never cooked with chili peppers before), but next time I would definitely wear rubber gloves when cutting those pesky chilies!

We love this dip! I serve it in a fondue pot, and when I serve it as an appetizer, people often fill up on it instead of waiting for the main course.
