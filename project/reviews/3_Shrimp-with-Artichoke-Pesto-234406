Excellent. I used tinned artichokes, so it was fast and easy.

I made this pesto dip and found it ok at best. I don't know what people see in this dip. I have had artichoke dips that were much much better. It was a waste of very good shrimp.

delicious - acidulated water keeps the artichoke from browning (like fennel, or apples) and yes, its raw. thats how pestos are generally made. after living and professionally cooking in italy for years, raw ingredients are primarily used in pestos - rarely is anything cooked. rawness = stronger, more pronounced flavor. :D

Made this a few nights ago. I noticed when I read the instructions that it seemed odd to go to all the work of making acidulated water, and not cooking the artichokes! Obviously an oversight. Because of all the waste, I recommend using baby artichokes, which would work even better. I've got a few ravioli and pasta sauces made with the baby artichokes, I'm going to do this recipe with them next time. Love the new twist on pesto!

I have also been making pesto for years. I can also read. The recipe calls for 1 cup of packed basil. Not 2 as Marv stated. As an accomplished Chef, I have learned that most all recipes are in need of a little "tweaking" in order for them to fit my tastes. I shall give this recipe a try and "tweak" as needed.

Question to the cook in Cairo, Egypt ~ how can you rate this recipe with a fork rating if you have not tried it? Throws the system off, don't you think?

This recipe does not mention cooking the artichoke hearts. Does this mean to use them raw?

I've been making pesto for years and find the amounts in this recipie Bizzare. With 2 cups of packed basil you would need about 1 head of garlic, not one clove, and at least half a cup of grated cheese. Also using a food proccesser for pesto ruins the techture. A mezzaluna is far preferable.

In order to keep your pesto a vibrant green color, plunge the basil leaves boiling water momentarily, then immediately into ice water. Drain well, then follow this or any other pesto recipe. You would have to ask Alton Brown why, but it works.

Actually, pesto does not have to be made with fresh produce. The base is always some kind of leafy herb like basil, parsley or cilantro, and then combined with garlic, olive oil and a hard cheese like parmesan and sometimes roasted pine nuts. The versatility of pesto is what makes it adaptable to different pastas, meats, or even used as a dip like this recipe. For example, you could take out the artichoke and mix the pesto with roasted peppers (red or yellow makes a nice color) or sun-dried tomatoes. I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I imagine with some creativity the artichoke shell could be used to hold the dip.

I made the oven roasted artichokes from the same article and then used the left-overs in the pesto. I spread the pesto over poached salmon on a bed of raw spinach and blanched asparagus for an salad to pack for lunch. The pesto is delicious spread on almost anything!

I made this dish with canned artichoke hearts and it was absolutely delicious. I've used the leftover artichoke pesto and it is very tasty on just about anything. Better yet, it was easy and quick to make, and inexpensive, yet elegant. I highly recommend it!

Pesto may be made from raw ingredients, but I would always cook an artichoke before attempting to use it in any recipe...it may be awfully "tuff" otherwise!

Yes you would use raw artichoke in a pesto sauce. Any pesto dish is made with raw produce.

Huh? You're going to discard everything but artichoke hearts? What a waste. Buy canned artichoke hearts and save yourself a lot of trouble.

I don't see any indication in the recipe to cook the artichoke hearts. Is it really made with the raw artichoke?! Has anyone tried this?

I don't understand-the artichoke is raw??
