Love the dressing. I prefer toasted almonds.

To my surprise because of the great reviews, I actually did not like this dressing. I thought it tasted more like a sauce that I would put on shortcake!

I omittd the apples completely, used mandarin orange slces, and almonds instead of walnuts. I also used a bit softer goat cheese & rolled it into little balls, and added a dash of amaretto to the dressing & lowerd the sugar.

It's kind of impossible not to love a combination of walnuts, dried cranberries and goat cheese, but I've had them in better salads. The vinaigrette was interesting but just okay with the salad. It was a little too delicate for such strong flavors, I think. The color was lovely, though. The marinated apples went nicely with the salad. They were more on par as far as intensity with the rest of the ingredients. I let them marinate for the full 6 hours and I really liked the way the texture softened slightly and the complexity of the infused flavor. I would make this salad again, but with a different dressing. I served this as a salad course, but with a sliced of freshly baked bread on the side, this salad is a fine meal.

I love this fruity salad and make it often. I marinate the apples in grape juice with a few splashes of vinegar. I also add 1 sliced strawberry per plate. Goat cheese is sick, so I omit that. Mmm!

I made this for Thanksgiving and was quite pleased with it. I substituted pecans for walnuts and used about twice the volume of nuts called for. I'm not sold on the marinated apples, but they weren't bad. I also added a few blueberries and raspberries for festiveness, but they tasted a little washed out in comparison to the dressing. However, the combination of textures and flavors between the goat cheese, dressing, nuts, and cranberries worked really well, and I'm looking forward to making it again.

This was delicious. Prepared as directed, this has a delightful combination of flavors. The dressing is a little shocking looking next to the spinach, but the addition of the cheese, walnuts, apples, and cranberries balance it a bit. Don't leave out the apples. No need to marinate them for as long as directed-20 minutes was good enough- but try the apple vinaigrette. The cinnamon was a very nice touch. Received dozens of compliments and no one believed me when I said the dressing was fat-free. This disappeared very, very quickly.

This was a wonderful, light salad. I was not originally planning to make this particular recipe, but I misplaced my original recipe and found this one online. I did not use the apples (but will try next time). Made vinaigrette as directed except used a bit less sugar because the strawberries were so sweet. I also used slivered almonds because that was all I had and omitted the cranberries (didn't have). it was wonderful and you could not tell there was no oil in the dressing. very good.

I prepared this salad for a large group of half men, and half women. I noticed that the men looked suspiciously at it, but did put it on their plate. They all came back for second helpings and loved it!

The flavor was good but I did not care for the look of the dressing on the spinach; it was not appealing.

I am so suspicious of oil-free dressings, but this was wonderful! I'm not sure either if marinating the apples was necessary. Love a healthy AND great-tasting recipe.

Absolutely delicious! This was the best part of our meal! I marinated the apples and there is planty of the (very tasty) cider vinaigrette leftover for more salads. I will definitely make this dish again and again!

This recipe is great, I also have used slice pears, not marinated in anything. The flavors are great.

The Strawberry Champagne Vinaigrette adds a wonderful light flavor to the salad. It is the perfect salad for a hot summer day.

This is a great, quick salad, although I left out the apples. I used a lot less sugar in the dressing, maybe a teaspoon, and it was delicious.

Great refreshing summer salad! Didn't have champaign vinegar so I used 2tbs of rice wine vinegar and 2 tbs of lemon seltzer. Also thought the dressing was too sweet so I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon and 1 tbs of lemon zest. We had left over grilled chicken brest so I sliced it and put it on top. Husband can't stop raving!

this was lovely although I've since made it with just plain Granny Smith apple slices without having marinated them and it was still very good. My family bickered over who would get the scant leftovers. I've made it several times since with dried cherries when cranberries weren't in the pantry, and toasted some slivered almonds in a dry fry pan. The feta, especially if you use goat feta, adds a silkiness to this that's exceptional. And I love the fact that there's no oil in this dressing.

This is like a Taste of Spring! I loved this dish...The dressing is light and Fresh. It matches Perfectly with the Goat Cheese and Nuts!!!

Read carefully. The apples are not to be marinated in apple cider vinegar, but instead in Apple Cider Vinaigrette. The ingredient name's color, and different font tips you off that it's a link to a recipe that is used in this recipe.

I really liked the salad, it was very interesting. My husband was abivalent, and my mother hated it. I would probably change the apple portion of the recipe and not marinate the apple. I used apple cider vinegar with olive oil for the marinade, and the apple tasted too vinegary.If I make it again, I won't marinate the apple. I will just use water and lemon juice to prevent discoloration. The strawberry dressing was excellent.

This salad was really lovely... it had the spinach greens but then a lot of substance with the walnuts, cranberries and goats cheese. I also made extra strawberry champagne vinegarette to serve on the side for those that wanted a little more of that flavour on their spinach. It went down a storm!
