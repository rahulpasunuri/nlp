If you are going to invest 3 hours you can do much, much better than this. First, roast the stock ingredients in a 500 degree oven to carmelize them. Second, use a slow cooker to simmer the ingredients in the water. This allows you to set the slow cooker up and walk away for 3 or up to 6 hours. This recipe is too lame to be added to a gournet site. Shame on you.

Very bland stock that can be used for any well seasoned recipe calling for chicken stock.I like to have it on hand and most importantly it is extremely easy to make
