I used a ginger jam because I couldn't find the ginger spread at a store near me. Next time, I will puree the jam first. I didn't mind the chunks of ginger flavor wise, but I didn't like the texture in the ice cream. Other than that, it was absolutely delicious. I had this flavor at the Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco last summer and it tasted just like it!

leftover ginger spread can be used in lots of ways, either savory or sweet. Use your imagination to use up unusual ingredients. No need to discard anything, just takes a little 'thinking'

how can you write a review of a recipe that you haven't even made? Don't rate the validity of a recipe based on an ingredient list. It's supposed to be based on final taste and ease or complexity. Sheesh.

This looks great, but I hate when a recipe calls for an ingredient (1 tsp ginger spread) and you have to buy it and you know the rest will go to waste.
