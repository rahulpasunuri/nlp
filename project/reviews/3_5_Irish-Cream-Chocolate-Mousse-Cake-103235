This cake was so disappointing! Mousse turned out great but the cake was flat and rubbery and impossible to cut. It took such a long time to make, and ultimately a waste of time. I'd make the mousse again with a different cake recipe.

For those who had problems cutting even layers, buy a cake leveler or "saw." Wilton makes one; it costs only a few dollars and even an amateur can easily use it: http://www.amazon.com/Wilton- 415-815-Cake-Leveler/dp/B00004S7YB.

I first made this cake ten years ago for a party. It was a smashing success! I make it every couple of years, and each time it is just as delicious as the first time. For the reviewer who found the cake rubbery, that is because this kind of cake is what the French call "biscuit" (beese-KWEE). It does come out a bit dry and rubbery--for a purpose. It must absorb the moistening syrup. If you moisten the layers then wrap them in Saran Wrap individually for several hours or overnight, they will be evenly moistened for assembly.

The mousse was terrfic, but the cake was disappointing. Beating the eggs for such a long time resulted in a flat cake that at first was too delicate to cut, and then got somewhat rubbery, but was better the second day after soaking in the whisky sauce. The espresso powder also gives an unappetizing greyish cast to the cake. I would make this again, but use a different chocolate cake with the mousse.

This was both beautiful and delicious! It really surprised our friends as I am not known for such fancy desserts. It took time but the directions were clear and easy to follow.

I had made this cake about two years ago for a co-worker's birthday and everyone loved it. At the time, I would have considered myself a novice baker. The chocolate strips for the side was a bit of a challenge for me. I then had issues with shaving the chocolate for the top because my hands are always very warm, it kept melting on me. I believe I used the Wilton wire cake cutter to slice the cake into the layers that I needed, or at least to mark where I needed to cut. After adding the syrup to the cake, that moistened it quite a bit and then with the mousse, it was even better. I would consider this an advanced cake but it was a great challenge for me to play with. I'm getting ready to make another one tomorrow for Thanksgiving.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day dinner party. Recipe was a bit intimidating but the directions were clear if one followed them step by step. Cake was the best I've ever made.

The cake was good, but not amazing. I didn't have a 9in spring form, so I divided the cake into 3 different 9in pans (with shorter sides). The texture was a little weird in the cake part, i wasn't too fond of the irish whisky syrup (but that could be because I divided up the mix?). In the end, I thought the flavors didn't tie together too well. A definite must try though, for the proffessional baking experience

Moussse tasted fine, but egg and sugar mixture thickened too quickly (eggs began to harden in smallish pea-like chunks) and I should have stopped at 140 degrees as another writer mentioned; the cake portion is in the oven right now and is looking like a total disaster!! Gloppy eggs mess. I wasn't encouraged when I put it in the oven. I couldn't find expresso or coffee powder in the 3 different stores I stopped in. I doubt the mousse can save this cake. I'm looking for a different cake recipe to salvage this before St Pat's party tomorrow afternoon.

This recipe is intended for a professional pastry chef, IMO. As I read through to the part about the bands, I realized I was in over my head and opted to make just the mousse instead. It was great although next time I might add a tad more Bailey's as you could barely taste it. Not sure if this would throw the whole thing off.

Just wanted to comment on splitting the cake into layers. Yes, a serrated knife is a must, but not "seriously long". The trick is to wrap the cooled cake in plastic wrap and freeze it until firm. (Not a must, but very helpful...don't worry about loss of moisture since you're brushing with syrup anyway). To cut it, hold the knife firmly and rotate the cake while pressing the knife inward. That way you'll be more likely to get an even cut (make sure you hold it level), and you'll slowly work toward the middle, rather than sawing back and forth. It's easiest to do with a rotating cake stand, but you can also do it by putting the cake on something flat (like a cardboard cake circle, or the base of a springform pan), and elevating it on a large can of tomatoes or something. Hope this helps!

Tried the mousse and it worked out well. I first whipped the cream and transferred it to the refrigerator, then I worked on the egg custard and only then I melted the chocolate. When the chocolate was just a little above luke warm I transferred it to the egg custard mixture. It mixed in rather well and I did not get small chunks of chocolate in the mousse. I did find that the egg mixture thickened up quite quickly while being whisked in the double boiler. I did watch the temperature but it became very thick at 140 degrees F so I stopped the process and went on with the recipe. This might be nice with Amaretto and some cherries thrown in somehow. The chocolate bands are, in my opinion, totally unnecessary as the chocolate mousse frosting is so very rich, it comes in at 700 calories per cup, the equivalent of butter. Enough is enough.

Just tested the cake part of this recipe and it came out well. I have yet to test the mousse part of the recipe. Small caution, you need a seriously long serrated knife to cut the cake into three horizontal layers. The danger is that you could turn your cake into a pile of crumbs without the proper knife. Also, it would have been helpful if the author of the recipe would have indicated whether the eggs should have been room temperature at time they were combined with the sugar and beaten. I assumed room temperature was correct and the cake seemed to turn out just fine. Looking forward to testing the mousse.

I am testing this dessert with an eye to serving it at a formal dinner I am hosting next week. I made the cake and, overall, was pleased with the results. Small warning, I had trouble cutting the cake into three horizontal layers. You need to have a seriously long serrated knife to do so. The danger is that you can turn the cake into a pile of crumbs. Next time I think I will just use two layers, which can easily be cut from the original cake. Otherwise the cake was perfect for this recipe, light and airy and suitable for absorbing the whisky syrup. Also, I let the eggs come to room temperature before beating with the sugar. It would have been helpful if the author of the recipe would have said something about the temperature of the ingredients of the cake. I had to assume room temperature was proper, but, maybe chilled would have been better, who knows?

One of the best dessert recipes I have made. A very easy recipe to make even though it looks time consuming

Fabulous!

This did take a long time to make, but it was divine. However, the directions are incorrect. The mousse needs to reach 160 degrees, not 60 degrees. There is another copy of this recipe on the site with the correct instructions.

My husband loved this cake!! One big slice of cake wasn't enough for him and had to have the 2nd slice.

This cake is very time consuming but well worth the effort. It has great flavor but make sure you chill the mousse completely. Definitely a favorite. I have made it several times for special occasions.
