Delicious! The combo of fresh Italian parsley and fresh basil adds an extra dimension to an already flavorful dish. I used half the amount of pasta and thought the amount of sauce was perfect. I also used a little less olive oil. While the red wine vinegar definitely enhanced the dish, I would use a tiny bit less next time.

I like all the ingredients in this, but really did not like this sauce. It was so "harsh" and awful tasting to us, that I decided to cook the sauce in a sautee pan for about 10 mins to mellow it. It was at least edible, but a total waste of my beautiful, home- grown tomatoes.

This is a wonderful recipe, which we look forward to every summer when tomatoes are at their best. The only change I make is to gently simmer the garlic in the olive oil before adding to the other ingredients. I let the whole works macerate on the counter while I cook the pasta - the tomatoes produce enough juice that adding extra pasta water isn't necessary. Served with freshly grated Parmesan, it's sublime!

Good for a summer pasta meal -- next time, we'll replace the parsley with fresh oregano and/or thyme (parsely was too bitter).

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic. This is a super tasty dish with intense flavors - loved it! Very easy to make and satisfying.

This was great. I agree with others--it came together really quickly. I put the water on before I prepared the sauce and it all timed out perfectly. I used some pasta water as directed, but I don't feel it was necessary. The tomatoes, vinegar and oil provided plenty of liquid.

Delicious!I made the recipe as directed but used Roma Tomatoes.Also used fresh pasta purchased at my local Pasta Shop. Would follow suggestions next time re sauteeing the garlic first. Easy to prepare yet has a great flavour.I will try it again when tomatoes are in season as well as the basil.

Delicious, I cooked the sauce and added 1 tabspn of hot sauce and 2 chopped green chilies, and didn't add the anchovies.

absolutely delicious and so surprisingly easy to prepare! i did lightly brown the garlic and anchovies in the olive oil, then added the tomatoes and simmered while the pasta was boiling. turned out fantastic and filled the kitchen with the most wonderful aroma.

This is my absolute favorite pasta dish, this recipe is quite close to any I've had in a restaurant. In lieu of fresh tomatoes I use canned chopped ones (Parmalat variety) and instead of the red wine vinegar - I give it a healthy dose of red wine. I call a dish like this a "pantry" meal because when you are totally out of food you can still make a good meal from items regularly stocked in the pantry.

A very quick, easy and tasty weeknight supper. The flavour are substantial enough to stand up to a nice pinot noir. I will definitely make again at when fresh tomatoes are abundant. I added organic kalamalta olives which are a bit less salty.

Don't be scared off by the anchovy - the balance here makes it perfectly anonymous. This really is an extremely tasty, quick and easy showstopper.

A great late summer dish... really brought out the flavor of the tomatoes and the olives. I didn't salt the water, and thought it tasted better (not too salty). I didn't cook the tomatoes ahead of time, but did throw the sauce mixture into the hot pasta pot after I had drained the pasta out. Definitely add a little of the pasta water... seemed quite healthy.

Great side dish. I used canned petite tomatoes and left out the Kalamata olives. I took the advice of others and sauted the garlic and tomatoes before adding. Next time I will add a few more anchovies.

Good recipe. However, mine turned out too salty-- I think next time I would not salt the pasta water, and I'd cut the capers back slightly. Between the olives, the capers and the anchovies, the salt level got really high. Otherwise, an interesting version of an old fave. I also sauteed the garlic and the tomatoes briefly, but added the herbs and the olives directly into the hot pasta.

I make puttanesca sauce from scratch - it only takes about 20 minutes of cooking. And the aroma really works - my husband could smell it cooking all the way to our sidewalk. Didn't make much money off of him though!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish and will definately make it again. It was very quick to prepare. We used whole wheat pasta and it really added something. We did saute the garlic and tomatoes for a couple of minutes and then added everything else just before adding to the hot pasta. The pasta water really seemed to bring it all together. By the way we forgot to add salt and pepper and didn't miss any further salt added. Might add pepper next time. Just delicious for a quick evening meal.

Shut UP, Manhattan, you're killing me. I laughed about this for about 10 minutes. Oh, and the recipe is a keeper.

I heard that prostitutes would cook this spicy sauce near an open window in order to attract business.Potential clients would be attracted by the aroma.

Here's a little interesting note on the name..."puttanesca"...putta is slang Italian for prostitute and it is commonly thought that the recipe refers to how quick and easy the sauce is, enabling the girls to get back to work quickly, after a quick bite. However, I've learned that it also references Italian housewives who "stray"...and that they have a nice big pot of "puttanesca" on the stove when they return home from their...liasons...so they can feed their unsuspecting husbands. Regardless, it's a great recipe and a tradition in many Italian households.

Great! A nice meal for a hot September night, with a perfect garden tomato or two. And, uhhh, NYC - your comment is just a bit too hip for me. Did you like it?

I make this the old fashioned way...by cooking it. Hardly takes 30 minutes. However! This is such a great way to use fresh vegies. Really good! And if the prositutes of yore had figured it out, they would have spent even less time appeasing the male tummy. And more time appeasing them! Now, THAT'S a good thing! :)

A summertime favorite to be sure. I love the fresh veggies and a dish which doesn't require much hot stove time is a plus. You just whip it together in 30 min and it's warm weather heaven.

We liked this dish, too. However, next time I would not use so much olive oil. It just wasn't needed. We added small cubes of tender, fresh mozz to give it some protein. It soaked up the various flavors and was a great addition. Like the others said, have some crusty bread on hand to mop up the yummy tomatoes and juices. P.S. The gathering, washing, and chopping of ingredients took more like one hour to get dinner on the table, not 30 minutes!!

For Puttanesca fans this is a fantastic, uncooked summer version--a delectable dish that makes the most of fresh garden tomatoes in their prime. With this as the entree and a loaf of crispy french bread on hand for dipping into the sauce, you've got a simple and perfect dinner for a hot summer evening.

excellent and easy. i got great ripe tomatoes from local farmers market which just make the whole thing even better! i am also an anchovy lover so i doubled the amount of anchovy plus the olive oil that comes with the anchovies. It also works great as a topping on bread.

A great easy summertime recipee. I used anchovy paste, but that was the only change...for a change!

I was really disappinted with this recipe. It just didn't get it. I let the tomatoes, et al., sit for about an hour to develop flavors, but it was missing something. Maybe all it needed was a little feta or goat cheese sprinkled on top.

My being new in the kitchen may have a lot to do with the fact that this dish, while being good, lacked punch. I think it was a chef problem rather than a recipe issue. Ha Ha! I will have to give it another go. Beautiful served on white though!

Excellent. We added some sauteed zuchini to it (hey, it's that time of year...zuchini is added to EVERYTHING). Didn't feel like the added cooking water was needed, but we also used Roma tomatoes. While waiting for the linguini to cook, we decided that the sauce would be excellent as: a) Bruschetta topping; b) as a major part and dressing for a salad, using strong greens (e.g., arugula, spinach); or c) blend the tomatoes, parsley, basil, oil and vinegar, add the remaining ingredients and chill...add croutons for a wonderful gazpacho. As is, it was great!

This is the picture of simplicity. It is excelent with some fried calamari,fried shrimps,or saute of chicken breast.I have prepared this for a number of guests and never had any leftover. PS: This dish must be prepared and served fresh.It doesn't reheat well.

Easy to prepare, beautiful presentation, and an absolutely delicious taste of summer! I will long for this dish come January! I wouldn't change a thing in this dish. It's perfect!
