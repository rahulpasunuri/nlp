I forgot. I also added some orange zest and Tripple Sec. I'm sure Grand Marnier would work also.

Very good. 3+ forks. I was looking for something quick and easy and this was it. The cinnamon and cloves add a holiday taste. It might not appeal to everyone, but we liked it. Used fresh strawberries and rhubarb. Didn't do the whipped cream and nuts.

We made this for dinner with 4 thimbs up. Try using fresh lemon water as the liquid, and a splah of Gran Mariner.
