If indeed it is true that fat is necessary to activate the spices in curry powder, why not just add a small amount of oil to the frying pan after toasting the spices? Haven't tried the recipe, though, I just a westerner who has learned IndoPak cooking from natives....

I'm with the Albertan - this recipe has been a success with my BBQ guests (and me) the last three years. Yes, I up the curry and cumin significantly, add a little salt and replace the nonfat dairy with lowfat. But I've never had a problem with gloppiness (I start with chopped, not whole spinach, which may help). The choice and freshness of curry may also make a difference. Frankly, I'm tempted to give it four forks just to up the average, but I really do think it's "Delicious."

I read the reviews, and so didn't use non-fat yogurt, and I did use creme fraiche, which one would think would improve the taste. Nope. This was bland, fairly unattractive, and NOT popular at the party. Don't waste your time--store bought dip is better than this.

Use yogurt or sour cream with some fat content as some of the spices in the curry powder are only fully activated by the presence of a fat!

I'm glad I didn't read the review of this recipe before I made it because it was a big hit with my guests! I used fresh spinach, added some mayo and some fresh parmesan (it was bland initially). It's a nice light dip - great with stone wheat thins.

I made this dip for a party, and it turned out looking like green sludge. If I did make it again, I would not puree the spinach. Also, I added a lot more spices - it didn't have a lot of flavor. I wasn't too excited about it.

I had to tweek it for our taste buds and it was delicious once that happened. The 3/4 cup of yogurt makes it too sour. So, I added 1/4 tsp of salt to counteract the sourness. The 1 tsp of curry powder didn't bring the curry flavor out enough -- I doubled that. I had to stop my husband from eating the whole thing! Next time I make it, I'm using 1/2 cup yogurt, however.

Overall, I thought that this dip was pretty bland. After tasting it, I wish I had made the traditional spinach dip with Knorr's vegetable soup mix. In fact, if I had any on hand, I would have started over!
