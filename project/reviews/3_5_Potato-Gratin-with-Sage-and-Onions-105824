Fabulous, with no need for a trip to the store! I only had red potatoes and I didn't have the fresh ingredients on hand, so I instead of fresh sage, garlic and onions, I used dried sage (1 TB) and shallots. The results were amazing. next time, I'm doing the same thing, but mashing them at the end for a twist. My friends raved about this dish.

I first tried this recipe as written with fantastic results. Last year I substituted sweet potatoes for the Yukons and it was a delicious, sweet addition to our Thanksgiving table.

I was very pleasantly surprised at this gratin. Simple ingredients yielded delicious results. Fresh sage adds that extra touch.

I used light cream and added Gruyere cheese and it is now a family favorite. Even cooked in my trusty old cast iron skillet I will not hesitate to serve this at a dinner party. The beautiful golden brown crust and rich flavor more than make up for the "rustic" presentation.

This dish was terrific! My only concern: while it tastes delicious, it doesn't look very attractive. It had a drabby gray color to it but not bad enough to stop me from making it again.

Awesome! Didn't have an oven-proof skillet available, so I did transfer from skillet to a baking dish for the oven phase. Baked for about 70 minutes to absorb/reduce the full amount of cream. Added just a light shredding of fontina to the top for about the last 5 minutes, just enough to bubble and start to brown. Great sage flavor (3 tsp dried rubbed sage vs the fresh), lots of left overs -- served with a plain london broil and a side of peas.

Wow! Fantastic little bit different potato dish. I think next time I will use chicken stock and regular milk, with the starch from the potato, I'm sure it will be creamy and delicious. Also, I found that my fresh from the garden sage was a little mild. Could it be because it' very new? Old plant, just new because of the time of year. Anyone know?

A great and not-too-difficult side dish. The only change I will make next time is to use white or yellow onions rather than the red ones. The red ones have a little more sugar in them and resulted in a slightly sweet dish. Also, some blue cheese crumbles on top were a nice touch.

Good easy gratin, but why use water when you can use chicken broth to intensify the flavor? I also subbed sour cream and whole milk for the cream I did not have and it turned out fab. Sprinkle parm at the table. Yummers.

I found this dish to be dull and lifeless with a serious lack of flavor or richness. I was looking forward to it from the rave reviews, however, I was truly disappointed.

I love this recipe! It was my first (and second) attempt at gratin and I found out to be rich and creamy with a great subtle flavor. And still wonderful the next day. The perfect side dish.

This recipe is great. I would definately make it again. I've made it twice so far. The second time I added more onions and more sage for more of a kick. A keeper.

This is such a simple, yet incredibly delicous dish. There is plenty of flavor, but not so much that it would overpower any main course. Perfect consistency...definitely no cheese needed...decadent just exactly as prepared

Delicious. Perfect on a cool fall day. The sage gives the dish a great flavour that is just right- not overpowering.

Yum! I made this last night, following the recipe pretty much to a T, except I used sage that wasa dried from my garden. Very simple to prepare- I made mine in myu cast iron skillet, and I did make sure to rotate the potatoes while cooking to evenly distribute heat and the ingredients. It is also amazing the next day. No need to add cheese (and I am a cheese-lover). It is rich and decadent on it's own.

The onions were wonderfully carmelized and sweet. The potatoes baked in cream were heavenly, however the sage didn't come through at all! Am puzzled as to why since I used "just picked" from my garden, and the amounts were not small. Could be the variety of sage isn't as pungent. A note to future cooks: Please try this recipe as is w/o cheese. You will be surprised as I was just how good it is. Loved the ease in preparation also.

Great recipe! I used what I had at home - dried sage instead of fresh and half evaporated milk, half skim milk instead of cream. I sliced the potato very thin using a mandoline so I only had it in the oven for 25 minutes. I also cooked it in a cast iron skillet so it was easy to saute, boil and put in oven.

To whom ever is going and make this recipe...U DO NOT NEED CHEESE!! It is creamy and wonderful all on it's "whipping" cream own...this has sage ..butter...onions and cream..what else can u ask for..certinly not cheese..trust me...try this and u will NOT be dissapointed ...u dont need cheese..it's good..very good ..on it's own...and very easy..I used my cuisinart (sp?) to slice the potatoes( special attachment) .very easy and quick...you have to try this instead of just mashed!!! PS: I used russet's only because I didnt have yukon (which I LOVE) but this was absolutly wonderful in spite of that..so russets work JUST as well!!

We liked this dish, but it would certainly be improved with the addition of cheese. Actually, I thought "gratin" meant "topped with cheese and baked" but I guess that is open for interpretation since there isn't a shred of cheese in the original recipe. When I make it again, instead of the other reviewers recommended Gruyere, I will use something milder, like Fontina. I think the slightly nutty flavor would compliment the almost sweet onions and sage better than Gruyere.

Loved this dish! Easy to make and delicious.

I definitly would add cheese as I did. I used half and half instead of straight cream. I added gruyere cheese because of previous comments and worked well.

I also thought this dish was scrumptious - creamy and very flavorful. Definitely use Yukon Golds, their buttery taste lends another level to the dish. I also sprinkled grated Gruyere in the middle and on top...it was a nice addition. I will make this again and again.

This dish melts in your mouth. It was so easy to make, I would make it again in a heartbeat. Perfect for company, a great comfort food!

Very easy. These are basic potatoes, nothing fancy, but they are good and filling. I prefer mine with cheese, I think, and will probably add some cheese next time.

This was very easy to prepare and a big hit when we served it at a family gathering. When we made it a second time, we added freshly grated nutmeg along with a little more salt and pepper. Half way through the baking time, we pulled the pan out and sprinkled the potato mixture with shredded Gruyere. It was delicious!

I made this dish along with traditional mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner. I have plenty of mashed potatoes left over but these were gone. I will definately make this one again.
