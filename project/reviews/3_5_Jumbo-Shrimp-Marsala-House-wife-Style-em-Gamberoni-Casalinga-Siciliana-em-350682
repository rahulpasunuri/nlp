Made this dish for Christmas eve dinner. Family loved it. I modified the recipe adding 1/2 Tbls hot red pepper flakes, omitted capers, 2 dry bay leaves, and used a can of peeled, plum tomatoes with sauce. I simmered the dish for 20 mins until reduced. It was spicy, flavorful and would work well over pasta if you have a vegetarian in the family that doesn't eat shrimp.

A disappointing waste of prawns. Even though I tried to boost the flavour of the sauce with a few chillies and a bit more garlic, it was far too bland. I did substitute sherry for the marsala.

How many does this serve? I cut recipe in half. Followed it pretty much to the letter.

This was a bit "different" for the palates at our dinner table. As we sat there eating it, the flavors were all swirling in our mouthes, and the comments were "interesting" different" refreshing".. I think my husband put in too much fennel seed, so be careful with that..it can be powerful! Overall, I am not sure we'd make this again, but it is something different to try when you are looking for something different to do with shrimp! Also, it was very easy to prepare.

This was easy, quick, tasy, and attractive to serve. I cooked all but the shrimp to transport for Christmas dinner...just put in a lidded stove-top dish with the uncooked shrimp on top, and finished it off on the stovetop. Interesing mix of ingredients...I followed the recipe to the letter.

Super easy and tasty. Personally I like shrimp with more flavor... garlic, cayenne, etc. My husband suprisingly loved it and wants it on the regular menu

So interesting and easy. Ended up serving with basmati (limited pantry), really tasty.

This was so quick to make. I thought I had marsala but was out so i used white wine. It was yummy. The currants really added a nice sweetness. It tasted better the next day.

This was delicious. I cooked it for Christmas dinner and it got rave reviews. I followed the recipe to the letter, except I omitted the currants.
