I added 2 T of sour cream to mellow out the flavor and 1 tsp of salt. This made the dressing more to my liking. I served it with a spinach salad with blue cheese crumbles on top.

I'm usually wary if the existing reviews aren't stellar, but I made this anyway and thought it was outstanding exactly as written. To me, this is precisely what blue cheese salad dressing should taste like. Granted, it is a bit thin  and I even used full-fat buttermilk. Others said it wasn't cheesy enough but I thought it was, and I live for cheese  however just for extra thickness I may add more cheese next time. It was very easy cleanup to put all the ingredients in a glass measuring cup and use a hand blender to combine. I doubled it and am glad I did because I wanted to have it on hand all week.

This was OK and easy. Kind of muddied flavors.

This was really tasty, and it couldn't be easier to make. I wanted more cheese and since I'd used up the rest of the blue, I added crumbled feta. Worked beautifully.

this calls for way too much mustard, i dumped most of the dressing out and added more buttermilk to get the flavor of mustard toned down.

Great flavor. Tha mustard and blue cheese go great together. I probably used more blue cheese than called for to used up what I had. The only thing was that the dressing was a little thin. Next time I would blend in some olive oil or maybe sour cream to give it more body.

Just made this today. If you like a strong cheese flavor you really have to add quite a bit more.I felt it needed a little extra of everything. I omitted the worcestershire because I don't care for it. Had a dollop of sour cream in the fridge so I added that too. Also, not necessary to bother with a blender...I justed whisked it all together. Less clean up. Even with the little tweaking this is a fast, easy keeper.

Wonderful, very easy to make and a great use of leftover buttermilk!

I tried this dressing without Wostershire sauce (didn't have any) and took the suggestion of adding more cheese...I think I used 2 ounces. It was perfectly delicious this way.

Quite good, however, depending on the blue cheese you are using and how strong you like your dressing to taste, you might want to substantially increase the amount of cheese
