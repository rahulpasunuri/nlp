A nice, easy, recipe. Instead of pumpkin pie spice I used fresh ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. We all liked it, but I have to admit that it reminded me enough of falafel to make me wonder if it was worth the price of lamb.

Yes, highly delighted to find such a well thought out, but simple recipe. We cooked lamb that my aunt raised a bit north of town, and all around, everything came out delicious!

Delicious! I would recommend using a mix of fresh spices instead of pumpkin pie spice. We used fresh ginger as part of the "pumpkin pie spice" and that worked out well. I think a few more fillings in the pita could also be good. Chopped cucumber, perhaps?

I used ground turkey and spiced it with cumin, salt, cayenne pepper, green onion and a little fresh mint. The burgers turned out really well on a Krups electric panini press. Plain yogurt still makes a pretty good sauce, although I'd like to try using a true Greek yogurt next time.

My husband is on a very restrictive low cholesterol diet. I make these with ultra lean ground turkey accompanied by the sauce made with non fat yogurt. They are truly one of our favorite quick fixes! They also taste great with a good cabernet, which is also heart healthy!

The basic burger itself is ideal here. Stray from the pita, yogurt, and tomato as the topping and play the other options. The burger itself is a wonderful mixture of sweet and spicy. Add this to the natural spicy flavor of good ground lamb and the options or limitless. One of my favorite was merely topping the lamb burger with a little grated asiago and putting it between a whole wheat bun with a sweet paprika mayo. NICE!

Very tasty - as for nationality - Turkish, Greek, Arab, Armenian and all other middle eastern recipes have mixed and matched over the centuries. This recipe could be from any area in the region.

Very good recipe although I don't understand why people get so worked up over a recipe. Can't we all just get along ?

This is not the place for fanatic racists!!If everybody loved these, what's the problem. Easy, different, healthy, quick and delicious. It's global world. Go find some place else for discrimination!!

Absolutely f a b u l o u s! Not to offend the cook from ca who wishes to be "country specific" I went for Mediterranean fusion with this and subbed store bought tzatziki for the yoghurt sauce, tossed in some crumbled feta and garnished with arugula.... the spice mixture is divine with the lamb!

These burgers were awesome! Although as a general rule, it's hard to duplicate the taste of the consistently fresh and original food in Turkey, you guys come pretty close. All my guests were asking for the recipe, and not a scrap was left by the time they left.

I first made this recipe for my family, and it was such a hit that I made it for a party of 17 -- once again it got RAVES! The children thought the burgers a bit spicy (you can reduce the cayenne for them), but the grownups licked their plates. My only modifications were to use red onion instead of scallions, and, since I didn't have prepared pumpkin pie spice, to make my own from ground ginger, nutmeg, cloves & mace. Definitely a WINNER recipe! Perfect for summer entertaining, especially when paired with tomatoes from our garden!

We were very disappointed with this recipe. The burgers were blah and the sauce wasn't enough to rescue the recipe. We will not make these again. Stick with other Bon Appetit turkey burger recipes. We have been pleased with many of them.
