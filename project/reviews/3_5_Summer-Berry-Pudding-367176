The berry mix is lovely. Served it along with pound cake.

One of my absolute favorite recipes to make for a birthday or event - it's about as healthy a dessert as you will find and it Never fails to impress! People see the color and the delicious juicy flavor and always love it. Great for kids too!

Amazing. I've made it twice, the first time I used the spring form pan the second time I used ramekins. The ramekins were perfect and made the dish much less messy. The flavors also came together much quicker. I topped the dessert with homemade grand marnier whipped cream. Even my husband who doesn't like sweets loved it!

I actually made this without the blackberries, butter, cut the fruit to about half for each and used 1/4 cup of confectioner's sugar and it not only came out delicious and satisfying but with about half the calories per serving. Although my version added up to 11 servings(We take slightly smaller slices in my family). So now I can add the dollop of whipped, or any cream for that matter without going way into the 400 calorie range. Hurrah!

Incredibly easy and good! Added a bit of read wine to the berry sauce, and shrunk ratios considerably for two servings. I layered my pudding in teacups and served it warm with custard sauce and whipped cream. Fantastic! It was nice to have a little of the berry sauce reserved to pour over our pudding as we ate. I also used a mixture of challah and brioche bread for my layers. I preferred the density of the challah.

This dessert came out extremely tasty, and it was fairly easy to make (although I made my own Brioche, using the Golden Brioche recipe from this site). I did use the extra butter, as called for in the recipe, with the cinnamon sugar. It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious! My only complaint was that I think the measurements for the berries are off. 2 pints each of 4 kinds of berries adds up to 16 cups (a pint of berries is about 2 cups), which was way too much berry sauce for one pan. I ended up making it in a trifle dish (which was slightly larger than my 9-inch springform) and only used about half of the berries. I would definitely make this again, but with only 1 pint each!

I make this in individual ramekins, cutting the bread rounds to fit. A lovely presentation with a dollop of whipped cream or creme fraiche. Agree that butter is not needed. I usually use a potato bread, which has a slightly firmer texture.

Summer pudding is one of my favorite. Butter is not necessary and not as much sugar.

Ever since we lived in England, I've made a summer pudding. I use a proper pudding basin, line it with bread (any solid white type),no plastic, and use whatever berries are in season, but ALWAYS currants. They are the key. Not nearly so much sugar - only a spoonful or so, depending on the berries. Creme fraiche is good with it,if you don't have real English cream!

An amazing dessert! Any good white bread will work and any combination of berries as well. Like the other reviewer, I had extra sauce and also used with the pudding. This is my favorite Summer Dessert!!

I can't comment on the recipe, but I can give you my opinion of the final product. I was lucky enough to dine at a friends house who made this pudding - DELICIOUS! And beautiful to look at. Went searching for the recipe so that I could try it for my family.

I made this for a dinner party and it was fabulous! I made it the night before and used 1/2 honey and 1/2 agave syrup instead of the 1 cup of sugar. I used a 9 inch pan and had about 1 cup of berry sauce leftover, after I squished and poked etc to try to use it all, so I saved that, added a squeeze of lemon, a few fresh berries and served it over the top. It made it look really pretty. It was great to have a no bake dessert in this heat. I served it with a dollop of plain thick yogurt on top. It tasted nice and fresh. A nice way to showcase all of the fresh local berries.
