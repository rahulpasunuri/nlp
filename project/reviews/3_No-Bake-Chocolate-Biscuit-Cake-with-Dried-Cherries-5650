my family was very pleased with this recipe. i am trying recipes for the holidays and thought this was fruity, chocolaty and nutty enough for a party. it is delicious, but is so rich it should be served in small bite sizes, so double the servings. used dried cranberries instead of the raisins..quite good! will experiment with orange peel and currants next time! very, very easy to prepare. i used hershey's dark chocolate bits...my favorite type of chocolate. the recipe lends itself to experimentation. think chocolate fruitcake. yum, yum.

Marie biscuits would come close to these biscuits.Something sweet and buttery but not shortbread!

I would like to try this recipe, but I am not familiar with the bisquits listed in the ingredients. Where can I find the bisquits?

My family and friends loved this, great dessert for hot day. Very unusual, not a cake or candy or cookie or fudge exactly, something in between. Keep cold. Yes, it does crumble, but so delicious. I used mild molasses, which gave a nice overtone. My husband rarely eats desserts but raved about this and asked me to make again for his birthday.

This came out hard and difficult to slice. I was rich but a bit too chunky and hard overall.
