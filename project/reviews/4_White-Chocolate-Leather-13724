This is so very easy to use as a substitute for fondant in cake decorating. I like it much better because of the flavor. I used it on a dark chocolate cake and formed it into waves around the top of the cake. I accented it with silver dragees held in place by tiny dabs of buttercream. It was beautifula nd tasty.
