Quite good! I made a half-batch and served it with some crusty bread for a healthy one-dish meal. The haddock flaked up beautifully and the charmoula sauce was delicious and intensely flavorful.

My guests LOVE this recipe. I cut salt to 1/2t (and did not salt every layer) and oil to 1/4 c. Used cod and did not pre-cook the peppers. It was spicy and delicious. This and a loaf of bread is a great one dish meal. Very festive and my new favorite way to cook fish.

I referred to cumin added in error in my earlier review. I didn't mean this. I used the recommended amount of cumin but added a 1/2 tsp coriander as well. It was fine.

I have made this a couple of times now. Both times it was very good. The second time I did not have cilantro. I added a 1/2 tsp of cumin in error and it still was very flavourful. I found pouring the oil into the sauce ingredients not necessary. We use a small hand held chopper and this just requires too much co-ordination :) I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes fish and piquant flavour. (we used haddock).

Very good, but not great. I made some minor alterations, largely based on others' reviews. I used 1/2 tsp of salt, which was plenty, and only 1/4 cup of olive oil. The cooking time is too long for the fish, but not long enough for the tomato. Because I made the fully amount of sauce, but half the fish, there was plenty of sauce left over. Tonight I made a poached salmon, threw a little fresh rosemary in the cooking liquid and topped the salmon with the charmoula sauce. THAT was excellent. Use the sauce for other recipes, it's great.

Delicious! I've made it three times and it's a hit every time! We don't have haddock in So Cal so I used tilapia or red snapper. Tonight I sauteed a sliced red onion with the peppers and that was a great addition!

Lovely dish. I followed the recipe pretty closely, only adjusting as previous reviewers had suggested. Cut the salt in the sauce to 1 tsp, had 1 tsp sweet paprika and 1 tsp of smoked paprika. Drizzled some sauce over the peppers & potatoes before layering the fish and then the tomatoes on top, with rest of sauce over all. Beautiful, not hard, delicious, very healthy, unusual.

Excellent recipe. I ended up making it twice in the same month - it was that much of a hit. Even my husband, who is not a fish fan, went back for seconds and thirds. I added slightly less salt as per previous reviews, and served with crusty bread and nice bottle of wine. Phenomenal. Next time, I'll double or triple the sauce to have on hand for other meats. Delicious.

Served this to two guests who do not care for Haddock and they went back for a second helping. I made the recipe as written except placed the tomatoes on top of the fish which made a nicer presentation.

Incredibly tasty and a great recipe for company when you don't want to be tied up in the kitchen when the guests arrive. Just get it all assembled, then pop it in the oven for the baking. Since fresh tomatoes aren't great this time of year, I used canned diced tomatoes (good ones, like Muir Glen) instead and it came out great. Made a quinoa salad to go with it. Served with a crusty baguette, perfect for enjoying the sauce. We're making the recipe for a second time this week - it's that good!

Living in the "land of the Haddock" always looking for new ways to utilize this fish. Prepared as directed but took advice to decrease the salt by one tsp. Everyone enjoyed the dish and will make again. You can easily increase/decrease the veggies as you have on hand.

Easy to prepare and I am happy to have another way to prepare a fish entree. Both my husband and I enjoyed it very much. It stood on its own since it had potatoes and vegetables but next time I will serve with rice and fresh guacamole.

I wanted to make this recipe in the worst way because it sounded good, but I used some major substitutions and it still was awesome! I used sweet onions sliced thin and a layer of fresh spinach in place of the peppers and tomatoes. I used chicken, vegetable couscous instead of the potatoes and for the charmoula sauce I used fresh spinach instead of parsley and cilantro. Also I did not have cumin. The fish was flavorful,nice and lemony and garlicky with bit of a bite from the cayenne very delicious!

The family adored it and it is so adaptable. We didn't have potatoes, so I substituted sliced eggplant and onions. The sauce would be good on so many things.

This charmoula sauce was very easy and delicious. The fish was very tender so altogether a recipe I would use again. I used this sauce with lamb chops the next day and was equally great. I 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika and 1 sweet. It added an extra depth. The bite of cayenne is a must.

Yuck! this was nasty. I threw out the leftovers. Enough said.

I pan fried the potatoe slices until brown. Used 1 dup of cilantro and no parsley. Broccoli instead of peppers, and because I ran out, substituted 1.5 tsps cumin with .5 tsp tmeric and .5 tsp curry. I feel the salt needs to be halfed or even 1/3 what it calls for. Also, I make the this recipe in 1/3 (one pound of fish) but use the whole amount of sauce for that. Great recipe, maybe I will try it to spec :)

i also significantly reduced the amount of salt used. I put a sprinkle of salt on the potatoes after i layered them and that was it. Came out perfectly

This dish is quite tasty and very easy to make. Everyone enjoyed it and i will definately make this dish again. I did however make some changes. Instead of two green peppers i used only one which was plenty. I also decided to add a little bit of grated mozzarella cheese after the layer of potatoes and a bit more after the layer of tomatoes. This was a great addition to the recipe. I also decided to bread the fish using a beaten egg which i dipped the fish in and covered it in bread crumbs. I found that this added a great texture to fish. I poured the sauce on the breaded fish and baked it for 25 minutes. I look forward to making this recipe again!

This recipe takes a bit longer than the ones I usually make but it is absolutely worth the effort. The flavor is amazing. There are only two of us so we ate half the day I cooked it and ate the the other half a few days later. It was even better the second time. Definitely a keeper!!

Rating: 4
This recipe is more filling and satisfying than most fish dishes. Because we were cooking for only three (rather than six), we used only 1 1/2 lbs haddock, 1 tomato, 1 bell pepper and half the sauce. We used the whole pound (two large) red potatoes. It was perfect for me, but my husband says next time he'd like to make the whole sauce amount. Really satisfying!

Rating: 4
This was really really good. The only changes I made was that I included a jalapeno pepper (chopped) into the pepper phase, as my husband and I love a little more spice.. and since we are trying to get rid of excess carbs, we used butternut squash instead of potatoes.. which gave a sweet vs spicy contrast to the dish and worked really well!

I was a little surprised that there were no onions in this recipe, but I did not ad them. It was delicious. My husband loved it and says it's a keeper. The sauce smelled delicious. The flavors blended very well and it's a nice change from fried haddock.

Delicious and so easy. Made this many times a few years ago and then forgot about it. This time I used green beans that I had defrosted instead of the green/red pepper -- defrosted them fully and then added (didn't sautee first). Only used 1 tsp of salt, which was plenty. Don't forget to buy haddock caught with a hook and line; trawled haddock is bad news!

We were at friends for dinner and this is the dish they served. I LOVED it! For someone who never has two helping of anything, I had not only a second helping, but a little wee bit more. My 6 yr old enjoyed it also. My friend made 2 9x13 dishes ... saving one for dinner the next day. She said it even tasted better reheated the next day. Time for flavours to meld even more. Definately a one a month recipe for me!

This recipe is excellent. The flavors are bright and almost savory at the same time. I used a little bit less salt as some others did. I will add this to my regular rotation.

This dish is so flavorful and healthy...it will become a regular at our house. As usual, I had to tweak it because I didn't have everything on hand but it was very close. I diced the potatoes and layered them in a pyrex with TJ's roasted red pepper sauce, topped with chopped onion and tomatoes. Olive oil, s+p and then roasted for about 25 minutes. I made the charmoula with lime juice. I placed the seasoned fish on top of the potato mix and then the charmoula and roasted for another 25 or so. I served it over brown rice and a chopped green salad and it was like lovely restaurant food. I impressed myself!

Hands down, one of the best epicurious recipes I've found. I've made it a few times now, and have fiddled with the salt and the spice. I like it w/ a tad less salt, and a little more heat. I also add carrots into the vegetable mix.

This was amazing! I did cut the amount of salt in half to 1 tsp. as others recommended. We sliced the potatoes very thing using a mandolin and instead of roasting them, I just put everything on top of them as written and it all cooked just fine. We cooked the fish for 25 minutes and it was just perfect. We'll be making this one again and again...can't believe the flavors!

I make this regularly and love it but agree with the salt comment. I also have skipped some of the prep steps without adverse effect (e.g. didn't saute the peppers and have even barely cooked the potatoes). Great midweek recipe good enough for company. Tonight, I'm going to cut back on some of the oil and replace it with stock to make it a bit healthier,

It's refreshing to find a recipe for fish with an interesting blend of spicy flavors. This dish has some flair in taste and color! I do agree with another reviewer that the amount of salt in the sauce can be decreased. I used 1-1/2 tsp. and I suspect 1 tsp. salt would be plenty. (Thanks to tracismith for the tip about adjusting the salt level!)

Didn't have all the ingredients for step one, but I made the sauce, put it on some ling cod and baked it as instructed. It rocks! 3 hours later my brain is telling me to go have some of the leftovers. I threw in some sliced carrots, yellow onions and zucchini. They stewed with the fish very nicely. For sides I cooked black beans and white rice, and spooned the sauce over it. Would definitely make this again.

I omitted the potatoes (we eat low-carb) & placed the fish on a bed of halved grape tomatoes. Other than that, I made the remainder of this recipe as written & it was EZ & delicious! Since I love haddock, I jumped at the chance to use it in a recipe. I will definitely make this again and as many other cooks have noted, I will try the sauce on other meats. I think it would work nicely as a marinade for chicken breasts. YUM!

This is fabulous! My husband hasn't stopped talking about and dinner has been over for an hour. Both of my kids (grade school ages) gobbled it as well. Will definitely be a staple in my house. Probably will try the sauce on other things as well. I put the onions and peppers in raw and loved the "roasted" effect in the sauce. I didn't have potatoes, so simply omitted that step and served it over fettucine. Can't say enough about how delicious, simple and attractive it was.

Delicious! I prepared the meal on a bed of 2 cans (drained) cannelini beans, 1 chopped garlic clove, and 2 T. olive oil instead of the potatoes and served it with rice. I used 1 1/2 pounds of cod for 4 people and had leftovers for lunch. Yum!

This was incredibly good and the various ingredients make for a colorful presentation on the plate. The charmoula sauce complements the fish well. I omitted the potatoes (lower carb), sauteed a sliced onion with the peppers and doubled the garlic in the sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee.

This is some good eats! I sliced the potatoes thin, brushed with olive oil, and layered them on the bottom of my large casserole - about an inch thick. I baked this for 20 minutes before adding the rest. Also, I substituted roasted garlic, all nutty and sweet, for the 5 cloves the sauce calls for. Really, very good.

Fantastic flavors. We used turbot in place of the haddock -- any mild white fish should work. The sauce is packed with flavor, but not overpowering. Will definitely try this again, and with different types of fish.

I had to change a few things on the fly- I had the wrong kind of potatoes, and winter tomatoes are horrid so I substituted canned. It was still really good! My kids thought it had too much cumin but the adults loved it. Will definitely make again.

I found the sauce too overpowering for the fish. I like to taste whatever fish we are serving, but tried this recipe because I liked the sound of layering all the different ingredients, all of which my husband and I like. Won't make this again, but feel the use of this recipe with chicken might be worth a try.

WOW! So simple to make, but so tasty! I couldn't stop sneaking bits from the pan after. Modifications: I roasted the peppers along with the potatoes. I love roasted peppers with salt and pepper. I used Ancho Chile instead of cayenne. I'd use a little less lemon next time. Went super well with roasted asparagus (salt and pepper)!

I've made this dish several times, always to rave reviews. I love the pungent sauce and I think it goes well with fish, as well as the vegetables. I've added onions to the bell peppers, too, for a change.

Eh? The Charmoula sauce is delicious, I'll definitely make that again (I think the key is to have good quality and FRESH dried paprika and cumin -- can't beat Penzeys-- for those who found it bitter), but I didn't think the elements of the dish (fish, vegetables, potatoes) came together at all. I used fresh hake (close relative of cod) red bell pepper and yukon gold potatoes (what I had in the kitchen), but I don't think that's the problem. The fresh tomatoes took to the sauce and were delicious. I might do again with fish and sauce on a bed of tomatoes, but will more likely use the sauce on grilled lamb, chicken, or salmon.

I had never cooked haddock before, and this was a really interesting dish. You could do a lot with the vegetables it's cooked with. I used sweet potatoes instead of white and it was great. You could add mushrooms, celery, fennel--you name it. All you need to finish off the meal is a nice salad and maybe some crispy bread.

YUM! I don't like haddock, so I replaced it with halibut (I think tuna or swordfish would work too). I also decreased the cilantro in the sauce and increased the parsley and added lemon zest!

Pretty awful. Can't understand why my husband and I did not like this dish - we love all the ingredients and I followed the recipe exactly. I am practically addicted to cilantro, but it completely overpowered any other flavor. In my opinion the end result was an extremely bitter tasting fish dish and barely edible.
