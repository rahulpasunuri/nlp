I doubled the recipe, using 2 cloves of garlic and 2% Greek yogurt. It was wonderful with the Bulgur stuffed tomatoes!

Loved it! I made it for souvlaki but had pleny left over so used it as a dressing in salad and steak sandwich and as a main dressing for a cheese, egg and salad mix that I have for a work lunch. A friend had warned me to drain the yoghurt through cheesecloth (I used a tea towel) to eliminate the water. Didn't bother to drain the cucumber but only used one instead of two. It was lovely and thick.

This is SO good! It only takes 5-10 minutes to prepare, and it's really flavorful. I will be serving it as an accompaniment to turkish style zucchini pancakes. Definitely use a thicker yogurt. A strong Greek yogurt works well.

This sauce was quick, easy, and DELICIOUS! I made it as an accompaniment to Greek shish kabob. It was easier than the traditional Greek yogurt-sauce, but just as tasty. Half of my dinner party demanded the recipe before they went home!

Good stuff! I adore garlic so I use it with everything: fish, veggies, desserts (haha). To avoid the possibility of curdling I left out the lemon juice and instead served sumac, which has a nice subtle sourness, to sprinkle on top. I used whole-milk Greek yoghurt which is thicker and generally much more flavourful than the regular commercial stuff. Excellent.

I actually made this with the Moroccan spiced beef medallions on this site-as a dipping sauce and it was great.

i tweeked this a bit by adding fresh mint and a bit of agave for a hint of sweetness. tasted great on salmon cakes as a change to tartar sauce. will use this one again!

Tzatziki isn't necessarily better, just different. I've been to Turkey and many Turkish restaurants, and they often serve a yogurt garlic sauce like this. I hope this one tastes like the ones I've had in restaurants.

There is actually a better version of this - known as tzatziki ( greek) and tzatzik ( turkish). Add some fresh dill and a grated cucumber ( squeeze out liquid) and olive oil. Also, essential to use full fat yoghurt. Try the ethnic stores since most american yoghurts are poor cousins of the stuff you get in the middle east

Easy, basic and delicious on pita sandwhiches, beans, salads, eggplant, anything. I use four to five large garlic cloves, a seeded cucumber, a dash of kosher salt and a smidgen of pepper. I process it smooth and keep it in the refrigerator all week. I find that the yogurt has enough tang to allow omission of the lemon.
