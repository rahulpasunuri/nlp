I did not make this either, but I find it odd that a magazine and website for culinary arts would use the recipe directly off of the bag of beans. This recipe is found on "culinary success" brand beans. I came here to find an alternative to soup since it is summer. If I were to make soup, like the others I would omit the bullion because the miso is salty. Yes, saute some veggies. I am not trying to insult anyone, but if you alter the recipe drastically (added kale, sauteed veggies)please don't give it three forks.

I meant tamari soy sauce (in previous review)

I confess I didn't make this soup, but gave it 3 forks for benefit of doubt. From experience: miso soup is traditionally made with seaweed stock - you can add a piece of dried kombu to get the flavoring. Bouillon isn't traditional, but I like it. This seems more like a western version of a miso stew than real miso soup. Aduki beans are awesome on their own. We serve them everything Thanksgiving! and only add tamari soy cause for seasoning.

I cooked dry beans (1 cup dry), and as others have suggested, omitted the bouillon cubes. Also sauteed a small onion and some kale with the carrots. Used hatcho miso, as that's what I had on hand. Delicious! The whole family loved it. I will make this one again.

I was looking for a recipe with Adzuki beans and only had the miso on hand, but sauteed red pepper and purple onions in the oil (plus a little sesame oil) before adding them to the beans, then added kale in time for it to steam before serving. It came out great and is beautiful to boot. I agree that the vegetable bouillon seems unnecessary, as miso alone is packed with flavor.

Oh a delightful diddy from the far east. Love that miso, it's salty but hey it's also very tasty and it makes you drink more water. I'm supossed to be drinking more water as my doctor says it cleans the body. Overall I give it a 12!

Why the veg cubes. This adds to much sodium .Miso by itself is wonderful. For a more veg flavor who not saute some vegetables.

This soup was very yummy and exceeded my expectations after reading the reviews below. Instead of boullion and water, I used a 1 quart box of Imagine No-Chicken Broth. Next time I make this, I think I'll add the shitake mushrooms recommended below. When I cooked the carrots, they stayed firm but glazed a little in the pan, making them very sweet and delicious. My sons (ages 1 & 3) both loved the soup (except for the scallions which I readily ate).

This is worth a special trip to an oriental market to get the beans ( may be designated azuki) and the miso, but do get white miso. The red miso will make the soup too salty.

This soup was too salty. The boullion in addition to the miso was too much. Also, the beans are sort of icky for a light broth such as this. I much prefer a plain miso soup, perhaps with some rice noodles. The carrots were a nice addition, though.

Easy, delicious, nutritious. I love adzuki beans and am grateful for recipes that use them.

A delicious soup that is a breeze to prepare. I made a few changes the second time and liked it even more. I made a vegetable stock from scratch and added 1 Tbs low sodium chicken bouillon, then I added 1/4 pound sliced shiitake mushrooms which were stir fried with the carrots. A few drops of tamari added in each bowl with the scallions was a nice finishing touch. This soup has become a regular dish in our home.

This recipe is easy to make and almost identical to the soup served in japanese restaurants. You can also omit the beans if you like.
