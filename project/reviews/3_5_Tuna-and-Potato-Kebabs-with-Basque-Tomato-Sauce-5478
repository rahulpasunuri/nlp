Tastes good and simple to make. I made this for a client of mine and they didn't leave a drop! I used a gas grill instead of the hickory chips for convenience and it was still very good. (Be careful not to over cook the ahi!) I'd like to make this again with the hickory as I can imagine the flavor would be significantly different.
