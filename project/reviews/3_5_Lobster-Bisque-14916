good recipe, nice flavor. I suggest eating the lobster first then using the shells to make a stock. We had a 6lber that we had boiled and ate as is, then I saved all the shells and tossed on a pot of water (enough to cover) then cooked up a stock. I used several of the ingredients found on this recipe to make the bisque. Came out delicious!

I was not a flavorful as expected. I wanted it to knock me off my socks, like the other lobster bisques I've had. All that time, energy, and $$ spent. PASS!!

I made this for Thanksgiving. Absolutely fabulous and worth the effort. My youngest son finished every bite and asked for more. I used 3 lobsters for soup for 10 and everyone loved the generous chunks that I put in the bowl before I poured the hot bisque over. This is a keeper for special occasions.

Outrageous. I swapped out the sherry with half and half port/madeira. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Best soup I've ever made.

great! i cooked lobsters for only 5 minutes, and they were fine. i anticipated they would cook in the broth, and they did. the broth is fantastic!!! a little goes a long way.

Easily the best soup I have ever tasted. A little goes a long way. Try it with champagne!

The only thing that keeps this from getting 4 forks is the fact that I have had lobster bisque from Cape Cod and Gloster Ma. Other then that this is one of the best I have come across. As am amature chef the time prep is what makes this dish. The only thing I changed was that I added very small cooked potatoe squares. Yes this it then a chowder but it cuts down on the corn starch which tends to make sauces have a high shine and look fake. Also the potatoes give your guests a little something more to eat so the serving of 4 can be streched to 5 or 6 if needed. Also rather then mixing the corn starch with water mix it with the reserve lobster juice since the water realy does nothing. Enjoy :)

I had tried making lobster bisque with many different recipies, without much success. I had all but given up until this recipe came along. It is just rich enough, flavorful enough and creamy enough to satisfy even the most discriminating palate.

I thought this was fabulous, though very labor intensive. Turned it into a Sunday afternoon activity and had a second person help out. Made enough for 2 1/2 servings as a main course. The extra serving froze well. But be prepared to spend alot of time for very little return.

This is a short review: Good but not great. Not a complex mix of flavors. Will probably get good reviews from friends/family but not raves. Not as rich as I'd hoped. This seems to be the main problem. Very labor intensive and very expensive (but I should've known that). My advice - save the lobster from the bisque and have lobster for dinner!

My wife, who is from Oklahoma loves bisque..from the first time she ordered it( "I will have the BIS-KEY") at a Galveston get away I try to find many receipes to try..This one is good. I like to throw in a few minced jalapenos for a kick...

I made this tonight for dinner, and would not make it again. It did not have the depth of flavor that I am used to for bisque. Boring. Waste of my time.

I'm not surprised the recipe was salty, considering the lobster is cooked in salted water, which is then partly reserved for cooking liquid. A better method is to not salt the water, and adjust the seasonings later. You'll find the lobster releases quite a bit of salt in it's juices. And don't use too much water, say three cups to cook the lobster in. The steam will kill the lobster just as effectively as the water would.

I followed this recipe again tonight. It has always been delicious--not overpowering, nor weak. Using fish stock really helps, but where I live it's hard to get it. So, I use anchovy paste [available in any supermarket aisle with tuna, sardines, etc.] and boiling water. Start with 1 Tbsp. in 4 cups of boiling water, then dilute it to taste for saltiness. Add stock, diluted to taste, in amount specified in the recipe. Freeze what's left. Don't be afraid of anchovies. They add great depth of flavor if used properly. Fresher than boullion cubes, too. Also, I baked the bisque in ramekins [500 ml] topped with puff pastry, served with a salad. Make sure the pastry is sealed along the edge, so it doesn't slip into the bisque. Otherwise, it doesn't brown & puff, just stews. Really elegant.

I have not tried the recipe but I noticed the question posed by Montreal. One way I have found to reduce saltiness in soup is to add an uncooked peeled potato in large chunks. This soaks up some salt, and the chunks can be removed before serving.

I have just made the soup and find it salty...how can I reduce saltiness before serving tonite???

I made this recipe with leftover lobsters I had for Xmas dinner so I skipped the first step of the recipe. Made the basic broth the day before and just warmed up the broth and added the cream, lobster and cornstarch at the last minute. I added pototoes to the broth(removed before reheating) to absorb some the saltiness. Will definetly make it again.

This was okay. It was not thick, as others have said. It tasted good, just not what I expected. For as much time that goes into this I would have to love it to make again. I made it for a dinner party and everyone likes it, but my husband also noticed how thin it was. I had even added about 3 times more corn starch then called for and more cream. Better luck next time.

I made the recipe exactly as written, however the texture was not as thick as I would like it. Any suggestions? I am a mom of two and my eight year old loves trying new soups. She loves my honey and pumkin soup, but just likes my bisque. Lobster bisque is her favorite, but the recipe didn't excite her or the rest of the family. I enjoyed making it, but the texture was to thin. Thanks! K.

I made this last night and thought it was fabulous. I used just tails and used the shells for the stock . I couldnt find any proper fish stock so I used fish boullion cubes and the water I boiled the tails in. It was rather salty, but I think that was from the salted wter I used, I also put some saffron in it. Loved the tarragon flavor too.

to the cook on 12/31/01 -- you left out "celery, bay leaf, peppercorns, sherry, tarragon, and onion", and used veg stock instead of fish stock and skim milk instead of cream -- and you're wondering why this soup is not "beyond compare"? you left out many of the main flavoring ingredients! your comments are useful, since not everyone can stick to the exact recipe, but with that many alterations you shouldn't be rating the original recipe, because what you made was very different from it. please, if you make that many alterations, leave your comments but don't rate the recipe.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party, and everyone enjoyed it. We had a lobster/clam bake in Oct., so I used the lobster shells to make the recipe to the point of straining the stock, and then froze it. I made the bisque from that point, using the frozen stock and some fresh lobster. It turned out fine, and I didn't have the last-minute mess (and smell)!!!!

I made this for dinner tonight because I had a lonely 1 1/4 lobster hanging around the frig. In addition to the lobster meat I added baked fresh Tilefish. I basically doubled the recipe and made about 2 quarts of stock with one large bouillion of fish stock and the rest chicken bouillion. I added a stick of butter to the recipe and instead of putting vegetables through a strainer, I put them in a cuisinart and added the puree back into the stock. Very delicious!

I made this recipe for a large group Christmas Eve. Everyone raved. Because I was tripling, I added one pound shrimp, and one pound bay scallops (the little ones) and it was perfect. The broth was complex and all the flavors were there for the discerning palate. For those that just enjoy a delicious creamy seafood bisque, this also works. It is deceivingly rich so it went farther than I thought it would. Maybe because it was served with salad sprinkled with dried cranberries and homemade foccaccia with fresh rosemary. A memorable, yet simple meal.

This was quite good, but there are better lobster bisque recipes. Certainly, reviewers who left out the shells were missing out on a lot of flavour. I also don't understand why anyone would discard the roe (the red waxy matter). It adds not only flavour, but extra colour to the bisque. Whenever I make a lobster bisque, I always make sure I get female lobsters so I have the roe.

This was very, very good, but not beyond compare. I microwaved the lobster instead of boiling it. I omitted the celery, the bay leaf, the peppercorns, the Sherry, the tarragon, and onion. I could not find fish stock so I used canned vegetable stock instead. I also substituted skim milk for the heavy cream. It was too salty, but that is my fault, not the recipe's.

Made this for Christmas Eve - outstanding! Rich lobster flavor and great texture. I also substituted shallots for the onion, and right before I served the bisque, I added a bit more sherry for 'punch'. Couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day!

Outstanding! Just used this as the intro to our Christmas Eve dinner and it was fabulous. I did use lobster tails instead of the live lobster as others had suggested - thought the kids would freak over the live lobster. This seemed fine. Also - made up through adding tomato paste 2 days before. Refrigerated this and finished off with the cream and lobster just before eating. No leftovers! Will definitely make again for special occasions.

My husband and I had recently been to a 4 star french restraunt and tried Lobster Bisque for the first time and fell in love with it. I decided to try this recipe and followed the directions EXACTLY! I did use shallots instead of onion and just the lobster broth instead of fish stock. OH MY!! this is absoutely to die for! This is the best soup I have ever eaten! It is definately going to be put in our family cook book! The kids even loved it. There will be a fight tomorrow for the leftovers!

My son, the lobster bisque aficionado, who orders it in fine restaurants wherever it appears on the menu, said he thought it was the best bisque he'd ever eaten! I don't think he was trying to butter me up as all my other guests agreed. The depth of flavor that using the shells adds pushes it into the extraordinary range. Also, I used 2 1 1/2 lb. lobsters, which resulted in a very meaty bisque. Delicious!

This was good-really good. I forgot to get celery at the grocery store but it didn't really matter, I don't think it left anything out of the depth of the soup. I added a bit more cornstarch at the end and reduced as much as I could, it was already getting pretty late. Anyhoo, really great recipe. I really think one should use the shells, it doesn't really add any more time to the process if you're already using a live lobster. Speaking of which, my lobster freaked me out-it only went half in (head first) and started splashing and flapping it's tail wildly, spraying hot boiling water across the kitchen. My [future] mother-in-law and I started screaming and running away-quite a show. Also, to the cook who said the recipe was bland, that would be your fault, you're doing the cooking-not the recipe.

I used leftover lobster from last night's dinner. It turn out wonderful, and I did not even use fish stock instead I used chicken stock. If anyone does not like too mush fishy smell can try it but reduce the amount of chicken stock.

This is a wonderful recipie. I added frech crab to it once, and it turned out wonderful. I also like it with a little extra tomato paste. I froze it in individual containers last year, and it was even better now! Guess all that time really gave the flavors a chance to blend:)

This is not bad, Definately needs the corn starch to make it thicker. If you don't want to use a whole lobter, tails are fine.

This recipe is a lot of work, but it is a favorite in our house! I have tried this using the lobster shells and also not, and I highly recommend using them. It helps give it a more bold and complex flavor. I prefer a bit of a thicker soup, so I reduced it a little further and added more cornstarch...it's perfect!

I thought this bisque was outstanding, though I added a bit more sherry than it called for to punch up the flavor a bit. I would not recommend leaving the shells out as they add an incredible depth of flavor to the broth. I also noticed that it took longer than the recommended times to reduce the broth, that may influence the flavor if you go by the times given and not the direction to reduce by half.

Rating: 4
This is an incredible bisque recipe. I used a full cup of brandy and left out the sherry. I did not have a pot that was big enough to handle all of the shell parts, so I left them out of the cooking process. The soup came out incredibly smooth and flavorful. Made this soup for a New Year's dinner. I think I just started a new tradition!

Much work went into this - made my own fish stock, cooked the live lobsters - but the end product was very good. Our dinner guests liked it very much. I used whipping cream rather than heavy cream wanting to cut down on the "creaminess".

I made this recipie for me for Mother's Day and it was excellent. I did use the live lobsters and followed the recipie exactly and it was the very best. I used two l l/2 lbs. lobsters and I used cognac . My family loved it. Although it was more work to use the live lobsters, I think that the cooking of the shells with the aromatic vegtables added to the flavor.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve for my family and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes to cut down on preparation time. I did not use a live lobster, I used lobster meat. I did not use the lobster shells or tomalley. We thought the final product was great!

I have made this soup twice and it was a crowd pleaser each time. Today I brought it in to my office for everyone to try. There were rave reviews from everyone. It is by far the best bisqu i have ever made. To make prep easy I shred the veggies on a box grater. so much easier. I also use clam broth boulion, and I double the amount of carrot and celery.
