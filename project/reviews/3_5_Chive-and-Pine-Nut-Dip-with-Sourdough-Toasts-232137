It was too heavy for a 'dip'. The flavors are sort of nice, but this dish does not function well at a party.

Maybe I did something wrong, because these just did not come out right for me. The dip was runny and sour, and I usually love chives!

I didn't think this recipe was worth the effort. I loved the ingredients so I expected it to be better than it was. Maybe if I redo it with the previous reviewers add ins, it would be better. I'd give it another try but don't make it expecting people to rave over this one.

use a very good mascarpone (like vermont natural)and regular cream cheese mix. Add some fresh basil to the chive oil puree. Add some carmelized shallots to the cheese mixture. Add plenty of fresh ground black pepper. Add some sun dried tomatoes as garnish on top for a christmassy look along with the chive blossoms. My favorite appetizer to bring to a party

Great. Easy to do and great make ahead. I added a chive blossom on top.

I love all of these ingredients but this recipe was good but not great. At the end of my event, this was the only thing that was still left. It may be something to compliment other things but not good enough to stand on its own.

Delicious. A surprising garlic-y bite to the dish. I loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Great flavors! Easy to make.

I used goat cheese instead of cream cheese which I didn't have on hand and it was wonderful. I hated to discard the chives so used some of them in other dishes and in vinegrette. yum yum

Amazing! What a terrifically easy and impressive dish. Perfect as an appetizer, but would also be great as a sandwich spread or on burgers.

So easy and so very delicious. Did not even bother toasting my crusty sourdough. The pine nuts and chive oil are a wonderful combination.

This dip was excellent. The only thing I would do next time is not toast the bread.

This was so good my guests could not stop eating until it was gone. The chive oil is amazing on its own, so definitely make extra of that to drizzle on vegetables later. Will definitely make again, not only to use up the expensive mascarpone, but because family and friends have demanded it.

I made this for a neighborhood gathering and everyone raved about it.
