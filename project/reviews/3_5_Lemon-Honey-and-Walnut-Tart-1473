My neighbors have a walnut orchard and my brother has a lemon tree, so this recipe seemed like a "must try". We enjoyed it very much after a fondue dinner. I cheated, though, by using a store bought crust.

I have lost count of the dozens of times have made this tart. It is always a sure winner. Just the right combination of flavors and texture. Try topping with whipped cream sweetened with a touch of maple!

I've been making this since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. It always brings rave reviews at a dinner party.

I'd make this again b/c it's easy and quick, but it needs something. It's a different texture--kind of cake-y, and the cloves give it a different flavor.

I have made this tart several times and it always comes out well. It is relatively easy to make and people are usually impressed by the way it looks and tastes.

I have made this tart several times. It's a good winter desert. The cloves in the crust gives it a unique flavor.
