Hey Kristin Miller, how did you get a job writing recipes for Epicurious if you think that a drummette is a baby leg? For anyone considering making this recipe, a drummette is the upper part of a chicken wing. It's not the leg of a baby chicken.

It tasted pretty good. The one thing I would change is placing the ranch dressing in a salt shaker and sprinkling it on. After dipping the chicken in the hot sauce mixture, the dressing became gooey.

I'm a vegetarian, so the review comes from my kids, who are very picky eaters. I used it on chiken tenders, and my kids (and husband) thought they were really good.

I was surprised to see this, I've been making these for years! I like to cut the Ranch with some flour,though.

The dressing mix was way to over-powering when the chicken was rolled in it. I would suggest sprinkling it sparingly over the chicken.
