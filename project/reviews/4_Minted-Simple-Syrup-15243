Perfect, simple method. Love it.

I use minted simple syrup with mint juleps - helps cut the drink for non-bourbon drinkers! Keeps WAY longer than 2 weeks - only if all traces of leaves are removed. I dont chop which makes the straining easier.

Imagine! This syrup over lavender scones and mixed berries. Topped with a little whipped cream. Got a lot of WOWS!

So great to have this recipe here. I was making something and needed mint jelly but didn't have any, so I whipped this up instead and it worked great!

I was so glad to find this recipe. Who knew it would be so simple. I had had iced green tea with mint syrup in a restaurant and couldn't wait to make it at home. Fortunately I had mint growing in my yard since it takes A LOT of mint leaves to make 1 1/2 cups packed. I'm sipping my delicious iced tea as I type this. YUM!!!
