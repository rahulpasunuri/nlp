This recipe has promise. I used Japanese oriental noodles (Tomoshiraga Somen) which worked well, but I will undercook them a bit next time. I used sesame oil rather than canola, which added a nice flavor, and added water chestnuts for the crunch. Next time I'll slice the green onions into small rings rather than matchsticks and I'll add cilantro (as suggested in another review). I was making it for two and halved the recipe. I had lots of leftovers, for lunch tomorrow.

Its ok. Too much peanut sauce and not enough kick. But my guests loved it--so who am I to complain? :-)

I was so excited when I saw all the four fork reviews for this recipe. However I found it to be slightly bland. My company ate it up and even had seconds so I guess they approved. :-) But I have personally had better. Could be sweeter in my opinion.

I have made this recipe a number of times and always love it. I've added grilled chicken and shrimp and spiced it up and down with the red peppers and it always turns out well. I do find that I usually have a little extra sauce which I'm not usually sure what to do with, but still worth it.

I was very pleased with this recipe. The sauce is very good peanut sauce; it's quite thick and I had to thin it for the noodles, but my daughter used it as-is as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken. I added a sprinkle of sugar, like another reviewer did, and a few drops of sesame oil. For the noodles, I used slivered red and yellow pepper, carrots,and zucchini, but blanched them for 20 seconds to take the rawness out. I also tossed in some sliced water chestnuts for more crunch and some basil leaves.

I have made this numerous times, and have never gotten less than rave reviews from those eating it!! If I'm in a rush, I use broccoli slaw (shredded broccoli, carrots and cabbage) found in the vegetable section of the supermarket. Saves on all the chopping! Also agree - cilantro is a must!! As for noodles - I've used linguine with excellent results (I usually have packages on hand)!

Delicious. I used sesame oil instead of canola and did not include the cabbage. Make sure to cut the noodles as instructed! If not you will find difficulty mixing the vegatables. I seemed to need only half of the sauce.

Rating: 3
Made sauce as written, and quite liked it--used soba instead of "dried chinese noodles" and found those stood up to sauce quite well. (also slightly healthier) I'd cut out carrots & cabbage next time and add a sweeter crisper note--I agree w/reviewer below. Julienned cucumber and/or jicama would be perfect.

Really nice. I threw in some left over roast chicken which I felt made it better.

I've made it a zillion times before and will continue to do so. Everyone loves it. Super easy to make.

Rating: 3
So easy and so good. I added slivered pea pods and crisp bean sprouts to up the crunch factor -- really any crisp vegetable would be great. Great for picnics or an easy weeknight supper.

Yummy! I cook for just myself, and then eat the leftovers for the rest of the week, so it's important that it be good. I'll definitely look forward to these leftovers! I added tofu, extra chili sauce & crushed red peppers, and substituted spinach for cabbage: turned out great. My only concern is about the statement that this serves 6. 6 what?! Elephants? It made a frightening amount of food!

This dish is a staple for summer BBQs. It's a welcome change from cole slaw and potato salad. I make everything ahead and refrigerate separately and toss together just before serving. I make it exactly as written - you've got to try it :)

This was wonderful. I used three packages of the fresh noodles you find next to the tofu and eggroll wrappers...served it with simple baked chicken thighs on top, with a warm salad of Japanese eggplant on the side. I added extra peanuts. People loved it and asked to take leftovers home. I think it's better hot, or at least warm.

Rating: 3
Yummy. I liked the bok choy and other vegetables with the noodles. I also added broccoli florets, and substituted rice vinegar for balsamic. Sometimes you need more than a 1:2 ratio of water to peanut butter to thin the sauce down enough.

This was okay, not great. I really liked all the vegetables and is great on a hot day.

I have been looking for this recipe for months. Lost the magazine in a move and thought I would never see it again.. Very good and filling. We really liked the peanut sauce and have used it in other dishes. This is yummy and healthy.

This was great. I used 1/2 cup of peanut butter ("natural", meaning just peanuts) which gave plenty of flavor though I did add 2 tsp brown sugar to the rest of the sauce ingredients. Also added shrimp and snowpeas to the vegetables listed and an 8-oz pkg of udon noodles -- delicious results!

very easy to make peanut sauce. we ate this dish hot very tasty.

I like cold noodle/vegetable dishes as a companion to richer dishes, like the spicy beef short ribs I served with this. The vegetables are fantastic, but the carrots and all the cabbage make it a bit too "earthy". I also substituted ingredients: bean sprouts for the cabbage, and I added cucumber to add more sweetness. I chose to use a bottled peanut sauce instead of making it and it was just delicious.

Great alternative to regular salads. Loved the combination of vegetables and pasta. The peanut sauce was awesome. I think next time I will use a bit less soy to cut down on the salt. Overall a unique tasty salad dish.

Rating: 4
excellent, my guests couldn't get enough of it. I substituted a couple of cups of frozen oriental vegetables for the rest of the veggies, and it was great. I chose to serve it warm as I don't like raw veggies with noodles. I just threw everything into the same pot, used fresh udon noodles and cooked everything for 2 minutes. then I drained them , added the sauce, and mmmmm!

My dinner guests and I love this dish and I have made is several times already. Of course I never follow a recipe like this exactly as written. My changes include adding red cabbage, snow peas, and cilantro and substitute crushed peanuts for the sesame seeds. I believe peanut sauces are a thing of individual taste and need lots play to find perfection. I always begin with natural peanut butter- it gives the sauce a much better flavor. I will agree this recipe calls for too much garlic! Try adding fresh ginger or honey and keep playing with your ingredients!

To answer Monterey's question about chili garlic sauce, an excellent brand can be found in the Asian section of some larger supermarkets: Tuong Ot Toi Viet-Nam (I did not include the appropriate accent marks). It comes in an 8-ounce plastic bottle with a rooster on the label and a green lid. It was recommended to me by chef /teacher Hugh Carpenter in a cooking class and has always proven to be a winner. It's a red-colored sauce with bits of chili peppers, it's not an oil. Hope this helps, albeit very late.

I made this dish for a book club pot-luck. It made a very large amount and got raves.

This was a huge hit at my dinner party. I did cut back on the garlic quite a bit, but I also doubled the recipe and it doubled quite easily. I'd definately make it again but would probably add shrimp or chicken.

I tried this recipe in my quest to replicate a dish from a local restaurant, and I agree with the previous reviewers that it is more complicated than necessary, and uses needlessly expensive ingredients. I was much, much happier with a Ming Tsai recipe found at: http://www.foodtv.com/recipes/PrinterFriendlyPage/0,1734,14193,00.html Simple, easy, and very tasty.

I didn't think this dish was worth making again. The peanut sauce was not very peanutty tasting and was very overwhelmingly garlicky. It was unfortunate to have to throw away such a large batch of expensive ingredients.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. My guests loved it and have all requested the recipe. Great cruncy veggies, nice mixing of sweet and spicy. But I'd add serrano or jalepeno peppers next time. It's not quite fire-y enough for us. Chicken and shrimp would make great additions as other people suggested. I served it with an Asian flank steak and it was quite yummy.

The peanut sauce was totally overpowering and one-dimensional. We were sad! Also, "udon" (Japanese) is different from "chow mein" (Chinese), so there's no such thing as "dried chow mein udon."

We love the recipe, but instead of eating it cold we prefer it hot.

To answer the chili-garlic sauce question: in the Asian market it is called chili-garlic paste, sauce or just chili-garlic. Personally, I prefer to add chopped garlic to dishes and use chili paste. A good hot one is Chili Red Pepper by Comrade Food, Master Sauce Co., LTD.

Excellent!! I used seasame oil instead of canola oil. The dressing really likes our authentic Chinese cold noodles sauce. (reply to the previous reviewer.....chili garlic sauce is a sauce, not oil.)

I have not yet made this dish because I'm uncertain which kind of chili-garlic sauce to use; is it an actual sauce or an oil?

I have been looking for noodles with spicey peanut sauce. This one did the trick! Nice and spicey, vegetables were great but would probably blanch them next time and grilled chicken or shrimp would be a great addition. Makes a great side dish or main course. Made great leftovers too!

Rating: 3
I used 16oz of fresh, refrigerated udon noodles from a oriental grocery store. I think dried noodles would have been better. My noodles were too dry and "floury". My husband loved the dish, loved the spiciness. We used only 1 red pepper, 4 bok choy stems, and added some cucumber. We did not add any cabbage, and didn't miss it. This dish is great with a lot of variations!

I HAVE ONLY TRIED THIS DISH WITH A VARIATION AND I CANNOT IMAGINE IT WITHOUT, ADD LOTS OF FRESH CILANTRO IN THE LAST STAGES.....WOW!

Everyone loved this! Great will grilled chicken. The sesame seed added that something special. Next time I'll try adding some grilled shrimp.

I made this dish using Ramen noodles and plain cabbage. It was delicious and my kids and their friends loved it. It's nice too because most ingredients were already in my pantry.

This is a great recipe for a potluck or luncheon. To make it more substantial for my non-vegetarian friends, I like to add poached shredded chicken. Also, I like to steam the vegies for several minutes so they are not completely raw.

Rating: 3
I'm not a big fan of super spicy, so I found this very tasty. I did, however, add about an inch of fresh ginger, peeled and minced, and 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro for extra flavor. I also followed the others suggestion and added grilled chicken. Making this at the last minute, I was not able to find the asian noodles at our small town grocery store, so I had to substitute angel hair pasta, but still found it to be pretty good!

Rating: 4
We made it extra hot. The heat with the cold vegies and then added marinated grilled chicken. It was great because we often entertain vegetarians and meat-eaters. Both can be satisfied with the scrumptious flavors.

I made it extra spicy and added peanut sauce instead of peanut butter. Then I marinated tofu chunks in the sauce while the noodles cooked and cooled. Bean sprouts were also a wonderful addition. My husband loved it.

This dish is easy to prepare with a good amount of chopping. The first time I served it I got requests for the recipe.

I made the recipe without any alterations and both my husband and I thought it was delicious. It holds well for a couple of days with the veggies staying remarkably crunchy. I served it with grilled, marinated (soy, cilantro, garlic, ginger) chicken tenders on skewers which was a nice addition. Will definitley make this again.

I've been looking for the ultimate "Peanut Noodle" recipe -- this was good, but didn't quite make it. The addition of some shredded chicken would make it more appealing.
