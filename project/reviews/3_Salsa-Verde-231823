This sauce is bright and fresh and an absolute must with the Anchovy and Rosemary Roasted Lamb. The combo have been my favorite since the recipes were published in 2005.

This was intended to be served with the Anchovy and Rosemary Roasted Lamb, but of course I forgot to serve it (it would have been delicious) so I used it as a dip for crudites several days later and we all thought it was HEAVENLY!

It was my first time making a Salsa Verde and I found it too oily. i added 1/2 teaspoon of mustard and some thyme in sub of the mint (I thought I had it but it was bad)
