I enjoyed this recipe a lot. I made sure to season with sea salt and freshly ground pepper. I sauteed scallops with garlic, lemon infused olive oil, and onion and added these to the dish. This went well and added a buttery burst of flavor to the dish!

Yummy and easy to prepare ahead of time. Never have a problem roasting peppers as described here. Substituted white wine for the water and allowed sauce to simmer uncovered longer than directed. Tastes much better when allowed to chill for a few hours and reheat. Definitely a recipe that allows you to be creative.

I found the flavor of this recipe rather bland. Roasting the red peppers was a pain; mine soaked through the bottom of the bag and fell on the floor so be careful. If I was to ever make this again I would definitely just buy the prepackaged kind; the taste would be the same. I'm not a big fan of cheese, but without the romano this recipe would have had no flavor.

This is a very easy and quick dish to make on a hot summer day. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is alright, if a little bland. I found roasting the peppers in the paper bag was a messy hassle. I recommend using the jarred kind, adding some chopped sundried tomatoes and Nicoise olives.

Upon researching a fast and easy pasta dish to prepare for an impromptu dinner, I came across this recipe. It was absolutely delicious; I will definitely prepare it again. If you're short on time, I would suggest doing the sauce beforehand as suggested.

This was some work to prepare but the overall taste was delicious and worth making again. I used canned chopped olives which were diced a bit to finely. Next time I'll use whole olives and slice them myself.
