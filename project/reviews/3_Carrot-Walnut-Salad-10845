I've given it two forks just because I'm a carrot-lover but that's about it. There's nothing special about this recipe. If you ask me, toasting the walnuts is just a pain. Try shredded cabbage (not the really hard variety they have in UK - it's only good for cole slaw) with shredded carrots, olive oil, lemon, salt. Yum.

This is an easy salad to make, and it is refreshing to eat -- lots of crunch! Just grate the carrots on your cheese grater, add the rest of the ingreds, and you are done.
