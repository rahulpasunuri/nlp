I made this only slightly different--I used 4 different types of olives--all with pits. The flavor was awesome and 6 guests loved this. It is really two separate dishes though. I served the feta on a plate and olives in an olive dish. Guests could eat both or one or the other. I agree with cutting up the feta for serving. I am making the marinated olives again this weekend because my hubby & I like to snack on them (I will also add jarred whole mushrooms, celery, thinnly slice onion and pepperoncini's for more of an "olive salad"). Really yummy.

This recipe came up short for me and my guests. The sheer volume of spice turned off some of my less adventurous diners. And then the cumbersome nature of the dish (as I prepared it) turned off others. It's not a spread and it's not a salsa and people had a hard time figuring out how to get it on the bread rounds. Be sure to cut the feta into very small cubes. VERY small. Dice the olives, too. Like another reviewer said, this is an expensive dish. I probably won't make it again.

This was amazing. I used some of the marinade from the olives to spoon over the feta, which was a great hit. Delicious!

I have made this dish so many times! I skip making my own marinated olives, and just buy them from the olive bar. Rarely is there a morsel left behind. Serve with crackers or rounds of French bread.

Easy to make, and great for snacking and adding to salads!

I made this appetizer for an Easter Dinner we attended. It was delicious and I got so many compliments I was embarrassed. I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the oil and lemon in half. I added a can of quartered artichoke hearts, drained. I used French Feta cheese and pitted Kalamata Olives both from a deli. Use Extra Virgin Olive Oil and if you have any fresh basil available I put 2 Tablespoons of coarsely chopped basil on top. Only marinate the olives in the dressing for 2 hours. On a platter place the 1/2 inch cubes of feta, atichoke hearts that have been drained. I did not marinate the feta .Right before serving pour the olives and the marinate over the feta and artichokes, top with basil chopped and garnish with basil for presentation. I toasted pita wedges, and sliced french bread on a large cookie sheet. I did not bother using the lemon peel. Dash of salt and pepper to taste,yes. The key is quality ingredients if available.Enjoy

I made this for a crowd and it was well received. However, the flavors are strong and probably not to everyone's liking. I served with a couple of other simple appetizers (i.e. a wedge of brie with crackers) and the combination seemed to meet the tastes of all. Those who DID like the hearty flavor of this recipe ate it enthusiastically.

Considering the cost of this dish, I will not be making it again. While there was nothing wrong with it, next to everything else I made, well let's just say almost all of it's in my fridge the morning after.

I was worried that it would be to oily,as it turns out the marinade is great for dipping bread!!Of course the olive oil is going to coagulate in the fridge!! Just set it out an hour or so before serving and it will be perfect!!!!!

We were short of time and skipped the overnight refrigeration, and everything was still incredible! We used the best feta, olives and olive oil we could find, and everyone loved it.

I had high expectations for this recipe, but it didn't turn out well for me at all - when the mixture was chilled overnight, the olive oil turned into a congealed mass of green goo at the bottom of the bag. Perhaps I did something wrong? I believe I will give this recipe another chance, and just for fun, try using cubed mozzarella instead of feta and marinating it along with the olives. If I can get this recipe to work for me, I believe I'll be using it a lot, as it's very easy and it transcends seasons (it would be equally at home either as a holiday appetizer or at a summer picnic). Better luck next time.

Simple, savory and different. However, the outcome will vary widely depending on the quality of the olive oil. This is when to use the good stuff.

Out of this world! My partner and I agree, this is our favorite appetizer. I made this recentley for one of our bbq's, I think that at some point everyone commented on this dish.

Absolutely delicious! I used good feta to begin with and it only got better after marinating. I ate the leftovers for lunch with my turkey sandwich- yum!

I was searching for something simple yet interesting to entice the most eclectic of dinner guests...This is simple to prepare and is one of the best appies I've had in a long time! I highly recommend it to novices and "seasoned" cooks alike.

The only downfall to this dish is that folks tend to fill up on it before the main course comes out. It was a major hit!

I'm not an olive eater, but I made this for a BBQ party and one of our guests couldn't stop eating it. A definite hit.
