This is one of my favorite fall recipes. I do add a little Old Bay seasoning which really adds a nice flavor to the soup. Serve this with a nice baguette and you have a wonderful meal.

Excellent! But seems HARD to get right due to variability in flavors of pumpkin and shrimp. Several times, I went w/ the recipe and had both excellent an horrible results. Not sure why. Then started using this as a starting point and really following the taste-buds that worked better. I actually prefer this w/ coconut milk. Added cajun spices once and was excellent.

My family enjoyed this. Served it with bread and a salad for dinner. I added a jar of clam juice to the broth. Fresh sage is a must.

I had this tonight for a casual dinner party. The flavor was excellent. I did add a pinch of smoked paprika which did seem to kick it up a notch. I also thought it needed a teaspoon of sugar. The next time I make it I will change the 3 cups of broth to 4 cups. I thought it was to thick even for bisque.

The secret to this soup is the shrimp stock. The first time I made it, it was fantastic! I thought the flavors mingled very well. The next year I made it, I accidentally used 2 cans of pumpkin instead of 2 cups! It was very bland indeed and masked the yummy goodness of the shrimp stock. I plan to make it today!

Good, takes a little time but thought it was easy to make. I used 1 cup of clam juice and 2 cups of chicken broth as others suggested. Though I used a pound of the shrimp shells, cooked only half a pound of the shrimp to distribute for the soup.

This recipe made a great bisque. I only made a few alterations to the way it is written. First, I added a cup of clam juice to the stock preparation. I also added a little extra lemon juice to the pumpkin - cream mix, as well as some nutmeg and cinnamon. Finally, while the bisque was simmering, I added five diced shrimp. I was a little worried at first because the pumpkin flavor was a little overwhelming. However, I left it at a low simmer most of the day and then finished with a touch of dry sherry. The final product was amazing. Creamy, smooth with a little bit of cayenne kick as a finish. Highly recommended.

Every year for the the last 6 yrs my mother-in-law has mentioned that this dish was the worst they have ever had at our very first Thanksgiving Day feast together. We tried to fix it, no good! We tried to eat it, no good! Now this dish and my cooking will live in infamy. I think this dish more appropriately deserves 0 forks.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe. I am a little bit mystified by some of the other reviews and how varied they are. One says "too many strong competing flavors" another says "too subtle". My guess is that the quality of the shrimp makes all the difference. I roasted one pound of shrimp shells but then used only two shrimp per person since it was served as part of Thanksgiving dinner! Excellent sweet and savory flavors. It also is not really as labor intensive as some of the other reviews imply, especially if you used canned organic pumpkin as I did.

Rating: 3
I thought that this was good, but I was really expecting it to be exceptional. I'm not really sure why it wasn't it has all of the makings of a great soup. Perhaps the type of pumpkin I used was not flavorful enough. I wonder if clam juice would be better than chicken stock? I would say that this is a recipe for a special occasion because it does take a lot of attention to make.

Excellent! I bought pumpkins at the farmers market, and was looking for something to do with all the pumpkin puree I made. I didn't think I liked pumpkin that much, but fresh puree is so much better than canned. I used store bought seafood stock, and light cream, and it was fabulous. Now with the leftover frozen puree I can make this quick and easy for weeknights.

Wow, this was good. I'll freeze & save shrimp shells in the future to toast for bisque, they smelled fantastic in the pan.

This was really good despite my modifications! I cooked the shrimp shells longer than recommended and then used a combination of 2/3 half-and-half and 1/3 soy milk (it's what I had on hand). I roasted the pumpkin myself instead of using pumpkin puree (and should have then run it through the blender but didn't). I may try with precut and peeled butternut squash from the store in order to save time. The taste was pretty fabulous, and I wish I'd made more than a half-recipe.

My sister-in-law made this for Thanksgiving last year and I loved it so much I changed my Christmas Eve menu to include it, and everyone LOVED it! I made it with butternut squash and a bit more shrimp, and it's really tasty! Baking my own butternut is definitely worth the time, as using homemade stock, which I keep in the freezer all the time.

Rating: 3
Followed the recipe pretty closely (except for adding 3 cloves of garlic and sauteing the veggies with browned shrimp shells to release more flavor) and even added a couple dashes of fish sauce but found that it lacked depth and seafoody-ness. It has potential tho --and could be improved by using more shrimp shells, which are easy to save & freeze.

Hated it. Followed the recipe to a "T" and was unable to serve the soup for Thanksgiving. Too many strong, competing flavors. Save your money and time and find a different soup to make.

You can barely tell there is pumpkin in the recipe if it weren't for the gorgeous orange color of the bisque. The pumpkin serves mostly as a thickener and this base could easily be used for any type of seafood bisque. I found the stock to be mild the first time I made this and ended up simming the stock longer the second time and using Penzys Seafood Base for more flavor. I also like a bit more kick and used more cayenne. Enjoy!

Fabulous! This takes time but all excellent recipes do. Well worth it! There is no instructions on how to cook the pumpkin so I roasted it in the oven after I cut it up into 2" cubes. My son brought home a sugar pumpkin for Halloween. After it sat around as decoration, instead of throwing it out, I decided to make pumpkin bisque. Found this recipe and now I am glad my son brought home the sugar pumpkin.

This soup was excellent, and was the first bisque I've made where I didn't feel compelled to doctor it with additional claim juice because the shrimp had been lost to the cream. That being said, I've learned to save old shrimp shells, and used at least 3X the number of shrimp shells to make this stock, but overall it's really an excellent recipe. The subtle flavors of shrimp, pumpkin and cream all come together very nicely.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving as a first course and used Butternut Squash that I roasted in the oven. It was FABULOUS! A real hit with everyone.The non-shrimp eaters at the table were served just the bisque and were quite happy too. It has already been requested for next year.

Delicious and well worth the effort. I am currently in France and have NO trouble finding full-bodied shrimp, even though I eventually de-corticated them and just used the shells of the bodies. Perfectly sweet pumpkin here that is grayish-orange, that I roasted in the oven with a little olive oil. I found that 1 recipe only made about 4 generous first course servings, not 8 as stated in the recipe. Serving it this weekend for 12 and so will double the recipe twice. That will take up my day Friday but I think it's worth the effort. Excellent!

This is the first time I've made a seafood bisque and it was wonderful! I sauteed the whole Gulf shrimp, including the heads, until they started to brown, as suggested. As an added bonus, this slight cooking made the heads really easy to remove! I had to keep my children out of the kitchen while making the broth though because I didn't think they'd eat "shrimp- head" soup. I used roasted fresh pumpkin since I had it on hand but next time will try canned, for convenience. I didn't have saffron so used a pinch of cumin. The whole family loved it, even my shrimp- hating 10 year old!

Rating: 4
Wonderful, but a bit time consuming. I used a roasted butternut squash which I roasted cut side down with a little olive oil at 400 degrees for 70 min. then pureed. Definitely need to make the shrimp stock as written. This makes the soup savory. Subsitituted 1/2 & 1/2 for heavy cream, but later added a roux to thicken a bit. Double recipe yielded 8 cups. Am freezing for Thanksgiving and will cook the shrimp before serving.

Rating: 4
I make my own shrimp stock all the time, and this was a great use for it. Loved the shrimp and pumpkin combination, though I would have liked more shrimp. As it was, I reserved half the soup and poached some orange roughy chunks in it the next day and served it over rice...also very yummy. I also added more cayenne, as I like spicy.

Rating: 4
This was one of the best new recipes I have tried in years. I'm having a hard time reconsiling the bad reviews. Use real pumpkins, not canned, roast them well to carmalize sugars and don't skip the saffron. Tastes varry, but I've got everything from a wife with a sophistocated pallate to a 4 year old who doesn't like fish in the house, and everyone LOVED this Bisque.

My husband loves cooked pumpkin so I thought I'd give this receipe a try. Some changes which I thought enhanced the flavor included: Sauting the shrimp in their shells (with heads if available in your area) then add the wine (I have also use vodka as it really brings out the shrimp flavor without competing too much with the pumpkin. Don't over cook the shrimp which is easy to do if they are not large; cool and shell the shrimp after cooking (the shells will then give flavor to the shrimp as well as the stock/sauce; finally, do not omit the saffron which adds character and direction to the dish (if this is too much for your budget try cumin). I also added sauted scallops and served it in shallow bowls.

This got such rave reviews I had to try it, but we couldn't even stand to eat more than a bite or two. The shrimp stock so overwhelmed everything else it was unpalatable.

A lot of work for spectacularly bland results. Who knows, maybe my baby pumpkin wasn't ready for prime time or my shrimp shells too thin, but next time I'll just keep the shrimp part and find a more flavorful base soup recipe. Spare yourself the expense of the saffron -- you can't taste or see it under the pumpkin. And I regret taking the recipe's suggestion for roasting the pumpkin in water -- I should have just followed Deborah Madison's genius method of brushing the cut sides with olive oil and putting them face down on a baking sheet. 1 hour at 400 degrees, and you've got perfectly roasted squash with lovely caramelization.

I was actually looking for a recipe that had squash and shrimp together as a bisque... voila! here it is. I made almost double recipe, my husband and I are big eaters and we had it as a main dish. My variations were: using bottled fish sauce diluted with watrer for 1/4 of the chicken stock, half cream, half coconut milk, and slightly more shrimp. I added a little bit of Old Bay seasoning and File powder (just a hint) to the base soup and used butternut squash that I roasted...didn't find I needed to drain it to get body. Results: a luscious silky textured bisque that was very yummy but subtle. I didn't use saffron due to the cost factor. Not sure what I may have missed with that omission.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times over the years, and I always make it exactly as written, except I have used half n half instead of heavy cream and it turned out fine, only less rich. I do use canned pumpkin, because I believe it's just as good as fresh and significantly cuts down on the hassle. This recipe is a hands-down winner. There's no way to go wrong. Just be sure to make the stock as directed -- it is delectable! And it's a good stock to have on hand in general, for other uses. My freezer stays full of shrimp shells for this very reason.

I've made this soup every Thanksgiving now for at least the past 5 years and its always a hit. Like many people I've never added saffron I think given all the flavours saffron would get lost so why waste it. I once cut corners and used canned pumpkin but roasting butternut squash is much better. You miss out on the caramel goodness of the roasted squash if you use canned. You can also skip the sage if you don't like it, I've made it with and without, and both ways its delicious. I also add garlic to the shrimp at the end gives it a little extra something something :) Enjoy.

Absolutely love this dish and have received many compliments on it. I substitute butternut squash for the pumpkin, and usually use lobster instead of shrimp. I go a bit heavier on the sage and the peppering than what is recommended in the recipe as well, which adds nuance to the pumpkin/squash flavor instead of letting the squash overwhelm. Definite hit!

Like several people who have commented, I didn't much care for this soup. I thought the pumpkin just overwhelmed it. HOWEVER, this recipe for Shrimp Stock is simply AWESOME. I now use for everything involving shrimp. I am flummoxed on how to rate this, thought, so I won't.

I like trying recipes when I can't imagine what they'll taste like. The pumpkin/shrimp combo was intriguing, but I didn't think they would blend well. Some flavors enhance each other or combine in a unique way. This was just confusing. It was fun to make, and my guests complimented it. I like a simpler pumpkin or pumpkin/wild rice soup. Perhaps swordfish or scallops would have worked better as a seafood addition. I don't think shrimp and pumpkin work. The only change I made in the recipe was using veggie broth and a bottle of clam juice rather than the chicken stock, for a vegetarian recipe.

This is by far the best shrimp bisque I have ever had. I have made it many times, and it always comes out perfect. I have always made it with canned pumpkin, my only suggestion is to make sure you do not use more than the scant 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. This is now a family tradition!

Luscious! I made this soup for Thanksgiving dinner but did not serve it because I had made so many other dishes that time and appetites were running out. So I had the soup for dinner tonight. I made it the day before Thanksgiving, and it kept perfectly until now. As the recipe suggested, I buried the shrimp in ice, and it stayed fresh. I used canned pumpkin; it tasted great. I would double the recipe next time, as other reviewers suggested. The servings would have been very small for eight people. With this soup, leftovers would not be a bad thing. Also, the soup was good without the shrimp. Instead of putting the shrimp in the soup, I might use the shrimp for some sort of canape to accompany the soup. The fresh sage is essential.

Halfed the recipe--was only serving two as a first course, but it would not have served 4. I served the shrimp with a cup-a cup and a half each of the soup and had a cup or less remaining. The pumpkin tasted bitter before serving so I added about 1 tb (for half of recipe) of honey, which did the trick and worked nicely with the little kick from the cayenne.

Rating: 3
I prepared all but the shrimp the day before. When tasting it I found it to be extremely bland and an overwhelming pumpkin flavor that masked the subtle flavor of the shrimp stock. It also was clearly not enough to serve six. Fortunately I had extra shrimp so I made another half batch of the stock and added that, and tripled the cayenne. I also used medium sized shrimp (and a bit more than the recipe called for) so that guests could have more than two shrimp. The next day I added additional salt, pepper and cayenne and found it to be acceptable. My guests raved about it and I had enough for some to have an additional helping. Next time I will increase everything (except the pumpkin) one and a half times (1.25 pounds of shrimp worked well) when I start out so I don't have the extra work.

Tried this recipe and it turned out great. I'm sure a key componant is using fresh pumpkin and not canned. Also, the quality and freshness of the shrip surely make a difference, but ahhh the smell of the roasting shells is heavenly! It's quite rich so adding a dollop of sour cream might be a bit much. I prefer to roast the seeds and sprinkle over soup bowls before serving. Ended up being a big hit at the dinner table.

This goes into my "oh, mercy" pile for soup recipes. The Herbfarm cookbook is one of my favorites, and everything I've made from it is outstanding. This is just perfect.

Definitely get shrimp in the shells; the stock won't be the same without them.

I was looking for something different to try for Thanksgiving. After reading the great reviews and the recipe, it sounded like a winner.

UNBELIEVABLE RECIPE!! I made this bisque as the first course for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it. My husband (who can be a somewhat finicky eater) raved about it for *days*. And, my mother-in-law (who always gives her honest opinion--like it or not) said she would make this a tradition every year. I almost passed up on buying the saffron for this dish, as I was shocked by the price ($16.99!), but surprising I found it in the organic section of my grocery store for half the cost. It did give it a really nice flavor. And, I used canned pumpkin...don't know if fresh would have been better...but to me it was worth the timesavings and the dish was just wonderful.

I am so glad that pumpkin season is here. I cannot wait to make this recipe again. We gobbled it up the first time I made it. Now we are going to have a Soup Party and bring our favorite soups....I am bringing this one!!! YUM

Excellent soup. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. It does take a lot of time and effort. But, if you have the time it is wonderful addition to a meal.

I had a similar dish in Jamaica, so was pleased to find this recipe. Would I make this dish again? I already have! Awesome. I added a bit extra cayenne pepper for an a little extra kick. Scallops might also work well in this dish.

I made this soup last Thanksgiving. Something different from the traditional menu. It does take some work but it's worth it. Everybody loved it! especially my daughter who loves shrimp.

I've made this three times - twice following the recipe exactly - the third time substituting butternut squash for the pumpkin and substituting cardomon and cumin for the sage. The first two times I served it, I received rave reviews. The third time was even more of a hit. What a great soup!

Jerry Traunfeld is a culinary genius - if you ever get the chance (and $) to go to the Herbfarm, do so! This recipe was the hands-down winner of a recent family dinner. Even those who are finicky eaters cleaned their bowls and were looking for seconds. I didn't change a thing from the given recipe and it came out fantastic. This will become a tradition in my family for Thanksgiving!

I have already made this about three times. The first time, I too found something missing--so I added some dry sherry at the very end. That seemed to do the trick!

Sensational! This was an impressive and delicious first course for Christmas dinner, and presented beautifully. My guests loved it. Followed directions and quantities exactly, making the puree with butternut squash as outlined in the end notes. I did work the puree through a fine strainer for an extra-smooth result and I recommend this extra step. One comment - this served four of us with about one serving left over (about one cup each, plus the shrimp). I don't see how this recipe as written would serve eight.

I was a bit nervous about hitting my family with this for Thanksgiving, they can be a bit boring, but it was a huge success. I substituted lobster for the shrimp (they live in Maine) and changed out the sage for a more middle-eastern spice mixture. I used mostly coriander with some cumin and a dash of cardamon (the secrect ingredient) as my main spices, with just a hint of red pepper, but don't make the mistake of using chili powder, you don't want it to taste like a burrito. I finished it with some lemon juice, cream (or course) and a couple shots of sherry. They loved it, even my dad who swears he doesn't like pumpkin and only eats lobster once a year and complained I'd make the house smell gross (which the lobster did NOT do). Whatever you do, make this soup, you'll love it.

Amazing! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone walked away from the table remembering this soup, not the turkey! It was very simple and easy considering the full breadth of flavor the soup has...Highly Recommended for a dinner party!

This soup was the perfect start to a Thanksgiving meal. However, I felt that base was a bit thick when the recipe was followed.

UNBELIEVABLE! Made this for a dinner party and the guests were blown away! I used fresh pumpkin and was pleasantly surprised how the soup didn't have a heavy pumpkin taste like some other pumpkin soups I've had. I also used soy milk instead of the heavy cream which didn't compromise flavor at all! In fact, I later tried it again with the cream and it was too filling for just a first course. Definately take the time to make the shrimp stock..it made all the difference!! YUMMY and impressive!!

I thought this recipe was very good but missing something in flavor. I followed the recipe to the T and couldn't put my finger on what was missing. So I added some Emeril essence and sauted the shrimp in the essence too. Still something was missing. Overall a great recipe and I will definitely make again. The basic taste was great and not at all what I was expecting. My guests thought it was great too but lacking a certain flavor your taste buds are looking for!

This soup is delicious! You must follow the directions exactly, particularly with regard to the roasted shrimp shells. I made a couple of adjustments: 1)I used an immersible blender to emulsify and smooth the texture of the soup after I added the pumpkin to the shrimp stock; 2)Since this soup was part of a large Thanksgiving dinner, I made it 2 days ahead. I put one sprig each of sage and bay leaf into the soup as it sat in the refrigerator. I removed it after I reheated the soup for serving.

This soup was fantastic! I pureed the whole 2 pounds except for maybe 10 shrimp which I used for garnish. The pumpkin flavor was barely noticeable (I made fresh), but must add to the flavor since this soup was just unbelievable. I used light cream and it didn't compromise the flavor one bit. Make this soup!

Very very delicious. I also omitted the saffron and frankly, I didn't miss it either. Would definitely try cutting the shrimp up next time, as I think they stuck out a little bit whole. Am interested in the tarragon idea, too, although the sage was great.

Two of my guests for Thanksgiving 2001 had very unsophisticated palates and one had never even tried shrimp in this day and age! My husband hates pumpkin so I didn't tell him what was in the soup. The whole pot went quite quickly. I did use saffron (despite some of the reviews) and thought it did add depth. Next time, I'm considering trying the tarragon suggestion. I would not omit the flashed shrimp at the end though, it makes the presentation.

Really good, really easy. Just a half-pound of shrimp is fine. Our advice: don't omit the salt. I never cook with salt (ever) but this is one recipe where I'll have to break my rule - the flavor really is enhanced with salt. Without it, something is definitely missing.

This really turns out well, and the smell from the kitchen when making the shrimp stock is absolutely heavenly. I used some Persian saffron I brought back from the Middle East, but it only added color and no flavor. So don't bother. I used canned pumpkin, but it is a little over-powering - so either make your own (per the recipe) or use less. Finally, next time I'll substitute tarragon, instead of the sage, for more sophistication and depth. Best of all, my kids LOVED this, and both of them rated it FOUR FORKS. It is well worth trying and I recommend it to anyone, but don't be afraid to play with it a little to suit your own personal tastes.

Not wanting to go to the expense of Saffron, I substituted 3 tsp of curry powder. I sprinkled the sauteed shrimp with Creole seasoning and chopped the shrimp before serving. Garnished with Parmesan and Cilantro, this dish was incredible! P.S. As the recipe states, the shrimp stock is the key to the entire project, so do it right.

YUM! yum yum yum! i thought that the soup was a bit too sweet and buttery. so i chopped up some of the shrimp and added those to the final simmer stage, along with an extra half-pound of [peeled, cleaned] shrimp and the juice and zest of one-half a lemon. this cut the squashiness just enough.

The flavor combinations are wonderful. I will omit the shrimp garnish next time...they don't add much to the flavor and it whole shrimp are difficult to eat with a spoon.

Have you tried the bisque? Oh, you've got to try the bisque... I think fresh pumpkin is a must... canned is a crime - "no soup for you"! :)

SUPERB!!! This soup was absolutely excellent. I used butternut sqush instead of pumpkin and homemade chicken broth that I had made ahead and froze. It was so easy and yet elegant and delicious at the same time. A definate dinner party WOWer!! I also agree that you could cut down on the amount of shrimp but if you really want to impress stick with the original amount! So yummy I am already planning the next occasion to serve it! Don't miss this one!

I love soups. This is one of my favorites. Fabulous flavor, and great for entertaining because I can make all but the shrimp ahead. A bit time consuming.

Delicious! Wonderful combination of flavors. Will try the squash variation in the future.

The shrimp base was fantastic--light and delicately balanced but the pumpkin --yuk! Perhaps it was because I used canned pumpkin, but it was not good.

i thought this recipe was very easy to follow let along make.It was very tasty.I did not have time to use fresh pumpkin but i did use canned and it was very tasty.My husband loves bisque so i thought this would be a great starter for thanksgiving.He said i could make it any time.Even my 2 1/2 year old loved it.

Yes, it was tremendous. Mr. Traunfeld's timeline did much to ease the last minute Thanksgiving dinner frenzy. The reviewer's suggestion to decrease the number of shrimps is well taken, although it might be fun to puree some of the sauteed shrimps and add into the whisked soup.

Absolutely everyone loved this soup at our Thanksgiving dinner. I don't know if I was the only one that encountered this, but I think that next time, I will not add as many shrimp. I increased the recipe for 12, and the 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp was just a little too much for the pureed soup. But the leftovers are great!!

Made this bisque for Thanksgiving. Subsituted Butternut squash for the pumpkin. I also skipped the sage as garnish. I felt the soup stood well on its own with its wonderful blend of shrimp and squash.Hint: Make sure to puree the squash before adding it to the soup! Great, great soup!!

The best soup I've ever made. Even the leftovers were delicious. A definite keeper.

Perfect. This soup blew a lot of people away. The stock recipe alone is a winner. To make the pumpkin soup after that is just a couple of easy steps that could be changed to go in a lot of different directions.
