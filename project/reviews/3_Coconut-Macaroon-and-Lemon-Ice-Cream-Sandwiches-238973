Exceptional flavors with a problematic recipe! How to get both the ice cream and the cookie more solid?

This was loved by my guests and daughter. The ice cream was difficult to work with and I had to do one sandwich at a time and then refreeze the ice cream. Was worth the effort.

Creamy, lemony ice cream and coconut macaroons! These are heavenly. The ice cream set up prefectly, I let it cure overnight and made the macaroons the next day.

I am still waiting fot the ice cream to set up....it's very running and I've made ice cream before....The lemon juice may be the problem, although it's necessary for the flavor. Also, the recipe does not lend itself to 3 in. macaroons, using a tablespoon of mixture if there is to be any substance to the sandwich. I will try again tomorrow.
