I made this recipe for friends and everyone loved it. Not easy, but worth it. Very tasty and looked great. The multi colored layers are from different colored tomatoes. I used heirlooms from a farmers' market and they were great.

Double gelatin and don't weight other pan on top.

The picture looks great - but what makes the yellow and green layers? Maybe the tomatoes of different colors?

Fabulous. I read the reviews for the other tomato terrine from 2008 and doubled the amount of gelatin. No problem with spilling from weights and it held together during the dinner. Lots of work, but worth the effort.

Fabulous. After reading another tomato terrine recipe on Epicurious, I doubled the amount of gelatin and did not have any problems with spilling and it held up very well. Green zebra tomatoes did not hold up well to filet etc as compared with red/orange. Lots of work, but beautiful results.

I was nervous making such a labor-intensive tomato side dish with gelatin but received rave reviews. After reading another tomato terrine on Epicurious, I doubled the amount of gelatin, did not have any problems with spill over and it held together very well. I found green zebra tomatoes did not perform well with filet etc and orange/red were best. Good news, everyone LOVED it. I

This is an elegant, great tasting recipe, although it takes a bit of effort. The only thing I would suggest is to press the tomato layers firmly while making it and NOT to weight the other loaf pan on top of the terrine at the end. A lot of my gelatin/stock liquid ended up on the cookie sheet. This made the terrine less "firm" and it fell apart some during serving. This has great flavor and is well worth the effort.
