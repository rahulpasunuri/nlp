I forgot to add that we added diced orange pepper. Delicious!

We loved this recipe. The last time we made lemon couscous, it was a disgusting disaster. So we were hesitant to add lemon this time. For that reason, we only used the lemon peel and very little fresh lemon juice. I will say that I didn't taste a distinct lemon flavor, but it was fantastic. We make couscous all the time and this was an easy, delicious way to season it!

My family really liked this as a side dish for a simple pan fried fish. Would be great as a cold salad too with the addition of chicken or shrimp. I added a little more salt and about twice the lemon juice!

This has all the right ingredients and characteristics for us: garlic, lemon, cilantro and quick and easy. I took everyone's suggestion and used vegetable broth instead of the water, but other than that followed the recipe to the letter. To make this even better, it could possibly be enhanced with some sauteed onion in addition to the garlic. Regardless, this was a very nice accompaniment to grilled portobello mushrooms, bell peppers and red onions.

Very good and easy! I think more cilantro would be nice. I added some preserved lemons, which took it from good to fabulous.

I used the Rice Select Pearl Toasted Israeli couscous. It took on the golden color of the turmeric. I followed the recipe exactly and it worked perfectly. I made it early in the day and let it sit in the pan. Next time I would reheat in the micro, I used the pan and it stuck to the bottom and a lot was wasted. I loved the texture.

This dish can also be made with quinoa that adds a nutty flavor.

Best couscous I've ever made. I used the chicken broth as suggested.

Good flavor, although it certainly needed the course salt. I added some shrimp and vegetables and made it a whole meal.

I made this recipe tonight by leaving out the lemon peel and replacing the water with chicken stock. To finish, a bit extra cilantro than was called for, maybe an additional 50%. I'm not normally a fan of couscous due to the texture of the dishes I've tried, but this had lots of great moisture and just the right amount of lemon and cilantro combined.

I really liked this dish though when I make it again, I will not put as much lemon in. I followed the recipe exactly, but it was a bit too lemony. Apart from that, it was great.

My husband often dislikes "lemon" flavored dishes, but this one was great with the Moroccan Beef Meatball Tagine. Definitely a keeper to accompany it again as well as for other dishes that need a good couscous side that marries well with cilantro.

This is a very good recipe. Perfect with the tagine I made. Lemon was not overpowering. Would add more cilantro. As others suggested, next time I will try it with chicken broth.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and the only change I might make would be to use chicken broth instead of water. It was pretty lemony, but I think using chicken broth might counter that. I definitely plan to make this again; I think it would go well with pretty much everything. The flavor isn't overpowering, so it could probably even go well with a white fish.

Very easy and tasty. Added extra lemon peel and cilantro. Great side dish for any protein.

I didn't find this too lemony, but it sure did need lots of salt at the end. Wish I'd remembered to make it with chicken broth as a previous reviewer suggested.

Like some other reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of water. I also added some chopped walnuts and chopped dates to counter the lemon. It was a big hit at my house.

I added Parmesan cheese and loved the recipe. I made it for a dinner party and it was easy to make and a big hit.

The turmeric gives it a nice color contrast with the cilantro and the lemon adds a nice flavor.

The lemon flavor overpowered the entire dish, I definitely wouldn't make this again.

I love couscous and just recently tried it! My husband doesn't love it as much as the kids and I but it is so healthy! I will keep working on this and I am also wanting to try Kamut Khorasan wheat since I have heard how awesome and healthy it is! Thanks for the recipe :)

Just made this dish for my husband. He says "gross!" the lemon is very overpowering. Super lemony. The aftertaste is pretty good, but the initial shock of the lemon is a little too much for my taste. And I love lemon. I think it would probably be good with half or even a fourth as much with chicken stock instead of water and double the garlic. I will try that next time possibly.

Since we love garlic, I used twice as much and broth instead of water. The salt from the broth was enough so I didn't add what the recipe called for. I also added a handful of pine nuts with the lemon juice and cilantro. It was a beautiful and tasty dish!

This recipe was yellow and yummy. Lemon flavor was strong, but in a good way. We enjoyed it with beef stew.

Doubled the garlic, used chicken stock and whole wheat cous-cous. Tossed with some chickpeas to make a meat-less entree. We loved it!
