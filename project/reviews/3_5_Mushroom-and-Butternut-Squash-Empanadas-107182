This is exceptionally delicious. I followed the recipe very closely to see how it would turn out and it was perfect. The filling was satisfying and complex, the crust flaky and savory.The spicy tomatillo sauce completed it. It took some effort though and I will probably only make it again for special occasions.

Great! Actually used canned mushrooms 'cus of limited time and it was still great. Used the Empanada Dough recipe from Gormet Oct 2004 and was perfect. Think the squash I had was spaghetti squash as well!

Try using sweet potato instead of squash--more taste and less watery. Also, fresh poblanos are better than jalapenos when cooked. I made thin strips instead of chopping them. Hard to keep from eating the filling along the way.

A bit of work, but well worth it and very flexible, too. I've used sweet potato for the squash and poblanos for the jalapenos--and even mango salsa for the sauce. You can't ruin this one. It's all good, and the pastry is the best.

I didn't make the tomatillo salsa here, as I'd made a big batch from another recipe and was trying to use up the leftovers, so my review excludes that. The pastry was delicious and flaky, etc, but I thought the filling was pretty . . .meh. I think it would be a lot more flavorful if the mushrooms were cooked on their own to brown them, and not just "boiled" as a mush. If one did that, I think you could even leave out the stock to no ill effect.

The recipe is good but, please, who does your editing? The word is empanada. No dash over the n is needed. The word empañada has a different meaning. You could use it for describing something that is fogged up or tarnish or such. Thees delicious pies are EMPANADAS. Not empañadas.

This is an impressive, highly flavorful dish. I must admit that I had to improvise a great deal to put it together, but I would make these again any day, and look forward to following the recipe exactly to taste what we might have missed. Like others, I could not find the pasilla de Oaxaca, and our local latin grocery had sold out of the unsmoked pasilla the day before we shopped. I used a different dried chile--the package read "Chile de California Entero". Sometimes you have to take what you can get. I don't think the sauce suffered, however. We both struggled to NOT lick the plate. I also didn't use the pastry dough recipe, but plan to next time. I used frozen pastry dough instead and baked the empanadas on a baking stone, which I highly recommend. Instead of the suggested mushroom varieties, I used baby portobellos. What is not to love about a portobello?? Even without making the pastry dough myself, the prep/cooking time is pretty extensive, so take advantage of every step you can do in advance if at all possible. I know I will.

These empanadas ROCK! I made them for my superbowl party and everyone loved them. Note that pasilla de Oaxaca is impossible to find. I ended up using chipotle, which made a very complex and flavorful sauce. I used portabellos and, like the other reviewer, drained them rather than trying to cook the liquid down to nothing. I made the dough the night before and kept it in the refrigerator for over 6 hours with no change in color or adverse effect. Labor intensive but worth it!

Great dough! Very easy to make and a great recipe to have in your repetoire. The filling is a little on the bland side and should be tasted and seasoned according to your preference. Otherwise, loved by friends and family.

This recipe has poential and is a noble effort but I found the filling rather bland.I added cumin,fresh cilantro and a pinch of cinnamon for an authnetic mexican flavor.I have a very small kitchen but the dough is easy to prepare.I did not make the sauce as any kind of exotic chilis,dried or otherwise are unable where I live.I made a fresh pineapple salsa insead which was great.But really with all the garlic and jalapeno you'd think there would be more flavor.If a person has enough room to use pre-made store bought dough they can make this dough from scratch.If you own a pastry cutting gadget it helps.

I give this recipe 4 forks for the fact that I received rave reviews from all who ate them. Best thing is that I made the empanadas a week before & froze them. They are a wonderful make-ahead dish!

Yummy! Well worth the time and effort. The filling was tasty (as called for and with chicken added) and the pastry was excellent!!! I used the left over pastry dough to make the piled high peach pie for dessert(found on this site and also worth a try), and it worked wonderfully. I will be making both again in the near future.

this recipe is delicious, lots of compliments. i used trumpet and protabello mushrooms (because they were cheaper) and i substituted the oaxaca with chipotle peppers (the closest thing i could find). the sauce turned out hotter than i expected, but it was also delicious. i made triple quantity and it was quite labor intensive (took about 4 hours total to make). i wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and chilled it overnight, longer than the recommended 6 hours, and it was just fine.

I CHEATED!! Despite all the wonderful reviews of the pastry, I have a small kitchen that does not lend itself to making pastries. I used canned crescent dough (GASP!!). The recipe took FOREVER only because it was the first time I made it. Next time will be easier since I will be familiar with the ingredients. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! My husband always whines when I make spicy dishes, so I left the chili out of the tomatilla salsa. I did include the peppers in the empanadas and it was PERFECT! I used regular white mushrooms and would like to try this with something stronger like crimini or portobellas!! A keeper!

Overall, I enjoyed putting the effort into this recipe, but it is definitely a project.(A one-timer, for me.) I had no idea how expensive the mushrooms were ($45/lb for chanterelles, $25/lb for hedgehogs), so I ended up subbing baby portabellos ($6/lb). If you use portabellos, at the stage when it says to cook til liquid evaporates, just drain them, b/c they will keep releasing liquid. My filling ended up w/ a very high mushroom to squash ratio, but people seemed to enjoy them, and like the crust. The sauce was all right, but not very spicy at all. And don't forget, like I did, to wear gloves for the jalepenos--my hands tingled all night!

I used a different filling, but I wanted to let everyone know this Cafe Azul pastry crust is THE BEST! My Nicaraguan husband says it's more authentic than the biscuit-like crust from most other recipes. It tastes like a cross between pie crust and croissants. I will be experimenting with this pastry dough in quiches, pastry and everything else.

Liked it, but did not love it! Will try again as I couldn't find the chiles (new to living in San Diego and went to 3 stores before I could find even canned chipotles (ick), much less the oxaca peppers. If anyone in the area can let me know of a good place to shop for dried peppers I would appreciate it!)The dough is really good and versatile however....

I made this for my Book Club and many are vegetarians or wanna-be vegetarians. We read an Isabel Allende book and since she is originally form Chile and empanadas are a Chilean favorite, it fit right in. The next time I make it I am thinking about adding a bit of sage, which goes so well with butternut squash. Do any of you more experienced cooks have any input for me on that? Also, if you have the good fortune to have one of the chain health food grocery stores like Wild Oats, Whole Foods, PCC or similiar in your area, check the bulk food section for vegetatian chicken broth powder. Sounds weird, but it tastes just fine and has a multitude of uses (makes plain old white rice taste really good!). They may even sell it packaged in the spice or soup section.

I didn't really enjoy and won't be cooking it again. Being a vegetarian I substituted the chicken stock for vegetable stock. By the way I would be horrified to find out a friend put meat stock into a dish they said was vegetarian. I guess going by the "don't ask, don't tell" rule - I am going to start questioning all my friend just in cause they are that inconsiderate and thoughless.

I made this for a community pot luck and they were a big hit. I could not find the chili's that were called for, so had to use chipoltles instead. Results were great. The crust was flaky and tender. The combination of squash and mushrooms was perfect fall finger food. They kept very well, and the flavors were even better on day two (I kept a few for myself...SO TASTY). Enjoy!

I will pay more attention to how hot my jalapenos are, but other than a little too much heat for us, these were excellent both hot and room temperature the next day. I didn't refridgerate them. I agree with Stephen about the rest. I don't think that broth is even necessary in the filling - the ingredients are plenty tasty without it. I used crimini mushrooms because they are reasonbly priced here, but porcini would give a meatier taste. I also used a regular pasilla chili because I've never tasted the sauce with the smoked chili, I won't know the exact difference.

Rating: 3
If porcini are too hard to come by or too spendy, a nice alternative is to purchase some porcini powder, dissolve in a broth that is appropriate to you, and mix the result in to some more easily-located mushrooms. The flavor is enhanced without the bank being broken. (PS it seems the recipes on Epicurious Recipe Flash have FAR more squabbling than any of the others - do you suppose that's a selection feature for the webmaster?)

These are just wonderful. The filling is very tasty - a really good combination of fall flavors. The sauce was lovely and a good reason to use my recent purchase of chili pasillo, but I also enjoyed them without it. The pastry is just fabulous. I still have half frozen and am going to make this my standard empanada dough. I have not read all the comments to understand the vegan debate. But I am confused as to why this recipe has not shown up in the database until my e-mail tonight from Epicurious (10/17), yet others have been able to comment on it since 10/08.

NY: I am a carnivore through and through but that is extremly rude and I hope your vegetarian friends find out what you've done and never come over for dinner again. Anna and cook from 10/16, you are just perpetuating this being a "chat" fest instead of recipe review with your comments, so take your own advice!

I suggest a chat room for people who like to debate the details of true ethnic cooking and veganism vs vegetarianism, create banal jokes about the recipe for boiling salted water and make asinine remarks much like the one I am currently entering. Ratings should be ratings and rantings should be rantings. Lets start a chatroom for stuff like this and stop bugging everyone who wants actual legitimate information about a RECIPE.

I read all of the reviews and was curious if anyone has made this yet? I don't care about the Vegan VS. Carnivore. I just want to know if it is any good!!!

Hey NYC, you are just plain wrong to do that to a vegetarian friend. what kind of friend are you? Would you apply the same rule to one who was allergic to nuts? If you know your friends are vegetarian, it is just wrong to serve them something w/ a meat product and try to mislead. Omitting the truth is the same as lying. And I am NOT a vegetarian, but have served dinners to vegans and meat eaters at the same meal and felt it was my obligation as cook and host to not even use the same wooden spoon when stirring the veg. dish and the meat dish. Hey, NY is a tough town, I live here too, but that is just immoral!

Stop picking these things apart. Try them and like them, or don't like them. It's a "recipe." If your a cook, you'll do what you will with it. Why complain? Make additions, make subtractions. TASTE IT.CHANGE IT. Enjoy it the way it is. Come on. You enjoy cooking and or eating don't you?? Isn't that what this site is really all about? I haven't tried this recipe, yet, but just once I'd like to see a "real" review.Taste,Texture, appearance...............Not a pick it apart column.

I live where there is little food variety; even my local stores carry vegetable stock and/or bullion. Both canned and dried variety. Although I'd probably sub mushroom broth also. A good cook knows how to improvise.

Well jeez Louise, how hard is it to substitue mushroom broth for chicken broth? I have several vegetarian friends, and this is the type of recipe I'd look for to serve at a dinner party.

I was very disappointed to see this headlined as a vegetarian appetizer and then to see chicken stock listed as an ingredient.
