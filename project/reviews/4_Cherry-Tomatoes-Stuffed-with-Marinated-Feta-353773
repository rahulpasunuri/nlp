A spoon didn't scoop the inner membrane of the tomato and they got mangled and the feta crumbled too much when cut so I used a paring knife to hollow the tomatoes then crumbled the feta into the herbs and oil. A big chunk of Kalamata tasted too strong to me so I chopped them and also mixed them in. Mounding the mixture evenly into the tomato with a teaspoon kept them from flipping. Doing it this way, I think it may have been prettier with a different olive but they tasted good and my friends ate them up.

Always a hit. I do without the salt though, plus I add a couple of teaspoons Balsamic vinegar to the marinade like someone else posted. I like to go 3:1 oil to vinegar.

Delicious--everyone asked for this recipe. I could only find the teeny tiny cherry tomatoes, so I cut them up and added them to the mixture before serving it with baguette toasts instead of stuffing them with the cheese mixture.

These were awesome and EASY... added some red chile to the marinade to give them a little zing. Maybe next time some lemon zest too. Cherry tomatoes are ridiculously expensive right now so I only bought one bag but that left lots of hunks of cheese left over for snacking. We sopped the left over marinade with pita bread and fought over the spoon!

Easy to make. Travels well (I used toothpicks, which I would do again even if not traveling). Nice presentation. It received a few compliments, but was definitely not a hit. I would make again only out of convenience.

This was an easy and pretty appetizer. I cut a small slice off the bottom and had no problem with them rolling. I'm making them again tonight.

A very classy appetizer along with being delicious and wholesome. Very impressive. Everyone loves them, my third time making them.

Great finger-food appetizer. I wish I'd let the feta marinate for a bit before stuffing it into the tomatoes. Used sheep feta, which dialed back on the salt.

I've made this 4-5 times now and it's always a hit. So yummy! And the beans on the plate trick works every time.

I substituted blue cheese and left out the olives and it was still delicious!

I don't like plain old tomatoes at all - I'll eat them in a salsa, ketchup, sauce, pizza, etc. but to just eat a tomato, can't do it. This changed when I made this recipe for a party. WOW! They were delicious.

I made this for a dinner party I was attending. Instead of cutting the feta into blocks I used crumbled feta. I also substituted the Kalamata olives for plain black olives. It was so easy. I used campari tomatoes which are the perfect size for an appetizer. I made them a couple hours ahead of time and they even sustained the hour ride to my destination. They were a HUGE hit. Everyone loved them and was asking how to make them. I will definitely be making these again. DELICIOUS!

These were great, can't stop popping into my mouth. I used cocktail tomatoes, a little larger than cherry and worked out great

Use good feta! Tasted great.

Loved it. Couldn't stuff cherry tomatoes (they weren't big enough) so I cut them in quarters, seeded them and added them to the much smaller diced feta;quartered the olives as well. I used dried oregano (half as much as fresh), and since I didn't have shallots, I used minced yellow onion.

I haven't tried this yet, but if you chill tomatoes they will lose much of their flavor. But it sounds delicious and will give it go when the tomatoes ripen. YUM!

Oh my goodness, this is delicious! As per other reviews, I did not add the extra salt, but was generous with fresh ground pepper. Hard to not keep sampling when making! This would be an appropriate appetizer for many occasions; I am sure I will be making again.

Made them last night for a crowd of seasoned Mediterranean palates--huge hit. I did not think any salt would be needed as feta is pretty salty and was right. Will make them again but next time will make more as they were gobbled up so quickly.

This was excellent. Just a couple of notes on making it. If you cut the tomatoes crosswise, as instructed and not top to bottom, it keeps them from rolling over. If you need greater stability to transport them, either follow some of the suggestions here or what I did was pack a 9x13 dish full of these...I used about 20 oz of tomoatoes and scaled the recipe accordingly. By the dish being full there was no way anything was moving. I rather make more than add more steps to a tedious recipe (though well worth it!!). Also, I cut the feta 1/4 in x 1/2 in rectangles which seemed to fit better with olive in the tomato. Also, kept a nice balance of flavor. Lastly, no added salt is needed here with saltiness of the feta and olives. Enjoy!

Going to make them this evening... Might go with Basil tho. Regarding how to stand them up, I saw once a serving tray lined with dried beans, lentils or rice to use as a "sand" to hold deviled eggs in place.

If you put just a tiny amnt of seasoned cream cheese on the bottom of the tomato it will stick upright and not fall over or roll around

We loved these, great bar snack on poker night.

Morluv from Ramona - I like your suggestions. Also could be done with fresh basil, mozz. and balsamic for a more traditional Italian take. Now there's 3 yummy ways to do this dish!

Actually - this is fairly salty even for me. I'm glad I pre-tested it. When I make it for my party next week I will use only 1/4 of an olive and not add any salt at all to either the tomatoes or the feta. Otherwise, this is an excellent recipe.

Haven't tried this yet, but two things I'd alter: 1) Use toothpicks to make serving easier, which will also stabilize them (if you insert the toothpick at an angle). 2) Why not grill or bake the tomatoes a little to heat the inside and get a little melt on the cheese? Seems like a tastier way to do it. Anyone tried either of those things? Good ideas? Oh, also, might sub mozzarella and basil for feta and oregano...

I hate it when cooks transform the original recipe so much it doesn't resemble itself any more...but here goes... :) How about puree about 1/4 C Italian parsley in the mini processor, then add the olives, puree briefly. Then add about 1/2 C goats cheese and a tiny bit more oregano with a grind of pepper...and throw in the feta cheese, mixing in by hand, at the end. This would make filling the tomatoes so much easier. Then I would very lightly drizzle with a good, aged balsamic vinegar in place of the olive oil. What do you think?

Big taste, big hit at girl's night out party. The recipe is easy, though not super quick. A bit fiddly but worth it.

easy,taste sensation. It was the hit of a small dinner party. Cant wait to make it again

To stabilize,use a sharp serrated knife to slice off a thin piece off the bottom of the tomato to make level. A bit time consuming but necessary to stop the rollling action

I have't made these yet, but they look good. My question to anyone who's made them already is how do they stand upright on the plate? It seems they would just roll all over the plate. Any thoughts?
