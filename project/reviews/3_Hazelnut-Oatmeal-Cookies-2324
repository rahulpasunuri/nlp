Got Milk? Because you'll need it. The orange redeems this dry cookie, though it really can't make you want a second one.

I found these cookies very dry and crumbly.

Easy to make and excellent. The orange flavor was a nice touch, but I recommend toasting the hazelnuts. To have thicker cookies with a crispy edge, bake as directed (rolling dough in to balls). For a thinner, crispier cookie, just drop by tablespoon.
