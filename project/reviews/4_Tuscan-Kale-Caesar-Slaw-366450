Love love this recipe! I did less anchovies so it was not that salty! Was just an amazing salad and the egg was such an interesting way to do it. Also, I added grilled chicken to it. This is going to be a regular salad I make. Fabulous way to enjoy Kale

Best kale caesar salad ever! I make it all the time, as is, recipe is perfect!

This was delicious! I substituted some rinsed and drained capers for the anchovy and let the greens rest in the dressing for an hour before serving. It was so good that just 3 of us ate the whole thing! Will definately make again-SOON!

I agree it was salty, but still thought it was excellent. I made parmesan crisps in the over instead of sprinkling w/parmesan. Yum!

Way, way too salty with 1/2 c.Parmasan cheese (I used the good stuff) and the anchovies. I prepared it for an after a concert supper just for famiy and one friend. adding sauteed scallops, as a test for an impending pot luck supper offering. Thank heavens I tried it. We ate the scallops and threw the rest away. It was that salty.

I've been making this salad for at least a year now and it never fails to please - can't wait for our local farmers' market to bring on the kale! The nuisance of removing centre stalks is well worth the result. I don't know how many times I've passed on the recipe but, like others, I settle for no more than 1/2 cup of oil and add more grated egg. I have also added extra garlic and tossed in sliced black olives and red pepper flakes.

I admit I resisted kale for a long time, assuming it was a fad in the vein of oat bran. But then I had a delicious citrus-y kale salad at Silver restaurant in Park City, Utah and became a convert. I was looking for something similar to make at home and this was just as good. I like salt, so it wasn't too salty for me. If it is for you, use fewer anchovies.

Fantastic easy recipe! I used baby kale and 2 eggs. Delish!! Loved the technique of putting the egg through a strainer. A keeper for sure.

The dressing is a little salty. With the amount of cheese and anchovies, it can be a bit much. But you can dress the salad a little more on the light side because the flavor is so savory and rich. We don't use Tuscan kale that much in our house for salad - it's too much work, as it's pretty stringy unless you take out the center spine of each leaf of kale. Instead, a great substitute is baby kale which you can get in the gourmet lettuce refrigerator section that comes in the plastic clamshells. Very tender and still very kalelike. The use of the strainer to press the egg white is pure genius. It's an amazing texture which is like light-as-air ricotta, a perfect counterpoint to the more textured garlicy lettuce.

First time using Tuscan kale (or as the girl I bought it from at the farmer's market called it, "Dragon kale" which I assume is the same thing) and first time eating any kale raw. I did not like this salad. It was pretty boring, the kale was too tough, and the dressing was too salty. Pressing the egg through the mesh strainer was interesting and easier than I expected. It's a lot faster and easier than grating it with a fine grater (which I have done in the past to get a similar texture). Overall, however, I was disappointed with the results and don't understand how come this recipe is so overrated. My mother and husband thought it was bitter. Aside from my brother, who will eat anything, I was the only one who had a good-sized helping (not because I was particularly fond of it but because I want to eat my kale). Will not make again, it's a terrible use for a perfectly fine vegetable.

This was waaaay too salty/anchov-y for our tastes. I used regular kale from the farmer's market, and I liked the egg on top (I used 2 so it would be more filling), but I think one anchovy would have been enough. I like the idea of kale and a caesar dressing, but this just didn't work for us.

I have made this salad endlessly. We keep kale sliced and washed, shredded hard boiled eggs and the salad dressing separate and it's always available. (Kale is so durable. Sliced, it lasts over a week.) While no changes are necessary, I made a few discoveries tonight & wanted to share. I didn't have any anchovy on hand so I used some fish sauce. It too gives an umami presence and worked great! To the dressing, I also added a nice chunk of feta and an egg yolk. Lovely flavor. As written, or slightly adapted, this is a terrific recipe and a wonderful staple in our house.

Wonderful recipe! Having recently read how good kale is for us, I have been trying to incorporate it into my meal plans. This recipe has far exceeded all other kale preparations I've tried so far. My three-year-old even eats the heck out of it which surprised me. I followed the recipe directions exactly. Wouldn't change a thing!

I am a little obsessed with kale, and probably would never rate ANY kale salad poorly. With that said, I love this recipe! I modified it a bit as I don't eat fish. A tablespoon of soy sauce (as another reviewer suggested) provided a nice, salty alternative. And 1/2 c. olive oil is plenty. My husband asks for this salad regularly!

Kale has been a staple in my house for years, usually sauteed with onion and garlic as a side with Fish in the Winter but now this is my summer go-to salad for dinners or pot lucks. Absolutely love this salad.

Always looking to increase our dark greens and seeing kale (curly) on "bonus buy" and so nice I happened on this Caesar slaw. Even the "take it or leave it" kale eaters took seconds. A great way to add some healthy greens and really easy. I followed the 1/2 cup oil suggestion and am looking forward to having it again...soon!

Great recipe. Like others, I just coarsely chopped the egg - much easier. I also increased the number of eggs and ate this as a lunch salad (instead of as a side dish).

I made a variant without the egg and with Manchego instead of Parmesan. It worked nicely. Only problem was the amount of oil. When I had dressed it enough to get the desired flavor, it was too oily. I should have followed the suggestions to cut back to 1/2 cup.

I used 1/2 cup of olive oil for dressing and good grade dijon mustard Only had regular kale, so I did 1/2 kale and half swiss chard. Pulled all stalks out. Chop up to bite size. This is my favorite recipe EVER!

I've never made my own Caesar dressing before trying this recipe. I substituted soy sauce for anchovies which worked surprisingly well, I thought. I agree with other posters on the thought that 3/4 c of oil is a bit much - I definitely had left over dressing. The sieved egg technique was also a first for me. Needless to say this was a much more labor intensive dish than a salad normally is for me, but it tasted great and was well liked by my dinner guests.

I love kale and wanted to make this but was disappointed by the huge amount of olive oil necessary. I came across a Kale Caesar recipe from the LA Times that has MUCH less oil and a TON of flavor. It's my new addiction. If you want a more healthful alternative, Google the LA Times recipe and you'll be thrilled.

Made with regular curly Kale (couldn't find Lacinato). Also, my experience with the quest to find the perfect Caesar dressing recipe has brought me to the realization that 100% olive oil can end up tasting too bitter, so I used half good quality olive oil and half vegetable oil. It was very good, but I think I'd just dice the egg for next time -- the sieve step was time consuming and messy.

This was awesome! Made as instructed and everyone (little kids and adults) loved it!

I found this recipe while looking for something healthy to serve at Thanksgiving. People loved it! Definitely use the "other kind" of kale, the stuff that isn't as curly. I used both, but only 1/3 of the curly kind. I made a second batch today and will keep it on the regular rotation.

Wonderful. Raw Caesar-like Tuscan kale salads are a dime a dozen lately, but I think this recipe is my favorite. It has a hearty appeal that I think you can count on extending to people who ordinarily dislike kale salads. The nuances of the dressing and the boiled egg really make it. I recommend using only 1/2 c., if that, of olive oil in the dressing. It needs no more and is surprisingly mild, yet deeply flavored and complex, with all those anchovies. Also, I tried and liked the egg-sieving trick (don't bother using two sieves as instructed!) but probably would just finely grate the egg next time, as the finished product looks very similar. Since I only had half a bunch (probably 5-6 c.) of kale around, I used only half the dressing  which was less dressing than the recipe as is produces, anyway, since I cut back on the oil.

I made this with only one anchovy (not my husband's favorite flavor and 8 seemed excessive anyway) and only 1/2 cup of olive oil. It was delicious! Now I sometimes make it with bottled caesar dressing and little extra lemon juice if I'm feeling lazy. Really tasty.

I made this recipe a couple nights ago. I had never made raw Kale salad before so I followed the recipe exactly. I was not delighted with the results. I found that there was way more dressing than required and the dressing was a little too strong in anchovies. Having said that the recipe had a lot of potential I would defs make it again but I might consider making a different caesar dressing next time.

I am really skeptical of raw kale salads, generally finding them to be blech--too raw! But I'm a caesar addict and try to mix up my leafy greens, so gave this a try. Delicious, and the presentation is absolutely beautiful. I think lacinato kale rather than curly kale is key, and you must aggressively get out those center stems. We dressed the salad about 10 mins before eating, rather than at the last second as we normally would, hoping this would help it wilt enough to taste less like rabbit food. Not sure if that made a difference, but it's great to know that you could make this a little bit in advance for company with no harm--you won't have a soggy mess on your hands.

Wow! This made me like kale! It was so good, my kids even ate it. Yes, really.

I followed this recipe to a tee, and my husband and I both loved it. The bitterness of the kale balanced perfectly with the oily tartness of the dressing. I don't like anchovies, but you couldn't even tell they were in the dressing. The eggs were a great touch to the presentation. I love that the salad is make-ahead; it is ideal for a quick and easy weeknight meal, but is equally wonderful for entertaining because of its fantastic flavor and beautiful appearance.

Used kale fresh from the garden, only 1/2 cup of oil and it was a huge hit. Dressed the kale about 4 hours before serving which I believe allowed the lemon juice to "cook" the kale somewhat. I only used 1 egg, but might use 2 next time. Divine way to stay healthy!

The bests raw kale recipe ever. It is my new Caesar Salad, especially since it included eggs but not raw eggs. Used two eggs, turned out perfect, can't stop eating it. Next time I'll try it with toasted pine nuts for some crunch.

I have now taken this slaw to several picnics this summer and I am always asked for the recipe. One time, even used bottled dressing - it is a hit, stands up to heat, lasts and lasts, and is SO good!

I know this might seem odd, but my friend recommended massaging kale if you find yourself with a bunch that seems tough to chew when raw. She puts hers in a bag with some lemon juice and then sort of rolls and mashes it around like you would making dough. Her kale salad was the hit of a potluck and that is her big secret.

Fabulous! Cavolo Nero is hard to find here, so I used regular, curly kale and as it's too tough and a little bitter raw, I tossed it in a few cups of boiling water, just turning it until it turned bright green, maybe one minute. Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe and loved it! Very tart with all the lemon, but nicely balanced all in all. Served as the perfect counterpoint to pulled pork sandwiches.

This was really quite delicious. I don't think I've ever used Kale raw before; I've always braised it or put it in soups. While this fresh-made Caesar dressing was scrumptious, I'll make this with bottled dressing if that's all I have around. The tart, salty Caesar is really a nice complement to the slightly bittter taste of the Kale.

Fantastic! Didn't bother sieving the eggs, just thinly sliced hardboiled eggs on top. Also used less olive oil. My husband's favorite salad!

Rating: 4
Amazing! I love kale but often find recipes lacking, especially recipes for raw kale preparations. I'm totally on board with this! I personally usually prefer my salad dressings closer to the 1/3 acid/oil ratio rather than the 1/4 ratio, so i went just a tiny bit lighter on the olive oil than what this called for, and it worked beautifully, so i might try again a touch lighter still. I could eat a huge bowl of this and not get tired of so much kale!

To echo what everyone else had said, this was a delicious salad! I was a little hesitant because kale is so strongly flavored, but the dressing manages to complement the strong flavor and actually mellow it out. We made it for dinner one night and the leftovers help up great for lunch the next day. The sieved eggs looked beautiful, and this is definitely a technique I'll borrow when I want to make a pretty caesar. An easy an delicious way to eat your healthy greens!

This was amazing. The last helping never made it into the fridge for leftovers as I intercepted it. I dressed the kale about an hour before serving, and it softened the kale just a touch, but still maintained a nice crunch. Also used two eggs, and perhaps a more generous helping of the parm, but otherwise, followed the recipe. My 7 year old loved it, too.

A wonderful summer salad! We topped it with grilled chicken- very satisfying. Used less olive oil and more anchovies- a definite repeat for our family!

This salad is really good. The lemon juice "cooks" the kale, (think ceviche) and takes the bitter taste out of it. I don't think you need to wait to dress this salad it's better the second day after it's had time to meld together.

This was a very good, very strongly flavored salad. The dressing has an assertive flavor and goes nicely with the strong flavor of the Tuscan kale. The recipe makes way more dressing than needed for the amount of kale listed, but it keeps for a few days. I was planning to use the rest of the dressing on romaine for a more traditional Caesar salad, but found the flavor a bit too strong for the milder greens. Next time I'll buy more of the Tuscan kale.

This was simple and really delicious. I made as written except I skipped hard boiled egg and added sunny-side up egg since I was eating it myself for dinner. The dressing is terrific and pairs extremely well with the kale. I had lots of dressing left over which I can't wait to use on the remaining kale this evening and on other things. Will definitely make over and over again this summer.

Simple,easy and great tasting recipe.Love the anchovies in the dressing. Using the sieve to powder the egg white and yolk is new to me and made the dish look beautiful. This is great way to use kale- did not have dinosaur( tuscan) kale so used regular. Will be making this one again.

I made this for a bbq this weekend and it was a hit. Very easy to make & a good, healthy alternative to the typical pasta & potato-based side dishes. It's an unusual take on the classic Caesar with all the great vitamins from the kale. I plan to make it again tomorrow!

I could not get enough of this salad. It's a great twist on the classic Caesar. The recipe makes a lot of dressing -- we've been adding it to other greens throughout the week. A great way to use the kale from our CSA. I will absolutely make this recipe again.
