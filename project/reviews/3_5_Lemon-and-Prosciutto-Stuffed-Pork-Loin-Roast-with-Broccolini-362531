I made this tonight for Christmas Eve dinner and it was delicious. I used a meyer lemon, sliced paper-thin, and I thought it was just the perfect amount of tang. I also did a Brussels sprout side dish instead of broccolini. I was cooking at a friend's house, and their roasting pan didn't function on their induction stovetop, so the sauce wasn't as flavorful as it could have been, but that was due more to my equipment than the recipe, I think. I look forward to making this again.

I have cooked a fair amount of roasts and this one just isn't that good. Maybe it was the lemon, but I didn't care for the flavor.

I almost feel like I must have done something wrong because I thought this recipe was kind of boring! I should have read the reviews first, I would definitely cut off the peel or zest it instead of just putting the slices in, but even with that, it definitely didn't have a flavor explosion like I was expecting. Overall, it was edible, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Fantastic recipe. We loved it! I think they key to the subtle lemon flavor is to cut it as thinly as possible. I used my mandoline and it was perfect. The sauce is amazing and a delightful addition to the meal.

I was very pleased with this recipe. We have a meyer lemon tree and sliced it very thinly with a mandoline and it added just the right amount of tang to the dish. I did add some minced garlic to the stuffing but other than that followed the recipe. I was disappointed with the crust on the roast and next time plan to sear the outside of the meat on top of the stove before putting the meat into the oven. The sauce was great and just the right consistency. We did not use broccolini because I hate it. Instead we served it with sauteed vegetable mix of asparagus and leeks as a 2nd course of an italian dinner. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

I am not sure why this isn't getting better reviews. I made it as written and I though it was superb. The lemon slices have to be extremely thin, as written in the recipe. This way, they break down and become almost caramelized. I could really taste the prosciutto, too, and the salt was not overwhelming. The broccolini was fine, not spectacular. Served with garlic and herb wild rice, loved by adults and children.

Delicious - this was a nice combination of flavors and also looked impressive at my dinners party last night. After reading some reviews about the lemon being overpowering, I used a mandolin to slice the lemon extremely thinly. It worked well, but there were some bitter flavors from the pith. I might try just using a whole lot of lemon zest instead of the full slices next time. The broccolini was also delicious!

This was a very nice dinner for guests. However, a few people commented on how strong the lemon flavor was. Next time I'd probably put less lemon - perhaps not lemon slices but just some lemon gratings.

Delicious. First time cooking a pork roast and I loved it. I had the butcher butterfly it, and it was a bit uneven. But the filling was delicious, cooked perfectly in the recommended time and everyone loved it. I was glad I read the reviews beforehand - Trader Joe's happened to have Meyer lemons and using one helped mitigate what others mentioned about the lemon being overpowering. Can't wait to make this again

Made this for New Years dinner. It was delicious! The lemon was done paper thin and added a nice burst of flavor to the dish. I did by mistake put salt on the loin before rolling - big mistake - a tad to salty for me with the ham already salt. Oops. I would make this again!!

Agree with a few others that the lemon overpowers the flavors of the meat. It is nice initially, but it gets old after a while. I sliced the lemon very thing and removed some of the rind. I would make a similar dish, but either tone down the fruit or omit it altogether.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner this year and it was a big hit. The key was slicing the lemon paper thin either by hand or mandoline and I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the filling which boosted the flavor enormously. I would definitely make this again! It was delicious and easy.

This was the big hit for our Christmas dinner. After reading the reviews, I removed and discarded the peel before thinly slicing the lemons. We didn't have chives available, so I sprinkled the stuffing with Tuscan Sunset Italian seasoning from Penzeys. Before putting the roast in the oven at 350, I seared it in a hot skillet until brown on all sides.

I was very disappointed with this. The lemon was bitter. And overall, there was no outstanding flavor with this pork dish. The are so many other great recipes for pork on this site...this isn't it. For those who liked....i would recommend taking out of oven. At 138F rather than 145F...it turns to overdone sow quickly

Amazing flavor! I sliced a whole lemon w/ a ceramic blade slicer and it basically melted in your mouth when eating the roast - the flavor was not overpowering. I thought the gravy was pretty lemony but it was fine w/ the pork. On its own it was a bit much. I had no problems at all w/ the recipe and will make it again.

This was very good. Agreed that the lemon is a bit much. I sliced it very thin (2-3mm). I think this helped, plus I love lemon so I thought the flavor was great. If you don't LOVE lemon, halve the lemon amount or peel the lemon ridding the zest and decreasing the lemon flavor. Loved the panko in it. Was amazingly moist.

The lemon peel was overpowering but everything else was excellent. We are serving this for Christmas but we will likely either use Meyer lemons (if we can find them) or remove some of the peel before slicing the lemons. I think if they are cut VERY thinly it would taste fine.

My whole family loved this dish-- even four picky kids. I was leary of the lemon when I first read the recipe, so I made sure the slices were very thin and I didn't add the whole lemon. I think that's they key to avoid the problems the first two reviewers encountered. My one quibble: not enough gravy! When I make it again I will double the gravy amount.

Outstanding..very impressive....and Delicious. As far as the other review, too much lemon, after reading that, I just peed the lemons before slicing them. It was great.

I agree with the first reviewer. The lemon was very bitter and overpowering. We picked out the lemon and enjoyed it, but couldn't pick up the flavor of the prosciutto at all.

The lemon in this dish really overwhelms the other beautiful elements. The pork was wonderful, juicy and tender. I loved the way the panko kind of broke down to a bread stuffing consistency, but I could not get over the bitterness of the lemon. The prosciutto and chives were very neutral, their flavors did not stand up to the pork loin or the lemon. Additionally, the gravy recipe supplied did not work well for us. I could not get the mixture to reduce enough after 15 minutes and my end product still had sharp, acidic citrus notes from the wine. I think that the idea of the dish is very nice, I would just use a different flavor profile next time.
