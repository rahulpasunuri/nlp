Fast and easy, adds zing to roasted lamb as well as fish cakes.

Add horseradish to taste-- I used way less than 6 tablespoons! This has got to be a typo: I used about 1 teaspoon. I'm not sure the arugula adds anything, either taste-wise or color- wise. The sauce is a pretty green and complimented the herbed fishcakes well. I think it would also go nicely with salmon or salmon cakes.

I was wondering what others do with this sauce. I'm interested in suggestions. Thank you.
