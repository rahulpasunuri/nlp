This is the best! I have been making this base ever since it appeared in the magazine. I've also done the 3-mushroom dressing, port basted turkey and the wonderful gravy - all outstanding.

Excellent beginning for delicious turkey gravy especially if you're doing the Southern "deep fried turkey". Substituted 1 cup water for reserved mushroom liquid and 2/3 cup red wine for port. Seasoned to taste. Delish

Makes a very tasty gravy. I used it with Port-Based Roast Turkey with Pan Gravy and Three-Mushroom Dressing for a very nice Thanksgiving trio. Nice to be able to make ahead most of it.
