Loved the sauce but did not pair very well with eggplant. Found that the eggplant paired well with a BBQ sauce. Just happened to be grilling okra with the eggplant and noticed the grilled okra paired very nicely with the yogurt mint sauce. Added a little tumeric to the sauce, and it was awesome. Will make the sauce again and experiment with different grilled veggies.

Eggplant can be a hard vegetable to sell because of the texture. This is a great way to use up some garden fresh eggplant and really wow your friends. It's very simple and I thought it was delicious.

really into grilled eggplant at the mo and when i sat down to eat was afraid i'd just want it on its own, no sauce. but the yogurt sauce was really lovely (touched it up a bit with some garlic, salt, and a bit extra curry powder) and the leftovers made a great chicken salad dressing the next day. cut the eggplant into spears rather than rounds (easier to grill and like the presentation). yum :-)

Awesome! ANd the mint sauce goes with everything! I made it with three different kinds of eggplant- baby, purple and white striped and white. Delicious!

The eggplant was wonderful prepared in this manner, but the dip was WAYYYYYYYYY TOO spicy---no one could handle it, and we have some spice lovers in the crowd. Next time I'll just make a traditional, cool raita with this grilled eggplant

I found this dish great. I was serving a grilled curried chicken and had vegetarian guests. I served this as well as part of their main course and it went over well with everyone. I loved the taste of sesame oil with the eggplant.

I prepared the sauce a day ahead and also cracked the coriander seed. With no convenient place to put the cracked seed, I placed it into the oil and left it for a day - it really intensified the taste of the coriander in the final product.

The trick w/ grilling eggplant is slicing thin and sprinkling salt on top while it rests on papertowels. Each side for about 30min. Then it is not dry and incredible grilled!

Very strange this combination of sesame, yogurt and mint. That's why I had to try it. Unfortunately, it just remained strange. I thought the flavours didn't match. Come to think of it, I don't like eggplant anyway.

Sort of strange. Not exciting.

The yogurt sauce was fantastic, and enjoyed a revival as an addition to hot tomato soup the next day. Incredible! Eggplant turned out a bit dry on the indoor grill - will use more oil next time.

I've made this a couple times now and is a hit with my vegetarian friends as well as the meat eaters! Substituted a mixture of coriander powder and sesame seeds for the crushed coriander seed and was delicious.

The yogurt-mint sauce is great! Goes very well with grilled zucchini also. Don't forget coriander.

I made a different yogurt sauce for this recipe, but the eggplant itself was FANTASTIC! My husband was surprised at how buttery they were on the inside. I used 3 long thin Asian eggplants.

I used Chinese eggplant and was able to grill it on a little "foreman" grill very successfully. I omitted the coriander. The sauce is outstanding -- I recommend (for the less health-conscious) using full-cream yogurt, which makes the dish delightfully rich and creamy. I paired the eggplant with garlic-stuffed broiled trout and spiced basmati rice, a stellar combination.

Pretty good; the cool yogurt and hot curry powder (we used hot, anyway) provide an interesting contrast. Don't skimp on the sesame oil.

So good... the coriander seeds, sesame oil, and spicy yogurt sauce make this dish.

The yoyurt sauce was a big hit! I halved the red pepper and it still had plenty of kick for us.

The coriander seed is great on the eggplant. I was leary not being much of a fan of either. What a great combination. I also really liked the spicy kick in the yogurt-mint sauce. I used Japanese eggplant and the small disks looked so beautiful on the platter that I was thinking this could even be a tray passed appetizer for a cocktail party. It's fine at room temperature too.
