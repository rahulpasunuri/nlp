I prob bought the wrong puff pastry so they did not look exactly like in the picture. However, the taste was great. My fiancee and his younger brother love it. Quick and easy. I definitely will make them again.

The simplicity and beauty and deliciousness of this recipe cannot be overstated. If you want more individual portions, simply cut the recommended pastry size in half or double the recipe (or both = 4x as many desserts!). If you're even thinking about this one, just settle on it now.

There is nothing to say except that this is just fabulous. You want to lick the plate.

I have made this several times. It is a beautiful dessert and is very impressive in appearance though extremely easy to make. I used the zest of one lemon to the cream cheese mixture. In my opinion, it just needs this. I also used Trader Joe's blueberry preserves because that's what I had and it was just terrific. It is hard to eat without messing it up. Make it, you'll see...but it is very yummy and easy.

This was delicious and so easy! I didn't use quite all of the powdered sugar and the sweetness was just right, especially as I was serving it with a Navarro late harvest riesling. My guests loved it and I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

I made this recipe with just a few adjustments. When the pastry was cool, I heated a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips in a plastic bag in the micro - snipped off the corner and drizzled chocolate over the top of all the pastries (top and bottoms) and then I sprinkled with chopped almonds. As for the fruit - I used fresh blueberries, blackberries and sliced strawberries. I didn't toss them in the jelly sauce, but drizzled the sauce over the top and around the plate. It was just enough. This dessert was fantastic. The chocolate and almonds were a perfect addition. Highly recommend.

Simple and lovely. It's also easy to modify slightly for whatever is in season. As well as other berries, I've tried almond flavoring in the mousse, peaches for topping and sprinkled almonds on the top puff. Great!

Made this for a dinner party and they seemed to enjoy it. Hubby loved it. I used homemade raspberry/blackberry jam in the filling and a Tbsp of vanilla liqueur (Navan) in the whipped cream. If I make it again, I will add sugar to the whipped cream. It wasn't sweet enough for me.

Yum. I didn't have time for the puff pastry this time and used Girl Scout shortbread cookies. It was REALLY good!!

This is a recipe that I would definitely make again. My non-dessert eating husband couldn't resist it. It was great to prepare the three components ahead of time and then assemble them after dinner. I'm looking forward to trying this with other berries.

First time I made this I forgot to add the blackberry preserves. It was delicious anyway and much lower in calories and sweetness. Second time, I remembered the preserves, and oh my goodness it was heavenly.

This recipe was a huge success at a dinner party this past weekend. Absolutely love the cream cheese mousse - it would be great with any fresh berry. Will make it again, but as another reviered mentioned, would just let the pastry puff and only use it for the base layer.

Easy & delicious. My guests loved it. As another cook previously stated, you can do everything ahead and assemble at the last minute. I did find, however, that 2 containers of blackberries (instead of 3) was plenty for six people. The mousse was delicious for something so simple.

This was so easy, and a great make ahead dish. I made everything that morning and threw it together when needed.

Huge hit at a recent brunch. Nearly everyone slipped into the kitched for seconds. I didnt layer, I let the pastry puff, rather than flatten, and I poured berries over pastry and topped with mousse. Delicious!

A huge hit at my last dinner party -- very pretty presentation, easy to do ahead early in the day and put together at the last minute. I used raspberries & blackberries for extra color. Would definitely make again.
