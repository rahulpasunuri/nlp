First time I made these by the recipe, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of garlic flavor. So the second time I didn't strain out the garlic and added a bit of freshly grated Romano. Much better!

I haven't tried this one, but it might be interesting with fresh asparagus tips and freshly grated Asiago cheese. Hmmmm. I'll try it and let you know.

This little muffin size bread pudding was so pretty and appealing in appearance that one could overlook the fairly bland taste. Next time, I'll add more garlic and perhaps hot spices to pep it up.

Yum. Substituted chives for the parsley and everyone thought it was delicious.

I prepared this for Easter dinner for a big family and doubled it. We had this instead of bread, everyone enjoyed it.

A quiche-like texture. I added chopped green chile and omitted the parsley.
