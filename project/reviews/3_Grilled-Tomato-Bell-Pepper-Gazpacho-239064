Pretty tasty - I used a mixture of local and heirloom tomatoes and organic vegetables. I'm not sure the grilling added much in the long run - this step makes this recipe pretty time-consuming. The raw garlic makes it pretty potent - very enjoyable at home but def not a dish to bring and eat in the office at lunch! I added water for my 1 year old and he loved it (and he's fussy these days! ;) ).

I've made this gazpacho three times already since I received the Sept. issue. Its delicious! We even served it once as "gazpacho shots" appetizers with a little floater of vodka on top. Yum. I will admit its a pain with the grilling first and really messy with the peeling the squishy tomates. . .I'm wondering how it would turn out if you didn't grill first. Isn't a lot of the "smoky" flavor from the paprika?

There's nothing better than Gazpacho for a summer dinner! Recipe was delicious, fresh and flavorful. I used my immersion blender to puree -- worked like a charm.

Very tasty! I made it the first time according to the recipe. The next time I used half home grown tomatoes and half store-bought/boxed fire-roasted tomatoes. DELISH *and easy*

i just finished making this and i can't stop picking at it, it is delicious! I mostly followed it, but I am watching calories so just used an olive oil spray on the veggies before grilling and only added 1 T of olive oil later. I also used 2 sweet onions and left a fair amount of char on the tomatos before throwing them into the processor. don't skip the smoked paprika, that's what really makes this stand out.

I agree, very messy with the tomatos, but well worth it! I did add a lot of extra salt, and cayenne to spice it up a bit. But it was delicious, and served well not only as a great soup, but fresh salsa as well.

The muted grilled flavor was not worth the effort. As a professional cook of 28 years, this version, to me, was akin to gilding a lily.

I just made this for a cold soup party I have in the summers. It was a smash hit. However - I did triple the recipe and roasting the tomatoes was a huge mess -- peeling 10 pounds of mostly mushy tomatoes was not fun. Also - I used the broiler as I don't have a bar-be-que so that took much longer. I may make it again in a smaller quantity.
