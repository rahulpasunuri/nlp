Nice easy recipe. Used relatively lean pancetta and the fat rendered wasn't bad...can't imagine using bacon for this because it'd be a grease pool. You have to taste as you go and add extra spices if needed... I ended up adding extra italian dry spices and some chili flakes. I also added some mushrooms to make it more substantial. Remember to do the final adjustments after you put the pancetta back in so you don't oversalt it...

I loved this recipe! Some of my family members are vegan and so I left out the cream from the sauce and it still turned out great! The one thing that I didn't like was that the sauce was really acidic.... But I would definitely make this recipe again!

I've been making this for years, and it's wonderful. I usually use uncured bacon instead of pancetta. IMPORTANT: If your sauce is coming out watery, it's because you didn't allow it to reduce for long enough. It is not a problem with the recipe itself, and it's easy to fix. The cooking time in the recipe is way off. Go by the look and feel of the sauce, not your kitchen timer, and you will be very happy with this recipe.

Four forks for the outcome of the dish from the little preparation that's involved! I whipped this dish up last night with my boyfriend for the first time. He was pretty skeptical about the little amount of pancetta called for and was skeptical at the appearance of the sauce... until he tasted it! You really don't need more than this amount of pancetta, though we threw in just a few chicken meatballs from a previous meal. I followed someone else's advice and only put one can of diced tomatoes and crushed red pepper flakes (first with the garlic and then added more later) - it came out perfectly! Definitely going to make this regularly.

This recipe is awesome! We double the pancetta and add some grated parmigiano reggiano cheese. We also cut the tomato measurement in half and only use one can. Truly outstanding!

This has to be one of my favorite go-to recipes - I make it about once a week! Once I didn't have the pancetta on hand but did have turkey sausage, so I removed it from the casing, crumbled it and sauteed it, then added it to the sauce and it was equally fabulous! Adding a handful of freshly grated parmesan enhances the flavor too.

Excellent and fast family meal. I followed the recipe, but didn't have basil so I wilted some organic baby spinach along with the garlic step. Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes, but the kids loved it as is.

Great for a simple easy dinner for the family- Modifications: Used fresh chopped plum tomatoes rather than canned. Used chopped fresh oregano rather than basil. Did not have cream so used chunks of fresh mozzarella tossed into finished pasta and sauce. Topped with a bit of reserved pieces of cooked pancetta and fresh grated pecorino romano. Placed the finished individual plates into a 200 degreed oven for a few minutes to finish and allow flavors to linger. A simple meal but quite lovely.

This dish is delicious and very easy to make. However, I could not in good conscience use canned tomatoes in the summer (especially not in the Garden State!). So, I used seeded and chopped Roma tomatoes with great success. I'll save the canned tomatoes for the winter! I also put half the pancetta into the sauce so that the flavors would meld together better. Same with half the basil. Altogether, a tasty and simple supper.

No flavor, soupy. Needs more of everything--except the penne. A much better recipe that's similar is the Fettuccine w/ Tomatoes, Bacon, Arugula and Goat Cheese on this site. You can substitute spinach (or maybe basil) for the arugula.

Delicious! I did alter the recipe slightly. To make the tomatoes less acidic, I added 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Also, to thicken the sauce, I took half of the sauce and blended it until smooth, then added it back to the sauce. It came out thick and full of flavor. Will definitely make this again!

This was a very simple, easy meal. I thought it could use a little flavor boost.First off i drained the bacon grease ( ew all that fat is gross.)Secondly, I used half and half instead of cream.It did curdle at first but after it was reduced and added to the pasta it didn't seem to matter. Basil is good, add MORE than it calls for, double the garlic,add a little more milk than called for, add more bacon, and lots of parmesean cheese and salt. In spite of all these changes i will make this again!

Good, simple recipe. Not a tremendous amount of flavor, however, because the canned tomatoes really dominate. I doubled the pancetta and garlic as suggested.

So easy to make, and tastes rich and delicious. After making as directed I added some parmesan cheese to the top, sprinkled with the pancetta and basil and baked for 10 minutes to get a crusty top. Will make this again and again.

Following the suggestions of some other reviewers, I used about twice the pancetta and 6 cloves of garlic (pressed). Also had to sub a combo of red wine & sherry (1/4 cup each) for the white wine because we didn't have any white on hand. Simmered for about 10 minutes before adding the cream, as my tomatoes had a lot of juice, then about 10+ minutes over low heat after adding the cream. Made sure the pancetta was cooked until VERY crisp at the beginning, which took a good 20 minutes or more. Didn't use any extra salt or pepper at the end. We thought this was very good, a nice & easy weeknight meal that even my 4 year old enjoyed. (And my 2-year old had about 6 helpings of the penne with no sauce, so she was happy, too.)

Rating: 2
This dish was ok, but nothing very thrilling. The pancetta gives a great flavour, but the recipe needs a lot more of it (and more garlic) and perhaps some spices as well. I would leave the sauce to simmer for a *lot* longer than 10 minutes next time - but I think that there are other recipes that require just as little time and effort that are a lot more rewarding.

Delicious! Having lived in Italy, I am very picky about my pasta. This was a winner. My husband who says he does not like tomato sauces with cream in them, loved it! I am sending it to my daughter to share with her husband. P.S. I used thick smoky bacon instead of the Pancetta with very good results.

THIS HAS BEEN A BIG HIT WITH FAMILY & FRIENDS! I've made it six times in two months, mostly by request. I doubled the recipe, simmered/reduced 1.5 hours, used a stick blender and it served 3-4 as a main course. I've even forgotten the basil on occasion and it is still wonderful. (Next time I'll try adding my homemade pesto.) It has a very 'fresh' flavour. Since several reviewers suggested adding sugar if too acidic I just used my 'house wine' which is a somewhat sweeter white. Also DOUBLED the garlic and agreed with the "leave the bacon in to cook" idea. It needs the heavy cream. Reheats very well but had to add some Extra-Spicy Clamato juice for extra liquid after the pasta had absorbed the sauce.

Rating: 4
This is part of our regular rotation. I've never served it to anyone who hasn't asked for the recipe; even if I've doubled or even tripled it! It's great with any kind of canned tomatoes, but buy the best you can get; don't use cheap canned tomatoes because they taste canned.

This was delicious but the sauce did not reduce as much as I expected. When I mixed in the pasta however, it coated it well, but was not by any means a thick sauce. Regardless, it was quickly devoured by my family and I will make it again!

DELICIOUS and super simple. Used 65 percent less fat Louis Rich bacon (nuked in paper towels) instead of the pancetta, increased the garlic and sauteed it in olive oil, used half and half instead of the heavy cream, used cheapy canned diced tomatoes, Mostaccioli instead of Penne pasta. Just before serving I put the bacon crumples and some freshly grated Parmesan cheese into the sauce. YUMMY!!!

Rating: 4
I got RAVE reviews on this recipe. I thought it was really tasty. I use regular bacon instead of pancetta and it is great (and cheaper). Adding it at the last second gives the dish a little crisp that is nice. When it is sitting in the sauce, it just gets soggy. Also, the first time I made this, I found it way too oily. Now I eliminate the olive oil altogether, and drip off most of the bacon drippings, leaving just enough to cook the garlic (which I greatly increased--6 or 7 cloves--I'm a big garlic fan). Quick and easy--yum!

We've made this twice for guests. Rave reviews each time. As previously stated, it relies on the quality of the ingredients, we used canned plum tomatoes, fresh basil and pancetta from the Italian deli. We served it with parmesan, as suggested. Word of caution, don't put in extra pancetta, it makes it too salty.

Rating: 3
An excellent simple recipe. My husband is European and very picky about food. He loved this recipe. It is uncomplicated, allowing for the flavors to come through, so use quality ingredients. I didn't have any problems with the taste of "canned tomatoes" as some reviewers noted. I think an easy to make but delicious recipe is a godsend on a busy evening. I took the advice of several others and added the pancetta to simmer and blended half of the sauce. I had actually run out of cream and substituted 1% milk (I was worried it might not turn out) and it still turned out wonderful. I will try it with cream next time, although I may leave it with the milk for a lighter summer meal.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful weeknight pasta dish! I didn't have a problem with the sauce reducing, but since I only made half a recipe, I only used one can of tomoatoes. Used shells instead penne so the nooks and crannies could hold the sauce better. I agree with the other reviewer... just leave the pancetta in the sauce.

My sweetie doesn't like tomatoes (but likes tomato sauce -- will eat tomato paste out of the can! -- go figure) so we use Pommi. Have made it a couple of times and once used Procuitto instead -- just as wonderful. Enjoy.

I made half the recipe and it still took longer than 10 minutes for the sauce to reduce, so plan accordingly. My torn basil started to seriously darken so I added it all to the sauce, and that was fine. No cheese is called for here, but we used some grated Parmesan on the pasta; not much because of the saltiness of the pancetta. Although I had penne on hand, I made boccatini and it was delicious with the sauce. By the way, the sauce tastes much better on the pasta than it does sipping it from a spoon from the saucepan. I can understand why some reviewers chose to blend part of the sauce for a more even texture. I might try that another time.

I agree with Tracy below - that this recipe is best with the freshest, most quality ingredients you can find. It's a simple recipe, but definitely relies on fine ingredients. I also added a few fresh hothouse tomatoes for flavor. I will definitely make again. It's a good mid-week meal.

This really is excellent! Next time I will 1.5 the sauce, as we like ample. I will also add more pancetta. I used regular diced tomatoes, reduced 25% with 1/3 cup wine/4 garlic cloves, then blended with stick blender--added cream & pancetta and simmered 5 mins--then added basil. The pancetta infused the sauce with a rich flavor. My tomatoes were a bit acidic, the addition of a dash of sugar remedied it. This is delicious comfort food!

I thought this was very good. To answer the vodka versus wine question....vodka in this type of pasta sauce is a classic combination. I read (and make) a lot of recipes and I've actually seen vodka used more often than wine. I have a favourite recipe from an old issue of Bon Appetit that calls for vodka and some whipping cream together with onions and tomatoes, but no bacon or pancetta, to make a very similar sauce for penne pasta. Totally delicious but not that healthy, so I rarely make it these days. I wouldn't describe vodka as having a 'medicinal' taste at all - you just don't notice the flavour of the alcohol in the finished dish.

Rating: 0
Re vodka instead of white wine: I think it would change the flavour considerably, but probably not for the better. Vodka has a strong, biting and almost medicinal flavour, that is why it pairs so well with both sweet and tangy fruit juices. However, white vermouth is an excellent stand-in for white wine and I always keep a bottle in the pantry just for cooking purposes. As I recall, Julia Child also subs vermouth for white wine.

Great with pancetta. The fresh basil is wonderful. This tastes good as is, but it is also tasty with some goat cheese on top. I didn't find the sauce too thin, but perhaps that's because I used a 3-quart sautepan (thus, shallow & wide), so much of the liquid boiled off & the sauce thickened.

Delicious! My Italian husband is not a pasta fan (go figure), so I made the sauce to serve over sautéed chicken breasts and it was absolutely delicious. The first time I made the sauce I added some chopped mushrooms and it was "okay", but the second time I made the sauce I stayed true to the recipe and it was fabulous. The only modifications that I would make in the future would be to chop the pancetta into a smaller dice, I would also follow Dublin's advice and to deglaze the pan with the wine then continue with the recipe as written. This was absolutely delicious as a sauce, I think it would be outstanding on the pasta!

Absolutely delicious! I used the bacon and regular diced tomatoes (I couldn't find the petite-cut without "zesty jalapenos" added in them). I left out the wine, since I don't like the taste of alcohol, even cooked in my food, but that also took care of the sauce being too thin, which others said was a problem. I learned the joys of fresh basil with this dish- the smell and taste are unbelievable! I also used light cream to save some fat, and whole wheat penne for a nice nutritional boost- still mouth-watering!

I made the recipe as is and thought it was wonderful. Especially for a week night meal. I used the pancetta and thought it had a very complementary flavor.

This recipe was great. As others said, the sauce isn't very thick so I thickened it a bit with a roux made from flour, butter, and some of the sauce for liquid. This thickened it nicely without affecting the flavor. I also used one can of diced yellow roma tomatoes for a little more color, and added some vegetables (mushrooms and broccoli) for more substance. This tasted great, and I will definately make it again.

Simple and easy dinner. Recommend draining more of the bacon fat and maybe using 1/3 cup each of the wine and whipping cream, as my sauce did not thicken up as much as I would like. Or prepare as is and cook longer, as other readers did (my pasta was ready and I didn't feel like waiting).
