I have made this dish several times now and it is a winner every time. The recipe just as is, is perfect but I do like to grate a fresh potato. It has more flavor than the frozen hash browns. I have also made it with red onions instead of the green onions and that was good too. Overall- delicious!!

Made this for Christmas brunch and it was really easy to make and prepare. Perfect for a group. I ended up making two frittatas, one in a non-stick skillet and one in a cast iron pan. Both worked great. I did add more potatoes (as others suggested) and then split the boursin between the two pans. I did note that a lot of guests thought it was garlicky. And it was with only half the cheese. So, if you are worried or not a super fan of garlic herb boursin, I would cut back the cheese. Makes decent leftovers and can see this recipe as a base for other ingredients as others have said. Only other thing I would suggest is that this served more than four people. I cut them in regular slices and got about 8 pieces out of it.

This was delicious and very easy. Used Alexia hash browns and the eggs did not need any additional salt. Served it for my great niece's 2nd birthday brunch and it was a big hit! Next time I might add a little smoked salmon. Yum!

Loved this, but haven't actually made the exact recipe yet. I followed the concept, but instead of the frozen hash browns, which I didn't have on hand, I used fresh potatoes that I put through the shredding disc of my food processor. I used 4 small or 3 large spuds (peeled). Used them as directed in recipe without issue. Also, I have had success adding leftovers on top of the eggs: in one case, a prosciutto-shiitake mixture left over from the previous night's stuffed chicken breast; in another, roasted asparagus. I've used asiago in these cases, just because I had it. This frittata is truly a restaurant dish. I really love the versatility of it, and the ease-to- wow ratio.

Made this for the first time last night (our eggs from a local farm were about to expire), and we loved it! Easy and delicious. I used about 3/4 of the Boursin; you could also buy some with a milder flavor.

Good flavor and pretty easy but the boursin can be a bit overwhelming. I'd double the potatoes and reduce the amount of boursin.

Always a hit at our house, but I use have the Boursin.

Love this receipe. Added lobster claws on top for the last 5 minutes. Delicious! Only issue is to get the potatoes crispy enough...

This is a fantastic recipe for a quick weeknight dinner. I used diced red onion and some garlic instead of the scallions, and I only used half a package of Boursin since that's all I had on hand. I think half the amount was plenty, though. I will actually omit the salt completely next time because the hash browns I use (Alexia) are seasoned so well. I will definitely put this in the dinner rotation.

Excellent Brunch dish and very easy for a Gourmet recipe.

This is a great, easy recipe. I've made it at least a dozen times and each time I change it up by adding different varieties of vegetables. But, the one constant is the boursin cheese which adds a great favor.

I've made this recipe several times now, and it is always a hit. I used chopped onion instead of the scallions. I think that may add a little more flavor. Make sure you use all of the boursin--the first time I made it, it seemed like a lot, but it makes a big difference. My 9-year-old son loved it!

Made this last night and it was good, but not excellent. I found it was missing something - it needed more seasoning or more flavor(and I added a teaspoon of salt as another reviewer suggested.)

I used 4 whole eggs and 4 egg whites and used Walnut & Fig Boursin which gives the dish a slightly sweet flavor that cuts with the bland nuttiness of the hashbrowns.

Rating: 2
Good, but not superb. I love eggs with cream cheese, but found 5 ounces of boursin to be completely overwhelming. If I make this again I will likely up the amount of potatoes by 50%, and reduce the cheese by 50%.

This was a big hit for Christmas morning brunch - my stepmother had to have the recipe! The hash browns had thawed prior to cooking, which I think was a good thing. I might actually add more hash browns next time, but absolutely a keeper! Would be good with any melting cheese, but might want to add some garlic and herbs. Yum! Also, super easy to make. I used a very well seasoned cast iron skillet, and although we decided to serve it from the skillet, it did not stick.

A winner recipe for brunch or supper. Sliced in wedges the next day, it was a good lunchbox item. Quite rich, but excellent.

loved it! made it as directed for mother's day brunch - the smoked salmon is a must and brings out a lot of the boursin's flavor. easy and delicious!!

This was very quick to prepare for brunch, without compromising on flavor. The bourisn really gives the dish lots of flavor and moistness. My friends all cleaned their plates!

This is truly a fabulous and simple brunch recipe! I'm more of a cook to order kind of cook. But we needed something simple for a dozen-person brunch. This was a perfect single item to serve. I opted to follow the recipe exactly (although doubling). It was fabulous. No problems at all. I can see that it's also very versatile. Gruyere would be great, as would some additional vegetables. Also, I cooked two in cast iron skillets. I was concerned about sticking, but no problems at all.

Friday night -- what's in the fridge? I used Guyere on top, "southern" hash browns, cream cheese, and diced up some leftover steamed cauliflower. Very fast, and well-appreciated. 3 1/2 forks, probably.

Very good and easy. Served with a mixed green salad and some smoked salmon.

This was absolutely great if you're looking to try something different! There is definitely some "wiggle room" in terms of variation. I may try it next time with a good pesto blended in the eggs, but it stands well on it's own!! Very quick and easy, perfect for a brunch of light dinner.

Loved this dish for a light dinner and leftovers tasted even better the next day. It does need some "tweaking" though: It needs much more than 1/4 tsp. salt! Next time, I will use 1 tsp. salt; regular chopped onions rather than scallions for more flavor; and will cook the potatoes and onions longer before adding the eggs to make the potatoes more crispy (6 minutes rather than 3). It is also not necessary to invert the frittata. I cut into wedges and served right out of the pan. A dash of Tabasco sauce gives a nice "kick" when used as a condiment at the dinner table. Enjoy!

Great brunch item, but need to make sure pan is truly non-stick, otherwise comes out in blob. Still tastes good, but looks sloppy

I made this dish tonight for my three children ages 2-6 and all loved it, including me. It's nice to find a quick and easy meal that appeals to all. After reading the other reviews I decided to mix 3/4 of the Boursin in with the eggs using an electric hand mixer. The eggs fluffed nicely and the Boursin blended well. I dolleped the rest on top. I also used less olive oil and didn't miss it. I would make this frittata again, served with a simple salad it made a great meal, all three kids have already requested it!

This was a nice, easy and fairly quick breakfast cassarole. It was similar to a Tortilla Espanola except with the Boursin. I think next time I might add a little something to give it more zip, like maybe the peppered boursin or green chilies. It is a nice simple and basic dish that you can easily add to should you wish to do so.

Nope. We liked the flavor but found the oven baking process didn't set the eggs, even after 20 min. Used the broiler at that point. Also, how do you "crumble" a soft cheese like Boursin (maybe I should have chilled it in the freezer), so I had "clumps" rather than crumbles.

Rating: 3
Very easy, and very adaptable. My only quibble is that one bunch of scallions was nowhere near 2 cups. I like the idea from the previous reviewer to carmalize onions and sub goat cheese, and will try. I also think trying a tex-mex version, with a small can of jalapenos and cheddar-jack would be good.

Rating: 4
Delicous! I've made it as written, and it's wonderful. If I have extra time, I substitute carmelized onions for the green onion and goat cheese for the boursin, and it's even better.

I amde this for mothers day brunch. Since I needed more than 4 servings I increased by 1/2. I spread the potatoes in a pyrex and then poured the egg over. It came out great (I din't invert it) though I did need to bake for longer than 15 minutes. Yum!

To the cook from Singapore: either the tator tots or hash browns should work. Just break them up so that they are "shredded" instead of how the come. "Frozen shredded hash browns" are really just frozen grated potatoes (for those that don't have time to grate potatoes themselves). Not sure what Potato Nuggets are...

I had to add a bit more salt and spread the Boursin cheese around after baking as it doesn't melt down. 15 minutes baking time was a bit too much. I thought it was great for dinner and breakfast the next day!

I live in Singapore and dont seem to be able to find "shredded" hash brown. We've got the tater tots, potato nuggets and hash brown. can any of these replace the shredded hash needed in the recipe?

Absolutely delicious and easy. I'd use 3 c potatoes instead of 2 as they shrink quite a bit. Was great for a light supper served with salad.

In these parts, shredded hash browns don't come in bags. Used little cubes -- worked just fine. This is a genuine quickie -- not just quick after 30 minutes of prep! Delicious and on-hand ingredients Yay!

Made this for New Year's day brunch. Do give this one a try. It was quick, easy. Not complex, but simple and delicious! Even the kid liked it! As other cooks said, it's a good one to "play" with. The leftovers were even good. Think I'll throw some crab meat into the next one!!

This recipe is fabulous! Easy too and completely yummy! The suggestion to use smoked salmon as an accompaniment on the plate is wonderful - definately worth the extra expense if you like smoked salmon. I bought chopped hash browns instead of shredded by mistake and it still turned out great. I'm also impressed by the recipe's versatility. To make use of ingredients in your frig you can easily add things like sauteed mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, bell peppers etc.

I doubled this recipe for lunch on New Year's Day for 6 adults. Everyone loved it! It was very simple to make and I agree, the Boursin cheese is what makes this dish special. I will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy. Couldn't find the right flavor Boursin so I used Neufchatel (cream cheese would have worked too) into which I foleded rosemary and thyme. I added spinach, ham and a diced tomato on top before the eggs. Cooked like a dream.
