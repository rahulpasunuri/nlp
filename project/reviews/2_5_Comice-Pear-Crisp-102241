Excellent. I used our sieck pears which are crunchy pears...I thought the topping was nice and crisp..I used 1T less butter in the recipe.

While I know Chez Panisse is an excellent restaurant, I've never had any luck with its recipes and will avoid them in future. There are much better pear crisp recipes.

We had company so I thought I would use this recipe instead of my usual crisp--big mistake! It was very bland and not very crisp. Comice are really delicious eating pears, but I will keep using Bosc pears for baking. My regular crisp recipe is wonderful with pears, its really a simple batter with flour, sugar, butter and an egg. A standard crisp recipe with oatmeal and brown sugar would be better than this recipe as well.

I've now made it twice, and would make the following recommendations. Make sure your pears are ripe and soft for full flavor. The second time I also added cranberries and a bit of pear brandy. These adjustments made for a bit more flavor and color.

i marinated the pears in brandy and sugar before baking them which made for an interesting flavor. this dish was just ok - good if you're in a pinch timewise to make something and you have some ripe pears on hand: it's quick and easy.

I find the pears to be a bit bland. They do not stand up well to the topping. Perhaps a bit of spice mixed in with the pears would liven them up a bit.
