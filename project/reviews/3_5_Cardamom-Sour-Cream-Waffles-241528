Good not great - especially if you like a crispy outside/chewy inside kind of waffle. My nephew called them "floppy":( I did however like the cardamom flavor and the kitchen smelled wonderful! I may experiment with these a bit more, perhaps folding in an egg white or 2 would help give a little crunch.

Delicious! I made with half whole wheat flour and used buttermilk instead of sour cream. Double this--they go fast!

I've made this a few times with yogurt and fooled around with different type flours, added flax ect.. My kids did not like the cardamom, so I've used cinnamon instead. Also, olive oil, not butter - I'm trying to perfect a healthier waffle. Very moist, not really crispy, but very tasty. Never any left over, I think because the kids like them softer.

We just had these for brakfast. I liked the hint of cardamom. Used yogurt for the sour cream. We subbed a half cup of whole wheat flour for the white and upped the milk and honey by a bit to compensate. Served with sliced strawberries and apriums along with maple syrup. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipie. The cardamom makes them unusual but not too weird for my 3 year old. My wife loved them for Mother's Day, which scored major points for me. Prepped in advance and then I set the batter in the refrigerator for an hour, which made things even easier.

A very good, basic waffle recipe. The waffles came out light and fluffy. Great with plain old maple syrup but you could use any topping you wanted. Whether or not to double or triple the cardamom as some reviewers have said is purely an individual decision. I used a half teaspoon and it was just right for me. Our three little girls raved and so did Daddy! We'll make it again for sure.

good waffles. would be best for folks who do not like their waffles sweet and like cardamom.

Made this as written with the 2x cardamom, which still wasn't overwhelming. My waffle maker died while making these so I ended up making them into pancakes instead. They were very good, but dense. Nice to know that the recipe was flexible to use another way.

I was out of cardamom, so I subbed in cinnamon and they were still yummy!

Great recipe; simple and delicious. Definitely double the cardamom!

I doubled the cardamom and substituted 2% greek yogurt (Fage brand) for the sour cream. I also added 1 juice orange worth of fresh juice and about a teaspoon or so of contriau (sp?) to add some orange flavor. I served them with powdered sugar and creme fraiche. They were quite good. I'll make them again.

These were pretty good. I liked the whisper of cardamom, and I liked the fact it wasn't overpowering. We didn't have lingonberry preserves on hand, so regular maple syrup (real, of course) did in a pinch. It wasn't my favorite breakfast, but tasty.

I love cardamom so I doubled the amount. The ligonberry preserves added the perfect finish. These waffles introduced a new flavour to a traditional waffle.

These are okay. I found the amount of cardamom to be perfect - subtle, but there. I also grated some orange zest (about 1/2 Tbs) into the batter, just because orange and cardamom are the perfect pair. However what I did not care for was the "eggy" taste from using 2 eggs in the batter. Overall, I don't feel I would make these again.

These waffles are a nice basic waffle, good texture and easy enough to make, but we could not detect the cardamon at all. Not even a hint! I love cardamon and was looking forward to tasting it in my waffle, but...... next time, I would probably try a tablespoon.
