The next time I make this I will not bother marinating the cut chicken with the sauce the day before. It didn't seem to make a difference. I cut the fish sauce to 3 T. because of the 1st reviewers comment. Glad I did. Make sure you have quality fresh herbs. I didn't use all of mine. Trust your instincts on how much you may want to chop up. It's worth trying. Great leftover.

This is God awful. 1/2 cup of fish sauce? I've never used more than a few tablespoons in my life, it overwhelms it with terrible saltiness. 2 cups of cilantro, 1 cup of mint, 1 cup of basil is also an insane amount of all 3. Maybe I missed something here, but this was literally inedible in the end, and I threw 2 pounds of chicken and the rest of it in the green bin.

I'm a little shocked this doesn't have any reviews or ratings yet. Yum! Fantastic! I initially wondered when I looked at the recipe if the flavours would be a bit intense, but everything came together beautifully. I did cut back the heat to half a serrano (the only hot peppers I could find) because my son is currently on a spice-restricted diet, but other than that I made the meal exactly as written. It was perfect, I wouldn't change a thing, next time I'll likely try it with more heat, but the amount I used worked fine.
