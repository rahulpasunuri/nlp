Agree with prior post - underrated. Great with fish, nice alternative to plain rice. Added italian parsley for texture. Deelishh!

This recipe is underrated. It was a simple enough recipe with simple ingredients. Needed a bit of varying the butter, lemon juice and salt to taste but fairly easy to get it right. I prefer it with more butter. Give it more flavour.

It went pretty well with fish. I did cut down on the lemon juice too but added some lemon zest to give it an extra zing.

Something odd happened when I added the lemon juice to the rice and garlic mixture: the garlic turned turquoise. Perhaps someone has some insight into what happened?

Not bad at all. I halved the lemon juice and the lemon flavor was subtle yet enough. Beware of rice drying out. I'd make this again.

I've made this recipe twice, served both times with fish (once salmon, the next orange ruffie). Delicious. Just a note: if you add too much lemon juice counteract it with milk.
