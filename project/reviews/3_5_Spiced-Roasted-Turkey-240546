This recipe was ok, but nothing that I would make again. We found it very salty (would decrease the salt to 2 tsp if we were to make it again, and the flavors of the rub didn't permeate into the meat.

This was the most amazing turkey I have ever tasted, well worth the extra work.

The spice combination for this was amazing. I will make it again, but I will not cook it at 450 the entire time - my 12 lb turkey reached temperature in only 45 minutes so it was a bit stringy; the good taste made up for it.

Made this recipe a week earlier than T-day to try it out...Overall, pretty darn tasty, though I had to make some changes. First: Could not find star anise or schewann sp) peppercorns anywhere, but did follow the rest of the butter/breast stuffing Second: I was roasting an 18 lb bird, so I decreased the temp to 350. I foiled the breasts for the 1st 90 minutes, then basted with the juices every 20 minutes or so, until the thigh meat hit 170. Gravy was delish, though I omitted the giblets. I would recommend this recipe for anyone not into the traditional flavors of t-day, but still wanting to do a traditional thing
