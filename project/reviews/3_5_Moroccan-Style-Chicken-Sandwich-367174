Very good. Insteresting mix of flavors. Harissa can be quite spicy hot.

This turned out great! I wasn't quite sure how the olives, raisins, tomatoes, etc would taste together but it was wonderful. We finished half of the chicken mixture tonight, saving the other half until tomorrow. My husband thought it would be just as good combining remaining relish with chicken, along with the remaining yogurt and harissa, to make a somewhat creamy filling. I think that's a better way to serve. I used chopped up raisins instead of currants.

This was so tasty!! Lots of flavors. I didn't have sherry vinegar but some red wine vinegar and a dash of balsamic worked fine. Made a big difference to eat it at room temp, rather than cold. Since the chicken salad part, itself, has no garlic, it really benefits from the additional kick of the harissa spread. But I didn't have a chance to go chase down harissa. So I improvised using http://mideastfood.about.com/od/dipsandsauces/r/harissa.htm -- and I thought it turned out great!

I made it just as a chicken salad, adding all the relish to the chicken and serving the harisa/yogurt as "dressing." Lots of fun and interesting flavors. I wouldn't skip any of the spices, but you can adjust the proportions of tomato/almonds/olives with the dressing to preference. Next time, I'll use fewer almonds to give the rest of the flavors more room. It's also easy enough to make your own harissa, if you have the time. This was easy to make and a welcome change from the usual.

This is a flavorful recipe well worth making. I would probably make more of the green olive-almond relish next time as it is a wonderful garnish in the sandwich. I really wouldn't change a thing in this recipe - love it just as it is.
