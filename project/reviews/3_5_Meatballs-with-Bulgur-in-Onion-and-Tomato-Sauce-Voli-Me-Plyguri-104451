Just made this again for probably the fifth time. Organic lamb and tons of parsley from my garden. Large bulb onions and their green tops. The only thing i skimped on was substuting cinnamon stick with cinnamon. Used Near East tabbouleh ( with spice packet) instead of plain bulgher and omitted salt otherwise. It's now a well-loved tradition in our family.

I really wanted to love this recipe. I love lamb, meatballs,and greek food. We did not like the texture on the meatball (even though I think the idea is fantastic). I modified the sauce to be more of a pasta sauce, and it tasted fine. All and all, not worth the effort.

I was out of plain bulgher but had some Middle East tabbouleh on hand. Used it all, including the spice packet. Really good (used all ground lamb).

We pretty much followed the recipe and went with veal and lamb. The latter seems mandatory for the middle-east character of the recipe. Added cardamom and coriander plus salt/pepper to taste. The result was excellent. When we served the leftovers, we added yogurt to the sauce and garnished with cilantro. Even better than the original.

I think it's delicious, but the tomato sauce needs salt and pepper. Maybe next time I would add more bulgur, because I didn't feel it's flavor. Besides that It's a very good recipe.

Really yummy. Had to cook down the sauce and added less wine, but fab flavors!

This was amazing. My husband is from Egypt and said it tasted like something that he would have in a restaurant there. I loved it !! my guests did too. It will be made again!

I was excited to find this recipe because I had nearly all the ingredients on hand! I doubled the cumin and also added the same amount of cardamom and coriader. I added just a pinch of ground cinnamon. I used less olive oil for sauteeing the onions. Overall, this was quite tasty and an easy quick meal. However, in the future I would totally carmelize the onion and use even more spices. Also, perhaps because I am used to ground turkey, I found this a bit too fatty despite the reduction of oil. I liked it but there are better protein/bulgar recipes (like Jane Brody's) and I would not make it again.

I read the reviews first and, as I was using ground lamb, decided to saute the meatballs to reduce fat; also I added some tomato sauce along with diced tomatoes, and used just a little water. I reduced the sauce some, while I sauted the meatballs. The end result was excellent: tasty sauce and juicy and flavorful meatballs. I served it with steamed brown rice and steamed sugar snap peas on the side. My two young daughters gave this two thumbs up! I will definitely make it again!

I wish I had read these reviews first, but I was in such a hurry to get cooking. Meatballs were great, need a little more salt. Sauce was way too thin. Next time I'll use san marzano tomoatoes instead of canned chopped tomoatoes and reduce the sauce, add a little more salt and maybe some oregano. I didn't pre-cook the meatballs and liked them a lot, but will try pre-cooking next time to add more flavor.

I am a professional chef and I love this recipe. Don't bother pre-cooking the meatballs, you will lose all the flavor. Also, I never use fresh tomatoes unless they are in season. Use quality canned san marzanos for your sauce and reduce by half. This way you will have a sauce that packs a punch. What a great recipe for a cold winters night.

Just tried this last night, and while the meatballs were okay (used ground lamb), the sauce is thin and tasteless. After considering ways to make it more interesting, we decided not to bother.

I brought this to a potluck and everyone asked for the recipe. They loved it. I'd never made meatballs before and I found this to be very easy to make.

We baked the meatballs separately and weren't happy with the results. I think the sauce would have benefitted from the lamb juices during the cooking. We will leave it overnight and see what happens -- now it is somewhat tasteless.

Really nice. Broiling the meatballs to defat them is strongly advised. I used canned crushed tomatoes and their juice, which tends to be a bit thicker than the juice of fresh tomatoes, which are not in season in Russia at this time of year anyway! Serve with lavash to soak up the yummy tomato sauce.

These were excellent. I used lean ground lamb, but instead of cooking the meatballs in the sauce, I baked them at 375 for about 12 minutes to get rid of some of the grease. I then drained them on paper towels and added them to the simmering sauce. Unlike the other reviewers, I did not find the sauce too runny even with the addition of the water. The flavors blended perfectly and the dish was even better the next day.

I served this to guests, and several people asked for the recipe. Simple to make and flavorful. I served it with chunky buttered mashed potatoes and feta cheese sprinkled over the top. Don't bother refrigerating the meatballs a second time. Just drop them into the sauce straightaway.

I loved this recipe. I would give it 3 solid forks. My boyfriend said he'd give it 2.5 forks. It was easy and very tasty but the sauce was a little runny. I made it almost exactly as the recipe stated, except I left out the extra water, as others had suggested, and it was still a little runny. Other than that, it was great, especially the cinnamon.

A solid 3.5 forks. I browned the meatballs in a non-stick skillet before adding to the sauce. Added only half the water so the sauce stayed thick and served with a greek salad with feta. Absolutely delicious.

Don't get me wrong...I did enjoy this. I think that I'm going to try to skip the water next time. The sauce was too diluted.

Delicious! We especially loved the cinnamon in the sauce, which was a gorgeous complement to the cumin in the meat. I used really good, pasture-raised ground beef and added a little dill to the mix, since I didn't have quite enough parsley. Make these a day ahead if you can--the flavors are more vivid after a night in the refrigerator.

We enjoyed this dish very much. Simple to make, will definitely prepare again.

I liked this, but it didn't really pack the flavor punch I was looking for. And maybe it's just me but I thought that by not browning the meat balls first, that alot of grease ended up in the sauce.

Excellent and simple dish. I usually use ground turkey and have consistently had excellent results. As was noted, make sure that you divide the garlic and olive as specified in the instructions.

I made this with gimme lean beef style and it was delicious, no other changes. My meat eating boyfriend and teenage son enjoyed it. Although I would consider adding a can of tomato sauce or using crushed tomatoes next time.

I couldn't find any bulgur so I used cooked rice instead. I've made this twice now, and the second time I made it I ensured that the scallions were chopped really fine so that the meatballs would not disintegrate, which they partly had the first time. I served them with rice pilaf and green beans. A keeper!

I made this as an appetizer and it was a hit, I think it would be great served with rice as dinner or perhaps even over pasta.

Absolutely delicious! Much better that most other meatball recipes I've tasted.The bulgur adds a new dimension and the sauce is also very special.A definite recommendation!

This was absolutely wonderful. Using scallions instead of onions really gave the meatballs a bit more depth. The meatballs were very savory. Definitely a keeper (and that's saying something because I rarely make the same dish twice!)

This was great! The bulghur made these very different, dense and chewy. I had no problem at all with the meatballs "falling apart" when cooking. Served with orzo, pitas and Greek yoghurt cucumber salad (sorry I forget how to spell the Greek word for this). Leftovers were even better than the first night.
