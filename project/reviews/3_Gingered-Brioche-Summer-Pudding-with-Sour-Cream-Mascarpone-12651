A visually dazzling as well as scrumptious dessert; however, the recipe would lead you to believe it produces copious juices. Not true in the approx. 10 times I've made it. I've compensated by increasing slightly the water/sugar/component. Minced candied ginger added to the garnish (or atop the cream)resulted in raves. Purple-hearted plums produce, for me, the most appealing color. The sour cream mascarpone is quite rich (and luscious), but I've used whipped cream, whipped creme fraiche, sweetened plain yogurt and vanilla ice cream with equal success. A mid-summer treasure since the recipe came out in 1996.
