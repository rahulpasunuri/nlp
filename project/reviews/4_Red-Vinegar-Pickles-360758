Delicious! I forgot to add the bay leaf, but followed the recipe otherwise. The first reviewer is right about the quantity- 3 1/2 c. of cucumber slices is about right for a quart jar. My son, who dislikes pickles, even gave them two thumbs-up!

Follow up review: Skimpy brine proved to be no problem, the cucumbers sank into it after several hours. These pickles are crispy and yummy and so easy to make. Highly recommended! Makes a lot of pickles, next time I'll make half.

I just made these and there wasn't enough brine to cover the veggies. It seems the top cucumbers will just be less flavorful? I'll report back, but in the meantime use only 3 1/2 cups of cucumbers. (I used 4.)
