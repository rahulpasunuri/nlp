These are crazy good. I will definitely make them again. Serve them with tziziki sauce.

These patties were delicious! I did not want to wait for the bulgur to soften, so I used 3 T of plain breadcrumbs to 1.3 lbs of ground lamb, and I thought the consistency was just fine. I did use the paprika, but did not have cilantro, and I found the seasoning blend wonderful! My one complaint would be the greasiness of the patties. I brushed them with olive oil before grilling them in a Le Crueset grill pan and the pan was full of grease by the time they were all cooked. I think it would've been fine to just brush the grill lightly or even use cooking spray. My kids loved these!

I used 1 TB of breadcrumbs instead of bulgar, and I left out the egg. This made the meatballs a little more crumbly, but I prefer it that way. I served them over a quinoa salad with tomato, cucumber, parsley, tahini and lemon. Definitely use the yogurt sauce! I used mint in it instead of parsley and it was a great addition. This definitely fulfilled my Greek food craving!

I had leftover brown rice that I chopped up & used instead of the bulgur...had to add a few breadcrumbs too because my egg was very large. Excellent!

These were quite easy and tasty-a great combo if you ask me. I didn't have any bulgur, but I added about a 1/4 c of pita crumbs and they turned out just fine. Definitely make a yogurt sauce accompaniment. I added a small minced clove of garlic to the recipe given in the notes at top--perfect with chopped tomatoes, greens and pita. Great weekday dinner, but would be nice enough to impress at a bbq get together.

Really?? This tastes nothing like gyro meat. It was ok, but definitely not what we were expecting based on the reviews.

Great. Added cinnamon and allspice. Served in pitas with cucumber and tomato salad and yogurt.

These were very good. I used 2 lbs of lamb and 1/2 lb of beef, 3x seasoning, and foergot to buy parsley so I used a couple of tablespoons of fresh oregano. Also added the zest of 1 lemon. Great right out of the pan -- Somebody stop my husband before they're gone! -- and also simmered in a light tomato soup I'd made last night for a light dinner. Will eat a few with soup for lunch today, will save the rest for another night, probably over rice with grilled vegetables.

These were very good. A couple of tips: to get a better 'gyro' texture, put the prepared meat into the processor to further grind. Not only will they stay together better, but the compacted mixture will more resemble the gyro meat you get in a restaurant. Also, some fresh lemon zest, about a teaspoon, really enhances the lamb. I also chop fresh mint for my yogurt sauce, which adds a nice flavor to this dish.

I made this for a book club meeting aolong with tabbouleh and yogurt-marinated chicken kabobs. Substituted 50/50 ground beef and pork (since I couldn't find ground lamb)and broiled them in the oven. This was a HUGE hit! Everyone loved and it was the first dish gone. I will be making this over and over.

Excellent recipe. So easy and quick and very flavorful. This recipe also works well for making delicious hamburgers also.

Really nice easy to make and very filling. Tastes just like a gyro and I had it with a yogurt, mint and cucumber salad. Would have also been heavenly in a pita. A go to recipe the next time I have ground lamb.

I made these as a sandwich offering for a party following the recipe exactly (served in mini pitas, with the cucumber yogurt sauce and chopped tomatoes) and they were a huge hit - even really un-adventurous family members who "don't eat lamb" loved them. I will definitely make these again.

Loved these meatballs. I added an extra clove of garlic and broiled them. Otherwise, made the recipe as is and they were delicious! Very easy, too. I will make these again.

A great, easy, weekday meal. I zipped up the sauce a bit - used chopped mint and garlic along with the cumin and salt, and it was delicious (even the kids thought so).

Made it as written but since it started raining, I also made it indoors on a skillet. Nice enough with a tzatziki sauce, but I was disappointed and thought it needed more flavors and seasonings. I wondered if thyme and oregano and/or mint might help. Maybe I'll try again with some revisions. Any suggestions?

Simply super delish and easy. I'm making it again this weekend for friends who have palates with high expectations...

perfectly respectable use of ground lamb with common kitchen ingredients. I didn't grill (probably would have been even better). I pan-seared for 3+ minutes on each side, and made a 1/2 recipe. Really good.

Very Yummy!!!

Excellent Mediterranean meal - pair with yogurt salad and lentil side dish

the yogurt sauce recipe is in the descriptive paragraph at the top of the recipe (click "more").

Not strictly a review, but I think that it would go with Tzatziki sauce.

The dipping sauce looks like a yogurt sauce. Try making this easy Indian Raita Recipe: 2 c. Plain yogurt; 1 Cucumber, chopped; 1/2 c chopped onion, 1/2 c. chopped tomato; 1/4 c. cilantro, finely chopped. Mix together, you can add water for consistency preferred. Salt and pepper to taste.

The recipe sounds delicious and will certainly try it. However, the recipe for the dipping sauces is missing. Does anyone know, what the dipping sauce is suppose to be...? Thanks!
