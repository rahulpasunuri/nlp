This was a hit! The sauce had some really subtle flavors and undertones. I didn't get an overwhelming juniper flavor. It may have been a little too subtle to go with a steak, but this sauce would be simply awesome over something like asparagus.

My two forks go to the hash browns. They were delicious. As for the steaks and sauce, it tasted too much like gin ( and I like my gin and tonics!)My husband could not eat more than a few bites.

I made this exactly as written and my husband and I both loved it! I was a bit skeptical about the ground juniper berries, but used them because I happened to have a jar in the pantry. They gave a wonderful subtle taste that really made the dish. The sauce was wonderful. I will definitely make this again!

Even though I didn't exactly follow the recipe, this was what my husband called "a keeper." Didn't have juniper berries but used lots of cracked black peppercorns. Didn't have heavy cream but used reduced fat half and half, and I don't think it suffered at all. My only criticism (hence 3 stars instead of 4) is that the potatoes were a bit bland. Next time I would use some roasted garlic and maybe a pinch of cayenne to jazz them up a little.

I made this last night and my wife and I loved it. Next time I am going to try it with small red potatos and add a little roasted garlic.

This was really good and easy to make. Husband and son loved it! Served with a salad.

These hash brwons are really exceptional. They are worth making on their own. I reduced the butter by 1 tablespoon and probably could have reduced it further.
