This is a great cake, and easy to make. I added additional zest and a splash of orange liqueur to the chocolate glaze and skipped the candied oranges (which are a great dessert, but not necessary, since they're really a side decoration to the cake)

I'd like to thank the editors for sharing this amazing recipe with the world. I made this cake last week for Thanksgiving (2011). Blood Oranges aren't in season yet, but Tangelos are so I used them instead. And since blood oranges have that special, unique taste you can't get from any other orange, I decided to wait to make the compote. Let me say I've never been a big chocolate eater, but this cake has changed that. It is the first chocolate cake I have ever really liked. I love Chocolate and Oranges together, they make a brilliant taste, which is why I wanted to make this cake. I read all the reviews and saw where some people had to bake it a little longer. I didn't have a 10" cake pan, just 9" pans. I just evened out the batter for two of the pans and it came out perfectly, right at 50 minutes, the stated baking time. At first I was worried I wouldn't have enough glaze since the cake was going to have to be layered. I had more than enough, there was even some left over! Also, I wanted a little more orange taste in the glaze, so I kept adding fresh juice from the tangelos, a little more Grand Marnier---until I was satisfied. I also put extra zest from the tangelos in the batter. When the cake was finished, I placed curled tangelo peel on top. This cake was very pretty. I highly recommend this. Thanks once again, BA!

This cake was amazingly rich, has a wonderful flavour. Will definitely make it again and again. I made this cake in a bundt pan. I recently found a bundt cake thermometer at Sur La table-worth the price, about 8 dollars. Buy that themometer if you make bundt cakes!

Desperate to enhance my dessert repertoire, I made this for our somewhat-snobbish wine group. Very easy, very impressive looking, very delicious! I bought the 10" pan and had no trouble with baking time. I agree, however, that removing the blood oranges from the syrup and boiling it down a bit is the way to go. I will make this again and again.

I'd really like to give this 3.5 forks. Simple to make and delicious, but not a showstopper for presentation. My springform pan is just over 9" and it took about 65 minutes. I used pink oranges instead of blood oranges and the compote was delicious-- not bitter at all and a really nice complement to the cake.

I baked this in a 10" springform for exactly 50 minutes... came out perfect. I could not find blood oranges so used tangelos instead. They never really "candied" and were a bit bitter, but the sauce was tasty.

I made this cake for Christmas. I had to extend the cooking time 15 minutes because the tester kept coming back with raw batter. Once I felt comfortable that it was done, I removed the cake to cool. The top of the cake had the texture of brownies which was a little confusing to me at first. When I inverted the cake to my cake stand, it was crumbly but I flipped it bottom side up and it looked just fine. The cake was a big hit with my family. When you bite into this dense chocolaty cake, you get small bursts of flavor that hints of oranges. I actually saw some looks of pleasant surprise as my family was eating this cake. I will make it again. I'm sure any flaws to the cakes texture was my doing. Also, I decided not to make the compote because my family probably wouldn't have eaten it, however, they raved over the cake!!

My family loved this cake....the flavor was amazing. I ended up baking it for 60 minutes and the middle was still very gooey and the outside just a bit dry. Any suggestions out there? Perhaps raising the oven temp to 350?

This might have been delicious if I had managed to take it out of the oven at the right moment. I baked it in a 9" spring form pan which it fit well. However the center of the cake was soupy long after the 50 minutes plus the additional 10 minutes I allowed for the smaller pan. Maybe I needed a temperature for doneness rather than a 'wet crumb' description. The taste was fine but the cake was too crusty. I did the compote as well, removing the oranges after 40 minutes and boiling down the syrup which was delicious with the cake.

ok I have to be honest.... I haven;t served this yet. I made it in advance for Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, even the compote. The cake looks awesome and smells even better. The compote does have a slight bitter taste but I can imagine that it will offset the richness of the cake perfectly. I will update after we've eaten it - but I know my rating won't change. The compotetook a lot longer to boil down tho. Oh and I used 70% cacao (lindt) chocolate because it was on special

I made this for our huge Thanksgiving gathering and everyone loved it! I only had a 9 inch pan that I use for cheese cake, so I baked it a bit longer and just kept doing the toothpick test until done. Perfect! The orange compote was another story. I used the suggested alternate to blood oranges, as I couldn't find any. Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly. After taste - testing,(it had an offensive bitter taste!) I opted to warm a jar of orange marmalade instead. It wasn't as pretty, but I added some orange peel curls as a garnish to the top of the cake and it looked and tasted very impressive!
