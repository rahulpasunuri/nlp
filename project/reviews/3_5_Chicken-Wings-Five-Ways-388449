I made this for my Super Bowl party using 3 of the 5 sauces: Sriracha Buffalo, Balsamic Hoisin, and Spicy Coconut Curry. It was OK. The Buffalo sauce was mild and quite greasy, the Balsamic was tasty but not spicy, and the Spicy Coconut was interesting but the least favorite of the party. Apparently Thai flavors aren't at the top of the list on Super Bowl Sunday. Another recipe on this website called "Balsamic Soy-Glazed Chicken Wings" is much better. I agree with the other reviewer that it's better to precook the wings in an oven at 450 F for 20 mins, then finish on the grill just before serving.

Alternative method: Bake chicken at 450 for 20minutes (flip half way through). Finish on the grill circa 5 min a side. Make sauces in large bowls; throw finished chicken in, toss, and serve. Be careful not to overcook chicken.
