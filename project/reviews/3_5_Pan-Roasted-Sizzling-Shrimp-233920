after looking at the reviews, I thought this recipe had potential if there were a few amendments. First I pan roasted the peppers and onion (with out the shrimp) until they were caramelized . Part way through I added minced garlic and shredded ginger, S/P, and cumin. Only at the end I added the shrimp and julianed celery root. The shrimp were not over done, the onions and peppers gave sweet and hot, bite from the ginger and crunch from the celery root. Nice!!

I agree with the reviewer -- a recipe is what you make it. Could not find a fresh Anaheim chile--I used a dried Anaheim chile pepper. Overall, a very good dish over the lime-scented rice.

The dish is very colorful and nice looking, but I have to agree with the others who say this dish is bland. There are a lot of better recipes for shrimp, so I do not really recommend this one unless you don't like a lot of flavor in your dishes. I guess that perhaps the hot sauce did numb my taste buds to the point of me not being able to enjoy the "subtle" flavors of this dish, but it truely is bland.

I've made this three times in the last 2 weeks (once with chicken). It's my new week night favorite. I like the vegetables cooked more and the shrimp just barely cooked through, so I start the peppers, when they are almost done, I add the shrimp.

I'm just not getting all of these reviews about a recipe being bland, not enough spice, etc. Perhaps the hot sauce has numbed your taste buds to the point of not being able to enjoy "subtle" flavors. Any chef will tell you that a recipe is only a guideline to what your taste buds desire. Add/take away as you will. If it's time to serve & not hot enough for you--get out the hot sauce & add until it is. And then it is YOUR receipe. :)

My four forks reflects my changes. It'll be much better if you DON'T stir the shrimp constantly. Put the shrimp in the hot pan and sprinkle with salt and cumin. Let them cook on one side until crisp and beginning to brown. Then turn over and cook the other side. This should be done quickly, on high heat; you don't want to overcook them. Remove shrimp, and do the thing with the peppers and onions. When they're done, return the shrimp and toss for a few minutes and sprinkle with cilantro.

This is a very simple recipe exotic dish for others. The combination of the pepper and the garlic of course gives a buster of flavor.I grew up eating sea food most of my life and this is one of the weekly dishes I grew up with.For the last 20 years I've been in America. I do miss this kind of dishes.Simple a lot of color and very tatesfull.It sure does bring me lots of memories. Thank you very much. Selenia.

Very bland. Very very bland. Even the lime rice was bland.

I made this dish for dinner tonight and thought it was just so-so. I used extra peppers, garlic, onions, and chili peppers to beef it up. I'm not a big fan of cumin and wouldn't add it next time.

While this recipe looks very appealing, it didn't have very much flavor. Recipe doesn't allot enough time to truly roast the peppers or mesh the flavors.

Will make again in a heart beat...easy and delicious. I agree, more onions and pepers make it even better! I also think that it really makes enough for 3 people, if served with the lime rice.

I have made this dish twice and loved it both times. It is really easy and the more peppers and onions you use, the more filling and satisfying. I used Anaheim chilis and extra garlic, served it with the lime flavored rice.
