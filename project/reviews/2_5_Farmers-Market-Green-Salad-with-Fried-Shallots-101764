very basic. asian greens are impossible to find. I used red leaf lettuce and actual radishes. quite good. important to use lots of oil for shallots because you need it to incorporate into the vinegar. very basic, simple, uncomplex recipe.

I have made this salad a number of times using baby spinach. It is delicious and easy
