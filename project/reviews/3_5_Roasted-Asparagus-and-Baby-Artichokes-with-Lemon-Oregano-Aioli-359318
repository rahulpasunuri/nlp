Really tasty and easy!! I only did artichokes, and had to use dried oregano, unfortunately, but the aioli was still really flavorful and perfectly complemented the baby arts. I'm sure it would have been great with asparagus, too. First recipe with baby arts i've done that really preserved the artichoke flavor w/out overwhelming it with other ingredients. Keep a close eye on them in the oven.

I've made this three times now, and it seems like an easy way to make baby artichokes. The preparation technique seems good - you do have to take off all of the darker outer leaves, but the inner ones are quite tender. The aioli is good, not really special but complements the veggies well. Overall, it's tasty and a nice presentation so I suspect we'll be making it again.

The baby artichokes (even with detailed directions) were much too difficult to manage. Mine ended up just leaves, not like the beautiful picture---and I followed the directions exactly!

The minute I saw the picture for this recipe in my Bon Appetit, I couldn't wait to make it, especially since asparagus and baby artichokes are all over our Farmer's Market right now. I usually roast my asparagus, but had not thought to roast baby artichokes- both are delicious (and the cooking time was right on). The aioli was very flavorful- I added an extra garlic clove (we're garlic fiends), but the oregano and lemon were a nice tough. Even my mayo-hating boyfriend loved it!
