I love pie. This is by far my most favorite. I used a quart of fresh blackraspberries and the balance fresh blueberries. It was outstanding. Crust was excellent. Everyone that tried it wanted the recipe.

Am only reviewing this recipe, not rating it, because I cheated: I used a Pillsbury ready crust... Never before stooped so low, but it did allow me to produce a delicious, semi-homemade pie in record time and nobody realized the truth. I will do it again if I need a dessert in no time flat. The filling was assembled in about 3 minutes, I laid the first dough round in the dish, poured in the filling, covered it with the second dough round, crimped the edges, brushed the egg over it and had it in the oven in under 10 minutes total. Brilliant!!

I made this last Friday night, it was the best pie I've ever eaten. I took it to a church dinner as one of the desserts, and people were fighting over getting a slice. Fortunately the person that was monitoring the pie table saved me a piece to take home. This is not a cheap pie to make, but it is sooo worth it!

An excellent summer recipe. Everyone will love it. When I made it, I made two; one of which I ate that night and the other, 2 days later. If you can avoid the temptation, hold off a couple days - it makes the pie even better. I wouldn't change a thing.

so good! the filling has the perfect consistency and sweetness/tartness. i didnt have enough blackberries so i added strawberries and cranberries too. amazing!

All I can say is... YUM! I made a few slight changes: - Reduced cornstarch to 2T - added a bag of frozen, thawed raspberries. (This made the pie a bit tart, which the crowd seemed to love!) - brushed raspberry jelly on bottom of unfilled pie crust and baked for 5 minutes before filling. - reduced cooking time to 35 minutes.

I bake frequently and this is by far the most heavenly pie I've ever made. Admittedly not the easiest crust to manipulate, but the flavor of the crust and filling is perfection. I will be making this many more times.

Like others, we thought this was excellent. The flavor is great and the texture is really dense, which we liked a lot. I struggled a bit with the crust because I made it on a hot day, but it still came out flaky. I'd definitely make again.

My wife makes this most years with berries grown in our town. All I can say is that one is not ready to die until they have tasted this pie. I am ready to go Lord, but not until next summer after berry seaason!

even with storebought crusts, this was amazing. I added a few pats of butter and a tiny dash of nutmeg.

This is absolutely one of the best pies I have ever made!! I make it at the holidays every year, and never go a year without someone calling to make sure it's what I am making. AMAZING!!!

FANTASTIC!! The filling is a perfect consistancy-- not runny, and not gelatinous. Have added it as a staple in my recipe book! I usually substitute the vanilla cream for some vanilla ice cream and get rave reviews.

This was delicious. The crust was great and everyone raved about it. I used more blueberries than black or raspberries, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

One of the best pies I've made, and I've made a lot. I used trans-fat free shortening at room temperature and found the dough to be a little fragile to transfer to the plate (usually I have no trouble with pie crusts - so not sure if it was the recipe, the room-temp shortening, or what). It turned out absolutely fantastic, however, and everyone wanted to know how I made such a great crust! I did put foil over the edges with about 20 minutes left so the edges didn't get too dark.This is also the first time I used a vanilla bean, and the whipped cream turned out to be fantastic as well. All-in-all, a new favorite pie for my neighborhood!

An exceptionally good pie that was extremely popular with everyone who tried it. It's too bad that the fresh berries only converge for a couple weeks in the summer or I'd make it more often.

my only criticism is with the dough. pate brisee is sort of a standard recipe, so maybe my kitchen was just too warm to roll out dough in july, but i had a lot of trouble getting the crust done properly. i wound up adding about a quarter cup more flour and things turned out fine - i had to insist my boyfriend stop eating it after his second piece! i would definitely make this recipe again!

Absolutely wonderful. I used blueberries and black raspberries, so I guess technically it was a two-berry pie. The texture of the filling was just right.

Wonderful pie and very easy. The berries take center stage (as they should)--there were no leftovers!

I used my regular pie pastry recipe (equal amounts butter and shortening) but otherwise made this as written and served with vanilla ice cream at a "dessert and coffee" with neighbors. It got rave reviews. Will definitely make again.

This pie is simple and fantastic. I tried it with home made crust as well as store bought. However, the purchased crust just didn't do this pie justice. The filling is simple enough so that the extra time needed to make the crust is manageable. We served the pie with vanilla ice cream, DELICIOUS! I still get requests to make this pie for get togethers!

So easy & fast to make and delicious! Made it for a summer BBQ and people raved. I used Pillsbury pre-made crusts and they were delicious. Great with homemade vanilla whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

I made this for a Fourth of July BBQ last year and it received rave reviews. It's super easy to make (esp. if you buy the crusts) and tastes delicious.

Absolutely the best pie I've ever made. I received rave reviews for it. Still gooey after 4 hours of cooling, so if you want a neatly sliced pie, stick it in the fridge to firm up.

I loved this recipe. I made it for a dinner party to rave reviews. I added a little blackberry brandy to the vanilla cream. Just enough for subtle flavor.

I made this pie for my family when it first appeared in the magazine. It was WONDERFUL!! Unfortunately, the magazine got thrown out and I never made it again. I stumbled across it by chance on the website and plan to make it on Father's Day. I can't wait!

I agree with all the positive reviews. This pie had just the right amount of tapioca -- enough to hold the filling together without getting goopy. I was conned into making this pie less than a week after my daughter was born, and even under those circumstances, I can honestly say it was worth the effort!

This is the best pie I have ever had!! I brought it to a work function and have received many requests to make it again. Since it is expensive to make, my co-workers bring me the berries and I bring them the finished pie.

I really like the mix of tapioca and cornstarch for thickening better than all of one or the other. I did add 2 Tbs lemon juice (I like it better than just cutting down on the sugar, its a different kind of tartness). I also used 1/4 cup cornstarch, as I don't like my pie runny. It was devoured.

Yummmmmmmmmmy! While expensive to make, it was worth every penny. One of the best fresh fruit pies I've ever eaten and disappeared in no time. I do have to confess that I substituted refrigerated pie dough - still worked beautifully!!!

Rating: 4
This was really great. I used 5T cornstarch and 1/4 cup of flour instead of the tapioca, and also added 1 1/2 T of lemon juice to sharpen the flavor of the berries. I also cheated and used Pillsbury crust (hey, it's fast and reliable for last minute dinner parties). The pie held up like a champ when it was cut into pieces!! The whole thing disappeared in mere minutes when I served it with Breyers vanilla.

I have not tried it. I have only reviewed it. I don't understand the pie directions. How can it be that there is no flour or shortening listed in this recipe? I only read sugar and egg.

I have made this pie now three times and though it is delicious, I have found the crust to be lacking - not as flaky as I would like. I used blueberries and wild blackberries. Great combination.

Rating: 4
Rich tasting and easy to make. I couldn't wait. Ate it hot and very juicy spooned into a bowl. Butter crust withstands juices well. It was better the next day. It set nicely using 5 tablespoon of cornstarch. The flavors had blended and mellowed. My family wants me to make it every summer even if it does have $12 of berries in it.

I have made this receipe a number of times now. It was so well received that I have been asked to bring it to numerous parties, teach others to make it and share the receipe. I've made it with both fresh and frozen berries of all types. If the berries are frozen I drain them well and up the tapioca and cornstarch. I also add a little cinnamon to both the crust and the pie. Crust is flakey and tasty. Work fast and keep your ingredients cold!

Our weather in CT has been such that raspberries are getting moldy on the canes so I was forced to tweak the recipe, since I had already gotten the blueberries and made the pate brisee. I used three cups blueberries but substituted 1 cup dried cherries and 1 cup sliced peaches; I increased the sugar and the tapioca. The crust was wonderful and my husband LOVED the fruit combination. The question is, am I really reviewing this recipe??

this pie was really good. i used just fresh blackberries and a simple pie shell recipe from another book. i also didn't put the sugar on the top on the pie. it still tasted great though.

My wife made this pie for me and it is the BEST I'VE EVER HAD! Even better than her yummy chocolate cream pie! This pie has now become my birthday request. Let's hope she doesn't tweak it...

This was a very quick and easy recipe for an extremely delicious pie -- perfect for the berry season. The berry combination suggested in the recipe was just right -- next time I will try it with strawberries, however. I did not have a special pie dish, but had a regular 9 inch round baking dish (there was enough dough to cover all the sides) -- and it still turned our great!
