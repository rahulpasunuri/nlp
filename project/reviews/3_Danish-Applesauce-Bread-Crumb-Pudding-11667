very good and unbelievably easy. Use up your stale bread - I actually used a bagel and whole wheat tortillas and it was great. Also used peach jam.... Agree something crunchy on top would be nice - nuts or granola.

OK, but not enough to switch from the real Danish tradition from which this adaption stems. Try the real thing: Layer homemade applesauce flavored with cinnamon and lemon peel, crushed macaroon crumbs (meringue-nut type, not coconut) and whipped cream, and garnish with toasted slivered almonds.

Have been making this two or three times a winter for 11 years now! I use homemade applesauce that's cooked with skins on, no sugar, since the fruit is plenty sweet enough. Just love this --

This was a Great thing to make, and really quite easy, even with making your own apple sauce! It was fun making it for the first time with my boyfriend. We decided a sweet topping would be crumbled sugar cone on top. The only down fall is it does get a little mushy later, but it still tastes great!

I made this twice and served it with vanilla sauce or creme fraiche. I made the apple sauce with only a tablespoon of sugar and after 3 minutes simmering put it for 2 seconds in the foodprocessor. It was absolutely delicious both times.

My mom is Danish, and in Denmark they make this using freshly grated apples, alternating layers with and topping the mixture with crumbled crunchy macaroon cookies (which I've had trouble finding in the US). They usually don't add lingonberry jelly (which by the way is more Swedish than Danish, just ask the folks at Ikea). This is a wonderful light dessert to serve after dinner or with afternoon coffee and you don't feel so guilty because, after all, it is a fruit dessert. You can also spike the mixture with a bit of Calvados, apple brandy or whatever.... Kids love it too.

Made this because of an apple surplus in our house and it was very popular. Heated the preserves briefly in the microwave to make them easier to spread. Also, was rushing and used rather chunky bread pieces and it was quite delicious.

i loved this recipe...i did not expect it to come out so well...i was only looking for a way to use up some apples that were going bad...but it was a very pleasant surprise...i substituted seedless raspberry preserves and i added some sliced almonds to the top before baking and would make both changes again...also, i think the next time i will try adding some ground-up oats to the bread crumbs...
