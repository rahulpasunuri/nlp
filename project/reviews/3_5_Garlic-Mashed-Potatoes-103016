Excellent. Didn't miss all the high-calorie ingredients. I thought it was a bit bland as is so I added a spice combo that had garlic, salt & pepper, etc.

I made this for a lactose-intolerant dinner guest, but I would make these again any time for anyone -- delicious!

Wonderful! This is now my go-to potato recipe. We don't miss the butter/cream at all!

Delicious! They were really tasty; no one could tell they didn't have any milk or butter. Be careful to add not too much of the cooking water- I probably only added about a quarter cup.

Made this on Father's Day; this version of mashed potatoes is not as filling as the butter and milk kind. Cut the oil to about 3-1/2 Tbs. and used regular russet potatoes. Served them with "Grilled Marinated London Broil", Gourmet, May 1996, and the sweet slaw from "Grilled Asian Flank Steak with Sweet Slaw", Bon Appetit, June 2008. Both recipes are on this site. DELICIOUS meal, and I would definitely make these potatoes again!! I know that if I had used my electric hand held beater (after mashing them) that I could have gotten the potatoes SUPER light and fluffy. But I was lazy. Don't know how reviewers could say that these taters were flavorless!!!

Very easy to make and turned out wonderful. I really thought the 10 cloves would be too much garlic, but that was not the case.

Very easy and very tasty! I used a lot less oil, and they were still smooth.

A terrific mashed potato dish when you don't want to use butter or cream.

These potatoes were easy and delicious. I added a few bullion cubes to the water as well. Skip all the fat of butter and cream, you won't miss it!

The potatoes were delicious with the garlic. I'm not sure I liked the texture that the olive oil gave to the potatoes so next time I will try this recipe with butter and cream.

This recipe was delicious. Though the pork was somewhat dry, squeezing fresh lemon wages to the meal added both moisture and taste enhancement!

My favourite recipe for garlic mashed potatoes! Very easy to do, healthy and delightful, with a great, fluffy texture. Garlic and extra virgin olive oil are some of my favourite culinary ingredients, and this side dish highlights their best; I did not even miss the butter and milk of regular mashed potatoes recipes. Have received rave reviews from everybody who tried them. This recipe is specially good with roast chicken and gravy.

Even my picky teenagers liked it, although it's definitely a "special dinner" side dish.

very tasty , added 2 tsp butter

The fried garlic gives a nice crunch/flavor. (Don't fry all, did that once which turned my potatoes brown). Use those good olive oils you would have w/ bread, really makes a difference. Love the healthiness of it, which outweighs me missing traditional milk/butter.

I found the texture to be a bit too thin, resembling pureed carrots rather than typically heartier mashed potatoes. To remedy this, I added about a cup and a half of grated mozzarella cheese, which I happened to have on hand. I put the mixture in a gratin dish and topped it with a combination of bread crumbs, dried sage, and grated parmesan. I baked it covered with foil until it was hot, then removed the foil to let the top brown. My family loved the results.

These tasty potatoes teamed up very well with our racks of lamb with wine and port reduction. They were even better the next day. Kids loved them too, as the garlic was not too overpowering. Will definitely make again!

I will never make plain mashed potatoes again! I added natural yoghurt and kept the olive oil to a minimum and it was delicious! (I also cheated a bit and cooked the potatoes and garlic in the microwave -- too easy for words!)

This recipe was very tasty and easy. I especially liked that I could prepare it ahead and reheat it. It was a wonderful complement to our beef tenderloin on Christmas Eve (and the leftovers were great the next night too!)

I needed a mashed potatoe recipe that had no dairy products in them. This not only filled the bill, but were very flavorful and added a great taste to our meal. We had a small amount left that my wife warmed up for lunch two days later. She said they tasted great warmed up and I have to take her word for that as she save none for me.

I have my own garlic mashed potato recipe which we love. This recipe was a great change. We especially liked the sauteed garlic slices. It added an interesting flavor and texture. I boiled the potatoes with the skins and added a little non-fat cream cheese instead of the cooking water and olive oil. Wonderful and low fat too!

These potatoes gave a lot of additional flavor to our Easter dinner. It will be difficult to eat "regular" mashed potatoes again!

Excellent! I used red potatoes and left the skins on, so it was extraordinarily easy. These will be my standard garlic mashed from now on.

Terrible. Flavor is bland as the garlic overpowers the olive oil. I followed the recipe exactly and still had to add milk, butter and salt to get some kind of flavor out of it.
