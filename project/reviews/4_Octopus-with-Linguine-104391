Octopus is one of my favorites to order out but never cooked it myself. I decided to try this recipe. I was very happy with the result. I ended up adding another can of tomatoes to the sauce because it just didn't seem to be enough with all the octopus. I used fresh (not frozen) baby octopus from Whole Foods. I also added more red pepper to make it spicier. I would definitely make it again.

One of my family's favorite... I use canned, precooked octopus which greatly reduces preparation & cooking time... My 3 year old loves it!

Good recipe and quick. I have access to fresh octopus and cooked over four pounds for a thai salad and used the leftovers for this dish. Not rubbery at all. Cooked it in water with lemon grass, ginger, onions and peppercorns for several hours. Used the octopus the day after I cooked it for the linguine recipe. Kept the pieces about 1 inch or more for the simmering part. Worked well.

Someone needs to write an historical novel about the cork-and-octopus discovery.

As one other reviewer mentioned definitely use a wine cork to make it less tough and rubbery. It works if you thaw the octopus in a bowl of water with the wine cork before cooking. And actually, although we can easily get fresh octopus at our fish market, everyone has told me it is best to freeze it first and then thaw it with the wine cork. Supposedly this is the best way to make it tender.

I bought a cooked octopus at the market, but it was not cooked completely. It was difficult to judge how much longer to cook it, and it turned out kind of chewy. Next time I'll get the frozen baby ones. Great flavor though!

Tonight we made a dish very similar to this -- just kicked it up a notch with additional herbs, onions, and kalamata olives. In my reading about octopus we learned from Mario Batali to put wine corks in the water when pre-cooking the octopus, to make it less tough and rubbery. It works!

So easy to make and so delicious. I only had baby octopi which worked out fine. I did put too much red pepper flakes and ended up with spicy sauce however this dish was still very good. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made a half of recipe and this may have caused a small problem with the tomato sauce. I found it started to cook down too much in the recommended 45 minutes. The recipe is a little confusing on amount of tomatoes as a can is usually 14 + or 28 + ounces. Not sure why they put in 35 ounce cans unless they meant to use two 35 ounce cans. None the less the dish was excellant.

Believe it or not I found octopus at Wal-Mart in the seafood section! This turned out excellent. Even my five year old daughter tried it and liked it. I will certainly make this again and again. Easy too!

Definitely calamari (couldn't find octopus & I shop a large asian market) sliced into rings and sauteed while sauce simmered. The canned romas I used were presliced and lightly seasoned. Added whole small button mushrooms to sautee pan with calamari.quick,easy,light,inexpensive. The perfect January pasta dish. Start to finish dinner in 30 minutes.

I would definately use calamari. People are more familiar with this to eat and it would not be as chewy as so when fried.
