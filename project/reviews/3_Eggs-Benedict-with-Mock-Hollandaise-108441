Delicious, but oh the guilt! I've made this twice, the second time I switched out the ham for smoked salmon. Yum.

Good substitute for the real thing: it's far less fussy and there isn't a huge taste difference

Go for an Egg McMuffin, is better...

I made this for my boyfriend at the time  he loved it. He loves Eggs Benedict and its respective hollandaise sauce; however, he cant stomach hollandaise sauce and therefore avoided his favorite breakfast for years. Being the good girlfriend that I am, or er was, I made this and he loved it. He loved it so much its inspired him to make a myriad of other mayonnaise based sauces like aioli sauce from then on. To the other reviewers& duh its not real hollandaise! Make real hollandaise if you want well, er& hollandaise&. Just like mock duck tastes nothing like real duck  its a frame of mind really.

Way too "orangie" in my opinion. It is simple and quick but definitely omit the grated orange peel Or make the real stuff!

Make real Hollandaise. Why go to the trouble of preparing Eggs Benedict? Might as well go get an Egg McMuffin

This is delicious for what it is. I added half the butter, more orange juice, more dijon omitted the orange peel and low fat mayonnaise. My advice is to pretty much tweak it to your taste.

I'm not sure how that sauce can be compared to a hollandaise. Hollandaise is a butter sauce, and this recipe is basically for a flavored mayo. Put in the effort to make a real hollandaise and you will not be disappointed!

Disastrous recipe. Real hollandaise sauce is not difficult to prepare and can even be purchased (though the jarred variety is of lesser quality), and this mayo concoction is by no means an adequate substitute. Take the little bit of extra time to make real hollandaise and your efforts will be rewarded. There are also several simpler "blender hollandaise" recipes out there that are quite tasty too.

This was only ok. If you really love traditional hollandaise you'll be disappointed. This isn't bad...just not the same.

This dish was very easy and the sauce had good flavor. I did add a little hot sauce to the hollandaise to give it an extra little kick.

I did like this recipe, although I do agree that it needs more dijon. Truthfully it tastes somewhat like egg salad. Which if you like egg salad is very good!

Nice & light! Try more dijon in sauce, goat cheese on muffins and fresh spinach instead of ham. Sauce is flaverful so you don't need a lot.

somehow, there's got to be a better mock benedict sauce out there. this one was gloppy, and mayo-ey. not terrible, but sure not fit for company. also, i would be sure to use some ham with strong flavor for this dish. this time i used a mild bistro ham, and it didn't stand out. if anyone knows a better recipe for the sauce, let us know!

The mock hollandaise still tasted mostly like mayo. Put it in the blender and added some butter, cream, an egg yolk, some cayenne pepper, more mustard and a splash of tarragon vinegar and it was okay, but next time will try to make the real thing.
