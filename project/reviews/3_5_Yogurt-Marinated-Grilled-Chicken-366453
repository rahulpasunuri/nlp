This recipe is, as it says, 'truly indestructible'. The breast stays moist and the strong flavors in the marinade really shine through, even after grilling. This is some of the best chicken I've ever had.

Served this with the Tuscan Kale Caesar salad and made 15 new friends! My summer, guest dinners has been decided...

This turned out really really good! I don't have a meat tenderizer, so I (somewhat unsuccessfully) used a can to try to pound out the breasts. Well, they were huge and didn't really get very flat, so the cooking time took a lot longer than the recipe suggested. That said, the flavor of the recipe was excellent. I didn't have garam masala, so I used a hot curry powder instead (2 Tbs), I also added 2 seeded serrano chiles, as well as maybe a teaspoon of cayenne. Really good flavor! Next time I will either a) use a real meat tenderizer to get the meat thinner or b) cut the chicken up for kabobs. I think this marinade would be really good on lamb as well.

This is my son's favourite chicken recipe (he's 17 months old). We use thighs, not breasts, as they're tastier and there's no need to pound them. Really, I can't recommend this recipe highly enough for small children (and their parents).

This is a real keeper. The taste is wonderful and the marinade really makes the chicken stay moist and tender. I have made it several times and have given the recipe to several friends. The yogurt I bought was fat free, but it seemed to make no difference in the recipe. Since most of the marinade is scraped off before cooking, full fat would make only a very small difference in calories. The spices can be tweaked according to your tastes and pantry - I only had a few sprigs of cilantro the second time I made it but saw little taste difference. At least it tasted just as good to us.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I made it as is, but didn't scrape off the marinade before grilling. The chicken was moist and flavorful.

Really easy and so delicious. The chicken maintained moisture even being boneless and skinless. I think next time I'll keep out a little of the marinade to use as a dipping sauce.

We used this recipe on our brand new BBQ (we are novice grillers). The author was correct. This recipe is fool proof. It was great!

This was a solid recipe for grilled chicken, as it turned out moist and flavorful. I wasn't about to search all over town for garam masala and substituted curry powder instead, and got good results.

Like others I thought this was surprisingly blah.. I made it just as written and marinated for 3 plus hours. I will give it another shot upping the spice and marinating over night. Also the recipe makes a very generous amount of marinade for the amount of chicken, so next time I too will save some for dipping

I really enjoyed this - thought the marinade was great and set some aside to serve as a dipping sauce since I wasn't able to marinate the chicken for very long. I might try it with lamb next time, as chicken is one of my least favorite meats, but I do think this is a stellar recipe. (Added a little extra lime for good measure.)

Hmmm. I think this marinade is lacking something although I'm not sure what. I thought it would be much better with all those wonderful spices. Maybe add more? It did help keep the chicken juicy and tender on the grill, though.

This recipe was delicious and simple! I made homemade nan, lentil soup and brown rice for a complete and healthy dinner. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using boneless / skinless thighs and the resutls were great.

Made this as written and it was surprisingly blah. Tried again, upping the garam masala and adding cayenne, but it still lacked a certain oomph. Won't try it a third time.

We loved this recipe and because we couldn't find the Garam Masala we looked online to see what was in it and winged it. We used coriander, bay, cinnamon, mace, anise, and a little clove. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. Plan on making it a company staple

Excellent recipe! I suspect it will become one of our most frequent recipes for grilling.

Easy, flavorful chicken dish. (I also used Greek yogurt). Decided to make this at the last minute so the chicken breasts only marinated for 1 1/2 hours. Nevertheless, the marinade permeated the chicken and it was delicious. It should even be better when marinated overnight!

Made this using Greek Fage (2%) and because I'm not a big fan of cilantro, used parsley and mint instead. I also used both breast and thigh meat. It was delicious and very flavorful and reheated wonderfully the next day. Drank with a nice Alsatian Pinot Gris

Delicious exactly as written. Very flavorful and moist. To the previous reviewer: If you want more heat, you could use a spicier curry.

A good one, even when the cook forgets to add the 1/3 cup olive oil to the marinade. I'm looking to add some heat to this as well as some more savory notes. Any suggestions?
