Fantastic - a bit of work, but worth the effort. No idea why the recipe (from new england) calls for frozen lobster tails - I went with the real deal fresh from Maine - awesome. Used canned crab meet - texture a little off, recommend trying to find real crab or using less from the can. If looking for a crowd pleasing plated app - look no more
