First time making coconut cream pie and it turned out fabulous! I never knew how easy it was to bake or make pies! I got the thumbs up from my loved ones as well as collegues! I will definitely be passing this recipe on!

This was hands-down the hit of the T- giving dessert table! I replaced the whole milk with coconut milk as suggested and used my own crust recipe. It was delicious - should have made more than one.

This has to be the best pie I have ever made! The filling is rich and creamy with just the right amount of coconut-sweetness. Everything was simply heavenly. I did do some slight adjusting though. I wanted to have the pie ready for a potluck I was hosting, but didn't have time to chill it as long as necessary. So I boiled the filling a little longer than suggested to thicken it up more, and then chilled the filling for 15 minutes in the frig and then switched it to the freezer for another 15. I cut down on the recommended all chillings in a similar fashion. This worked wonders and I had the pie ready in a little over 3 hours! It did make the crust hard, but no one seemed to notice.

This was the best coconut pie I ever had. I made it for my boss for Bosses Day and he thought it was the best ever too. I used my own crust but the rest of it was perfection.

Wonderful recipe. I also used the coconut milk, and the flavor and texture is wonderful. This is a keeper, and I will make it again.

I'm not a huge fan of coconut, but my mother loves it. So I decided to make this pie for her. I read the previous reviews and saw that many people substituted the whole milk for coconut milk. Consequently, they enjoyed it! So I gave it a try. I loved the pie! My first time making this, and it came out terrific!

Really tasty pie! Used a little less coconut flakes in the custard, made twice the custard, did a graham craker crust, and added cream of coconut to the cream! It was really delish! Would make again and AM making again right now! Really really good!

I purchased a Tenderflake crust but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out really well. I particularly liked the coconut flavored whipped cream. With the purchased crust, this is a surprisingly easy dessert to make.

Followed suggestions here and used coconut milk instead of whole milk. Made using the chocolate crust from the Cranberry Orange Cheesecake w/ Choc Crust recipe on this site. Delicious. Can't wait to make it again.

This is a perfect coconut cream pie. Simple alterations of omitting the flaked coconut and coconut extract from both filling and topping, and adding sliced bananas and some creme de banana to the filling make a similarly perfect banana cream pie.

I have made this pie before many times, and everyone loves it. I changed it up a bit for a recent Luau party I went to. I ground up graham crackers and mixed in some melted butter then put a little at the bottom of a margarita glass, and then put in a layer of the custard and then the whipped topping with pineapple extract subbed for coconut and then toasted coconut on top. I called it a "Pina Colada Parfait". I will definitely be making again!!!

I followed JoyBugaloo's version of this recipe from her review, and it was awesome (Thanks, Joy)! Definitely the perfect amount of sweetness and the right thickness for this type of pie. I'm not a huge coconut fan either, but this one easily made it to the "make again" list. Great after a summer cookout.

Rating: 4
This is definitely worth trying. It's not too sweet, but has a lot of flavor and is perfect for a hot day. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used a graham cracker crust. I also made 1.5x the filling and substituted coconut milk for whole milk. The pie kept surprisingly well in the fridge for the next day. I just saved some of the toasted coconut and put that on before serving the leftovers, so it would not be soggy from the cream.

Personally, I am NOT a coconut fan, but my best friend and roommate LOVES coconut cream pie, so I made this for her. I cheated and used a refrigerator crust to cut some time off the project, but I'm sure it would be even better with a homemade crust. Nevertheless, my friend said it was the BEST coconut cream pie she's ever had--and she's a connoisseur! Of course, I did make some changes, some on the advice of other reviewers, and some of my own devising. Besides swapping out a pre-fab crust, I made 1 1/2 times the filling, as others recommended, and as they also reported, it perfectly filled a deep-dish pie plate. When I increased the filling, I did not increase the sugar, and I used four whole eggs and five tablespoons of flour. Then I used a can of coconut milk (=1 2/3 C), and the rest whole milk to make a total of 2 1/4 cups. I also added a pinch of salt, and omitted the coconut extract. When the custard had finished cooking, I removed it from the heat and added the vanilla and also a tablespoon of butter. I chilled the filling over an ice bath until it was cold to the touch before putting it into the cooled crust and getting it into the fridge. That REALLY cut down on the time it took to set. I think we cut into it about four hours after I made it, and it was PERFECT. For the whipped cream topping, I used powdered sugar instead of granulated, omitted the coconut extract, and swapped out 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. WHEW! I think that's it. Ok, I realize now that my pie barely resembles the original recipe--tee hee--but it turned out GREAT! Just thought I'd share... http://lindseysluscious.blogspot.com

I poured the filling and topping into a ready-made graham cracker crust. It was a hit for a rooftop summer dinner party with friends! Very creamy and flavorful, but not super sweet.

Made this pie for Mother's Day and everyone enjoyed. Filling was a nice consistancy with lots of coconut flavor. Crust was nice and flaky as well. Was hesitant to stray from my usual pie crust, but glad I did. Will make this again for sure!

This pie gets better the next day. I tried another reviewer's suggestion and made a graham cracker crust. Also, substituted a combination of 1% milk and heavy whipping cream for the custard. Made this in a tart pan because it comes out looking so much prettier. This was delicious and I'm usually not a fan of coconut cream pie. Will definitely make again!

I guess I am in the minority here...I took some other's advice and used coconut milk and thought it was ok. I loved the coconut extract in the whipped cream, that was delicious, but the filling could use some tweaking. I will probably look for another recipe.

In Australia a cream pie is not something you see around much, so not only was this the first cream pie I had made but the first I had eaten! I used coconut milk and couldn't get flaked coconut so added more coconut essence and some desiccated coconut instead. I felt the custard amount is insufficient and was somewhat swamped by the amount of cream, so next time I will at least make 1.5x the amount, and the texture probably wasn't as intended with the desiccated coconut. Nonetheless the pie was delicious and I would definitely make this again!

That's "store-bought CRUST." I used a store-bought crust. That's what I get for not reviewing my review first.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Easy. I used a store-bought because I needed to save time, but the filling was easy and tasty. I used coconut milk, like others' suggestions. I personally thought it was just the right amount of filling and topping. One warning: This is one filling pie. Cut the pieces small. I ate my piece after eating a small salad for dinner and thought I was going to die.

Made this for my fiance for his birthday. The coconut in the filling was still intact after the custard had formed, I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be completely creamy but either way it was delicious, and no one seemed to mind that you could taste/bite into actual coconut flakes in the filling. High fives all around.

Rating: 4
I don't like coconut but loved this pie (as did my friends who like coconut). I followed the suggestions below: I made double the filling (and the pie still wasn't super full) and 1.5 times the topping. For the filling, in place of milk, I used 1 c. coconut milk, 1 c. lite coconut milk, and 1 c. 1% milk. It turned out great. Also, I used the crust from the No-Bake Blueberry Cheesecake with Graham Cracker Crust, which was great! Note: I never really got the filling to "boil" but it had some bubbling for quite some time -- much longer than 4 minutes -- and the pie set up nicely. Maybe it was beginners luck, but I will make it again for sure!

OMG! This is to die for! I increased this by 33% since i use a pie pan that is slightly larger than normal. I also used coconut milk instead of cows milk. Super rich! I used unsweetened coconut in the base and added a touch of regular sugar so it would not be too sweet. Worked out great! Except for the fat issue i would eat this every day LOL ez and yummie

I substituted milk with coconut milk and used a graham crust. It was absolutely fantastic and will become a staple dessert ino ur family for years to come.

Rating: 3
Pretty easy to make...next time I'll try the coconut milk in lieu of regular milk. I also will make a little bit more of the filling--it was a little too shallow for my taste. The crust definitely needed pie weights which I didn't have. Besides a pretty lopsided crust, everything tasted great!

Rating: 4
95% of reviewers would make this again. Absolutely spectacular. Made this with a graham cracker-coconut crust (from coconut cheesecake recipe on this site) and used lite coconut milk instead of milk for the filling. Wasn't too sweet and was really perfect - especially with a sprinkling of coconut rum over top. Enjoy!

Coconut is my son's favourite flavour so I made this pie for his 19th birthday instead of a cake. He said "This is probably the best pie I've ever eaten". Big words from a kid who is going to chef school in the fall! He made us save some for his friends to eat later that night and even the kids who don't like the taste of coconut loved it! The crust came out more like a shortbread than a traditional pie crust but that seemed to be a good thing as far as the kids were concerned. I might use all butter in the crust next rather than half butter and half shortening, next time. Still, for flavour, it's a keeper!

filling was excellent as was the topping. The crust however was not good, would use all butter instead of shorting, i used my owe crust and it was four stars, i left out the extract as well and was sweet enough

My family is just not into coconut, although my husband liked the coconut almond fudge gelato the other night. I made the custard filling with a 14oz can of coconut milk and 1/4 c non fat milk. After cooling it for four hours I spooned it into my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker. After ten minutes I gently drizzled Valrona 70% melted and slightly cooled chocolate. It is even better today. I happen to like ice cream filled with extras so I am in heaven. It would so delish with pecans and sweet german chocolate too.

This pie is amazing.. I was hesitant to make this because it was the first time I made a 'creme' pie filling.. Now I'm not scared to make 'creme' pies anymore.. It wasn't hard to make at all! Make sure you give yourself enough time before you start...

This pie is really exceptional. My family just loved it. I made it exactly as written and it turned out perfect! Not too sweet. If you like your filling a thicker I would recommend increasing as it is on the thin side. But other than that it was wonderful! I will be making it again for them as an Easter request :-)

I made some changes like others - doubled the custard recipe, 1 can coconut milk plus regular milk, graham crust with toasted coconut added to it. The taste was amazing but the custard did not set! I'm pretty sure I cooked it long enough, it got very thick. I chilled it overnight plus a few hours in the crust. I will have to make it next time with more flour perhaps.

This was great with some changes. I replaced half of the milk with Coco Lopez and reduced the amount of sugar in the topping. I also used a graham crust because I prefer it with cream pies. I couldn't stop "sampling" this pie.

The first time I made this I used a frozen bake-yourself crust, and I used a can of Coco Lopez instead of milk for the filling. It was very yummy but way too sweet for me. The next time I used the filling and topping just as written, but used them to fill prebaked puff pastry shells to make individual tarts. My guests (and I) all thought it was TO DIE FOR! You can probably make about 16 tarts using a one pie recipe.

I made some changes on this recipe I use a premade crest from the store. I use coconut milk instead of regular milk I omitted the coconut extract in filling and also I cut down on the coconut to 1 1/4 cups in filling. Also I use 1 pint of heavy whipped cream and I used powdered sugar instead regular sugar for topping. 2/3 cup of toasted coconut was too much so I use about a 1/2 cup and I used vanilla extract in place of coconut extract. With the changes I made to this recipe it was well worth it. By using the coconut milk it had lots of coconut flavor for us who are coconut lovers. My husband said it was very good. I would serve it again and again. In fact it would be the only Coconut Cream pie I would serve.

Pretty good but took a while to finish. Or maybe it was the three sick kids bugging me that made it drag on and on (?!). Anyway, made this for dessert for company just this past monday evening. Everyone said it was great. I think I'd like more of that filling next time. Wonder if I can double that part next time? Anyway, a really nice ending to dinner.

I had to try this pie all. I live in Sheridan, WY. This recipe originates about 15 miles from here. This is the best coconut cream pie I've ever had. Not too coconutty. I also like the fact that the filling plus topping didn't overflow the dish. Will definately make this pie again!!!

I've made this a couple of times for parties. It's easy, and I have received many enthusiastic compliments. I omit the coconut extract (don't have any and keep forgetting to buy), and it was still great. I also used a lot less toasted coconut for the topping -- just enough to garnish. I also cheat and use refrigerator-case pie crust from the store -- heresy, I know, but that's just one of my quirks (I think it's actually pretty good, and it speeds things up quite a bit).

I followed the recipe and the coconut flavor wasn't strong enough. I think using coconut milk and more coconut extract could vastly improve this recipe.

This is a really great recipe. I increased the recipe by about half as others suggested and it perfectly filled a deep-dish pie crust. I made a few changes and they were great. I used 2C coconut milk (pie also known as "heart attack by the slice" but what a way to go!) and 1/2C whole milk. I increased the sugar to 1C. (The other ingredients in the filling were increased by 1/2). I did not add the coconut extract. It came out great with a wonderful coconut flavor. The crust was good but I prefer my other crust recipe.

I made this pie for my mom for mothers day as coconut cream pie is her favorite dessert and she would never make one for herself. I am not very fond of coconut cream pie but I thought this was wonderful. I didn't have time to make the crust so I purchased a very high quality frozen crust and it turned out great. I also increased the filling by half and I think it really needed it. My mother loved it and ate it for breakfast the next morning. She said it was wonderful because not only did it have coconut on top but it is in the filling. Wonderful coconut flavor and I will make this again and hopefully next time around I will have time to make the crust. YUM!!!

I hate to go against the grain, but this just was not as unbelievable as I had expected. The custard didn't taste as creamy as I'd expected; it was almost gummy. However, to be fair all of my dinner guests loved it, so I suppose I'd make it again simply because it got rave reviews from everyone else. Maybe I'm just a bit too picky...or maybe my expectations were too high.

What can I say but, this pie was awesome! Even though my crust came out a little hard (I'm not that great at making pie crusts) it was darn near the best coconut cream pie I've ever had, if I do say so myself!!! Don't be shy to make this for the first time even if you have guests coming - you will have a masterpiece.

This was delicious and so simple. I actually used skim milk instead of whole and it came out delicious, as well as lower in fat. I didn't have coconut or vanilla extract on hand but I used almond extract which gave it a nice flavor. The second time I made it , I skipped the "cream" part and just baked it like a coconut custard pie and it was even better. Not a big fan of whipped cream.

I have made this pie several times including for this year supper bowl party. Everyone always loves it. The crust is very good and if you want to make individual pies you can get 5 small crusts from this recipe. You also may want to make more of the cream filling as prevoius suggested for a fuller pie.

i made this with a purchased graham cracker crust, and without coconut extract, in response to urgent craving requests. really liked the texture of coconut in the pastry cream.. lots of coconut flavor from the crunchy flakes. chilled the whipped cream beaters and bowl and had it topped, served and snarfed in no time.

I made this pie for a party. It was easy to prepare. I wouldn't roll the crust out quite that large next time. It left me with too much overhang that ended up being cut off and discarded. If I attempted to fold under the entire overhang my crust would have been too thick around the edges. Otherwise, the pie was easy preparation & very delicious! A repeater for me!
