Sooo good. Agree with earlier reviewer who wondered whether dissatisfied cooks had used canned broth. My thought exactly. Either that or they skimped on the one hour simmer. I pureed mine to country style rather than city style. (rough versus smooth) because I like the toothiness of the rougher pieces. But for a formal meal, the smoother the better. Thanks, Mr Bourdain

Great winter treat! Used 2 tb spoons of butter, 24 oz of mushrooms and 6 cups of water with chicken broth cube. I also added 5 dry porcino mushrooms. I didn't remove all parsley leafs. And didn't add any salt. 2 of us finished the entire pan in one dinner. Simple and delicious!

You don't need 6 tbsp butter. I used 3 and it was quite rich enough!

When you blend the soup, it may explode all over your kitchen unless you follow the instructions below. The problem is, if the soup is hot, blending releases steam, and the steam will be bottled up by the blender top, which produces an air-tight seal. You will not be able to hold the top down if steam is produced and it will spatter your entire kitchen. There are two solutions to this problem: 1) Wait til the soup cools before blending it 2) Remove the circular part from the middle of the blender top and cover it with a kitchen towel. This will allow the steam to escape and prevent a soup explosion!

We make this soup multiple times a year. It is versatile, blend it smooth for a lighter appetizer/side version or leave it chunkier for a heartier meal (with a warm toasty bread). The sherry really gives it a wonderful depth.

Really easy and super flavorful. I added a few cloves of garlic and the suggested truffle oil at the end and was pleased with the result. Don't know if I'd include the full 2 oz of sherry next time -- I felt it overpowered the subtle flavors the extra-long simmer developed.

I have made this soup time and time again and it always gets RAVE reviews. I follow the directions except I have used baby bella mushrooms and it makes no difference. The quality of the sherry does make a difference and it really makes the soup! So don't eliminate it. I love the fact it is dairy free. So easy too!

Delicious soup! Very filling, too. And I'm not a vey accomplished cook, but I was quite pleased with how it turned out.

Excellent, straight-forward recipe. Sauteeing the onion and mushrooms slowly without browning the onions is key as browning the onion will impart too much onion taste to this mushroom soup. I did add some rehydrated porcini mushrooms from Oregon and the water used for rehydration (be sure to filter the sediments). Then, blended the soup together and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream for sublime deliciousness. You can omit the cream and it will still be good.

Delicious! I made it with vegetable stock. I might use less butter next time -- maybe 4 tbsps -- because it was a little greasy.

as the other reviewers note, this is an easy recipe with delicious results. I altered the mix of mushrooms and added varieties from the farmers market which yielded robust flavor. I don't think all the butter was required, so i didn't include it all. Used good quality sherry and I agree, it did make a difference. Would make this again for just me, family or dinner party.

Excellent recipe. Simple and delicious. FYI- Blender use with hot liquids is much easier if you vent the lid by taking out the center plug and placing a folded towel over the hole. Sounds counterintuitive, however with this method you allow the rapidly heating air that is normally trapped under the lid to safely breathe through the towel. When hot liquid is added to the blender container and then a lid is placed tightly on the blender it does not allow for the rapidly heated air within to escape. Remember heated air expands so it wants to push back up on the lid. Dont fight it&let it out. You still cant just hit the on button. You will still need to pulse the liquid and slowly blend for the safest bet. But you wont have to worry about the lid popping off and hitting the ceiling either.

Really simple. Really delicious. We followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. [Actually, there was one instruction in the recipe that I didn't follow, but that failure was self critiquing... As fans of Anthony Bourdain for the last several years, we assumed that when he said, "Do I have to remind you to do this in stages, with the blender's lid firmly held down, and with the weight of your body keeping that thing from flying off and allowing boiling hot mushroom purée to erupt all over your kitchen?" that it was the usual Bourdain hyperbole. What he really meant, we thought, was "make sure the lid is on tight." But what he really meant was exactly what he said. If you don't take heed, the consequences will be exactly as he described!] But, most importantly, MAKE THE SOUP! You'll like it.

This is the perfect recipe for the non-cook. It is super easy. The blender part is a little tricky just as they said. I got a little burned but not too bad. Only fill the blender halfway because that hot liquid wants to come out. Otherwise, yum! Very delicious. For the sherry I used $12.99 Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry purchased at the supermarket. Perfeito! Enjoy, everyone!

What's even more ridiculous than the simple preparation is the depth of flavor. Used Better Than Bullion: half chicken the other half mushroom and a lovely Lustau sherry. I won't look for another mushroom soup recipe - ever.

This was very tasty. I used half button, half shitake mushrooms and substituted half the chicken stock for mushroom stock. Left out the sherry as I didn't have any, although I'm sure that would have taken it up another notch. I also added a bit of cream to thicken it after it was blended. Very nice soup.

This is the most amazing soup ever. I used mushrooms from a mushroom growing kit I purchased and needed a recipe to use up the great harvest we are getting from it. I added a clove of garlic and left the parsley in instead of removing it before blending. Served this with crusty bread and salad and it was amazing as the sherry really brings out the flavor of every single ingredient.

This was easy and delicious. We used cremini, oyster, and shitake mushrooms equally, and also added some garlic. We added some 1/2 & 1/2 at the very end. When serving, we drizzled more 1/2 & 1/2 and some truffle oil on top. Everyone raved!

Used .88 oz package of Trader Joe's dried wild mushroom medley, soaked in 2 cups hot water, drained, saved the soaking liquid and added the reconstituted mushrooms to 18 oz button mushrooms already in the pot with the onions and butter. Used the mushroom liquid in place of 1/2 of the chicken stock. Wonderful flavor.

This is THE standard for THE BEST as far as mushroom soup goes. I always go for the addition of some wild mushrooms for that extra mushroom flavor and the truffle oil to just send it over the edge in the best way!

Yum! I made this soup tonight and nearly followed recipe with very few changes. I used a 24 ounce basket of crimini (baby bella) mushrooms, as per many reviews calling for more mushrooms. Used pink himalayan salt and fresh ground pepper.I didn't have sherry, so I used a decent brandy (unflavored)instead. I served with a rustic demi baguette with an herb/garlic goat cheese. This started as a very simple, quick recipe to use up mushrooms that I had on hand, but the results became my new favorite soup.

Rating: 3
I have made this soup many times. If you follow the recipe exactly as written it is 3 forks with some minor adjustments it is 4 forks. This time I used 1 bag of Trader Joe's dried mushroom medley, 10 oz button mushrooms and 10 oz of baby bellas. Also added 2 cloves garlic and served with french bread, olives and hard cheeses. It was a hit.

Rating: 3
Good recipe but definitely needs some tweaking. Per other reviews, halved the butter, doubled the mushrooms, for the mushroioms I used porcini's and baby bellas (although you can use whatever blend of mushrooms suit you), and a homemade veggie broth with all green veggies so as not to overwhelm the mushroom flavor. Also, added a sprig of rosemary and two cloves of garlic in addition to the parsley, and finished with a little Oregon Truffle Oil, served with a slice of crusty bread toasted with melted Gruyere, delicious! To those who don't like the color, it's MUSHROOM soup - mushrooms are not colorful (except for the ones you DON'T want to eat!) My suggestion is to add a few sprigs of chervil as a garnish if you want some color.

Okay..but watery with 4c of chicken stock. Either double the mushrooms or halve the mushrooms. Lacked body.

This soup is absolutely delicious and very very easy. I made it with half cremini and half shitake. i only used 1 tbs of butter and added 1tbs of olive oil. would maybe dollop some creme fraiche on top next time if i had some in the fridge for added richness - but i think that the 6tbs of butter that bourdain recommends is just excessive.

Followed the recipe with a mix of crimini and baby bellas, except I used less butter and a higher ratio of mushrooms to broth as suggested by others, and no sherry. For the broth I used Better Than Boullion-Chicken. The result was good but the flavor was more bland than I like. I added 1 oz dry vermouth and some fresh thyme, which improved it, but it still lacked the richer flavor I was after. Then I added a small squirt of Worcesterhsire for Chicken. Better - almost perfect! I wonder if good sherry or the truffle oil would have made the difference. I will make this again - it has potential for greatness.

Rating: 4
A great recipe! It's also very flexible, I use whatever mushrooms are on hand, sometime serve it chunky, sometimes blend it until it's smooth. A drizzle of truffle oil is a nice addition. My kids love it - even the one that doesn't "like" mushrooms - he thinks he's eating truffle soup.

Rating: 4
Simply amazing! Made this many time. This time used baby bella & shitake mushrooms, a rosemary/garlic sauce (came with the mushrooms), 2 cloves of garlic, and about 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth (not home-made). By varying very finely blended portions with "chunkier" portions, it creates a beautiful variety of textures... yum!!!

Wonderful. I made this for company and everyone wanted the recipe. Even my husband, who supposedly doesn't like mushroom said it was really good.

I was looking for a mushroom soup recipe because I had a bunch of Baby Bellas to use up and have had good success with AB recipes so tried this even though I did not have the sherry on hand. Like others, I used the emersion blender but only partially pureed it and liked the texture. It was creamy enough but still had lots of big mushroom pieces which I like. I did reduce the amount of butter but not by much and I used only 1 Tsp of VSOP which gave it a nice taste. This recipe is as promised, easy to make and very rich and flavourful. My guests loved it.

Wow! This soup is great. Based on some of the recommendations, I used 24 oz mushrooms to about 6 cups of chicken stock. I don't own a blender, so I used my food processor to blend in batches. The soup thickened perfectly and the consistency was just right. Such a simple and yummy recipe. Of course, I attribute much of the soup's success to my homemade stock. (I wonder if the people who complained that the soup was tasteless were using canned stock?) Next time, I'm going to try this soup using a homemade mushroom stock.

I made this soup with button and portobello mushrooms I had in the fridge. I also substituted chicken broth with onion soup I made with a mix.

I prefer oilve oil (instead of buttter) for health reasons. This is an OK recipe but I used Shitake, hen- of-the woods, chantrelle, dried shitake and dried chantelles.

I made this soup with mini portabello mushrooms as well as a 1 oz bag of dried mushrooms. I did not include parsley. Also, I used 8oz chicken broth and 24 oz onion broth (from cubes). It turned out great, however, when I added the sherry the taste was a little too strong so I only used 1 oz. Although this soup may not look "pretty", it tastes amazing. I'd recommend adding more mushrooms.

Absolutely fantastic! I used regular open cup mushrooms, made my chicken stock from oxo cubes and used supermarket own label butter. The only changes to the recipe I made were that I used single cream instead of sherry, and I didn't add any salt, pepper or parsley. By using a handheld blender, the soup stayed a little chunky, which just added to the experience! Definitely making this again, maybe next time chunkier, served with croutons, fresh baked bread and a glass of wine.

This soup is amazing! I used 10 oz. button mushrooms and 3.5 oz. shitake mushrooms. When it came time to blend the soup, I only blended about 1/3 to 1/2 and then added the blended mixture back to the rest of the soup. It still had a rich consistency but you could really enjoy the mushrooms and the onions in the soup. It did not need any salt or pepper and I omitted the sherry. I also used a pinch of dried parsley instead of the flat parsley. My husband loved it. Definitely making this one again and sharing the recipe with family and friends.

Same as other reviewers, I mix up the mushrooms. I also reduce the chicken stock to 3 1/2 cups because I like it a bit thicker. Two FYI's from my kitchen. I forgot to pick up Sherry so I substituted VSOP Cognac this time-different than sherry but good. The second thing that I would REALLY recommend is an immersion blender-rather than transferring to a blender, you can just use this in the pot and blend to your desired texture. I also use it for a lot of other dishes; pasta sauces, smoothies etc.

I liked the ease of preparation but next time I would add a more earthy mushroom, add some light cream and cut back on the butter.

This soup is amazingling fragrant and very simple to make. I did substitute a majority of the button mushrooms with portabello mushrooms because I prefer taste of them, and because I didn't have any sherry I omitted it.

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing, but a few changes are imperative. I used portobello mushrooms because I had them on hand, and I allowed the onions to brown to deepen the flavor (and because I knew the portobellos would darken the soup anyway). I did not bother with the sherry since I didn't have any on hand, nor the parsley because my chicken broth was already quite flavorful. I used a hand blender to make the process a bit easier, and allow it to cool so I could de-fat it the next day since my guests prefer lighter foods. Most importantly(!!!), I finished the soup with a few drops of black truffle oil, which was pungently delicious. I also took a baguette, sliced it and topped each slice with some freshly grated parmesean. I melted them in the oven, inevitably making frico alongside the croutons, until the bread was nice and crusty. I put a crouton in each soup (serving as a garnish) and served a plate of extra croutons and frico on the table alongside the soup. The black truffle oil and the parmesean-croutons MADE this soup. It was phenomenal. This is at the top of my list for my next dinner party. Delicious! And FYI: when I say crouton, I do mean baguette slices, not cubes--more like crostini but without brushing them with oil and baking them first.

Exceptional soup for a chilly autumn evening! I chose this recipe strictly on the previous reviews, and followed the directions exactly. For our tastes there's way too much butter, making the soup somewhat greasy and very rich. Chilling it and skimming off the excess butter solved the problem very nicely without affecting the taste one bit. Will definitely make this again, cutting back on the butter, and will experiment with different mixtures of mushrooms. Yum!!!

A very simple yet elegant and complex soup. One way to make it even easier to make is to put the mushrooms and onions in the quisinart before you fry them. That way you don't have to whiz them after the soup is hot.

I made this recipe because I was bored on a Sunday nite and felt like cooking. Since there was no planning I did not have all the listed ingrediants. Since my household is veggie I made a vegetable stock instead of using chicken stock. I used crimini mushrooms instead of white button. I like earthy flavors with my shrooms so I used several herbs from my garden in a herb ball instead of just parsley. And finally, not having even grocery store sherry on hand I used an excellent Marsala that my in-laws brought back from Italy. With all these alterations the recipe came out wonderdul and it was very simple. I look forward to trying this with sherry and some different shrooms. I also will try this with the truffle oil.

Day 1 - excellent, light soup. I blasphemously used grocery store sherry, plus a little white wine. I can't wait to try it on day two and three, and perhaps with the truffle oil.

Nice and simple and good. Used good mushrooms and sherry- makes a big differnece. To the cook from Canada = chopping the mushrroms beforehand is not required as you are going to puree them anyway (I coursly chopped mine). Also, the recipe does not say to saute the oinions and mushrooms it says to sweat them, so you are using too high heat if they are browning.

Can someone explain this recipe? Am I supposed to chop the mushrooms before sauteeing? Also, it is very hard to properly sautee mushrooms (high heat) without browning the onions. Has anyone mastered this? Should I sautee the mushrooms first and then add the onions? Thanks for any pointers!!

Hard to believe such a superb dish from a well-known chef and food critic is just as easy to prepare as he says! Instructions are straight-forward, easy to follow, and (can this be true?) funny! Includes suggestions to "dress it up" that make it plain the cook is delivering a wonderful treat without taking herself too seriously! This soup was so good my guest insisted I give her the recipe on the spot. Fortunately I could do that and print another from Epicurious. Thank you!

Served it as an opener for Christmas Dinner. If you are good with making a garnish do so--as my father said "it looks like dreck!" But there wasn't a drop left over, and I wound up making a second batch the next day for myself! Since my store only carried mushrooms in 8oz containers, I supplemented the buttons with 2 oz of baby bellas and the flavor was amazing.

This mushroom soup was a hit at dinner. It wasn't the best mushroom soup I've ever had, but considering how easy it was to make it deserves 4 forks. One change I would make is add more dried mushrooms at the end, everyone loved finding them in their bowl. You may also want to start with 1 1/2 oz of sherry, as I felt it was a tiny bit too alcoholic for my taste.

My family raved about this. It was great. I followed the recipe, except I left out the parsley (not being a parsley fan). This soup is easy and very tasty.

Very yummy. I made a couple changes though...6 Tbsp of butter seemed like way too much...so I used half that amount and since I didn't have any sherry, I used a dry marsala. I also did not blend the soup. It tasted so good after the hour of cooking and I preferred the idea of having large chunks of mushrooms in a broth. I will definitely make this again and I would even feel comfortable serving it to company.

Great, easy soup for a cold, winter day!! Used 2 squirts of Pam Butter to saute the onions, added a mix of 1 portabella, mostly regular mushrooms, and a bit of dried porcini. It's true, the slow sauting helps to build a deep flavor. I used red wine 'coz I did not have any sherry available and added it about 1/2 an hour into cooking so that the flavor could deepen. Did not end up blenderizing the soup as it tasted so yummy the way it was--broth-based with the sliced mushrooms and onions.
