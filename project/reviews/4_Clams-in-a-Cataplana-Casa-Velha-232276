This dish was fantastic!!! I managed to find new zealand cockles but I think littlenecks would have worked just as well. Next time I might add a bit of clam juice as I did find the sauce to be quite thick but the flavor was out of this world. A great dish for entertaining as you can make the sauce ahead of time and just add clams at last minute.

This was phenomenal! I don't know why more people haven't written about it. Highly recommended.

This was beyond good. I found a good Spanish chorizo that really made it. Bread to soak up the broth is mandatory. The only difference I made was to cook it for less time, after the first 10 minutes my clams were beginning to open so I only simmered it as long as it took for them all to open.

This was fantastic. We absolutely loved it. While it is reminiscent of the Spicy Shellfish Stew found on this website, it went a little further in its heartiness. This dish is a salt lovers dream. I served it with a foccacia I had made, and next time I will leave the sea salt off of it! It didn't need any extra.
