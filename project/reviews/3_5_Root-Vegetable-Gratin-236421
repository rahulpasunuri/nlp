Tastiest veggie roast I've had in some time! I made a cream version and added more stock to another dish for a dairy-free version for xmas dinner - both were equally appreciated by family and guests (esp. my 9-month-old baby, who gobbled it up). A fantastic combo of tastes - will def keep this on the regular roster of dishes.

Really good! I left out the potatoes and used parsnips instead of carrots so that I could use what I had on hand. Delicious and was a hit with my hubby.

My mistake - I tried to cook these on a top rack while the turkey was in the oven. The vegetables, despite how thin they were, took TWO hours to soften. I found the time and effort involved to be far too much for a mediocre result. This is, in fact, the only thing we still have left from thanksgiving dinner. I added some chipotle powder to the cream mixture in the hopes of adding some flavor but I think I shouldn't have been so sparing with it (one thanksgiving I made sweet potatoes in chipotle cream sauce and they were AMAZING so I was trying to recreate that here with a variety of root vegetables). This was a flop.

Pretty good - very simple. But I'm wondering why the picture on this recipe appears to be a stuffing, and not at all similar to root vegetable gratin. Hmmm?

This was great. I used jerusalem artichokes and other root vegetbales I had. I have made it twice already. Great

I increased the chopped garlic to two teaspoons and used vegetable broth. I only used one cup of heavy cream and baked for about 55 minutes. I brought it to a potluck holiday party and it got great reviews. A friend asked for the recipe so she could make it for Christmas. The only drawback is that it takes a lot of time to prepare the vegetables. But it's worth it.

I have made this twice. The first time I made it and served right away and found there did seem to be a lot of cream. The second time I made it a day ahead and then rebaked it for about 30 minutes before serving and found it turned out perfectly--and I received many compliments.

Huge success at a mini-Christmas dinner a week early. I cut the recipe in half but otherwise no changes. Excellent sweet flavor from all the veggies. Lots of compliments--even my father in law wanted the recipe and he doesn't cook!

I made this twice and the 2nd time was not as good as the first. After this experience and looking at the other reviews I think the secret of this is in making it ahead of time and reheating it for 20-30 minutes just before eating. The gratin browns and reduces and the flavors pop. When I made it in one step none of this happened and it was ok but not great. The leftovers were tremendous though.

This is a surprisingly delicious vegetable dish. It seemed a little too simple, but the flavor is excellent. Highly recommended.

Fabulous recipe. I made it the day before, reheated it in a 350 degree oven with 1/4 cup heavy cream on top. The first person who tasted it said "WOW", and this sentiment was seconded by everyone at the table. This recipe is a keeper.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, except that I added carrots as well as a tablespoon of minced fresh rosemary. Nobody loved the texture/ thinness of the sliced veggies. It was also a bit bland even with the garlic and rosemary, just too much cream and not enough of a sauce. I prefer a dish that brings the flavor of the veggies out more - this one kind of subdues it.

This recipe makes a LOT of food, enough to feed very generously the 12 people the recipe states. I tried to use light cream instead of heavy cream to reduce the fat content of the dish, but the cream curdled and the finished dish didn't look appetizing. Maybe using heavy cream as the recipe stated would have prevented the curdling. I added some leeks, thinking that they would add a subtle onion flavor, but they ended up getting lost. I thought there were too many interfering flavors going on in this dish. There is a lot of chopping and peeling to do.

Tried this for a pre-Thanksgiving get-together. Everyone loved it -- it was the first thing gone from the buffet. I did change a few of the vegetables so mine was not technically a purely "root gratin." Used brussel sprouts and butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes and left russet potatoes out as other potatoes were on the menu. Next time I wouldn't use quite so much cream -- it was still a bit liquid even though I cooked it more than an hour. However every bit of that extra cream was eaten so maybe that was a good thing.
