Delicious. This really tasted rich, which was nice, considering there's not much in it. I didn't even have the ice cream--we just ate it as it is. Caramels can be tricky. If you've never tried one before, this one was pretty basic, but they all involve a watchful eye.

I was expecting more of a caramel consistency. This is quite thin. I would prefer fresh peaches in their own juices.

While this was a lovely dish I do have a few comments regarding the recipe. First the entire recipe would serve 4 with no problem. The caramel is nice but you do have to cook it far longer than stated. Finally, you have to cool the peaches for at least 10 mins so the ice cream will not melt too quickly. Great for late summer peaches!

Very good, but quite a chore. Making the caramel is tough enough, but the last stage of cooking is a real pain. If you don't mind a lot of work and baby-sitting over the stove, though, the payoff is excellent. CAUTION: This gets VERY hot!

I thought we'd finally gotten past rude reviews based on personal insult when the reviewer from Boston/NYC/LA withdrew from commenting. Describing another reviewer as 'a moron' is totally unacceptable. Come to think of it ... THIS cook is from NY ! Now, could he/she be the new incarnation of Boston/NYC/LA ? The angry, deprecating tone sure is familiar.

I was looking for a gooey kind-of-thick caramel sauce and what I ended up with was more the cosistency of thin maple syrup. I had used pears instead of peaches as this is the winter time. Not sure if the consistency would have been different with peaches or not. Also, I cooked the melted caramel more like 3 1/2 minutes instead of five because the recipe said "til golden". However, to get more flavor, I would definitely cook it until deep amber in color. It was good, but not what I had had in mind when I started out.

I love peaches and caramel but never thought of putting them together. It was delicious! Make sure the peaches are ripe and sweet.
