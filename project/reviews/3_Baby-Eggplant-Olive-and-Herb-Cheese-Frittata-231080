I followed this recipe exactly but it turned out burnt on the bottom. If I make it again, I would cook or grill the eggplant pieces first and then place them into the pan after pouring in the egg mixture. I agree that the olives and cheese made it salty enough without adding the salt. Also I would probably halve the amount of Boursin used.

This dish was okay but not better than that.

Excellent! Great weekday or brunch meal! I substituted feta cheese for the boursin - still great!

This was tasty, though different from what I expected. I used a regular eggplant, and chevre instead of Boursin. To get the proportions right I had to increase the number of eggs to 6, and I finished it in the broiler for a browned top. Will probably make again.

We loved this recipe !! It was easy and very tasty for a winter's night. I agree with the comments on the salt - no additional amounts are necessary. I too used a regular eggplant, slicing it crosswise into quarter inch slices. I also added an extra egg white to fill the dish more.I will definitely make this again!

This was an excellent dish. There were baby eggplants in my Community Supported Agriculture box this week and they worked perfectly. I used only 1 tablespoon of oil, green olives (not brined), and only 3 tablespoons of cheese (two mixed in with the eggs and one on top). Also, no salt; the recipe didn't need it. We really enjoyed it.

This was really very good. I didn't have that particular kind of cheese, so I just used some mozzarella and parmesan and added my own garlic and herbs. I also added some red onion and drained frozen spinach. Mine took much longer to set in the middle, but that could be because of the changes I made. As far as finding baby eggplants (tiny plum-sized ones), I found them at the Fiesta grocery store.

As an omelets and frittatas lover, let me assure you: this one is a very good one. If baby eggplants are unavailable, use regular eggplants: brush them with olive oil and grill on a grill pan or indoor grill, then proceed with receipe as indicated. Serve with green fresh salad and a crusty French baguette. A glass of beer will make a good companion. Enjoy!

A word of warning if you can't find tiny, fresh baby eggplants--PEEL the eggplants! I was so looking forward to making this; even found baby eggplants in the supermarket, but they must have still been too big (they were the size of a large fist), because even though I made the recipe to the letter, the predominant flavor of this dish was bitter eggplant skin. Yuck! Neither my husband nor I could finish it. I might try a variation of this recipe in the future, peeling and slicing the eggplant first. But as written...I wouldn't make it again.

This was very flavorful although I substituted sliced eggplant for the baby plum eggplant suggested in the recipe. With the salty olives, the additional quarter teaspoon of salt isn't really needed. Excellent!

Watch the salt. With brine-packed olives and packaged cheese, does this receipe really need 1/4 teaspoon of salt added?
