I make this every year, and I never get tired of it. This year for the first time, I couldn't find kumquats, so I sliced a couple of navel oranges very thinkly and cut each slice (peel included) into eighths. It worked fine! I also slighly increase the mustard seeds because they give the chutney such a nice texture.

I make this every year around the holidays -- it is so good! Wish my kumquat selection were better, but really love the flavors in this chutney.

I made this at Thanksgiving. It kept in the refrigerator for a long time--I used the chutney on poultry sandwiches--it was delicious. Here it is February, and I want to make it again just to put on sandwiches or as a relish. Don't change one ingredient!

The recipe is fine as is. Doesn't need vinegar. The acidity from the cranberries and kumquats is all that's needed. The chutney is excellent and incredibly easy to make. Great with poultry!

I made this 2 years ago from the magazine and tried it again now but I think an ingredient has been left out. I added 1/4 cup cider vinegar to provide some liquid to start the boiling. Also, be careful with the hot pepper flakes.

did I miss something? There were no ingredients!
