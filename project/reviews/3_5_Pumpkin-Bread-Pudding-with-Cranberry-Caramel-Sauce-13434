This recipe turned out well, but it wasn't to my liking. That said, everyone else enjoyed it, so I really think it is a matter of personal taste. I don't like flan and the custard with the caramel is very flan-like. But if you do, this turns out very nicely and makes a pretty presentation. The recommendation to line the cake pan with slices ensures a very pretty pudding. A note about the caramel--while I didn't like the flavor on its own, it goes very well with the pudding. So, don't be turned off by its bitter flavor if you taste it before serving it with the pudding.

This has become one of our traditional Thanksgiving desserts. It's fairly easy to make and is utterly delicious. I also make the bread alone frequently as it's perferct for breakfast or snacking, and makes a lovely hostess gift.

Superb. I made this for an early Thanksgiving potluck, and the results far surpassed all other desserts that evening. I used a different pumpkin bread recipe, and it still tasted excellent.

I love bread pudding and thought this sounded great, especially with the great reviews. I did not have any problems making it, but it was only marginal as desserts go. WAY too much work for how good it was.

The cranberry caramel sauce makes this recipe. I didn't know how cranberry and pumpkin would do together. It is wonderful. This is a marvelous alternative to the standard pumpkin pie.

This recipe is awesome--the bread pudding and caramel sauce are wonderful, and for a quick treat, the bread is very, very good all by itself. I make this one at least 4 or 5 times a year.

This was great. It is a great dessert to make ahead and take to a party as it requires little prep to serve and most of it can be made a day ahead. I followed the recipe and included the cranberries and while I didn't like the taste of the cranberry sauce by itself, we all thought it was a great compliment to the pudding.

I used a plain loaf of pumpkin bread, and a bourbon caramel sauce. The bourbon overpowered the cake a little (according to my dad), but otherwise, it was delicious. I will definately make this again.

I made this recipe last Christmas. It was wonderful. My biggest tip would be to follow the make ahead guidelines so that you are not overwhelmed. I used Large Circle Cutters to Cut out Individual Servings and Drizzled the plate with the Sauce! Will be making it for Christmas again!

The cranberry aspect of this did not appeal to me, so I substituted 1 cup of toasted walnuts for the cranberries in the pumpkin bread, and made a plain carmel sauce to go with. It was GREAT. By the way, the recipe generously served 8, not 6. Everyone said they loved this except my husband who said it was too gingery for his taste. I suspect he neglected the carmel sauce, which is a great complement to the ginger.
