A simple and beautiful salad. On a whim I added Star fruit (it was on hand and I needed to use it before it went bad)and some left over "Buddha's Hand" (Citron) zested in. Very exotic for winter in Bois, Id! I served it with Green Chili, Chicken Enchiladas and a side of simple Black Beans. Rave reviews from all the diners, even the kids!

We made this salad with the West Indian rice and beans recipe it was paired with. Although my man and I were both pleasantly surprised by the combination of orange and avocado, we didn't enjoy the salad overall. Neither one of us finished our portion.

A fabulous blend of flavors. There was nothing I felt the need to tweak with this recipe. We served it with My Favorite Mexican Casserole from this website. Great pairing.

I really liked this. Different and refreshing. Not kid friendly and not particularly pretty the way I fixed it (just tossed a bowl) but very tasty and good with the rice recipe. I served with kielbasa which rounded out the meal nicely.

I've made this salad several times since about 2003, and it's always refreshingly delicious.

Was looking for something to do with my jicama, and came across this salad, mainly because I had all the ingredients. It was fantastic! Used more cumin, a bit of garam masala and used sherry vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, followed instructions otherwise. Yummy! Will definitely appear again on this summer's dinner table!

I added Mandarin orange slices instead of oranges to decrease the prep time - yummmmmmmmmm!

Lovely combination of textures and flavors. Needs to be plated before service but can be done beautifully. Use a mandoline for the jicama so you can have perfect matchsticks. Was a nice way to have summery flavors in winter.

Great combination of taste with texture. Serve this as a salad with chicken enchilada's.

Nice idea, but I had to triple the amounts of curry and cumin before it matched my taste. I made this in a bowl (for a potluck) rather than the suggested presentation -- if you do that, make half the normal amount of dressing, or the salad is too liquidy. The 45-minute prep time is a little on the short side -- the oranges take a long time to cut up. That said, it's pretty tasty and has a nice combination of textures.

Very good, and easy. I didn't have curry powder, and substituted cayenne pepper, which gave it a nice flavor.

I thought this salad was incredible. What a combination of flavors and textures. Just right for warm weather and not filling.

This salad tastes great, but removing the skin from each section of orange when you're using three oranges takes way too long at least for my unskilled hands. The dressing is really tasty.
