although this tasted OK, it really didn't taste any different from the wheat pilaf that comes in a box (near East) and the boxed pilaf takes less tim to make.

I made this to accompany roast leg of lamb. It was easy and delicious. I substituted chicken stock for the veggie broth, which added a nice depth of flavor. Overall, the nutty flavor of the bulgur dominated. Next time I'll try it without the couscous to see if it really adds anything to the taste.
