I agree with the cook from Portland below - the frozen artichoke hearts were flavorless and tough (I used the ones from Trader Joes). My family ate it with a brave face but no one said much. I won't make again.

Frozen artichoke hearts at Trader Joe's...$2.99 for 12oz bag. A nice side dish with the lamb burgers. Next time I'll add more garlic and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.

Maybe it was the brand of frozen artichokes (Birds Eye C&W), but they were kind of bitter, a little tough in places, and just kind of bland. Maybe the recipe could do with more garlic. Maybe some lemon? I'm not going to try it again, though. Frozen artichokes are too expensive (almost $5/box!) for their quality. I'd rather have fresh vegetables, anyway.

I simmered 2 cloves garlic (grated on microplane)in 1 TB.olive oil for 5 minutes making sure it didn't brown; added canned drained artichokes; raised heat and cooked until water evaporated and it browned slightly; and added 1 TB chopped parsley. Husband really liked. Great for a busy weeknight dinner.

Taking other reviewers suggestions, I also added extra garlic, parsley, cheese, salt and simmered it in white wine. I still found it to be very bland.

I read all the reviews, and used canned 'chokes drained well. I toasted the garlic in the oil then sauteed the 'chokes til golden. We grated Parmesan on top and loved it! A great alternative to potatoes or other starchy sides. Didnt care about a lot of liquid-just the toasty 'chokes.

This is a good, simple side dish. It is easy to cut in half, which I do since there are only two of us. Goes great with rice pilaf and a grilled chop; what could be an easier week night meal? You can also add butter and serve this over linguini or similar pasta. YUM!

I only had a 12oz bag of artichokes, so I stretched the recipe by adding a celery root, diced and boiled until tender, and some chopped jarred red pepper. Sauteed it all in olive oil and butter, then added some white wine & covered it to simmer until absorbed. Granted, my mother's favorite foods are artichokes and celery, but she said it was the best vegetable dish possible.

It seems as if this recipe is missing ingredients. I used frozen artichokes, as the recipe asked, and did not thaw in a colander, and there was no liquid to simmer. Maybe some white wine or lemon juice would have helped. I added some butter and more olive oil, and once they were nearly done I also added sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts. Still, it was disappointing.

A classic. I use canned artichoke hearts, but kept the rest the same. So good, everyone loves it.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It was mediocre at best. Maybe some white wine would have helped it out.

As one who is not a cook, but willing to experiment in the kitchen....this was fantastic!! Followed the recipe and added to it. After cooking those babies, I breaded them(italian) and covered them with parmesan cheese and baked for another 10 minutes @350.

VERY quick and easy! Made a very nice side dish.

Certainly quick and easy. I had to use canned artichokes, so I think the broth was prob more watery as a result. Seems more like a pasta sauce than a true side dish.

Very good - don't be shy with the garlic!

If you like artichokes, this is a delicious way to make them. I had canned artichokes on hand and it was fine providing you rinse very well to rid that metal taste. You could even increase oil or add butter and chicken stock and serve over linguini. Delicious!

This was so easy and delicious! I had a few cans of artichoke hearts and no ideas and this recipe saved the day. I had also added a few black olives for color contrast, and the taste was incredible.

I love artichokes and garlic together and this was a simple and delicious recipe. But like the reviewer from Virginia, there was no liquid in mine either so it never simmered! But this was my fault because I thawed the frozen artichokes in a colander; I should have left them sealed in their original packaging while they thawed. Then maybe there would have been some liquid in my pan. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this easy and tasty dish and will make it again.

These artichokes tasted good but they were really tough. Maybe some liquid would help, then they could simmer longer and become tender.

This is the kind of dish that shows off the freshness of your ingredients. Even if you use frozen artichoke hearts, your oil should be a great olive oil, your garlic the freshest you can get. That in mind, this is a great Tuscan recipe. I have no idea what the cook from Richmond, VA was talking about...no simmering occurred? Lady, do you know how to cook? These flavors were full of artichoke in their prime.

I was a bit hesitant to make a dish so very heavy on the artichokes but the flavor was complex enough to suit. I used canned (because the grocery was out of frozen) and simmered them a bit without the lid to compensate for the extra moisture. I also added lemon just at the end and I think that made all the different.

What is up? All the reviews were great - the recipe did not work for me - no simmering occurred - and I had to add at least 3 tble of fresh lemon juice and a ton of salt to make it edible. I simply don't understand the rave reviews this received.

I tripled this recipe for a pot luck - that made it awfully garlicky, but wonderful and decadent. I'd definitely make it again but only for a garlic lover (like myself).

I added a bit of fresh lemon juice and canned artichoke hearts, it was delicious.

This is a very easy yet very tasty recipe. I have made this two ways, once as written and once substituting fresh chopped cilantro for the parsley.

It´s very delicious, I prepared it with fetuchines on the side and add parmesan cheese. I´ll do it again¡¡¡
