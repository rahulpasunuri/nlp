Deelish! This was a big hit when served with fresh popovers. I'd say it took about 35 minutes to cook down.

This has become a staple in my house. We use it with pancakes, waffles and I mix it into yogurt. Very easy and delicious.

delicious! took much longer than 7 minutes to reduce, maybe 40 minutes but lovely with the french toast and very good with yogurt or ice cream too!

My family will never go back to bottled syrup after have tried this. I loved that I could make it ahead, although it wasn't as thick as I expected. Nevertheless, it was perfect with the vanilla-maple french toast. We had left over berries, which we came up with multiple uses for, including topping plain angel food cake.

This turned out runnier than I thought - more the consistency of a compote than preserves - but still good. Leftover berries are great served over vanilla ice cream.

Needs more than 7 minutes to reduce, but otherwise a great one!

Wonderful recipe! Loved by all! I used my mother's blueberries and it was great. I didn't have problems with runniness. Was wonderful with the french toast!

Perfect with the french toast recipe, very easy. Next time, I would cook longer as it did turn out runnier than I had hoped.

I usually give our neighbors a homemade treat at Christmas. This year I made this recipe & everybody loved it!
