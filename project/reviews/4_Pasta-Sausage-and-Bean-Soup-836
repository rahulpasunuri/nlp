This is a delicious and simple recipe. A hardy meal soup. I used cannellini beans, sweet italian sausage and i did add in the crushed pepper flakes and mini-shells it it wouldn't overwhelm the soup. I added 1/2 tsp of salt. I could have used a little less salt, but it was perfect and had an excellent flavor. My two year old gobbled it down.

I made this to recipe except I didn't add the pasta. I usually find pasta sucks up too much of the liquid and I like a thinner soup, plus I wanted this soup to stay good for left overs. It was wonderful, really good the next day too. It was really easy to do as well. I definitely would recommend this recipe (and I have!)

Was very good - made a couple changes by using dried Great Northern Beans and used more broth cooking for an hour. Even the kids loved it.

Rating: 4
We thought this was fantastic and was super fast and easy to make. Served alongside homemade focaccia and a salad was amazing. Husband said it would be a great after ski dinner. I would agree with the reviewer about cooking and adding the noodles separately as you need them. While the noodles will soak up broth and give them flavor... it also makes the noodles overcooked and squishy the next day for leftovers.

Very good. I add fresh diced zucchini My kids don't like super spicy so I left out the crushed red pepper but used some hot sausage w/ majority (80% sweet).

Rating: 4
This was delicious. Took the advice of previous reviewers and used spicy Italian sausage (and so left out the red pepper flakes.) Used whole wheat macaroni and low or no salt beans and tomatoes. (There was plenty of salt in the sausage.) Tip - Whole Foods will remove the casings from the sausage, if you ask. Liked the consistency of the pasta and we preferred the thicker soup, so did not add extra broth. For people who substituted other beans for kidney beans - I'm sure that worked fine but the red kidney beans provided a colorful contrast to the orange carrots and the other ingredients. My husband loved this and I'll be putting this one into the regular rotation!

After making this quite a lot I had a comment about advance prep. This reheats well (possibly tastes a little better as spices meld) but it also gets really thick as the pasta absorbs the liquid so it's helpful to have additional (low salt) broth to thin it back to soup consistency. If you're worried about the bland comments in the reviews - using spicy Italian sausage kicks it up a notch.

Rating: 4
This is great! I used cannellini beans, as other reviewers suggested, to make it seem more Italian. I also used kale in place of the macaroni so I wouldn't have to worry about the mushy pasta problem. Wonderful! It's thick, but you can always add more broth if that bothers you.

made this soup with half the sausage and half the macaroni, a little more broth- absolutely delicious! Can't wait to try it tomorrow

This has become a staple in our household. I have found it easier to use a pound of Sweet Italian sausage patties instead of the actual sausages because they don't need to be peeled. I also add a teaspoon of thyme to the herbs. Otherwise, I make it as written. It is quite quick and easy to make. Most of the time is used up in the cooking, not the prep work. My family and I love this recipe!

Too much sausage in this recipe. Used low sodium chicken broth as suggested and it seemed too salty, as the end result.

3.5 forks. Delicious one-pot meal which is tastier than you might think from the ingredient list. I added a parmesan rind during cooking instead of sprinkling cheese on top. I only had 3 sausages on hand, and I upped the carrots a little. Used homemade vegetable broth. This is a very chunky soup, almost more of a stew.

Rating: 4
This soup has become a favorite in our home, especially during the colder months. My family detests the mouthfeel of onions, so I often substitute with onion powder or leave it out all together with no diminishing the excellent flavor of this hearty soup. We always pair it with a crusty bread and my kids can be found using the bread to sop up every remaining drop at the end of the meal.

made this without the chicken broth, so, not really soup, but it was a really tasty one pot meal.

What a wonderful ending for a cold, winter day. I used spicy Italian chicken sausage and the warmth of the soup coupled with the heat of the spice was a delight. Instead of kidney beans (which are too mushy for my palate) I used a can of black beans. I also threw in some summer squash when I added the broth. Of course sprinkled parmesan on at the end. The elbow macaroni swells up the more it sits in the leftovers, but I love that about macaroni in a soup!

Excellent soup. Easy to make with lots of flavor. Time is this soup's friend. Simmering brings out the flavor and the taste just gets better the next day. I like a bit of kick, so I used spicy italian sausage and then left off the crushed red peppers. I would do one or the other unless you like a kick with a kick. I cooked the pasta (orzo) on the side and added it to the bowls when served. Plus I tossed in a couple of zucchini for more vegetable content.

I made this to serve 45 using fresh basil and rosemary which didn't seem to spice it up enough. I added cumin and lemon juice which made it tastey. I also made a vegan version with a mushroom base to which I added cajun seasoning, cumin and lemon juice. We served the soup with homemade cracked wheat bread with honey butter. Very simple recipe and easy to make in large quantities.

We served this to guests at our Super Bowl party this year and it was a hit. Substituted turkey Italian-flavored sausage and white beans as suggested. Boiled and rinsed the pasta separately then added. However, as we kept it in a cock pot all day, the noodles did get mushy, so I might eliminate the pasta if I was going to use a crock pot again. It was a great low-fat entree for folks still following their New Year's resolutions.

Rating: 4
Wow, was this good. Used white beans since I had them on hand but I think you could use any kind of canned beans. I'm sure you could substitute veggie or turkey sausage and use whole-wheat pasta if you wanted to make it healthier. But is is DIVINE the way it is!

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy; I added a chicken breast, diced, as I already had it defrosted. I used rosemary and oregano to flavor; I'm not fond of dried basil or sage; I also added some kale I had in..the thick soup is fabulous...it didn't need the pasta, so lower carbs...try this and you'll add it to your favorites!

Really terrific and easy. We used some cannelloni beans I had cooked for a recipe earlier in the week (White Beans with Squid, Arugula, and Cherry Tomatoes - light and healthy) plus a mixture of hot and sweet sausage. We can't wait to make it again. Frankly, I regret giving some to a friend since there was so much for just two :^)

This is a fabulous soup. I'm not a great soup chef. I served it at a fall girl's night party with salad and french bread and it was a real hit. I'm forwarding the recipe to a friend. The only thing I did different was to add 2 sauteed chicken breasts which the soup didn't really need. I made it the day before so it was better than ever.

This soup is fantastic! It really is the "kitchen sink" recipe - I didn't use celery because I don't like it - instead used some yellow bell pepper that was about to go bad. I also used Trader Joe's chicken sausage and didn't remove the casings because it seemed annoyingly time-intensive. It all turned out wonderful. I also liked it because you don't have to do much prep before starting to cook - while the sausage is cooking, you can dice the onions, carrots, etc. And while the vegetables are cooking and after adding the broth, you could set the table or clean up. At the end of making the soup, I had totally cleaned up and everything was ready to go. I also used whole wheat rotini pasta from Trader Joe's and probably put about 3 cups in...really makes the soup almost a stew. Will absolutely make again!!!

Fantastic and easy. The sum is greater than its parts, I think...the broth was just delicious. The only thing I left out was the dried red pepper, because I'm a wimp. Definitely a new favorite to put in the soup rotation.

The addition of zucchini and yellow squash elevates this soup to something more interesting. Though I haven't tried it, some chopped kale or chard would be good, too. With the additional veggies, switching out the kidney beans for Italian white beans would not only make this soup more healthful, but also more authentically Italian.

I give this recipe a 3.5. The flavors are very simple but very savory. I honestly didn't think this could be so exceptional at first glance. All the ingredients I had in my house! How good could it be? I omitted the pasta. Don't need the carbs. I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce. I added an extra can of beans (I used black). I added about a half of a package of spinach. I had forgotten to strain the fat off the sausages but because I made the soup a day in advance, I was able to strain the fat off before reheating. This kept for 3 days and the flavors definitely intensified over time! I recommend putting it together the night before because of that! Don't worry about the sausages! I used "red wine and cheese" sausages and it came out excellent. My boyfriend loved this and proclaimed it the best I had ever made! I'll make it again just to hear compliments like that!

Rating: 3
This is a great soup recipe. I have made it quite often. I wanted to check out the reviews because I often change or add to the recipe based on what others suggest. I think the addition of red wine sounds great and will do that next time. This is one of those soup recipes that I always find is even better the next day after the flavors meld together.

Delicious!!! I made the following adjustments based on other reviewers recommendations and it turned out excellent! I did not use the carrots, celery or sage and increased the following ingredients: 2T garlic, 2T fresh basil, 6 cups chicken broth, 28 oz diced tomatoes, 2 cans of beans (1 cannellini/1 northern) and 3/4 cup of orzo. The soup was hearty, but not too thick for my taste. I used a mild sausage this time, but might try it with a hot sausage next time. Will definitely make again =)

Excellent winter soup! I made minor mods - used large (28 oz) can Muir Glen org tomatoes, fresh rosemary, and added some Greek oregano. Reduced broth by about 1/2 cup and used white kidney beans. Absolutely wonderful soup. My husband couldn't decide if he liked the liquid or the meaty bits better ;)

AKA the Ski House Soup, by the end of the season, I can do this one from memory. Everyone loves it and spicy turkey sausage works pretty well when the "nothing with eyelashes" eaters are up. Smaller pasta is better.

Yummy! My thankx to other contributors for their suggestions. I used 1/2 proportion each of spicy chorizo and chicken apple sausages (sliced then browned), and added 1/4 red wine, fennel seed, bay leaves, yellow bell pepper, and kale to the existing recipe. I wished I had used 6 cans of chix broth. I servevd it w/crackling buttermilk cornbread (Joy of Cooking). Enjoy, Morna

LOVED this soup - doubled the recipe for a big family movie night, but decided to only use 1 cup of pasta - which was plenty. I did a mix of sausage and roast chicken and it was awesome. Served with a salad and corn bread - perfect comfort meal. Couldn't believe how easy this soup was with the end result being a huge flavor combination and different than your "average" soup. ;)

They really should just call this "kitchen sink soup". You really could throw just about anything you needed to get rid of into it and it would be delicious. I tossed in fresh chopped broccoli, cauliflower, a handful of barley, escarole, and a bay leaf and skipped the celery. Sprinkled with parm at the end and served with whole wheat Tuscan pane bread.

Thanks to all my fellow epicurious members for you great reviews!

I made this recipe again...this time I didn't have rubbed sage OR kidney beans. I used black beans instead...but I rinsed them as well as drained them. I forgot the macaroni, and the soup still came out delicious!! Even my 9 year old and 5 year old LOVED it! (With the chunks of tomatoes in it and everything!). My 9 year old had seconds! And as always...my husbands LOVES when I make this recipe!

We thought this soup was good but not fantastic. I used hot sausage and left out the red pepper and it had plenty of kick. I'll make it again, but with chicken sausage and maybe only 1/2 pound. It has a lot of meat as written. I'd add more veggies, too, like zucchini or chopped spinach. Probably another can of beans and maybe more tomatoes, too. We like our soup pretty thick, so the amount of broth seemed about right to us. It was very easy to make.

This is one our favorite recipes on this site! My fiance and I made this last week, and we already have it on the menu again for this week! I followed the suggestion below ad used Cannelini Kidney Beans (2 cans) as well as used double the amount of Hot Italian Sausage (my fiance complained there was not enough meat the first time around...) I needed to use several Hot House tomatoes we had, so I chopped up 5 and added a two or three tablespoons of sugar to cut the acid. I threw in one zucchini and squash as well as our leftover mushrooms (I was intent on cleaning out the refrigerator before we left for a long weekend...) We also used Rotini pasta as we had it on hand. Simply delicious! Parmesan cheese is a must as it adds a nice salty flavor in the end. YUM!!

There I was at Safeway, drowning in sorrow at their lack of Italian sausage and cursing myself for having to break my vow never to buy SW meat with these strings of oddly-colored, regurgitated, reprocessed tubular animal-by-products, when I suddenly remembered the genius suggestion of another epicurious reviewer: tofurkey sausages! Not only did they have Italian, they likely never saw the inside of a SW butcher shop AND they had like 1/10 of the saturated fat and sodium. Excited and hopeful, I returned home and cooked up my kill. The result? Success for my arteries, disappointment for my meat-coddled tastebuds. Next time I'll give myself the extra 40 mins to get to Trader Joe's. Other than that, the soup is delish. tip: cook and keep the macaroni separate.

Delicious. I made just three changes. I used chunks of sausage instead of crumbling it. And substituted cannelini instead of kidney beans. Kidney beans have a sweetish taste I didn't think would be compatible with this soup. Oh, and I used rigatoni because that's what I had. It was a delicious soup, which I plan to make often.

Great recipe! I used half chicken broth and half duck broth and it ended up very rich. If I were doing it again I might slice the carrots rather than dicing them, and I might consider fresh tomatoes instead of diced, so that the vegetables balance out the sausages a bit more.

I made this soup recently, and it was perfect for a cold winter meal. I think it would be better if the grease from the sausage was drained before adding the veggies. I added a can of black beans, and I think an additional can of diced tomatoes would be good,too. I did add more chicken broth and used campanelle noodles for a more robust meal and nicer presentation. I also added a cup or so of chopped fresh spinach and some chopped fresh parsley. Yum!

Like the previous reviewer, leftovers were scarce! This was delicious and aromatic. I followed the recipe more or less exactly, though I used some fresh rosemary and sage in place of the dry, just becuase I had some handy. With the 5 cups of stock, there was only just enough liquid to go around after all the pasta and vegetables cooked, I would probably add another cup or two next time.

Prepared as directed and it was delicious. In fact just heated up a bowl and it's perfect for a cold, rainy day like today.

ok, made this last night and it was a success. A few modifications -some unavoidable and some for the heck of it. I added one red pepper and one zucchini and less carrots. Instead of italian sausage, I used Aidell's chicken sausage with portobello mushrooms. I used white beans instead of kidney. Then halfway through I realized that we had no tomatoes - canned or otherwise. Oops. So I used half a jar of Paul Newman's pasta sauce.. the socarooni one. Also added two more cups of broth and used Acini de pepe instead of Orzo as some suggested. WOW - this makes for a great hearty soup. The chicken sausage made for a more smoky flavor rather than italian-ish... Definitely will make again and again, especially in the fall!

This is a great, and very flexible soup. Substitutions: I used hot italian turkey sausage, used ditalini instead of elbows, and didn't add any beans because I didn't have any small ones on hand. I also added some chopped fresh kale with the pasta and a tablespoon of tomato paste. The soup needed much more liquid to compensate for what the pasta absorbed (about 2 cups) and even then was still very thick, but thick in a pleasant way. I think next time I might precook the pasta before adding. Even with all those substitutions it came out great... a nice balance of sweet and spicy. I'll definitely make it again.

Outstanding. I slow cooked the sausages in a separate pan until deliciously brown and gooey, and then sliced them. I used part of the hot broth to deglaze the pan (after pouring off the extra fat) and put back in the soup. I added extra hot pepper and a chopped zucchini, which added some beautiful green. Also offered fresh parmesean for topping per suggestions. Served with iceberg lettuce wedges with tomatoes, blue cheese dressing and balsamic reduction (on this site, but no bacon) and fruit and cream for dessert. Lovely dinner--great comfort food.

I repeatedly come back to this soup in the early winter. Always tasty and I can vary it easily to what I have available.

I make a homemade soup every Sunday for my family and this one is tops.

This was really a wonderful, comforting, delicious soup. Perfect for cool fall days. When I make a big pot of soup it's rare that my husband and I actually finish the whole thing, but this one was gone in one evening. I didn't have fresh basil, but I had fresh oregano from the garden and it turned out beautifully. Next time I may add some chopped fresh spinach right at the end for some green color and a few more vitamins.

This soup is wonderful, and wonderfully easy! I make the dish as called for with just a few changes: I add more beans and use cannelini and great northern beans rather than the kidney beans (2-3 cans total). I also use a half cup of uncooked orzo rather than the mac. Since I add more beans, I add extra chicken broth once the orzo has plumped up, but it is still good and stick-to-your-ribs thick and delicious. I use an excellent chicken italian sausage (DiLuigi's) from our local supermarket and recommend using a chicken sausage if at all possible. This recipe doubles well. My thanks to all the reviewers whose tips have been so helpful to me in customizing this recipe!

Wonderful, easy, quick recipe! I wasn't going to cook last night, I was tired, but I was scanning sausage recipes for inspiration and came across this one. Took about 15 minutes to get started; I let it simmer for 1/2 hour, threw in Barillo Plus whole grain macaroni, another 10 minutes and dinner was done. We both had seconds. The broth alone was wonderful. My rosemary was old so I threw in some Herbes de Provence in its place. I added the beans at the end (used Roman, aka cranberry beans--pintos would work well, too) so as not to get all mushy. Definitely a keeper.

I made this with a few of the other reviewers modifications - added a diced potato, added a can of corn, used orzo instead of macaroni, used turkey/apple sausage, used white beans and used boullion instead of canned broth. Kept to the spices exactly as written - this is an excellent and very adaptable soup (can see you could easily and deliciously add or subtract as your pantry & fridge allow) which is even better the next day as lunch and leftovers! Will be making this often to stave off the autumn chill.

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I lightened it a little by using turkey italian sauage (since I'm on Weight Watchers). Also, I added one large cubed potato and used cannalinni beans instead of kidney (which I find off-putting). I will definately make this again. And even if I don't have all of the same ingredients because I get the feeling this recipe is very adaptable.

Very good hearty soup. I used almost twice the amount of broth that the recipe called for as it got very thick, especially after adding the pasta (I used orzo).

Great soup! A cinch to make, with body, and some kick to it (if you use 1 T. of red pepper flakes, like I did!)I liked the proportions of veggies to meat, beans, and pasta. I haven't always liked the Epicurious soups, but this one I'll make again.

This recipe was great and quick! It is a rainy night and the spice in this soup seemed to warm it up. Even my picky family thought it was excellant. I added zuchinni and used great northern beans. Next time I think I will use squash and maybe some spinich at the end.

Hearty, easy, delicious. I did not have celery, so I omitted it. And I used Great Northern beans instead of kidney. I will be making this again. My 4-year-old twins ate it up!

Very simple recipe!! Perfect for a cold and busy afternoon. I skipped the simmer for 20 minutes and added the pasta. Also I used penne pasta, used 1 can of tomato sauce in place of the tomatoes,cannellini beans, and beef broth instead. It was great!

Delish dish for a cool or rainy night. I made the recipe as directed, but added a variety of beans, not just kidney beans. My nieces loved it!

Delicious and easy. I made this dish for a potluck at work and ran out before everybody had a chance to sample it. My co-workers wanted me to go home and make some more. Thumps up on this recipe.

Wonderful and simple soup. We used two cans white northern beans instead of kidney, used bulk spicy sausage instead of links and changed the elbow mac to orzo. With fresh parmesan cheese, this is terrific.

A great basic soup! It gives you lots of options for extra ingredients. I would definitely use fresh herbs (and be liberal with them). Even better the next day.

Fabulous & fast, made 8 big sized bowls...was a hit even with 2 of us that aren't big sausage fans. Leftovers kept extremely well for 3 days, even with the pasta in it. I used spicy turkey sausage & left out the rosemary. Will definitely make again this winter.

Like others who have reviewed this soup, I found it highly changeable. I used sage sausage, since I had some and that was why I was looking for a sausage recipe in the first place. I used a can of both light kidney and great northern beans. I added some red wine late in the process. I used a different type of pasta. And it was fabulous! Try it and make it your own way!

Big Hit at our house. We changed the recipe a little bit. We used Chorizo sausage, red beans (for their softer shell texture), little sugar in the tomatoes, and small shell pasta. Really delicious.

Even better the second day. I added a second can of beans (mashed) to make the soup a little thicker and added more crushed red pepper for some heat. This is much better than chicken soup for the common cold!!!!

This was a big hit in my house tonight! I had 5 wild little 7 yr. old boys who ate it all up! I substituted cannellini beans instead of kidney, added extra broth and used ditallini instead of the elbows, (which I cooked separately and then added). I probably also used much more than a pound of sausage. Great flavor and the mothers of the boys loved it too! I also used fresh rosemary, since I had some. Will make again!

This soup is fantastic! I took the advice of an earlier reviewer who said she/he used tortellini in place of the elbow macaroni, since I was out of elbow macaroni and that sounded like a good substitute. It was. (I used dried tortellini.) I just sliced my Italian sausage into rounds before frying it. I also added a couple tsps. sugar, since I usually do that with tomatoes. I will add this recipe to my favorites.

I've made this several times now, and it is always a hit with my family. I would encourage anyone to try this..you'll love it.

didn't anyone find this slightly acidic in taste? i agree it was a very nice soup. at the end i added a couple of tsp. of creamy peanut butter to sweeten it slightly. would make it again.

Fantastic hearty soup with a great herb combo. It reminded us of an Italian version of one of our favorite Albondigas soups. I used hot Italian sausage and the soup was very spicy - just the way we like it. Substituted cannellini beas for the kidney and used only 3/4 cup of elbows. I would consider low sodium broth next time as it was a bit too salty and the suggestions to add some zucchini or yellow squash seem right on.

I make this all the time. I find it much tastier with the use of low salt beef broth over the chicken.

Very tasty! I was pleased with how much flavor the soup had. I didn't have any carrots so I used chopped zucchini instead and I also substituted tortellini for the macaroni. I will make this again.

This soup is great! I used some zucchini chopped in place of some of the onion and a little less macaroni. I have made it with Italian turkey sausage also.

Great! A very hearty soup, perfect for cold weather. I made this for New Year's and it was a hit with our family.

Very tasty. I enjoyed the ease with which the recipe is prepared and the blend of ingredients as to the taste and texture. I would definately prepare it again.

I used hot sausage to liven it up. GREAT! My only caution would be to watch how much pasta you put in. I put in a cup as suggested and it seemed to be to much, so the next time I cooked it seperatly and spooned in what I felt was the right amount.

Terrific and easy to make after work. Since I've made it primarily in the Winter, I've substituted basil that I had frozen in ice cube trays (mixed with olive oil). This recipe has always been well received by family and friends.

Very nice cold weather soup, using the last of the fresh sage and rosemary from my garden, and frozen food-processed basil from the freezer.
