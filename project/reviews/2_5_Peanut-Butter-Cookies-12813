Followed recipe except used creamy peanut butter. I thought I overbaked my last batch, and I liked those the best. They were a bit crunchier than the earlier batches. But I like my pb cookies crunchy, like Mom used to make, not chewy. They are just a touch on the dry side.

Fabulous. Today we made two different peanut butter cookies and had a taste test (the other recipe had 1/2 cup each butter, brown sugar, sugar and peanut butter.) We delivered a half- dozen of each to friends and family, and the votes were even: if you like drier and more peanutty cookies that have a short- bread like consistency this is your cookie. If you like a sweeter, chewier cookie with less peanutty flavor go with the other recipe. Make sure you turn to oven down to 375 for this recipe, though, 400 is too high, and these are so rich you might want to make them small.

I think your recipe was very helpful. I made it how you had it, but added crisco.(Had to use what I had). Then I noticed they did fall apart after I brang them out. (my bad), So I let them cool off. They were awesome!! But, being pregnant I had to add another egg. But, thanks for your recipte. I will use it all the time. :)

My son (16) made these. He said he had to throw them out because they were too dry. I said, "Did you read the reviews, what did they say?" He hadn't read the reviews. I did, and I informed him that other cooks had same issues. These reviews are really priceless and enhance the value of this site.

I might make this recipe again. It was really quick and easy. The dough was a little dry. I used crisco - I might try butter next time

I have to agree that the cookies came out very dry.

Not sure why this recipe got the bad rap below. I also would make these again - turned out just fine and were not dry at all.

These cookies were really good. I was a little apprehensive because of all the comments about them being dry, so did as someone else suggested- I used 2/3 c peanut butter and 2 Tbs milk. They were great right out of the oven, but were also good after they cooled.

So dry it was just a waste of ingredients.

The first time I made it, everyone ate them but not with enthusiasm. I added more peanut butter and two T more flour and added a few dashes of ginger. They went faster then. Excellent base recipe for those who like to experiment abit.

The cookies had a good taste, but they were way too crumbley. I did use butter instead of shortening. That may have changed the texture.

Quite dry, even after reducing baking time to 5-6 minutes.

these cookies were very dry and too much peanut butter taste. I would suggest using 2 TLBS milk and 3/4 cup peanut butter.I also baked for 7 min.at 400

Delicious--strong peanut butter taste. Although, it seems that they burn rather easily. I would advise setting your timer for 7 minutes and then watching the cookies until they're done.

These cookies are divine! They are the only peanut butter cookies I will ever make again.

Very good recipe! I made it with 150 ml of peanut butter chips and 50 ml of chocolate chips they were amazing. This recipe is a keeper.
