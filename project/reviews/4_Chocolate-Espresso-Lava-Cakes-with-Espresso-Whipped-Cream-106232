This is delicious & simple to make. The best part is being able put them together ahead of time, then pop them in the oven when you sit down to dinner, and a fresh, hot, decadent desert is ready for guests.

YUM! I made this recipe for a family Cupcake Wars and won for overall taste and overall cupcake!!! The whipped cream stole the show with it's subtle flavor and immense creaminess. I only have a few comments which is why I'm giving it a 3. It isn't a lava cake, there was nothing gooey and moist on the inside but I cooked it at the exact temperature for the exact time, I even took it out a little early. I think the time should be closer to 20 minutes because the cake tasted a little dry. And helpful hint, make small peaks with the whipped cream before you add the powdered sugar and espresso powder. Overall great recipe!

Does anybody know where i can get oven safe mugs for this recipe? i would love to make this for christams eve but im having a hard time figuring out if i can put mugs in the oven...

This super easy dessert is a hit every time I make it! Because it is so rich, I halve the portion size (I make 12 servings from the amount of batter the recipe makes), and use about 1 heaping tsp of chocolate chips in each ramekin.

Rating: 3
This is a good base recipe but definitely not the best tasting or easiest to make...for those of you who are experienced with ramekins, mugs are a whole different story - I found it really difficult to gauge temperature and doneness. I like the mug look but this one takes a bit of experimenting.

Rating: 4
I've made this dessert for dinner parties twice in the last week, exceptional for its ease and tastiness. Preferred it without the chocolate chips ... they seem a little prosaic and they don't melt. Baked them in individual pots. Overbaked the first time, because I just couldn't believe I should take them out when they were still so runny inside. But yes, agree with other reviewers, check frequently after 20 minutes -- there must be a lot of variation in ramekins. Also halves well; doubles well.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!! I've made it several times and everyone loves it! So perfect for when you need that Chocolate fix! YUM

Rating: 4
Like the previous reviewer, I've made this many times and it is a family favorite. I like it because it has a high percentage of chocolate (always a plus) and because it can be made ahead of time and popped into the oven when dinner starts. I consider the espresso powder to be optional. I don't miss it and some of the non-coffee drinkers would rather do without the caffeine. It also makes a great bundt cake. |My bundt pan is large, so I make 1-1/2 recipes and lay out the chocolate pieces in a ring in the center. If it comes out dry, it was over-baked. The cake is supposed to collapse a bit. A knife should come out clean if you avoid the chocolate "lava".

Rating: 4
I've made this countless times - definitely a rockstar dessert! VERY rich, so be sure to warn your guests that they don't have to eat the whole thing! Super easy to make ahead - then either make the whipped cream just prior to serving or cheat and use cool whip. Enjoy!

I made these for a Christmas party. Everyone loved them! I doubled the recipe and divided it up between 12 mugs. I bought some cheap mugs at walmart that were only microwave safe and they worked just fine. They look runny when they're cooking, but they do set up a little more after you take them out of the oven. Whip cream topping is great. I reduced the amount of sugar it suggested. Vanilla ice cream is great too. Will definetly make these again and again!

Rating: 3
i've made these twice now, and both times the flavor was heavenly but lava inside was minimal, and then vanished very quickly into fully-cooked cake! definitely check at 20 minutes, and you don't really need that 5-minute cooldown (or just let it cool down for a minute in front of eager guest with spoon in hand). i did use mugs that taper toward the bottom, and we hypothesized that that may have been the issue with overcooking. i should have read the reviews beforehand--far better to use smaller portions in ramekins and adjust baking time accordingly. decaf's a great idea, too! but i do plan on trying out this recipe until i reach the holy grail of lava center.

This is fabulous. Thought I lost recipe and was so sad. We think this recipe is better than Chocolate Melting Cakes from Carnival Cruise Lines.

This is a VERY easy, VERY chocolatey YUMMY dessert. I cut the recipe in half for our family, and made four coffee mugs. I whipped it together while making dinner, (used instant coffee powder, not espresso) left it in the fridge while we ate, then baked it while we cleaned up. Everyone was waiting expectantly for the presentation! The responses were that the almond flavouring was a little too strong, otherwise DELICIOUS!!! I watched the cooking time, less that 30 minutes, and served with fresh raspberries as well. A keeper!!

I made these for my mother and me on valentines day. We were both feeling a little depressed as my dad was working and I didn't have a date. There is nothing like a little chocolate to cheer you up! The previous reviewer mentioned a lack of molten center. Mine came out with a perfect ratio of batter to cake. The espresso flavor was very distinct, unlike the many other mocha recipes out there. However, if you don't want to curse your guests with a permanent coffee addiction, use decaf. I was a little skeptical of the almond extract, at the time I thought it might add an unnecessary flavor. It was divine and only enhanced the chocolate and coffee. I baked them in 8 ramekins and served them with ice cream (the whipped cream is good, but you really need the cold/ hot combination). When warmed in the microwave the next day, the center comes out still very gooey.The best molten cake recipe out there! Knock yourself out!

I have tried every lava cake recipe here as my everyone is a big fan of them but I was disappinted with these... The espresso- choc taste is divine but there was no lava- th ebest part!!! I cut the granulated sugar in half, which was just right. I made 7 servings but next time I will cut the portions still further and bake for 10-15 mins like most of the other lava cake recipes.

Rating: 4
I've made this a few times, and contrary to a previous comment, I only make 4 servings using some oven-proof mugs. The presentation is great: the cakes begin to "pour" over the edge a little (I bake with a cookie sheet below them to cake the drips). I also prefer to let them sit a little and serve it with icecream (Javachip is great).

Holy gods this is delicious. Though, 6 is too few servings. 8 is too few servings -- they spilled over my ramekins. This could very happily be split up into more servings still. Maybe as many as 16.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of all the desserts. People were ready with spoon in hand at the table for it to come out of the oven. I cut the sugar by about 1/4 c. and noticed no difference at all. I also made 8 servings and still could have reduced the portion size. They are soo rich! I will cut the amount of chocolate chips down to 1 T. instead of 2 next time but the espresso whipped cream is a must!

Rating: 4
This dessert is to die for! I've made it many times for guests and have always received rave reviews. One mug is too rich for most people, so I make them in small ramekins instead which serves 8-10 people. It's easy to make these the day before you have company and just pop in the oven when dinner is finished. You must try this recipe!

Rating: 4
Wonderful. I would make 8 smaller servings as they are large.

Rating: 3
The first time I made these they were perfect. The last time I made them only two of the six cakes were cooked enough. I'm not sure what the problem was - cooking time or temperature. I let them sit the 5 minutes out of the frig and another 5 minutes out of the oven. I can vouch, though, that when they work, they are really, really good. (Even without the coffee/espresso, which I have omitted in the past.)

Impressive looking dessert and easy to make. Wouldn't recommend trying it if you're in a rush though. I left out the almond extract and espresso and I still loved the flavor. I followed the suggested cooking time of 30 minutes, and it was much too long. Keep a close eye on it in the oven or you lose the lava - the best part! Also tasty with ice cream on top.

Rating: 4
Wonderfully rich! These were dinner party worthy and well received. I used Dutch processed cocoa and Scharffen Berger semi-sweet chocolate which I chopped to the size of chocolate chips. To die for! My espresso flavor wasn't as strong, I only found General Foods' Cappuccino powder so that may be the reason. Overall, loved it. A 6oz ramekin would have been plenty of this rich dessert. I baked 25 minutes and got the right lava consistency. I used a toothpick on the outside edge of the cakes to test and removed the cakes when the toothpick came out clean. Yum.

Rating: 4
Such a quick and easy recipie, very convenient and great for entertaining. I actually cut the whole recipie in half and put it in 6 four ounce ramekins, and it was a perfect serving amount. Also left out the almond extract and didn't notice any loss of flavor! Definitely worth trying.

Wow! Made this for dessert for Easter for my chocolate loving family and it was a huge hit. I followed the cake recipe exactly, and topped with vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again!

Very very good recipe and so easy to make with guests because the batter is done ahead of time. Make sure to pull the ramekins/mugs out of the fridge ahead of time or it will really affect cooking time. I served it with caramel frozen yogurt instead of the whipped cream, and in that case, I would add a bit more espresso powder to the batter for a distinct flavor. Excellent and easy.

Our daughter begged him to make this dessert again tonight and even offered to take on additional chores in an attempt of bribery. Seriously, this dessert is tremendous!

This is a fabulous recipe, and it always impresses guests. This is one that looks much more difficult to make than it actually is. I made one mistake - I put fresh raspberries on the top of the whipped cream for a pretty garnish - as soon as they touched the warm chocolate, they became jam, then the smooth chocolate was full of raspberry seeds!

This was delicious - my whole family loved it, even my husband who doesn't like coffee at all (but adores raw dough). I cooked them for 25 minutes in 6 oz ramekins; next time I would cook them for 30 minutes to firm them up a little more. Too bad this recipe is so horribly bad for you (a quarter stick of butter in each 6 oz cake!), otherwise I would make it all the time.

Please help, what did I do wrong? the lava cakes imploded. The taste was really good, the cream was awesome but I was disappointed with the outcome. I agree with a cook who suggested reducing the cooking time, I have a professional restaurant gas oven, so 20 minutes is enough but the souffle-look collapsed within seconds. Any suggestions out there?

Rating: 3
I made dessert for my family of unrealistically picky eaters, and all of them loved it. Of course they didn't tell me that, but all the oven-proof mugs were empty!! The best part was the espresso cream. I used instant hazelnut coffee and added a bit extra to the cream, which worked REALLY well. My only problem was that I think I over-cooked them, because there was no "explosion" of chocolate. I was too nervous to take them out of the oven, I guess. I should have just risked it. Make these - You won't be dissapointed. Any advice about my lack of an "explosion?"

Rating: 4
I made this for my family for Mothers Day and everyone loved it! The only suggestion i would make is instead of using the coffee powder, replace it with the same amount of the cocoa powder. This makes it perfectly chocolately especially considering i am not a huge coffee flavor fan and neither are most kids. I am making this again for my boyfriend for his birthday dinner because it was such a hit! Its quick, easy, and delicious!

Being a chocolate lover,I absolutley adored these cakes! They were so moist and delicious. I loved the way they chocolate erupted in the center. I have never tasted anything so wonderful. This beats any other chocolate recipe your'll ever try, and it sure satisfies cravings! And the espresso whip cream is the perfect touch. It juts makes the cakes all the better. And I thought they couldn't get any more scrumptios!This is by far my favorite recipe, that I will make again and again! I highly, highly, highly reccomend these!

Made this this evening. I'm a hero with my husband and son. This desert will be on our Easter menu next week. Absolutely the easiest recipe with results that will have your guests raving. I made 3 of these in 16 0z souffle dishes so they were huge. We three shared one. They cooked in 34 minutes. I checked cooking time with a toothpick inserted in the "cake" part about an inch from the side. I removed the cakes when the toothpick came out clean and they were cooked to perfection. I agree with leaving out the almond flavoring. My husband and son could not taste the almond, but I could, and could really see no need for it. We had these plain, with just a little confec. sugar but, next week it will be with ice cream !!! Also, I was thinking of using a chocolate truffle or a favorite chocolate candy for the lava instead of the chips.

This was one of the best dessets I have EVER made. My boyfriend's immdeiate response was that it was the best dessert he had ever had. And this from a man that is a wine salesman and spends at least 2 nights a week at some of the best restraunts in Boston and New England. Since I made this on Valentine's Day I have had requests for it on 4 occasions. Major hit. Everyone who has tried has either deemed me a goddess or they beg for the recipe. The only thing I tinkered w/ was adding some Kahlua in place of the almond and cutting back on the coffee, just to 1/2 of what it asked for.

This has long been a favorite. It garners rave reviews every time I make it. I even have frinds drive in from other states at the promise of the richest, most wonderful chocolate dessert ever made! And since you can make it in mugs it's all the better! I tend to get 8 mugs worth out of the recipe. Just cut the time down a little. It's so rich you can just finish it between 8 people. Definately not for the faint of heart!

This was so easy and delicious. I even made it with store brand cocoa and chocolate chips (who knew they'd be out of everything Valentine's Day afternoon?) and it still came out very well. The only thing I'd change next time is to put less sugar in the whipped cream. Everything was so rich that I could have omitted the powdered sugar altogether and it still would have been delicious.

My family and friends loved it! My husband travels and has been able to try desserts in many nice restaurants across the U.S. He has had many similar desserts as this one, and he thought this recipe was far better than any other! Even though it was extremely rich, no one thought that I should tinker with the recipe next time.

Wow! What a decadent dessert! I followed some others suggestions and used only 1/8 tsp. almond extract, and served with ice cream on the side. It was very good, but maybe a little too sweet. For entertaining, this would be a lovely end to a meal; however for a quiet night-valentine treat for me and my honey, it was a little 'over the top.'

I doubled the recipe and put all 12 ramekins in the oven. I decided to increase the time to 35 minutes, since there were so many cups in the oven. Bad idea.

Absolutely FABULOUS! and so easy to make. I love that the batter can be made ahead.

This recipe is going in my "wow the company" file

I served this to company last night and it got RAVE reviews - dramatic presentation as I used oven-proof, white diner mugs (not sure that they were oven-proof, so I made them in a Bain-Marie). Warning: This was hurt-your-teeth sweet and very rich. My friends inhaled there's, but these are people who eat frosting out of a container. Next time, I will cut the sugar content by half for both sugars. And, I will serve smaller portions as it's over-the-top rich (perhaps in oven-proof espresso cups). I used Ghirardelli chocolate powder and chips.

I made the the day before and covered them w/saran wrap, cooked them 24 hours later and they were perfect! I used small ramekins and it was still almost too much as it is so rich. I passed on the whipped cream and served them with vanilla ice cream, fudge sauce and raspberries. These are a keeper!!

I made this recipe last night for our New Year's Eve dessert and it got raves from my guests. I used a "Texas sized" muffin pan to make the individual cakes and they turned out really well. I sprayed the muffin cups with Pam and then dusted them with the cocoa. I couldn't find any instant espresso so I used a flavored instant coffee. Because the coffee was sweetened I used less sugar. I am not a coffee drinker so, I was a little afraid to use it in the recipe, but it was really delicious! The whipped cream was wonderful! The only thing I would do differently is lessen the cooking time. The was really no "lava" to speak of, I was really looking forward to that part!

I needed to serve dessert to 28 for our wine dinner class "graduation"-I tripled this recipe(and still had way too much) and baked them in buttered cupcake-sized muffin tins, filling each tin 2/3 full. I had no trouble getting them out in one piece-I did overcook them a bit so not much "lava" but wow, talk about a chocolate buzz! Tripling the recipe made about 36 muffin size cakes. They presented beautifully on the plate with a chocolate drizzle and some scented whipped cream rather than the sauce. This will be a part of our store repertoire!

This recipe was delicious - and definitely a crowd pleaser. Just to set expectations, it is more like a brownie w/a soft middle than the oozing lava cakes you get @ Roy's.

This rich, chocolatey dessert would go well after a light meal. Very convenient. We used 8-ounce custard cups instead of mugs, cut the recipe in half and threw the cakes together in the morning for dinner for 4. They baked while we ate dinner. Let them cool at least 10-15 minutes, though. At 5 minutes, they'll burn your mouth and the whipped cream turns to liquid. Pass the cold milk to drink with this. Yum!

I've made this twice in the last week. It's awesome, quick and the most full-proof "molten" dessert recipe I've tried yet (just follow the recipe. Don't cook it a second over the prescribed 30 minutes). I omitted the almond extract, used Ghiradelli cocoa and choc chips, and topped it off with organic vanilla ice cream rather than the espresso whipped cream. I beg to differ with a few of the other reviews; it is INCREDIBLY rich, but not sickening sweet. A perfect hearty winter dessert.

I made this for our gourmet group and it was a huge hit. I served it in ramekins rather than coffee mugs, and put a spoonful of the mocha chip ice cream in the warm center before topping it with the whipped cream, delicious!

This was definitely the best chocolate dessert I have ever had. It was rich and tasty right out of the oven. Eating it warm is the best bet. I used homemade whipped cream w/o the esspresso, and it was fabulous! Definitely a keeper!

PHENOMENAL! I love ordering this type of dessert at a restaurant, and have always wanted to make it at home. I include chocolate as my fifth food group, and this dessert is one I will make for the rest of my life! I would leave the espresso powder out of the cream topping in the future -- because I prefer regular sweet whipped cream. YUM!

Excellent--everyone loved it. Made two minor changes left out the expresso in favor of regular instant coffee and used white chocolate chips for color. Going to try adding a few macadamias next time.

UNBELIEVABLE!!! Everyone loves this dessert...saw it on the Today Show weeks ago and have made it many times since...I'm a nursing mother so I leave out the espresso - still delicious!!!

Great recipe - also good cold. I used ovenproof coffee cups and had no problems.

I LOVE this recipe. It's special, very very easy, and I always have the ingredients on hand. I have served it to company and they are so impressed. I don't, however, put instant espresso in the whipped cream, but prefer plain whipped cream.

This recipe also works up beautifully in my 6 section mini bunt cake pan.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious (and I'm not even a huge chocolate fan). It is very rich, but you don't have to eat it all at once. This will definitely show up at a future dinner party. I forgot to make the whipped cream, and I also forgot to put the chocolate chips on top....it was still divine. I didn't have the oven-proof mugs, so I used my miniature spring-form pans and they still turned out fine. There were no eruption problems.

This was easy and very delicious -- I will definitely make it again and again. I also omitted the almond extract and agree that the recipe can be used to make more than 6 servings -- its a rich dessert!

I made these for Valentine's day in 12 oz mugs for couples to share. They were a hit and perfect. I let them stand at room temperature before baking for about 15 minutes.

Decadent & delicious:) I made it with a teaspoon less of espresso and omitted the almond extract. I had no time to make the whipped cream but a scoop of vanilla icecream went really well with it.

I made this yesterday and it was way too sweet and rich. The recipe makes 6 - I think it should make 12. I don't think I would make it again, unless I had to serve that many people. I had problems with them "errupting" as well - but I guess that is why it is called "lava cake".

Overall - we liked it very much. We liked the combination of chocolate, esspresso and the almond extract (I was out of vanilla but I guess it's added value is minor). I found two problems. First it's way too sweet. I'll use less sugar next time. Second, once in the oven it overflowed the cup (even though it was 2/3 full only). I'll be more carefull with that too and fill it up only half way.

What a chocolate rush! If your not a chocaholic don't try this recipe. I used 7oz. ramekins and it was way too rich for one person to eat by themselves. Maybe 4oz. is the right size. Overall, easy to make and I liked that I could make it early. I omitted the espresso too.

This was one of the best desserts I have ever eaten, and it was fairly easy to make. I used 7 oz. ramekins, so I made 7 cakes and used one as a tester. (I had to bake them for about 7 minutes longer than the recipe indicated.) These cakes were even better than those I've had at restaurants!

I can't even begin to explain how good these little cakes are...and the whipped cream is divine. I used larger ramekins because I couldn't find ovenproof mugs. I highly recommend them!!

Wow. This dish was amazing. Instead of baking in mugs, I used my 4 oz. ramekins. It's a good thing this dessert was small, because I was up until 2 a.m. The sugar and cocoa rush was more than my body could handle. Of course, when I returned to work the next day, I shared the recipe with all the cooks I know. The one thing I did differently was I flavored my whipped cream with Grand Marnier. (very decadent) Next time I have a dinner party, this dessert will definitely make an appearance!
