this recipe was wonderful, though I recomend not bothering to actually stuff the onion because the shell is hard to eat and not very flavorful

The onions were really hard to hollow out. The filling was excellent, but the onion shell overpowered it. We cut them open, threw out the shell and fried the filling for breakfast.

Onions can be prepared ahead of time by following preparation steps the night before, up to stuffing the onions. The stuffed onions can then be kept in the refrigerator and baked the following day. Also, using white onions will add a sweetness to the dish while pre-cooked bacon will cut preparation time.
