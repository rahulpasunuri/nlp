Good but not great. Recipe needed more tomatoes - the four I used were not enough and much less olive oil. Better to lightly brush some olive oil on with a pastry brush - one or one and a half tablespoons would have been quite sufficient.

The dough was out of control and ended up being about 4 inches thick. Because of this the cheese and olive oil all pooled together in the center and the whole thing was a disaster. Next time will use dough in traditional pizza form and the dish will hopefully be better.

A simple and easy pizza. Next time I will try fresh oregano instead of basil, or in addition to it, for a variation. I used homegrown tomatos as I had some to use up. One could easily add meat or chicken, but I liked it as is. My (very picky) husband liked it too!
