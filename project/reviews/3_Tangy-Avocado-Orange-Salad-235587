Soooo easy and great healthy taste. I added pine nuts, thinly shaved purple onion, and I used Clementine's - much smaller sections and great tangy taste. I also included a splash of regular balsamic, and goat cheese for those who wanted cheese on their salad. Delicious!!!

Points for ease and fast prep but definetely lacking something. Will make again but only after altering it somewhat. I added the olive oil but it still needed something more. Think I would do an olive oil/white balsamic/s&p/honey mixture for the dressing and maybe also throw in some toasted nuts for a bit of crunch too.

For such a simple salad, this was very tasty, even though I subbed iceberg lettuce and a combo of white wine vinegar and regular balsamic vinegar. Tomorrow night I am going to make this again as a side for "Cheese and Chile Quiche" (also on this site). But, in lieu of lettuce, I am going to try a combo of bagged cabbage coleslaw mix and shredded fresh spinach. Will let you all know how that works.

This is a delightfully easy salad to make with a lot of "tongue" appeal. I've made it as an accompaniment to scallops, chicken and "Tex-Mex" - it's paired quite nicely with all
