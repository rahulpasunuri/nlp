This recipe was excellent. I used smoked turkey in place of the chicken breasts and roasted a fresh pepper in the broiler. Very kid friendly.

Loved it with pork chops roasted under the broiler instead of chicken.

I was "coerced" into making this salad the other day but must admit the results were rather nice. I made the following changes because my orange marmalade was revoltingly sweet - used only 1 T. and the rest a good quality ginger marmalade I happened to have, so I eliminated all the ginger. Added a bit more dijon and 1 t. Vietnamese chili garlic sauce. I ended up marinating this for almost 1 1/2 days also but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. The salad was quite nice and not too sweet, although next time I won't eliminate ALL the ginger. I wouldn't serve this salad to guests, but my children really enjoyed this with some Italian bread on the side and a few glasses of lemonade.

I skipped the Djion mustard and used a 1/4 tsp of finely ground cloves instead. It was just fantastic!

This was an amazing chicken salad! Don't skip this one. I marinated it for 1 1/2 days and saved prep time by using used crushed ginger (paste) from the Indo-Pak store. It's beautiful garnished with orange wedges.

This was an excellent salad and easy to make. I wasn't going to use the roasted red peppers but had a change of heart and was really glad I did. It added a nice flavor I didn't think I would like(I don't like red peppers). I made one change-I grilled out. I really like how simple this was and another shortcut I make rather regularly is using minced ginger in the jar. I've always had good results and I always have it on hand.

The ginger gave it that extract edge.... O.R

I made this dish as an entre for my book club. Everyone loved it. I'm making again, at my boyfriend's request, for a superbowl party this sunday. Only thing that I would caution: make sure that u budget for the substantial amount of time it takes to grate the ginger.

This dish sounded so good and the actual result was kind of blah. I added toasted slivered almonds to give it a little crunch and I think mandarin oranges would have helped too. I thought it was a lot of work for a so-so chicken salad.

Very tasty and simple! My supper club group enjoyed the flavorful salad. Definitely plan to make this again. I found it easier to use the thinly sliced chicken breast. (no need to marinate overnight and cooks very quickly.)

Excellent! Like another reviewer, I substituted apricot preserves, as I had no marmalade. The broiler unit on my oven is not working, so I had to bake the chicken, but next time I'd like to try grilling it. For the lettuce, I used a bag of Dole Mediterranean salad mix (escarole, leaf lettuce, radicchio and endive), the slight bitterness of which nicely complemented the sweetness of the chicken glaze. I served this with garlic bread made with roasted garlic butter. It made a great light warm-weather supper.

I definitely like the sweetness of the marmalade and roasted red bell peppers paired with the kick of the ginger. Well, all right, I didn't use marmalade -- I accidentally grabbed apricot preserves instead.

I cut the chicken in strips before I marinated it but I probably wouldn't do that again because it made it more difficult to cook and I think the chicken would have been more moist leaving it whole and cutting it afterwards. The salad was great. There was nothing left! The only thing was the person who was supposed to bring the bbq didn't so we had to cook it in a convection oven. My husband was in charge of cooking it and he overcrowded the chicken in the oven, preventing the air from circulating, thus not allowing it to brown. It still tasted good, it just didn't look that good.

This was so easy to make, the fresh ginger and garlic gave it a nice little kick. However, I didn't have marmalade (Doh!) and used a small can of cranberry sauce instead. Very delicious!

I didn't realize this dish was from Cafe Navarro...I've eaten there hundreds of times, and it's one of my all-time favorite restaurants!!! I haven't made this yet, but now that I know where it comes from, I can't wait! Glad to see that this wonderful little restaurant is getting the recognition it deserves.

This recipe is a family favorite. Easy for entertaining and always a great hit. It was a delicious part of a new health plan where we lost weight, ate natural (not processed) foods yet didn't sacrifice flavor. Wonderful!

This was an excellent appetizer for our caribbean dinner club. I used Romaine lettuce and baby spinach. It would be a great main course especially in the summer.

After a 12-hour day, I still managed to put together this very simple salad and "wow" my husband. Delicious and healthy.

It's so easy and delicious...I've even marinated it only a few hours and it works!

I have made this recipe many times, it is especially good for last minute dinner guests! I substitute fresh spinach for the mixed greens for extra vitamins.
