Good, but not exceptional. I didn't find the recipe bland, as some others had, but it did seem like the spaetzle lost some of its flavor during the cooking process.

What an interesting dish! The flavors were subtle, rather than bland, as some readers have suggested, but I'll be making this again. Next time, though, I'll be cooking the spaetzle for a bit less time, as to have a firmer "pasta."

I'd make this dish again, and was even craving it today, but unfortunately it's too hot out to even think about it! (Standing over the pot of boiling water, spatula in hand, is much more comforting in the wintertime.)

It was my first attempt making this in December...a lot of effort, but we loved it!

Very bland. I was hoping for a nice change from the standard pea, big disappointment!

this recipe was very disappointing considering the amount of effort that went into making it. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out extremely mediocre and bland. The only saving grace was that I had purchased extra grape tomatoes to throw in to try and overcome the overwhelming chive- ness of the dish. This one will not be repeated, unfortunately.

This is nothing short of amazing! The only change I made was to reduce the margarine by 1/2 at the end. Does anyone know if spaetzle works with using just the egg whites rather than the whole egg?
