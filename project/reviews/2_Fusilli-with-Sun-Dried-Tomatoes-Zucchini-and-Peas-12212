This one's a bit of a mixed bag. I don't think it was awful at all, like some of the other reviewrs, but it definitely isn't amazing either. It took a bit of tweaking to get it to something we enjoyed. I used wholewheat fusilli as that's what we keep in the cupboard and most of the ingredients were on hand already in the kitchen, with was a big plus. I did use some tomato paste to help 'saucify' the pasta and a little fresh parmesan at the end helped, though I don't think it was necessary. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to cook it, but I do think it's a great recipe for a quick and easy dinner or for a pasta salad to take to work.

Extremely so-so. The pea/zucchini combo did not mesh with any of the other ingredients. Cheese would have helped, but I prob would have used so much that it wouldn't be healthy anymore.

I agree with the person from Oakland and the other St. Paulite: The sun-dried tomatoes were overpowering and there was no sauce to hold everything together.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was awful. Nothing really held it together it was just a jumble of vegetables with some pasta. No flavor. It might be better with broth instead of water, and I would also go lighter on the parsley or replace it with basil. In other words, I would make something else!

I really liked this recipe - I did add a clove of garlic and topped it with parmesan, as I do most of my pasta dishes, and it was very good. I didn't find the sun-dried tomatoes to be overpowering at all, and the Kalamata olives add a lot more flavor than you would think.

I didn't try this recipe. I love all the ingredients, but it is a pasta dish with no olive oil or garlic. Therefore, I would have to agree with the reviewer above. It doesn't sound like it has much taste.

bland, smelled funny

The taste of the sun-dried tomatoes was simply overpowering (and I generally LOVE sun-dried tomatoes). I think that substituting chopped, fresh tomatoes for half the sun-dried would improve this dish, as well as freshly grated parmesan.
