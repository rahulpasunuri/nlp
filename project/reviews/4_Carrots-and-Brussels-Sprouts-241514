Delicious and very easy. I've made it a couple of different ways: used onions when I didn't have any shallots, and with balsamic instead of the cider vinegar. It's great every time.

Simple, easy, and tastes great. Would be wonderful with a thanksgiving turkey. The sprouts in our garden were a bit small this year, so I was able to make it without splitting them in half. Worked out just fine.

The recipe looks so simple, but the final product is amazingly tasty - I'm eating leftovers cold from out of the fridge, they're so good. I used a bag of 'mini' carrots straight out of the bag, and subbed balsamic for cider vinegar, but this is a winner. So simple, so easy, and so delicious!

I usually make the brussel sprouts and carmelized shallot recipe from this site, but decided to switch it up b/c I had some carrots to use up. It was DELICIOUS! Followed it to the letter. Easy as pie and indeed it only took 20 minutes! A Winner!

I prepared this for my husband and 14-year old son, who is incredibly picky about his vegetables. After both had second helpings, they told me to "SAVE this RECIPE, this is how brussel sprouts SHOULD be cooked!" Easy, and delicious!

Not Earth shattering but a decent alternative way to make brussels since we had plenty of carrots. Desperately in need of an herb, fresh thyme sounds good but only had a few sprigs of parsley. Used sauteeing olive oil to cook and EVOO to finish. Could use twice as much shallots in quarter rings rather than chopped and added some agave as the cider vinegar was a bit too sour. No issues with cooking time and small sprouts. Watch carefully, on medium high that liquid will evaporate in a jiffy, I had to add another 1/3 cup. Use homemade veggie broth for the first 1/3.

I love brussels sprouts and I always excited to try them in a new way. The carrots really made a great addition. I did sub balsamic for cider vinegar and used some olive oil in place of the butter.

Made as written but also added some sliced parsnips--turned out great. Washed and prepped veggies the night before and cooked it while the Xmas turkey was resting. Will definitely make it again!

This was stunningly good with our Thanksgiving dinner. I was afraid of the vinegar in the recipe but I needn't have worried. It was the exact right thing to brighten the vegetables. This will reappear during the year.

Delicious addition to the Thanksgiving table. However, in preparation, the Brussels sprouts and carrots took much longer than recommended (:45 total) because I was using a ceramic saute pan. Be sure you leave plenty of time to fully prepare this dish!

My husband loves brussels sprouts. They are is favorite vegetable. I love this recipe. 1. It's not fattening--you don't have to use all that butter, 2. It's so easy, and 3. The carrot really adds some sweetness and gorgeous color. I iused balsamic vinegar, which I think gave it a little nice "edege." I only made 1/2 the recipe, if that much, but needed to use the same amount of water and a slight less than the vinegar.

I served this for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas with rave reviews. Even those who typically do not like Brussels sprouts like them prepared this way. It did take longer to cook that the recipe states so allot 15-20 minutes for all cooking steps rather than the 8-12 minutes from the recipe.

I used balsamic as didn't have cider vinegar. It's good and easy once you get all the chopping and cleaning the sprouts done. Brussels sprouts aren't just for Christmas!

Even my husband who does not like brussel sprouts enjoyed this recipe. It looks beautiful, adding color to the plate, and is super easy to make. I wanted to do a little of the work in advance of the company, so I cooked the shallots, and browned the vegetables just before our company arrived. Later I heated it up again with the water and vinegar, and it was fine. The veggies did not lose any crispness.

3.5 forks. I'm watching calories these days so only used a little EVOO to sautee the shallots. I did use about 1 tsp. of butter at the end and a splash of aged balsamic vinegar (out of cider vinegar). Delicious and beautiful!

Excellent. Didn't change a thing, and we loved it. The Brussels sprouts I used were large, so I sliced them in 4ths, and used sliced baby carrots for this recipe. Really good. +

Used onions. They soaked up the cider vinegar. So good!

This was SOOOO good!!! I found that the cooking time was longer (maybe due to the fact I was using large brussel sprouts and carrots). I also had to add more cooking liquid - so I put in more water and some white cooking wine. Used red wine vinegar because that is all I had on hand. Next time I will try the cider vinegar because I have a feeling it makes a difference. I will be making this again for sure!!

My brussels sprouts cooked way faster than my carrots, even though I cut the carrots smaller than the recipe suggests. The flavor was quite nice, though. I added a few tablespoons of dry white wine.

Half our Thanksgiving diners don't like Brussels Sprouts, the other half don't like carrots. They all enjoyed this dish. I doubled the recipe, used lime juice instead of vinegar and sprinkled roasted pistachios over the finished dish.

Rating: 4
One of my favorite side dishes! I have made it so many times that I usually just wing the proportions. I find that the best versions are when I use 1.5 tablespoons olive oil + 1.5 tablespoons salted butter and a bit more shallot--if I don't have shallots on-hand, combining minced garlic and onions give a similar flavor. Same with the cider vinegar--a scant tablespoon of white wine, champagne or other vinegar variation substitutes just fine. I also let the carrots and Brussels sprouts brown a minute or two longer than the suggested 3-4 minutes.

I love it. I am not a big fan of brussels sprouts but want to cook it for my father in-law. Turned out really good. I use 1 tbs of margerine + 1tbs of olive oil to cook shallot and at the end I use red wine vinegar + 1/2 tbs of margerine. No salt added (there is some in margerine.) Instead of water, I use white wine.

Great dish! We used garlic instead of shallots, white wine instead of water for the steaming phase, and white balsamic vinegar. We used olive oil throughout but did add a tablespoon of butter at the end for the flavor. We served it with the Spicy Blackened Catfish recipe. My wife loved it! Definitely a combination for company. Ready for prime time.

Yum! I was looking for something quick and easy to do with brussels sprouts and this is it! I omitted the final tablespoon of butter and found this quite flavorful. in fact next time i will probably use only 1 tbsp of the butter or use olive oil instead. I served this over pasta and it was devoured!

After proudly never having eaten a brussels sprout in my 43-year-old life, I caved and made these for my brussels-loving husband. The dish was not only delicious, but also pretty and super simple to prepare! I will proudly make and eat this great side dish again!

I didn't really change that much to this recipe. I did not use butter, but instead a small amount (1 tbsp) of olive oil. I am not a member of the fat-policing committee, but I do think that many recipes contain too much butter or oil, which produce few incremental results. I am shocked how much I loved this dish. I do not like brussel sprouts, but my husband does, so I look out for recipes. This was delicious. I used broth instead of water and once I added vinegar to the dish, the sauce reduced to a beautiful consistency. It clung to the sprout leaves and coated the carrots. This was a great recipe that brought out the best of these humble vegetables.

So freaking good. Signed on as user just to review this. I've never made a good Brussels sprout, and this recipe makes me crazy - so so good.

Agree w/ many reviewers here - ok, but nothing special. I had hoped that the sauteeing step would bring out some of the sweetness of the sprouts, as roasting does, but overall the dish was just so-so. The good news was that the sprouts were well-cooked and it looked like nice. But nothing special in the taste - it needs something to kick it up a notch and I don't know what.

This is one of the best ways I've come across to cook sprouts. In the future I will first brown the carrots since they seemed to take a little longer and then the sprouts separately. I normally roast the carrots and the sprouts but preparing them this way really brought out their sweet and tender qualities. Even my kids ate it.

Loved this recipe. Great flavor and color. I did not get my brussels to the browned stage for fear of over cooking them. Even then, we loved this hearty side dish. The vinegar was a nice touch. We only steamed the vegetables for about 3 minutes, not 7 or 8 as the recipe reads.

Delicious vegetables! I think the cure for brussel sprouts is to make them as soft as possible, and the steaming/vinegar step in this recipe get the sprouts just tender enough! I did not have a shallot, so I diced red onion and a clove of garlic, and it came out so delicious. A really comforting winter side dish.

Believe it or not, I've never eaten brussels sprouts in my life but when I saw the recipe this month, I just had to make it. The shallots and cider vinegar added a nice flavour and before I knew it, I almost ate the entire dish. I made it with meatloaf and roasted rosemary potatoes for a nice winter comfort dinner. I will definately make again.
