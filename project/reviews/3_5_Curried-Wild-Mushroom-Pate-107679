Big hit, great for the vegetarians at the party. I'd dial down the curry next time or use a milder type. We're killing the scant leftovers while we clean up this morning.

I have had more repeat request for this than any other pate I have ever made. I doubled the garlic and upped the mixed herbs. I also used 75 percent shiitake and 25 percent chestnut mushrooms.

This was delicious, and got many compliments from my guests. It's true that the appearance leaves something to be desired, as do all pate's I've ever seen. The taste was fabulous, though. This recipe could easily be halved, it did make quite a lot.

If you love mushrooms, this is the party appetizer for you! I make this all the time and it is always a big hit with my guests-- the mushroom lovers in particular rave about it. Since it's not the most beautiful food in the world, I usually serve in a medium-sized ramekin and top with some fresh basil leaves. I have made it as written but I actually prefer it without the curry powder and cumin-- leaves more room for the savory, earthy mushroom flavor to shine through. My favorite herbs for this are basil and italian parsley. Other modifications I have made: 1/3 shiitakes and the rest brown button mushrooms (keeps the cost down somewhat), almonds instead of cashews, red onion for shallots (only when I ran out of shallots). Still delicious every time. I have cut down on the butter a couple of times but it's better full-fat.

Made with 12oz. pkg. of sliced crimini's from Trader Joes. Increase butter to 8T. for richness, 1T. of Madras curry, and 1t.cumin. Shallots, cashews, and EVOO remained the same. Italian parsley, and basil were my choice of herbs. The piece de resistance was to add 1T. of white truffle infused oil to really bring out the musk, and earthiness of the mushrooms. If using shiitakes, I would probably omit the truffle oil.

This was a hit at a recent dinner party. I used half curry powder and half garam massala since I had a better version of the latter. You must let this set for a day as it doesn't taste like much when first prepared. It makes a bunch and there was some left over. The leftovers would be great tossed with olive oil as a mushroom pesto over pasta or perhaps a layer in a veggie lasagna.

Excellent! Made it as the recipe states.

I didn't make this recipe (don't get mad!) but rather used it as a method for making a veggie pate with some wild mushrooms I had on hand (oyster and shitake) -- very good! I sauteed a shallot in 2 T butter till golden. Added about 3/4 of a lb of the mushrooms (equal amounts of each). Saute over low heat with generous amounts of white pepper, salt, fresh thyme and parsley, a bit of black pepper and a small minced garlic clove. I ground about 1/2 cup of sliced almonds in the food processor; removed and added the cooked mushrooms. Pulse till almost smooth, add almonds, correct seasoning (more thyme and white pepper, and a shot of sherry vinegar - lemon would be good too). The method (mushrooms, herbs and nuts) makes a delicious pate-like spread. Use whatever spices you like until you get the flavor you like! Yes, it looks like dog food - it's pate. The whole thing only took about 15 minutes (plus chilling time). As an aside, this recipe sounds good, and I will probably try it sometime when I'm feeling like curry and have cashews in the house.

Agree with earlier reviews that while this dish tasted good (after melding over 24 hours), it does make an enormous amount and is not very visually pleasing, as well being quite expensive to make. The only dish I had copiously left over at a recent cocktail party.

This pate was awesome. I love mushrooms and I love curry. Make sure you get Madras curry. The right amount of salt makes it perfect. It's even better after it sits for a while.

This was very good but perhaps a bit too much curry. I'm surprised at my comment because I almost always 'up' the spices. I did add one dash of cayenne but felt the curry was a bit too much. Perhaps it depends upon your curry; mine came from Penzey's - I used their Maharajah Curry Powder which is primo stuff. All of their spice are fresh and top quality. Anyway, the pate was really good and I will make it again. As much as I love chichen liver pates this is more heatlthy.

Yummy! I have made this recipe several times since it first came out. It is really much better when the mushrooms are in great shape and a little larger. I prefer to removed the stems to keep down the texture. This is really different and great served on water crackers of any kind!

hey - cook from jasper....this IS a pate. evidently you are not aware that pates can be crustless (if it had a crust it would be called pate en croute). it can, technically, also be referred to as a terrine. get out your copy of food lover's companion and look it up. and ease up on the attitude.

I love pate but don't eat liver or meat any more. This recipe was AMAZINGly good!Tasted and looked so much like pate. Delicious. NOTE: Trying to cut down on butter and oil I use a non stick pan and just 1 tbsp each of butter and of oil to sautee. Worked very well..and much less rich., I used crimini mushrooms and when done formed into a small loaf on a plate and then refrigerated. It was so easy to make, although it took about 25 minutes (not 12) for the liquid to evaporate from the mushroom mixture.

This is a terrine, a paté has a crust.

I did not personally like this pate, but all of my guests loved it. I'll make it again for them, but I thought it tasted earthy in a bad way.

As the cook in Tampa, I too loved this one. I also agree that it is a PATE, and if you don't know what a pate is or looks like don't make this. It is a wonderful receipe and I will be making it again.

OK, previous reviewers, this is pate. Most pate does not look appetizing. So, don't make this if you want a "pretty" appetizer. As for the taste, my husband, who dislikes mushrooms with a passion, enjoyed this as did the rest of our guests. It begins with a nice pate flavor and finishes with a gentle curry aftertaste. This is great with fresh vegetables such as celery, snow pea pods, carrots, cucumbers, bell peppers. To lighten the recipe for cholesterol riddled friends, replace the butter with half olive oil and half SmartChoice spread. Make sure you toast the cashews well.

This was disappointing. The flavor was lacking and it looked like dogfood (or worse). The recipe made a huge amount and should be halved. Better yet, skip this one. There are better uses for shiitaki mushrooms.

Blan and unattractive - needed much more curry and cumin. Wasn't a hit at all.

This recipe looked much more flavorful and interesting than it turned out. It is not visually attractive and it is relatively bland. A hard sell at my party.

Wonderful appetizer with champagne or a Spanish Cava. Like the idea it can be made 3 days ahead.

What a hit...I used fresh french bread toasted because my store was out of baguettes, and there was no leftovers. I'm not really a cook and it was so easy and delicious...it's a permanent request now!!
