I love these! They are very simple to make and go nicely with many dishes. I am trying to eat less bread and these fill the void well. The first time I made them, they were cooked perfectly but the second time they were not cooked long enough and were a little chewy - so just be sure to cook them until they are very crunchy.

I cook as a ministry for my pastor and wife. She is allergic to wheat! She was soooo happy when I made these grissini for her. Bread she could eat that wouldn't cause her pain that had flavor?!?! What an idea!

I probably undercooked these a bit since they weren't as crisp-crunchy as I was expecting. On the other hand, they were extremely easy; someone with a better knack for judging cooking times would probably have better luck.

The rye gives this a nice nutty flavor. I found them salty and I rolled my sticks in sesame seeds instead of the salt and pepper. Next time I make it I would only use 1/4 tsp of salt. Personal preference. Otherwise very easy to make and a nice change!
