Always great. Most Norwegians leave out the cinnamon, and haven't found kosher salt. Excellent with a snack or meal.

potet lefse Ok,the basic recipe works but is can be a sticky mess. I have been making lefse my whole life (a lot of years, I have probably made thousands in my lifetime) I always boil the potatoes in their skins to control moisture level and peel after they are cooked. Also, mash and then rice potatoes in this order. I use milk not cream. Also put mashed and riced potatoes in the bowl, let the butter melt on it top with the salt and flour and mix GENTLY with your hands. While it is still warm shape into a log GENTLY as overhandling makes lefse tough. There is no need to refridgerate the dough. It will remain fluffy if not overhandled. Then cut off a piece and roll on board with canvas over it that has flour rubbed into it. Then use a fabric covered rolling pin that has a similiar amount of flour on it. This way you get a minimal amount of sticking and not much flour will be added. I use 1/3 cup dough to make a 14-16 inch lefse but the author is right there is no reason they need to be this big.
