I don't know if the piloncillo cones differ but the color was so dark and the brown sugar flavor dominated the coconut almost completely. I wasn't too happy about that. I'll make with light brown sugar next time.

Review is for the ice cream portion only. I made the ice cream for a cookout, and it was a hit. I followed the recipe, using dark brown sugar instead of piloncillo cones as suggested, and substituting a tablespoon of vanilla extract (added with the rum) instead of simmering vanilla beans. The consistency and flavor of the ice cream was delicious. The brown sugar dominates, with almost a carmel type flavor, not a strong coconut flavor. The consistency is rich enough, but not like a dairy cream based ice cream, maybe more like gelato. We ate it with strawberries and sour/whipped cream dollops. Worth a try.
