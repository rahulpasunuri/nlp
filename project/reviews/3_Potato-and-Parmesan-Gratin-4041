Excellent and not oily. I used less cheese than called for and the flavor was great. Also, used 2% milk.

Overall a solid recipe. Complaints that dish is oily are not founded. I used both Romano and Parmesan and it was divine. You can speed up cook tiime by boiling potaties about 5-7 minutes then blanching them before slicing. You can also cut thicker slices this way. Also went on to take the recipe to another level with using zuccini once and adding rendered prosciuto in another. Perfect cool weather dish.

The first time I made this my extended family went wild, it was perfectly creamy and delicious. I made it just like the recipe said. I now get "assigned" to bring this to family dinners. Subsequent times I have not been able to duplicate the creaminess (sometimes more oily), but still a winner for taste and ease to fix.

I substituted grated romano and non-fat milk and it was still a little oily. The big problem though was it took far longer than an hour and 15 minutes to cook for no apparent reason (high alt...). I'm not adding this recipe to my recipe book.

Had no problem with oiliness as some people experienced. I used non-fat milk and bought grated Parmesan. The inner layers of cheese do separate a little, but the top is nice and crispy. Very easy to make.

Have to admit that my pecorino romano had been in the frig for awhile, so I think thats why it came out a bit oily. Next time I will shave the pecorino fresh or use another "very fresh" cheese. Otherwise, wonderful flavor.

I have made this dish on several occasions, and have always gotton rave reviews. It has never come out greasy as other reviewers noted. However, I have always used pecorino romano cheese instead of the parmesan.

Somewhat disappointed with this recipe. The Parmesan seemed to separate and get oily under the heat. I was hoping form something less greasy.

Easier than mashed potatoes for a crowd because once the potatoes are peeled, most of the work is done. The freshly grated parmesan is a treat. Came out a little greasy though tasty. I'd make it again, but not my favorite potato dish.

Delicious every time! Easy to make. I often make a smaller or larger amount & it still turns out good.
