I thought that the vinegar was a bit overpowering and I probably should have added an apple. I used the pre-peeled chestnuts in a jar (although they were extremely expensive). I think it turned out okay but my boyfriend insists that he "loved it"...

This recipe is good with potato pancakes. I added toasted caraway seeds to it, which I thought it needed. The chestnuts were fine in it - although next time I think I'd get them in a jar. I think it would also be good with an apple mixed in - would bring out the chestnut taste more.

The first time I tried the chestnuts and maybe I did something wrong, but we didn't like them. The cabbage, however, is a well balanced mild sweet and sour and is great with the carmelized apples from the roast goose recipe on this site.
