I seasoned the steaks beforehand with the same cumin, coriander, caraway mixture plus salt, which kicked up the flavor quite a bit...delicious.

What a great variation on a steak from the grill! The harissa sauce was de-lish. If you're looking for something a little different to do with a steak, this is it!

Whose idea was it to put SUGAR in this recipe? The sugar ruined the flavor and messed up two perfectly good steaks. I should have known better.

Yummy! I add a tablespoon of tomato concentrate to the mix to really bump up the flavour. It keeps beautifully too if you put in a jar and cover with olive oil.

I thought this sounded good when I read the recipe but it was simply scruptious! I couldn't be bothered to toast and grind spices on a weeknight so I used powdered coriander and cumin (and left out the carraway seeds).
