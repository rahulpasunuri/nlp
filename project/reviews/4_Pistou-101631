I'm just repeating what someone else said, but it can't be said enough! I have a lethal allergy to nuts and that includes pine nuts. This pistou is a perfect substitute and more! Thank you thank you.

Good lord this was good! My husband and I have been making pesto for years, until last year we encountered a case of 'pine mouth' after using some lower quality pine nuts (look it up, it's a thing). Regrettably, my husband has a severe nut allergy and just about any other type of nut as a substitution wouldn't work. I'm thrilled to have found this nut-free alternative to pesto. I don't miss the pine nuts *at all*.

I made the pistou with freshly grated Asiago instead of parmesan, then tossed it with sauteed kielbasa, zucchini, and mostacciolli. Even though I'm usually not big on pasta, I was quite impressed by the results! Very tasty! I can't wait to try this on some crusty bread.

Wonderful as a dip for bread like Todd said or a condiment on sandwiches/burgers, or on pasta with some fresh tomatoes. I leave out the salt as the brand of Parmesan I buy is a bit salty, but otherwise make exactly as written. I love this recipe!

The funny thing about Pistou when you tell people, is that they are quick to correct you as Pesto. This recipe is as old as the region which it is hailed from: Provence. It is simple, subtle and delicious as a dip and spread. It's a keeper alright!

A little bit of Pistou takes an ordinary soup into the memorable category. I cover it with saran right on the surface and then in an airtight container and it lasts several weeks, refrigerated.
