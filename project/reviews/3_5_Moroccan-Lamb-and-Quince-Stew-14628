I made this recipe for an "Iron Chef" house party (secret ingredient Cranberry). I won first place for the entre so I think this recipe should get top stars! Easy to make and made my house smell soooo yummy. Some modifications I made: I happened to have lamb leg so used that instead of shoulder and it was still nice and tender. Doubled the garlic. Doubled the cranberries since you can barely tell they are there otherwise. Used a beef demiglaze as my concience just can't handle veal tastey as it is. Used crispy pears rather than quinces as I couldnt find quinces. Served over the cous cous which was lovely, although the cous cous itself would have been terribly plain without the stew. I will definitely make this again as it was a tremendous success and pretty easy to make!

No! My family was really disappointed but not half as much as I was (having traveled far and wide for veal demi glace and juniper berries).

Delicious and quite easy to put together. I have made this with great success with venison as well as lamb.

Ca-ching! An expensive recipe for what it is. My "butcher" (meat handler) must have sold me leg of lamb rather than shoulder for when I followed the time instructions, the meat was dry and tough. I should have followed my instincts and only browned the meat (it was delicious at that time.) Even without that fiasco, look at the ingredients--expensive and not particularly easy to come by...veal demi-glace, 1/2 t saffron, quince, 3.5 lbs lamb, 3 C wine.....While the sauce is good, I don't think it's worth the money. Now I'm off to spend more $ on fresh lamb while I try to rescue a dinner party.

a wonderful stew. I agree, the demiglace is essential. I used cubed leg of lamb, which is leaner than shoulder, and reduced the cooking time considerably.

Although I rarely eat red meat I made this dish for a dinner party. I don't usually compliment my own cooking, but it was superb. The lamb was so tender, flavourful, and rich. I made it the night before the party to let the flavours meld, and I think it was worth it. The demi-glace added so much depth of flavour. I could not find fresh quince at this time of year so I substituted pears and let them cook for only 15 to 20 minutes. Also, I used quince jelly instead of red currant as the recipe suggests. The pistachio cous cous was the perfect accompaniment. I will make this wonderful recipe again for sure!

Fabulous and soothing. I served it on a cold night. My friends, to whom I served it, wanted to lick their plates. It wasn't all that difficult or time consuming. I did it with the pistacio couscous. It was perfect.

Unbelievable! Don't let the quince part scare you away. You can add apple or even just some root vegatables. But the sauce itself is to die for. Make sure you really use demiglace. Special order it if you have to. Here in the bay area Home Chef sells a fantastic demiglace.
