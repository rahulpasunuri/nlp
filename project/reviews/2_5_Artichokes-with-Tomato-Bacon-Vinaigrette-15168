Hated it as shown, over artichokes. i thought it tasted to oily, and overpowered the artichokes. Added some balsamic vinagar to cut the oiliness, and served over a mixed greens salad (with taosted pine nuts), and loved it ::shrug:: Go figure.

Extremely easy and great...very tasty. I don't like capers so I omit them and is still delicious.
