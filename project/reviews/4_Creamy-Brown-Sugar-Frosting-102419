So tasty. Especially when paired with the cranberry glaze the associated cake calls for. The frosting and glaze were given a two sticky thumbs up rating from the 4-year-old who quickly scraped them off with her fingers and licked them clean.

This is the most delicious and versatile frosting recipe I've ever made - look no further. I skip the OJ concentrate. Made with vanilla and almond extracts, it works beautifully on red velvet cake, or with a splash of rum and vanilla extract it's fabulous on carrot or spice cake. Haven't tried it with chocolate yet, but will go with double vanilla.

this is the best frosting recipe i've ever encountered. will never look for another. it was the perfect texture, the perfect weight. could not keep our fingers out of the bowl. used grand marnier instead of oj. tasted it before i added it in and it was good as it was but thought the GM added a lovely flavor.

Easy to make and delicious! I made devil's food cupcakes and frosted with this. Great combo!

Just made 1/2 a recipe for some banana bread and it's great. Nice and light and fluffy and the brown sugar gives it a nice flavor instead of using a vanilla or buttercream recipe.

Exceptionally easy, exceptionally delicious. I made a half-recipe and it was enough to ice two 9" cakes, even with me eating copious amounts.

I love this frosting! It is the perfect frosting for my banana rum cake and everyone wants me to make a double batch so they can lick the bowl of leftovers! (I do use rum or rum extract instead of vanilla, and often times I use coconut milk instead of the orange juice).

This is my new favorite cream cheese frosting. I had zero problems getting it to the proper consistency - I generally leave the cream cheese out overnight to ensure that it is soft enough. I did swap the OJ concentrate for Bailey's, equal amount, since I was making a cake with Bailey's, so it's possible the acid in the OJ makes the frosting a tad more loose. The brown sugar really complements the cream cheesiness and this makes plenty for a large cake.

Super rich and lovely. While it was very slightly on the loose side, I'm sure a few minutes in the fridge would have made things just dandy. I didn't add the orange juice.

good and even better with almond extract in addition to vanilla. used with choc cupcakes -nice combo. stick with regular cream cheese - low fat gives a wierd consistency

Really delicious and simple to make. Creamy texture. Should have chilled more than 30 minutes though.

The BEST frosting I have ever made - not too sweet and delightfully tangy! Very refreshing and compliments the Orange layer cake superbly! (hard to keep fingers out of the bowl!)

I had no problem bringing this together. The taste is incredible! THe butter and cream cheese must be soft and mixed well before the other ingrediants are added for it to blend nicely.

the 12 oz of cream cheese and 1 1/2 sticks of butter does not work with 2 1/4 cups of powdered sugar and the 3/4 cup brown sugar. Ref. for 4 hours did not bring it together to spreadable consistance !

3/4 cups of brown sugar according to the magazine. WONDERFUL RECIPE.
