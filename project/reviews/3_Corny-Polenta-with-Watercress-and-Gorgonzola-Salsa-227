Delicious! Good combo of ingredients, and could not be more simple to make. You might want to cut back on the raw onion if you find it somewhat unpleasant, like I do. Also, I suspect using fresh corn rather than frozen would enhance this dish.

I love all the ingredients, so had high hopes, but was quite disappointed. The polenta was like cement. There are much better, creamier polenta recipes on this sight.

This was pretty good. I halfed the recipe and had to add more water to cook the corn meal than the half recipe called for. I should have roasted the corn like a previous reviewer did. I used fresh corn off the cob and thought that polenta itself needed a little boost. The salsa was good with the watercress. A little peppercress might be good or some crushed red pepper for a little more pizazz. The presentation was very appealing. All in all, I would make again though modify it some. Oh, and one of my guests swore she didn't like polenta and cleaned her plate, so....

This is a wonderful, quick, healthy, low-cost meal. I substituted fresh basil leaves for watercress and added roasted red peppers. In the future I'd try adding chicken. With some extra veggies on the side this became a full meal for two.

This up there on my list of vegetarian entrees. I agree, everything comes together perfectly in this recipe. When we eat it we mix it all together on the plate!

Delicious! All the ingredients in this dish love each other. I roasted the corn and added it to the salsa rather than the polenta. A perfect vegetarian entree.
