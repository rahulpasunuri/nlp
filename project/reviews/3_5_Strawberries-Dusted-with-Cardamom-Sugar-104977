Delish! And so simple. As a casual alternative, I made 1/4 of the recipe and blended it with milk and ice cream, for the best strawberry shake EVER!

This is a fantastic, simple brunch item. Guests love this one when I serve it! Serve in a fun champagne or cocktail glass.

Very simple and easy. Modified- I had very large strawberries, cut in half. Mixed berries, Grand Marnier, sugar and cardamon mixture in bowl set sit for at least one hour. Served with fresh mint garnish. Next morning for brunch. Mixed left over berries with orange segments, sliced kiwi. A fresh and light treat.

So simple and so good. What could be easier than whole strawberries, mixed with ingredients that are always on hand? A keeper.

this is just fantastic and simple. i've done it many times. nice to use freshly ground cardamom. also, i just mix the grand marnier, sugar, and cardamom and toss the berries, rather than the more involved approach suggested

Very nice flavor combination. Don't be put off by the cardamom, which is a foreign flavor to most. It blends beautifully with the Grand Marnier and sugar for a subtle taste.

I combined the sugar, cardamom and Grand Marnier in a bowl, then macerated the strawberries, sliced, in it all day long. It was delicious, and very unusual--though I suppose that cardamom is just a logical progression from cinnamon and the other winter spices.

This unique and delicious little dish went perfectly with brunch. It should definitely be assembled at the last minute.

I had these ugly little organic strawberries from the Pacific Northwest that taste like heaven, and a slice of lemon, and some chocolate mint. This ended up being a gorgeous dessert plate, with the cardamom sugar and chocolate mint accentuating the little berries, and I added some dark chocolate squares for the more *serious* sweet tooth. So simple, elegant, and unique.

Easy! I made some changes which worked out well. I mixed fresh cardamom with LESS sugar 2 days in advance. After mixing the strawberries in the Grand Marnier, I LIGHTLY sprinkled them with the cardamom-sugar. Then, I made whipped cream with the remaining cardamom-sugar. A wonderful, subtle topping. ~Brison

I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and made these for dessert this evening. Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.
