I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe and found that it needed a little tweaking. The second time, I substituted blueberries for the cranberries and mixed in a little cornstarch with the pears before baking, I found that the sauce was just a little to runny the first time. Instead of rum the second time I used gran marnier - it turned out really well. For the custard sauce the second time, I added the addition of a vanilla bean. Will continue to make this with my changes over and over.

Delicious! We had this for dessert on Christmas. It was the perfect end to a wonderful meal. The biscuits are sweet and fluffy and the pears remain slightly crisp. Wonderful!
