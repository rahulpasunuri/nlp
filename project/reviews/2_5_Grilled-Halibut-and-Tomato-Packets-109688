This dish is good for a middle-of-the-week FAST barbecue dinner and I'll keep it on file for that, but I wouldn't serve it to company. I didn't notice an unpleasant odor.

This is yummy. I have substituted sea bass and mahi mahi with excellent results. I don't have a grill, so I place the foil packet in a baking dish and bake in my oven. I like serving it with orzo in a lemon vinaigrette or baby Yukon Gold potatoes roasted in olive oil, sea salt, and fresh rosemary.

Didn't have vermouth on hand so I substituted Chardonnay. Also, used Thai basil instead of tarragon which added a nice fragrance and flavor. Easy clean up!!

I liked this recipe a lot. Didn't use fennel (didn't have it), and used lime zest instead of lemon. The smell didn't bother me but I'm a huge olive fan. I don't have a grill so I made this in the oven. 15 minutes at 350 degrees didn't get the fish all the way done into the middle -- next time I'll cook it longer.

Ugh. This dish sounded so delicious, but was just plain awful. The odor (not aroma!) was so nasty it ruined my appetite. I think it was the olive spread that did it in. Regardless, this was a waste of great fish and beautiful tomatoes.
