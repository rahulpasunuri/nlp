My family LOVED this recipe. I didn't have any tarragon but I did add diced red pepper along with the onions and broccoli stems. I made a couple of other modifications, I turned the paste into a cheese sauce by adding some veggie broth and grated cheese before adding the cream. I cooked the florets along with the other veggies and blended all of it before I added the cheese sauce. Didn't bother broiling because I was short on time. My 6yr old actually asked for seconds and she never does! Definitely a keeper!

Definitely needs salt. Of course you should taste before it's finished - perhaps the recipe should state that, but any person who cooks knows to do this. I substituted a cup of stout with the chicken stock for a deeper quality and used the immersion blender for a smoother soup. Definitely a good recipe you could build off of.

Wonderful soup, made even better following other reviewers' suggestions. Used top blade on food processor to slice stems, onion and garlic. Sautéed in butter as directed and added stock. When tender, puréed using immersion blender. Added florets and one box of thawed spinach squeezed dry. Covered and let simmer until florets were tender. Added 2 cups half-and-half, puréed again, stirred in cheese, added salt and pepper to taste. Really tasty soup.

One more thing - never, ever put raw flour into food. It always ruins the taste. The roux needs to be fried.

A good soup but nothing to write home about. Didn't make any changes except for one - I blended the whole thing. Found the soup somewhat uninspiring, so I crisp-fried some pancetta and threw it in. Might make it again, but not for company.

Putting the cheese on top then melting it under the broiler until bubbly makes the soup. Very tasty and not too heavy, will def make it again!

I would have rated this 2.5 stars if I could. It was good, but not in an exceptional way. I followed the recipe pretty much as presented, but melted the cheese into the roux instead of using it as a topping. Also pulsed the final product a few times in the food processor to improve the consistency.

Rating: 4
I can't believe people would leave out the tarragon - it really makes the dish. I used a hand blender after simmering the stock for 15 minutes. It still had a lot of chunk from the added florets. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This is *that* classic soup you want on a cold winter day. I read so much debate over tarragon vs. rosemary in this, and I actually prefer the simple flavors of the broccoli and cheese, so I left any herbs out. This is a heavy soup, but I found a few simple modifications did not sacrifice the flavor at all. I didn't use all of the butter in the beginning to saute the broccoli stems and onions (maybe used 1 T). Also, I skipped the cream entirely since my blending method below made it velvety smooth. Once I had the soup base with the cheese added, I used my immersion blender to make it more bisque-like, then I added the broccoli florets and cooked a little longer. Kids wolfed it down ... as did Mom & Dad. Enjoy!

Very much liked this recipe... the soup was fantastic, and the tarragon added great flavour. We substituted condensed milk for the cream to reduce calories (laughing because there is so much cheese!).

Delicious prepared as per recipe. Did not find tarragon too heavy. I also tried roasting the broccoli, onion & garlic together in the oven @ 400 for 30 minutes instead of sauteeing, and that added a nice depth.

I don't know why I'm writing this review because I changed the recipe so much it's not really the same soup. But here goes. I wanted to produce an almost fat-free version so I began by using only a tablespoon of olive oil for sauteing the vegetables. I deleted the cream; instead, I added two cups of grated fat-free cheddar cheese (Lifeline brand) to the simmered vegetables and pureed the whole thing in a high-powered blender to make a creamy base. I skipped the flour/butter part and just added the broccoli florets, which I had microwaved until tender-crisp, to the soup base. It was great! Really rich tasting and just about no fat per serving.

I don`t like tarragon so added rosemary as suggested but either added too much or just didn`t like the flavor. This soup was ok but not a rave. I didn`t feel that it needed an entire cup of whipping cream.

Perfect soup for a chilly autumn night. Made this last night and it was so good. I also substituted the Tarragon for Rosemary as per the other reviews and it worked out great. Also added a little more garlic for kick as suggested. Love getting great tips from everybody's reviews! Did not bake the cheese on top as I gave it to my two year old son as well and he loved it! Definitely will make this again.

This is a great recipe. I've made this soup twice now, great hit with the entire family. Second time around I used cheddar and jack cheese instead of sharp cheddar and a lot less of dried tarragon. With recipe modifications soup came out a lot less bitter and "sharp". Tastes great when warmed up as leftovers.

My husband made this soup for dinner one night and it was amazing. He used rosemary instead of the tarragon and I think that really was the key flavor. Exceptional.

Good basic recipe. I blended 3/4 of stock before adding florets towards end. Also added 1 teaspoon of Tony Chachere's (cajun seasoning blend)and blended the cheese into the stock in the final minute of cooking. Would probaly spice it up next time with a little more garlic. Needs a little black pepper also.

Easy cook. Way too uptight about a soup recipe! I for one totally appreciate each and every cook's helpful hints and always read the reviews before I start. The art of cooking is exactly that; an art meant to be enjoyed, not something that throws you into a rage! Maybe you should look for a less stressful hobby. Just saying...

Nothing irritates me more on a resource website than reading reviews to get information about a posted recipe and finding the first page of "reviews" are people talking about changes they made to a recipe that change the entire flavor profile of the dish, and then saying they are in fact reviewing the recipe that is posted. NOT SO. if you put Rosemary in this soup you are changing the flavor entirely. Tarragon is an anise-like flavor, rosemary is in the pine family. Jack cheese tastes nothing like cheddar cheese. If you didn't even put milk in the recipe to substitute for cream, please shut up. The actual RECPIPE of this soup is delicious. Not that anyone would know from reading the reviews of people's creativity rather than how they like the real soup. The only change I have made is adding the cheddar cheese to the soup instead of broiling it on top, because it works better for multi-day eating and tastes good that way. It does not change the flavor profile of the soup. Make the recipe. If you are looking for something low in fat, this is not it, although I can see that using somewhat less butter would not affect the tastiness (there IS a ton). If you don't like tarragon, look elsewhere, because there is a reason they asked for tarragon. Have to say that the reviewer who thought this was bland and lacking in salt must need about a tablespoon of salt with every meal, or used unsalted broth. If you use packaged broth or a bouillion, you might want to salt at the end after you taste it. I find this soup plenty flavorful, and it is a regular winter recipe in my family.

Rating: 3
I think this is a tasty soup but have made some changes over time to reduce fat and prep time. I use 3-4 T butter, low fat milk and vegetable stock. Instead of making roux in a separate pan, I just add flour to sauteed vegetables until paste is formed, slowly add stock and stir while thickens, then follow remainder of recipe. Extra tarragon is good. I also add cheese directly to the soup (extra sharp cheddar) to make leftovers easier. This is a regular for my family.

This was yummy! I used rosemary, I didnt have tarragon, and added S & P and used about 2/3 the butter and whole milk instead. It is even better with toasted bread like croutons!

I made this soup without adding the cream or flour and it was thick and creamy. I used homemade stock and added two small carrots and one potato at the same time as the broccoli stems I used an immersion blender and stirred all of the cheese into the soup at the end. Definitely up the garlic and seasonings to taste. I will make this again it was a huge hit with my kids

the base of this soup is tasteless... needs perking up..... no SALT? Made this, melted the cheese into the soup and even that didn't help the flavor. Added salt and it improved a bit- overall tasteless recipe. I threw most of it out.

We really enjoy this soup! I follow the recipe except using a lighter cream instead of the whipping cream (saving some calories!). Also, we put in the cheese directly in the soup since we use these for our weekly lunches. Wonderful soup! Highly recommend it!

Very, very good. I substituted rosemary for the tarragon (which I didn't have around) with great success; I also omitted the cream since I had none. I pureed the soup before adding the roux, and since I have no bowls I can put under the broiler, I mixed the cheese into the soup at the end. With those changes, it was tremendous; it needs no cream since the roux and the blending thickened it considerably, and it was already very rich. Somehow it had a fresh, piquant taste -- maybe from the rosemary? -- that too often broccoli soups lack. A word of advice: Don't cook the soup any longer than five minutes or so after adding the florets, depending on their size! This soup's saving grace was the firmness of the florets. I think it might have been a little insipid had I cooked them longer.

I made a few changes of my own and soup was fabulous. First after adding the broth and letting the crowns and onion get tender I scooped that mixture out and blended it smooth then added back to broth. I dont care for tarragon so I used rosemary instead it was superb. I did not have whipping cream so I used mostly milk with just a little bit of buttermilk that worked very nicely. I would definately recommend putting cheese on and sticking under broiler adds a great flavor and chewiness to the soup. I have three boys in my house and they all loved it!

I wanted this to be good. I really did! I made it very close to how the recipe calls for, but I pureed the broccoli, onion, and broth mixture in the food processor BEFORE adding the cream and florets. I also added a generous amount of salt. I just felt it was not as flavorful as I would have liked, so let's hope that it really does improve after a few hours melding in the fridge!

Like Christie (NH foodie), I also omitted the cream, tripled the garlic, added 5 small potatoes, 1 cup whole milk, and pureed before cooking the florets for the last 5 minutes. I also added some smoked ham chunks and 12oz of canned green chilies. Yum.

I expected a rich, thick, and creamy soup and instead got something thin and unexciting. Maybe it was my roux...Anyway, I will say that this is one of those soups whose flavors develop with a few days--the flavor was amazing on day two and day three. If you can, make this ahead a few days!

Ok. I made a few modifications because I wanted it to be Atkins-diet friendly. I did everything except I used half as much broccoli and onion. Also I didn't use any thickening ingredients (flour and butter). And rather than melt the cheese on top in a broiler, I mixed the cheddar right in the soup until it melted. I also added some pepper jack.

This was kinda bland the first night and got better after a few days. By the third day, it was full of flavor. Even with the roux, this was not a thick soup, like I pictured. I would be interested in trying a stronger cheese for the topping, like gruyere.

Loved this soup! I did not use the cream because I didn't have it on hand -- I threw in some cheese rinds I'd been saving while the soup simmered and then added 1 c. 2% milk before adding the florets and flour-butter mixture. I considered pureeing it first and wish I had -- will definitely do so next time! Still, a really good recipe.

I modified the recipe: reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp, omitted the cream and flour but used a leftover baked potato (peeled & cubed) to thicken. I substituted 1 cup Black & Tan beer for the whipping cream. Pureed everything in the blender for a creamy soup. DO NOT omit the tarragon - as another cook noted, it makes the soup sing.

I followed the recipe w/modifications. Tripled the garlic; added 5 small yukon gold potatoes (diced) while it simmered for 15 minutes, then pureed whole thing to get creamy texture w/o the whipping cream. Then you don't need to use the remaining butter w/ flour either b/c it's already thick. I just added 1 cup 1% milk for thinning and then simmered all of it w/florets for the last 5 minutes. AWESOME! Lower fat too...only the 3T.butter this way. -Christie (NH foodie)

This is a great recipe. I added 3oz of cream cheese and substituted milk for butter to create the roux. I added only chicken base and milk instead of broth. It was well received in my restaurant and I found it to be very creamy.

Soup was good with modifications. Doubled the garlic; used low salt fat-free bouillon. I agree with using the half and half -and I used fat free. No problem with thickening. As for thcikening issue -I sauted the stems and onions for six minutes, then added flour (I use Wondra though). Once thickened *then* I added the bouillon and simmered for about 35-40 minutes instead of boiling the soup. I pureed the soup a bit (but not completely). I topped it with extra extra sharp white cheddar (no fat reduction here). lol I like terragon, but agree it needed some other herbs. The kids loved it and the husband and I didn't have a fat overload! ;-)

I think three Tbs of butter and half and half instead of cream is completely rich and flavorful enough. That's what I used. I also puree d the soup before adding the cream, flour or florets, because I like a cream-of soup smooth. After pureeing, I simmered it again to reduce liquid, and whisked flour with hot soup for thickener, and put in half & half. I made the florets very small and added them last, when they were cooked the soup was done. This soup has great flavor, I could even use a little more broccoli because I like brocc. flavor. Rich, tasty and great with cheddar cheese toasts. (I didn't broil the cheese on mine--too rich--and it was still great, husband did and also loved it.) Remember, soup is always even better then next day! This is a keeper and repeater.

I really liked this soup...the broth to cream ratio was just right although I did add some pepper and 2 strips of crumbled cooked bacon as it seemed to need some salt. I did not have oven proof bowls so I simply added the cheddar but plan to get some new soup bowls as it would probably be delicious.

Wow! This was FABULOUS!! I used accidentally thawed frozen broccoli and I blended the stems and stock before adding 1/2 & 1/2 (instead of cream and it was FINE). May skip adding the butter/flour step, it was a little too thick for me.

Rating: 3
I am looking forward to making this recipe tonight; but my sister(who hates soup) and my brother-in-law love this soup. I would say from reading the reviews, however, that the problem with the thickness probably stems from the fact that many people have taken it upon themselves to substitute the cream for a "lower fat" alternative. Anyone who knows anything about cooking knows that there is a certain chemistry in cooking and unless you are very knowledgeable on the subject substitution are a no-no. Cream actually acts as a thickener so if you don't use cream you will be missing part of the thickening process.

Using many of the suggestions listed in the reviews, I rate this an EXCELLENT recipe even the first time I made it. I do reccommend peeling the broccoli stems, and decrease the chicken stock to 2 cans. I added 5 well cooked crumbled strips of bacon to the soup and 3 carrots (which I cooked in the microwave about 1 1/2 minutes before adding to the stock. I am not a fond lover of tarragon, so alternatively used oregano and thyme, salt and peper, as someone had suggested. Also used half and half instead of whip cream. I used one package (8 oz.) of extra sharp and 1 package (8 oz.) of colby jack. The recipe did not need any use of a blender what so ever, however again I pretty much follow the recipe instructions carefully. Was extremely favorful. Bonnie

I was a student at Bloomsburg University in the late 1980's and this was a favorite restaurant of students and their families. Also popular there was the rapsberry cheescake- I would love to get my hands on that recipe now. This recipe came out very well- although I skipped the cream and added milk instead. My children love it and it brings back good memories. Thanks to Russell and Maria for the recipe and good memories.

This recipe needs so much help it might as well be ignored. I make soup several times a week and the ratio of stock to broccoli is way off (too much stock). There's not enough flavor and too many calories. Add the flour (1/4 cup) to the saute to prevent lumping later. Skip the butter and cream entirely substituting whole milk and olive oil. Only a fool from AL would use Velveeta -- use real cheese. The author seems to have forgotten about salt and pepper. Half a teaspoon of tarragon has little effect on this much soup. I wouldn't even consider not blending at least 1/2 of this soup (with an immersion bender). Also broccoli stems need to be peeled unless you like that woody texture that can't be cooked out. Just add the cheese and thicken with cornstach and water if necessary at the end. Adjust spices. My advice is to find a better recipe like the Stilton Cauliflower soup from this website which is excellent.

I've been looking for a good broccoli soup recipe, and this was it! I took a short cut also and just sprinkled on the grated cheese. The flavor was perfect, not too heavy of a cream soup. Also, I replaced the cream with a fat free condensed milk, with very favorable results. Bon Appetit!

I made this soup today and thought it was great because it wasn't heavy and thick like most cream-based soups. The ratio of stock to cream was perfect, and created a balanced, flavorful soup base. Because I had it on hand and because I wanted an intense broccoli color and flavor, I wound up using almost twice as much broccoli as the recipe called for. I also pureed about 2/3 of the soup as a final step, leaving enough floret pieces intact to give my guests one or two in each bite. The result was a bright green soup of perfect consistency and flavor, with a varied texture. Completely yummy.

My husband loves broccoli so I am always looking for a recipe that gets me away from "steamed broccoli" and this is a great soup recipe. We like to pair it with Monte Cristo sandwiches. I, too, blended this after adding the cream - I think it just depends on how chunky you like your soup. For me, blending it and then adding the florets gave a nice thick base with just the right amount of full florets. I also just sprinkled the cheese on top while the soup was still piping hot rather than putting it inthe oven, mainly just because we were starving and didn't want to wait any longer.

I hate all these "I didn't have this, so I used that" things, but I'm going to do it: Didn't have tarragon, so I used thyme. Put a cup of grated cheese into the whole thing. Didn't have heavy cream. Made a roux with an extra tbls. of flour and 1 cup of plain yogurt. Came out great!

I guess this shows difference in taste. Thought the soup was completely bland, even though I used good quality, sharp chedder.

This is a "to die for" recipe; kind of a cross between a good French onion and a broccoli soup. I had to substitute oregano for the tarragon as was mysteriously out and I just dumped in maybe half a cup of half'n'half to cut the fat. I also used vegetable stock rather than chicken. It was totally delicious. I also did as other's recommended and just added the cheddar to the soup.

I made this recipe tonight and really enjoyed it. However, I would use more tarragon (i.e. 1 t. of dried tarragon instead of a 1/2 t., if no fresh tarragon is available) and add the cheese into the soup after the broccoli florets are tender (I prefer a cheesy soup flavor over the stringy, melted cheese that is produced by melting the cheese on top of the soup).

This is one of my staples--I make it at least once a month, more when broccoli's on sale (I admit it!). The only thing I do differently is stir the last cheese in rather than use the broiler. And sometimes I add extra cheese, because it makes it even richer and creamier. YUM!

I'd have to say that this is a great base recipe. I read many of the reviews and modified it accordingly. I added the broccoli stems, shredded carrots, and red skin potatoes to the onions at the beginning. I was surprised that the butter flour mixture incorporated so well, but had to add more thickening agents to get it to my liking. I also added roasted garlic and dried thyme since I didn't find tarragon at my local grocery store, and didn't feel like looking elsewhere. Next time I will try harder to locate tarragon if only because I've never used it before and it seemed to get good reviews. I added all the cheese and some extra salt because it was very bland to me. The finished product was excellent with a chunk of french bread. I will add bacon next time, only because I just love bacon and won't need to add too much salt...if any. Sorry for such along review, but that's what I like when I'm looking for tips.

Tasted great. Peeled the stalks, used only 1/2 c. cream & about 40 oz chix broth, had to use my immersion blender because the flour/butter paste turned lumpy when whisked into the soup. Then added the florets so all was well. Added 1 c. grated cheese to soup, which helped thicken. Tasty.

OK, here's the low carb, lactose-free way to do this deliciously. Forgot the butter and heavy cream, added some mushroom stems, Lactaid "milk", and simmered until the stems were soft. Added the florets until they were soft, and processed all smooth. Simmered until reduced a little and grated "natural" cheddar (lactose-ok) over the serving bowls. Yum!!

I just don't know how you all say it comes out watery. I've made this many times my teenagers beg for it! It is absolutely incredible.

We really enjoy this soup. I use dried thyme instead of tarragon (hard to get tarragon here), add a chopped red pepper to the onion to saute, add some hot pepper flakes, and reduce the amount of broth ( I like thicker soups). I always substitute milk for the cream, and use a hand blender to puree half of it at the end. Delicious with crushed crackers and cheddar sprinkled on top! PS: Saute the onion in a bit of olive oil. All that butter isn't needed.

to fix the watery soup problem: saute the stems with half the onions, garlic, and thyme. add 1/2 cup of broth to steam stems if they are not cooked tender enough. puree with 4 cups of broth and a handful of raw florets (for color) in a blender. pour the contents back into pot, add cream, remaining half of onions (saute before), florets, and pepper. make a roux with butter and flour in another big pot and then whisk in the soup. similar results to Lynn from IN. wonderful thick soup that can be eaten immediately. enjoy.

I am not sure I liked the tarragon. My husband and I tasted the soup before the cheese and decided to add all of the cheese in the pot instead of using the broil method. I used Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Cheddar. I used the whole stick and ended up putting a second block in. It made it cheesey which is just the way we like it. No need for salt. The salt comes from the cheese. Do use low sodium broth.

I would actually rate this 2.5 forks. I had the same problems as some of the other reviewers -it was way too watery, and I used heavy cream and pureed the stems as suggested. The cheese also sank in the crocks. I wanted to make this for Thanksgiving, and I'm glad I tested it ahead of time. The flavor was good (the tarragon is a nice addition, but use fresh), but I will only use florets with no pureeing, decrease the amount of chicken broth and increase the simmer time to allow it to thicken better. 3-4 forks as is? I don't think so!

The soup was gray, lumpy and thin with hunks of cheese in it. I re-read the recipe to be sure I didn't omit anything or really mess up somewhere but that doesn't seem to be the situation. Strange.....I use many, many recipes from Bon Appetit and this one was a real disappoitment.

Excellent! I added a little grated cheddar to my soup. The one problem I had is that my cheddar topping largely sank!!! I am not sure what happened. I did puree my soup using my trusty immersion blender, but if anything that should have helped since my soup was thicker. Maybe the cheese floats on the broccoli florets?!? Any thoughts would be appreciated.

This recipe is one of our all time favorites. We love the gratin on top. We cut down on the flour/butter mixture and instead puree half of it to thicken. You can also add a bit of potato.

I put some grated parmigiano on top of the soup and it was fantastic with some crusty bread. I agree, don't even think of using Velveeta product.

I enjoyed this recipe very much, but I added some cheese to the soup rather than serving it broiled on top & it was delicious. I have also frozen the left-overs & they reheat well. It makes for a great premade, cold day, meal.

My family loved it. I pureed the stems also and the soup was nice and thick. I made a roux with the flour because I didn't want the taste of raw flour in my soup and it worked out perfectly (mix flour and butter in separate pan, saute for a minute and slowly add pureed mixture to it, then return to the pot.) The tarragon was wonderful. I used (real) half and half instead of whipping cream - I love my food and would never use something other than real ingredients and never something reduced fat...yuck! The trick is to enjoy and not overindulge! My four-year-old had a problem with the cheese and possibly choking on it, so we stirred it in for him and ended up doing the same for ourselves.

Haven't made this yet, and when I do it won't be this exact recipe since I need to adapt it for lower carbohydrates (no flour, for example, so I'll reduce the stock and puree). I'm just here to say I am no food snob, but please, people - Velveeta is not cheese. It is not even food. It is cheese colored plastic with too much added salt (Look at the label - it is called "cheese food" - not cheese. To bear this name it must be no more than 51% cheese - the rest is preservatives.) Please don't ruin perfectly good broccoli soup with Velveeta (shudder). I especially love (not) the idea of using reduced fat milk instead of cream to make this dish "healthier" and then adding Velveeta. Just as diet soda does not cancel out a cheeseburger's calories, this does not compute. That is all.

I have made this soup several times and always puree it. I took it to a pot-luck at work and it was a huge hit. I often substitute fat-free half and half for the cream.

Very good basic cream of broccoli soup, especially with the subtle tarragon flavor. Since others thought it was too thin, I pureed the stems/onions/stock and then proceeded with the recipe as printed. It was perfect consistency. Also, we thought it was just as good without the cheese topping.

this was the best soup i've ever made! i would make it again! just thinking about it makes me all hungry! i want to make it for the people in my dorm but i just don't have the time! i'm so sure they would love it! just like i do!

I followed the suggestion from some earlier reviewers to purée the soup "stock" (including the VERY important step of adding the "soft-butter-mixed-with-flour" to thicken!!) before adding the broccoli florets at the end, and then broiling it covered in lovely, sharp chedar cheese. I do not know what some people mean about it being lousy, because it's one of the best soups I've ever made (and at this time of year, I make 3 or 4 a week!)... my fella and I gobbled it all up! I wonder, if some people substituted milk for the whipping cream, well then I could see it being runny... or maybe if they washed the broccoli but didn't shake out all the water, then that might make it runny... hmmm... the only change I make is to always substitute vegetable stock in place of chicken stock because we're vegetarians, but that's about it for changes... anywho... we think it is YUMMMMMMY!!!

If you are expecting a rich, creamy, cheesy soup, you will be very disappointed! I make soup at least once a week and after reading the ingredients/method and all the reviews, I thought I could adapt this recipe so it would be more flavourful and cheesy - WRONG! I added 1/2 cup white wine to the veggie mix while sauteing, pureed the onion/stalk/broth mix so the soup would be thicker, then added 1 cup each of grated sharp cheddar and swiss cheeses along with the cream, before adding the broccoli florets. More grated cheeses atop each bowl, then under the broiler. Even with all of that, the soup was still thin and quite bland with little cheesy or broccoli flavour other than the florets. Perhaps the chicken broth could be reduced to 4 cups to make it thicker, or maybe a potato would help, but this recipe certainly needs a lot of doctoring up to produce a good soup. Don't think I will bother making this one again - too many calories for a very mediocre product!

This soup was OK but not as good as other Cream of Broccoli soups that I have tried. The soup itself was not too thick. It's flavor was OK but a little bland. More of a creamy broth with a lot of broccoli in it. The recipe also made far more servings than indicated(I would say 10-12 servings).

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I added some diced red pepper for a little color as well as some canned butter beans since I knew I wasn't going to refrigerate it to thicken and wanted it to have some substance. I didn't have the right bowls to heat up but grated some cheddar over it anyway. Also used low-fat milk and veg broth - I'm sure it's lovely with cream though!

Having never made broccoli cheese soup, I was anticipating the creamy cheesy soup that is served everywhere. This is not a typical broccoli cheese soup! It is actually a broccoli bisque with broiled cheddar on the top. It is very very good! I guess I didnt read the recipe closely enough.

This soup was fabulous! I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers, using 1% milk instead of cream or half and half, and adding with it 1/2 pound Velveeta. I don't have an oven, so I just sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of each serving. I made this soup during one of the hottest weeks we've had this year, and my husband swore it was too hot for soup, but once he smelled it, he ended up having two bowls, and taking the leftovers for lunch the next day! The best results I've ever had from an online recipe.

I am also a Bloomsburg grad and have regular cravings for Russells soup (and beer)! This recipe is good, but somehow I can't get it exactly like they do. Guess I'll just have to make the trip back to Bloom!

Like other cooks, I pureed the stems and some of the heads; added most of the cheese to the body of the soup. Used half and half instead of cream, then put the rermainder of the cheese on top of the soup. Some cooks did not have the right bowls to use under the broiler. Just use ramekins. I did have to thicken it twice because it was a little runny. good, tho'.I will make it again.

I LOVE THIS SOUP RECIPE! THE TARRAGON GIVES IT A UNIQUE FLAVOR. I USED HALF AND HALF. ONE TIME I MADE IT AND ADDED POTATOES AND CELERY. THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!

There are much better broccoli and cheese recipes. Way too watery and had a weird texture.

this soup was wonderful, i followed some advice off here to add the velveeta, plus i used only 4 cups of broth instead of the 6 &1/2 cups, plus i only used 1/2 large onion instead of the whole thing, due to my kids not carring for onion, still had a small onion taste, was perfect. a tip for anyone who says it's to watery, add more flour & butter paste, that's the clue to making gravy, etc thicker.

Add a cup of velveta cheese to it, its delicious!

This recipe sounds much better than it actually is. I didn't substitute any ingredients and thought it was a waste of money and time. The soup was very watery and bland. Glad my boyfriend wasn't over because this wouldn't have made a very good impression.

This was a good recipe. I think it needed a little more spice but other than that, tasty. I would probably cut the broccoli a little smaller next time too to make it easier to eat.

Loved this - it has replaced my traditional broc-cheese soup recipe. What I like is that it saves time, mess, and trouble - no pureeing necessary, but it still has a full-bodied flavor. And although I usually don't like tarragon, it works in this combination.

I think this was the 1st time I actually followed a recipe without making changes and it was wonderful. That was the 1st time. I have made it since both by broiling the cheese on top and by adding the cheese to the heart of the soup. Either way it was great, just a different presentation. The mistake I made was using 2% milk instead of cream to cut the calories. It was a mistake only because I left the burner too high and while doing other things the milk curdled. I have since learned that cream does not curdle even at a boil, but milk does. If using milk and combining the cheese in the soup, just be careful not to heat above a simmer.

This soup is outstanding! It's alsovery easy. I've experimented with milk rather than cream, the substitution is worthwhile! Less fat and a delicious soup. This is a keeper!

Had some doubts when making the recipe; found out I had no worries-the soup turned out great! Found that I didn't need to puree the soup, had good consistency as is. Ended up adding the cheese to the body of soup as I don't have oven proof bowls. When serving, I added a small amount of cheese with a small brocolli floret on top as garnish. Will serve again-and tastes even better on the next day.

Excellent! My husband loved it. I will make it again. I didn't have cream so I used regular 2% milk and it came delicious.

Excellent flavor. I pureed everything w/ a stick blender before adding the cream (which was bad, so I had to substitute sour cream). Finally, I added the cheddar to the body of the soup at the end, as my bowls weren't oven-proof. Great reviews from all.

probably would rate 2.5 forks if i could. i think it would have been better to blend 1/2 the soup like other reviewers suggested. I used whole milk instead of cream & did find it a bit watery. all in all, a good recipe.

Neither my boyfriend nor I cared for this recipe. Too rich for my taste, and the soup was watery, even after pureeing the stems and adding more flour/butter. Also, although I used only 1/4 the onion called for, the onion taste was overpowering (and I like onion!).

Yum! This soup was fantastic! This was the best broccoli soup I've ever made (or eaten for that matter). Most recipes I've have been much too watery, and at restaurants they are MUCH too thick and fatty. The texture was fabulous- creamy and thick- due to the broccoli and not the base. My whole family loved it!

This soup is fantastic, especially if you have high quality tarragon which I used for the first time. Now I just need to get some good soup bowls to go in the oven. (I couldn't really broil the cheese very effectively)

This recipe is wonderful! I changed a couple of things after reading the reviews. I put the soup through my blender before adding the broccoli florets, added cheese to the soup in the end (chunk of Velveta)and added 2 stalks of celery (diced) with the onion. Next time I will decrease the tarragon to 1/4 teasp (dry). Kids loved it!!

How did I love this soup? Well, hubby didn't get any, (cuz Grandpa and I gobbled it all up), so I am making it again tonight, AND, making enough for hubby to take to our restaurant, and enough to give my neighbor next door! * made changes. Don't all of us cooks do? Anyway, here they are: I did not use the broccoli stems (bought florets only) so I didn't need to. I did not use Cream, I used canned milk. I then added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and I used a hand held mixer to cream the soup. Last but not lease, I added of all things, Rice A Roni to the pot in the end, as I'd made some for dinner and had lots leftover and just threw it in. ABSOLUTE HEAVEN! I also did not bake with the cheddar, I just mixed in some cheese slices which melted nicely with the hot soup. I'm sure the original recipe is great, however, this ended up being, both easier, less dishes used, and absolutely a divine dish. PS: The next afternoon I added shredded chicken breast to the soup and micro-waved it. A full meal and still wonderful.

I took the suggestion of the first reviewer to puree the soup before adding the florets. I used 1% milk instead of cream and I used only half the recommended amount of butter. This produced a wonderful creamy consistency which I topped with extra sharp cheddar cheese. Excellent!

I have a really hard time making soups with just the right consistancy (eg. black bean & chorizo), and this one was no exception. It didn't seem to be rich or thick enough to support the cheese. My theory is that the soup should be pureed/processed after the stems have cooked and before cream or the florets go in. That may even negate the need for the flour/butter addition. Also, pay attention to how you cut the pieces as it is awkward to find pieces that are too large of too small. Finally, don't overcook or the florets will turn to mush.
