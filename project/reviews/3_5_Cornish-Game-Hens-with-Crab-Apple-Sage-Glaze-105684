I truly think this is a great recipe. I didn't have crab apple jelly. I can't believe they don't sell it anymore. I used just plaining apple jelly. It is really great. The best cornish hens I have tasted.

I tried 2 other cornish hen recipes as well and this one came in last. Just wasn't that special.

Both my husband and I thought these were the tastiest hens I have ever made. I didn't have the crab apple jelly so as suggested I used the jalapeno jelly. I also roasted the hens whole and stuffed them with chicken & apple sausages and apricot stuffing...yum. A definite keeper and will make next time I have a dinner party.

We used plum jam and it was awesome. Great Christmas Day dinner.

We created a complete dinner around an apple theme with these cornish hens as the main course. I couldn't find crab apple jelly, so just used apple jelly. The best cornish game hen recipe I've made and we all agreed it is a 4-forker!

Awesome, very easy and elegant. My Mom made is with crabapple jelly, I found that hard to find, so I used red pepper jelly. Great flavor and a super color for the holidays. I roasted whole hens, turning them halfway for browning, glazed the last 20 minutes or so, the red pepper/sage was a pretty red and green on the plates. You could thicken pan sauce with a little corstarch. (I prefer arrowroot... better shine)

When I was living in Boston, you could find crab apple jelly in just about any gourmet shop. Now in Albuquerque, folks just look at me strangely when I ask. Apple jelly works okay, just don't get the kind tinted green, or your birds will look very strange...jaundiced you might say. I've actually found that chile jelly works very well with the sage-- better in fact than crab apple.

I could not find crab apple jelly. Can anyone tell me where to look?
