I didn't have any ground cardimom, so I substituted ginger. It went well with the lemon mousse. I used silicon sheets (top and bottom) rather than parchment and had no trouble with the crisps sticking to the silicon. I also sprinkled some sugar on the top layer before baking. I have a convection oven and found that the 15 minutes recommended by the recipe was too long. I baked mine for about 13 minutes. This dessert was light and tasty, a great way to end a heavy meal. It was different and my guests seemed to enjoy it.

I made this dish a couple times a few years ago, and recently made it again at a dinner party. It has since been requested at 3 dinners in the last month! I've modified the pistachio crisps and make little pistachio cups in a cupcake pan, and then put dollops of mousse in the cups. The result is a very elegant presentation.

I made these after a heavy Christmas Day dinner. They were wonderful - rave reviews from all. Strangley, I had to cook the crisps for almost twice as long as the reciepe said and my oven was just checked for calibration. They were the perfect ending to a hearty meal - light, fresh and the crisps were very crispy even though I made them the day before.

I have made this recipe many times after a large lobster feast, my specialty. It is so light and refreshing after a seafood dinner. The combination of the smooth lemon and the crisp napoleon is delightful. My napoleons do rise more than the photo shown, even with weight on them. The cardamom is a great flavor. I've served it at dinner parties with guests numbering from 4 to 14 and it has always been a hit.

I found the crisps to be VERY difficult to make, and I really don't have problems working with phyllo. They did, however, taste fabulous. The lemon mousse was delicious also. The presentation was less than spectacular, but I will make them again because they're pretty tasty.

Wonderful! This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party, a nice light finish to the meal. As others have said; less time baking the phyllo crisps, and more time thickening the curd. I'll make this many more times!

Wowsa! Relatively easy to make and such a light and melt in your mouth dream.... Filo preparation was a bit clumsy (filo sheets separated once baked). I am Greek and consider myself a pro at handling filo. Next time I might try preparing filo triangles by using the "flag fold" method. Use one long strip, place nut filling near bottom of strip (spread evenly all the way to edges), fold bottom of strip upwards so as to cover nuts (this way nuts will stay put), and fold up like a flag (perhaps add some more nuts midway in folding process). I don't think this will change the integrity of the recipe, and it will make it much easier to assembe and bake. You can even freeze unbaked filo triangles and have available for surprise guests or last minute dessert (mousse was soooo easy to prepare). A sure keeper...

I use the phyllo crisps for lots of other desserts.I add one more sheet and make larger triangles. I bake the crisps 12 minutes covered and 3-4 minutes uncovered.

Everybody loved this!! Served it with Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. I sprinkled a few raspberries on the plates when serving and it made a beautiful presentation. Great light dessert after a heavy meal. My phyllo crisps were done in about 9 minutes.

Simple and delicious. Two ingredients for the mousse...WOW! It could not be any easier, but be careful not to prepare the mousse more than 4 hours ahead or it will take on a whole new taste(and not one that you want to serve). Also take note that the phyllo crisps cook very quickly(5 - 7 minutes).

these were very easy......& just delicious. All made ahead assembled just before serving.

filo took less time to cook and I used cooking spray instead of butter which worked just as well. I cheated with the lemon curd and bought some as I had run out of time - it was delicious and I would make it again.

I served this dessert for an Easter dinner party. It was fun and impressive. The lemon curd took alot longer than 10 minutes to thicken, but finally turned out yummy. The fillo crisps took alot less time to bake. I burned the first batch, so watch them carefully. Also, I made my second batch alittle bigger. Delicious combination of flavors!

Tart and yummy. I served it for Easter dessert - a perfect match with Canadian Icewine. I used more lemon zest than the curd recipe (more zing?). When I make it again, I will use the phyllo designed for savoury dishes as it is slightly thicker. The gossamer thin fresh pastry phyllo was too finicky to work without tearing. Also, the cooking time of 15-18 min was too much - it was about 10 min in my oven.

Nice and simple,but with an interesting contrast of flavours,I wasnt sure how the nut sugar and the lemon would go together but they compliment each other quite nicely,I also tried the mouse making it with egg whites and found that it wasnt as good because,you really need the densness of the whipped cream to accompany the lightness of the phyllo crisps
