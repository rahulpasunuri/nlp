Tasty! Takes some time to make though-took me 3 hours - but it was different and yummy! Changes:I added half as much mustard-don't like mustard-but I agree it gave a nice base flavor. Also added a bit of honey to the egg/mastard wash and added onion powder and garlic powder to my crumbs...I think without the additions it would have been lacking in taste, so I would suggest adding these as well if you like more flavor! I ONLY baked mine-no frying. Baked at the 350 degrees for 20 minutes - then ramped it up to 400 degrees for 10 more minutes-was moist and crunchy. Served it with a cheddar and gruyere mac and cheese, brown sugar sweet potato mash topped with marshmellows and a honey bbq sauce spiked with bourbon to dip the chicken in-delicious. Felt like I was eating at a southern restaurant. Would suggest making if you want to feel like you are having fried tenders without the oil!

An easy and really good quick dinner. I made it with one chicken breast jus cut back on the egg and bread crumb mixture. Will definately make it again.

Very easy, and fast too! I added some seasoning to the dry breading (onion powder, cumin) and also used only olive oil. Baked 5 mins. Crunchy, not hard; moist inside. Used slightly less mustard than recipe bec I was nervous that it would be overpowering; it was only a nice flavorful accent. Will make again.

Very quick, easy and delicious recipe for chicken breast. Would probably work well w/chick. thighs too. My husband really liked it and he is not a big chicken eater. The mustard really added nice flavor. I also added a little bit of honey to the egg and mustard, but it probably would have been just as delicious without it. Would definitely make it again!

I rarely give 4 forks but this recipe deserves it. I made the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing. The trick to the frying is to make sure the oil is hot enough when you put the breasts in for browning.

This recipe suits any palate. I added a bit of honey and lemon to the mustard/egg mixture. The chicken was very tender and moist. Skipped the butter (you really don't need it, just use extra olive oil) and took another reviewer's suggestion to serve with baked beans and a green salad. Nice weeknight meal.

This was only ok. Very similar to another recipe that i already make. Though I did have a problem with the coating slipping off when finished. Oh well.

My husband and his whole family adore this! My husband especially enjoys sandwiches made from the leftovers. The only drawback to this recipe is that it seems to dirty a lot of dishes. I put 3 to 4 cloves of fresh crushed or minced garlic into the mustard and egg mixture for added kick. I also substitute a few dashes of dried thyme for the fresh. Also, if you aren't careful or try to move the chicken in the frying pan before the crust has set, the breading tends to fall off.

This chicken was wonderful! I actually forgot to add the mustard but I didn't miss it. I used a mixture of 2/3 cornmeal to some purchased seasoned bread crumbs and added some extra thyme and sage. I served it with some mustard baked beans and a green salad. Very tasty.

I loved this recipe and so did everyone else. Try using a good Dijon mustard such as Maille for more zip.

I thought this was very tasty, especially the thyme added a nice flavor. My guests raved about it. It was very easy to prepare but did not look very pretty on the plate.

I agree with the reader from Chicago. The chicken came out rather dry. We may have baked it too long. Our guest suggested skipping the baking and just frying it longer. It seemed like it needed more zip. I did like the mustard....but maybe more herbs. Don't think I would make again.

I followed this recipe closely, but it tasted dry and bland. The cornmeal crust gave it a very odd texture. I will say, however, that my 3 children all ate it without complaint.

My husband loved this recipe, but I thought it could be better with a few small changes. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the breadcrumb mix which we both agreed was a good idea. Next time I think I would use honey mustard for a milder, sweeter, mustard taste (I thought the mustard was a little overwhelming) and try to serve it with some sort of sauce. I only fried it for 1.5 min per side on med heat (instead of 2 min on med-high) and the chicken came out wonderfully tender. Yum!

Good basic recipe. I didn't follow the details too closely, but the mustard / egg combination and the herbed breadcrumbs give a nice subtle flavor. The chicken game out very moist and tender. You can deglaze the skillet and make a variety of sauces to top the chicken to make a more elgant dish

Great recipe - Used chicken tenders and did not put in oven. Added additional seasonings such as garlic & pepper to both egg batter & flour.

Easy recipe. I do agree it does need a bit something to jazz it up. Adding garlic sounds good, or at least have a very flavorful side dish -- like a chickpea salad (chickpeas, sliced olives, red peppers in a balsamic vinagrette).

I thought this was missing something. It was easy to make and it was ok but I expected it to be a bit more tasty. I might make it again but add a bit more spice to the breadcrumbs.

It came out very crispy and tender I also added lemon zest to the bread crumb cornmeal mixture, but it still lacked something??!! My husband said it needed somekind of a sauce, I agree, next time I will make a lemon butter caper sauce.

Wondeful dish. I'm not a Dijon eater but it made this dish. I omitted the butter for frying because of diet & used egg subst. and it was still great. Can only guess how good it would be with butter for frying, ect.. Leftovers makes a great sandwich or just warmed up will do.

I've impressed more than one person with this recipe. Everyone seems to think it's this elaborate process to come out such a delicious dish. This is easy, the texture is complex, the mustard flavor is delicious, and the chicken always comes out juicy. I like to have it with salsa or a little lemon juice.

I made this recipe for company and they loved it. Didn't have Dijon mustard so used some champagne mustard I had. I served this with a Romesca Sauce and it was delicious. Would make this again!

This was a last-minute choice for me, so I did not have fresh herbs, just dried, and I had to use ordinary French's mustard instead of Dijon. Nonetheless, the dish still tasted wonderful. The cornmeal crust was crispy and flavourful, and it kept the chicken moist and delicious. I was worried about how mustardy the bonding dip was, as my husband is not keen on strong flavours, but cooking mellowed the flavour and he loved it. A keeper.

This chicken was fabulous, and I'm not a big chicken fan. My husband, a chef, thought it was great also. I used fresh herbs and fresh bread crumbs. I don't have a processor so the bread crumbs were VERY hard to do with a grater! LOL. I would definetely cook this again.

I made this dish without frying the chicken as recommended by some others and found it dry, dry, dry and very bland. On the other hand my husband enjoy it. Next time I WILL fry.

This is the one recipe everyone begs me to make at my home. My little sister tries to find out where chicken breasts are on sale just so she argue a need for making them. The combination of buttery, crispy cornmeal, and the dijon mustard is heaven.

This was a great recipe--the chicken flavor remained bright and the cornmeal crust added just the right bite. I've tried it twice and the second time used a spiced, honey dijon and liked it even more. And it pairs very well with roasted garlic mashed potatoes (also found @epicurious.com). Thanks.

This dish was great!!!!Delicious! I could not believe how tasty and moist it was when I took my first bite. Used storebought Italian breadcrumbs and did fry and then bake. Next time I will try just baking because its one less step. Highly recommend.

This dish is AMAZING ! I've made it three times now & my husband & I fight over the left-overs. Use fresh, not dried, herbs. Makes a huge difference. High quality cornmeal also improves this dish - the one made by Arrowhead Mills (available from most health food stores) is perfect. A crisp, green salad, crusty bread & a glass of good white wine makes this food for the Gods. Delish. And soooo easy !

I followed the review below this one and baked the chicken instead of doing the frying step and I agree, it was very good! I sliced the chicken and added some fresh mango to some homemade salsa, and served it on top. It looked pretty and mde it even better. I will definately serve this again.

Watching your fat intake? No need to fry the breasts in all that butter and oil. Do not pound breasts, keep them plump, and dip in mustard mixture and cornmeal/FRESH breadcrumb mixture. Place in greased baking dish and spray entire surface with your favorite oil spray. Bake @350 for aprox 45 min. Moist and delicious

This was great tasting and easy to make. I substituted Italian Bread Crumbs, instead of fresh, and used half djion and half honey mustard. The crust stuck a bit to the pan but not too much. My husband enjoyed it the first night and it reheated very well.

Very flavorful and moist. It was a big hit with my husband. I will definitely make it again. I did have a problem with the cornmeal crust detaching from the chicken in the oil. It may have been that the oil was not hot enough or I tried to turn it too soon.

EASY & Delicious!!! Will definitely make this again. One piece of advice for the cook in Vermont...make sure the oil is HOT before placing the chicken in it...otherwise the breading (whether it is cornmeal, breadcrumbs or crackermeal, will absorb oil).

Rating: 2
I agree with the reviewer from Vermont. My crust was soggy but I had prepared it about 2 hours ahead and then put in oven and thought that might have been the reason. I'll try it again because I really liked the taste but I thought I would process the cornmeal in the cuisinart for a bit first.

Although the chicken was juicy and tender, the cornmeal really soaked up all of the oil. I'll stick with breadcrumbs. I'm not doubting the recipe as it could have been the cook!
