Great dressing! I used small tomatoes which I found easier to get on a fork. I served this with an Avgolemono rice and lemon soup. It was a great meal!

seems obvious, right? but I didn't know about the garlic powder. delicious, kids ate it too - used kalamata pitted olives from local maker - all delicious, kids ate it too (1 and 4) - used only 1/4 of the dressing, it was plenty

It is probably good, but in Greece there is no such a thing as a GREEK salad with lettuce.

This is a delicous basic recipe. Sometimes I add capers when I make a greek salad. And, instead of drizzling lemon juice, tossing, and then adding vinaigrette...I just make a lemon juice vinaigrette. To turn this from a salad into a whole meal, I'll add falafel. But, instead of making falafel balls, sometimes I make a falafel crumble and sprinkle it right into a greek salad and serve with warm pita triangles and a dollop of hummus with a sprinkle of paprika on the plate. Sort of a falafel sandwich deconstructed into a salad.

Easy and yummy. We add artichoke hearts and chicken.

I really like this recipe. Flavorful and easy. I make this a lot.

Did any of you nay-sayers read the title of this recipe? It is a Family-Style Greek Salad. And the Greek family is from Pennsylvania. Enjoy it for what it is!

This honestly can't be labeled a "greek salad". Visit Greece and you'll notice that an authentic greek salad does not have lettuce in it. Nice try, but what you unfortunately have here is an American version of salad with feta and olives. Not even close.

AWESOME!! So easy. The flavors are wonderful, made one tiny change and added one packet of splenda to take the edge off the "tartness" Have made many times

I've made this twice--it's a great dish for a pot luck or picnic. I refuse to use iceberg lettuce, so I substituted with Romaine. I also seeded the tomatoes and cukes (too messy with them) and increased the olives to 1 cup (pitted kalamatas). The dressing is simple and delicious--but be careful not to douse the salad.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times, both for parties and picnics and it has been devoured every time. I have given it friends and they loved it too. Because it is not completely dependent on exact amounts, you can throw it together at the last minute at a picnic table and still have a great meal. I will make this over and over.

I've been to Greece and there's no lettuce in Greek salads; follow Helen's advice below. The dressing is a good start, but maybe add a bit more oregano and a little salt.

Delightful and easy to make. My changes -- I used 3 big heads of romaine lettuce (i had to feed 15 big eaters!); added some balsamic vinegar to the dressing; reduced the olive oil to same quantity of vinegar. I served this as a "small" part of a big meal (several salads, fried chicken, 3 desserts), and the Greek salad was the first to go!

This turned out great - I left the lettuce out and deseeded the cucumber and tomatoes - actually used a little more than recommended to make up for the lettuce.

Delicious and attractive presentation (sans lettuce). Was the perfect accompaniment to the Grilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb with Lemon, Herbs, and Garlic, another wonderful recipe on this site. Marinating the onion slices briefly in the lemon juice helps make digesting them a more pleasant experience.

Letter from Greece: You can add whatever your heart desires to a salad BUT: A "greek salad" or "xoriatiki" = peasant's salad consists of tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced pepper, oniions, olive oil, feta cheese and dried oregano. That's how it is served in most restaurants over here in Greece.

This is definitely a Greek salad! There are many variations to making this type of salad, and adding cooked prawns is one, but this is exactly the way my Greek husband taught me to make this salad when we were dating and it was good enough for me to want to keep him around!

Loved this salad. It was simple to put together and all the colors gave it such a nice presentation. I served it with the Greek-Style Penn with Fresh Tomatoes, Feta, and Dill and it was a perfect meal. The whole meal took about 30 minutes to prepare. Perfect for a mid-week quick meal.

To the cook from Dallas - I'm not sure what you ate at that restaurant but it certainly wasn't a Greek Salad. There are no shrimp, beets, anchovies, radishes or potato salad in a Greek Salad. There is also no lettuce in the classic salad as made in Greece, although you do find it that way in the States (and if you like it, why not add it). This recipe is basic and tasty.

A poor excuse for a Greek salad! Like what they serve at the Pappadeaux restaurant chain; an outrage! I know what a Greek salad is because I used to eat at the Pappas' restaurants in Tarpon Springs, FL! This one is just emptyp; it lacks a lot of the good stuff, like shrimp, beets, anchovies, radish, cucumber spears, and of course, the mound of potatoe salad buried underneath the lettuce, that makes it authentic.

I used this recipe for a lunchen that my friends had at college and everyone could not quit raving on how good the salad was. I can honestly say that this is one of the best salads I have ever tasted

I was asked to take a Greek salad to a pot-luck but i'm not a greek salad fan.This was really good and people who supposedly didn't like greek salad were all asking for the recipe.

I loved this salad, and have already made it twice. I used all Romaine, and used capers as I didn't have olives on hand. Cherry tomatoes are delicious here. This salad tastes just like the one in Jake's on Unionville Main Street (Ontario)!!
