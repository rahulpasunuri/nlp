This is excellent. I left out the mozzarella though. Still delicious and worth the effort.

So tasty! In reading other reviews, I tried to make this as simply as possible. I got cubed butternut squash from Trader Joe's, and cut it up a bit smaller - still easier than cutting up a whole squash. I also added ground turkey in one layer - I wanted some meat in it. I used cinnamon, cloves and garlic to season the meat, cooked it and put it in the first layer of the lasagna. I would definitely make this again. I think another way to make it easier would be to use chopped walnuts rather than hazelnuts which you have to shell/roast. Really excellent recipe!

This is my go-to recipe for an impressive dinner. So good, even meat and potatoes guys rave. After several experiments, I've returned to make the recipe exactly as written. Since it takes so long it's worth it to just double the recipe. Fresh mozzarella and a good Parm-Reg are key to success, and I find it's best with the hazelnuts rather than other nuts.

There is no drawback to this recipe. It's worth the time and effort involved. I only made a couple of changes, I used toasted pistachio's and I used extra garlic. I roasted the squash earlier in the day and prepped the noodles (I didn't use the no boil kind). This dish was eaten by my family every meal until it was gone, they loved it. So did I! Definitely made me lover Butternut squash even more!

I am not a "foodie", but took this to a "foodie" pot luck last night, and EVERYONE raved about it!! I substituted toasted almonds for the hazelnuts because that is what I had, used less cheese & butter, and otherwise stuck to the recipe. Delicious.

Just another note, reheat it with a healthy splash of milk. It makes it moist and amazing-- way better than the first eating this way!

It is really a shame that everyone feels the need to "bump up the flavor" with this. The beauty of this dish is the subtle flavors. The nutty sweetness that comes through is incredible and would be totally masked by doubling the garlic or the sage. I made this as written except that I used walnuts instead of hazelnuts (just to save money) and browned the butter (a way to make the flavor sing even more), and I added an extra onion and caramelized it fully (which is part of the recipe, I don't know why people say they added caramelized onions). Make this as is, be sure to salt properly, and you will be richly rewarded.

Wow! It was an excellent fall dish. I loved it. I have mixed feelings about readers providing suggestions on how to perfect dishes, but the readers advice on this recipe served it very, very well. Specifically: 1. Add more butternut squash and sage. Taste the filling before you assemble the lasagna and adjust accordingly. At the end of the day, more vegetables don't hurt anyone and adds more substance. 2. Add more cheese. I think that's good advice for any recipe. 3. More importantly, let the pan sit for at least 20 minutes after the baking is finished. What the dish looked like when it came out of the oven versus how easy it was to cut and serve was palpable. 4. Most importantly, enjoy! It was yummy!

Rating: 2
I was underwhelmed by this recipe. It literally took me 1 hour and 45 minutes to prepare prior to baking. I assembled the lasagna and then refrigerated it until baking. My husbands first comment was, The beans arent done. (In other words, he thought the hazelnuts were undercooked beans). I didnt think the hazelnuts added anything. The top of the lasagna was a stiff dry unappetizing fusion of the lasagna noodle and the cheese. Ill stick with my other tried-and-true butternut squash lasagna recipes from Martha Stewart.

Rating: 4
This is really delicious, and perfect for fall. I could even see making it on Thanksgiving as a turkey alternative. I only made some minor changes, mostly just increasing some amounts, as you always need more of everything when making lasagna. I got about a 5 lb squash, and used almost all of it. I cut the pieces much smaller than a 1/2 inch. It cooked faster and more even that way. I put in wayyyyy more sage, you almost can't put too much in when it's fresh. I skipped the parsley. Definitely try this recipe! It's lasagna but totally different than traditional lasagna. Mmmm :)

Rating: 3
first and foremost, this recipe is AMAZING! the only thing i might change next (and there will definitely be a next time!), i would maybe cut out a half tsp of salt somewhere and maybe use a 4 pound squash to make it a little "meatier." the sauce reminds of a pot pie type of sauce. pot pie lasagne, anyone???

So unique. Love the crunch of the hazelnuts. Time consuming but worth it. Simple ingredients and technique. Had a bit less sauce than expected, I probably cooked it for a bit too long. Will make again for sure.

Rating: 4
OMFG THIS WAS AMAZING!!! After reading so many good reviews, and then actually making the recipe - I firmly believe those who did not enjoy this recipe likely did something wrong. To make this recipe the ULTIMATE, do the following: - Gently sautee the chopped hazelnuts in butter. They become softer and soooo good. - Roast the squash, don't cut it up and fry it. That is WAY too much work. If you roast (350 degrees) and cool you can spoon the flesh out like butter. I then mix the onion/spice/hazelnuts into the sqash and mash together. - Use traditional noodles, I used traditional noodles and cooked them first - Double up on the spices - Add a touch more cheese, especially if entertaining - Add a touch of nutmeg to the bechamel. Yummy! **NOTE: This lasagna might be very goopy - if you are impatient you will have a globby, but delicious, mess. Do wait 15-20 minutes.**LASTLY: If you can, do things ahead of time. Roast the sqash a day before, etc.

I made this last night and it was a hit and a new favorite of mine and my husbands. It was fairly easy to prep, I used pregrated mozzarella and Parmesan. Next time I'll look for the precut butternut squash at the store, that was the hardest thing to prep and even that wasn't terribly hard. It took an hour and a half to prep and an hour to cook as the recipe stated. It was well worth the time investment, the flavors of the squash filling were delicious and I loved the sauce.

This recipe was a hit in my house, with a few minor substitutions: Pecans instead of hazelnuts and the addition of about 7 bacon strips crumbled and added to the squash filling before assembly of the lasagna.

I have made this twice now and will probably make it again for a holiday dinner. This is a spectacular dish, well worth the effort. Look for the squash already peeled and cubed in the market. Also the hazelnuts already chopped. Doubling the garlic helps. This makes at least 12 side dish servings. Works well for potlucks and can be slightly reheated.

I would give 3 1/2 forks if possible. I made this recipe with a few changes. I listened to other reviewers and doubled up on the spices. Double garlic and double sage. I also added some freshly grated nutmeg to the white sauce. It was a nice addition to the squash. The only thing I will change next time is the pasta. I used the no boil sheets and they are a little thin and don't provide as much texture as I would have liked. I think the pasta the you precook is thicker and would give more body. Since I am not a vegetarian, I also like the possible addition of chicken. I may try that as well. All around a delicious winter dish!

I made the recipe almost exactly as written. It took me nearly 4 hours to assemble - not including baking time. Total time nearly 5 hours. Results were fine, guests were pleased, but nothing spectacular. Verdict: nowhere near worth the effort involved.

this was _awesome_! yes, it's a bit of an epic undertaking, and no, this is surely not health food by any means, but for thanksgiving or some sort of crowdpleasing fall sort of thing, this is the true winner. i didn't find it bland but had taken other reviews' cue and added more garlic, probably about 2x, when garlic was specified. i also upped the sage hugely. since this was going to a big thanksgiving houseparty, i worked the presentation angle a bit by putting sage leaves in an angled pattern just below the last layer of cheese, which worked out very well.

This recipe is great! I always make this every year around Halloween and all of my friends love it. As a vegetarian, it's sometimes hard to make a dish that pleases everyone.

It takes a bit of time but is SO worth it.

I have made a variety of other pasta dishes mixing butternut squash and sage (such a classic pair) and this lasagna definitely was one of my favorites with this combination! Although it did take a little bit of prep-work, it is fairly easy to make. I do think that it makes well over 6 servings...possibly 8 but that's if you decide to eat a piece with other sides like pork/green beans which I did. It's best to make it for several people. I just made it for myself and I'm pretty sure I'm eating lasagna straight for a week. One small note: be careful when affixing the foil to the lasagna when you begin to bake it...don't let the foil touch the cheese because it will stick and come off with the foil! I thought the flavors were very sophisticated and definitely was a departure from the traditional marinara sauce lasagna...I would definitely make it again!

I don't like butternut squash (butternut squash soup = ick, butternut squash ravioli = boring). So when I went to a friend's house for dinner and she said she made this recipe for dinner, I thought, "oh geeze, I'll have a little piece to be polite.." it was so good, I had seconds, took home left overs and asked her for the recipe! The sauce delivers flavor and the squash & nuts give it a unique texture.

Although this recipe did not seem too inspiring to me, I decided to make it based on all the great reviews. Unfortunately, no one in my family really thought it was anything more than just edible. The flavors did not go well together at all. The sauce was great, but we all felt that the filling was lacking and bland... I will not be making this one again.

Served this at a dinner party last Friday and it was truly a big hit. I did substitute hazelnuts with walnuts and used acorn squash instead of butternut b/c the acorn around here was sweeter roasted. Oh yeah, I roasted the squash then heated it with the other ingredients. Easier for me. I also used 4 cups instead of 5 of 1% milk b/c I felt bad about the heaviness of the whole thing. I wound up not needing all of the sauce or the cheese. I was still very generous with the fat I think.

Rating: 4
Hazelnuts spell certain death for me, so I left them out. I also added Swiss chard to the squash mixture to make myself feel a bit less guilty about the bechamel sauce. Finally, I absolutely FORGOT to add any spices other than the bay leaf, and it still actually turned out great. You can see photos & read more details about my alterations here: http://bit.ly/aAp0DD

Excellent recipe...I made this dish for some friends and it was a hit! I loved the crunchiness of the nuts(although I substituted pecans) and added 1/2 c water to the butternut squash when cooking. I made it a day ahead and the flavors came together nicely. One suggestion though: I would roast the squash instead, just because it is so hard to peel and to cut raw.

Rating: 4
I've made this for a friend's wedding reception as well as for a lasagna dinner party, as a vegetarian alternative. Everyone raved about it, even the meat eaters. I suggest making it a day ahead and reheating it, if you have the time. The flavors meld beautifully and it cuts a little neater.

Yes, it's time-consuming, but well worth the effort, imo. I found the amount of sauce was just right for the no-boil lasagna. Subbed 5 oz crumbled goat cheese for the mozzarella; that gave a nice tang to the otherwise subtle flavors. Added pepper flakes too, as others suggested.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times now and most recently for the vegetarians at Thanksgiving and for a Christmas party. Both times it was definitely a hit. I found that roasting the squash cubes at 450F for 20-25 min. after tossing them in a tablespoon or so of olive oil is much simpler and really brings out the squash flavor. For the hazelnuts/filberts I just toss them with the skins after they have cooled a bit into the food processor to chop them to the desired consistency. Per earlier reviews I also used regular lasagne noodles. This has more steps than some recipes but wow is it worth it and since so many steps can be done ahead it works wonderfully for a party. I've had nothing but compliments on this recipe.

Amazing! I made this for a dinner party of 6 and everyone loved it! Great change from traditional lasagna, the hazelnuts make the dish.

This is a great vegetarian dish. I would recommend adding a bit more garlic to the sauce, maybe double the amount in the recipe. Although the squash and the hazelnut make for an interesting texture, it may lack just a bit in excitement. Sprinkle a little bit of nutmeg on top of the lasagne after it comes out of the oven. This gives it a very nice finish.

So I made this by just making the filling and stirring it together with some pasta and some mozarella and asiago cheeses in a casserole, drizzling maybe 1/2 cup of milk overtop (didn't make bechamel), and baking 30 minutes 350 degree oven uncovered. Turned out great and quite a bit simpling! I think the squash filling is the best part, I wouldn't change anything there.

Made this last night for group of friends. I sub'd in walnuts, and did not use as much cheese as others recommended. I will definitely make again, but I am going to use double the squash. Even though I bought a 4.25 lb squash, to compensate for the trimming and seeding, it was still not enough. I also roasted the squash before. I think it makes for a richer more caramel-y taste. I am going to also try just not using noodles, I think it would taste just as good, and not as heavy; more like a side.

I made this for a fall dinner party and my guests were incredibly impressed. I used more cheese than the recipe called for and think it was a wise choice. The cheese really balances everything nicely. I love the combination of the flavors. Someone who reviewed this said you can do without the hazelnuts, that is probably right but I think that would take this down to 3 forks instead of 4. The hazelnuts really add texture and dimension. I will certainly make this again and love the idea of making it as a vegetarian option for Thanksgiving. I served this with a very simple ceasar salad, which worked great.

Rating: 4
Delicious - I make this time and time again. I reduce the bechamel sauce and/or cheese though to make this dish a little lighter - most of the time I cut out the mozzarella, the dish can live without it as the parmesan has a lot of flavour. The flavours are really great together, and the nuts add some delicious crunch.

Rating: 1
I was really disappointed. Squash and hazelnuts are a great combination, but the dish had too much bechamel to be able to taste it. Now the lasagna was definitely edible just very bland. I have a recipe for a butternut squash lasnagna with a basil bechamel that I made every Thanksgiving and everyone loves it. I think I will just add hazelnuts to that recipe. Also I think this lasagna would benefit from some smokey mozzarella. You see a lot of squash, hazelnut and smokey mozz. recipes out their and it is a perfect trio.

When using no-boil lasagna,I soak the noodles in boiling water while preparing the sauce. Fill a 9x13 pan with boiling water and soak the noodles until they are pliable; dry them on a kitchen towel and proceed with recipe. This will ensure the noodles bake evenly.

This recipe is stellar, it wowed my dinner guests; both vegetarians and meat eaters. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and the only thing I would change would be to increase the cooking time slightly. I noticed some pieces of squash that were not fully cooked as well as a few bites of lasagna noodles that could have used a few more minutes. Next time I'll increase the covered baking time to 45 minutes. I served it as a main course with a French onion soup and the Spicy Green Salad with Manchego and Pears (both from epicurious.com) I've never had a meal that pleased so many people, from my picky three year old to my 88 year old grandmother. Almost heaven!

So yummy! I agree with a number of the other reviewers...use regular noodles (not no-boil) and add extra cheese/garlic/onion. Next time I'll bake and mash the squash and add spinach. The hazelnuts add a meaty texture that others liked but I could do without. I'd say it serves 8.

We and our guests loved this. Very warm and autumnal. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 glass dish. Came out perfect and fed four hearty portions.

Very nice vegetarian main course or side dish with meat. We did 4 pounds squash before it was peeled, etc. And used 8 oz of fresh mozzarella. I was surprised that it wasn't that hard to peel the hazelnuts, and I bet it would have been OK if you didn't peel them. We ended up with 1 less layer, I think, but that was fine. It was very nice looking as well.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I must say, was not totally blown away by it.

I made this exactly as written and I found the filling and sauce to be divine, but the noncook noodles were the weakest link.

This knocked it out of the park and my guests were blown away. Trust me on this--it is a five fork no-brainer. xoxo

OH! This is to die for! I made this for my dinner party tonight and it was SO incredible!!! I doubled the garlic in the sauce, used asiago cheese instead of parmigiano-Reggiano, and sprinkled 3/4 cup parmesan romano cheese in the middle layer. I made the filling and sauce a day ahead which made prep SO simple tonight. ALSO.. the hazelnuts are what I was looking forward to the most, and I almost died when I was about to take a bite and realized I had FORGOTTEN to add them in. :( I sprinkled them on top of my plate, but after trying a bite with and without, I liked it way better without. This recipe will be made OFTEN! Definitely Try it!

This was an amazing recipe and had rave reviews with guests. It does take some time and effort to prep, but the fact you can do most of it ahead of time is a bonus. Here are a few things I modified based on other reviews: I bought pre-cubed butternut squash - both costco and trader joe's has it. I doubled the garlic and the sage in the filling. I used whole milk and doubled the garlic in the sauce. When I first took it out of the oven it appeared quite runny, but quickly thickened. Delicious!

I chopped up a huge batch of butternut squash and found this recipe in my efforts to use it up. So not having to chop the squash was a huge time saver. I sauteed my veggies before I went to work, and made the sauce/assembled it when I got home. With the recipe broken up like that, I didn't find making it the hassle that I'm sure it was to those attempting it all at one go. Everyone at dinner loved it and went back for seconds, even my husband who was ostensibly already burned out on winter squash this season.

Rating: 4
After reading the other reviews, here are the changes I made: -used regular noodles, only cooking them for 1/2 the recommended time; -added a good pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce; -added nutmeg to the squash; -as suggested i doubled the garlic and rosemary, which came out swell; -since I was using frozen squash, I didn't add it to the milk mixture, instead I kept the sauce and squash as two separate layers; -i didn't do the whipped cream topping either, i just used the last of the sauce (which i wished i had more of coincidentally); It came out pretty good, but i think next time i would do less layers so that i could be more generous with the amount of sauce and squash for each layer. -Pinot grigio went well, as well as a light salad and garlic bread Yummy recipe and a good way to use up frozen squash from last years garden-- will make again!

This would be 4 forks for taste alone, but it was so incredibly time consuming I had to go down one, and I'm not someone who minds spending time in the kitchen. If you can get the precut squash, and then give it a rough chop, that seems the way to go. The filling also needed more seasoning, so I salted to taste. I made the sauce with 2% milk, which perhaps caused it to take longer to thicken, but the taste was still ideal. One other note - 1 cup grated Parmegiano Reggiano is NOT 3 oz. It's closer to 6.

This lasagne is not only unique, but it's incredibly delicious! Yeah, it's a bit tedious, but nothing worth doing was ever easy. To anyone who's ever dissected a butternut squash, you know it's difficult. Leave plenty of time for this task. Though, I would never dream of using canned pumpkin/squash/whate ver as a substitute or even mashing it! Also allow time to remove the skins from the hazelnuts. I poured boiling water over them and rubbed as much skin off as I could before putting them in the oven. I used slightly less than the 1 cup nuts stated and still found it to be a bit too nutty. When making the sauce, I added a pinch of freshly ground nutmeg, about a 1/2 tsp of paprika, and a sprinkle of dried chili flakes for a kick. I also added some spinach (about 250g) to my fillings - boiled, drained, and pressed to avoid making the dish too watery. Some previous reviews stated that it was not salted enough, so I just salted to taste instead of using measurements. Also, instead of using pre-shredded mozzarella, I used torn pieces of a fresh ball of mozzarella. I think that separated the flavours out a little instead of having everything melt together. Next time I might try goats cheese as suggested by another reviewer. I will definitely make it again - a great recipe for dinner parties!

This was fantastic. I made the filling and sauce the day before, although I added the nuts right before baking so they wouldn't get soggy. I used pre-cubed squash from Trader Joe's and then cut it down to about 1/4 inch cubes. That way it easily got tender in the 15 minutes of sautéing (but kept some texture  I would NOT advocate mashing it, as the lasagna would be too smoothly uniform), although I did pop a lid over the skillet for a few minutes to help that along. I also added a pinch of nutmeg to the béchamel. In the future, the only change Id make would be to leave off the very top pasta layer  it really just doesnt soften up enough, as the sauce runs down into the nooks in the pan, and I had to take it off before serving. I made a half recipe in an 8x8 and it was plenty for 4 people with one serving left over.

We approached with trepidation. Would it be too rich? Too sweet? Nope -- it's PERFECT! I needed a second pair of hands making the roux, and it took me longer than 90 minutes to assemble, but I never felt in over my head. Fun to make, awesome to eat.

Fantastic! I also roasted the squash and a couple of large cloves of garlic, then mashed them in with the (pre-carmelized) onions. Made the bechamel with 1% milk, added nutmeg to it. This is delicious, with a wonderful texture and very subtle, more-ish taste; however the recipe makes enough for 12 people easily. We were 5 total, and ate about 1/3 of the total lasagne. I do think this is a recipe that would adapt well to any changes, and will definitely make it again. Would probably use pine nuts in the future, as chopping the hazlenuts was a drag. Thanks to all the other reviewers who gave advice on doubling the sage, garlic, etc. Worked wonderfully well!

This was fabulous!!! Very rich with flavor. I used goat cheese instead of Parmigiano-Reggiano and it was great! It does take a lot of time so I just made everything in stages and it was fine. Everyone loved it and will make it again. I might try using leeks with it next time (taken from the butternut/hazelnut casarole).

I had this at a friend's dinner party last night and it was fabulous -- everyone raved. It was a great combination of textures and flavors. I was thrilled to find the recipe here on epicurious.com. (and would probably add a little smoked salt as one cook suggested). This recipe is going on our upcoming ski trip -- it's great comfort food on a cold winter night!

Rating: 3
I tried this last night and thought it was pretty good, though not as spectacular as I had hoped. One addition that adds some interest is replacing smoked salt for regular salt, and adding about a 1/2 teaspoon of dried corriander and also sage. The great thing about this dish is that it's massive, so if you have a lot of vegetarians over for dinner, this will feed them all!

This was great! Made it exactly as directed except for adding a little blue cheese along with the mozzarella and parmesan. I used nonfat milk in the sauce and had trouble getting it to thicken, but as it all got baked together, it turned out fine. Served along with a meat lasagne to meat-eating and veggie friends and this one disappeared first!

I made this 3 days ahead and froze it unbaked. Took it to our big family Christmas 8 hours away and just thawed and followed the baking instructions. Turned out great, everyone raved (and the vegetarians ate it for 2 meals). I would add a little more cheese next time, I didn't have enough to cover the top. Would definitely make again.

Although somewhat time consuming, this recipe was wonderful. It was a big hit with all 10 guests at my dinner party, even the avowed meat-eaters, skeptics and vegetable haters. I used fresh pasta from a local store and baked the squash and scooped it out and combined it with the other ingredients rather than trying to peel and cube it. I loved it so much that we're making it again for Christmas dinner. Even though it is time consuming, the fact that you can make the component parts in advance makes it easy to make for a party. This one will be a special occasion staple at my house!

Excellent recipe. This isn't as heavy as some lasagnes. In smaller servings, it would work well as part of a larger menu. I,too, found a link to this recipe on Yahoo, where it was billed as a quick, easy-to-fix dinner. It is anything but that. Even using the peeled squash in chunks now available in markets, the preparation took a solid hour. But this is worth the effort. The nuts add an interesting dimension to the taste and more texture. I wondered if grinding them up before adding them to the squash might enhance the flavor of the dish (of course, one would lose the texture element that way). Toasted almonds would also be a possibility here, I think, since hazelnuts can be difficult to find. I get headaches from bay leaves and subsituted nutmeg in the white sauce--that worked.

This dish is outstanding. Time consuming but well worth it. It also freezes well after baking!

MY family ranted and raved over this dish. This didn't take as long as I thought it would. I baked the squash for a bit to make it easier to peel, added a bit more salt, garlic, and some thyme because the reviewers said it didn't have enough flavor. I also made 1 and 1/2 times the sauce, which was more than enough, and finely chopped the hazlenuts.

A wonderful dish for a dinner party. One way to save work is to use one-two cans of pumpkin puree instead of the butternut sqush - gives same flavor profile but a different, smoother texture. Another way is to rub off some but not all the paper skin on the roasted hazelnuts.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always fabulous. I now use pre-grated italian blend cheese - okay, not very gourmet I admit; but it works well and cuts down on the expense and time needed for preparation - and I also mince the hazelnuts very finely in my food processor rather than chopping them coarsely as the recipe states. I serve it with a nice salad, and at one time I threw in some pork souvlaki as a side dish for the meat eaters in the crowd. This is a very big hit with my dinner guests.

I have made this dish many times, since it first appeared in the magazine, and it has always been a huge hit. It is a wonderful vegetarian main course, and is even better made with homemade sheets of pasta. I can't imagine why the one reviewer would suggest boiling the "no boil" pasta first. It is perfectly fine, as long as you make sure all of it is covered with sauce thoroughly before baking.

I thought this was good because it is unusual but not good enough to go to all the effort again. VERY labor intensive. Served it at a party and most comments were that it was "very good... and interesting." I would suggest adding a half a cup of water or so to the cooking squash, cover, and steam for a few minutes until tender. After 25 minutes of cooking the squash as directed it hadn't even started to soften. I agree with others that it is a bit sweet and next time would add some spice and more garlic. The sage is a must. I would even add extra. The hazelnuts added a nice crunch but not much in the way of flavor. I would go with shelled nuts to save some time.

Rating: 4
This was really delicious. I made it exactly according to the recipe except that I didn't use hazelnuts--a big change, I know, but read on. I had a bottle of hazelnut oil that I'd bought for another recipe and wanted to use some of that instead of spending more money. So I subbed 1 Tb of hazelnut oil for 1 Tb of butter when sauteeing the squash and also when making the roux. I also added about 1 cup of browned ground turkey (drizzled a bit of hazelnut oil on that too) to replace the 1 cup of nuts. Anyway it was fantastic, very autumny, not too sweet (I added a bit more salt and pepper than the recipe called for to combat any sweetness), and not actually too rich--there's a lot less cheese than in many lasagna recipes. It reheats very well. It would make a really good special-occasion main dish for vegetarians, and I'll definitely make it again for a weekend supper for just us.

This is incredibly delicious. I made it as the main dish for a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner last year and people could not get enough of it. As others recommended, I doubled the garlic and herbs. I also used fresh pasta -- rinsed it off but didn't cook it -- which really made a difference. The end result had great flavor and was rich without being heavy.

Didn't realize that the sauce and the hazelnut toasting would take up the most time. Good thing I used pumpkin puree (2 - 15 oz)in replacement of the butternut squash (used about 1 1/2Tbsp sugar to make up the sweetness that's in butternut). To add more protein & umph, I mixed in fresh ricotta cheese (15 oz)with the mozzarella & parmesan (1/2 tsp salt and sprinkling of the white pepper too). Dinner guests at holiday potluck went crazy. Next time will try a little nutmeg.

I have made this a few times now. And I must say it always gets raves. I make 1½ times the sauces and cheese mixture. It makes for a full pan of lasagne, but all you need is a salad, good bread & your fav white wine. I also roasted my squash and scooped out the cooked flesh into the sautéed onions, made it an even easier dish.

Rating: 3
The only reason I don't give this 4 forks is that when I make it again, I will carmelize the onions, before combining them w/the rest of the veggies. BUT, this is a delicious recipe! I followed it pretty much as directed. EXCEPT I bought the precut butternut squash, (as did other reviewers), and roasted it along w/the onions, garlic and olive oil, for about 45 min. Then, using a potato masher, mashed the roasted combo before continuing as per the written recipe. It turned out SCRUMPTIOUS to rave reviews!!! A perfect fall/Thanksgiving dish. LOVE it!!! Do try it.

Rating: 3
I would definitely make this dish again for a special occasion. No joke about it being labor intensive! I saved some time by using fresh butternut squash that had already been cut up.... I wish that I had found hazelnuts that had already been shelled! Give yourself plenty of time to deal with the hazelnuts. I followed the suggestions of others and doubled up the onion, garlic, sage, and parsley with good results. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the sauce, but could probably have added more. Good suggestions by others to grind the nuts for better incorporation and to puree the filling mixture. I think that it made for a nicer presentation.

Rating: 3
I can cut down the squash cooking time by pre-microwaving the squash cleaned and in whole pieces for about 5 mins. It also helps with cutting it into cubes, which tends to be a lot of work with uncooked squash. This is a great dish for a buffet crowd and for the vegetarian guests.

Delicious! This went over very well at a dinner party I threw for a group of vegetarian friends, and this omnivorous cook loved it too. It's fairly time intensive, but well worth it. I agree with other reviewers who have mentioned that hazelnuts are essential to the taste and texture of the lasagne; I would not omit or substitute them if at all possible.

So yummy! Worth the effort. The blend of flavors was very unique- it made for a nice departure from the standard meat-and-marinara lasagna.

This lasagna was well worth the effort! I followed many of the suggestions from other reviewers and increased the sage, parsley, salt and garlic.

This is wonderful. I am so glad to find something nice and different from the usual tomato sauce lasagne. Made this on a Thursday night, but baked it Friday afternoon for Friday night dinner. Worried that the no-boil noodles would dissolve overnight, but they were fine. The one drawback to not baking it immediately was that the nuts got soft, no longer crunchy, which was a bit of a disappointment. But I made this for several vegetarian friends who raved about it. Will definitely make again. Took the suggestion to bake the squash (baked it in the pan I would put the final lasagne in, so that saved some washing up), rather than peel and sauting. Worked well.

Very yummy!! A definite keeper. It took a little while to prepare. To cut down prep time, I roasted the squash in the oven and then scooped out the flesh and added it to the onions. I used pecans in place of hazelnuts. Next time I will decrease the amount of cheese (it was very cheesy) and saute the sage at the end of the cooking time with the onions.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this does take some time. I used olive oil instead of butter and that worked just fine. I also used a variety of nuts, including hazelnuts, brazilnuts, cashews etc. I also used regular lasagne noodles and cooked them first. I made the dish the day before, assembled it, and put it in the fridge with no problems. I liked this dish but didn't love it and so I'm not sure it was worth all the time. However, I might make it again for vegetarian company.

This recipe was PHENOMENAL!!!! And I agree with previous reviewers, it is after all a Lasagne recipe and therefore is going to take a little time to prepare. That said, it really wasn't difficult at all and it turned out wonderfully! I must say, I am generally a "stick to the original recipe the first time around" gal but I was craving this recipe and had not gone to the store for ingredients. So, knowing that I would need to be substituting for a myriad of ingredients, I did not have a high expectation level for this one due to my own lack of planning! I halved the recipe as I was cooking for one (makes for great breakfast leftovers, let me tell you!). I substituted the fresh herbs with dried with the exception of the garlic and didn't even have the correct ones dried (had to use reconstituted dried chopped onion, a little savory and some poultry seasoning ~ call me a heathen, I know, but I hadn't been to the store!), used a mixture of fat-free half & half and water for the milk, and used pecans instead of hazelnuts. BUT, even after all that alchemy, this recipe STILL turned out terrific! I can't wait to try it in it's original form and follow the recipe to the letter next time.

All lasagne is time consuming, this isn't difficult at all. Some hints: Half the squash and then microwave it on high for 1 minute - that makes it easier to cut. Cut in quarters, remove seeds, cut deep slahes in the flesh. Put on aluminum foiled baking sheet, flesh side up. Toss a peeled quarterd onion and 3 unpeeled cloves of garlic with 1 tsp oil and add to squash, onion, cut side down. Bake 45 to 60 minutes or until soft. The hardest part is waiting for the squash to cool so you can handle it. While the squash is cooking stick the hazelnuts in the oven for 4-5 minubtes. Then put them in a clean dish cloth and rub well - most of the skins will come off. Chop the nuts in a small cuisinart and use the same machine to chop the onion and garlic(pressed out of skin). This is an oustanding recipe - it is very light so does only serve six. As others said, do increase the salt and sage.

Okay, I admit it ... I was a sceptic about squash and nuts in lasagna. But this! This is amazing!! Having read many of the reviews first, I decided increased the onion and garlic many-fold, then roasted the squash, onions and garlic with a little olive oil. Excellent suggestions, everyone! I did use the hazelnuts, but ground them up to incorporate better in the mix, which turned out extremely well. Absolutely use fresh sage for this dish. For all the effort (and it was time-consuming), this is well worth it. Hubby loved it - I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks!

I have made this recipe several times and while it is labor-intensive in terms of peeling and chopping the squash, everyone loves it and begs for the recipe. Perfect for a dinner party of mixed company - vegetarians and meat-eaters. Rich and satisfying but no meat in sight. Each time, I have omitted the hazlenuts due to concerns that some guests may be allergic or simply dislike the intense flavor of the hazlenut. No complaints, to say the least!

It's delicious. I followed the advise of other cooks and increased the amounts of sage and garlic and added nutmeg to the roux. The sauce seemed awfully thin to me, but worked just fine, so don't panic and try to thicken it. By pouring it directly onto the no-boil lasagne and making sure that every bit of noodle is moistened by it, you won't get that rubbery pasta problem people have mentioned. The dish looked just like the picture and everyone loved it.

I made this for the 2nd time last night. I only had 9 noodles (instead of 12) which I boiled for 5 minutes first and only used 1/3 C of hazelnuts (I'm way too cheap to throw $5 worth of nuts into what is otherwise a very economical dish). It is delicious. Even my Atkins conscious dinner guests had seconds (much to my dismay as I was hoping for the leftovers!)

I made this lasagne for the first time shortly after the recipe was published in the magazine. I am a personal chef and lasagne is a standard request from many of my clients, mostly busy families. I tried this one out on my mom, who is pretty traditional. She was very skeptical, as she wached me prepare it in her kitchen, but she loved it and she still raves about it! It has become a standard "dressy" lasagne on my client menus - even the kids like it! As a chef, I substitute and change ingredients around frequently, but I don't change a thing on this one. It really is perfect.

WOW. I'm eating leftovers right now and am tempted to just polish off the whole thing right out of the pan. Totally worth the effort (also worth buying pre-diced squash if you can find it). AND worth using fresh noodles. Only other tweaks: don't be shy with the sage, and use way way way way more garlic.

Rating: 4
First off, I did not use the rubber no-boil pasta. The idea seems stupid when the real thing is so easy to cook. Second, I roasted the squash and onions in the oven to intensify the flavors and free up my time. I made all of the components the morning of the dinner party and then assembled just before baking. The flavors were so delicate and delicious. This is a lot of work, even with buying the pre-cut and pre-peeled squash. We thought the amount of sage was just right. I also added some thyme to balance it out. This was very elegant. I recommend letting it sit more than 5 minutes to let it firm up. Those who had second helpings had a much easier time serving as it held together better after it sat for 15 minutes.

I would rate this 5 stars if it were possible, it was that good. I made it on Thanksgiving and four of us finished it all. I can't get butternut squash in Luxembourg but used a local equivalent that required considerably more cooking - the results were just as fine. Worth the prep work!

Rating: 3
I liked this recipe a lot because it is so different from other "fall" flavor combinations and so unique compared to other vegetarian lasagnas. Cubing all that squash was a ton of work, but otherwise the recipe was excellent for preparing in steps in advance. I made the sauce and filling and grated the cheeses all 1-2 days in advance, and then it was easy to assemble before my party, and then just pop in the oven as guests were arriving. Being refrigerated, it did need an extra 15 minutes in the oven though. Also, the sauce will soak down through the layers, so make sure there is enough to pour on the top layer as the final step - my top noodles were just a bit stiff. Otherwise, I think this is delicious and impressive. I don't see why it couldn't be made with frozen cooked squash. The cubes were pretty, but I mostly liked them for the color which frozen squash would have as well - that would save a lot of work. Finally, this was served as part of a buffet, and I liked it that way because the pieces could be smaller. In larger quantities, the sqaush would be very rich, but I will definitely serve this again to guests.

I made this for 6, which left lots of fabulous leftovers. It was excellent. I added nutmeg to both the squash and sauce (as suggested by others, and I added chicken broth to the squash while it was cooking--it gave it a wonderful flavor and helped soften the squash. Definitely repeatable!

This is a winner. I used only 4 c. of milk (2%) to make the bechamel sauce and substituted slivered almonds which I toasted for the hazelnuts. The almonds were wonderful with the squash and because they were already slivered a good, easy substitution. Previous reviews were dead on--it was pretty labor intensive. I even par-roasted the squash to make it easier to slice off the peel but the whole recipe took 2 and 1/2 hours. Well worth it, though. Next time I may experiment and add a little sliced proscuitto to the squash.

Made this with frozen squash and it was very tasty, but extremely labor-intensive and found the hazelnuts to be too much.

Fantastic recipe. This dish was beautiful and delicious. For those who thought it was bland or too hard and took too long to make, I thought I would share a few shortcuts. Bland - increase spices and double up on garlic and onion. I also added a little nutmeg to the roux which is always wonderful. Too much work - forget about removing hazelnut skins - they looked great in the recipe. I also sprayed nuts with a little olive oil and sprinkled with salt before putting in the oven to toast. Buy peeled and cubed butternut squash and pre chopped onion in the fridge section of the grocer, and fresh lasagna sheets are better than the no cooked ones in the box. One hours prep time was all that was needed.

I was curious regarding the disparity of reviews for this recipe and I felt compelled to comment. If you are using a typical baked tomato-based lasagna with meat sauce as your frame of reference for this recipe, you will undoubtedly be disappointed. This is very subtle and sophisticated flavor. The sage and garlic paired beautifully with the sweetness of the squash, and richness of the sauce. Would recommend serving with an off dry wine such as an Alsatian pinot gris or Voigner. My guests found it delightful and delicious!

Even better than I expected! The comination in this recipe intrigued me, and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't think this was all that much work. I used pecans instead of hazelnuts, as that was what I had on-hand. I also didn't toast them in the oven. I just microwaved them for a little bit to hint at that toasted flavor. I thought it was delicious, and I'll definitely make it again.

A wonderful fall entree!! Skim milk worked fine...Also, I roasted the butternut squash whole in a 425 oven until very dark brown on the outside-let cool, chopped and then made the filling. I was able to cut down on all but a T of the butter in the filling this way (and all of the hard work peeling and chopping the squash). The squash had a wonderful, sweet, nutty flavor with almost none of the effort (although I suppose some of the texture was lost). I accidently didn't buy no-boil pasta and it turned out fine. I think pumpkin and sweet potato would also work alone or in combo in this dish. Your dinner guests will really be impressed!

Absolutely delicious! A great change from the usual tomato-based lasagnes and perfect for a vegetarian meal. Notes on the cooking...cut time by buying already roasted and peeled hazelnuts, reduce calories without reducing taste or texture by using 1% or nonfat milk instead of whole milk (it thickens just as well), and do not skimp out on the fresh blocks of butternut squash--one reviewer suggested pumpkin puree, but I think that would destroy the recipe's texture.

I first cooked this dish for a dinner party and it went down very well. It has to be one of the best dishes I have ever tried but it was lucky that I had all of Friday night free to do as much of the prep as possible - it was rather labour and time intensive and created lots of washing up but I will definitely make it again when I have the time. I have to say it was great for a dinner party as you can do alot of the work the day before.

Wow, this is an amazing dish. I followed the directions exactly, with no substitutions or additions, except that I cooked it in two square glass dishes (all I had). The hazelnuts are a must--they really compliment the squash perfectly. I took some reveiwers' advice and microwaved the squash before cutting it into cubes. I will definitely be making this again!

Really liked this (my husband liked it more than me), although a lot of work. Bought hazelnuts that were already peeled. Next time i'll use pine nuts, i think they'd be better. Didn't have a bay leaf and think it probably really needed it. I also may substitute ricotta next time, as the fresh grated mozzarella took on the texture of ricotta. Overall, delicious, and with advance prep, definitely worth the effort.

What is no boil lasagna? Do I cook the noodles first?

This recipe took a little longer, but there are some shortcuts that eliminate the hard work. First, buy packaged hazelnuts that are already chopped. I found them in the baking section at the supermarket with the other nuts. I just spread them out on a tray and toasted them lightly in the toaster oven. Next, buy pre-peeled and cored butternut squash. I found this in the produce section sealed in plastic. All you have to do is chop it up. The rest of the tasks are pretty manageable and the lasagne is delicious.

Next time, I'd make extra sauce--the top layer of lasagna didn't quite have enough liquid to soak up. Also, use more cheese. It takes a long time to cut up the squash...good but not quite worth the effort.

I just completed this very time consuming recipe for dinner tonight. Since I haven't eaten it yet, I can't rate how many forks it should have, but our daughter made it and raved about it. So I am sure that we will love it. She said that the hazelnuts were difficult to work with and the skins didn't all come off, so I told her to use pinenuts next time. I like their flavor better anyway. That is what I did, and I put them in with the onions when I sauteed them. The squash is another matter. I cut it in quarters and baked it thinking that it would be easy to scoop out, but it took a long time to do. It was still too firm to scoop. Next time I would probably just peel it as directed, cook it a little longer, and mash it slightly. My other suggestion would be to get the food processor out and use it for the onion, sage, and cheese to cut down on prep time. The fresh mozzarella was hard to grate by hand.

A lot of work but worth it. Next time will use pecans and cut the squash in smaller pieces.

I substituted pinenuts (lightly toasted) for the hazelnuts since I have a hard time finding the latter fresh enough. It saved chopping or dealing with the nut skins. The pinenuts were HEAVENLY! I couldn't find the par-boiled pasta so only cooked mine 1/2 way but the sauce still ended up too thin. Next time I'll do that part different. It got rave reviews from our Christmas guests.

My dinner party just adored this dish..I don't think it was too rich, as a matter of fact, it was just perfect. Rather than cooking the squash and garlic on the stovetop, I slow roasted them in the oven, giving them a deep, rich taste. I didn't quite have enought hazelnuts so I also toasted a few pecans--great combination. I had a bit of bleu cheese on hand so I also added that into the cheese mixture--it was heavenly! It didn't take that long to make and even less time to devour! Served the lasagne with a nice crisp bitter salad and tossed in with a nice homemade vinaigrette. Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is outstanding!! The flavors are perfect together even though it sounds wierd. Definately use the no boil pasta; we first made it with boiled lasagne noodles and it came out too runny. I'm making it again for a dinner party tomorrow!! I really can't rave enough about this- it's wonderful!!!

Slightly sweet and tasty but you don't want to eat a lot of it. My husband loves leftovers but has left this untouched in the fridge. I might make this as an extra dish for a pot luck but never again as a main course. It's too much work for the effort.

This was heavenly! Served it to a group of very talented cooks and they raved. My husband said it was (almost) better than sex!

Wow,this was amazing! Even better left over the next day. Even my picky 15yr old daughter loved it! (though she did say it looked gross) I cut the squash into pieces then microwaved to soften a bit, then peeled and chopped. Made it a little easier. Will definitely make this again!

Unique change of pace lasagna dish. A little too rich for my taste.

Rating: 4
Great dish -- BUT do when you have time to spare. Prep time is long: I roasted the butternut squash (halved, fork-pricked and roasted for approx 30-45 min) then cubed it. Then toasting and peeling the hazelnuts took some time (may not have toasted them long enough because half the peel remained on most, nevertheless, this did not detract from the flavor). Agree w/other review that it'd be easier to prep ingredients a day before baking.

I thought this recipe was delicious! My kids didn't seem to enjoy it as much as my husband and I but I think the flavors are a little advanced for their young taste buds. I would and have recommended this recipe to others. The hazelnuts and cream sauce are the "bonus" flavors involved in this one.

It was a little more than we bargained for, as far as difficulty and time goes, but in the end it was definitely worth it. We did it all in one day, but I like the fact that there are steps you can do ahead of time. Next time, I think we'll take advantage of that fact

Wow. I pretty much followed this recipe to a T, and my husband and I were very impressed. I was worried that the sauce wasn't getting thick enough, but finally I gave up and just poured it on. It came out perfectly. The final product looked beautiful and tasted even better. It made a LOT more than 4 servings -- the two of us have eaten it for 4 meals and still have some left in the freezer (note: it gets better every time we eat it). A bit of an effort (we had to shell the hazelnuts ourselves and I attacked the raw squash rather than sticking it in the microwave), but it's definitely worth making again if I take the necessary shortcuts.

I thought this tasted a little different,maybe too much for a full meal.I think with other main meals it would go just fine!

I was attracted to this recipe because of the roasted hazelnuts, and also trying to use squash in new ways. This recipe was delicious... the subtle flavors of the butternut squash combine very nicely with the hazelnuts,sage and cheese -- very unusual and something I don't think you'd find on too many restaurant menus either. It took longer to prepare than I anticipated (especially peeling/cutting squash, which I did cut in half and microwave to soften before peeling and cutting into cubes). Next time, I'll do this step the day before, as well as the sauce (and any other shredding or veg prep), that way all there is to do when ready to bake is layer it in the pan. My husband loved the taste also and there was enough for several meals. To the reader looking for Buffalo Mozzarella, I've seen this product at Costo Wholesale(if you have those up there!)

I'm now very tempted to try this recipe, thanks to all the reviewers, I appreciate the suggestions (add spinach, microwave the butternut squash and once softened, scoop out rather than peeling the hard raw squash, adjust the sage quantity to taste, add a bit of smoked mozarella, etc.) One thing I thought I'd throw out there: it's been my experience that the mozarella cheese available here is fairly tasteless. Yes, it melts, but that's about all. However, I have heard that the Buffalo mozarella you can buy in the Italian deli's in New Jersey is fantastic, so I'd really like to try that with this recipe. Anyone out there know where I can find this great Italian 'Buffalo mozarella' in Toronto? I'll travel as far as Little Italy or Woodbridge :D .... thanks!!

My mother made this for Christmas dinner. I was skeptical, I'm not a big squash fan, but it was fantastic! The nuts give it just the right amount of texture. The trick for us was waiting the extra minutes to let it set after removing it from the oven. It kept it from being too runny.

I made this for my husband's birthday last week,and although it took me two hours to make, he loved it. I think it was just peeling and chopping the squash that took the longest. Since there's just the two of us, we ate it 3 nights in a row-but it was at its' most delicious the third night. Shalini

Subtle but flavorful. My sauce didn't thicken very much and I contemplated adding more roux, but didn't. The result was just right and I'm glad I didn't over-thicken it. I followed the other cooks suggestions and pre-cooked the butternut squash then sauteed until very soft. So the squash layer was more mashed than chunky. yummy.

This was my first attempt at a meatless lasagne and it was great! The flavors are subtle but definitely there- would highly reccommend this for your vegetarian friends!

This is a tasty comfort-food dish made a little elegant due to the hazelnuts. I added 16 oz. frozen spinach (sauteed first) to the butternut squash mixture--it added more texture and color.

This might have gotten 3 forks if I had made it correctly. I missed the bit about whisking the sauce as it boiled and it didn't thicken so I repeated this step in another pot. By this time, the sause had twice the flour and butter and was quite thick. I only put half the sauce in the dish to avoid too much richness. I should have put it all in because the end result was a bit dry. Also, longer cooking and smaller pieces for the squash would be an improvement. I agree with those who said this a bit bland and could use a bit more seasoning. Still, a very unique, good dish we had no trouble eating. I would make it again.

Very, very interesting ~ the butternut squash caused it to be a lot 'sweeter' than the ingredients suggested. I would certainly experiment with a combination of fresh herbs b4 presenting the final dish for a group that we would want to 'WOW'.

Delicious! The flavors were unique and the hazelnuts were a great addition. The sage is so good with winter squash. The recipe portions are large-I split it in half and it served 4 with plenty of extra

Okay--maybe I did something wrong..maybe I don't like hazelnuts and sage.. I found these two flavors overpowering and the dish too rich.

A little bland. I will use more sage next time. My daughter thinks I should use pecans instead of hazelnuts and I'll try it that next time. Definitely will make again.

I baked the squash in the oven then added it, mashed, to the onion mix. I had no mozzarella, used 2 c. of non fat cottage cheese instead and it was fine. I cut down on the sage as was suggested. Loved this recipe. I'd serve this to company. It was better day two!

This lasagne "wowed" my husband and friends that came over for dinner last night. It was fairly easy to assemble as well. The only thing I recommend is to take your squash, cut in half lengthwise and microwave until somewhat tender-it is just easier to peel and dice that way as well as cuts down on the sautee time. I would also increase the cheese measurement a little bit. Make sure your herbs are fresh, it makes all the difference! I am going to make it again for a small get together on Christmas Eve for family! I loved it......If you want something different, go for it, it tastes like something off the special menu at your favorite restaurant!

3.5 forks! I didn't have Parmesan, so used Romano instead. Also, I cooked the squash for a bit more than 15 min, but should have waited a little longer since the end result was crunchier than perfect. That said, there's something heavenly about the combo of squash and hazelnuts and the fresh mozzarella. Definitely worth the effort.

A very tasty variation to lasagne. I used regular lasagne noodles and pre-boiled them. Since I'm allergic to hazelnuts I used toasted walnuts. I had a little smoked mozzarella left in my refrigerator, so I threw some of that in. In my opinion the smoked mozzarella really helped to bring out the flavors and made it really interesting. I didn't use much, a little goes a long way.

I thought this recipe was just about perfect as written except that I had to cook the squash filling for much longer than 15 minutes. A great dish for a winter evening; I'll definitely make it again.

I really liked this dish and would make it for company. It did take about 25 minutes to cook the filling so I would "nuke' the squash for a few minutes the next time I make it. I used the Barilla no-boil lasagna recommended in the issue but I prefer regular lasagna noodles - I haven't preboiled them in years! I use them straight from the package and they're just fine.

Very unusual flavors -- and very yummy! Perhaps the reason other reviewers don't like this recipe is that they don't like the ingredients in the first place? If you're expecting a typical lasagne, don't make this. If you're looking for something new and different, then do make this! The combination of crunchy hazelnuts, smooth squash, and creamy cheese, etc. makes a rich and hearty winter meal.

I agree, the chunks could be smaller.... and maybe a bit less sage, but I used Italian and Fine herb mixes as well (about a tbsp each) and found this added extra, yet more balanced flavour. I cooked this for a dinner party and it was an undeniable hit.

The recipe is full of squash flavor, which should make it delicious. And true to lasagne, the dish was better the next day. However, the texture of the squash was off-putting. If I were to make it again (unlikely), I would cut the squash into smaller cubes, and then possibly puree the contents of the skillet before combining them with the nuts and herbs.

Loved taste of this lasagne. Only change I made was to microwave the butternut squash for about two or three minutes and then cut it open and scooped out squash. Otherwise, butternut squash is too hard to peel and cut. Obviously, it cut down on prep time and I don't think if effected the taste.

Wonderful dish. I am not a fan of meatless lasagne, but this dish is amazing. Perfect blending of flavors. I added an additional teaspoon of sage to the filling to enhance the flavor of the squash. Don't skimp on the mozzarella, be sure to use fresh cheese. The filling took me about 25 minutes to thicken to the proper consistancy (not the 10 the recipe says). Would definitely make this dish again and again, it's a new favorite.
