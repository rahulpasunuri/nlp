Followed recipe for the dressing exactly. Used herb salad mix instead of radicchio & spinach. Really delicious, plenty of dressing left over for another salad the next day. Yum.

This salad was wonderful. The spinach balanced the bitterness of the radicchio and the fennel rounded out the flavor (just make sure to grind the fennel seeds completely). Everyone loved it!

The salad itself was great. I'd make it again, HOWEVER - next time I do am going to leave out the fennel. It didn't seem to go with the overall flavors of the salad - I used less than recommended in the recipe, yet it still seemed to take over. My guests said that they were enjoying it until they got a bite of the fennel - which ruined the taste of the salad.
