This is really delicious. As others have said, it's the taste of late summer baked in a pie. I was afraid of a soggy bottom crust, so I drained the tomatoes for about an hour before assembling the pie. It worked. The biscuit crust is good, but this recipe has more steps and ingredients than it appears to, and I think a store-bought pie crust would work, too. I'd have given it four forks except that it's messy and time-consuming to put together. I'll still make it again, though.

Love this recipe. I notice that some said crust was soggy but mine was not at all. Such a good way to use tomatoes when they are fresh from the garden.

Thank God for the previous reviewers! Thanks to them I used premade pie crust and prebaked the bottom crust. No mushy, soggy bottom! Diced and salted the tomatoes and let them drain in a colander for 30 minutes and then a final pat with paper towels. No need to puree the corn. Mixed the tomatoes and corn with a little diced Vidalia onion then the mayo mix and cheese. No need to layer. I'm sure the biscuit crust was superior but this was faster and easier for a weeknight side dish. Great flavors with native tomatoes and corn.

I use whatever herbs are growing on the patio - basil, parsley and tarragon. I add 2-3 thinly sliced green onions and a generous teaspoon of dijon mustard to the mayo dressing mixture. I mix the dressing directly with the corn (which I've usually grilled the day before). Then I combine. Tomatoes, corn/dressing, cheese; tom - corn - cheese; and final layer of tomato. Pre-made pie crust makes this simple, fast and delicious. Everyone asks me for the recipe.

I liked it made with changes suggested by several reviewers. I did a top crust only, dropped on not rolled out. I chopped the tomatoes and omitted the mayonnaise mixture. I added chives to the crust and it was a big hit

I made this with fresh corn and tomatoes from the farmer's market. I didn't realize until I started cooking that I didn't have enough cheddar so I substituted w/ mozzarella (~1 cup) and it still turned out great! I will definitely be making this again.

I put the corn on the grill briefly before putting it in the pie and it added a delicious smoky flavor. I also patted the tomato slices dry a little bit with dishtowels to make the whole thing less soggy (per other people's comments). All in all it was a great recipe, and I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I did not peel the tomatoes. I salted the sliced tomatoes and let them drain for a couple of hours. I put corn on the bottom to help prevent sogginess. I used a little less cheese because the pie plate was getting so full. The bottom crust wasn't super crisp, but it wasn't a soggy mess, either. I will definitely make this again.

Tastes like "summertime in your mouth." This has become one of my favorite dishes of summer at our farm. I usually skip the top crust and add more cheddar on top,which works well.

I liked this, but I don't think I'll make it again--it was a bit over the top for me. I didn't think the corn should have been processed. The texture was odd and I would have preferred whole kernels. Also, I made a big mistake and rolled the dough between wax paper rather than plastic (ugh!). It stuck and I had to repeat the process. I definitely think a premade crust would work. Although I have to admit the biscuit crust was very tasty.

Really loved the flavors of this dish. Simple and summery with the use of garden fresh tomatoes and herbs. Turned out watery for me though, even though I drained the heck out of the tomatoes. I believe the water came from the corn which needs to be drained thoroughly. I used worchester sauce as a condiment but would have been great to add before baking. Double the basil also. I used store bought crust which turned out great. I will definitely try this again, with some revisions.

If you don't like this dish, then you don't like summer. I made the pie as is (except I forgot to puree the corn), and it was sublime! I purchase fresh Jersey tomatoes and corn at the Green Market along with a quality, aged cheddar. I'm not always successful with pastry dough, but the biscuit crust proved much easier for me. I served this as a main with sauteed wild spinach, and the leftovers were tasty too. This will give me something to dream about during New York winters.

I made a few changes - intentional and unintentional. The change I highly recommend was to make it like a cobbler - with all the biscuit dough on top - instead of as a pie. Same baking time, and I just dropped spoonfuls of dough instead of rolling it out. No soggy crust! I left out the cheese - the topping had all the fat I could justify. I recommend that too -- the flavors were very fresh and clear. I forgot to puree the corn. (Though I did get it on the table in about an hour.) It worked fine but without the cheese and the puree the filling did not hold together at all. I think I'll make it the same way again but mix in a bit of flour to thicken the juices a bit. I'll be making this all summer.

Great recipe! Made this last night with perfect tomatoes and white corn from the farmers market, and 4 of us practically fought over the last slice. I didn't peel the tomatoes, and I used more basil and omitted the chives (only because I didn't have any). I'm not much of a baker, and the crust isn't difficult to work with. I'd make it again today if I wasn't afraid I'd eat the whole thing myself. ;)

Short cut - use premade pie crust, if need be. This is a winner!! It reheats GREAT!

Followed exactly and the result is very tasty. Next time, I'll drain the tomatoes, though, since my result was very watery. Good thing I drained the corn after processing, or there wouldn't be any bottom crust.

I drained tomatoes, used a supersweet corn, extra basil and garlic chives. Delicious! I did not find it necessary to use the plastic for rolling out the crust. Definitely will make this again and again.

This dish was surprisingly easy to make and didn't take too much time as it seemed like. I used Wisconsin sharp cheddar that I shredded myself rather than using the one comes in the bag already shredded. I regretted not having enough basil leaves on hand, yet definitely a crowd pleaser.

I made this pie last summer and it was the talk of the town. Made it again last night and it was just as wonderful. Used fresh basil from our garden (I double the basil in the recipe). I used low fat mayo unbeknownst to my husband. I used an egg yoke to brush the top and it browned beautifully.

I really didn't enjoy this dish but if I read the reviews like I usually do, I'm sure it would have turned out much better. I'll try it again but I will drain the tomatoes and leave out the mayo part.

Took the advice of some of the reviews below and chopped instead of sliced the tomatoes, mixed the ingredients together rather than layered, used yogurt instead of mayo, and spiced it all up with some cayenne in the sauce and some worchester sauce on the tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Biscuit crust was not soggy, and nice and crispy around the edges. Filling was, in a word, fantastic. Great American recipe. Served it to some pals from Chicago and they really loved it. Epicurious is a great site because of the recipes, becuase of the review comments and because of what it does for international relations. ;)

Love this pie. Would the cook from Valley Cottage, NY, care to share Laurie Colwin's recipe? Can't find it on epicurious.I tend to follow recipes to a T; thus I process the corn (makes a more delicate pie) and weigh and peel the beefsteaks (have never had sogginess). Made this practically all last summer. My teens and husband wolfed it down. I was recyling Gourmets on this cold spring New England day and started longing for this pie and real tomatoes. Yeah, there's some washing up to do, but it is so worth it.

I took this to a party a couple of weeks ago without trying it first, but it went over very well. Everyone really liked the biscuit crust; I did use more butter than the recipe called for. I used fresh herbs and homegrown tomatoes so the flavor was very summer-ish. I did use whole kernel frozen corn, didn't do anything to it beyond thawing it out. Changes for next time: it took twice as long to make than I had planned on; I would use less cheese and roughly chop the tomatoes, as a matter of personal preference; I would use plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise, and also add some garlic.

This made a handsome dish, but I wasn't crazy about the mayonaise flavor. Of course I'm not really a mayo fan. That said, I did really like it, especially the biscuit crust, which I found it to be a snap to roll it out using the plastic wrap as specified in the directions. I used tomatoes and herbs from my garden and local organic corn from the local farmstand which I had grilled the day before. I will try this again but am planning on using something other than the mayo -- maybe a little cream mixed in with the corn? I'd love suggestions! UPDATE: I made this again with the following changes and loved it. I substituted low-fat plain yogurt thinned with a little light cream I had on hand instead of the mayo-lemon juice. I mixed the yogurt with the cord and shredded cheese, and spread it over the tomtoes. I used fresh basil from the garden and it was delicious. Next time I will add snipped chives to the biscuit crust.

I thought this was delicious. It did seem to take up more time in preparation, than the recipe allotted. It took me about an hour and twenty minutes to completely assemble. But it was well worth it.

I was really looking forward to making this because it sounded so interesting and the reviews were all pretty good. I did everything right, even drained the tomatoes, but we thought this was just plain bad. The bottom crust was mushy, the tomatoes weren't cooked enough (even after 40 minutes), the flavors didn't come together at all, and it was VERY bland. The only positives were that the top crust and mayo spread were tasty. All in all, a big disappointment, especially after reading so many great reviews. Maybe I was expecting too much?!?!

The dough was wonderful, lite and tender. I roasted the corn first and left some it whole to add to the processed corn. Also used some wilted spinach, well drained in the pie. Only had colby-jack cheese on hand it it worked great. Went well with grilled chicken...Kids gobbled up all the leftovers before I had a chance!

This was an interesting recipe for me to try as I like to do more outlandish and extravagant dishes, but I'll tell ya, this one's for the books. I changed only two little things. I did half shortning and half butter for the crust and I added broccoli. I served the pie with sour cream and it was to die for!! I think I'd probably add a little more mayo next time. I seem to have had the opposite problem of other epicuriors (is that a word?) and it came out a hair too dry. Probably because of the broccoli, but the sour cream made up for it.

Delicious! - warmed up well alto bottom crust was a bit soggy. Recipe specified lbs. rather than number of tomatoes so used 4 large. Also did not say if they should be seeded/drained. Do not feel it is necessary to process the corn. Made crust in processor and was perfect.

I made this using really ripe salad tomatoes. Can't get beefsteaks in Madrid. There was no need to drain them. Instead of just shredded cheddar, I bought a bag of mixed cheeses. (cheddar, gouda, Swiss) The contrast in tastes was wonderful. It took me a lot longer than 40 min. to put this together, but I thought it was well worth the effort. Even the crust turned out, and was much easier to do than I thought! Perfect for family OR guests.

delicious and easy to make, although I wasn't happy with the concentration of cheese at the top of the pie. I would prefer to mix the cheese throughout -- and perhaps reduce the amount of cheese so it won't drown out the flavors of corn & tomato.

I also found this recipe to be a bit more labor intensive than expected. The crust was difficult to handle, and consequently, I was forced to eliminate the top crust. I substituted parrano cheese for cheddar and added fresh oregano, which I think worked well. All in all, tasty but not easy!

Rating: 3
I salted my tomato slices, laid them out on a rack, and let them drain for an hour. I then squeezed them a little and patted them dry with a paper towe. Had no problems with liquid. I left off the top crust, and I don't think I missed it. That said, I found this recipe much more labor intensive then I thought it would be a first glance, so be prepared to spend a little time.

Drain the tomatoes in a colander for at least an hour - it makes a huge difference

I don't think that I baked this long enough. The cheese looked unmelted, even though I baked it for 30 minutes (my ancient oven cooks hot). However, I didn't have any problem with watery tomatoes and I think the flavor is wonderful. Lacking a rolling pin, I purchased a quiche crust which worked well.

I have made this recipe 3 times now for guests and they have loved it. I made it with fresh heirloom tomatoes, fresh white corn, and I used a nice Sonoma chevre goat cheese instead of the cheddar. I did not put the corn through a food processor--just sliced it off the cobs and sprinkled it over the tomatoes--the crisp fresh corn made the recipe. I am still thinking about the mayonnaise and am sure I could come up with a lighter lemon sauce for the recipe. Mayo works though--I used a low-fat canola one. Use plenty of fresh basil--it needs the flavor.

I had no trouble with this recipe being too watery, but I did end up letting my tomatoes drain as I was attempting to watch my son at the same time as making this pie. The only thing I changed was to use less cheese and it still came out great. My husband and two year old loved it, so we will definitely be making it again.

While this was an interesting recipe and tasted pretty good, I don't think I would bother making it again. I would advise a couple of changes to those who are interested in making the pie. Number one, the suggestion to drain tomatoes with some salt beforehand is a good one. My pie was not too soggy as others had complained. Number two, 1 3/4 teaspoon salt for the crust is too much. No more than 1 1/4 teaspoon salt is needed. I enjoyed the mayo/cheese part of the pie, as it thickened it somewhat. But the whole pie was too labor intensive and the results not that outstanding for me to want to make it again.

Rating: 2
This was good. I would definitely down size the mayo. It's extremely rich. I would make this as a starter and just cut slivers of pie.

I don't usually make significant changes in a Gourmet or Bon Appetit recipe, but I decided to have this on the spur of the moment and didn't want to go to the store for what I was missing. Therefore I used Gruyere cheese instead of Cheddar, which turned out to be delicious. I also used a store-bought frozen pastry-crust and added sliced onions. Yum! Next time I will take the reviewer's suggestion of draining the tomatoes and I anticipate that this will then be perfect. We enjoyed this with a grilled steak and a good bottle of Cabernet. Great one-dish side!

I'd prefer a fresh corn, tomato and basil salad over this recipe any time. A bit soggy and the crust was somewhat sweet which I didn't enjoy with the other flavors.

I have not made this particular pie but it sounds very similar to the one that I make. To keep the pie from being too soggy I peel and slice the tomatoes at least an hour in advance and then layer them in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Of course the longer they drain the less soggy your pie will be. It works!

well, i was torn on this review - i love the combo of tomatoes and corn and the crust was very good - but it was watery, even after chilling and the mayo combo was just to rich for my taste - i think the basic concept is there - but need to figure out a different binder without making this quiche like -

I've made this again and again but with a slight twist. Since we don't like a lot of crust, I top the tomatoes (we add onions and peppers) with the mayo and shredded cheese and spread around to cover the tomatoes. I add tabasco to the cheese topping, too. Yum!

My sister and I have been making the original recipe (without the corn) every year since 1992(it is now an annual family ritual). We consider it an absolute treasure. We never peel the tomatoes. We would never consider reducing the lemon juice or the mayo. It is perfect as it is. The one issue is that the tomatoes produce a tremendous amount of liquid and so we often have to take out some of the liquid before serving. It's better when it's reheated and a bit less wet.

Rating: 3
This is a DELICIOUS recipe. I will definately be making it again and again. I liked the lemon mayo, but used only one tablespoon of the lemon juice, and it was perfect. As I made this for dinner, I aded very thinly sliced potatoes, cooked it covered for an hour, then added the melted butter and cooked it uncovered for 15 mins. The crust is great. Perfect for chronic experimentors like me! Yum! PS: Do not attempt with winter tomatoes. Use a different vegetable that is in season.

This is very good, nice flavour from the fresh basil. I'm not sure about the lemon mayo - it does give it a nice tang, but is a bit overpowering. I think maybe yogurt or sour cream would work in its place?
