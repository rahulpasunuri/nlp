Do NOT try to grill soft (Mexican style) chorizo! It makes a mess. Perhaps, the harder (Spanish style) chorizo would work better. The sauce, steak, and shrimp are good.

I threaded 2 pieces of spicy German sausage and 2 cooked shrimps onto a skewer and served cold with the sauce. Fabulous!

This recipe not only serves a good amount of people, it is easy and is better when made in advance. I recommend making the Chimichurri Sauce 2-3 days in advance and the skewers at least 1 day in advance. I agree with a prior review that the Chimichurri Sauce has significantly less garlic than a traditional Chimichurri Sauce, however, after it sits for a day or two it is fantastic in it's own right and doesn't overpower the meat that is prepared in such a basic manner.

I tried this recipe last weekend, and my family went absolutely wild! It was phenomenal. The chimichurri sauce is so robust & flavorful that it really was a "symphony of flavor", as my fiance' put it! It's a recipe that will definitely stay at arm's length to be used repeatedly. Thanks for the great recipe!

this is great! very green and zesty with the jalapenos. but I must say, it needs more garlic. at least 5-6 cloves to be a true chinichurri. i made this for grilled porterhouse steaks, and it was delicious.
