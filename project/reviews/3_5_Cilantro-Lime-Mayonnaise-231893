Not a bad recipe, but the cilantro was completely overpowered by the other ingredients. Don't know what "killed" it - the lime, the mustard, the garlic? Well, the sauce is green, but the color is all that was left of the cilantro. Maybe my cilantro was "weak" and my mayo too "strong and spicy" to begin with. I'm slightly disappointed, but I guess there's no way to adjust the recipe to have the herb come out.

I was a little worried when I tasted the sauce straight -- rather piquant -- but it went very well on salmon cakes. In the future I might cut the line juice in half to make it thicker, but this is a great way to use all the cilantro that's been available at the farmer's market

I stuff pasilla peppers with a mix of shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes and chopped cilantro, then put them under the broiler until the cheese melts and they collapse a bit. Then I serve them with a dollop of this mayonnaise on top. The lime in the mayonnaise offsets the heat of the peppers beautifully and I ALWAYS get rave reviews. This recipe is really versatile and can be served with just about any kind of broiled fish.

This was very good. We had it with the Shrimp Cakes from this site. Hubby took the rest of the sauce with him to work to go with the chicken he is having for lunch.

Great with cold poached salmon, hot grilled salmon, sliced chicken sandwiches, garnish for fresh tomatoes, and probably many uses limited only by the amount on hand.

Yum!! This is quick, easy and terrific with the scallop cakes. My guests scraped their plates. I'm looking forward to having this in my repertoire for other seafood dishes. A new keeper for me!

Quick and great. The taste is fresh, and a great complement to baked salmon. The pretty pale green color is an added bonus.

Thanks to the suggestion of others I made a thicker sauce. Just cut the lime juice down to 1 tablespoon and blend in a bowl with a whisk instead of the food processor.

Good recipe, though additional binder definitely needed. I often use a few scallops to extend my "crab cakes" by mimic lumping crab and save a few $$. I usually par-cook and drain very well. I also use cilantro instead of parsely in the crab/scallop mix itself. Chilling mix for at least an hour before forming cakes helps, as does rolling the formed cakes in bread or panko crumbs and re-chilling for a couple of hours. Instead of hot-sauce in the mayo, try a dab of the adobo sauce from a can of chipotles.

This is a very easy and flavorfull sauce. Goes great with the scallop cakes. I plan to try it on tuna burgers but will need to make it a little thicker.

This sauce is very simple and has great flavor. Goes great with the scallop cakes. I plan to try it on tuna burgers but I just need to figure out how to keep it on the thicker side.
