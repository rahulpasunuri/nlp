I could have spackled my wall with this dish...what did I do wrong??

Loved it, but WAY too much chestnut liquid needed to be added to the potatoes. When I make again I will cut the half and half down to 3/4 or half a quart. Otherwise, a HUGE hit.

Delicious! Very delicate taste. I did change the recipe: I used fresh chestnuts, which I boiled for 20 min and then peeled. I also used a bit less half and half. I would make this dish again. I am sure it will be a big hit tomorrow at our friend's Thanksgiving dinner.
