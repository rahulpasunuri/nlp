The taste of the fritters and syrup is excellent. But I could not get them to fry through all the way without burning. Most were raw in the middle no matter how small I made them. I was doing it on a stove top and not a professional deep fryer but can usually do fried food just fine. Used regular vanilla yogurt not soy and cloves/cinnamon instead of mace. I will try these again if I can figure out how to get them to fry through. Not sure if it was the frying technique or the consistency of the dough.

this was fantastic! i made it for my holiday dinner party last year and everyone raved! i made the batter and syrup ahead of time. while coffee and tea water was heating i warmed the syrup and fried the batter cook time was perfect. served this hot with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream to the side
