Nothing like bottled roasted peppers. Buy the rest, but make this from scratch for your antipasto. (BTW, it says marinate only 30 minutes. I say, marinate longer if you want judged by it being just as good a day later.

Truly delicious! Love roasted veggies as they take on such a sweet/mellow flavour. Made on a gas barbeque and used a mix of red, green and yellow peppers resulting in a very colourful dish. Wouldn't change a thing and if you are a pepper lover, this is a great way to prepare them. Enjoy!

Delicious as a side dish, as part of an antipasto, and also wonderful in sandwiches the next day! They taste just as my mother-in-law makes them...she's Sicilian!
