I'm sorry to say, this little baby is just ugly. What was I thinking? It's pureed black beans. Anyway, the flavor is good. Altogether, 2 forks for not having enough umph to overcome the bad looks.

Very bland--no one ate it at the tailgate, including me. There are so many better black bean dip recipes.

I was unimpressed with this recipe. Made it as one of three apps for a Mexican themed dinner and it didn't go over very well.

This is something like my "Texas Caviar" recipe, which my friends think is great! E-mail me if you would like the recipe...... equipage@webtv.net

The addition of some Tabasco sauce and cilantro was a big improvement

I made this for a mexican-themed girls card party and took the advice of a previous reviewer and added a flavorful picante sauce, plus 1/2 cup chopped cilantro. It still needed more flavor for my taste, so I added additional cumim and some chili powder. Definitely better after chilling for some time and I may add either chopped chilies or jalapenos the next time around.

I gave a rating of "2" before I added medium picante sauce. It seemed to be in need of a little more "spice." After the addition, I'd give it a "3."

Not bad, but it wasn't as good as I had anticipated. Maybe with a little adjusting it could be better. It is nicely complimented by pita toast points.

I doubled this recipe for an hors d'oeuvre party of 20. Very little was left. Everybody loved it.
