I made this for the 4th and it was excellent. I followed the recipe to the letter. The only thing I would do differently next time is not to marinate the salmon for 10 minutes and perhaps not at all. The high acidity from the lemon began to "cook" the fish and it was not as translucent as I prefer (although the grill was very hot). So long as you pour the juices of the relish over the salmon as you serve it, you'll get plenty of flavor. I served with swiss chard and grilled corn.

Excellent meal on the patio with friends Easy to do. Salsa can be prepared well in advance. Simple summer fare, but our friends walked off asking for the salsa recipe.

The ONLY way my husband will eat salmon since I first made it over 10 years ago! Great salsa recipe - very forgiving. Sometimes I use lime juice, or red onion instead of shallots if they aren't onhand. The marinade works well with any cut of fish, but if you buy king salmon (chinook) or other wild salmon, you may want to pre-portion into smaller fillets or steaks before grilling. (Wild salmon is up to 2.5" thicker). *** WTTW: ONLY USE FRESH FISH FOR THIS RECIPE. It's designed to let the flavor of the fish really shine through.

This was delicious and easy. The salsa would be good with anything. Leftovers the next day with the salmon mixed in with the salsa as a salad was great.

This is my absolute favorite salmon recipe ever. The combination of flavors in the salsa definitely complement the grilled salmon. When grilling the salmon make sure you put plenty of the remaining marinade on the fish to keep it moist. This one isn't just a keeper, it is a staple in our home. GIVE IT A TRY!

I love this recipe. The salsa is fresh and delicious. The cumin gives a bit of latin flavor.

I would definitely make this again. I served it over the hard black kind of wild rice and I thought it went well. My suggestions would be to dice the salsa ingredients quite small and also to set the grill on medium rather than high. It was my first instinct to use a lot of heat and that didn't work.

I loved this but I seemed to be the only one. Everyone else liked it but were indifferent to the idea of eating it again. Followed the recipe to a tee and thought the salsa was a nice complement to the salmon.

Really loved this dish!! I ended up serving the salmon and salsa over some whole wheat pasta and with a side of grilled asparagus. I used a pound of Coho Salmon and there was still enough salsa left over to put over a spinach salad the next day for a leftover lunch. Very light, very healthy. If you want a little more kick try adding some lime.

This was easy to make & tasted great. Nice & light in flavor. Great for a summer dinner.

Very good. Loved the room temp salsa on the side. A cold one on top of hot salmon cools the salmon. Guess it's a taste thing. Many foods taste better at room temp.

I personally could have used a little more kick but this is delicious. Very successful with my non-salmon eaters too. I used wild salmon to steer clear of PCBs.

I served the salmon on a bed of arugula salad and spooned the salsa over it, it was delicious. I added a little more olive oil to the salsa as I felt it was too acidic. Also reduced the amount of capers as I thought it would be too overwhelming. Can see using this salsa with grilled chicken breast too.

Read all the reviews, but Hubby and I were disappointed. Perhaps its because I wasn't keen on the room temp salsa on the salmon. Didn't have enough taste for us. I can't eat cilantro as it tastes like soap to me, so used Italian parsley - supposedly missing an ensyme (sp?). We ate the salsa on the side as a salad. Just joined as a member, but have made several recipes on the site, many of which I have thoroughly enjoyed. Eau de Vie

Use wild salmon if available, it is superior over farm raised. Add spice to the salmon before grillig (black & red pepper, sea salt). The jalpeno addition to the salsa is highly recommended.

The salmon was excellent! My guests and kids(!) loved it. However, next time I make the salsa, I will add a bit of spice - maybe some chopped jalapeno.

As always I made a few changes. Mostly to accomodate what I had in my house. I didn't have cilantro so I added a little fresh mint, and I had just picked up fresh heirloom tomatoes at the green market so I used those instead of cherry tomatoes. Also I was in the mood for a bit of a sweet taste and added about a cup of a asian melon which is like a VERY mild tasting watermelon, any melon or mango, papaya etc. would probably work though. I was very happy with the way this came out! Oh as someone else mentioned, I also halved the amount of oil (I almost always do) and didn't miss it a bit! Also since I'm in NYC and don't have a grill I cooked the fish in parchment paper in the oven, I'm sure on the grill it would be even better!

I made this last night to rave reviews. Delicious and oh so easy. What a great combination! I had a fair crowd and so cooked a whole fish (separated into two pieces) I wasn't able to find a fish basket and cooked it under the broiler to no apparent ill effect. I will try to find one for the next time though (which will be soon)

This was great and easy, and filled the bill for fresh and easy ad healthy, which we were looking for after all the christmas fatty foods. Everyone at dinner loved it-and the leftover relish was good with beans and cheese in quesadillas the next day.

Me and my two sisters have been making this recipe for quite a while now. We really love it with new baby potatoes. We have tried it with different green herbs as cilantro is not always available. We recommend to try the salsa with fresh esdragon. It gives the salsa a really delicate and exciting taste. This is one of our favorite recipies

Even my husband likes this recipe, so I fix it maybe once a month. I bake the fish in the oven with some of the salsa on top, and some fresh tomatos cubed. The salsa is wonderfull so I usually about double the recipee and serve it on noodles with extra tomatoes and some diced olives. The asparagus suggestion is one that I will have to try! P.S. you can try it with fresh basil or parsley for a different flavor

The salsa was good (I added one extra tablespoon of cilantro). However, the marinade was quite dull; neither my husband nor I could even tell the fish had been marinated in anything. Next time I'll just make the salsa and find a different way to prepare the fish.

My main reason for trying this recipe was the positive reports from others - and I wasn't disappointed! The salsa is great just on it's own - light and refreshing, and a perfect complement to the rich salmon. I served it with quinoa instead of the couscous suggested, and it was yummy. I just finished having some leftover quinoa and salsa as a salad for lunch. I'll definitely make this again.

I agree! This is a wonderful recipe. Very colorful and very, very flavorful. The nice thing is, if you have any leftover salsa it can be used on so many things. My friend Cheryl even used it on veggie tacos the next day!

I generally do not rate recipes unless I think that they are exceptional. In this case, the salsa is really an amazing compliment to an ordinary grilled salmon. I have tried several salmon recipes from this site and none compares to this one, yet (of course, everything is subjective). I served steamed asparagus with butter and couscous and it was outstanding! Will definately make this again (and pass it on to my friend Stephanie).

Great recipe! The salsa is delicious all by itself. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said this was one of his favorites. I make it once a month with salmon, swordfish, catfish or tilapia. It's a treat!

Delicious and healthy! I made this for a small dinner party and everyone LOVED it. The salsa was so fresh tasting, I will never use the stuff from the jar again. This recipe is so easy and the results are really good. I omitted the capers because I realized I was out while in the middle of cooking but will try them next time. I cooked the salmon on the George Foreman grill for 8 minutes with excellent results.

I needed a topping for grilled snapper and this one sounded tasty. I added a clove of minced garlic and a bit of diced jalapeno for a little kick. Worked nicely! I also used roma tomatoes since that is what I had in the garden. I think I might cut the amount of olive oil next time, but the basic idea was delicious. Thanks again, reviewers. It is always based on your opinions that I give an Epicurious recipe a try.

Absolutely fantastic---my guests (and even my kids) loved it. I cut "grape tomatoes" in half and then chopped peppers and cucumbers so they were the same size or slightly larger. We all felt that keeping the salsa a little chunky and crispier was great. I served with couscous and some sliced cantelope. Mixture of sweet/salty/garden was great. I am a salmon lover, and this is one of the best recipes I have ever had.

I love salmon and have made this entree many times. I believe I have improved on this wonderful recipe by grilling the salmon fillet on a cedar plank. The inspiration came from "Weber's Art of the Grill" (Cedar-planked Salmon). I soaked a one inch thick, 15" by 8" plank of cedar in water for over one hour prior to grilling and cooked the fillet on the cedar plank for 35 minutes (internal temp of 125 degrees) on a gas grill indirectly at high heat. It was outstanding. This is the best salmon I have ever eaten.

This dish is perfect for dining al fresco on a warm night. It was so easy to make and most of the dish could easily be made the day ahead with only the actual grilling done on the day of. I plan to serve this often to guests. After reading the reviews, I found a great recipe for a lemon couscous salad with spinach, scallions and dill to serve along with it. It was a great meal.

Just made this for the second time and loved it even more. The key is the salsa, which is actually more of a salad. I did chop in a jalapeno for a litle more kick, and it was outstanding. Feel free to cut the oil a little if you're looking to cut calories, but it's still a very healthful dish. I served it with lemon couscous and a fantastic white Bordeax on the patio for an unforgettable Sunday night dinner.

Very nice presentation. My husband and I both thought this was a beautiful and very tasty summer dish. I did find however, the salsa a bit watery. Next time I will salt and drain the cucumbers prior to preparing. I am looking forward to making it again with fresh cucumbers and home grown tomatoes. I served this with wild rice and roasted pine nuts simmered in coconut milk and grilled asparagus. I was sorry we did not have guests. This is a beautiful dish and would be a great 'company' meal.

We loved this dish! It is as good as the salmon dishes in upscale restaurants. I didn't want to use all the olive oil, so I reduced that to 1/8 cup. Used fresh tomatoes and red pepper. I grilled the salmon on my George Forman grill. This was so good that I can't imagine it getting much better by using all of the oil called for. Since I made this for just my husband and myself, we had leftovers. The next day I quickly heated the remaining salsa and flaked salmon with a bit of fat-free half and half and served over pasta. Topped this with just a bit of feta cheese. We couldn't decide which way was best.

Do yourself a favour and make this dish for your significant other on a Friday night. Then, invite them back for an amazing Sunday brunch omelette using the leftovers. Even cutting the recipe back for just the two of us, there was enough salsa leftover. I fried up (warmed) pieces of the grilled salmon with some roasted red pepper and a little of the salsa in a small fry pan with a little butter, then added an eggs and milk mixture (beat til a little frothy). After the egg mixture is mostly set, add a little more of the salsa along with some cheese (I used gouda), then fold over in half just like a regular omelette to finish cooking. Then top with a little more cheese, and you have anything but a regular omelette! Absolutely amazing and certainly the best omelette I've ever tasted. And yes, the meal with the grilled salmon was very enjoyable, too! I used tin foil for grilling without any troubles.

This was great! I used green bell peppers instead of yellow in the salsa and it was great. I liked the flavoring of the salsa, too much kick and it would mask the mild, creamy flavor of the salmon. I also went for salmon filets (tail portion) that way my guests didn't have to deal with bones!

Rating: 3
Great recip (four forks reserved for earth-shattering.) Substituted beets for the peppers as I had them in the fridge. Worked fine. Agree with Cinci, flavored couscous is a perfect side to a wonderful summer dinner. Also agree with previous reviewer that salsa could use a little kick. Touch of vinegar? Or jalapeno as suggested? I added a few cilantro leaves, helped alot. Finally, don't sweat the baking sheet. Cut salmon into 4-6 portions, place on oiled grill, DON"T OVERCOOK (3 1/2 minutes per side on medium gas weber), and you'll have no problem turning.

The salmon was quite good. The salsa should be made with very good summer tomatoes - without those, it wasn't that tasty, and not worth making again.

This was great for a small dinner party on the deck. The technique using the cookie sheet was terrific, but I nearly got burned when the coals flared as I turned the fish, so I highly recommend wearing a flameproof mitt. The leftover salsa (made with Italian parsley instead of cilantro)tasted even better the next day, so next time I will make it ahead to be able to spend more time with my guests. I also served couscous with dried apricots, currants and pistachios, and the cumin tied the dishes together nicely.

Pretty good, but not earth-shattering. The salsa was OK but could use a bit more zing (personally, if it doesn't have some kind of hot pepper in it, it isn't really "salsa"). Perhaps I'll throw in a jalapeno next time.
