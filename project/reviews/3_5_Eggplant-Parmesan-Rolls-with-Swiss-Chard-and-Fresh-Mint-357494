This was wonderful! I must admit I tried it only bc I needed to hide some swiss chard we got in our weekly vegetable box. It's a keeper with the following adaptions - roast eggplant per previous reviews direction, only a few min per side,; make it into a lasagna instead of rolls; the mint in fine, but not absolutely necessary. For nutrition purposes I used canola spray instead of oil, low fat ricotta and 1/3 the amount of Parmesan, 2/3 the amount of mozzarella. With all those reductions it still tasted plenty rich! Frozen thawed chopped spinach is another time saver and would work fine I think. It was yummy!

Delicious! I took the advice of another reviewer and roasted the eggplant slices, rather than broiling, and they were tender and easy to roll. I highly recommend including the mint. It brightens the filling and adds a delicious layer of flavor. I used quality store-bought Marinara sauce for a bit more flavor. My husband is the official cook in the family, but I made this for dinner and he was impressed. We even had better-the-next-day leftovers!

It was a blustery wet day and I was craving comfort food. What a wonderful adaptation of traditional eggplant parmesan. I was hesitant about adding the mint, but trusted the other reviews. Definitely include it, as it adds a bright layer of flavor to the cheese filling. Rather than broiling, I roasted the eggplant slices in the oven for 25 minutes at 425; lightly brushed with olive oil, then salt and pepper. Really brings out the flavor. I also opted for a store bought sauce(Rao's Homemade Marinara).

I was surprised how tasty the rolls were. The recipe was just what I was looking for. I couldn't find any Swiss chard that day, so used spinach and it was STILL excellent. My only suggestion is that I think you need a bit more tomato sauce.

I opted to make this into a lasagna, since I didn't have enough eggplant to make rolls. I made up the amount of eggplant with a red pepper and zucchini, and broiled them in the same manner. I also used a full 500 g tub of ricotta plus 2 tbsp chèvre, and added some fresh parsley to the mint. I put half the sauce on the bottom of the pan, a layer of whole wheat oven-ready noodles, the ricotta-chard mixture, more noodles, the veggies, more noodles, the rest of the sauce and then cheese on top. I didn't find the plain tomato sauce too bland, in fact I think the flavour of the mint may have been lost if too much was added. Next time I will definitely have to try the eggplant rolls!

Not that this dish needs another rave review, but I can't help myself. I've made it 3 times in the past month for various group dinners and it's been a hit every time. I make it exactly as it is with no variation.

Loved this. The mint was a pleasant surprise and added a lovely twist. I used part skim ricotta as well. It was not the least bit watery. I salted the eggplant for an hour, which may have helped . I also squeezed the heck out of the chard so that there was not a drop of water to be had there. The family loved this one and it will make it into out winter rotation.

This is my first review here. Just had this for dinner tonight with fresh swiss chard from our garden. It was wonderful. Rich tasting yet not heavy at all. I did use part skim ricotta but drained it in a strainer lined with paper towel for 30 min. and had no problem with extra liquid. Other than that I only made a few minor alterations to the recipe; a few extra herbs(although the mint stood out and is a must) and a bit of garlic and nutmeg to the filling as well as jarred marinara. I only wish it was not so labor intensive as I would make it more often.

My husband LOVED this dish. He said it's definitely one to serve to guests. I used the thinner Japanese eggplants, as well as zucchini slices. I also added some fresh tomatoes, fresh oregano, rosemary and basil, and garlic with a dash of sugar, salt and pepper to the tomato sauce. I let that simmer for about 30 mins.

This recipe is oddly fantastic. I agree with other reviewers that the mint absolutely makes the dish. And I also appreciated the advice to use whole milk ricotta to avoid extra liquid. The only change I made was to coat the eggplant on both sides with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake on 425 for 30 minutes. I did not salt them and let them sit. They were soft and easy to roll after cooling off. This is a keeper.

My husband made this for me for my 50th birthday and it was perfect and the hit of the party. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!!

So insanely good! This is time consuming, but worth it. Make 2 pans so you can freeze the leftovers. I used Muir Glen sauce and it was great. Also, please note that if you use part-skim ricotta, obviously you are going to end up with a more watery result.

I was amazed how wonderful this dish tasted. I will make this over and over!

Even though I was doubtful about the mint, I made the recipe as is (except with part-skim ricotta), and really enjoyed the light touch mint gave the dish. It was more watery than the picture, but scooped excess water out. Also, the filling made much more than used. Make sure to get good fresh eggplant as it really shines in this dish. Served with an arugula side salad, which was a nice side punch of flavor.

Absolutely delicious! I only baked it for about 20 minutes at 400 though (instead of 30+ at 350), and it was perfect! I just love broiled eggplant like that. So much better than fried! You can check out other recipes that I have tested at www.aveggietwist.com/blog

Just made this last night - it was delicious! I made the recipe exactly as is (well almost) - I used light ricotta cheese and touch more mint. It was great. It did require a touch more salt at the end b/c I find fresh mozzarella can be quite bland w/o salt. The other thing I found was that mine did not turn out quite as dry as the picture, I had a little bit more liquid then expected but I managed to spoon some out midst baking. Great staple recipe (but I do have to say; even for an avid cheese enthusiast like myself, I did do a double take with regards to the amount of cheese this recipe calls for!!!)

I cannot understand the low ratings. This is a delicious rendition of a common dish. It has a wonderful savory character while the ricotta really enhances the filling.

Delicious! I loved the photo on the front cover and just had to make it. I followed the recipe exactly, but substituted 'part-skim' ricotta for 'whole milk' kind. I used one can of Muir Glen organic tomato sauce and as it was perfectly seasoned, I'll use that again as a real time-saver. I cooked up organic Red Chard but agree that a good quality frozen organic spinach would also do the trick. The hint of mint is so different, but in a good way! I plan on serving this as a side dish for an Easter dinner party we are holding.

This was not at all worth the trouble. I made it exactly how the recipe was written, which I tend to do the first time I make anything off of a recipe. The filling was okay, but the mint was a little overpowering. The sauce was bland. I will stick with The Original.

Subbed cottage cheese for ricotta, used bottled sauce, forgot about the mint and cut eggplant crosswise-the roll-ups were more of a fold over. will make again--and again.

looking at the ingredients at a glance, there are neither Swiss cheese or cream in the recipe!!

This recipe produced a great light version of Eggplant Parmesan. I didn't have a whole pound of Swiss chard, because it came straight out of my garden. So I added more mint and some fresh parsley. I also added some diced canned tomatoes and oops I forgot the fresh mozzarella and used provolone instead. It was still wonderful and my family loved it.

I loved this dish and made it for guests who promptly asked for the recipe. The mint was great, but I'm open to trying the fresh basil as another reviewer suggested just for a change. Frozen chopped spinach worked very well and much easier than the swiss chard. Definitely use a nice marinara or your favorite red sauce with this recipe. For the work involved in preparing the eggplant, it would be shame to top it with plain canned tomato sauce. Yummy dish as an entree or side - I'll definitely make this again!

This is a very good recipe but the chard is overkill. Didn't add much to the success of the dish. Spinach could easily be used instead. Also, the recipe for the filling could have been cut in half. It makes way too much for the number of eggplant rolls. I was surprised the dish had so much taste using only tomato sauce, but it was very light and tasty. I put part of it in the freezer and I think it will taste just as good when defrosted.

This recipe is much better than I expected. I made it exactly as written and my husband and I both thought it was better than the sum of its parts. It was light yet filling and the mint, which I almost left out, really added a subtle but fresh taste to the dish. I'll make this one again.

I spent extra time on the sauce--more spices and simmering time--and saved time by trading the chard for frozen chopped spinach. The eggplant in this recipe is delicious. Even with the spicier sauce and so much cheese, the eggplant flavor shown through.

I thought this recipe was ok. It is a lot of work and I don't think that it is completely worth it. I used basil instead of mint and a store bought marinara sauce. I couldn't even taste the Swiss chard through all the cheese which is pretty disappointing. I probably won't make it again.

Delicious! I substituted spinach for the Swiss chard and fresh oregano for the mint. I will definately be making this recipe again.

I made the recipe as printed (using regular mozzarella) and we loved it even though it is a bit labor intensive. I'll try adding basil and using a marinara sauce next time--I'm sure it will be even better.

I substituted basil, oregano & garlic tomato sauce for the plain tomato as others have suggested and it came out delicious. Sits light in your stomach but fills you up. Leftovers are great for lunch too.

I combined this recipe with Nigella Lawson's soft and sharp involtini. Made Nigella's tomato sauce, grilled slices of eggplant in a panini grill and stuffed with boiled chard mixed with about 5 oz. of sharp feta, along with a bit of minced garlic and onion (reserved from the tomato sauce), salt, pepper and dried oregeno. I only used about half the tomato sauce for two eggplants and skipped the parm/mozzerella to keep things a little lighter. Waited til it was room temp to eat. Just delicious!

My husband and I made this as soon as we saw it on the cover of Bon Appetit! We made a couple of changes - we substituted basil for the mint and used a homemade marinara instead of the canned sauce. Aside from that, it was delicious and easy to make. It also tastes great the next day as leftovers!

Made this again for a potluck dinner and it was very well received. I did add a little more mint, and it seemed to me the flavor was a little strong. Next time I will back off on the mint and probably go with the addition of basil at the suggestion of the Cook from Ellensburg. Also used a good quality jar pasta sauce which greatly improved the dish. Found some buffalo mozzerella at Trader Joe's and it was worth the extra $$ for sure!

My husband who shuns eggplant admitted this was good. The chard in the grocery store was so pathetic I subbed a 1 lb bag of frozen chopped spinach. Time saver to boot. No mint at the store so I gave it a few shavings of nutmeg. I loved this but agree the sauce could be improved.

Rating: 3
Would give this 3!/2 forks if I could. My husband, who did not have to do the work of making it, gives this recipe 4 forks! I made a couple of minor changes based on earlier reviews and used a more flavorful sauce (Trader Joe's Arrabiata sauce) and also added 2 tablespoons of fresh basil to the filling along with the fresh mint. The dish tasted light yet had a satisfying amount of cheese and was very flavorful -definitely qualifies as comfort food. Does require a bit of time and effort, but worth it especially as a weekend night dinner.

I love eggplant and have other stuffed eggplant recipes but this one lacks flavor and is certainly not a cover recipe. The plain sauce lacks herbs which are such a compliment to eggplant.

Rating: 3
These little eggplant morsels stuffed with cheese are really delicious. I made a couple of changes just to save time. Instead of parboiling the chard, I wilted it in a pan with the rinse water still clinging to the leaves. Also I omitted salting and rinsing the eggplant slices. I might add a little more mint next time and also use a good "mother sauce" instead of plain tomato sauce. All in all, this was a really good addition to a vegetarian menu to which I added Italian Stuffed Mushrooms (from this site).
