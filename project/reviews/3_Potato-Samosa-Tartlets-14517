I used mini-muffin tins rolling bottoms 2 1/2 inches and tops 2 inches. Followed reviewer"s instruction re cooking and dicing potatoes. Pastry excellent, filling flavourful without being overly spiced, and chutney inside made perfect finger food without dripping sauces. Great for party or buffet. Will definitely make again.

I made this into a tart rather than little tartlets and served it drizzled with tamarind and coriander chutney. I took liberties with the spices and just added them free style. This was a great idea!

I would definitely NOT deep-fry these. I baked mine in the oven for about 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees instead, and they tasted great. I would agree with the idea of leaving the skins on to cook the potatoes, too, since they start flaking apart in the pot.

To answer the cook below...I make samosas on occasion and this is how I would add the potatoes. First, boil the potatoes whole with the skins on until they are done, yet still firm and willing to hold their shape. Let them cool a bit and then peel and dice them. After you have sauteed the spice and onion add the potatoes to the pan and lightly brown them. That way the potatoes can benefit from the strong onion and spice flavors and get a chance to brown and carmelize. Then add whatever else the recipe calls for. Make sure the filling is cool before assembling the samosas.

I was interested in making this recipe but couldn't figure out how to combine the potatoes, etc., into the filling mixture. Maybe a sentence was omitted
