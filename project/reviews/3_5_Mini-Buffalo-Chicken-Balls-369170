Great for a summer pool party, but wear plastic gloves when mixing the ingredients. Even with summer's humidity my knuckles were on FIRE. Surgical gloves fixed that.

I read the reviews, and I tried several things to avoid the meatballs being too soft. Meaning, I rolled the meatballs so they'd be smaller, I extended the bake time, and I broiled them for about 1 minute; having said this, I did not alter the ingredients nor the amount of each. Still, the meatballs were too soft and not as firm as I would have liked. The flavor was good, yet not great. I welcome others to weigh in on what I've written so I can improve the next batch. I'll definitely add more Frank's Hot Sauce the next time to improve flavor.

Great flavor, but as others have said a little mushy, even with reduced breadcrumbs. 6-7 minutes under the broiler (after baking) on each side helps too. Not sure if I will make again.

SO yummy!!!! Next time will broil 7 minutes each side to really get nice and browned.

Love this recipe! I make it with ground turkey - and it's great. No messy fingers (like wings)...all the joy and no bone!

The concept is good. However they need WAY less breadcrumbs in my opinion. Way too mushy for me. Next time I will try 1/4 cup breadcrumb and no butter at all.

Absolutely terrific! Followed the directions. I did cook them on stoneware for longer than required so they browned nicely. They were a huge hit!

These were a hit! So flavorful and satisfying! i used about 75% dark meat which I highly recommend. I omitted about 1-2 TBS of the butter, (didn't really need it if you use dark meat). I also added to the bread crumbs,a few dried herbs and 'Goya" chicken seasoning instead of the salt. These meatballs are so good that its definitely worthy of making homemade blue cheese sauce.

OMG, is this good! I made a lower-carb version by using only 1/3 cup of bread crumbs per pound of chicken, and they were still outrageous! I used Crystal hot sauce and also left out the salt. It seemed they would be too wet, but they cooked up succulent and perfect. We used Marie's chunky blue cheese dressing.

I didn't add the sauce to the meat, I rolled the meatballs and baked them on a cookie sheet, so that they would get that crispy, and then I added the cooked meatballs to the sauce, just like you would for Buffalo Chicken Wings, provide tooth picks. It was a hit.

I made the recipe exactly as directed.The flavor was accurately Buffalo wing-ish, but the texture was soft, mealy. Leftovers languished in the fridge. Not a substitute for the real thing.

These were a huge hit for the Super Bowl. As with others I would add more sauce next time (and there will be a next time). Also a few minutes under the broiler gave them a needed "crustiness".

Absolutely incredible! Easy to make, and the results are delicious. Made it twice in one week!

I made these the other night and my husband gobbled them up. They truly taste like chicken wings, but a much healthier version. I didn't give it 4 forks because I followed other reviewers advice and had to baste them with more hot sauce after cooking to give them the flavour one would expect of a chicken wing. I also feel that the butter is totally not needed and next time would just add the hot sauce in. I also minced 1/4 of an onion and added that in, which I feel helped with the flavours. If you do that, I recommend about 1/4 - 1/3 cup extra breadcrumbs to soak up the added juices. A must try and I will definitely make them again!

Great buffalo flavour, very easy to prepare and serve. A keeper! I used ground turkey thighs as I couldnt find ground chicken, and it worked just as well. The only trouble I had was that the meatballs didnt stick together too well, and were difficult to dip into the blue cheese sauce. This improved after a day in the fridge. In the future, I would make the meatballs in advance and reheat them on the day, and serve with extra buffalo sauce and blue cheese sauce on the side. Will also add in extra celery.

Sooo good dipped in blue cheese dressing! I doubled the amount of celery and hot sauce. Definitely will make again!

My friend and I both made this recipe last night in preparation for the "big game". I screwed up the recipe intending to make a triple batch, but only made 1.5 x chicken (thought it called for a pound). Anyway, the flavor is good, very buffalo, mine were a little spicy because I had extra sauce, but the consistancy is kind of bready...my friend's who followed the recipe exactly were kind of the same way. So, If I make them again, I may try to add more chicken and less bread crumbs and hope that they will still stick together. Wish they had a maybe for make it again. If I get rave reviews at the party will let you know...

Very good, would put under broiler for last 5 minutes to crisp up. Would also increase celery to 3/4 cup and mix in some diced scallions for flavor. I added 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning..and next time will decrease salt by 1/4 tsp. Topped with more hot sauce/butter mixture and sprinkled with chopped cilantro to serve.

I thought these were pretty good. For dipping sauce I use store bought blue cheese but added a little bit of hot wing sauce (Franks) and then put crumbled blue cheese on the top of sauce. served with a small spoon so each person could add their own sauce. All were gone at end of evening.

I could only find ground chicken breast (not thighs), but they still came out moist and yummy (though they are a little drier when reheating them). I used about 1/2 cup of Frank's, and the heat was just right for me. Next time, I think I'll use about 1/4 cup in the meatballs and toss them in additional sauce/butter right before serving to make them more saucy. (There was something a little lacking in the experience of these without sauce on the outside even though the flavor was spot on.)

Pretty tasty! I think anyone who likes hot wings will like these. I made extra hot sauce & butter for people to dip the meatballs into.

I thought these were great. Like one of the other reviewers I will omit the salt next time.

Yum, I made these a week before the Super Bowl to test the recipe. Even though I used the chicken breast I had on hand, they were very moist. I will definitely be making them for the Super Bowl, but a little bit hotter. Simple and delicious.

I made these meatballs for a party where we were requested to bring one-bite pick-ups. They were good but the next time, I will up the heat level substantially. I placed each meatball on a 1.5" toast round, topped with a blue-cheese/ranch-style spread and then the meatball. I also dusted the meatballs with cayenne pepper to give them more heat.

I made these for the first time tonight as I wanted to be sure I'd make them for a Super Bowl party. Pleasantly surprised at how moist the meatballs were. I upped the hot sauce (didn't measure, but used way more than 1/3 cup). I also tossed the meatballs after cooking with add'l wing sauce. To serve, I piled them on a plate and dotted them with really nice bleu cheese while they were hot. The bleu cheese melted slightly and provided a nice one-bite rather than using a bleu cheese dip. Insert toothpicks or have them on the side for grab n' go on any appetizer table.

I made these little meatballs for my wing loving boys and husband. We all liked them very much, but next time I will make them a tad hotter.

I am revising my previous review. After tasting them again today, they really were quite good. Maybe the overnight rest in the fridge improved the flavor. Anyway, I found myself going to the fridge over and over for just one more. Husband loved them.

Bland, bland, bland. Only saving grace was the blue cheese dipping sauce. If this is their best seller, I hate to fathom their other produts.

Made these last week for the Patriots Divisional Play-Off game and my house full of guests loved them! Easy to make and delicious. Didnt make the bleu cheese from scratch but the store-bought was just as good. Next time Im going to go a little heavier on the Franks.

Made these as written absent the salt. They were delicious! A big hit with teenage boys! Served them in sub rolls with blue cheese dressing, lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Will be making again soon.

I made these with my 13 year old son at his request. They were a big hit! I found that I didn't really need a 9x13 pan. An 8x8 would have worked just as well. Also, I drained the fat out of the pan when they were finished cooking. We used purchased blue cheese dressing to save time so we didn't actually try the dressing.
