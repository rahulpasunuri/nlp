Loved this as a chicken marinade, too. Served it with brown rice and Ginger Coleslaw for a light refreshing dinner.

Made this on vacation and it was a big hit with all eight of us. In fact I think it was the best ever for chicken! I didn't use the chiles only because I prefer food much less spicy. I used the brown sugar rather than the palm sugar.

I used this with the suggested pork loin for a party, and I was sure I'd gotten enough pork to have leftovers. NOPE. It was so good we just ate and ate until it was gone. Yum!

Yowza!! This is great! I used this marinade on shrimp, and it was to die for. Poured the extra reduced marinade over the noodle salad that I made as a side dish. So good!
