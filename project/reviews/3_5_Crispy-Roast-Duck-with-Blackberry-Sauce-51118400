I only used about 1 tbsp butter and about 1 tbsp sugar and the sauce came out great, nice and tart, I loved it!!

This recipe did not go well. I cooked duck per instructions, but came out of the over and was still undercooked and juices were not clear of blood. Sauce tastes too much like butter and did not thicken. Would never make this again.

This is so awesome, something that you would get at a fancy restaurant. The sauce is amazing. Serve this for a elegant romantic dinner!
