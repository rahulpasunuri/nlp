This recipe was great! I did use the sour cream instead of buttermilk, as per the reviews and it worked out really well, though did give a bit of a thicker batter. I used extra espresso powder, probably 2 tbsp. raw sugar, light olive oil, and tossed in some ground flax for some hidden health benefits. Pinning this one for sure.

I subbed yogurt for the buttermilk, and that seemed to help with the dryness issue that other reviewers mentioned. I also used 4 T of instant coffee instead of 1 T of espresso powder. They were great -- rich and chocolaty.

These were good. I used butter instead of vegetable oil and baked in mini muffin cups.

I made these yesterday and am very disappointed in them. Absolutely no coffee taste and very dry. They tasted like a "so-so" chocolate muffin. I am usually very pleased with recipes from Bon Appetit, but not this one!

This were not as good as expected... to me they tasted like a cake mix. This is my second time making them with so so results. I agree with others that the coffee flavor needs to be stronger.

I made these gluten-free for a friend, and they were fabulous! Sweet, mocha-y, and delicious! My first try at gluten-free baking, using gluten-free flour I picked up at Whole Foods. I would never be able to tell that they are gluten-free. Absolutely fantastic recipe! You could also make them vegan by substituting the two eggs with three tablespoons soy yogurt. I've made this substitution numerous times, and although I did use eggs in this recipe, it would definitely work on this one. I also substituted soy milk, as I did not have buttermilk, and couldn't tell the difference. I would recommend these to anyone and everyone!

From others' reviews, I made these using 2 tbsp of espresso powder but next time, I would boost this to at least 3 tbsp since the coffee flavour was still much less than I would have liked. I think I'd also like to try using pieces of bittersweet chocolate for an even tarter choc. taste (these were very sweet!)

These turned out very nicely. I made a few adjustments to make them vegan for the fasting period right now - I substituted 1 large banana to relace the eggs and some rice milk with apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk. My oven also is quick, so I only baked them for 15 mins. The coffee taste is not very strong, so I may add more espresso powder next time. I added a bit of cinnamon as well. I will definitely make these again.

I wasn't terribly impressed with these. I brought a dozen to a baby shower and no one ate them, I think b/c guests might have thought they were unfrosted cupcakes. I thought they were rather dry and not the best chocolate/coffee taste, but that could have something to do with my ingredient choices.

Rating: 4
Rather easy and so delicious. I used two mini-muffin pans instead of a regular muffin pan. It easily made 24 mini muffins with some batter to spare that I baked along side in a few small ramekins. The mini muffins took about 17 minutes to bake.

Rating: 3
pretty good -- I used probably about 1/2 cup brewed coffee, although I could have made it stronger. The coffee flavor is not really there. I also skimped a bit on the chocolate chips, and it made the muffins less sweet. Overall pretty easy and they look beautiful.

I have been making this recipe for years, and it is truly the very best chocolate muffin around. I've tried others, and none can compete. My kids love it (without the nuts).

I did not have espresso powder, so I substituted Kahlua . I also added cappuccino chips instead of the chocolate chips and pecans. These were a big hit!

Rating: 3
Very yummy - I doubled the coffee (actually used instant coffee cause I didn't have espresso) and had to use cream instead of buttermilk - and held the pecans - still fabulous! It must taste amazing when espesso and buttermilk are used, but easily sustituted as well.

In the words of Rachael Ray "Yum-O"! I do agree with other reviewers that they are a bit dry and they need a bit more coffee. Over all great taste and not too sweet either!

Yum. I made these using half whole wheat flour and half unbleached white and they turned out well. Also doubled the recipe with no problem. Will be put into the muffin rotation when we feel like a treat!

I cannot say how many times I've made these! They're great everytime I feel I need a chocolate fix. I always add more coffee, like the other reviewers suggested.

Just a little disappointed in these muffins. On the dry side and barely could taste the mocha. I think the recipe comes from a Long Island bakery cook book (Tate's in Southhampton)

Rating: 4
I find myself craving these. I doubled the espresso flavor, and the muffins are still very chocolately - not fudgy like cake - but still too dense to be a breakfast muffin, however, they're awesome. If you make these as jumbo muffins, you get six beautifully risen bundles of tastiness for the same 25 minutes of baking time.

Rating: 3
A good muffin for chocolate lovers. I omitted the nuts, the mocha powder, added one tsp cinnamon, and added a dash of milk to the batter at the end. Take care in not overbaking - I cooked only 20 min and the results were excellent!

Mmmm...these were great! I made them yesterday and only one is left. My sister said they were among the best muffins she's tried. The only change I would make is adding a little more esspresso powder. They didn't taste very much like coffee, but that could have been because i have a cold....

REALLY good :) The recipe made 12 exactly, despite my misgivings about how little batter there seemed to be. I only wish they had been just a little moister and fluffier. I used finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans because of the price differential and because I had some already. Next time I plan to make minimuffins using minichips. Also think it might be good leaving out the nuts and using mint-flavoured chocolate chips, or peanut-butter chips (probably omit the espresso for that).

These muffins are perfect for all the chocolate lovers out there! I followed the recipe and they turned out great. Fantastic texture and taste - I dusted the muffins with powdered sugar before serving. Definitely a keeper!!!

These were fantastic! My Daughter who dosen't like chocolate too much, called me (I made them before I took a business trip) and said Mom these are the bomb! She wouldn't share them with here co-worker and was eating on them all that week. Very good recipe for the chocolate lover!

I made these muffins for my husbands birthday. He brought them to work, and they disappeared in a heart beat. I did leave out the pecans, but they still turned out great.

Rating: 3
This is a delicious recipe! I ended up using scant half cups each of brown (unpacked) and white sugar, which resulted in a not too sweet but very tasty muffin. I was afraid that the chocolate chips (a mix of ghiradelli double chocolate, semi-sweet, and white chocolate chips) would be too sweet with the amount of sugar called for in the recipe. I also included 1 teaspoon of cinnamon which added a nice depth to the overall flavor.

I made these "muffins" (which I would really call "cakes") for a brunch. To make a long story short, I had to mop up my friends from the floor after they all melted from eating such a decadent dessert. I left out the pecans and just went straight for the pure chocolate additives. Highly recommended. Highly!

Absolutely delicious! Texture was very good after 25 minutes, although mixture was quite wet. Taste strongly chocolate. Will definitely make this again!

I thought these muffins were great. They're very moist and chocolatey without being too sweet. Good for breakfast or for dessert.

These were great - had them as a dessert the day they were made and as a part of breakfast the rest of the week. I followed the recipe exactly and would have liked a bit more of a coffee flavor, so I think I'll experiment with that next time. Sweet, but not horribly so, and the nuts are a nice contrast. In short, delicious.

these are more of a dessert muffin- pretty rich for my taste for a breakfast one- but my family LOVES these!! one of their favorites- a definite member of my muffin reperatoire!!

Rating: 2
well, they're pretty good. i made them into mini loaves and attempted to elevate the coffee flavour by using just 1/8 water and adding a douse of kahlua. added a bit extra buttermilk incase there was a moisture problem and used semi-sweet mini choc. chips. the bread/loaf/muffin is still a bit dry, but the flavour is pretty good. I had all the ingredients on hand and tried it today, but probably won't make them quite like this again. also, i think 1 tsp salt is a litte much...

Rating: 3
Maybe they're not really muffins - yet they've become a favorite muffin recipe in our home. The flavor improves by replacing the espresso & hot water mixture with 1/4 cup Kahlua coffee liqueur. The problems with dryness can be corrected by adding a bit more Kahlua (or buttermilk), if the batter seems too firm when all the ingredients are combined. Also, be careful not to overbake - these muffins dry out quickly in the oven.

Rating: 2
Followed this recipe exactly. They did not have near the flavor I was expecting them to have. I guess I thought they'd be a little richer, maybe more moist and a lighter texture. If I'd needed a dozen doorstops I would've been in good shape. Don't think I'll visit this one again.

I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe. First, they're more like cupcakes than muffins. Second, despite adding additional expresso, the only flavor which came through was the chocolate. They were dense and moist. I guess they would make a good chocolate cupcake.

Good results. I'd definitely make them again, but next time I might add a little more espresso powder.

I thought these turned out really well. I couldn't find the expresso powder, so I substituted w/Mocha instant coffee. I gave them as gifts and everyone has said they were delicious. I have to admit, they weren't quite as flavorful as the reviews led me to think they might be. Overall, easy, quick and yummy.

I've added more mocca then requested. I served them at our housewarming party and they were gone immediately. I will definetly make them again.

Can't decide if these are especially sweet muffins or slightly bready cupcakes. One of my co-workers said it depends when you serve them. More of a coffee break confection to me, unless you like a sweet, rich muffin for breakfast.

Yum. These muffins stayed exceptionally moist. My family just loved them. I loved the hint of Mocha, it really added to the flavour of the chocolate. Definitely a winner in our household.

I keep getting requests from others to make this recipe again. It's a huge hit everytime. I often make them as mini muffins, so the size makes them very appealing even to those who don't want much.

These muffins were absolutely the best. Tender, moiste with a deep chocolate flavor accented by the chips and a hint of expresso. They were quick and easy to make. I used 12 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate chips, sprinkled them with turbinado sugar and baked them in 3/4 cup muffin tins which yielded six giant muffins. Definitely a hit with everyone who tasted them.

This is one terrific recipe, easily makes some muffins that will easily satisfy the worst chocolate craving, and oh that mocha!!! I used almonds instead of pecans, because that was what I had on hand and they were wonderful.

These are the best "muffins" I've ever had! They are moist and chocolately -- more a cupcake than a muffin. Easy and goof-proof, I've made this recipe many times without a failure. A sure crowd-pleasure!

They were good, especially when warmed in the microwave for a few seconds. They weren't quite as moist as I thought they would be, but I only used 1 cup chocolate chips & they were semi-sweet, so maybe that's why.

The best muffin recipe I have found yet. They are very moist. Similar in taste to Costco's Chocolate Chip Muffins. Next time I plan to try white chips for a more attractive appearance.
