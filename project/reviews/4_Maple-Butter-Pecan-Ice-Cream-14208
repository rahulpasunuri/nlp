Really great recipe...I added a touch more maple extract and topped it with buttered pecans instead of blending them in. Awesome maple flavor. Can't wait to try it again, this time with walnuts.

Really delish . We used some half and half and 2% milk in place of all the heavy cream. to top it off, we put bits of bacon on top when we served it.

Amazing!!! Followed the recipe almost exactly. I substituted the pecans with chopped up little pieces of maple sugar candy. To die for!!!!

This is so easy and so good, I make it in my cuisinart ice cream maker. My brother in law makes maple syrup from trees on property that we share, and he was thrilled that this was made with his syrup! I don't care for maple flavor much, but this is spectacular!

This is simply amazing. My wife immediately said you need to make this again.

This is one of the richest, most flavorful ice creams I've made. I used locally produced real maple syrup, maple extract, and added a touch of vanilla too to bring out the flavors. Incredible.

Great recipe and very creamy. The only change we made was to add a bit of vanilla extract (just because we like it).

Yummy! The custard was so good I am surprised I had any left to put in the ice cream maker. Didn't have maple extract so I used vanilla. Still came out great. Plenty of maple flavor. Served it with Panetone Egg Nog Bread Pudding (foodnetwork).

I don't like nuts in my ice cream but I LOVE maple so I omitted the pecans... was AMAZING! Best home madde ice cream flavour to date!

This was wonderful! Immediately after churning I would have been perfectly happy without the pecans as they didn't seem to add much. But, after sitting in the freezer for 2 days the flavors really bloomed. With or without the nuts, this makes a fabulous summer treat!

Absolutely the best ice cream! I made it for a dinner party and served it with apple tarts. It was so good that I made it the following week for Thanksgiving. Everybody raved! I will make one and half times the recipe the next time as this amount doesn't fill my ice cream maker.

Sinfully delicious! I got nervous when I brought the custard mixture together, because it was already at 170 degrees - I was expecting to bring it up to that tempurature slowly. Then I didn't see it freezing in the ice cream machine and thought it truly failed. I was very happy in the end- as it did finish freezing - and was creamy and wonderful!

This ice cream was amazing...so rich and creamy and flavorful. The maple extract really brings out the maple flavor so I wouldn't substitute vanilla if you want a good maple flavor. Will be making this again.

I will be making this again on a regular basis! The pecans were crunchy, the maple flavor outstanding. I did not have maple extract, I used vanilla but it was great, especially with hot fudge.
