I read some of the reviews and don't think most of them are necessary. The only thing I'd suggestnisnuse broth instead of water and add a bit more salt. I didn't have Sage, so I used Rosemary. I used whole wheat spaghetti since that's what I had in the house and it was very good. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe for when you want a healthy comfort food. I didn't understand why the recipe wanted the squash cubed, then chopped, so I hand chopped it and saved time and clean-up. I also only used 1 Tbsp of butter and didn't miss the rest.

This really did not taste very good except with a lot of parmesan and romano cheese. The sage really altered the flavor. I would not make this again.

This turned out great, with some revisions as suggested by others: Roast the squash instead of processing it, use broth instead of water, add some chili powder, and serve with caramelized onions. Without some tweaking it would be too bland. Definitely will make this again!

Great easy recipe for beginner like myself. I microwaved the squash to speed things up and avoid having to cut it while hard. Even tasted great the next day at work!

Based on other reviews, I turned this into a quick after work meal. I fried 3 strips of bacon, removed it and sauteed the coarsely chopped onions in the bacon fat. I cubed and added the squash after about 5 minutes, along with the sage, garlic, salt and pepper. I'm guessing I cooked the squash about 5 minutes before I put the pasta in to cook. Toward the end I added some pasta water and mashed the squash a bit with a spoon. I think I got good flavor without roasting the squash or separately caramelizing the onions. Oh, and at the last minute because I was low on parmesan I stirred in some soft goat cheese along with the crumbled bacon. It worked great.

I guess you could say I used this recipe as inspiration. I started with pre-cut squash which I roasted with olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper until almost done. While that was roasting, I fried 2 bacon strips, then caramelized a sliced onion in some of the bacon fat, which I set aside when done. I combined the roasted squash, garlic, dried sage and some fresh thyme (it's what I had on hand) and vegetable broth (replacing the H2O) in the same pan and cooked until the squash was tender, then added the butter. I combined the cooked squash, drained pasta, cheese, onions, 1 cup of pasta water, a touch of cream and some toasted walnuts together, then put it all into a baking dish. I topped the dish with coarse breadcrumbs and the bacon (crumbled), dotted it with some butter and baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. It was super yum...a nice combination of tastes and textures. Hearty but not heavy. I am already thinking about the leftovers for dinner tomorrow!

I've made this a few times (usually with penne), and we love it. Use a really sharp knife or buy the pre-cut butternut squash (not only in Trader Joe's now, but in most produce sections). I've also started roasting the squash a bit first, which is really nice. I'm a big fan of the caramelized onion combination, and I've also done this with some toasted walnuts on top. Delicious.

Fabulous dish! Definitely roast the squash instead of puree-ing it raw. Roasting brings out the flavor and saves you having to wash the food processor/blender. We used shallots instead of onions as we needed to use them up. I think maybe onions would have imparted a better flavor, but this was still delish. Highly recommended!

I added caramelized onions as one reviewer suggested but didn't enjoy this combination of flavors.

I really enjoyed this dish, but it is a little bland. It's definitely something I'd make again though--great summertime meal!

I love this dish ... I used a lot of the suggestions other reivewers had, plus some of my own. I roasted the squash and skipped the blender. I just chopped it into small cubes. It got pretty soft when cooking it with the sage but stayed chunky enough for this squash fanatic. Also, I cooked three slices of bacon, kept half the drippings, added the butter and cooked the garlic. Add the squash, extra sage and then pasta water as needed. Chop the bacon and mix in with carmelized onions and toasted nuts before serving and it is AMAZING.

Made a few modifications, but this recipe is definitely a keeper for a squash lover like myself-- great mid-week fall comfort food. DH was running late so I left out the cup of pasta water, put it all into a casserole & baked it for half an hour. Resulted in a very mac&cheese-like dish. Followed the suggestion for toasted walnuts on top -- next time I'll add more sage & cook the squash in broth.

My very Italo-centric boyfriend adored this dish. He even claimed it was better than his own version! However, I did take just about all of the previous reviewers' suggestions, and used (roasted) vegetable broth instead of water, and I caramelized some onions and toasted some walnuts in butter and put them both on top as a garnish. The onions and the nuts really rounded out the flavor and added depth and richness. I was skeptical about the "mac and cheese" thing, but it's true, it is very remeniscent of M&C, and is definitely as satisfying. I now make sure I always have some butternut squash prepped and ready to go in the freezer!

amazing...went over well...making again tonight!

I liked this a lot, but it did need more sage..also like the idea of adding toasted walnuts or pine nuts next time. Wonder if instead of using chicken broth (veggie!) that maybe roasting the squash and frying the sage would intensify flavor?

This was a good, very interesting preparation of squash. I found it necessary to cook the squash much longer than the recipe suggests to get a pleasant texture. Tasty, fairly healthy, prepared with spelt pasta, but no way my stepkids would think this was macaroni and cheese! Could spice it up a bit with cayenne or red pepper. Will probably make this again.

We enjoyed this recipe at our house, even my 7 year old who doesn't normally like squash ate a pretty decent portion. I do think its important to cook the squash down well as it was a bit grainy. I also took a suggestion from the reviews and cooked it in broth for more flavor. Didn't have fresh sage so I used dried.

This is very good. I used chicken broth instead of water.

I followed the advice of others and used Chicken Broth instead of water. I thought the flavor was subtle but very nice. The sage looked a bit funny, but added nice flavor. I used probably 4 tsp of it. I'm going to make it again doubling the squash for a lower calorie, healthy meal.

No forks bccause I haven't tried this yet, but i would never boil the squash but bake it in the oven after cutting and peeling it . I would sprinkle it with a bit of olive oile which was saesoned lightly with ginger. I would then sprinkle the finished product with some finely chopped amaretti cookies and some very fine olie oil or a bit of butter

I used vegetable broth (made with a boullion cube) instead of water to cook the squash. I think this gave it more taste. Instead of adding reserved pasta cooking water at the end, I added about 1/3 cup of hot whole milk. The result was delicious.

I've made similar dishes, and suspected that the blandness came from using water to cook the squash instead of chicken stock, and I was right. Pasta and squash are a wonderful pairing, and this is a simple (as opposed to ravioli or lasagna) way to enjoy it. You can also kick up the sage a bit (I almost always go heavy on fresh herbs).

This is a great recipe for people who like boring pasta dishes. Does anyone ever taste these recipes before posting them? A waste of time, don't bother

Gourmet mac & cheese!! I gave it 3 forks because my kids actually thought it was mac & cheese and had no idea they were eating squash which is a plus!

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this dish was. Very easy & tasty for a weeknight dinner. I added some toasted, buttered walnuts to top it off.

This was a nice dish and easy to make but it had very mild flavor. I made it as a main course, but I think it would be better as a side dish.

Made this last week for dinner and it was incredible! Followed the recipe to a T. A very unexpected blend of flavors. I highly recommend this recipe for an interesting way to use butternut squash.

I added about a 1/4 pound of cubed pancetta, plus three or 4 thinly sliced shallots (cooked them together, then added at the end). Also, a little chicken broth or stock tossed with the pasta can add some flavor. Good weeknight standby.

I haven't made this yet, but am excited to try this as I love the butternut squash lasagne recipe (on this site), but lasagne is just so time consuming to make, so I am looking forward to this taste in an easier to prepare dish! Will review after I make. One thing I might note, is that one reviewer mentioned it was bland, the lasagne recipe calls for milk and garlic, so maybe instead of using all water to cook the squash, you might try adding a bit of milk which might improve the sauce? And adding some garlic. The lasagne also calls for rosemary instead of the sage this recipe calls for, I prefer the taste of rosemary. Just some thoughts.

I followed all the instructions to this recipe but found it really bland. The squash is too subtle a flavour for pasta and the cheese just seem to disappear and not have any punch. I even added a little extra Parmigiano-Reggiano. I wouldn't make this again.

I rated this high because it was so much better than I expected. I forgot to get fresh sage so I used less than a teaspoon of dried. I don't have a food processor either so I just cut the squash into smaller cubes and cooked it a little longer, until it was soft enough to mash it. The wonderful thing about this was that the squash acts like a creamy sauce for the parmesan cheese to melt in. I've never tried anything like this before. My kids just gobbled it up, they didn't even know they were eating squash! A real keeper.
