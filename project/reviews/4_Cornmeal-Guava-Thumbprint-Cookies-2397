These are my husband's favorite cookie and now that the Christmas batch is gone I am going to make some more. I always have guava jelly on hand but this time I will do half with guava and half with tart red cherry jam ( from Wolferman's) which is anoher favorite in our household.

These tasted a little funny when they were warm, so I let them cool completely before I tried it again, with a much better result. The spices add a depth that I think it needs, and it's got a nice crumbly sort of texture. I used triple berry preserves, since that's what I had. I would make these again.

These were really dry, you couldn't even roll them into balls with your hands, they would just crumble apart. Had to kind of 'push' them together in my cupped hand. I personally find it insulting that someone would say "They aren't dry if you measure the flour correctly", like I'm some kind of idiot and haven't made cookies dozens of times. I must just be measuring flour incorrectly all of these times, goodness me!

This is the driest batter I've ever tried to handle. After the first batch of cookies so cracked they looked like they had petals, I added an egg and maybe 1/8 cup milk. The cookies were then prettier, but the jam remained the nicest part of them. I like cornmeal cookies but these were unimpressive. So much butter to so little effect!

Very good, love the grainy texture. A lot of work for a small batch, next time might double the recipe. I thought the guava was plenty sweet, next time might try a jam less sweet with maybe more tartness. Am anxious to see how they fare at potluck for Xmas eve.

These are easy and good enough to include in a Christmas cookie collection. They aren't dry if you measure the flour correctly (use a spoon to lightly scoop flour out of the container and into the cup). I used double the cinnamon and no nutmeg with wild currant jelly.

These cookies are fabulous! I love the nutmeg. I used pineapple preserves because it's what I had, and they were delicious. Perfect for a light, sweet finish to a summer luncheon. But I can't wait to try to any different kinds of jam.

These are excellent - a good adult cookie. The depth of flavors is wonderful and not overly sweet. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used guava paste instead of the guava jelly.

I made these cookies with what I had on hand, using raspberry jam instead of the guava jelly. They have a nice balance of sweetness and spice. The double batch disappeared quickly!

I made these thinking I would bring a few to work. As soon as I tasted them I knew they would stay home. I used guava loaf instead of guava jelly.

this is a good basic recipe -if dry add the egg white- guava jelly is in the "goja"section - or add currants & pine nuts - yum !

this cookie spiced up my christmas cookie repetoire. i used the guava paste and added 1/2 teaspoon of cayene. you dont taste the pepper, but a nice heat develops at the end--awesome!

Try these using guava paste: It gives a more intense guava flavor.

Absolutely my favorite cookie recipe. I usually put in at least half of the reserved egg white, then make sure the dough is chilled before rolling so it's not too sticky. Smuckers makes guava jelly and I've had no problems finding it in the normal jelly aisle. Goes great with barbeque dinners.

I made these for a cookie exchange party last year. I was hoping for the most unusual cookie. Instead I won best all around!! These are pretty, have a nice buttery sandy texture, and the sweet guava is a nice counterpoint. I plan to make them again this year for family and friends.

This recipe is very easy to make and the cookies come out great. The cornmeal makes for a nice flavor and texture, a little different than your typical thumbprint cookie.

Tasty and fast...didn't have nutmeg so used 1/4 tsp allspice and a pinch more cinnamon. Made with cake flour and white cornmeal since that was all I had. Tried with apricot, strawberry, and Tiptree ginger. All good but the ginger was fantastic. Will definitely make again.

I found these to be absolutely fantastic! I had bought guava jam on my honeymoon in Hawaii and it has languished in the cupboard ever since. What a fantastic way to put it to good use. I did notice that the dough was quite dry and wasn't sticking together very well, so I went ahead and added the egg white to the dough. It made it a little sticky, but other than sticky fingers, I thought the cookies turned out great! I am planning on adding the full egg next time I make them as well.

These cookies were a cinch to make and were absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe easily and my colleagues snapped them up! I plan to include these in my holiday cookie packages!

These were a snap to make and a very nice change from the usual Christmas cookies in my gift boxes. The cornmeal gives a nice texture.

I thought these cookies were absolutely delicious and very unique--a nice change of pace from the typical oatmeal or chocolate chip cookies. These were the most popular cookie at my cookie exchange!

The cookies are crunchy and really easy to make. I found the nutmeg too overpowering for my taste, so next time I intend to use less. I could not find guave so I used apricot jam instead.

I made these cookies for a project on guavas for culinary school; the class seemed to like them, but I found them a bit dry. I used medium grind cornmeal-it gave it an intresting 'seed-like' crunch. Guava jelly is hard to find; my suggestion is an Asian market.

These are wonderful cookies...I've never been able to find guava..so I've used Polander apricot and Polander Black Cherry...both are great. One of my favorite cookie recipes...nice when you don't want a really filling dessert.
