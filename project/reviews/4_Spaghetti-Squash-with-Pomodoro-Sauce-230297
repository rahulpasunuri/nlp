Wow! This is the easiest, freshest spaghetti sauce I have ever made - and I have tried a lot. Follow all directions with some extra garlic and medium-large onion.

The sauce is simply the best I've ever tasted. Have utilized the sauce over angel hair pasta. Very good!

Simple and excellent. We picked a spaghetti squash from the garden and this was the perfect way to turn it into dinner. Threw in a few meatballs by request & perfect!

i tried it last time and it was first experience with spaghetti squash. It was absolutely amazing and very easy to make. It will definitely become my staple.

So yummy! I couldn't find many spaghetti squash main courses, but this one struck gold! We topped each serving with a poached egg and grated parmesan to get some more protein. It was really filling and tasty. I opted out of using vinegar and used white wine instead, turned out great.

I made this last night for my husband and I. It was the perfect meal for a cold January night. Not only is it delicious, but it's healthy for you! I added some cremini mushrooms and put a little olive oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper on the squash before I put it in the oven for a little more flavor. I love the sauce from this recipe! I'll definitely use it for other dishes.

My husband and I look forward to this meal when the weather gets colder. I make it as written and serve it with eggs (poached or over easy) on top. A sprinkling of parmesan and this is the healthiest comfort food you'll ever have!

This is a great springboard to a good healthy meal. You could add just about anything to this and it would be good. I added summer squash, zucchini and mushrooms. To echo others, good way to get filled up and avoid the carbs.

I made this (almost) as written and it was great! I added fresh baby spinach to the sauce when it was done cooking and let it wilt, just wanted to get some greens into my dinner. I would probably use a bigger squash next time though. I bought a 2lb squash (recipe says 1.5lb) and there was too much sauce for the amount of squash (in my opinion). I served it with turkey meatballs which made for a wonderful, light dinner! The sauce itself is yummy so I would use it again even for a different dish.

the red pepper adds a nice kick, but the nutritional value and low calories makes this dish extra worthwhile.

Very good. I used San Marzano canned whole tomatoes, added two anchovies and about 1 TBS of sugar to balance the sourness. A bit of salt and pepper rounded out the flavours. Delicious! Great alternative to a carbo-laden meal.

Made it exactly as specified. I added a little white wine and some grated cheese at the end. So goof!

I have never made spaghetti squash before, so was curious to see the results. At first I was a little bit thrown off by the texture (definitely more crunchy than al dente) but in the end wound up really enjoying it. I used the techique for this recipe but used my favourite bottled marina sauce and added some feta into the mix plus lot of fresh black pepper. Great idea to save carbs.

I love spaghetti squashes and I make this recipe alternating with another simple spag squash recipe.

This recipe is so delicious and so easy to make. To give it a bit more heft, I sometimes add ground turkey to the tomato sauce. I put it in after cooking the onions and garlic and before the tomatoes, etc.

Most spaghetti squash recipes call for a cream sauce, so I was skeptical that this would work. However, the spiciness of the sauce (I added a little extra red pepper) was really nice with the sweet squash. Great texture and flavor. As a main dish, I wanted a bit more substance though. Will probably serve with italian sausage or a chicken breast next time.

Super yummt. super easy. i liked it with chicken sausage slices mixed right in.

So easy. So delicious. So much flavor for so few ingredients. I've made spaghetti squash in the past to poor reviews (I think the pasta sauce was always too heavy). This was perfect and everyone ate it. Used 1 can of Rotel's mild (left out pepper flakes at the end) because I was out of regular diced, skipped the tomato paste to keep it lighter, and kept everything else the same.

It was my first time preparing spaghetti squash....So delicious...so healthy! The sauce was very good, but I have to say that spaghetti squash with garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil is also phenomenal as a side dish. I will make this again next week!

Delicious, I wouldnt make any changes to the recipe for the Marinara. Next time I will try using a larger spaghetti squash (maybe a 2 pounder?) because the sauce has a very strong flavor, and I would like to taste a little more squash. Basil and parmesan is a must. Makes great leftovers.

Very easy, tasty, and exceedingly low calorie. My squash was very big, so it took much longer to cook than the recipe indicated, so make sure to take the size of your squash into account when cooking.

This was really easy and fast to make; active time was under 15 minutes. I don't think the "alternative" noodles are required--you have to simmmer the sauce for 30 min; I just pulled the squash when the sauce was done. Perfect! Exceptionally flavorful and healthy!

Loved it!

My usual preperation for spaghetti squah is to cut lenghtways, remove seeds, and fill with stuffing and bake it. I have never served it this way. It was really good. I added some ricotta cheese on top and used fresh tomatoes rather than canned. I will use this recipe again, we always have an overstock of squash in the fall from the garden.

I really like the sauce for this recipe. The only change I made was to add a bit of water to thin the sauce a bit. It was delicious! This was my first time eating spaghetti squash and it had a surprising crunch, which was a bit unexpected, but the sauce made it all worth it.

Delicious alternative to spaghetti marinara. I used 8 heirloom tomatoes (peeled, seeded and diced) and used fresh herbs. Also added 1/2 cup Bordeaux and let simmer for 1 hour. This was the most beautiful sauce I have made so far.

Excellent! This was the first time I ever had spaghetti squash. I had one serving for dinner and now I have leftovers for lunches over the next 3 days! I think next time I will add some grated parmesan.

This was quick, easy and delicious. I was looking for a light sauce to accompany cheese ravioli and this was perfect.

I really enjoy this recipe. I've made it several times.

This was very easy and has a lot of veggies without sacrificing taste... Kids don't even know they aren't eating spaghetti. I used our fresh roma tomatoes from the garden and didn't use the tomatoe paste, only because I didn't have any on hand. I also added some chopped walnuts to give it a more meaty texture, since I am used to it in my traditional spaghetti sauce. I will definitely make this again
