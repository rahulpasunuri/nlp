Even my friends who don't like goat cheese liked this (and went back for seconds). I'll make this one again.

I have made this tart since the recipe came out in 1995. It is one of my favorite appetizers of all time. Do the onions the night before and you can bake the crust several hours before you are going to top it and put in oven. I reduce the onion by 1/2 and I feel you should cut the onion smaller to make it less awkward to eat.

This dish was incredible. A fantastic way to appreciate red onions-- and goat cheese! I used homemade pesto from the classic pesto recipe on this site. Then again, what couldn't be good--full- fat cheese, whipping cream, egg, pastry...hmmmmm....

This is terrible! Very heavy on the red onions - very ugly to look at and even worse tasting. Do not make this!

This is the best quiche/torte I've ever made. I used a combination of goat cheese and aged swiss on the bottom, used grilled onions and red pepper, then sprinkled finely chopped fresh rosemary and parmesean cheese on the top. fantastic.

This went pretty quickly, but I think it was due more to the visual appearance than the taste. It looks quite beautiful with the red onion wedges and chopped basil sprinkled on top. Strong goat cheese flavor, so next time I would reduce it. Because people seemed to prefer the pieces that had a crust to hold on to, next time I will halve the dough lengthwise and make two long tarts. If you are nibbling on this at a cocktail party, note that the onion wedges can be a little messy to eat as well. Also, making this tart was easy but a little time-consuming.

We prepared this dish as an appetizer for a dinner party we hosted. The only change we made was to combine the carmelized onion with the cheese mixture, instead of placing on top. Everyone loved it!!!

If goat cheese is your thing, then this is your recipe. Very impressive looking. Used it for a luncheon and everyone loved it.

Excellent and impressive. I am not fond of goat cheese so I mixed it 50/50 with cream cheese. Excellent reviews from family.

This was just super easy to do! Very tasty, and colourful. Next time I am going to add snippets of sun-dried tomatoes for added colour, and a touch of different flavour. Either which way-this one is a keeper!

Simple to prepare and absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe to take as an appetizer for 4 people - and the tart and I were immediately invited back!

Very good as an appetizer. If I was to make it again I would use less cheese and more of the onion. Great flavour!

Wonderful! My family likes the crusty edges so I halve the pastry dough lenghwise and make two separate tarts.

I made this for a party a couple of weeks ago and everyone flipped over it. I was invited back to the same house 2 weeks later and was asked to bring it again. It was a big hit. A little time consuming to make but well worth it.

Wonderful appetizer. I peel the onion, cut just the root part off, and hold the onion sections together with a toothpick when I cook them. I also use waxed paper under the crust when I put the egg on the edge to keep it from getting on the pan. I gave it 5 stars.
