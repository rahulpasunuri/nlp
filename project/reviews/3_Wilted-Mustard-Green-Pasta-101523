A variation on a true Italian classic. Try cooking the greens in the pasta water before cooking the pasta. This will take some of the bitterness out of the greens, and leave you vitamin-rich water in which to cook the pasta. Top the finished dish with some grated Pecorino Romano cheese.

Mustard greens are a sharp and bitter so you had better like them for this recipe. I put in butter to soften the greens. I should have added the butter right into the frying pan and not tried to melt it into the pasta in the bowl.

Very simple. I tried to make it more by adding oil and balsamic vinegar and a leek. I almost think it would have been better without it. Just accept that it is a very simple recipe.

This recipe is a nice building block. My sweetheart made this and, of course, I was looking over his shoulder and throwing in my 2 cents. Because it tasted bland, he added chopped pecans and red pepper flakes. I also added some chicken broth to moisten and add flavor. We served this with left-over Roast Chicken with Pan Gravy. I drizzled some of the gravy over the pasta and it added a lot more depth of flavor.

I loved this recipe. I added a few things of my own that were going to go bad if I didn't use them... a little bit of sage and a cube of pesto. Turned out great!

Loved it. Adding 1/2 c. of grated parmesan made it really sing too. Great for winter and summer!

I used campanelle shaped pasta, increased the garlic. I used frozen mustard greens. I thought it was very tasty. However, my husband thought the greens were bitter.

I found that it lacked any zip! We added 1 tbs of pesto, and this helped it along. We think we would make it again, but maybe double the garlic and lemon zest.

I really liked this recipe. As I had some leeks also, I steamed them and tossed them with the greens and pasta. Really nice dinner. I can see it would be great with some cubed ham, or left over fish, some shrimp, etc. It lends itself to a lot of potential variety.

Overall a good way to use mustard greens, although I made some changes. First, I didn't have lemons, so I skipped the zest and added a splash of lemon juice at the end. Also, don't bother wilting the greens first--the pasta will do that when you add it. Really fast to make.
