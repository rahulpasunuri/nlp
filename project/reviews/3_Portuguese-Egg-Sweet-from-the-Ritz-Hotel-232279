I have known this recipe for quit a long time, since I used to work at the Ritz in Lisbon. This is a great recipe, though a bit too sweet for me, but otherwise, it's a real keeper! Interestingly, Sericaia was never made for the clients while I was there... instead, we would often make it for the cafeteria because it's quite cheap and yummy! The Ritz wasn't serving that kind of desserts and I was surprised to read they did...
