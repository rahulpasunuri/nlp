I often serve Brie for appetizers, and needed a good outlet for all the leftovers. I found it! This was a fantastic sandwich- my husband said the best ever. I used the thin- sliced beef sirloin from Trader Joes and sauteed it on the stove with the Herbes. I also subsituted micro- greens for the watercress and eliminated the hard-boiled eggs. A final change was the pile on the meat and brie and then broil them to melt the cheese. I then assembled the rest of the sandwish. Delish!

I thought this sandwhich really lacked flavor. I think next time I will use a smaller roll that doesn't consume all of the taste of the other ingediants. Also I would melt the brie and omit the mustard & mayo. Too much bread!

There are only two sandwiches that I have had in my life that I believe are beyond compare. One is Emeril's beef tenderloin with portobello mushrooms,arugula and fontina cheese.This is the other one. Fantastic!!

Taking a cue from others, I subbed a couple of portabella mushrooms for the hard-boiled eggs. I grilled these along with the peppers, putting the tenderloin on the grill when I took the 'shrooms & peppers off. By the time the peppers were ready to peel, the steak was done (a beautiful med-rare). I tented the steak while peeling & slicing the veggies, then sliced the steak. I served these sandwiches warm, toasting the rolls on the grill and not chilling the steak. My husband doesn't like mayonaise so I mixed the mayo with some cilantro pesto and he never knew the difference. I would definitely make these again! The Brie & tenderloin are great together, with the herbes de Provence & Dijon giving just the right amount of oomph.

This was a very filling sandwich. I made some modifications: had no dijon mustard, so I used steak sauce. Also grilled some onions in place of the watercress and didn't use the boiled eggs. Still was very, very yummy!

I thought this recipe was just so, so. While the beef, brie and red peppers were a good combination The eggs just didn't do it for me on this sandwich. I think it would be better toasted to melt the brie and with out the eggs. But I gave it 3 forks any way because it got a 7 year old picky eater to eat a sandwich the size of her head!

This recipe was delicious! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The steak and brie were terrific together, and I loved the charred bell peppers. This is definitely a meal that I can see myself making every once in awhile. Try them, I gurantee that you'll fall in love! (and although they were a bit messy they were definitely worth making)!

This might be one of my new favorite sandwiches! Although it was messy, it tasted delicious, and it was definitely worth making. It won't be too long before I make these again! The only things I changed was I used baby spinach since it was the only thing on hand, and I found a really great sundried tomato bread from my grocery store. The herbs de provence worked beautifully with the steak, and the roasted red peppers were delicious. I can't wait to eat these again!

I made this last night and thought it would be great but My husband and I were really disappointed. We both thought it lacked flavor. Also was not easy to eat with every bite the filling slipped out of the roll. Oh well you never know unless you try.

A bit labor intensive, but worth it. I substituted arugula for watercress; the herbes de provence are essential, as is good bread. delicious and decadent. This was for a picnic in the park served with lots of fresh fruit, perrier, and caramel flan.
