best guacamole ever. Served with red tortilla chips at Xmas and it was colorful and delicious.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly as is and wouldn't change a thing. Served with corn chips instead of making the plantain chips.

As pomegranates are hard to locate after January and are also harder to cleanup than a crime scene, I used Ocean Spray dried cranberries infused with pomegranate juice instead, and my guests raved about the flavor and color of the dish. I will use this substitution from now on.

What a beautiful presentation. It was fresh, had great flavors, and seemed to be a huge hit. I was a bit chicken on the chiles - just used one and omitted the seeds. It was still delicious.

An excellent recipe -- I served with veggie tortilla chips and cassava chips (both from Trader Joe's) - everyone loved the recipe. It needs a good 1-2 teaspoons of salt, which has been omitted from the recipe. It would also be great as a lower calorie appetizer with jicama spears or served on endive leaves.

Terrific!!! I've been making this for a few years now during the holiday season. Just took it to a party last week & everyone loved it. I don't like cilantro, so I leave it out. If I have parsley, I put some in for the look of cilantro without the flavor.

Made this for a girls night get together. Fantastic , added extra mango. Plated it by mixing in mangos and sprinkling pomegranate seeds on top. Served with tortilla chips. I have never made a recipe that created such a positive buzz, everyone wanted the recipe.

Very well received at an asian-inspired dinner party. Definitely a keeper.

We loved this recipe. It's very aesthetically pleasing and the avocado tastes delicious with the fruits. I found the the serrano chiles weren't too spicy because the sweetness of the mango and pomegranate neutralized it a bit. I've made this twice now, and the second time I added strawberries which was also good.

Scrumptious and fast to prepare other than the pomegranates. It's so nutritious with tons of antioxidants!

Delicious but makes a TON. Next time I'll halve the recipe since leftover guacamole doesn't keep for long.

Rating: 4
Exceptional. This recipe is always a hit, even before anyone tries it. I generally add finely minced garlic to jazz it up. I have also substituted frozen corn for the mango due to an allergy and it was great! Add the avocado just prior to serving so it doesn't gum up the gorgeous pomegranate seeds.

This was a big hit at our party. I love the addition of mango to the guacamole, but was not a fan of the pomegranate. I thought the crunch was a little distracting. I will make this again -- sans pomegranate.

Rating: 4
Absolute hit whenever I make this. Style it like the photo with a pile of mango on one side and the pom seeds scattered over the top with minced cilantro. So gorgeous, and also people can see what's in it. I always use really good tortilla chips, but will have to try it with the plantains sometime.

Great recipe. Like bitterginger I served it as an apetizer with the main dish being the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad. My guests loved it.

This is insanely delicious. This was served in a Caribbean themed dinner with the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad and the Pineapple-Chile Margarita both from Epi. The balance of heat from the chilis and sweet contrast in all the dishes was outstanding. I could not get enough of this guac!

I love guacamole, and this is exceptional. The pomegranate seeds are a pain to extract, but well worth the results. It has a lot of fresh and clean flavors with the addition of the cilantro, pomegranate and lime juice. I served this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner, even the picky eaters loved it!

Rating: 4
Excellent. Have made several times, twice for cooking classes, and always a hit. Have had trouble with avocodos ripening on time, so I've taken to making it with 1 1/2 pounds of Wholly Guacamole instead (pricey in supermarkets, but pretty cheap in Costco her in NJ). One serrano was hot enough for me, and since my mango wasn't ready the first time I made it, I've always just made it without mango and it's wonderful.

I have made this recipe twice. It was a total hit at two different Thanksgiving dinners I attended. Served the guacamole with great chips by Plocky's, Red Beans 'N Rice Tortilla Chips. These are awesome chips, a cut above all other brands. Tomorrow I'm going to attempt to make baked plantain chips. Didn't change a thing in the recipe. The pomegranate seeds are a great addition and make the dish very festive.

I served this for thanksgiving (before dinner) and it was a big hit. The yield was huge, there were only 10 of us, so next time I would half it for a small group. Served it with Terra sweet potato chips...yummy!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year, for a crowd I wasn't familiar with... they devoured it! Served it with Terra Chips and it was just amazing! I'm glad the recipe popped up again on this year's hors d'oeuvres recommendations. It's top of my list again!

I make this recipe without the pomegranate and sprinkle a golden roasted flax and chia blend called fitflax on the the top. I heard about FitFlax (www.theflaxdiet.com) on a Prevention board. It is delicious, loaded with Omega 3's, fiber and antioxidants so it not only promotes weight loss, it also is great for your skin, hair and overall health. This flax and chia blend that is nutty, yummy delicious (tastes like peanut butter) that is great straight from the bag, and also tastes great in salads or in greek yogurt. It is also filling.

Whenever I make this guacamole there is none left. The pomegranate adds a great texture and the mango adds sweetness. Def my favorite guac recipe.

Yummy, yummy!. Made for BBQ- all gone! Wouldn't change anything except maybe add a little more mango. I reduced the salt with no problem. The cilantro, peppers, and lime juice bring out the flavor.

This is one of my staples minus the hard to find pomegranates. I throw the onion, jalapeno, and 1-2 cloves of garlic in a food processor so they are nice and fine before adding them to the avocado mixture. The mango is an absolute outstanding accompaniment to the creamy guacamole and every time I have made this it gets rave reviews!

Would love to make this recipe based on all your reviews but sadly, mangoes and pomegranates aren't in season at the same time. I suppose I could go with frozen mangoes but I am concerned that they could be mushy.

The grocer didn't have pomegranates, so I finely chopped a braeburn apple instead. I also added garlic like the other reviewer and some salt. I wouldn't call it the best guac ever, but it was good. Next time I will try lemon instead of the lime juice.

Wow! An easy, pretty, absolutely fantastic guacamole (and I don't normally care for guacamole at all). Didn't change a thing and it was perfect, although I suspect the intensity of the peppers could vary according to location, freshness, etc. (not sure about that).

This is a beautiful and luscious guacamole. It's festive look and fruit sweetness is countered by a nice kick from the serrano chiles. I was concerned that it would be too hot with the seeds included, but it was perfect. I've made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks and it's always a hit.

Delicious- Everybody loved the flavors. I have now made this twice, both times I bought high quality plantain chips to serve with it.

Rating: 4
Phenomenal recipe. I am a huge fan of guacamole, and have high standards for what constitutes "good" guacamole. This one takes the cake. I made this recipe for my family Thanksgiving, and it was demanded back again for Christmas! It is sure to please. TIPS: A little too spicy for some people- just use the seeds from *one* of the serrano chiles for the perfect spiciness. Also, plantain chips weren't a big hit. Tortilla chips work great as an alternative.

Have made this twice recently to rave reviews from guests. It made a nice change from my usual guacamole recipe (though it's a great one too!). I was a bit unsure at first about the mango, but it really works. The combination of flavours and textures makes for a great party dish.

Rating: 4
A definite hit at the party and en a request and a follow-up reminder for the recipe. Really nice twist on a great standby. The color and texture of the pomegranate really made this. I did soak the onions repeatedly after mincing them to remove some of the flavor so it didn't overpower the guac.

This was great! Definitely would make it again. It is for those with a more sophisticated palate!!

Super guacamole maybe the best ever. Made it in the summer and people would not leave the chip and dip table. Will serve again as a starter on my holiday table. this is one you just have to make, it does lend itself to lots of options as well.

First we had this when a friend brought it to our house and it was a huge hit. Next we brought it to a dinner party and no surprise, the same reaction. This will be a great compliment to any holiday table because of the seasonal fruit and red and green coloring. It will also be an amazing addition to a summer table because of the blast of fresh fruit flavor. Bravo!

I took this to a dinner party and it was a hit. I used 3 avocados and a little bit less onion than called for. Amazing. Great for the holidays while the pomegranates are in season and so pretty. I could not find plantains but used tortillas. Really fresh and healthy tasting....because it is!

I couldn't even tell you how many compliments I've gotten for this recipe. It's special requested. People go crazy, hover, can't stop eating or talking about it. It's nothing I've ever experienced with any other food. I always end up quadrupling the recipe. It's definitely become a summer staple.

This is a beautiful recipe - gorgeous display. It is also delicious! I didn't have the mango but the pom seeds made it so wonderful. I had jalapeno instead of serrano and we used blue tortilla chips. My picky husband raved!

Magically Delicious!!!! Used red onion (which IMHO goes great with mango) & omitted pomegranate seeds & cilantro. IT'S THE MANGO. Might add garlic and fresh oregano next time. Or not! I will eat regular old guacamole again, when I can't get a good mango, but I'll be thinking of this.

This salsa is so amazing! Try to include pomegranates, as this is what makes this salsa so special and beautiful. (Trader Joe's carries the seeds in small packages in the refrigerated produce section, as well as presliced mango--big time-savers). You can serve with tortilla chips or the plaintain chips--superb either way. Don't miss this!

I really like guacamole, so I liked this recipe. Everyone I made it for liked it as well. However, I prefer traditional guacamole to this recipe and would not choose to make this recipe over a traditional version again. (To be fair, I couldn't find pomegranate seeds, so I didn't use them.)

Absolutely the best guacamole I've ever had. Hands down. So flavorful and delicious, I made it for my boyfriend but my roommates were scrambling for leftovers (not that there were any)! It's good on any chip but with plantain chips as suggested it is just unbelievable.

Made this as a last minute addition to the party menu and the bowl was licked clean. I used twice as much mango, no POM seeds as I couldn't find them and had to replace the serrano with a habanero. I will definitely make it again.

This was the best guacamole recipe that I have ever tasted. The flavours were fresh and bright. There was a nice balance between sweet and spicy. The colour of the pomegranate added a much needed jewel quality to it because let's face it, guacamole usually looks gross. This is a keeper!

In my opinion guacamole is delicious no matter what... but this recipe was so over and beyond any guacamole that I ever tasted. Maybe it's because I live in Connecticut and we're not really known for our Mexican dishes but really and truly this guacamole is hands down my favorite and in my kitchen... there will be no other. There were no pomegranates available so I just eliminated that item and found that this recipe was so good with just the mango. Next time I'll try it with the pomegranates and plantain chips... but I doubt it could be any better.

I made this for New Years Eve. It was an enormous hit. I would make it again in a heartbeat. We doubled the recipe for a group of 25 people. The pomegrante was the key.

Saw the photo in Gourmet and thought - now that looks delicious. I had plenty of pomegranates on hand, though finding ripe avacados in PA was tricky (so, you might need to plan ahead to ripen your avacados at home). Needless to say - this recipe was beautiful and absolutely delicious. A surprise hit, for sure. We used a dried chile, rather than a serrano, but any mildly hot chile will work. Allow at least two hours in the fridge for the flavors to come together. Everyone wanted the recipe. I'm making it again tonight!

I made this for a Thanksgiving app and everyone loved it. Planning to make it again this week for a party. I doubled the recipe, and it turned out fantastic. The pomegranate adds a little crunch, and a beautiful color. The mango adds the sweetness and the chilis give it just a little heat. Yum!
