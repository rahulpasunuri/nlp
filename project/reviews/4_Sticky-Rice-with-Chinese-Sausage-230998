I love this! I usually just throw things together from memory, but this year, I decided to use a recipe to get the flavor just so. This one rocked! I have to say, I did have to vary the recipe. I pre-cooked the rice for 1/2 hour, which shaved off some of the time, but made the rice a bit gloppy. I also couldn't find chestnuts so I boiled some raw peanuts for a substitute. They were wonderful. The true test was, of course, not only my Chinese heritage tongue, but a group of sophisticated NY Jews, who cook Chinese. They loved it as well.

I really enjoy Chinese food but this was a little too strange for my palate. The Chinese sausage was especially strong and I actually used less than what was recommended. Would not make again.

Delicious! And authentic! Like the other reviewers said, this is just like my (Chinese) mom makes. This recipe is a keeper, and the only thing my (Chinese) husband liked better than the rice was the crispy rice at the bottom.

My 91 year old grandmother was so impressed that I am now forced to make this dish for every holiday, for the past 4 years. She has officially retired from making this and passed the torch due to this recipe. We generally don't use water chestnuts, but it is good either way. Do not dump the water that you soak the mushrooms. Use about half chicken broth and half mushroom water for added umami. Simply fabulous recipe! My mom and aunties are so happy that they can eat without cooking it.

This comes very, very close to my grandmother's famous Chinese sticky rice stuffing we would have every year for Thanksgiving growing up, but of course no one else can reproduce. I'm SHOCKED that this is even on Epicurious quite frankly, and so thankful for Epicurious for posting this. It's as delicious as grandma's (dare I say!) and everyone loved it when I made it. This is pretty easy to make and sooooo good! I might have to make it again this year if I don't get the real thing from Grandma! Hers is really still the best, but this comes in close second!

This was an excellent dish and fairly authentic. I made a few modifications because I didn't have some things on-hand: I omitted chestnuts and substituted Chinese sausage with ground beef seasoned with 1 T soy sauce/1 tsp sesame oil. After cooking the raw ingredients, I mixed the fully cooked beef mixture in with the rice into my rice cooker, added the chicken broth, and finished cooking in the rice cooker. The consistency turned out perfect! Very flavorful and authentic. Will definitely add to my rotation of recipes. My children loved it!

Super yummy - and the best is that I was able to make some authentic Chinese comfort food like-mom-used-to-make for my Taishanese husband! Bonus ...the little ones loved it too!

Absolutely delicious. I made a smaller portion of this dish and it was gone. No leftovers. I would highly recommend. I left out the chestnuts because I am not a fan. Everything was simple and easy to follow.

It was a breeze putting together. It tasted exactly like I remember. I used this as a side dish with Shoyu chicken. Comfort food for a rainy day. I will make this again. Thank you.

This was my first time making this dish. I used this recipe as the basis but I did change it. I halfed the recipe and ommited the chestnuts (did not have any). I added some thinkly sliced pork, some diced shrimp, and fresh shitaki mushrooms. I also used some of the mushroom liquid in addition to some chicken broth.

I have made this several times and each time it has received rave reviews. It also works well as a stuffing for Thanksgiving if you are looking for a slight twist!

Just like my grandmother used to make. Yum!

Delicious. This is Chinese comfort food. It tastes even better than what you would get in a good dim sum restaurant. I used my Le Creuset casserole for all of the steps, including the browning, and it worked out great. There is no need to dirty up an extra pot.

I have made this dish several times. I have been successful in halving it. Absolutely delicious.

I reduced the amount of rice to 2 cups and also proportionally decreased the amount of sausage, which would have otherwise made dish the dish too heavy. Lotus seeds (from Asian supermarkets) make a good substitute for chestnuts. Also, keep the proportion of mushrooms and scallions the same, and add the mushroom soaking liquid (+ chicken broth) to cook the rice: it makes the dish very flavourful.

I haven't actually made this recipe, so my apologies for adding in a fake review. However, the traditional manner of preparing this is to save the liquid that you cooked the mushrooms in and use that as the water for the rice. Sweet rice cooks just like normal rice in a rice cooker, so just add the usual amount of liquid but use your mushroom stock instead of plain water. This is a lot easier than trying to control the consistency of the rice by cooking it in a pot. After the rice is done, stir fry it into the other ingredients.

This was very tasty and received raves from everyone.
