Wow. Easy! (especially with an immersion blender) Awesome balance of tart and sweet and perfectly creamy and smooth. I used my electric ice cream machine and it made a full quart.

This recipe is amazing. The sorbet is so creamy it seems more like a sherbet but without the dairy. I did add a drop or two of red food color to give it a deeper pink color. I was worried my husband wouldn't like it because of the color. I think this recipe is a great summer time dessert; light and refreshing, sweet and tart (like good lemonade). I would even say that you do not have to like rhubarb to love this sorbet.

I just Love this Recipe! I made it last Spring and just couldn't wait until this spring to make it again with the fresh rhubarb from my Garden! This sorbet has the best texture...and stays that way for a long time w/o icing up because of the Natural Pectin in the Rhubarb...this is a Must try!

I made this twice. The second time I added some strawberries that I had on hand. The strawberry flavor came through and made the sorbet less tart. Actualy we preferred the original recipe that was more tart and more rhubarb flavored. Served with the Strawberry Sundie topping from this site. First times making a sorbet. Very easy to make and the result was very smooth. What ever happended to sherbert anyway?

Luscious, unbelievably creamy. For sticklers, mine made a scant 3 cups, that was with 1lb of cleaned rhubarb.

What a wonderfully easy recipe! This was my first try at making sorbet & it tunred out great. I'm always looking for new ways to use our rhubarb. My ice cream maker wasn't working and so I froze it until soft serve stage and stirred it well before freezing it all the way. It still was excellent!

This is so good! If you like rhubarb at all, you'll love it. I made it as a 'palate cleanser' for a rich and delicious meal, and it was a hit. It's a beautiful rose-red color, too. I think next time I'll serve it with a little strawberry sundae sauce. Scrumptious!

This was a fabulous summer dessert--very refreshing. I served it with a fresh strawberry puree. Everyone had seconds.

Who knew that rhubarb would make such a fabulous sorbet! For the lovers of tart, it is the best. I can picture serving it in a tuile cup with sweetened peaches.
