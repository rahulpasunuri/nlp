Okay, I totally messed this up because I was in such a hurry but if done right (and if you can track down the passion fruit) is amazing. First, I would not recommend doing the meringues free-hand if you can help it. I would use miniature heart-shaped pans with removable bottoms as you would with a full-size Pavlova. I was sad that mine didn't turn out but so exhausted at the end of the night we just threw the whip cream, pulp and pieces of meringue on a plate and ate it- and it was wonderful!
