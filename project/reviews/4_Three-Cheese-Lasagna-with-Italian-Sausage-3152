Not that this one needs anymore reviews-but it is a great starting place for a classic Lasagna. We like high meat sauce to pasta ratio so used 1 lb. grd beef, 6 oz each of hot and mild Italian sausage, entire 6 oz can of tomato paste with a bit of water to thin out the sauce. No fresh basil on hand so used 1 T dried sweet basil and 1T from my freezer (summer harvest preserved). As many others I skipped the brown sugar. Used no-boil noodles and made two casseroles one with two layers of 4 noodle sheets per layer and one with two layers of 3 noodle sheets per layer. Topped with a some panko bread crumbs mixed in with the topping parm/mozz cheese blend to give a little crunch to the top. One pan I baked immediately and the other went to the freezer for later. The only thing it needed was a little extra sauce for serving, so opened a jar of Trader Joe's Tomato Basil Marinara. My hubby is still commenting on what a great batch of lasagne it was!

I made this one day in advance for an easy dinner after skiing with friends. Changes I made: used whole frozen tomatoes from my garden, peeled and crushed but not seeded; no brown sugar as suggested by others; used no cook noodles; forgot spinach; doubled the sauce, but had 1.5 quarts left over which I froze ; did not cook with foil. DH liked the meat sauce and requested I make it again two nights later, which was super easy to throw together due to the left over sauce.

This is a wonderful recipe, as noted many times, double the sauce, I left out brown sugar. Also used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and used sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy (Family doesn't handle spicy well) Would serve this any time for pretty much any occasion

Excellent recipe. As others have said, double the sauce. I also found the sausage flavor too strong, even though I used mild rather than spicy. Next time, I'll probably use ground beef in place of the sausage, and increase the seasonings a bit.

Once again, I am reading through the reviews and come upon yet another "world book of useless knowledge--know it all". So what if the recipe doesn't call for ricotta or use a besciamella sauce? I didn't see "authentic" in the recipe title and, to tell the truth, there are no real "authentic" recipes. Every family, every cook adds their own personal touches to a recipe. Not all ground beef or sausage is going to taste the same...if you give two people the same recipe I'll bet you'll taste differences...Plus variety is the spice of life or so they say. I say stop being so nit-picky and enjoy life, food, wine, and dance...

This is hands down my go to lasagna recipe. I usually omit the spinach (picky son) and use 3 boxes of Pomi marinara sauce, 1 lb of mild sausage, 1 lb of low fat ground beef, no carrots or brown sugar, a cup of dry red wine, and De Cecco lasagna pasta that you can use right out of the box to layer into the recipe to save time. Also, instead of the standard sized baking dish, I've used 2 square 8x8" disposable aluminum baking pans with lids to keep on for my family of 2 and either give the other one away to some deserving person or to pop into the freezer. I've also made this recipe as written and it's very good, with the exception of being short on the sauce but with cooking the pasta ahead of layering, you don't need as much sauce.

I have been making this lasagna for years! As reviewers have suggested, leave out the brown sugar... if you use the excellent San Marzano tomatoes from Costco you won't miss it! Even if you don't have access to that tomato, add more carrots to sweeten the sauce (AND make it healthier). I also add add more garlic, a glass of dry red wine (can't hurt), and throw in a piece of Parmigiano-Reggiano rind I keep in the freezer... the longer you let the sauce simmer the better it is! I quadruple the sauce just to have in the freezer... Enjoy!!

A truly decadent, delicious lasagna. Classic flavors, with the added punch of the ricotta. Certainly won't win any healthy awards, but truly appreciated the home-y, comforting winter goodness. Gets a B for easy-ness, A for flavor and A- for texture.

Followed recipe except doubled sauce as suggested by other reviewers, and used no-boil noodles. Delicious right out of the oven and as leftovers. We ate every scrap.

An authentic lasagna always contains either ricotta or a besciamella sauce. Never, ever cottage cheese.

Rating: 3
For the ground beef, use beef with some fat to keep it moist. I agree with other reviews that the sauce should be doubled. Be sure to cover oven for the spilling of the tomato sauce. The noodles should be only 4 across as they should not be piled too much. Cottage Cheese can be used instead of ricotta cheese.

Rating: 4
Maybe I shouldnt be rating this based on my changes but nonetheless it was delicious. Used all ground beef, thats what I had in the freezer, made sure to season it, since sausage would usually have salt in it. Whole wheat lasagna noodles (can't tell the difference). Also ditched the sugar, cut the ricotta and mozza in half, and used fresh spinach, just layered it on the ricotta layer instead of the extra effort of wilting and mixing it in. Bake for 40 with foil, 10 without foil, and it came out perfect.

This is a delicious recipe and some of my guests say THE best they ever had. We make fresh lasagna noodles and homemade ricotta (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Fresh-Homemade-Ricotta-234282). My wife bakes fresh parmesan breadsticks to accompany the lasagna.

Very tasty recipe! I would give it 3.5 forks if I could, but then again, it may not be fair to rate the recipe since I did modify somewhat. Like others, I made 1 1/2 times the sauce and left out the brown sugar. I did not use that much fresh basil, as it seemed like a lot to me. Instead, I supplemented with Italian seasoning blend and some extra dried thyme. I used 2 links of Italian sausage and 6 oz of lean ground beef. I also left out the spinach. I think I let the sauce cook a bit too long, so I used about a cup of the pasta water to correct, and this seemed like a good consistency. I layered the pasta and cheese my own way, as I like several thinner layers. I used nearly all the sauce and cheese, which entirely filled a 13x9 pan. Baked for 40 minutes covered, then 25 uncovered, let rest for 10 and it was delicious, everyone went for seconds :)

great crowd pleaser! i had a roommate h=who made a low fat version, which she really enjoyed, b/c she can't eat fat due to health reasons. We also used ground elk, since that is what we had in the freezer. We did included a little bit of Italian sausage in the regular fat one for the flavor. I would say one and a half the sauce, although you can always use the extra on something else if you double it. The pan just might overflow if you use it all. The more veggies the better too!

I made this for a family get together. It was good but not outstanding. I followed the recipe without changes, except I did take the suggestion to double the sauce. Next time I want to make lasagna I'm going to look for a different recipe.

I have made this twice (once exactly as outlined, once with a few changes) and find it is the easiest lasagna recipe I've tried. I prefered it with all sausage vs the meat combo, feel doubling the sauce itself is best (but not the meat amnt), honestly didn't notice much of a difference with or w/o the brown sugar, and feel you can easily use less ricotta if you so choose. When I made some changes, I used: jarred sauce to save time on a weeknight instead of: crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano and bay leave and it was just fine; used no-boil barilla noodles for 40-45 min covered, 10 under the broiler uncovered; I doubled the sauce amount; and I added slightly more mozzarella cheese. Everyone was very happy with both variations (don't think everyone even noticed the changes I made the 2nd time around). A very good go-to lasagna recipe (I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could) which is easy to adjust according to your time and ingredients on hand!

This lasagne was very yummy! Everyone in my family loved it. I also doubled the sauce and used a 15" x 11" lasagna pan. Left out the spinach. Tons left over to freeze for another meal.

Loved this lasagna! It was a great way to sneak in more vegetables for my kids and it tasted great. After reading the previous reviews, I doubled the sauce (without increasing the meat), omitted the brown sugar, used fresh spinach wilted in the microwave then chopped and squeezed, and halved the amount of ricotta and mozzarella. I cannot imagine this recipe with the full amount of cheese! I had leftover sauce that I look forward to using over pasta.

Forgot to mention in my review below - I also leave out the spinach. Not a fan of spinach in lasagna.

I've been making this lasagne for about 7 years and made it again for friends last night. I doubled the sauce as usual and it was perfect for a 17X11 pan. It was a thing of beauty when I pulled it out of the oven. I now wish I had taken a picture!! It was overfull when I put it in the oven (with pan underneath) but that made for a perfectly wonderful brown bubbly top. It is the most delicious lasagna I've ever had and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe when I make it. And that makes the day of a very mediocre cook!! The only change I make is half spicy/half regular Italian Sausages. I'm from California where we love spicy but I keep it mild for my Canadian friends with a less spicy palate. Always, always delicious!!

I have made this lasagna ever since it appeared on the cover of Bon Appetit in 1997 and I lugged that magazine around with me from move to move over the years, until I figured out it was on the internet! The first time I made it, it came out looking exactly like the magazine cover - all layered and beautiful! And it comes out looking like that every time, which makes it a great choice for entertaining.I have tried many other recipes over the years and none come close to this one! My chef husband says it's the best he's ever had and better than his own! Measure the sauce carefully or you will come up a bit short.I don't like a whole lot of sauce but if you do, make extra. This is a go-to recipe for sure!! It gets thumbs up all around, including from my own parents, about as Italian as they come!

This is pretty good lasagna. I followed the recipe. I'd leave out the sugar next time, add more oregano and basil, add a little nutmeg to the sauce, use more olive oil, and maybe try fresh mozzarella. I'd consider using some chopped black olives in the ricotta. I made a double recipe of the sauce but didn't need any more than the lasagna recipe called for. The sauce should freeze well.

Really enjoyed this recipe on a snowy day. Made the recipe as stated. The grated carrots added a subtle sweetness. I did double the sauce, but served the extra on the side. This is a hearty rendition and made especially flavorful with locally-made Canino's Italian sausage. I used regular lasagna noodles that were left to soak in hot tap water for an hour, and after assembly, it sat in the refrigerator overnight. Baked up perfectly. Family and guests didn't leave a crumb. Next time, I will make 2 pans in hopes of having left-overs.

It's unclear why this recipe is so popular. I didn't find it to be anything special. It was good, but not amazing. I actually found it lacking in many ways. It was way too ricotta heavy. Next time, I would consider cutting the amount of ricotta in half and adding some feta or even pesto to the mixture to give it more of a kick. I would also cut the mozzarella in half, and add 1/2 cup more parmesan. Also, equal parts ground beef and ground pork, or possibly even heavier on the pork. I had ample sauce.

After I made this, I had decided it took too long and would look for a quicker recipie - UTNIL I TASTED IT. WOW. Substituted mushrooms for carrots and only used one tub of ricotta and mixed it with a bechamel sauce with about one cup of emmenthaler cheese.

Made this last night with whatever was found in the kitchen. Mixed Italian hot sausage with sweet sausage, did not use beef at all. Added mushrooms to sauce. I did not double the sauce and did not think I needed to. Perhaps sausage is juicier then beef. It turned out scrumptious and everyone had seconds. Next time I will skip brown sugar. I don't think it worked well with the rest of the flavors.

One of the best recipes I've made. I used ground turkey in place of the beef and used one egg and 2 egg whites since my hubby is trying to lower his cholesterol and it tasted great. Thought it would have been better with no brown suger and added a splash of red wine in the sauce for added richness. Definitely needed a deep pan and was glad that I had a sheet pan underneath to catch the drippings!

I've been making this since it was first published, and it really is the best. I just tried making it with fresh pasta sheets for the first time and I'm happy to report that it worked great and saved a whole, messy step. I'll never use the dried again! Also, if you have a pan with 3" high sides, I think it's best made by doubling the sauce; just don't do it if your pan isn't deep enough.

DELICIOUS! Worth the effort. Everyone raved about this lasagna. It was heavenly. I doubled the sauce (only used 12 oz of beef) and omitted the brown sugar (I don't like it sweet). I used 3 cups of ricotta - which was a smart move - I could barely fit all the ingredients in the pan, and I had about 2 cups of sauce left over - there wasn't any room! I put a cookie sheet underneath, which was smart b/c it bubbled over. The last few minutes of cooking I put the oven on broil and left the lasagna on it's shelf - it browned perfectly. heaven!

Perhaps I was sold by all the rave reviews of this recipe and, yes, the flavor was great. BUT, this was the heaviest lasagne I (or my guests) have ever eaten! As suggested, I doubled the sauce recipe and followed it to a T, though I did not use all the doubled amount. I do believe that the reason the sauce is so sparse in the recipe is exactly because it does contribute to the heaviness. Next time I will omit the sausage completely and only increase the sauce by a quarter or half. All in all, this is not my favorite lasagne and my guests didn't compliment it. Maybe it was our California palettes!? :-)

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I followed the suggestions and doubled the sauce recipe and it was perfect. This was an easy recipe to prepare and put together.

This is a great recipe, even got rave reviews from my Italian in-laws! Do make it a parmesan/romano mix, as other reviews have mentioned. My meat sauce is not the one from this recipe, but similar. I take a hand blender to the sauce (after removing bay leaf) and smooth it out. The carrots add enough sweetness that you don't need sugar. Oh, and definitely double the sauce recipe, even if you don't use it all in the lasagna. Freezes great!

I up the red pepper flakes to 1 TBSP - this makes it a little spicy but all the cheese tones that down. My family said "it's the best lasagna I've ever had."

I have been making this recipe for 12 years for Christmas Eve, New Years Eve, and Super Bowl gatherings, since it was first published in Bon Appetit back in 1997. Every time I make it I get rave reviews. People always comment on the hearty flavor and are surprised by the carrots -- leave them in! I always double the sauce, and sometimes double the entire recipe again to make two huge pans that will serve 20+ people with some leftovers to share. I usually just serve it with an italian-style green salad and garlic bread, which is plenty because everyone has seconds (and sometimes thirds) of the lasagna.

I have made this recipe three years in a row now for New Year's. We did it to the letter originally and it was great, but since we made some minor changes - replace beef with veal (more tender), added 4 oz of cream cheese to the cheese mixture (it smoothes it out really nicely), half parm and half romano (to make the cheese a little more complex), we also added 3 oz of fire roasted red peppers to the puree which was great, and we use a little more garlic and olive oil. Sometimes we do the spinach, sometimes we don't. It's great either way.

Delicious and very forgiving! I used 2 bags of fresh spinach chopped up instead of frozen, 9 no-boil noodles (reduced total cook time to 45 min), and an italian cheese blend instead of the provolone. I also just made my own marinara that was very chunky and the lasagna still came out great.

Excellent, hearty, traditional Italian-style Lasagna!!! I made two pans for a dinner party one with meat, one without. RAVE reviews from EVERYONE at the party. I doubled the sauce for both pans and didn't add carrot to either the meat sauce or the non meat sauce. That is the only thing I changed. I'm making it again tomorrow night for another dinner party. This will be my staple lasagna recipe for sure!!! Thank you!!!!!!

This is the best lasagna I've made and it got rave reviews from my very picky brother who has lots of Italian friends. I read previous reviews and adjusted this way: 1. doubled the sauce ingredients EXCEPT the meat... 2. used 3 lbs of Italian sausage (half sweet half hot) and no beef. Doubling the sauce is definitely a good move, but it makes a HUGE lasagna. You could, alternatively, halve the REST of the ingredients and make a smaller square lasagna. It seems like a lot to do, but it comes together pretty easily!

really great sauce. just used hot italian sausage (no beef)and added celery and a splash of balsamic vinegar. And I doubled the sauce... thank God, because I could have even used a tad more!!! There was waaaay too much ricotta mixture, I only used half.But I added fresh parsley and basil to the mixture. Nice touch. Definitely not a runny lasagna. I used low fat cheeses. I think the mozzerella should've been full fat.

Rating: 4
Took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the sauce -- perfect! I also took the called-for parmesan and did a 50/50 mix of parm and romano. The romano is a saltier, stronger flavor and really bumps it up. I also omitted the carrots and used a full lb of the spicy Italian sausages (for the doubled sauce). 15 lasagna noodles (one Barilla box) was just right, and I used fresh spinach in my ricotta mix (steamed it in the bag and chopped it up). Great!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. A little heavy on the ricotta/spinach combo; next time I'll reduce the amount of ricotta. Also, as the sauce was delicious and there wasn't quite enough of it, next time I'll double the sauce, and I'll use the extra for serving with pasta later.

Great recipe! Doubled the sauce but had to use two pans, my glass 13x9 wasn't deep enough and still bubbled over a bit and burned on the bottom of the oven. Needed a little more salt to bring out the flavors. Very hearty!

This recipe would easily have been four forks had it called for more sauce. I did take the other reviewer's advice and doubled the sauce and frankly it could have even used more. Having said that the flavor was delicious! I made a pan of the meat as listed and for my vegetarian friends used the sauce recipe and instead of meat added broccoli and zucchini. The entire dinner was filled with sounds of chewing and mmm-ing! It's a very hearty, filling recipe with wonderful flavors. Definitely a keeper!

Ever wonder what to do with those giant zucchini that are so abundant? Try making this lasagna recipe using the zucchini instead of noodles. Slice the zukes long ways about 1/4" thick, salt & pepper, brush with oil and grill until brown. Use grilled zuke slices in place of noodles. With 509 reviews I question whether this will get read; but I hope so it's a great alternative.

Really exceptional! Do follow the suggestions offered by mirandanicole from Hamilton, Bermuda on 06/25/09 where the key suggestion is to double the sauce. My one note-worthy suggestion is to be sure and use fresh basil (rather than the dried herb variation) ... it truly makes a difference. Served with garlic bread and steamed green beans with some crisped pancetta on top.

I forgot the darn spinach - and this dish was still great. I especially loved the sauce...it was easy to make and was very delicious.

I doubled this recipe when I served it to my family of seven (we have some boys who are big eaters), but only one slice was taken from the second pan. This ia a very hearty lasagna! I did not make more sauce than the recipe required, but I did run out and had to use storebought sauce on the top layer. I think making 1.5 times the sauce would cover it and maybe have a little left over. I had sweet - not spicy - sausage, so I just added more red pepper to compensate. Didn't add tomato paste to the sauce, and used dried basil instead of fresh. I found that the sauce needed a little bit of salt to fully bring out the flavor. Other than that, it was perfect. A definite keeper - though it took me three hours to make!

My wife loved this. She was very skeptical because she grew up hating lasagna. The heat translated well from the spicy sausage and the red pepper flake. Adding the egg to the ricotta made it very hearty which I enjoyed. I normally split my ricotta with half large-curd cottage cheese but I took a chance with this recipe and it payed off. The speed this recipe can be put together, makes it a definate repeat for me. If you know your way around a kitchen you could put this together in a half-hour easily.

For the first time ever I took a risk and used a recipe I had never tried before for a dinner party. Just as many others have mentioned it was a HUGE hit! I read through the suggestions before making it, and here are the changes I made (which definitely worked): 1. DOUBLE THE SAUCE! 2. Use 1 lb of each meat ingredient 3. Use sweet sausage and spicy sausage 4. When doubling the sauce, do not double the brown sugar 5. Add fresh mushrooms to sauce 6. Add extra spinach to ricotta mixture (I used whole ricotta, not skim) 7. Make sure to use a deep dish, I used 13 X 9 deep dish and broke up extra noodles to extend the length of the lasagna 8. Make sure to drain water from the ricotta and the spinach 9. Use extra cheese, mozzarella slices work great 10. Do not follow the amounts suggested for sauce when layering the lasagna, always use extra so the sauce is thick. **use no-boil lasanga noodles to cut back time! Thank you everyone for the great suggestions! This took me a couple hours from start to finish, so I suggest making it ahead and storing it in the fridge until about 1 1/2 hours before you wish to serve it.

Rating: 4
I used whole ricotta not skim. 2 large cans of San Marzano crushed tomatoes and 2 small cans of tomato paste thinned out with some leftover chicken broth was an excellent way to double the sauce recipe. I also used whole mozzarella not skim. If you are going to make this dish, don't cut out flavor to save a few calories. It doesn't make sense. Enjoy!

This lasagna was exceptional. I substituted the ricotta cheese with cottage cheese and omitted the ground beef, using only sausage. I also used 'no cook' lasagna noodles.

Doubled the sauce and grated the carrots as others had recommended. Squeezed a bit of lemon juice into the ricotta mixture. Used an extra large lasagna pan to fit four noodles lengthwise and one across the bottom. All the sauce got used up for the lasagna - I was hoping for some extra to freeze!

Added red wine and chopped fresh garden tomatoes to the sauce and some freshly grated nutmeg and garlic to the ricotta mixture. I also never boil lasagna noodles, I just layer them uncooked and make sure they are completely covered with sauce. Also only 3 noodles fit my lasagna pan so I used 12 in all. Grate the carrots, as I saw a Sicilian colleague do, and it melts into the sauce. A hearty and homey delicious lasagna.

I have made this several times now and it gets rave reviews from my guests every time. I use a Mario Batali 13.5 x 9.5 x 4" deep cast iron/enamel pan. To fill this up I double the sauce recipe using two pounds of lean ground meat - generally a mix of spicy sausage and a veal/beef combo. I add 8 - 12 oz mushrooms and a chunked red pepper to the sauce. I need 32 oz of part skim ricotta (not 30 oz) and double the cheese: two pounds of part skim or light mozzarella and 6 oz of parmesan. The Batali pan is large so it uses 18 total noodels: 6 noodles per layer - 5 long and 1 short. Try putting the top layer of mozzarella on after the first bake with the foil so the cheese doesn't stick to it. edit this note :

I also throw the carrots, onion and garlic in the food processor to chop (I hate chopping carrots!)so that my sauce is smoother. I use oven ready noodles and make 1.5Xs the sauce.

Any lasagna recipe with a major boo-boo such as this one deserves a place in the shredder. After following the recipe exactly (except for making additional sauce - thanks to reviews), I wound up staring at the naked noodles on the top layer with not a drop of sauce left to cover them. So I went back to the stove and made even more sauce to finish the job. I am sure the flavor of this lasagna will be very nice, as are most lasagnas. It's just that the recipe is WRONG.

This lasagne was good. I think we could have done without the carrots. The sauce was super chunky- a better sauce would have made the world of difference.

Made this for family for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit...I did use extra sauce, not sure how much, but probably double the amount called for...GREAT RECIPE!! (especially to make ahead)

This is hands down the best lasagna recipe. I have made it for Christmas Day dinner for several years and it is always a huge hit. I make the sauce on 12/23(4 times recipe amounts) for 2 lasagnas (I don't double the spinach). I increase all spices significantly to taste. I assemble the casseroles on Christmas Eve morning and wrap as instructed. There will be a little sauce left over for later. Very easy dinner for a relaxing Christmas with a family that loves to eat!

This is my favorite lasagne recipe! You do need extra sauce--about 1/2 recipe more that is stated. I have been making this recipe for years & my recipe is so stained that I am printing a new one from Epicurious!

I made a few modifications...some planned some by chance. I had a 9x13 glass dish as the recipe called for but had overflow issues because it was only 2 inches deep...so go for at least 3 inches. I didn't 1.5 the sauce and was forced to run to the store mid-assemblage for some jarred muck. Definitely make extra sauce! I added some red wine to the sauce, extra basil, and put a little extra parm on top and in the ricotta mixture which all were nice touches. Everybody loved it...I would absolutely make it again and next time might nix the hamburg for spicy sausage.

very good recipe. I will make it again. I upped the meat to one pound of each and this worked perfectly. I think I used too much cheese so it was a little on the rich side but still, my hubby was in heaven and we both cleaned our plates.

OMG! This is the best lasanga ever. I have been searching for the perfect recipie and this is it. I have made it several times and every time I get rave reviews and special requests to make it again. My parents even bought me a deep dish Lasaga pan to encourge me to make it more often! I typically 1.5 times the sauce, it seems to be a little light and I have added 2 tbs sour cream to the Ricotta mixture to keep it moist. One word of caution for the Ricotta mixture, don't forget to drain the ricotta and spinich to get as much water out as possible and don't forget to add the eggs or the center will be runny and won't set. Enjoy!

I had to omit the meat since I follow the kosher dietary laws which forbid meat & dairy together. So on my husband's suggestion I added peas for volume. Will have to double the sauce next time though. It got rave reviews from my husband, kids & all our guests!

i only used ground beef and added fennel seeds instead of using italian sausage. (hard to find quality sausage without msg) i also nixed the carrots and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese. it turned out to be the best lasagna i have made in my short life:) the consistency was perfect as well as the taste!

We had another couple over for dinner last night so I made this lasagna. I made the sauce the night before (doubled it like most said I should) and I'm so glad I did because what I didn't use is now in the freezer because its SOOOOOOO good! My fiance loves lasagna especially his mothers and said I would have a hard time making it better than her. But sure enough I did. And this is now one of his top 3 dinners I make. Definitely double the sauce and if you have a bigger dish use it because mine was not deep enough. And it weighed a ton!

Rating: 4
Give yourself lots of time and enjoy making this. It's time consuming but fun. My Corningware deep French white oval casserole wasn't big enough so I had to use a second, smaller dish for the excess. I added a few of my home-grown tomatoes to the sauce, and used a full pound each of ground beef and Italian sausage. I made sure to cook the sauce down so it was thick. Also, there's no need to wait for the sauce to cool before assembling. Great lasagne!

This is a wonderful recipe, made it last night for a birthday dinner, and it was a hit. I doubled the sauce as suggested by others, and used a big pan, which was probably a 10x14, but could have used an even bigger pan, so next time I will use my larger turkey roasting pan. The sauce is just delicious. I also used one 32 oz. carton of ricotta, and one lb. mild Italian sausage, and one hot Italian sausage. No ground beef, and it was just great. Give it a try, I think you'll like it.

Oh, this was good lasagna! I actually halved it to make a 9x9, but left the sauce as the recipe called, and it worked out great. I really needed a deeper pan though - a 3" depth would have been great.

Good but not great. You need to AT LEAST double the sauce. I've made it twice now. It's better with equal parts of sausage and ground meat.

I made this to take to work for a coworkers birthday lunch. I was such a hit, everyone loved and went back for seconds! Made it as written, didn't double the sauce but maybe 1 1/2 times more and I used 1 pound of spicy sausage. Best lasagna I ever made so definitely will make again.

Rating: 4
With the exception of using fresh spinanch, I did everything as written but doubled the sauce. Like somebody said, what's wrong with left over delicious sauce??? The whole thing was a little more watery than I would have liked but that affected presentation, not taste. Smash hit, all guests loved it. Glad there are leftovers. Easy to make, will do again for sure!!!

Rating: 1
What did I do wrong? As many reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce (all ingredients - including the meat.) The sauce seemed very thick, so I added 1 8- ounce can of tomato sauce. The finished dish was very "dry" - and not nearly as cheesy tasting as I expected. Since so many reviewers gave this 4 forks, I MUST have done something wrong! Any thoughts on this - it sounded so good! Thanks!

Rating: 4
Great balance of sweet (carrots, sugar) and spicy (peppers, hot italian sausages). For sure get a monster sized pan - like, a good 3" deep pan would make sense. Yes, make more sauce but double is too much. 1.5 is about right, although nobody will complain about leftover sauce. I did find the sauce to be a little thick; perhaps it was because the tomatoes I used didn't have "added puree". Red wine to the rescue! Otherwise it would have been a little glue-y.

Rating: 4
I've made this lasagna three times, and I've found that the following modifications work best: double the sauce, add 50% more spinach in the ricotta mixture and layer the ricotta with thick slices of mozzarella. Also, I layer the bottom with sauce, then noodles, then one thick layer of ricotta and mozzarella, then noodles, then sauce, topped off with mozzarella. I also sprinkle parsley flakes on top for show. Fewer layers makes the lasagna WAY better.

Terrific recipe much akin to my grandmother's. I used fresh spinach and my own fresh-made pasta (a bit less than 3/4 lb; used KitchenAid's roller setting #5 for this 2:1 semolina:unbleached flour recipe). I also liked the flavor from using a 2:1 mix of sweet:hot sausage instead of using beef. This might take several hours from start to finish, but the end product is worth it.

It can't be said enough: double the sauce and use a deep pan. My guests loved this lasagna. I made it a day ahead and baked it for a dinner party. It was truly delicious.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved. They said that it was the best lasagna they had ever had. I did double the sauce (good thing). My only suggestion is the addition of salt. I felt that it was a tad bland. However, I am own worst critic.

I hate to be the voice of dissent, but this is just "good". For me that could just as easily read "ho hum". Way too much prep, time & money (add up those cheeses...it gets up there!), for such a humdrum result. There's better formulas for lasagna out there.

Delicious. I used fresh spinach that i chopped up in the food processor. I would prefer a little more heat. As for the cheese sticking to the tin foil, i didn't have any toothpicks, so i sprayed the foil with cooking spray and tented it as best as i could.

Excellent flavor and presentation. However, if you wish to make all three layers that this recipe calls for, you will definitely need a larger pan than a 9x13. I only did two noodle layers, but either way, I highly recommend that you double the sauce recipe for certain. My friends loved it! This recipe is a keeper and will be made many times over.

This has been my standby lasagna for a few years. I use all sausage instead of ground beef - but that is the only adjustment I make. Amazing every time! I too double the sauce and use a bigger pan. The sauce alone is amazing - I freeze the left over sauce to use with pasta later.

I've made it as directed and then modified and this is still a great recipe. As everyone else recommends: double the sauce recipe, use prebaked noodles. Then I substitute Boca crumbles instead of meat (sausage flavor is better), and use 14-20 oz frozen spinach (but I like spinach). I make sure I have enough mozarella but given my pan depth or my assembly, I usually end up using only 4 cups (not on purpose). Fantastic!

I should have followed other reviewers suggestions and thrown in more crushed tomato into my sauce since i felt like I had to be skimpy but it still turned out great.

It came out pretty good. I did double the tomatoes and also used about 1 lb. beef and 9 ounces of sausage. The only problem I had was that the mozzarella on the top stuck to the aluminum foil. I also used a somewhat larger pan, and made the layers more traditional - one of the ricotta mixture and one of just the sauce. My pan was not glass, but ceramic, and was 13.5 x 10.5 and deep. I shouldn't have used a whole box of lasagna because I've got half left over. It's also very kid friendly.

Rating: 4
Thanks reviewers for the tip about doubling the sauce! I made this recipe for a banquet dinner and got rave reviews. I multiplied the recipe by 5 to get the right amount of lasagna to serve, for some reason I had a lot of leftover mozzarella and ricotta mixture. Nonetheless it tasted fantastic, I would even argue because of the leftover cheese that you could reduce the amount required by 1/5 and it'll still taste great.

Excellent! Used sliced fresh mozzarella as well as shredded. Also, didn't have fresh basil so used dried flakes - still very flavorful. Doubled the sauce as recommended by other reviewers and used every bit of it. People asked for seconds and thirds so use a big deep dish pan!

I used no-boil noodles in a 14x9 inch pan, 4 noodles per layer (will not touch the long sides of the pan). I doubled sauce as recommended but next time I would throw another can of tomatoes in. I made an additional layer because I expected this to flatten out. Make sure this is at room temp before baking, it takes too long otherwise and the top burns.

I also doubled the sauce. I used whole wheat noodles and did not precook them. I just added some water to the sauce and checked it periodically to see if it needed more liquid, which it did not. it took 30" longer to cook, but that may be Denver altitude. Also, did not divide into two containers, would definitely do that next time. It did need to sit overnight for the flavors to develop. Next timeI will add fennel and more oregano.

Well, the empty pan speaks for itself! This recipe is a wonderful base for a delicious lasagne. I agree with previous reviews who suggest doubling the sauce, or at least making 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe. I used all ground beef, since that was what I had in the fridge, and only used garlic, not the other veggies, as my husband doesn't like carrots or onions. I used a 28oz can tomato puree, added a little extra of the tomato paste, and then added the other ingredients. After allowing it to simmer about ten minutes, I tasted the sauce and added a little more red pepper, for 'kick', a little more brown sugar, and a little salt, to round out the tastes. The sauce alone was seriously addictive. Which brings me to the only problem I had in assembling this recipe... not enough sauce. I would have liked to have a saucier lasagne... but it still tasted incredible! Cheesy and delicious - our guests finished the entire lasagne in one sitting!!!

I'm making this for a girls weekend and wondering if the sauce is supposed to be very thick. Mine is and since I usually make my own "gravy" this seems thicker than I'm used to. I'm also glad I read the reviews... doubling the sauce recipe seems like a good idea!

best lasagna i've ever made! thank you!! i used fresh spinach, mozzarella and parmesan...i will definitely keept hat as a twist to this! experiencing the "fresh" flavor instead of the overly- melty, prepackaged one that usually comes with lasagna was a super change. i also added a little bit of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture which gave a great touch. overall, i'm so glad i don't have to search out another lasagna recipe again!

I love this lasagna. I baked it today and it is absolutely beautiful and all the noodles were covered by the liquid in the lasagna. The pan seemed extremely full, but nothing overflowed in baking.

All who have tried "my" lasagna are impressed.

I make this dish several times a year, especially around the holidays. When well sealed, it will freeze well for as long as a month. Make sure you get as much moisture as possible out of the spinach and dry off the cooked noodles with a towel. This keeps the dish from being soggy. Carrots add nice depth of flavor.

I made this last night with a few adjustments...I used 1 jar ricotta and 1 jar 1% cottage cheese and also halved the suggested amount of mozzarella to make it slightly more health conscious--still delicious and a managed to erase a lot of the calories. I'm not really sure why people are saying that the recipe needs more mozzarella because 2 c. as opposed to 4.5 c. just fine. Definitely use a deep dish as I had to put a cookie sheet underneath the dish because it was about to spill over the sides of the pan after I completed all the ingredients. Love lasagne; first time with this recipe and will definitely make it again.

This recipe can also be made vegetarian! Just substitute with fake ground beef and Tofurky Italian sausage -- still delicious, but healthier and meat-free. Also I agree, needs more sauce.

Awesome lasagna! It's time consuming, but worth it! My husband usually requests this around his birthday...how could I say no? I ALWAYS double the sauce.

Amazing dish, even impressed my sister's Italian boyfriend whom previous to this refused to eat any lasagna not made by his mother!

THE BEST EVER LASAGNE! My husband, although addicted to anything tomato and cheese, has never been a fan of lasagne and I don't especially like ground beef or sausage, but I was looking for a recipe similar to a fabulous (meatless) pasta dish we recently had at the Mohonk Mountain House in New York when I stumbled on this and decided to try it. I listened to the other reviewers and doubled the sauce (a must), used Barilla Lasagne (no boiling) noodles which are flatter and a little more like homemade, followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written, and this is the best lasagne we have ever eaten. Don't leave out the Italian sausages or the crushed red pepper because they add just the right amount of zing. My husband tasted the sauce before I put the lasagne together and thought the sauce might be a little too spicy (he is a mild salsa eater and I prefer hot salsa) but after the noodles and cheeses are added, we agreed that it was perfect. In fact, don't leave out anything in this wonderful dish. Thank you Amy Bond! You have given us one of our very favorite meals and a great, foolproof dish we can prepare ahead for dinner parties.

to Saskatoon..... the suace portion of recipe...says "Cover and simmer until flavors blend and sauce measures about 5 cups." This is not just the liquid or only the liquid, this means the whole deal, meat and all .....no wonder why you couldnt taste anything else. Carrotts, though round are easy to chop. First, take and cut in half across as to shorten the carrott, then careful take a small slice as to be able to lay the carrott down on a flat edge, then slice down into four or five wafers, turn on their side and chop away. Give this lasagna another try and dont add 5 cups of tomatoe sauce. Good Luck and happy holidays!

Rating: 4
This is absolutely the BEST lasagna! To the cook from Saskatoon - I believe your problem was with the ingredients. First, "28 oz. crushed tomatoes with added puree" - that's the description you look for on the can. The recipe isn't vague, really. The right can will say "Crushed tomatoes with added puree". That's what you want. And ground pepperoni - WAY different from spicy sausage. Regarding the crushed dried red pepper - if you look in your baking aisle in the spices, you'll see what the recipe calls for: dried red pepper. Is that what you used? You can certainly tweek the amounts of everything. But please do give it another try with the right ingredients -I made this last weekend and my guests declared that it's the only lasagna they will ever want. Good luck!

The only reason I'm writing this is because I was so surprised at the quality of this lasagna after reading all the rave reviews!! I followed the recipe closely - except where it says you should have 5 cups of sauce - there's that vague bit about "added puree" - I added tomato sauce to make up the 5 cups. Also had to substitute ground pepperoni for the spicy italian sausage. But I couldn't taste the oregano or hot dried chile peppers and only a hint of basil. I'll never chop carrots again (maybe I just have a crap knife). In short, it was ALOT of work for a mediocre lasagna - any suggestions what I did wrong?

Great recipe. I have made it 5 times now and my favorite variations are: I used 12 ounces of Ground Buffalo (rather than ground beef) and also added 6 ounces of Sweet Italian sausage along with the hot Italian sausage, because we like ours a little meatier. I also used 15 ozs of Ricotta and used 16 ounces of mozzarella and 8 ounces of sliced Provolone (not mixed in with the cheese, but as a layer. This makes a VERY large pan of lasagna, but we have a family of 6. Tonight when I made it, I tried those new oven-ready lasagna noodles you can buy that don't require pre-cooking. They really taste good! I was suprised. This one is fairly painless to make.. I big hit

I doubled the sauce and left out the ground beef and this was the best lasagna I have ever had!!! My husband, who's the chef, I normally don't cook, raved about it all night!!! It's the perfect combination of sweet & spice. I did add some extra red pepper flakes and some italian seasoning (but I like it hot!) to the sauce to add a bit of a kick. I poured two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc and made my own garlic bread to go with it and it was a perfect romantic dinner. (The Garlic bread was made with a loaf of french bread cut into large pieces, and coated with a mixture of melted butter, crushed garlic, and italian seasoning then broiled for a few minutes while the lasagna cooled)

Made this for my boyfriend who specifically requested lasagna. This was my first time making lasagna and this recipe was a home run! Definitely double the sauce recipe as you will need to since the sauce is very thick and flavourful.Personally, I would have added more red peppper seeds, and probably more dried herbs, because I like food that is powerfully flavoured. But this recipe is very good on it's own. And there is a lot of room to improvise. Plus, it presents beautifully. Very good

I doubled the sauce and added grated provolone to the lasagna - very good. I also added extra chili peppers & used no cook noodles without any problems (let them soak in warm water while you make the sauce). Next time I will try using basil in the filling instead of spinach. It made one deep dish 13x9 with left over filling & sauce for another 7x7 dish. Excellent!

This recipe is excellent! I've made it several times and my husband enjoys it thoroughly. Using the food processor makes things a lot easier -- I never change a thing, though I add cinnamon to the sauce

P.S....a great tip....my cousin "hates" garlic so i use a microplane...hates the idea of big chunks of it but actually loves the taste.....plus, my mothet buys jalapeno chilis in bulk from our produce store....she then grinds it up in a food processor, seeds and all, keeps it in a tupperware container, so I just add spoonfuls of it when needed...you can freeze it too.....it sounds weird but it is so convenient and great and yummy. Just a tip!! Happy cooking!

Great recipe....but minus the sugar and carrots....I use Hot Italian sausage......I actually add more meat than is required in the recipe..l just throw in the whole package rather than measuring.....I know that sugar and carrots can help sweeten an acidic tomato sauce, but I have never really tasted a need for it and it seems a bit unnecessary....I made this lasagna in HUGE batches for my brother's engagement parties and it was a great hit. I made the lasagnas, froze them, and just let them defrost in the fridge the morning of his crazy party days.....they were gobbled up like nobody's business. Thank you for this recipe!!

Home run! I cooked for my wife's birthday feeding nine hungry adults and ten children. On the side was Italian bread, halved, spread with butter and minced garlic, fresh parmesan, and paprika open face under a hot broiler. The only complaint was from my mother's Swedish tastebuds which are more accustomed to lutefisk than hot Italian sausage. Everyone else stuffed themselves. Heeding the advice of previous reviewers I doubled the entire sauce portion. The spinach (which I did NOT squeeze dry) and carrots were a nice touch. I added 2 tsp of coriander and garnished with sliced black olives and will add mushrooms next time. USE A DEEP PAN!

Absolutely my favorite lasagna recipe! I've been using this as my primary lasagna recipe since it was first published in 1997. Has always gotten rave reviews from friends and family. Time consuming but well worth it! As with other reviews on this recipe, I double the sauce. Otherwise I find it comes out too dry.

This was a wonderful lasagne. I took the advice from other reviewers and doubled the sauce, I can't imagine not doing so. Even doubled it still needed every bit of extra sauce.

After reading all the rave reviews of this dish, I decided to make it. My husband was really looking forward to it. We sat down to eat and after a few mouthfuls he said "This is okay, it's good and all but not as good as the other lasagna you make" (Which is Emeril Lagasse's recipe for Lasagna Bologonese) I have to say I agreed with him. I followed this recipe to a tee and I don't see what makes this so spectacular. I'll admit that as the sauce was cooking and I was dipping in to taste, I thought it was pretty good, but for some reason the lasagna as a whole disappointed. It just didn't live up to the reviews. Hopefully, it will taste better tomorrow! Take care all and have a wonderful New Year!!

This was the best lasagna I've ever made. My husband rated it an 11 on a scale of 1-10 and he's a very honest guy! Made a few changes which I'm very happy with: doubled the sauce, used ground chuck (more flavor), added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the sauce and about 3 tablespoons of goat cheese to the cheese mixture. Really loved the way the cheese mixture firms up - wasn't runny at all. It was delicious! Will add to my keeper recipe book for sure!

Made this Lasagna last night for dinner, yummy!!! Since my husband and I dont eat beef or pork, I made the sauce with tofurkey italian sausage (meatless), and morningstar ground beef crumbles (meatless). For the sausage i pulsed in the food processor to break it up into small pieces. I doubled the sauce, but didnt use all of it. Lasagna went to the top of my pan! Overall great dish and I will definately make it again.

I have made this lasagna a couple of times, and decided that it is the best I have ever had. It may replace my recipe that I have used for the last 32 years, and that was a good one also. This just has so much extra with the carrots and spinich. The carrots give it a little natural sweetness. I did not increase the amount of sauce, but I will next time. Awesome lasagna!!!

I made this recipe for a dinner party of 12 on the recommendation of a friend from Berkeley, it's her favorite lasagne - and it did not disappoint! The guys literally inhaled it and right went right back for more, even the women had seconds. The sauce is stunning, although I doubled the sauce portion of the recipe (only) following others suggestions, you really do need to. The Spicy Italian sausage "makes" it sing. This is my new base sauce recipe - for everything! Loved it. Served it with the Roasted Yellow Pepper bruschetta and a salad.

Rating: 4
Double this rather thick sauce, and thin it somewhat with some red wine or water if you're using no-cook noodles. Don't put it all in the pan---use about half of the sauce and serve the rest on the side. Then you won't have soupy lasagne. It slices and serves beautifully.

I've made this several times, it's fanastic -- recently, out of necessity, I omitted ground beef and used hot italian turkey sausage (and slightly upped the amount of carrots). Turned out less heavy but just as delicious. And yes, double the sauce. Whatever you might have left over goes great on pasta and is worth the extra trouble. This time, didnt precook the noodles and was slightly dry the next day ... should have added a bit of water when assembling (?).

Loved it! I doubled the sauce but found that I couldn't possibly fit all the ingredients into a true 13x9 pan. I didn't cook the noodles prior and it turned out just fine(I did add 1/4cup of water to the bottom layer) so skip cooking the noodles. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

The perfect comfort food! Definitely double the sauce. I split the recipe into two 8 x 8 pans. I cooked one right away. For the other one, I lined the baking pan with Press'n Seal wrap, assembled the lasagna and placed the pan in the freezer. Once the dish was frozen solid, I pulled it out of the pan and sealed it up. When I'm ready to cook it, I'll just peel out of the wrap and place it back in the pan. This way I can still use my pan rather than letting it sit unused in a deep freeze. Even better, I have a great meal, ready in just the time it takes to bake. Yum!

Hello friends, I doubled the sauce as recommended by countless other reviewers, but in retrospect I wish I had halved the pasta and cheese section instead, because we have sooo much food left over. If you are having a dinner party for 4 (like I was) definitely leave the sauce measurements alone and cut back on the pasta and cheese. In an 8" x 8" glass dish, use 3 sheets of the square pre-cooked pasta, with generous servings of sauce and cheese. This size dish yields very generous servings for four people. You may even have a little left over for tomorrow's lunch.

I didn't think this was as good as the reviews suggested it would be. I did not double the sauce and the next time I would definitely do that. I used fresh lasagna noodles and I think they were thicker than a dried noodle would be so it was a bit noodly especially on the bottom layer. I would up the amount of Italian sausage next time and probably add more garlic as well. All in all a good lasagna but not an amazing one.

Thanks to everyone who rated this receipe. It was really easy to make, the only thing I would do is to either cut out the brown sugar or cut the carrots in half as the lasagna was too sweet for me. Generally the flavor was wonderful and people at the dinner party had seconds so that was great!

As all have said, double the sauce. And, don't cook the lasagna noodles! Just layer the uncooked noodles and they will cook beautifully in the sauce. Saves time, a dirty pot, strainer and dealing with slippery noodles. Very good.

My quest for an exceptional lasagna recipe is over! Excellent. Raves from dinner guests tonight. Double sauce -- a must. Used no bake lasagna noodles -- will use regular lasagna noodles next time.

A filling, delicious meal!!

I have made this recipe several times and I always hear 'this is the best lasagna I have ever had' from whoever tries it. I doubled the sauce and substituted mushrooms for carrots. I also added a splash of red wine to the sauce while it simmers. I think it is best if the sauce is made the day before-it gives the flavors a chance to blend as well as dividing the labor in half. I have also used regular breakfast sausage in the meat sauce and it was great. This was by mistake-I guess I just wasn't thinking straight. Overall a great recipe and quite easy to make, just takes a bit of time.

Best lasagna I've ever made or eaten. Followed recipe, sauce is just right if you measure out in 1/2 cup increments, but didn't bother boiling noodles. Don't like to deal with those slippery eels!

I have tried several lasagna recipes, and for those like me who like a more rich lasagna, this one is sure to please. It has the wonderful flavour of the sausage without the greasy texture which other salsas often have when pork meat is added. I was hesitant at first to add the spinach ricotta layer as it seemed more appropriate in a lighter lasagna but it was wonderful. One of those dishes where it does not seem too heavy as your eating it...definetely will take seconds on this one! As others said, double to salsa recipe, double quantity is perfect. I used two small containers of ricotta which was more than enough. This was roughly half the amount the recipe called for. Also simmered the meats with a glass of red wine until evaporated and added a fair amount of crushed red pepper to the salsa. This was a large lasagna. My partner and I mealed two portions each last night and the other part is in the freezer. It won't be in there long though! This is a great lasagna.

I prepared this recipe for myself and a few family members. EVERYONE went for seconds! I did as many others had and doubled the sauce part; also, being the native Louisianian that I am, had to add my Creole seasoning (in addition to the other seasonings)to the sauce. The preparation did take some time, but I did cut it down some by using Barilla no-boil lasagna. I would probably make this dish again, but only for a special occasion.

Didn't seem too difficult for a homemade lasagne, and it was delicious. Didn't read the advice to double the sauce till after I made it, but I thought it was great as directed (although I did put in a tablespoon of chili flakes rather than 1/2 teaspoon--it had a great bite!)

This lasagna not only tastes great....it looks great! The spinach, tomatoes and little pieces of carrot make for a colorful presentation. I didn't have ricotta so used a large cottage cheese, slightly drained. I also added some salt to the sauce....about 1 tsp. Next time I prepare it, I'll invite someone over...for sure!

For those of you who find that this recipe is too bland, try a different sausage. I am fortunate to live in Denver where the absolute BEST Italian sausage is made (Canino's Sausage). I've lived all over the country and have never found anything better. If you can't find decent sausage, just add a little lightly crushed fennel seed. That makes a big difference.

I did like the little kick that the red pepper flakes gave to this lasagne. I also used Muer Glen crushed tomatoes and paste and it tasted very fresh.

I set out out make two trays of lasagna over the last few days (one for mom-in-law). I quadrupled the sauce in light of everyone's suggestion to double the sauce for 1 tray (used 2 pounds each of beef and Italian sausage). The reviewers were absolutely right. I used a normal amount of sauce in assembling both lasagnas and ended up with a few small freezer bags of leftover sauce -perfect for pasta down the road. The recipe, as written, would not have produced enough sauce. The only deviations I made (besides a little extra sausage) was to add extra crushed tomatoes, about 1 cup of white wine, and to briefly pulse the beef/sausage mixture in my food processor. I couldn't seem to get the sausage to break up well and didn't want big chunks of sausage in the lasagna. Probably a "picky" step on my part - would be fine if I was just making pasta sauce. This recipe is just fantastic - I assembled and baked last night and couldn't resist taking a few bites after it sat for an hour or so - YUM. I would not reduce the ricotta at all (as someone mentioned) as I think it's perfect. Bon Appetite!

To Cook on 3/15. Wouldn't it be easier to just buy the right pan?! Make it a few times, and you'll spend as much $ on foil as you would for a new pan. Besides, most people have problems with leaky lasagna because they put in too much liquid. I say use less sauce in construction, and serve some on the side. "Works for me!"

this is a great recipe - def double the sauce. a trick i use since i also only have a 9 by 13 pan: wrap the whole bottom of the pan in tin foil, with lots of extra up around the sides. then build it up using the tin foil as extra wall, fold it over the top, and when you are ready to brown the top just cut down the middle of the foil with sheers. by then the lasagna is cooked enough that the layers stay together by themsleves, and anything that leaks does so down inside between the foil and the pan. works for me!

Nice flavor but as others noted, somewhat dry. I used an 11x15 baking dish and it worked great as a single dish. You really must double the sauce, use it generously and thin it a little with water so the finished product is not as dry. I used precooked lasagna and would not use it again because the noodles curled when I was assembling the layers and made the process more difficult.

This is by far the best lasagna I have ever made and gets rave reviews.

For this new smoked recipe, I would substitute carrots instead of celery as in this Three Cheese recipe. Enjoy

Fabulous. It's delicious and slices right out of the pan. Next time, I will: 1) use a DEEPER pan, 2) double the sauce and save what I don't need, 3) maybe add some chopped sun-dried tomatoes to sauce at the end of the simmering.

SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD. a classic lasagna and sauce, carrots and all. I omitted the beef, but added more sausage. very pleased.

Loved the recipe but it is way too deep for a regular 9X13 pan. I was going to buy a lasagna pan and didn't have time so I used a reg glass 9X13 bakinng dish and it was way too shallow! I wish I would've known, there wasn't enough room for all the layers. Also as others said, definitely double the sauce, it needs it.

This was a great dish. I also doubled the canned tomatoes to make more sauce. I roughly chopped fresh spinach and added to the ricotta mix instead of frozen spinach, and used no bake noodles. I had rave reviews from all 10 who ate it.

Luscious! As everyone says, double the sauce! I replaced the ground beef & hot sausage with sweet Italian sausage, omitted the paste, sugar & red pepper- and it was still AMAZING! For ease, just use the noodles dry. This may sound crazy, but you honestly will not be able to tell the difference. Of course, you will notice that you have more time to read epicurious....

I have made this 3 times, and I really love it. I doubled the sauce and cut the ricotta mixture in half for the past 2 times. The last time I used no bake noodles. I can't tell the difference and it cuts my time and effort. Definitely a must-make lasagne.

This was a fabulous recipe. I was looking for a lasagna dish that wasn't too difficult to make and I found it in this one. I ommited a few things, like the carrots (in lasagna? Gross!) and the italian sausage, but it was still great. I'm making it again for my boyfriend this week!

I loved the sauce from this recipie, I would definately make the sauce again to go with spaghetti. But as the lasagna, I like the "Sausage, cheese & Basil" Recipie better.

I think this is my first 4-fork rating. The lasagna was impossibly delicious...very rich tasting so I ate it with a side of guilt, but it was well worth it. I can't remember if I doubled the sauce or not...likely not...and it turned out jsut right. I particularly liked the spinach-egg concoction. I'm making it again this weekend for some friends. It's making my stomach growl just thinking about it.

Rating: 3
This was a great success! With the suggestion of others I also doubled the sauce and had a little left over to freeze for another day. I would advise to place some sort of cookie sheet under the pan as mine overflowed a bit. I also tried it with the no-boil noodles. That was all right, a little bit too dry, even with the added amount of liquid, I will use the "boil" kind next time. One change I did, was to cook my beef and sausage before adding it into the sauce. This cuts down on the grease in the sauce! Otherwise, a great recipe!

Rating: 2
Hmm, well at the risk of having cyber-tomatoes thrown my way from all the reviewers that love this recipe, I have to say this sauce tastes just like something one might get out of a jar -- and a bargain-store jar at that. I'm hoping that when I make and bake the lasagna tomorrow that it will all come together, but the sauce (which I've just finished making for tomorrow) just doesn't cut it. I'll probably go back to using my old bolognese recipe as I find that more flavorful and authentic.

This was truly the best lasagna I have ever made. I come from an Italian family that know their sauces and they raved about this one. I would recommend doubling the sauce, so you can have extra for those extra sauce lovers.

This is a really good recipe. I doubled the sauce and it was just the right amount. The spicy sausage contrasts nicely with the sweet sauce.

After reading the PAGES of reviews, I had to make it. As recommended, I doubled the sauce, added some red wine, more hot pepper flakes, and lots of garlic. I made it the day before and refrigerated it overnight. However, it took much longer than the 80 mins. to bake. I made it for a pot-luck supper and it was devoured to the last drop of sauce. Definitely a make-again recipe.

This is a great recipe definitely worth the time. I substituted ground turkey, added more basil, red pepper, salt, and pepper. When I make this again I will add more crushed tomatoes to make the sauce go a little farther.

The sauce was great, although I would add a smaller can of tomatoes, because I had ran out of the sauce towards the end. I would liberally salt and peper the ricotta mixture. Also the sauce, the spinach adds nice color to an already great recipe.

I substituted 1 lb. of pork/veal/beef mixture for the ground feef and sausage. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! You could kick up the spice if you like it zippy. Also - unlike other lasagnas that are better the next day, this was delicious and firm right out of the oven! (Maybe because of the meat substitution?).

This did not turn out as well as I had hoped. I did double the sauce based on other reviews. Just didn't have much flavor and the sauce seemed thin. I've definitely made better lasagna.

I've been making this for years, and needed to make a vegetarian lasagna recently, but couldn't find the perfect recipe. I ended up using this recipe, and added 1 pound sauteed mushrooms and 1 can diced tomatoes to the finished sauce. It came out great.

This was my first real dish I ever made and it turned out delicious. I even gave some to my very discerning Italian American friend who said it was "Amazing". I did give it 4 forks for how the dish came out, but of course, as everyone knows, doubling the sauce makes your life much easier. As I was spooning the mixture for the final layer, I was practically scraping the saucepan to get enough sauce to cover the dish (and I had already added some extra tomato paste hoping it would make up for NOT doubling the sauce). But despite that, still delicious. As a new cook, it took me about 2 hours to make the dish (the night before). But for experienced cooks, I'm sure it'll be a lot less time to make. I then baked it the night I served it. It was totally worth the time and energy.

Rating: 3
We used ground lamb instead of beef and substituted maple syrup (hey, it's springtime in the northeast) for the brown sugar. Also forgot to put the eggs in the ricotta mixture, but I couldn't taste a difference. Used sausage patties rather than links, which broke up nicely and mixed in well with the other ingredients in the sauce. Got rave reviews from the family. Didn't double the sauce and it turned out fine...plated well, too, pieces held together and stood up nicely w/o falling apart. Carrots and syrup give a nice sweetness to balance all the salt in the cheese and sausage.

My boyfriend made this for my birthday party and it was wonderful. We agree that doubling the sauce recipe would be a good idea.

This lasagna was delicious. My husband and I don't like a lot of sauce - I made it as directed and it turned out perfect. You can cut perfect squares and they stay together instead of falling apart on the plate. One recommendation: use larger than a 9x13 pan. I found that a 9x13 wasn't large enough for the amount of ingrediants that the recipe called for.

I made this years ago when the recipe was first printed and, as everyone agreed, there was not enough sauce. But when I made extra sauce, the lasagna came out fabulous. The ricotta mixture makes an excellent filling for stuffed manicotti. Yum!

Oh my gosh!! This was my first lasagna and NO one could believe that I made it (thought it was from an Italian restaurant). I went with the general consensus and DOUBLED the sauce; I don't see how there would be enough sauce other wise. I added mushrooms to the saut and also added wine after browning the meats and reduced it before adding remaining ingredients. This makes a ton of lasagna; I had to freeze some (though it didn't last long once our friends found out I had some left!) THIS IS COOKING!! My fiance and about 1/2 of the Sacramento agree (seems like everyone wanted a slice)!!

Very substantial and hearty dish that doesn't taste nearly as heavy as the dish itself! I totally agree in doubling the sauce recipe - it needs much more than called for. Also the no-cook noodles work great with this recipe. The red pepper flakes add a nice pizazz to the dish. Though enhancing the sauce could be good, the sauce is excellent in its own right.

Rating: 3
this is a truly wonderful receipe - i would have given it 4 forks but having to adjust the receipe makes it a 3 - the sauce needs to be DOUBLED and have extra cheese on hand - i served this for a friend's birthday dinner and everyone LOVED IT - i did add about a cup of red wine to the sauce and about 6 ounces of sliced mushrooms to give it more body, that and i love mushrooms in my sauce - when the sauce was doubled, there is enough left over to serve over a couple of servings of pasta - this one is a keeper -

Yummy! This was my first lasagna and it turned out great. I also doubled the sauce as previously suggested and used ground turkey in place of the beef & cottage cheese in place of the ricotta (not a fan). Used a bit more spicy sausage & red pepper. I added red wine to the meat just after browning, then reduced it & added the remaining ingredients. I did have to use 2 pans to accommodate all the sauce but it was worth it. Next time I'll add some sauted mushrooms to the filling. Overall, a great success!

After being totally overwhelmed by the reviews, I tackled this one (with the help of the Lord!)and this is what I did. I increased some of the ingredients as per the other cooks; 1 1/2 c onion, 1 cup carrots, 3 TB garlic, 8 ounces ground turkey(instead of beef), 3 Jenny o sweet turkey sausage (and added some red pepper flakes at the end of cooking to control the spiciness), 2 cans of 28 oz Contadina crushed tomatoes with roasted garlic,(Tomatoe paste stayed same except I added 1/2 C water) 1/2 cup fresh basil, 1 1/2 TB oregano, 2 bay leaves. Since Mozzarella comes in 1 lb package, I left it at 1 lb.(Instead of putting it on the top , I used extra parmesan) I couldn't imagine not adding that extra tomatoes as I had just the right amount of sauce for one pan. I also added a little garlic powder to the cheese mixture. Next time I'll try sundried tomatoes for an extra kick.

Rating: 3
Definitely will make again. Doubled the sauce as others suggest and had plenty for the lasagna and still enough for another meal. Next time for the sauce, I'll use half the brown sugar and just a bit less tomato paste since the sauce was a bit too thick. My husband, who claims he's a lasagne connisseur, says it's one of the best he's ever had.

I made this last night and it was wonderful. Very flavourful. I did double the sauce recipe and was glad I did. The only problem I had was my lasagna pan (not a true lasagna pan - just a 13 x 9 pan) was not big enough. I had to split the recipe and bake it in two separate pans. I'll go out and buy a proper lasagna pan now as I will definitely be making this again. It didn't dry out at all (probably from doubling the sauce recipe). My whole family loved it. I didn't have a good lasagna recipe, now I do.

This was an almost-perfect recipe!!! I made it about 8 months ago & I took tips from others who made it before me & i DOUBLED THE SAUCE up front & had PLENTY of cheese on hand-to make sure I could really use my sauce & cheese abundantly. I played around the sauce a bit because I like my sauce on the semi-sweet side--atlthough it has to have some kick to it. Great recipe, though. One of the best recipes I've come across

This recipe is pretty fool-proof as far as lasagna is concerned. I really liked the sauce even though preparation was time consuming. But when I tried it out of the oven, I really don't know if a bottled pasta sauce would have tasted that vastly different. To the cook from El Paso: At what point would you add the red wine? That might set the dish a part a little!

I don't know when a recipe has sparked so much controversy since the argument of who actually created the Margarita! All things aside, this is a wonderful recipe. Who cares if its Italian or American...it's just plain delicious. Agree with the other reviewers on doubling the sauce. I also added a healthy dose of dry red wine. That definately kicks it up with more flavor, as the alcohol in the wine releases certain fat and flavor molecules that won't be released without the help of alcohol. Learned that from a recent issue of Fine Cooking magazine. I've got a batch of the sauce on the stove as we speak. YUM!

i used bottled pasta sauce instead of making from scratch and added some garlic to the ricotta mixture and it turned out well. everyone raved about it and there were NO leftovers...and i made 2 pans....even my husband raved (and he's one tough critic)...i did make it one day in advance and added extra mozzarella. well worth the effort, this is a crowd pleaser!

I don't think this recipe was all that great. The 3 to 4 cups of grated carrots was a little too much and really overpowered the dish.

Since this website is about reviewing RECIPES....not other commentators....my feeling is that this Lasagna is nice, but not particularly noteworthy. It is the type of lasagna you would have at a PotLuck, which is often good, but not extraordinary. Sauce is VERY chunky, making it hard to spread between layers, but after baking, everything will merge wonderfully in this good (not great) comfort food.

Rating: 0
I've never made this lasagna, but felt compelled to comment. Seems like much of the argument stems from the misuse and misunderstanding of the word "traditional." The idea of "traditional Italian" alone is a joke - regional cuisines throughout Italy are highly diverse. And what about "traditional American?" No such thing. "Traditions" are subjective, dynamic, and often pay little attention to such abstract concepts as geo-political boundries, etc. Also, we're clearly discussing matters of personal taste and opinion here, so why do so many people see this issue as "either/or," and "black/white?"

Rating: 0
They say you shouldn't discuss politics or religion in social settings. Maybe recipes should be included in that list. I'm amused that humanity still manages to exist, if something as trivial as a recipe for Three-Cheese Lasagna with Italian Sausage, Salted Water for Boiling or Double Chocolate Layer Cake can arouse such vitriolic intolerance. On the other hand, maybe things are so peaceful and dull that people need to find something to bitch about.

No identity crisis here mister. My entry is still intact, heres a recap. Educate? He started off his review with an insult and came off somewhat pompous throughout. The originating review in question deserved this kind of retort??? too much testosterone dude. ANYWAY :) We just ate this tonight for dinner and it was EXCELLENT. Im in Sweden at the moment and could not locate ricotta so I used cottage cheese instead. I doubled the sauce and upped the crushed pepper to 1.5T. mmm mmm good. Interestingly enough swedes use this 'wafer' like lasagna as well. It tasted the same, I overlapped like we americans do and it tasted the same, just thinner. Boyfriend is purring now on the couch haha he lovvved it. Looks like Swedes like this lasagna too so it sounds like an international winner if you ask me. Im glad its not traditional italian. I think its better. Strong flavor and lots of meaty sauce its just too good.

This recipe doesn't claim that it's authentic Italian. Thank you for "educating" us, but most of us already know that there's the American-style lasagne with gobs of mozzarella and ricotta, and the Italian version with bechamel and bolognese sauces. I like both, and I happen to make the American version more often because it's faster, not because I'm ignorant.

Thank you 9/30 cook for trying to educate American sauce eaters on real lasagne! If the rest of you would like a wonderful lasagne recipe and an education on Italian cooking, check out Marcella Hazan's Essentials of Classic Italian cooking. This is to Italian cooking what Pepin's La Technique is for French cooking. Ann Arbor: it appears that the cook on 9/30 was replying to the personal attack on their comment, not "dissing" everyone as you so eloquently put it. Seems to me you are the one attacking. And by the way, homemade noodles ARE better for lasagne!

Loved it. "traditional" american or italian was never specified. Maybe traditional just means meat instead of entirely veggie which is in vogue right now. While my italian grandmother used bechamel sauce instead of ricotta, she also had one hell of a spicy, well-herbed sauce. Anything "Traditional Italian" varies a whole lot region to region. Travel a little and find that out for yourself.

I cannot say how happy I am with this lasagna recipe. My lasagna often, for some reason, turns out sort of flat (not nearly as "fluffy" as restaurant lasagna).

YOU MUST DOUBLE THE SAUCE!! When I made this the first time, I thought I would just follow the recipe and ignore the reviews. But, you really do need to double the sauce. It does not make enough to even put it between all the layers as the recipe requires. You also definitely need the deep pan. This recipe was more flavorful served as leftovers.

This is a very hearty and flavorful dish. I found it a bit on the dry side, though I did add about 1/2 cup of red wine to the sauce. I'll add more liquid to it next time. Also - I had to use dried basil and it was a bit too "basily" for me. My kids really liked it though - so it's a keeper!

If you're going to go to the trouble of making lasagna, I would definitely recommend this recipe. It took up the better part of my day to throw together, but it was worth it-- the house smells so good while it's baking. I took the others' advice and doubled the sauce, including the meat; lasagna would have been far too dry if made as written. And since I'm not the biggest ricotta fan, I used only one tub, which seemed like enough. I added two cloves of garlic to the ricotta/spinach mixture to up what I find to be flavorless cheese. Lastly, I baked this in a 10x15 inch pan. If you double the sauce, there's probably no way to fit everything in a significantly smaller dish. Don't be too impatient to dig in once out of the oven; the resting period seemed crucial to getting the lasagna to firm up nicely.

I also used turkey italian sausage, very lean meat, and part-skim cheeses. It was VERY good, and very cheesy (though I too used only one tub of ricotta). I doubled the sauce, which is definitely necessary. It was fabulous, but not too heavy.

I have made this several times now and always had rave reviews. I've even made extra and frozen them to eat at another time with great results.

I really modified the recipe. I used turkey hot italian sausage and ground sirloin to cut the calories, I didn't have any lasagne so I made manacotti and I added basil, minced garlic, onions & hot pepper to the filling - and I only made 7 - so I had plenty of sauce. Bottom line - it's the sauce of my dreams but next time - a little less sugar, a little more crushed pepper.

The only change I made was the ricotta cheese. I used half the ricotta and it was still plenty creamy! I'm so pleased to have found this recipe.

this is a DELICIOUS recipe! i made this lasagna this past weekend for my mother's birthday and all of the families loved it. i even overheard my father-in-law say that it was very tasty and had a "kick" because of the spicy sausage! even my mother-in-law commented that it was very good (a plus!).......... as for changes, i doubled the sauce as suggested (including the meat), added more of the spices to taste, and also added garlic powder and lawry's seasoning. i also added approximately 2 cups each of mushrooms and chopped roasted red bell peppers (my mom's favorite) and i think the peppers added a great flavor! i will definitely make this again for special occasions! everyone should try this one!

I have made this lasagna twice with very good results each time. Guests loved it, and leftovers don't last long. Looking at other reviews, I agree that more sauce would be helpful, I barely had enough each time I've made the recipe. Also, the ingredients nearly overflow from my 11 x 9 pan! I might try this in a slightly larger baking dish next time. This will now be my standard lasagna until I feel adventureous enough to try another recipe.

I made the sauce for this lasagna the day before and then found it was too thick the next day. So I added a full jar of simple store bought sauce, and this made the sauce easier to use. Also, if I hadn't done that, there would not have been enough sauce. With this modification, the lasagna came out fantastic. Also, I agree that letting it stand for longer is a good idea. I let it stand 30 minutes instead of 15. Great recipe.

This was great basic lasagna recipe. I, too, doubled the sauce. Whenever I make any kind of red sauce I make a ton so I can freeze some for later. It was great over homemade cheese tortellini's later that week. Back to the recipe. I made 2 slight changes. I blended shredded/chopped fresh basil in with the ricotta cheese and I used no boil noodles. Since I used the no boil noodles I increased the amount of sauce I used by at least 2 cups. This avoided the dried out texture you can get when you use that type of noodle. I also agree with a previous post- It best to let the lasagna rest for at least 15 minutes. It is much easier to cut that way and you don't have it sliding all over the place!

This has become one of my standard dinner-party dishes. I've served it on numerous occasions to rave reviews. The only suggestion I would add is to definitely make the lasagne ahead of time and allow it to "rest" before baking. This will reduce the tendency to be sloppy when serving and give you a nicer presentation.

This is an excellent recipe. A wonderful, rich lasagna. I used spicy sausage, which enhanced the flavor. I doubled the sauce, but still too dry, especially when reheating.

Made this as a side dish for Easter. Everyone loved it. It was really delicious. I doubled the sauce (which is very meaty and thick) and used plenty in the lasagna (I used no cook noodles). Froze the remaining sauce for spaghetti. I highly recommend this receipe.

I haven't made lasagna for years, so when I saw this recipe, I thought I'd try it. Wow it was great. I did follow some of the reviewers ideas, I also made the sauce the night before and used anise seed and fennel seed with some extra Itailan seasonings, I find that the sauce is always better the next day. I also used whole milk ricotta cheese. A person must use a bigger pan, I used a an aluminum deep dish pan with a cookie sheet underneath to catch any overflows. With a salad, garlic toast, and a great bottle of red, this recipe makes a memorable dinner.

This lasagna is delicious and beautiful! Doubling the sauce is a must; it comes out to just enough when doubled. Also, a typical 13x9x2 dish will not be deep enough, even if you try to squish! I made a foil tent around the top of the dish to add height and that worked fine. Remember to season with salt and pepper-it was a bit too sweet for my liking (also, maybe use a little less brown sugar). I used extra spicy Italian sausage, and also added extra dried red pepper. Didn't use the carrots, still very good.

Outstanding recipe. I made this for my wife and our friends for valentine's day and everyone loved it. I followed the suggestions about doulbing the sauce and using whole-milk ricotta and it was superb. You will need a large dish in which to cook this. I used a DEEP 9x13 stoneware and it was FULL.

Would make a few changes- 1) add more meat sauce (or don't use the entire cheese fillings) 2) make sure you buy real hot italian sausage.. most (even at supermarkets) are really only mild.. 3) you do not need to bake this for that long- can do 40 min- half with foil covered/half without..

Rating: 3
This is my (and my family's) favorite lasagna recipe. But I do agree with a couple of points other reviewers have made. I have a few suggestions that make this the "perfect lasagna recipe." First of all, double the amount of sauce - this takes care of the "dryness" problem some other reviewers mentioned. Second of all, don't use the "no-boil" lasagna noodles. They absorb too much of the sauce. It's worth it to use the old fashioned boil-first noodles. The recipe does say to "season with salt & pepper." Don't forget this step - it makes a big difference. Finally, use whole milk ricotta. It's worth it!

Rating: 2
It's difficult not to sit on the fence with this review. On one hand I feel it's a very hearty and satisfying recipe but on the other hand I felt it was too dry and bland. I would definitely make more sauce next time and add a spicier sausage. Would also consider another reviewers advice and use whole milk ricotta for more flavor. There are better recipes out there.

I've recently taken up cooking, and since this was my first attempt at lasagna I decided to go all out. It was so inexplicably fabulous that I had to post something. I used the sauce from this recipie with a tbsp extra brown sugar and a dash more pepper. I also added chopped fennel because I had some left over from a salad, and used sweet sausage rather than spicy, good choice I think. Substituted smoked gouda for mozzarella in layers and added eggplant, and portabella. Meant to add spinach and artichoke hearts to top layer but forgot. Topped with mozzarella, fresh basil and crumbled feta. And parm. Absolutely divine! Next time I'm adding kalamata olives in with eggplant layer and topping with provolone. I mixed recipies and accidently used half as much ricotta mix(with fresh rosemary and a shallot) as I should have, but the gouda made up for it. Sauce amt. was perfect for dish, but would have liked leftovers! Extremely rich, and not for the lactose-intolerent or indulgence concious. However, I think my fiance is rushing out to buy me diamonds tomorrow.

I have searched and searched for a great pasta recipe and I truly feel this is it! The rating should really be 3.5 forks. I switched the amount of hamburger and sausage to give the meat sauce more zing and added a 15 oz can of Contadina tomato sauce. I also added in more basil. Fresh basil is a must in this recipe. Also, I generally don't care much for Ricotta cheese but using whole-milk ricotta (if you aren't fat conscious) improves the taste dramatically. I also added replaced 1/4 C Parmesan cheese with Romano cheese. This lasagna reheats great as leftovers. In addition, the remaining sauce was wonderful over some spaghetti.

I expected a lot more from this recipe. I would definitly recommend doubling the sauce recipe but leaving the meat portion as is. It wasn' t dry but really needed more sauce. My daughter did not care for it and my son refused to eat it. I thought it was pretty typical lasagna and a bit on the bland side. I used sweet italian sausage because of my kids but I would definitly use the spicy if I made this again which I probably won't do. I did omit the onions which may of lent to some of the blandness. That was the only change I made to this recipe. It isn't bad but it just isn't great.

This is an excellent recipe for a very traditional lasagna. My family loved it; the leftovers were gobbled up. Because of what others said, I doubled the amount of tomatoes in the sauce and used most of it up. I also cut the fat a bit by using turkey sausage and half low fat ricotte and half non-fat ricotta. It was still great. You could probably tweak the fat content up or down depending upon the ocassion.

I made this for guests and they cleaned their plates. I cut back on the fat content by using low fat cottage cheese for half the ricotta and egg beaters instead of eggs. I also used turkey sausage. I used fresh spinach since I didn't have frozen, and, I steamed it first. I also used 1 jar of Newman's Marinara and 1 can of crushed tomatoes. It came out really good!

ALL good lasagnas are labor intensive and expensive to make. This one is VERY good in spite of being incredibly fattening. I added some extra tomato sauce to the sauce recipe and used the carrots. (No guts, no glory, right?) I also accidentally omitted the eggs from the ricotta. It made no discernable difference and inadvertently saved some fat and calories. Everyone gave this rave reviews. A "special occasion" dish, for sure.

I made this dish for a work potluck and was worshipped ever since. One Italian woman I worked with told me that I "just had to try that lasagna on the table, it's one of the best I've ever had." That was BEFORE she knew I brought it. It did take quite a bit of time to prepare but was well worth it. Doubling the sauce was definitely necessary.

Wonderful! Even my husband, an accomplished chef who is very hard to impress, loved it. I made it according to the recipe with the exception of using sweet rather than hot Italian sausage (I have small kids with tender taste buds) and seasoning the sauce to taste as well as the Ricotta mixture. It was just great. It sets up beautifully, making for a lovely presentation. I didn't find it dry, as some of the reviewers mentioned. I especially like the way the spinach balances the abundance of oregano.

I did not think this lasagne was that great. My family ate it but it certainly was not the best lasagna we have ever had. I took some of the other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and added an extra 15 oz. can of tomatoes. While I agreed that doubling the sauce was necessary, I think the extra can of tomatoes wasn't. Has anyone tried the sausage, cheese and basil lasagna from this website? I wonder how the two compare. The best lasagna is at PappaMia's in Houston, TX. Nothing else comes close. That is a recipe I wish I had.

Came out great, thanks to taking into consideration everybody's reviews. Used mushrooms in place of the carrots. I added a small 8-oz.can of tomato sauce and about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of water which I used to clean out the paste and crushed tomato cans. It still held its shape but wasn't dry. I did not add the brown sugar. I used my 10x14 inch lasagna pan and it needed every bit of that space.

Of the many different lasagna recipes I have made, this one BEATS ALL hands down! Each time I create this masterpiece, it draws rave reviews from those who are lucky enough to enjoy it. I usually like to serve this with the mixed antipasto recipe, also found in the epicurious file. Recently made this for my wife, who sold it at silent auction at her elementary school. Thought it deserved more than the $16 bucks it received, though. One suggestion - I always add one 15 oz can of tomatos. Without the extra tomatos, its a trite dry.

Wonderful lasagna recipe with a nice kick of italian sausage. I used fresh pasta (so I didn't need to boil) and I thought the sauce was flavorful and far better than any jar brand.

This Lasagna was stupendous! I will throw away all my other recipes. The sauce was wonderful but because of all the comments, I did double the sauce so I had plenty and didn't have to scrimp. In fact I had some leftover for spaghetti the next day. After the dish was assembled, I wrapped it in foil and froze it because I needed it for a party the following week. It defrosted beautifully and cooked the same amount of time. It is very tasty, with just the right amount of everything. I would even give it a 5 rating!

This is a fabulous recipe. The best lasagna I ever made. Takes a little time but well worth it. My Italian husband agrees and I make it often.

Great for dinner party. I've used it repeatedly with success/raves. Use half the spinich and only combine it on one 1/2 of your pan (so the kids and non-spinich lovers don't gross out). Don't use all the ricotta they say and don't overfill your pan.

This is excellent. The sauce has a perfect consistency and is very flavorful. Instead of Italian sausage, I used about 1/2 a pound of Bob Evan's Savory Sage Sausage. Even the first piece of lasagna came out of the pan easily and without falling apart. I've finally found the perfect recipe.

I have made this twice now and it was absolutely perfect both times. One word of warning - be sure you use a deep lasagna pan - it puffs up as it bakes. The flavors are marvelous.

It makes a very impressive presentation in a nice Italian painted ceramic pan. the best lasagna ever!

Good, but on the heavy side. I would cut down on the amount of sausage/ground beef next time.

A great lasagna... I left out the sugar, used oven-ready noodles, substituted mushrooms for carrots, and increased the amount of sauce (based on other reviewers comments). Time consuming, but worth the effort.

Excellent! I was in a hurry when I made this... so I took note from past reviews that the sauce could use a little extra something to keep from becoming "dry". I put baby carrots & onion in my food processor and had much more (almost double) what the recipe called for but threw it in, knowing that the water from the vegetables would be needed in the sauce. AND (since I was in a hurry) I used a 7 oz. bag of fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen 10 oz. pkg. and I used the lasagna noodles that do not require boiling. Due to these changes, I did not need to add any extra tomatoes. This recipe will be added to me "keepers"!!!

I added another container of chopped tomatoes. After the sauce reduced, there was just enough. The fresh basil is really worth using-- it added great flavor to the recipe. By mistake, I mixed the mozzarella with the ricotta and parmesan in the Cuisinart. It may have been my imagination, but the dish seemed much lighter as a result. There were sixteen strips of lasagna noodles in the pound package, so I was able to make three layers with six strips in each layer. You may want to leave the brown sugar out of the sauce -- it comes out a little too sweet for my taste.

Rating: 3
This dish was very good however I think I would've liked it better had I made a "full fat" version. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage; 4% fat ground meat; part skim mozzarella and ricotta and organic crushed tomatoes and no-boil lasagna noodles. I didn't measure the onions or carrots. The sauce was a little skimpy but I was able stretch it throughout the layers. I liked this recipe especially because it was easy to serve and didn't drip all over the plate or pan. It was very tasty and I'll definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe! The sauce takes a long time to prepare, so I made it the night before I needed to bake the lasagna. I added mushrooms to the sauce.

THIS LASAGNA WAS TO DIE FOR!!! THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER MADE LASAGNA, AND I MUST SAY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY RECIPE I WILL BE USING IN THE FUTURE! I DID ALTER A FEW INGREDIENTS, HOWEVER: 1) I OMITTED THE CARROTS. 2) I SIMMERED ONION, 3 CLOVES OF GARLIC & CHOP MEAT W/ BARILLA MARINARA JAR SAUCE. 3) I BAKED 10 LINKS OF SWEET SAUSAGE IN THE OVEN, THEN SLICED THEM UP AND SCATTERED THEM ON TOP OF THE MEATSAUCE LAYER. I ALSO USED BARILLA LASAGNA JAR SAUCE TO SPREAD ON BOTTOM OF PAN, ON TOP OF LASAGNA AND DRIZZLED IN BETWEEN EACH LAYER. IT WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE QUICKER USING THESE JAR SAUCES THAN CREATING THE SAUCE IN THE ORIGINAL RECIPE. IT DID STILL TAKE A WHILE TO MAKE THIS RECIPE, BUT OVER ALL, IT WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY DELICIOUS!!!

A way to a man's heart is a good lasagna...I also used the pre-baked noodles and made this in a 8x8 for two people. Just cut the cheese mixture in half. For some reason, I really didn't end up with extra sauce. I was going to freeze it if I did.

this is a GREAT! lasagna recipe. I use the no boil lasagna noodles this makes it much easier and one less pot to wash. If using the no boil noodles make sure you double the sauce part only on the recipe since the noodles absorb alot of the liquid. I am Italian and have eaten alot of lasagna in my lifetime. As my brother would say this is the best! Don't mess with the lasagna recipe.

Excellent lasagna. I prepared it in a 8x11.5x2 pan. Obviously, I used less noodles, I think 4 per layer. Using this size pan, the amount of sauce was perfect. I only used 3/4 of ricotta mixture. I used mozzarella and provolone in place of just mozzarella. I omitted the spinach and added extra crushed red pepper. If you are serving a crowd who likes it spicy, I would recommend the extra pepper. Maybe even add a little in the ricotta layer. This recipe has a great blending of flavors. This size pan served 6 adults.

This recipe is great, I used italian tomato paste and add a little bechamel in ricotta mix, and was a wonderful dish.

Rating: 3
This is a good basic recipe for lasagna. The noodle layering technique ensures that it won't fall apart at serving time, and the use of sauce rather than oil under the first layer of noodles minimizes noodle slippage when adding the ricotta-spinach mixture. I've made this a few times, and I'd suggest some minor changes. First, I omit the carrots from the sauce. They add an unnecessary foreign flavor to the familiar one of the sauce. Also, the brown sugar is not a necessity. The tomatoes and paste bring enough sweetness to the sauce on their own. As for the ricotta-spinach mixture, I suggest adding one (or more, depending on your preference) clove of garlic that is either put throw a garlic press or mashed in a mortar and pestle. Ricotta and spinach are relatively bland, and the parmesan adds only a minimal amount of flavor.

Rating: 4
I made this for an oldtimer's reunion of 20 people and it was a hit. The tomato sauce needed more substance and kick so I added sliced and steamed zucchini and Cajun Tabasco Peppers with the seeds removed, and tons of freshly ground cummin to that. The ricotta spinach part needed more creaminess and flavor so I made a thick bechamel sauce with a whole freshly ground nutmeg (or almost all so I wouldn't destroy my manicure in the grating) and added that to the spinach part. The balance between the spicy, chunky red sauce and creamy nutmegy white sauce was divine. You can cut the calories by substituting turkey sausage and minced chicken for the meat and non-fat cottage cheese for the ricotta. If the parmesan is salty enough you can use less of that. I also used a jar of Ragu chunky vegetable with garlic and onion instead of the crushed tomatoes. It made the red sauce very substantive. A great company dish served with a mixed salad with balsamic vinegar and oil and crunchy fresh herb bread.(I used all fresh herbs on top of Girard's Lite Champaign Dressing.) The whole menue was a symphony of spicey, creamy, chunky, crisp, crunchy,sweet, hot, and cold.

This was a good lasagna recipe but I expected something more with all the rave reviews. I discovered that there are 2 sizes of lasagna noodles. The smaller ones go widthwise in the pan and would be the 15 called for in the recipe - note the ounces. I used 12 of the standard size (lengthwise in pan) making this a typical lasagna casserole. I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 hot Ital. sausage, 1/2 of the ricotta, and less mozzarella and I added an 8 oz. can of tom. puree. Adjustments were based on other reviews. The additional puree was definitely needed.

I have made this lasagna a number of times for my family and company. Each time have received rave reviews. It is delicious. I try to make extra sauce and freeze for a quick, but, quite tasty pasta dinner.

I have made this recipe many times ... it is great!!!!! Even my picky kids love it. I substitute turkey products for the sausage and the ground meat. It's the best. I'm going to give it to my neighbors for a holiday treat... too much shopping - no time to cook meal.... I think they will love it. Jacquie Ladera Heights, California

This is an exceptional recipe. Recommend preparing the recipe one day before cooking it because the flavors are even better on the second day.

This is excellent! I doubt I'll ever use my old recipe again. I was glad I used the extra 8 oz. tomato sauce (roasted garlic flavor), and I used oven-ready pasta, which was a little bit of a time-saver. I baked mine in a 13 1/2 x 9 5/8 x 2 3/4" aluminum baking pan and I don't see how anyone got theirs into anything smaller!

This lasagna is a winner! I made it with oven ready noodles. Just make sure there is sauce under and over each layer of noodles for necessary moisture to cook noodles. I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, a splash of water and kept the lid on while simmering sauce.

Loved this recipe. I also added an 8oz can of tomato sauce. This helped. Next time I would double the sauce portion. Prepare for a HUGE lasagna!

I don't know what size pan would hold this ... I guess I need to look for a roaster pan or something. I used a 10X14 pan and it was way too small. I agree on the sauce constistency though, adding 8 oz. can of tomatoe sauce is a great idea. I simmered sauce for about 2 hours and had to add water.

I made this for a birthday dinner and it was so good it nearly got more attention than the birthday celebrant! I lot of work, but fun to do and the leftovers froze and reheated very nicely.

What more could I say that has not already been said! Outstanding! I did prepare it a bit differently: I used Chorizo instead of Italian sausages for a different taste. Divided the dish into 2 - 8" casserole dishes and froze one for a fast, easy dinner and I prepared the sauce one day and assembled it the next day. My "very fussy" teenager took leftovers for school the next day (and wouldn't share!!). To me, that says it all. Definately a keeper!!

Outstanding! This is the best! I am Italian and I made it for my family. Everybody wanted the recipe. When I make lasagna, this will be the only recipe I will use.

I made this dish last week, and my husband and I just loved it. He said it was the best lasagna he had ever had. I wish I had made a little extra sauce, but I'll do that next time.

I made two of these lasagnas at the same time. I used wheat pasta in one and rice pasta in the other. My guests gave both lasagnas lots and lots of good compliments. It is great heated up the next day. The only draw back is the fairly long preparation time.

Wonderful! The lasagna was the best I ever made and everyone loved raved over the dish. I used oven ready pasta so I added a half cup of tomato juice. With this extra juice the dish was wonderfuly moist as well as delicious.

My Italian family goes crazy for this lasagna. It isn't much of a time-saver, but it is really terrific. It's also beautiful. I use turkey sausage and it still tastes great.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made it for an informal dinner party. I made only one change to the recipe. I made home-made pasta. This was the first lasagna that I ever made that did not fall apart when I served it.

This was almost professional. The taste and texture were excellent;however,while preparing, I could tell this needed more sauce. I added 8 oz. tomato sauce. The result was great!

This is one of my most-used, tried-and-true recipies from BA-- no other lasagna will do anymore for me and my family!! It is absolutely the best I have ever had and well worth the effort. I must admit, I go for the whole milk ricotta (it's not like you make lasagna everyday!) but otherwise I don't touch a thing in this recipie-- Enjoy!

Perfect for a casual dinner with family or friends!

This is a great recipe, a real keeper. We follow the recipe exactly, as it's just perfect as is. As for not having enough sauce, note the pan size is smaller than the typical "lasagna pan." We made that mistake the first time we made it and were short on sauce, too. Yes, it takes time to make, but it's worth it!

Delicious! Time consuming but worth every minute of it. You'll be satisfied in the end. Definitely will make again.

This is a favorite. The sauce is very good. It serves my 5 children with some left over and they love it. It doesn't taste like a dish made for a crowd.

Face it, making ANY lasagna is a pain in the pan. This one's worth every bit of time and effort you put in it. Sooooooo good. Best lasagna I've ever tasted, hands down.

This recipe is no more time consuming than other lasagna recipes I've tried. I substituted ground turkey and sweet italian (turkey) sausage and the recipe came out great. As always with lasagna - the leftovers tasted even better.

I agree with the comments from Boone, NC fully. I would like to add that I feel that the sauce recipe isn't enough. Next time I make this dish I'll make one and a half times the sauce recipe, I found that I didn't have enough and had to add some jar sauce to finish the recipe. All in all though it was an excellent dish!

Great recipe! When I make lasagna, this is the only way I make it. A lot of work, but worth it! I like to make this recipe when I want leftovers for days.

This is a great lasagna recipe. We love all the cheeses. However, we used mild italian sausage instead and didn't hurt the recipe. We would definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I always make it with a little more sauce.

This rich lasagna is very simple, although somewhat time-consuming to make. It feeds well over 8 people (unless they play pro football) and needs to be baked in a *deep* 13x9" pan. Use the spiciest Italian sausage you can find. The cheeses will blunt the spice a little. It also reheats very well.

This is probably the best lasagne recipe I have tried. I used 8 oz. of italian sausage and increased the cheese a little bit. With a salad and a good crusty bread, it was a big hit with my family.

This is FABULOUS!!!!!Be warned though, it makes a LOT of pasta. If you have it with a salad, there is about enough for 12 people from this one recipe.

This receipe for Lasagna is the BEST. I wouldn't change a thing. The flavors seem to meld together yet have their own unique taste. I highly recommend this dish to lasagna lovers everywhere!

Made it for a crew of friends brave enough to help us move to our new house. It was the first dish served and received rave reviews from everyone. Will be repeated often (but not the move).

I made this recipe for my family over the weekend and they loved it, especially my husband who really doesn't care much for Italian food.

Too much meat and ricotta. Needs more sauce. Otherwise very delicious. Just reduce half of both meat and ricotta, and add more tomato sauce. I'd do it again but with modifications.

Rating: 3
Very good! Sure the basil makes it a little lighter, but you can lighten it up even more by substituting you fave grilled/sauteed veggies for some of the meat. Great either way!

This is one of the best recipes that I have found for lasagne. I don't have to modify it or perk it up - it is incredible the way it is. It's a popular dish for my friends and parents when they are over for dinner. Try it - You'll LOVE it!!

This dish is great to make on a Sunday for leftovers all week. The basil gives the sauce a light, refreshing taste. Freezes well.

I have made this dish 4 times since last summer. It is great. The dish is not thick and heavy like alot of lasagna dishes. Has a fresh taste with the tomatoes and basil.
