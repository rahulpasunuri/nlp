I made this with crab and it was great. I thought this was a nice chowder.

I think the frozen vegetables (frozen onions? seriously?) must be meant to reduce prep time but I can't bring myself to cut quite that many corners, so I used one medium yellow onion, a medium carrot, and 1/2 cup each frozen corn and frozen peas in place of the ingredients called for. I had to cook the chowder a little longer as a result but I think that was a good thing -- it allowed the flavours to meld more and helped the base really thicken. The finished product was wonderful.

I was skeptical about making this and was proven right. You get what you give. Insipid recipe.

Here's my take on this otherwise great recipe. I substituted the two cups milk with one cup manufacturers cream and one cup clam juice (captain brand is best), and fresh diced carrots, onions, celery and cut green beans (much better than frozen). Use equal amount of butter with the flour and make a roux and add after sauteeing the vegetables. Also, if you can find thick cut applewood smoked bacon, I guarrantee you'll be in heaven!!

This was quick and delicious. Here scallops are always sold with the roe sack ("muscle") and it is a shame to through them out. I used them and they were fine. Instead of frozen veg, I chopped two carrots, cut corn off two cobs (raw) and used one cup of fresh spring peas. Added carrrots first then threw in peas and corn at end so they stayed a bit cruncy. So yummy. Doubled the fresh thyme to make it a bit herbier. Big success.

About boiling milk. I brought it to a simmer- just until it was thickened. And, yes, I stirred it while it was getting thick- with a whisk.

I added celery along with onions. Also added fish sauce to taste (about a tsp.) Before serving I added tbsp. of butter, some 1/2 and 1/2 and squirt of hot sauce. Amazing dish! Next time I'm going to try shrimp instead of scallops. Might be better but I don't know how.

Heat the milk up slowly and stir constantly.

How do you boil milk without milk protein separating out?

This was a very simple, but elegant soup, and easy to make. I didn't have thyme or potatoes so used rosemary, 1 1/2 chopped leeks and some chopped mushrooms instead. Very tasty.

I would add some more seasonings. It was just a little bland
