I use this sauce often when I make lamb chops on the grill. It's great.

Easy to make, but came out a little bland on tuna for my tastes. I'd spice it up a little, maybe with hotter mustard and some garlic.

I used this recipe on grilled lamb chops, both as marinade and brush on sauce while grilling. It was very good.

very delicious on tuna steak. make a lot, as it is not as strong when cooked.

VERY GOOD. Fast and easy to prepare. I used it on Chilean sea bass because my market had no quality tuna at the time (Tuna steaks would probably be even better). The recipe reads very strong-tasting, but the mustard flavor is tempered with cooking.
