Queenie: 1 pound of peaches would be understood to be BEFORE they are pitted and peeled. Therefore, 16 oz of puree would be WAY too much.

I had trouble with this recipe. Firstly, I had the same issue with cooking time as some of the other reviewers so I did bake it longer. As far as the actual recipe goes the direction about how many peaches to use in the cheesecake is vague. The recipe says to use two peaches or about a pound of peaches. O.k.... Using the peaches from my own garden I ended up deciding to add 16oz of peach puree to the cheesecake. My guests and I agreed that the texture of the cheesecake was off, that the peaches in the cheesecake didn't really add that much flavor to it and the crust turned out soggy and gross. Next time I will just make a good, old fashioned, plain cheesecake and top with the peaches and balsamic.

I used two peaches and blended them in the food processor with a bit of the mascarpone to blend them well. The balsamic makes this special.

This recipe was delicious. I make a lot of cheesecake but this is the first one I did with mascarpone. The balsamic really adds a wonderful compliment. Don't be afraid of it! I did serve it on the side though just in case some of the less adventurous of my friends only wanted the cheesecake. Easy and delicious.

This recipe was delicious! I wasn't sure about the Balsamic Syrup as it is quite unusual, so I tried the cheesecake on its own. I must say that alone the cheesecake is just ok, however once you garnish it with peaches and the syrup the dessert is transformed from ordinary to extraordinary. It so delicious that it is hard to resist. This is a dish that I would serve at any occasion, from casual to elegant. I brought some of the leftovers to work and everyone was a little skeptical upon hearing the description however they raved about it once they tried it. I even had someone say that it was the best cheesecake they have ever had! The one adjustment that I will do when make it again is that I will change the time that I prebake the crust. The crust was too hard. It wasnt so hard that it affected the eating of the cheesecake or the flavor but it was a flaw, none the less. However, upon sitting overnight the syrup mixed with the crust the crust had a delicious flavor and was not soggy, even at this point it was a little too hard for my liking. This recipe is sure to impress! Oh and I used 2 large peaches and only need to cook the cheesecake for an extra 5 minutes until it was set. Maybe other reviewers were using too much pureed peaches.

We Loved it! I used nectarines instead of peaches and didn't peel them.

First time I made this with 1/3 mascarpone and 2/3 cream cheese, and 1lb of frozen sliced peaches. It definitely wasn't done after an hour, so I baked it for 90 minutes then let it sit in the oven overnight. The cake chilled until about 2pm and was delicious. The second time I made it with the same frozen peaches and 100% mascarpone. Again, after 80 minutes it still wasn't set, but we had to leave for a party. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to chill it either, so it was a little runny, though the taste was still nice. Since some guests at both events weren't sure about the balsamic (which I loved - perfect tart balance to the sweet cake), I left it separate for them to pour on as desired. Might try again with fewer peaches and more time to bake and chill.

Outstanding! This has become a staple dessert in our house. The mascarpone makes it much lighter than most cheesecakes made with cream cheese. The flavor is outstanding. Be sure not to add the balsamic reduction until right before serving.

Easy and quick! Cream cheese works fine. Next time I'd go lighter on the syrup. It makes the crust soggy and doesn't add a whole lot more flavor. Just some.

Here in Italy mascapone cheese is cheaper than cream cheese, so we gave this a try. It took much longer in the oven than the recipe said and was still pretty soft in the middle when we took it out. The taste was a nice light version of cheesecake with just a hint of peach (other than the peaches on top of course). I was not too impressed with the balsamic vinegar. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't totally sure if the flavors went together well. If we try it again I think I may skip the vinegar.

I don't know what went wrong. I used a pound of peaches like it said. Maybe I was only supposed to use 2 peaches? After 1 hour & 35 min. of baking, it was still the consistency of soup. I finally gave up and served it as a custard. The taste was good though.

Although I followed the recommendation of baking it just a little longer, it did not have the creamy consistency that goes along with Marcaspone Cheesecake. I do not recommend this recipe.

Can I rate this one five forks? Yes, it was that good! So easy to make and wow, what a result! I made it for a barbecue and I was beaming ear to ear with all the compliments. I followed the recipe precisely, with the only change being that I used speculaas as graham crackers aren't available here. It needed an additional 20 minutes to bake but it was so simple and so wonderful and a different twist as the marscapone is lighter than cream cheese and melds beautlfully with the peach puree. Dynamite!

This cheesecake was amazing! It was incredibly easy and very delicious! I substituted 2/3 of the mascarpone for light cream cheese (because it's cheaper) and it still turned out phenomenal. The peach flavor was just right and it wasn't too sweet or too rich. I will definately make this again!

Had this last weekend at my brother's house. A really light, not too sweet cheesecake. I look forward to making this for myself.

I made this cheesecake for a dinner party and received rave reviews all around. The mascarpone and peach combine to create a light dessert--perfect for summer. The balsamic syrup adds a sophisticated touch. I have already made this again. Impressive for parties and SO easy to make.

My wife and I loved this recipe. We made it for guests that were coming in from out of town and it received rave reviews! We used graham cracker crumbs instead of actual graham crackers and we let it cook for slightly longer than suggested to ensure that the cheesecake had set up. Fresh peaches were sliced just before serving, and the balsamic glaze was amazing. We will be making this again soon!
