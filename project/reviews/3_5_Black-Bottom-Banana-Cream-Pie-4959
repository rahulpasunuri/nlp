Best. Dessert. Ever. I used chocolate graham cracker cookies instead of chocolate wafers, but I think that made it better. The vanilla pastry cream is especially good and very similar to what my mom used to fill her cream puffs with when I was a kid.

The ganache is AH-MAZING. Not too sweet, just sweet enough, and the texture is to die for. Complemented nicely by the sweetness of the pastry cream. Some reviewers felt the pastry cream was too sweet, but with the semi-sweetness of the ganache I thought it was a perfect pairing. I made a graham cracker crust instead of the chocolate cookie crust called for in the recipe, which added a nice hint of salt that I thought rounded out the other two flavors well. I gave this 3 forks and not 4 for three reasons - the whipped cream, the presentation and the texture of the pastry cream. This DOES NOT need the whipped cream. At all. Definitely serve it ON THE SIDE - do not put it on the pie!!! Both the texture and the extra sweetness of the whipped cream pollute the deliciousness that is this pie, on its own. Other than that, I think this pie looks a little ugly. Next time I would skip the marbling and just leave the extra ganache nicely drizzled across the top and finish with banana slices, to make it look a little more refined. Also, the pastry cream did not set as much as I would have liked. But all in all, my husband freaked over this recipe and I thought it was pretty indulgent. Perfect for a barbeque or fried chicken night!

I took a hint from a previous reviewer and turned this into a 9 x 13 dish (used glass ... the layers are lovely). I also substituted some coconut milk for the real milk in making the pudding part. That's a fun, tropical twist. When I marbled in the ganache, the effect was so pretty that I didn't want to cover it up with cream, so instead, I just served the whipped cream on the side. Considering I made the "pie" in about 1/2 hour (I was in a rush, so didn't do the full 'chill' in between), the taste and look was spectacular! Loved it.

Rave reviews from friends at BBQ! I ended up using some lowfat chocolate cookies from Trader Joes (I was in a hurry, and couldn't make it to another store) Although, I think that helped make it not too sweet. Almost ruined pastry cream! Don't turn your back while cooking it, mine was a little lumpy, but caught it just in time!! I'd definetly make it again.

This was just too sweet to really enjoy. The fresh bananas were completely overwhelmed by all the other flavors. I thought this was a big mushy mess, the rest of my family loved it. I will not make it again.

This recipe was a huge hit! The Vanilla Pastry cream was not my favorite. The next time I make it I am going to leave it exactly the same (I love the chocolate crust and ganache) except substitute the cream from this banana cream pie recipe(which is also to die for): http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/107728

I love to make this for picnics and potlucks: increase the recipe by 50%, and make the whole thing in a 9x13 pan. I'll be honest: I cheat and use packaged vanilla pudding/pie mix instead of the pastry cream. As a result, the whole dessert takes about 20 minutes to prepare. And people seem to love it (my husband requests this dessert all the time - even for his birthday!).

I baked desserts for a local restaurant and this was one of the most requested pies. I made about 8 a week. I substituted a regular crust for the chocolate crust and 2/3 cup chocolate chips for the chocolate in the ganche. This is a hit every time!

I thought this was tasty, but the chocolate crust with the ganache was a little too rich and overpowering for the light vanilla cream. Next time, I will try it with a plain pastry crust, or use milk chocolate for the crust and ganache to lessen the intensity.

This pie is great. Everyone loves it, but it is VERY rich! I also added extra vanilla to the pastry and whipped cream. I've made it several times and now, instead of the cookie crust I use a regular pastry crust (while still keeping the ganach). It makes it less rich and even more fabulous.

Thanks to CNanceJD from Atlanta, GA, I was able to make this pie in one evening, shaving a couple of hours off the required time. I used a double chocolate sandwich cookie crust (24 cookies with 1/4 cup of butter(melted) and ground in the Cuisinart) instead of the crust listed here. I then followed CNanceJD's tips as follows: Chocolate ganache: microwave the cream and butter on medium in 30 second spurts and stir after each heating until it is hot, remove from the microwave and add the vanilla and dissolve in the chocolate. Pastry filling: heat everything except vanilla on high for 1 minute 5 times, whisking it after each minute to keep it smooth. I added an ounce of white chocolate to the pastry filling which I melted in while heating it; I highly recommend trying this. Remove filling from microwave and whisk in vanilla. My own tip - I put the pastry cream into the freezer for one hour, then the fridge for 1 1/2 hours to cut down some time. This pie took a long time, but is super easy and if you plan ahead (which I didn't) it would be a snap to make if done over two nights! I received RAVE reviews and 6 dinner guests ate the whole pie! It is rich but super delicious and impressive to look at, especially when you marbelize the ganache on top. I will make this one again and do over two nights - I want to make it soon! Follow these tips - DEE-LISH!

This turned out so much better than I ever could have expected. People beg me to make it. Excellent!

The ganache should be richer and the vanilla cream lighter. Maybe folding in a couple of egg whites to lighten it up and possibly adding a little liqour (brandy?) to the cream would be nice. There should definely be more contrast between the two layers

I followed the original recipe when I made this last November, and preparation was labor-intensive to say the least. However, the pie disappeared within minutes of setting it out on the table, and people still tell me how good it was almost 9 mos. later. So I would say this recipe is worth the effort.

Thank you, CNanceJD, your microwave instructions worked perfectly. Everyone loved this rich pie, and I'm such a fan I'd live on it if I could!

A delicious pie with a delicious combination of flavors. Took the advice of many reviewers and switched to an oreo crust. Since I didn't find packages of crushed oreo crumbs (and the oreo crumbs for ice cream topping didn't have a recipe on it), I used about 25 cookies and crushed them in the processor with a few tablespoons of butter. It was just fine. Didn't find it time consuming because it was perfect to be done in steps over a couple of days... each step was quick. My family is looking forward to having it often in the future.

This pie is great. Chocolate and bananas really go together. A few modifications to the instructions make preparation a breeze. I made the crust from crumbs of fudge creme filled cookies-I ground up whole cookies (including filling) in a food processor along with a few tablespoons of melted butter to hold the crumbs together; this crust was really easy to make, cuts well and tasted great. You can also use the microwave to speed up making the ganache and pastry filling and to avoid the danger of burning. Chocolate ganache: microwave the cream and butter on medium in 30 second spurts and stir after each heating until it is hot, remove from the microwave and add the vanilla and dissolve in the chocolate. Pastry filling: heat everything except vanilla on high for 1 minute 5 times, whisking it after each minute to keep it smooth. I added an ounce of white chocolate to the pastry filling which I melted in while heating it; I highly recommend trying this. Remove filling from microwave and whisk in vanilla.

Extremely RICH tasting! A very small slice goes a long, long way. Think it might be a little less intense without the chocolate wafer crust. (Maybe graham cracker crust?)

I loved this recipe! My husband and his friend raved about it and I have been asked to make it again and again. The only changes I made was to use the basic Oreo cookie pie crust recipe off of the box and melt the chocolate over it. I also double the recipe and make it in a cake dish, I have a lot of inlaws and one pie just doesn't go very far!

This was the worst dessert I have ever tasted. I will stick to the Black Bottom Chocolate Pie which has never failed.

My husband and I liked this pie, we didn't love it. The ganache was too much for the both of us. This surprised me because I love chocolate. The pastry cream is delicious and I will make this pie again without the ganache. The ganache will be great on the strawberries I have sitting here. I started the pastry cream first and put it in an ice bath to start the cooling process. Next, I made the crust, then the ganache. I didn't find the process to be tedious.

Everyone was so pleased with this pie. It is a wonderful variation on the traditional banana cream pie. But all the previous reviewers were right-- the crust is much too hard, making the pie nearly impossible to slice neatly. I recommend using the crust recipe from Bon Appetit's 1999 Black Bottom Chocolate Pie-- (only one ounce of chocolate, I think, and six tablespoons of butter, plus more cookie). It tastes just as good, but slices up much easier. I made this pie over three consecutive evenings: the pastry cream the first night, the ganache and pie crust on the second night, and the whipped cream on the third night. I assembled the pie on day three, (except for the whipped cream) and we ate it day four, right after I garnished with the cream (which I whipped again, as it lost volume overnight) and banana. Oh yes... do use very ripe bananas, otherwise their flavor will be lost.

The dessert was a big hit with my guests...not too sweet....not too heavy. It was difficult to cut, the chocolate in the crust makes it tough. I will make twice the vanilla pastry cream next time..only one batch was not enough. This pie is ALOT of work however....To me it seemed I worked on it all day.

Lush! My husband has requested this for birthday. I served it Christmas eve. Next ime I will drizzle a chocolate cookie crust with melted chocolate instead of mixing it into the crust. We had a hard time slicing the pie. I guess because the meltd choco makes the crust more dense and hard?!!

This is delicious and since making it the first time, my daughter has requested it as her birthday dessert every year since. However, I found the chocolate added to the crust crumbs made the crust too hard and very difficult to cut. When I make it this year, I'm going to leave out the extra chocolate and just use rich chocolate cookie crumbs and butter.

This pie was so good! It was a little hectic in the kitchen though. Next time I make it I'll probably make a little more of the pastry cream - although I think my pie plate was bigger than the recipe called for so maybe that was the problem. I also added some banana slices on top. But if you're bring this to a party and you want to put banana on top, I would suggest putting them on top right before serving. Mine turned a little brown - still tasted great, but it just would've looked pretty if the bananas were freshly put on top. I would definitely make this again, but not with a huge meal. A nice light meal to precede this pie would suffice. It is VERY heavy!!

I thought this pie was excellent just as it is written. I used Oreos for the crust. I did make one change when I made it a second time - I added more vanilla to the whipped cream and to the pastry cream. I love vanilla and a little extra made this pie even more wonderul.

This pie was VERY rich, great for any lover of chocolate and banana cream pie. However, I am a purist and much prefer the non-chocolate recipe. When I make this again I will probably omit the chocolate ganache and just make extra pastry cream for the middle.

Everyone keeps asking for more! The results make up for the time it takes to put it all together. I have found that this pie freezes well (for days actually), if covered with plastic right before the Vanilla Whip Cream Step. My family all agree that the pie tastes even better the next day. Can't wait to try the other "cooks" suggestion of trying different fruits!

I don't usually like banana cream pie or any kind of banana dessert, but my husband begged me to make it. We both thought it was great, though I would like it more if it had strawberries or raspberries instead of bananas. I will definitely make this again and will try it with different fruits.

I served my version of this pie at my husband's birthday party, and it was a HUGE success with all of my guests! I suggest using plain whipping cream instead of the Vanilla flavored one suggested here, and definitely use OREO cookies for the crust. Next time I'm not sure whether I will use the ganache---with the oreo cookie crust, the pie is rich enough without it.

This pie has been requested at every family holiday and also at assorted birthday parties for about two years now. My family loves this pie.

This pie was time-consuming and turned out to not be anything special. It was OK, but I think you could find better recipes with less fat content. If you do decide to make it be sure to use very ripe bananas or you won't be able to taste them at all.

I found this recipe to be very time consuming and in the end, not worth the while. The chocolate ganache never did set and the pie itself seemed to take longer that 3 hours as well. Although everyone said it was tasty, it wasn't visually very appealing and I found there to be a little too much chocolate in the recipe for such a delicate flavor like fresh bananas and cream. If I were to make it again, I would make just a standard chocolate crust and omit the ganache altogether.
