delicious! I liked it with boiled chicken, pulled apart by hand, and seasoned with some salt.

Thought I bought serranos but only found a large jalepeno in the fridge so used that (w/o seeds). The salsa was bright and tasty, but I'd add a bit more spice. We added diced red onion and cilantro to the tortillas when we assembled them, to taste, and my picky kids loved them. Will make again.

These were fantastic! The tomatillo salsa was great, very flavorful and not too spicy (I used 4 serrano chiles instead of 3 and I also only included seeds from 1 chile). Great comfort food! Make sure to buy a good, crumbly Mexican queso fresco.

The tomatillo salsa was very good and i would make that again. overall the recipe was bland and the salsa was not enough to flavor the whole thing appropriately.

Tomatillo salsa was delicious. I used flour tortillas, but found that heating them in the oil made them quite greasy. When I make burritos or enchiladas I usually just heat tortillas in microwave for a few seconds with wet paper towels in between. I bet that method would work well here, and cut down on the fat.

I loved this! I actually used blue corn tortillas and only two serranos (I like heat but 3 would have been too much). The salsa is amazing and we enjoyed the extra with corn chips. I am definitely going to be making this again, next time for my friends!

This is a brilliant recipe. I went on honeymoon to Merida and had tortillas in the market there. Suffice to say i have been trying for the last five years to reproduce the taste of them with no success....until tonight! Thanks Epicurious!

I used this recipe solely for the tomatillo salsa...although the rest of the dish sounds excellent. The salsa is SUPER easy to make and can easily be multiplied for a bigger batch to store for the week. We kept getting tomatillos in our CSA co-op and made this a few weeks in a row during the summer. Total yum.

Delicious. We tossed the chicken with a couple chipotle peppers in their sauce. It added a little sweetness to complement the tangy salsa. We also used sour cream and mozzarella cheese since those ingredients weren't available in my grocery store.

Like others, I tought that this recipe's flavor was outstanding. I elected to throw the chicken on my gas grill instead of boiling and it was wonderful. If I made it again, I wouldn't change a thing. I served it with a tossed salad topped with sliced oranges and jicama.

I made this dish tonight and found it delicious. It's easy to make, but unlike many easy dishes, it is actually very flavorful. Plus, it's delicious even when you make substitutions, as I did: sour cream for the crème fraîche, jalapeños for serranos, and alas no cilantro. The tomatillo sauce makes the dish. Also, I do recommend boiling the chicken and then shredding it -- the texture that way is somehow much more satisfying than regular sautéed chicken. I will be making this again, as soon as I get more tomatillos!

I thought it was really good but I only used one serrano and I'm glad I did. It had a nice bite, but three would have been way too hot. And I used a few more tomatillos than called for as well. I don't know, got the peppers fresh at the farmer's market this morning, maybe that's a difference? Anyway, we really enjoyed these. Did the tortillas on the burner flame as did others.

Fast, simple, tasty. I didn't have any leftover chicken, so I panfried some boneless thighs with chili powder, shredding the cooked thighs afterward. I used greek-style yoguart instead of crema, and mozza instead of queso fresco (because that's what we had in the house), and served chopped cilantro and chopped tomatoes each on the side. I didn't pare down the tortillas; like other reviewers I don't see the point in wasting good food. The tomatillo salsa is comforting and is also great on its own with chips. This dish was an instant hit with adults and kids. It immediately entered our weeknight rotation.

I really enjoyed this as a fun "eating in the living room" kind of dinner. I agree that cutting the tortillas is too wasteful so I just used the full sized tortillas.

I thought this recipe was very good. I thought the cutting down of regular tortillas was a little wasteful. (that just bugged me) The salsa was very good but I added a tablespoon of cumin, it added a lil more dimension to the salsa. I just heated up the torillas on a comal to cut out the oil. I added guacamole as well. Plus it didn't take 40 mins to cook it took about 20.

My daughter made this for our family and it was wonderful. Fresh! Sticking with the homemade tomatillo salas, rather then canned, is a must.

This was a delicious and quick dinner meal for us tonight. My daughters loved it! Thanks so much for another hit at my house epicurious!

Very good recipe and quick! We make it at least once a month. For a low fat version, I just cook the tortillas on the open flame on my stove top instead of frying....Great!

This was really good. The tomatillo salsa can be used for other dishes as well, and it is extremely easy to make. I've received requests to make it again. It's a definite keeper.

I loved this recipe so much, I ate it 2 days in a row. However on the second day I modified it a bit. I took the leftover chicken and moistened it with the sauce. I then took the tortillas, sprayed it w/vegetable spray and filled it with chicken and rolled. Topped w/more tomatillo sauce and baked til heated through. Removed from oven topped w/queso fresco. Great green enchiladas!!!

I am not sure if it is because I am now living in Mexico - just moved down from SF, CA, or what, but the peppers seem to be hotter down here. I remained true to the recipe except for 2 changes. 1 - I added a green bell pepper (seeded) to the tomatillo mixture after I tasted the original. I used a cup of the tomatillo mixture - a splash of chix stock and a green bell pepper and blended - and returned to the stove and simmered for another 5 -7 minutes to cut down on the heat. 2 - I squeezed fresh lime over the chalupas / tacos right before eating. Yum!!! Other than that - I made extra of everything - except the tortillas - and now I can assemble very quickly - just like the guys in the trucks at the end of the street!!!

This is a very good recipe. I used a roasted chicken from Sam's Club and it made the dish extra tasty. I used my own Tomatillo Salsa, which includes Poblano and Jalapeno Peppers as well as the Serranos & a lot more white onion. I simmer the vegies in water for about 20 minutes before blending. A nice, rich flavor. Husband and Mom loved it. I will make this often, as preparation is very simple.

This recipe is so amazing. Its so simple, but yet its like an awakening for the tastebuds. The flavor is like nothing else. I loved it. I didn't have tomatillos so I used on the vine cherry tomatoes, and I made my own crema by mixing 1 cup of heavy whipping cream with 2 tbsp of buttermilk, and I let it sit out overnight. Chilled after 8-24 hours of sitting at room temp. Add a bit of water to it right before serving. Try it, even if you are a bit scared of hot food, its so worth it.

To the cook from MA: I read the reviews to see what other changes people have made in order to decide if I want to incorporate those when I make it. It's also useful to know what substitutions can be made if I don't have all the ingredients on hand. You really shouldn't hate people who write the changes they made (unless they change the entire recipe), it's what makes these message boards useful.

Ironically, I have been making this dish for years, but in a different form (and I HATE people that write in with "changes"). However, this is a family staple if done easier and better: 1. Boil tomatillos first. Add a little bit of sugar. Cut down on H20. 2. Always fry tortillas. Deliciouso! 3. Poach a whole chicken for shredding. 3 lbs in cold H20 with peppercorns, 1/2 a white onion, bay leaves, bring to boil, skim scum. Boil for 20. Let sit in H20 for 30. Cool & shred. Save extra for tacos. Save broth. 4. Take a cup of reserved broth and add 2+ chipotles en adobo; blend. Add to chicken. 5. Top with paper thin slices of white onion, instead of chopped; slices of avocado. Perfect blend of heat, flavor and crunch.

Pretty good. I made the following adjustments: didn't fry the tortillas (they were warm and fresh from the market) and used reduced fat sour cream. Also, after heating the salsa it seemed to be pretty watery so I drained off some of the extra liquid. In the future I think I'll add another Serrano or two -- I thought it needed a bit more kick.
