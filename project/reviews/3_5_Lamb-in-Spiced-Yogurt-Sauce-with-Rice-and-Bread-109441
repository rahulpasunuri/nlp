The reason this recipe is getting mixed results is the yogurt. The yogurt is key and to my knowledge it is usually made with a goats milk yogurt which has a more unique flavor. Check an Arab store for something called Jameed. This is what is traditionally used.

This was a delicious recipe. I used lamb neck instead of shoulder and I took it off the bone after the initial braising but followed the rest to a T. The meat was succulent and the yogurt sauce was very flavorful. I used Greek yogurt and mine didn't curdle at all. Definately worth making again.

In itself this is a very good recipe but I just didn't care for the flavours. I thought the yogurt (I used Turkish with 10% fat) tasted weird after stabilizing - and it still more or less curdled. I also cut down on the cooking time as my lamb was already very tender halfway through. The spices were okay though.

Loved this recipe! The flavor was amazing--spices heavenly! The yogurt did not curdle after stabilizing as called for. Definitely a repeat!
