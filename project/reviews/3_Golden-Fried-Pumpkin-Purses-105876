This recipe was a lot of work! The flavor of the purses was bland and my friends and I thought that they needed some kind of dipping sauce. Not impressed. I gave them two forks instead of one because they aren't awful. They just aren't worth the time.

I actually made this dish about a year and a half ago for the annual Christmas Tea that I throw for my girlfriends and these cute little "purses" were a HUGE hit!! They were the first things to go, and some of these ladies hate pumpkin!!! They were time consuming, but beyond worth it!!! A must for pumpkin lovers(like me!!!) and haters alike!!!
