Excellent recipe, though not for those with unrefined, inexperienced palettes.

This burger was great and has since been added to the repertoire! I added one egg yolk to help keep the burgers from falling apart. Next time I think we'll use Dijon instead of yellow mustard (it was not overpowering as other reviews suggest).

Delicious. Loved everything. Indeed it is messy.

It is a great joy to see this dominican recipe in such a great site like this. Neverthelless, without the intent of disappointing you, you got this wrong at many levels. First of all the real history behind the name is that this street delicacy was created by an argentinian migrant who in the 80's open up a food cart in his driveway, her served what would be a argentinian "choripan" with chimichurri sauce. Following Dominican spirit, people started calling it "chimichurri" and later on just "chimi" creating a branding for all street food carts whom later served the dish. With time a lot of variations were added such as the cabbage, carrots, etc. Actually this was done to bulk up the sandwich and save on the amount of meat. Regarding the recipe, first of all, the "chimi" must be done with a grilled "chorizo" or similar sausage which is later open up by the middle. Also it is served in "pan de agua" which is a bread very similar to a French Baguette.

I could not believe how good this is! The only disappointment was, IMO, a bit to much mustard but that was only me; no one else had a complaint. Also a warning, this is messy! Next ones will be wrapped in foil or butcher's paper.

Great recipe.....my boyfriend and I love it, we prefer grilling the patties, however I've made then at home too. They kinda remind me of the ones that I had growing up in New York. Some say it may call for to much cilantro, but I'm dominican, we're immune...lol...Big thumbs up.

Very Good, I pureed the garlic and cilantro with a little bit of olive oil. Turned out great. The Ketchup, mustard, and mayo combination was surprisingly good! I will make this again.

Delicious! Used a bit less cilantro then called for based on personal taste but otherwise followed exactly. These were great. We have made these several times: as the recipe calls for and as mini- burgers for a party. Glowing reviews from the party guests!

Too much cilantro flavor that I don't think complimented a burger. Definitely no repeats.

This was nothing to write home about. I must admit that I made them quite a bit thinner than the recipe suggested and this may have made a difference in the overall experience.

This recipe is perfect for entertaining or simply a quick lunch at home. It is delicious! I cooked the cabbage and carrots for about 6-7 minutes instead of 2 and we didn't put onions on top! We also did not fry the patties but instead cooked it in George Foreman. I highly recommend making this recipe. We call it our "chimi."

Very nice and tasty. It reminded me of the burgers from the street stands in many different countries. Pack the burgers tight though...they can fall apart pretty easily. You definitely don't want to grill these patties so pan fry them as suggested.

Would'nt change a thing. Reminds me of the ones that I used to eat when I was young in New York. My boyfriend and I could'nt get enough.

I'm not going to give it a fork rating, because I did not have all the ingredients to follow the recipe to a T. Still, I don't think I'd try this again, personally. Maybe I'm just a burger purist, but this flavor/tecture combination didn't do it for me.

A great improvement on the common hamburger Loved all stages of this dish. A bit time consuming for a work night dinner but worth it

Delicious! Everything about these burgers is good: the taste, the texture, the sauce, the toppings. The sauce is surprisingly delicious.
