Eww. I couldn't find red currant jelly, so I substituted grape jelly. Bad call. Tastes like grape jelly and onions. Hoping overnight in the fridge improves it as another reviewer said.

@creativechemist from La Jolla: The combination of the currant jelly and the cider vinegar is so as to TART IT UP. (laughter, applause)

Decent enough. I was skeptical of the onions but with an overnight in the fridge came out good. Was easy and added nice flavor. Liked the change from the regular jellied sauce.

OK so it's easy and tasty but why would you take something wonderfully tart like cranberries and artificially sweeten it up with 12 oz of preserved currant jelly containing over 200 grams of sugar (nearly = 1 cup) and then attempt to restore the tart flavor with 1/4 cup of cider vinegar. Why not leave the berries alone? I don't get it....

Easy, appealing, and so delicious. I'm printing this recipe again for friends!

My Mother and I have always hated cranberry sauce, especially the jellied canned stuff. We both like the taste of cranberry juice, but the other stuff is too sweet. I found this recipe, several years ago. We both love cranberry onion relish. I make it on the tart side.

I've never tried making cranberry sauce or relish before but had to try this recipe, it looked so easy. It really was easy to make and tasted superb. I'm looking forward to making it a part of my holiday tradition again and again!
