i thought this was tasty! I added sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds and a bit of peanut satay sauce. which made it even more tasty! I Also sauteed the pesto for a bit before I tossed the pasta in, to mellow the garlic flavor.

This dish was so overpowering that I didn't enjoy it. Even my undiscerning boyfriend had trouble eating it!

I found this surprisingly bland and certainly wouldn't make it again. It might be better with italian pesto. You certainly don't want to spare the salt! For my money, the Shrimp Pasta Salad, Jan 1994 on this site is much better.

I need to make this again and add a chili pepper or two as per other reviews. I would also cut back on the onions by about a third. I just need to tweak it a bit, as that is what a lot of other reviewers have done. It would probably make a great cold pasta salad if one omitted the shrimp (and therefore the ptomaine risk).

Excellent! This recipe is quick and delicious. My husband, who does't care much for cilantro, just loved this recipe. I also added some chili oil to it. I definitely will make it again.

For an extra kick, I added Thai chilis to the the pesto while blending. Great addition.

Really fast and delicious! Cooking time was less than 20 minutes. I added a little more lime and some black pepper. I will definately make this again!

This dish is absolutely delicious! I topped each serving with a few roasted, unsalted peanuts--which added a nice texture. Will definitely make again!

A bit of late harvest riesling vinegar + a dash of roasted sesame oil = no leftovers

I made this for two parties this spring and it was a hit. I love cilantro, and the lime gave the dish a unique taste.

I didn't care for this recipe, I thought the Ginger and Garlic overpowered the Cilantro, I would prefer to taste more of the Cilantro, so next time I will make a sauce with the Cilantro, diced Tomatoes, Green Onion, and Garlic.

This recipe was great, and my whole family loved it. I mixed in sugar snap peas to make it was a one-dish meal.

So simple, so tasty. My husband doesn't usually like nuts in his dinner, but he liked it. Even asked for more.

My boyfriend and I loved this dish - but we both like cilantro a lot. The amount of cilantro is not a typo - you need a lot of it to make the 'pesto'. I added a jalapeno to the sauce the second time I made this dish for added spice.

I'm crazy about this recipe. It's not for everybody -- I think it's the raw ginger that's so strong, but to me, terrific. I couldn't get enough of it or the left-overs. I'll play with tweaking it -- red peppers as somebody recommended, etc., but the basic recipe is right-on.

I tried this recipe on my husband and his friend and they loved it. I made it last night for the second time without the shrimp and it was just as good. Easy to make and inexpensive without the shrimp. I only used 2 tablespoons of cilantro, as recommended by others. The flavors really compliment one another well.

There must be a typo here-- cut the cilantro to two TABLESPOONS, and you're in business. Otherwise, the other reveiwer is right-- It DOES overpower the dish. The whole thing tastes like dish soap. But, when you reduce the amount of cilantro, increase the garlic and ginger-- fantastic!

Funky color and blend of flavors.

Both my husband and I liked this recipe. I found it spicey and full of flavour. The only thing I would add is fresh red peppers to give it more texture. I would make this for company since it's easy and tasty!!

This was very bland and had a grainy texture. The cilantro flavor took over the entire dish and was overpowering. But, I couldn't taste the garlic or ginger that was included. I expected a lot more out of this dish and would not recommend it or make it again.

This is good hot or cold. I brought it to a pot luck & gave the recipe away to alot of friends! Easy to make too.

Loved this recipe and certainly would make it again.

I assumed this recipe would be good made ahead - WRONG. I served this cold, directly from the refrigerator and it was SO-SO. In fact, as it warmed up it got better. The leftovers when HEATED were much better tasting. All in All - pretty darn good, just be sure to not make my mistake.

Probably needs some fish sauce to give it a more "thai" taste, but its delicious as it is. Its a light pasta dish with a difference.

we really enjoyed this dish! even my 9 year old son had seconds! i didn't have peanut oil, so added a bit more ground peanuts. i'll make it again and again!

Made this last night with exact ingredients, except with only 2 TBLS of lime juice. Unlike some reviewers we didn't find this bitter. We loved it. It's a keeper!

I've made this several times and liked it a lot! About half of the pesto is plenty for the amount of pasta called for - it was definitely overpowering when I used the full amount of pesto the first time I made it.

We found this bitter and nearly inedible. The only change I made was substituting cayenne for red pepper flakes --- which shouldn't make such a big difference. I suspect the culprit was either the lime juice or perhaps the raw garlic.

Made this dish with fresh Aussie prawns, home grown limes & chilli. A sensational entree!!

I added 2 tbsp peanut butter and some extra peanuts. I should have omitted the lime juice as that was what gave it an off flavor. I also used 50% more shrimp.

It was so easy to make! I loved that part of it. We thought something was missing, although I added about 1/8 cup more peanuts, and that helped. Next time I'm going to use a spoonful of peanut butter in the sauce and see what that does. We loved the shrimp in it, and you'll definitely want to use a little salt. My husband thought it was heavy on the lime, but he added more red pepper to his, and he had a second helping. (It serves more than two.) Our 3 and 5 year old children would only eat the shrimp. We'll make it again.

This is less a Thai-like recipe and more like a spicy pesto recipe, although it is still tasty and quick. I might try adding something sweet to offset the heat and acidity from the lone - maybe sugar snap peas or diced red pepper?

Rating: 2
The cilantro pesto in this dish is very good. In fact I would love to use the pesto in other aspects of my cooking. The rest of the recipe, however, leaves something to be desired. First of all - the lime juice makes the final product far too acidic. There is no real balance of flavors. Try cutting the lime juice by 75%. Second - as the pesto heats up it loses a great deal of its color. You might want to toss really hot pasta with it off the heat. Third - there isn't enough color in this dish. The monochromatic toxic green is too much - try adding tomato concasse or julienne of red peppers.

I absolutely loved this recip! Unfortunately, my family didn't care for it. If you love cilantro and the tang of the lime, you will really enjoy this recipe. I also found that the portions served more than 2 people (more like 5)

With a salad and a piece of bread, this will definitely serve 4. It is very, very good.

Fantastic. The most original and the best shrimp recipe I have tried in a long time.
