Simple recipe, but very tasty with the fresh lemon peel and juice. I had left over asparagus and broiled salmon and was able to turn it into a delicious entree.

Really enjoyed this recipe on paper, but I wasn't sure it translated well onto the plate. I felt the sauce could be a bit smoother, although I was a bit reluctant to up the butter content. On the positive side, I think the salmon caviar is spot-on. It provides just enough taste and texture contrast. Really cut through some of the richness. Will certainly try again and tinker a bit.

Call me crazy, I have turned this recipe into a party-stunning hors d'oeuvre. This is a "name maker". Cook tortellini of your choice al dente. Make the lemon-cream sauce but thicken with (1) more parmesan and (2) 1 to 2 t. corn starch. Skewer one al dente cooked asparagus tip (12" skewer) then one tortellini. Spoon lemon cream sauce over the tortellini, sprinkle with black caviar and finish with a chive "X" on the tort. Stick the skewers into a face down half melon (watermelon is great!) and serve from a well presented tray or plate. Pure drama and fabulous flavor. Tonight the bride-to-be was exultant that the groom-to-be ate caviar and didn't even notice. Four requests for the recipe. Try it. Blow the pants off of your guests!

I made this using broccolini instead of asparagus, and diced Nova Lox instead of salmon caviar because I couldn't locate salmon caviar on short notice. It's quite rich, very good, with a nice lemony counterpoint to the overall creamy mouthfeel.

I made this for a Valentine's day for my husband and myself as a first course. I loved it! It was so tasty that I can still remember the flavor in my mouth. My husband, who is a meat lover, loved it so much that he didn't seem to notice the filet mignon main course that much. I am making this again for this coming Valentine's day for sure.

One of my favorites. Very simple and very tasty, did it with red caviar an looked very Christmas way, also. Everybody was very impressed.

This dish is really quite nice. The sauce is very tasty. I would serve it to guests, for lunch, to the book club, something like that. I used wild salmon, seared in olive oil then flaked into the pasta. If you double the lemon, it will overpower the dish.

yum yum yum- i didn't have the caviar just sitting in my pantry, so I made it without it and thought it was great. Very nice for summer, and without the caviar, a great dish to serve to your vegetarian friends!

This recipe is delicous! I forgot an ingrediant and my fiance doesn't like cream-based pasta and still it was a huge hit. I'm making it again for Valentine's Day and serving it with champagne. this time, I'm buying two ounces of salmon caviar...

This dish was wonderful. I have had several requests for the recipe. Also, it's fairly versatile. If you don't like caviar, shrimp or other seafood can be substituted.

This was excellent! Next time I will double the sauce and pasta volume because my husband and I eat this and nothing else. It didn't seem to be enough for two. We are pasta addicts and this is fabulous!

It is indeed a very simple and tasty dish to prepare and goes great with champagne. I recommend using the thinnest asparagus you can find so as not to overwhelm the fettucine's texture. Zesting the lemon peel works great (and double the amount if you're a true lemon fan). The salmon roe really provides a great punch!

Served this to a friend who is an excellent cook herself and she raved. I knew it was a keeper!

Too sum up my opinion...OMIGOD! This was just so good and so easy. Made it and didn't change a single ingredient. I did add only cook the asparagus for 2 minutes, no more; and added the pasta to the pot containing the cream mixture and gently tossed with caviar. The caviar adds just the right amount of saltiness and flavor. Definite keeper and just in time for this season of asparagus and lemons.

This dish is easy, quick and elegant. Don't skimp on the ingredients. Warm bowls are key in keeping everything warm since tossing everything together at the last minute made it cold pretty quickly. Make sure to serve with freshly grated pepper. Yum.

This is delicious! I zested the lemon instead of grating and it infused perfectly. The ingredients aren't something you'd stock otherwise it would have been a definite 4!
