A quick, easy, delcious way to prepare small potatoes. A great accompaniment to most entrees! I cooked at 450 degrees for 15 minutes.

Simple and delicious! I used small Yukon Gold potatoes and cut them in half after reading some of the other reviews. I also recommend stirring them a couple times while roasting to prevent sticking to the pan. The dish is perfect as is, but I'm also looking forward to adding rosemary and/or garlic in the future.

So easy and very good! Used a lot more olive oil but they were perfectly crispy on the outside!

I made this and my wife loved it. I added a tiny bit of minced garlic and black pepper for a bit more flavor, and I cut the potatoes into half-wedges. This will definitely become a staple side dish in our house.

I followed the recipe exactly and for some reason the potatoes stuck to the pan. This never happened before. I usually boil my potatoes for about 4-7 minutes and then roast them at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes and they never stick. In any case, the potatoes tasted great even though they looked pretty sad without their skins. Maybe I'll use more olive oil next time.

Healthy recipe but the potatoes were chewy on the outside instead of crisp like I was expecting. Maybe it was just the quality of my potatoes.......

If I had realized that roasted potatoes were so easy I would have made them ages ago...perfect for weeknights- but tasty enough for weekends. Try with sweet potatoes- they're lower on the glycemic index and just as delicious!

I haven't made this dish, but I just thought I would mention that if anyone would rather do something a bit jazzier, the recipe for garlic and rosemary potatoes on this site is phenomenal. (The comments about rosemary reminded me.)

The suggestion to cut the potatoes in half to get a crisp crust is a winner. Very simple, very tasty.

I am not generally much of a potato person (too bland and starchy for me) but these are great. I didn't do anything to my baby Yukon Golds (cut, peel, etc) except wash them and cut out the eyes. I agree with Austin, TX - throw in some fresh rosemary.

great recipe. I like to add a little fresh rosemary to the oil and potatoes too.

I used baby Yukon Golds split in half. I put the cut side and they got this wonderful crust on them from the oil. LOVED these.

Hmmm, let me think here: potato, fat (oil or butter), salt and an oven. Hello? Did anyone really need instructions?

Perfect, recipe was not terribly clear, but I had to peel the potato, due to the potato's quality, and cut it into wedges. They needed to be turned and scraped 2x while cooking, but what could be easier?

Very simple and so tasty. I would definitely recommend these as a quick side dish.

So simple yet so delicious. I added cracked black pepper to the salt mixture and used small red potatoes cut in half. A basic and a keeper.

Easy and delicious. I used small red potatoes quartered and kept them in the oven for closer to an hour for a crispier outside and a moister interior. The potatoes taste as if they're dripping in butter -- how nice that they're so healthy! I'll make these often --

Had these in a restraurant and loved them, never dreamed they were so easy to make at home. Will definately make them often.
