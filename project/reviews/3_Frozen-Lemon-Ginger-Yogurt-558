Absolutely gorgeous frozen yogurt/ice cream combo, but using the cream felt like cheating. I used Greek yogurt and half & half, left out the ginger and served atop angel food cake with raspberry sauce. Lovely!

The ice cream tastes great, but I didn't much care for the big chunks of ginger. Next time I would try grating the ginger, or squeezing the minced ginger and adding just the juice. The flavors would mix better that way.

This is very refreshing and tasty. Especially good topped with fresh rasberries or strawberries.
