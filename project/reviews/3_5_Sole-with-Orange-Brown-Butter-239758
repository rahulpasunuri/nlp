Must have done something wrong as the sauce had little flavor-it was easy though!

Loved this, and will serve it to company. Following the picture, I put orange peel on top when serving. I used lemon sole, green onions, and very little butter. To accompany it, I roasted broccoli and then put it in a skillet with toasting almond and then a bit of orange juice. When serving, also put a bit of orange peel over the broccoli.

Delicious and simple. As another reviewer noted, you can cut down on the butter a little bit to keep it healthier and there is no noticeable loss in flavor (the citrus and seasoning keep plenty of dimension). Will absolutely make this again, a great summer dinner!

This was quick, easy, & delicious. I followed the recipe & added some sauteed halved cherry tomatoes and sliced shiitake mushrooms to the sauce. I'm definitely making this one again!

This was wonderful and easy. Changed my attitude about sole, but I used a fish spatula and was very careful to only cook a couple minutes on one side and one minute on the other; then remove very carefully. Cut down a bit on the butter for the sauce - no point in making something so healthy as fish into an artery killer, but I'm sure more butter would have been yummier. All around great recipe.

About as easy and tasty as they come. I prefer not to measure ingredients, and this recipe worked out great when I just approximated.The whole thing took less than ten minutes. The sole did fall apart, but that always seems to happen to me with sole.

I used green onions since I had these and not the shallots. All I can say is YUM! It was easy and pretty quick. And best of all, it passed the kids test. They ate it all up :)

Really easy, quick recipe. Be careful not to overcook the fish, though. We had no shallots so I sliced a mushroom into the pan with a couple of cherry tomatoes when adding the orange juice. Worked really well, very tasty - will definitely make this again.

delicious and fast! I would use a little less oil but would make again in a heartbeat. FYI - I used lemon sole

I'll admit, I did the typical--changed the recipe so much, it hardly looked like itself! but, hubby doesn't like orange, so just used a lemon half, also added capers for an extra kick. Delish! We all loved it.

Forgot to season. Used olive oil instead of veg oil. Prob less butter and onion instead of shallot. It was good! I also fried tomatoes on the vine after adding the orange juice in the mix like in the photo. Nice!

Just read "a cook from Boston" review, and yes, it seems you used far too much lemon.

I made this instead by cooking the fillets in white wine and butter in a baking dish. I used blood oranges for the sauce, which looked and tasted lovely. I am looking forward to making this again.

We made some changes to your recipe and it turned out great. No Shallots so we used a thinly sliced onion. No orange juice so we used a citrus mill with half a lemon and a whole tangerine. Added some peprika and some coriander. It was great!

This was ok - I found the sauce to be a bit too lemony so if you make it go light on the lemon (of course I used a whole one which may have been too much. It wasn't bad, just not my favorite
