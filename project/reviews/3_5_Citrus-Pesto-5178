Omitted lemon, added lime zest and flat leaf parsley; stirred into couscous. Very good.

Like the previous reviewer, I found this a bit dry and had to add more olive oil, and I've found it's better mixed with a more liquid sauce than on its own. I increased the garlic and left out the lime because I had none(increased the lemon proportionally). I'm glad to have a lower-fat version of my favorite that still tastes good. When basil is in season and cheap, I make a lot of pesto and freeze it up in ice-cube trays. The cubes go in a ziplock bag in the freezer, and I have easy access to whatever amount I want for a recipe.

This is a great light summer meal. Make sure to use very fresh basil. It seemed a little dry, so I added extra olive oil and lemon juice.

Easy to make, but final flavor was a little bland. I like pesto with a stronger flavor.

Fantastic! Light, easy and just delicious. Not a great dish for leftovers. Did not reheat well at all. Enjoy.

use the zest of citrus so pesto is not so wet and the flavor will blossom more in cooking.
