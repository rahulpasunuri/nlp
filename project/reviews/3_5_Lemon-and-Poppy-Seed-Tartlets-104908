This was easy and good. I made it into tiny tartlets, using a mini muffin pan that holds 2 dozen mini muffins. I scooped a heaped teaspoonful of the dough into each and tamped it with a floured 'tamper' (that came with the pan), which made it even easier. I cooked them a bit less, and had to watch them like a hawk so as not to brown too much. I used a rounded 1/2 tsp of lemon curd each, then piped the whipped cream on top. They were a huge hit! Loved the small size for a crowd that I cook for every week.

These are lovely. I've made them small and big. The crust is a little delicate but very nice.

I followed this recipe to the tee. Turned out quite nice. We made it for Easter and it was a hit.

The tart crust was too crumbly, it was light and fluffy which is good, but it just fell apart instantly.

I generally like lemon treats, but this one missed the mark for me. It lacked the crisp, tart flavors I look for.

I've made this several times and everyone raves. However, there is not enough flour in the dough recipe. Also, to prevent the dough from slipping down the sides, I always place a piece of aluminum foil in each shell and fill it with pie weights or dry beans.

I didn't have tartlet pans, so I used a 9-inch tart pan w/ removable bottom. Worked great! I read the previous reviews about the tart shell baking flat, so half way through the baking time, I removed the shell from the oven and pretty much burned my fingers as I pressed the dough back up the sides of the pan. It worked... This was the first time that I used my food processor to make the crust and I'm afraid that I overworked it a little. I thought it was a little chewy, but a friend reassured me that it was the right texture. I replaced the whipped cream with fresh fruit: blueberries, blackberries and nectarines. Looked beautiful. A real hit! One of the guests nearly licked the pan! I'll definitely try this one again!!

I made these tarts this weekend for Easter and they were quite a hit -- I was even asked at what bakery I bought them! Since this was my first time making lemon curd, I was a little nervous (I bought bottled curd, just in case) but the recipe is very easy to work with and held up to my husband's (he's a chef) curd test -- when held upside down, the curd stayed in place. I made a shortbread crust recipe from Joy of Cooking which is quite easy to work with -- no rolling pin required.

I used a 9" square tart pan and it was just right. It made 9 servings. I made the curd over a double boiler so it took longer to make but it turned out great. I quit cooking the curd when thick enough to hold the marks of the whisk.

I made this for a party last week and all my friends loved it very much and some of them asked me for the recipe.It tasted very good but my family said there's too much butter...I will make it again and i'd like to ask how can i make it low-fat?

I made this recipe for "High Tea", and it was wonderful. I used 2.5 inch tartlett molds and doubled the recipe for the crust. It made 26 tartletts and had plenty of lemon curd left over. The lemon curd recipe alone is worth it. The dough was sticky to say the least...a little diffucult to work with at first, but great tasting and great looking. My guests loved these tartletts! I will definitely make these again and again.

I have now made this for 2 occasions and it was a great hit with my family. I did not bother to remove the lemon zest from the curd thorough a sieve. It still tasted fine and more lemony after chilling overnite.

I didn't have tart pans, so I used muffin tins that were approx. the same size. Wasn't terribly impressed... though my husband loved them. Good concept... Might try again and see if my 'just okay' results were a fluke.

Absolutely wonderful! I made one 9-inch tart instead of mini-tarts and left the lemon juice out of the whipped cream; I wanted cream on lemon, not lemon on lemon.

This recipe totally flopped for me. The dough was too sticky, even when slightly reducing the water as suggested. The tarts didn't hold up in the oven, they fell to the bottom of the pans. I now have strange, flat, poppyseed disks, and some lovely lemon curd. I think I'll make lemon mousse and serve it with "poppyseed cookies!" (when life hands you a lemon...)

Beautiful, fresh, and perfect! Instead of making mini tarts, I made a large 9-inch one, rolled the dough into a ball and chilled it both before and after putting it in the pan (not sure if all this was necessary), and weighted it while baking. Wonderful!

Excellent! Just the right amaount of tart/sweet. I found these very easy to make and everyone loved them. I used the leftover lemoncurd for Blueberry tarts the following weekend.

OK, so I used prepared pastry (shoot me). I served these alongside chocolate things, and everybody loved them, even those who "don't do dessert." Wonderful that the lemon curd can be made ahead.

These tartlets were a big hit! All of my guests loved them, even the children. While everything turns out well in the end, this recipe does have a few flaws. Here are some things to note. The pastry gets too sticky and didn't make eight tarts, only seven. Try a bit less water. Also, the curd ultimately thickened in the refrigerator after a few hours. So plan to make it ahead. But do make these tartlets!

I made this recipe for a party last Sunday. It was very easy to make the seperate parts and assemble them quickly at the last minute. The only change that I made was to place candied violets on the top for presentation. A delishious recipe.

Light; like a summer treat.
