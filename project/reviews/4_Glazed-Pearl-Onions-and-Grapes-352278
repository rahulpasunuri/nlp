So good. Raves from all at Easter dinner with pork roast. No problem finding the red pearl onions. Unfortunately, could not find Sherry vinegar. Substituted balsamic and white wine vinegars.

I didn't have sherry vinegar so I used dry sherry and balsamic vinegar. I used frozen onions and did not add the grapes. It was delicious everyone loved them.

I'll preface by saying I could not find red pearl onions, so I used white, frozen Bird's Eye. I followed the recipe exactly other than that. Even though the 4 of us love onions and love grapes, we did not enjoy this dish.

We first tried this recipe in April and thought it would be a nice addition to our Thanksgiving meal. It was a surprise hit with our guests and we'll make it again.

Great recipe. I do alot of entertaining and this dish was fabulous Can be done completely ahead of time. Everyone loved it. I would definitely make it time and time again if I could find frozen onions.

My market did have tiny red onions, but it would have taken half my paycheck to buy enough for this recipe, so I too used Birdseye frozen--a one pound package was just right for the other ingredients in this recipe. I did not bother to defrost or precook, just extended the cooking time a little. You can do this entirely on top of the stove if you want--just as good. The dish is unusual and delicious, and the menu it is part of (especially the herbed pork roast and the green beans with a touch of celery salt) was one of the best Gourmet dinners I have ever cooked, and I've been subscribing for 40 years.

My local market did not have the purple onions so we used frozen white pearl onions with the purple grapes, which made prep even faster. Delicious!

Made this for Easter, perfect paring for glazed mustard/orange ham.

yes, grapes and onions sounds strange...but this dish was a hit, very unique (and pretty)
