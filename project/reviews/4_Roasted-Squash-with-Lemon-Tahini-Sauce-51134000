This was absolutely delicious. Served for New Year's Eve dinner with ham, stewed tomatoes and sauteed kale, and the combination was amazing. Super simple, and the tahini sauce and hint of cumin made the dish very fresh and interesting.

2 pounds and frankly the skin had turned colour and wasn't very appetising so I peeled it and didn't use the delicata squash. Other than that followed the recipe exactly. This was a very tasty and different side, and went very nicely with chicken curry and dahl.

We frankly gorged on this. It was to die for.
