Very delicious tart. The dough was a bit difficult to work with but came out well. I reduced the sugar based upon other reviews. I substituted cardamon for the mace as we like that spice with pears.

This recipe was a huge hit at a family gathering. The toasted almonds added great texture and flavor to the tart. I needed to add more fruit than the recipe called for to fill my tart pan, and used more apples than pears (about 3 apples and 2 pears). Made this with Gala apples as they are more crisp and tart than Golden Delicious. I didn't have mace so I substituted cinnamon. To give it a little more spice I added nutmeg and increased the amount of cinnamon a little (as compared to the amount of mace the recipe called for).

I used non-stick cupcake tins: lined each 'cupcake' with the crust, filled with fruit standing on end, and carried on. Baked only about 35 minutes. Took tartlets out and put in circle around a shallow bowl, filled center of the bowl with whipped cream. Fun and yummy.

I made this last minute one night for a birthday so i didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I had to replace the mace with cinnamon, orange peel instead of the lemon and i had to exclude the pears. Dispite all the changes it was a huge hit, everyone loved it. I did have a bit of trouble with the dough but i think that could have been fixed by simply chilling it a bit longer.

The filler ingredients have been a go-to, although with alternate - and more reliable (for me) - pate brisse recipes. I also have replaced the suggested topping with a small slice of maytag blue. Amazing -- even my 6 year old loves this combination. Oh, by the way - being generous with the lemon zest is never hurtful.

Very tasty. I took the advice of previous reviewers to increase the amount of fruit. I substituted ground cardamom for the mace, and it went nicely with the pear and lemon flavors. I struggled with the crust--the waxed paper bunched up while rolling out the dough--but it proved to be very forgiving.

This tart was great! I substituted cinnamon for the mace and for 1/2 of the sugar I used brown sugar. I will definitely make this again!

The mace was way too strong. Either substitute all spice or do 1/2 the mace.

I made thie mistake of mixing the apples & pears directly with the sugar mixture, but it was yummy nonetheless. I suggest using more apples/pears, as the filling was rather paltry on my tart. I used lemon verbana and lemon juice instead of the grated lemon peel.

Huge success and delicious. Substituted nutmeg for mace, and toasted pine nuts for almonds. Made the whipped cream with a little rum and vanilla.

I loved how easy this recipe was to play with and make your own. I used a refrigerated crust, and substituted cinnamon for the mace. Super easy prep, and delicious!!

I've made this 3 times and it's always been a hit. Easy to make and is a nice presentation. The almonds in the crust make a big difference.

This was absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I used cinnamon instead of mace and added an extra apple - next time I'll add an extra pear as well. I used granny smith apples - which are not too sweet. My guests loved the distinctive flavors of the almonds, lemon zest, apples and pears. This is a winner

This was a delicious and fairly easy recipe. The crust was excellent and the only changes I made were cutting back to 1/4 c. sugar and adding cinnamon instead of the mace. I also bought an excellent pear liquer to go in the cream and served some in a glass along with the pie. It was the hit of our dinner!

Love it! Have made this so many times I almost have the recipe committed to memory. A nice change.

Used Calvados instead of pear schnapps. Thought the filling needed a little tapioca or flour to thicken. Also added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract to filling to enhance almond flavor.

Tough to use all those pears..and this recipe did it for me. Great flavour, a hit with guests. Made it again with just apples too. A definite in pear season next year.

A nice chance from a pie. I have made it twice (it's not that time-consuming) and received compliments both times. The whipped cream really makes a difference!

Too sweet,sugar overwhelmed the fruit. The mace was overwhelming - half as much would have been plenty. Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought the crust lacked something, and it didn't need the sugar either.

This was a little time consuming to make but worth it. Delicious and impressive. The whipped cream made a big difference!

Foregot to get lemons. Substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon peel with lemon,lime, and orange peel, terrific!! Made it for Mother's Day definite brownie points.The kids felt the cream with brandy was a bit much.

I have made this tart for the last five Thanksgivings, at the behest of friends and family. They all love it, and enjoy the kudos. I have never been told it's too sweet, probably because I add extra lemon peel (about 1/4 teaspoon) and lemon juice (about 1 tablespoon) to the filling.

This was the first tart I ever made (or pie for that matter) and it was simple and easy to do. More importantly it tasted GREAT and I really impressed my guests (one woman who has written a cookbook - so that made me feel good!!) The apples and pears are so delicious this time of year and the tart is light and has a sophisticated taste. The best thing about this tart is that the crust does not totally fall apart when you cut into it to serve, everything stayed in tact. I did not use as much sugar as it called for, I did not use the whipped cream either but I added cinnamon on top before baking. A wonderful dish, a real crowd pleaser and something to impress your friends with - even if you are not a gourmet cook. Can make the day ahead - just let cool, refridgerate and warm in oven on 300 for 10-15 minutes before serving. I would not serve piping hot.

This recipe was good, however, I would not add as much sugar as the recipe requires.
