this is a perfect base muffin, but readers should be cautioned that these are very old school..the recipe is from the fanny farmer cookbook, and the muffins taste nothing like the sweet, cake like behemoths you see today. as others have commented, they lend themselves beautifully to updates.. i usually add blueberries, but today before baking them, i put a dollop of my handmade blackberry jam in the center of each muffin, and gave it a little swirl...they were marvelous. next time, i will do the same thing with a bit of rhubarb compote...

I have tried variations for this muffin recipe it being a basic one and all... however I have never quite found a good one! Only a backup to me.

This is such a great base recipe! The first time, I added raspberries and a little more milk, as the batter seemed too dry. They came out lovely, although not particularly sweet. I and my BF liked them, but they certainly didn't resemble (in sweetness) store-bought muffins. Today, I added one mashed ripe banana and half a bag of chocolate chips (didn't need to add additional milk this time) ... so incredibly yummy (particularly while hot)! There might not be any for breakfast tomorrow!

Added more sugar than called for, but delicious. Added chocolate chips. Yum.

Very simple recipe, which lets me push it in a lot of different ways. I had no problems with the dryness that others mentioned.

I made these the other night and substituted applesauce for the oil, and with only 1/4 cup sugar, these are quite the healthy treat. I made them with 1/2cup of raspberries and turned them into texas sized muffin tins, baked for 32mins each. I loved the fact that they weren't sweet and just slightly dense. My bf said these were the best muffins I've ever made.

I make this recipe with 1/4 vanilla sugar and about 1/2-2/3 cup of chocolate chips. They are an easy and tasty way to start a saturday morning!

These were tough and dense and nowhere in the vicinity of sweet. I tried them stricly by the recipe and with the suggested tweaking, and nothing really helped...there are definitely better muffins to be made and eaten.

I made these muffins with fresh mixed berries (blue, rasp, and black) and added a couple of teaspoons of lemon zest. Yum--the perfect muffin, with a slightly crisp top and a dense, moist crumb. The key is not to overwork the batter; mix lightly and they won't be dry or scone-like.

I grew up on this muffin recipe, and still use it to rave reviews, but over the years I've made 3 alterations/improvements that help them shine 1. add @ 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract 2. esp. for blueberry muffins or apple/nut variety, decrease sugar to 1/3 cup but add 1 TBL of lemon zest and 3. add a dask of nutmeg, cinnamon or both to give it some added punch. Just don't overwork them. That's what really kills any muffin recipe and turns them into tough, doughy globs.

Quick and simple recipe. I added a packet of choc. chips plus a little more milk till the right consistency. I made them while my daughter was on her paper round and they were ready by the time she got back, she liked them.

These muffins were not great. Like another cook's comment about them being more like scones, I agree. They were very dense, even I used the right amount of baking powder. Next time I want to make muffins, I'll be looking for a different recipe.

Ok ok so this IS a basic recipe and was a tad 'dry', but all you need to do is add a touch more milk and spruce it up alittle to get a realllly nice result. I subsituted the butter for oil (same amount, simply because I couldn't be bothered to melt the butter!) and added half cream half milk (instead of all milk) I've tryed it with mushed up bananas and a dash of mixed spice, my hubby loved them!

Yuck. Dry, with a mealy texture, and no "muffin" taste. More like a scone. Lotsa butter n'jam required to eat these.

Not very muffin like - as the other reviews suggest - but thanks to the comments I got exactly what I wanted. Perfect for serving with a tea or just at any afternoon gathering!

These muffins were very dry. I thought they were more like scones. I'll probably eat them as scones, with cream and jam.

This is a great recipe. Be sure not to overmix. I serve them plain as well as "flavored". I had a recipe like this many years ago, but lost it. I'm glad I came across this one.

This is the best basic recipe. My first batch was chocolate chip and they were really tasty and a notch above the usual heavy and overly moist muffins I tend to make. I'm looking forward to making bacon muffins and maybe adding some cheese and chives. Who knows!

this muffin is on the dry side, in a great way. for dessert, add chocolate chips to the batter, without altering other ingredients. can also use skim milk with surprisingly good results if you're in a pinch or watching fat content.

I made this recipe with blueberries, the texture was good and it looked very appealing. I did crush about 2 tablespoons of berries and added it to the dough to make it blue "nice touch".

I too have little experience with baking and this was easy and quite tasty. I added dried cranberries and lemon zest an they turned out great

This recipe was very enjoyable and extremely easy to make. I don't have a lot of experience with baking, and this was one of the easiest and tastiest to make. 15 minutes into cooking I added a honey glaze on top and placed the muffins back into the oven. They turned out great, sweet and simple.

A great easy to follow recipe. I've added more sugar with the rasberries and blueberries. Everyone loved them.

I added a 300 gram bag of frozen raspberries and about 2 Tbls. lemon juice to the batter.Also added a bit more sugar.They turned out really tasty.

We made this blueberry recipe with blackberries. A great addition. We really enjoyed the fact that these muffins were not over-sweet and were a great compliment to our scrambled eggs this morning. We even sprinkled a little sugar on top just for fun! Enjoy!

Once I tasted the blueberry variation I realized that they could use some oomph, like lemon juice and zest or vanilla or almond extract. Nice texture, light and airy. I'll make this again but will add some flavoring.

Nice, easy recipe. Great when you're in an experimenting mood - you can add bacon, cheese, fruit, nuts, honey, and just about anything else. I would definitely make this again. NOTE: you may have to change the time/temp./salt/sugar if you're going to add other things to the mix.

what's not to like?? a simple, basic recipe that can be used in infinite variations. add spices to taste, experiment with fruit and nut combination. just the sort of recipe i like: one that gives me the basics and lets ME take over from there.

My muffins turned out too salty and gooey. Did I do something wrong?
