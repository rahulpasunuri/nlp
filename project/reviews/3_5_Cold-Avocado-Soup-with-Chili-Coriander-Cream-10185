Just so-so for me. I agree with the reviewer who called this bland. The chili coriander cream is a keeper (for some other preparation).

I loved this recipe- well, how it came out when I made it- I don't really measure. I probably used a lot more lime and less chicken broth in the soup part than the recipe called for, plus added more spices and cilantro. For the chili corriander cream, I skipped the sour cream and used only non-fat yogurt and didn't miss the sour cream at all (not to say it wouldn't be good with sour cream). It really needs the chili coriander cream to make the soup in my opinion. My boyfriend LOVED this as did my guests. Really easy to make, and still looks green the next day.

Not impressed. The chili coriander cream was amazing but the soup was way bland even after i added hot sauce!

I made this for a small dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. The men all asked for seconds. I did not have the processor problems mentioned in the previous review. The chili coriander cream is unremarkable on its own--in tasting during the prep phase, I wondered if the dish were going to be a mistake. It is actually wonderful in the soup and important to the dish, though it does not stand well alone. We had a bit of soup left over--this AM, 15 hours after prep, it is still a nice green. For guests, I wouldn't push it too far, but it seems that it can be done relatively early in the day. We LOVED this recipe!

Be careful making this soup. There is too much stuff for the food processor (mine, anyway). I had to process in batches because after the first go around the bowl was so full that the green soup came gushing out of the top and I was spattered and looked like I'd fallen into a vat of pond scum. What a mess! It tasted good, though.

This dish was an international pleaser at a dinner party I co-hosted for folks from all over the globe. A summer treat!
