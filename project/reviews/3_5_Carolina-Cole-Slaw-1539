I can't imagine how sweet this would have been with 6 T sugar! I reduced to 2 T, went light on oil, and used dijon mustard instead of dry mustard. Served with pulled pork and got requests for the recipe! Light and fresh.

Delicous! My Dad (cook of the family) made this slaw when I was growing up and I loved it. I despise mayonnaise and never eaten anyone else's. There are a couple post from NC that say this is "not authenic". Albeit I added carrots and didn't use a green pepper but the seasoning is. Keep in mind Carolina BBQ culture is very regional. My dad's from the Eastern part of the state where vinegar reigns supreme, including the slaw. My mom is Charlotte and likes both vinegar slaw and mayo slaw.

My husband has been wanting me to find a coleslaw like he had growing up in North Carolina (I'm a Yankee). I've tried so many recipes and the biggest problem was they all seemed too sweet and I wasn't shredding the cabbage the way he liked. So, I purchased a Cuisinart hand held food processor and used the slicing drum...perfect. I followed this recipe to the tee with one exception. I reduced the sugar to 3 tablespoons which was plenty. The results...he loved it!

Easy, fresh and healthy too! Didn't have celery seed and I didn't miss it. Added some grated carrots and a bit of OJ. Used a little less sugar and oil. Perfect complement to the pulled pork that took 9 hours to smoke!

I really like the clean, fresh flavors of this slaw. For my taste, I follow the recipe, but add about 3 tbsp or a dijon mustard. This is perfect on a pulled pork sandwich

I make this quite a bit - I cheat with the bagged pre-shredded cabbage and carrot mix. Add the dressing, and you have instant coleslaw! Great with pulled pork.

My husband and I are not big on mayo- based slaws, so this recipe is perfect. I replace the onion with shredded carotts and also add a thinly sliced red pepper for added color. Great for picnics since it is mayo-free!

a really good recipe that benefits from a touch of salt and a hint of spice, such as cayenne-but just a dusting. otherwise it is just fine as written. great with jerk chicken.

My boyfriend hates mayo - so I gave this cole slaw recipe a try. It is amazing! It compliments heavier BBQ dishes very nicely. I added toasted pine nuts, and cut down on the amount of onion.

Rating: 0
Liked the dressing a lot- lots of kick. If you a little like horseradish from time to time, you'll probably like this. I omitted the onion and bell pepper, and used matchsticked carrot instead. The leftovers were great on sandwiches (grilled tempeh, avocado, and slaw on rye, to be specific.)

Excellent. Took it to take to a fish fry, everybody liked it! I will make it again, soon.

At our house this has been renamed "Colorful Carolina Celeriac Cole Slaw" and is a regular dish so long as we have celeriac (celery root) from the garden. I shred half a large celeriac to go with half a large red cabbage and half a red onion, thinly sliced, for the given amount of dressing. The celeriac starts out white but quickly absorbs color from the cabbage, so that the dish winds up a lovely mix of reddish-purple shades. You can skip the bell pepper. Two-thirds of a cup of toasted walnut pieces or pine nuts is another good addition.

I was looking for a lighter alternative cole slaw since barbecue meals are heavy enough as is and I have found it. Tastes great, whether it's authentic or not.

I didn't rate because I make a big change: I use the pre-chopped coleslaw mix from the market and then I make the dressing exactly as is in the recipe. Very good and easy since there is no chopping! I make it all the time with slow cooked pork ribs and baked beans. It is my husband's fav meal.

I make this recipe at least once a week. I don't let the dressing cool and just pour it over the cabbage right off the heat. I use very little oil and sometimes I leave it out altogether. If I'm out of dry mustard I use a little dijon. My regular guests love it in any of the versions I make it. On the rare occaisions I have had left overs, it has kept well in the refridgerator.

Rating: 3
I have made this several times and have found the following changes work best- use cabbage only-any kind or a combo.Cut back the oil and sugar to 4T each(thanks to another reviewer). This gets better after sitting in the fridge at least overnight. I don't understand why its called Carolina cole slaw but its a good standby to have around in the fridge. It goes well with all kinds of things.

Made this for the second time yesterday. We absolutely love this recipe...especially since it has no mayo. Crispy, sweet, tangy, yummy with ribs, catfish. Did reduce the oil to 4T and the sugar to 4T and increased the celery seeds to 1-1/2 tsp. Highly recommend!

I've lived in NC all my life, and this is NOT our traditional slaw. Typically we eat "red slaw," which uses cider vinegar and pepper, similar to the marinade for the pork. We don't add the peppers or onions, either. I really wish people had a better appreciation of what regional southern food really is--polenta is not a substitute for grits; white slaw or this odd in-between will not do to replace red slaw. It saddens me that people will strive for authenticity when cooking from other cuisines, but the food of my childhood doesn't get the same respect.

I loved this coleslaw. I left out the bell pepper, but didn't change anything else and really really liked it. We had 6 people for a ribs dinner and everyone had seconds of the slaw.

I took the other review's advice and used only 4T sugar and 4T vegetable oil, and I opted for a red bell pepper rather than green. It was a delicious and light non- mayo side dish for the rest of our American fare that night. Everyone asked to take home leftovers of this dish. Perhaps next time try it with a bit more celery seed and substituting fresh chopped parsley for the bell pepper.

A step away from the soupy mayonaise cole slaw, refreshing and crisp

I followed the dressing recipe exactly and think it's terrific. I added red pepper, red onion, and two grated carrots for color. Poured the still-warm dressing on (my mother used to do that, especially with mayo on the still-warm potatoes for potato salad) and it's fabulous right away. I was lucky to find all the veggies fresh at the farmer's market, so the cole slaw looks, tastes, and feels super fresh and healthy. Great recipe!

Excellent! This was light and tasty although I disagree on reducing the sugar. I found the amount perfect. But then I'm not a health nut.

This was delicious! I followed some of the other suggestions and cut the sugar to 4T. and the oil to 2 - 4T. I used both red and green cabbage and would certainly do that again because of the beautiful color it added. I also cut the onion to 1/2. Wonderful slaw recipe.

I used 4T of sugar as well. It's enough. I didn't have Vidalia so used Spanish onion and less than called for and it was too heavy on the onion for me. Used celery salt instead of seeds because that's all I had. Used red pepper too. Next time I might put a bit of Vidalia & a bit of green onion in & get the seeds & see how it is.

Rating: 3
I too cut the sugar amount to 4 T and used rice wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I omitted the celery seeds as I didn't have any. Will use them the next time as I am sure they would enhance the flavor even more. I did add some toasted almond slices. I have added THIS recipe to my files!

Good, basic mayonnaise-free cole slaw. Didn't have time to "marinate" it, and I cut down the onion a bit. Very tasty. It's nice to have a simple, almost old-fashioned side dish for a change.

This cole slaw was delicious! An excellent summer alternative to heavy, mayonnaisse-based slaws. I plan to use only 4 tablespoons sugar in the future, though; in my opinion, 6 tablespoons made it a bit too sweet. Oh, and like the lady below, I used red bell peppers because they were an appetizing color contrast.

Rating: 3
I have made this recipe twice and it turned out a little better the first time. I had doubled the dressing the last time I made it and it made the slaw too runny. The first time I made it I used a red bell pepper and the slaw was much more appealing to the eye. I will keep this one around until I find a better one!

Sweet yet very tangy. I loved it. Also, I found it was good right away; if you don't have time to let it marinate, it's good enough to eat immediately.

A crunchy, lite and flavorful slaw - really good stuff! Never made homemade cole slaw before and this was a great recipe find; everyone loved it. As others, I used half red cabbage and half green and it was very visually appealling. You could mix and match any kind of crunchy shredded vegetable in this slaw and it would work. The dressing is very good, although I imagine you could decrease the sugar by a tablespoon or so and not miss it. But it's great as is!

My family is always dieting and the low carb suggestions were great. Loved the fact that there was no mayo or cream in recipe. Any shredded veggie combo would work well.

My family gave this high marks after converting it to low carb. I substituted 5 tablespoons Splenda for the sugar. I also added 1 tablespoon dijon mustard to up the mustard flavor. I had carrots on hand and used them in place of the green pepper. But, I think this slaw dressing would be good with many vegetables combinations.

This came out great. I used 1/2 red, 1/2 green cabbage and 1/2 red, 1/2 green pepper. Make sure to slice the onion very thin or it has a strong presence. Am wondering, the reviewer who said it was too oily- a mistake in measuring, perhaps?

I did not make this but I have a similar recipe that is wonderful. Spread the cabbage in a 13 x 9" pan and layer onion and bell pepper slices on top. Sprinkle evenly with 1 C sugar. Boil 1 c cider vinegar, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tsp celery seed, 1 tsp dry mustard, and 3/4 C oil and pour over veggies. Cover and marinate overnight, stir, and drain well before serving. Everyone raves about the flavor and texture. The onions taste as sweet as first love!

This was a wonderful suprise! We served it at a BBQ and everyone raved.

A flavorful but light dressing is the key to this recipe's success. To make things easy on myself, I used purchased prepared Broccoli slaw from BJ's Warehouse store (but you can often find it in larger supermarkets) and then added purple cabbage, Vidalia onion, and green pepper. This made for a very colorful presentation, along with a nice variety of textures. Highly recommend this recipe for its flavor and healthy attributes!

I did substitute carrot for the green pepper due to a dislike of green pepper by my husband.
