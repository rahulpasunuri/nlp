The recipe was fine... it was bland, but not bad. Probably wouldn't make it again.

One obvious thing to improve the flavor: add salt and pepper! I also replaced 1 TB of apple juice with cider vinegar and added some sugar (1 tsp?) to add flavor and sharpness. I pounded the carraway seed in a mortar and pestle to increase the flavor. I grated the carrots, which worked fine. Next time I'll grate the apple too because they stood out to much. I served it right away and there weren't enough leftovers to see if the flavor improved! This was popular with all ages.

I made this exactly as it reads, but it was BLAND! I added more lemon juice and some cider vinegar so it would be palatable. I finally sauted the whole salad with some chopped red onion and it was actually pretty good that way.

The beauty of the recipe is the flavor combinations work well. Savoy cabbage is flavorful and not overpowering. The dressing needs more seasoning than is called for, however, I added a few raisins and it drew out more of the caraway flavor and added to the contrast of sweet and savory.
