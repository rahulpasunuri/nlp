I run across recipes that belong under the heading "Who on earth eats this?", and this recipe falls at the top of that list. This is by far one of the oddest concoctions I have run across. Don t waste your time. I'm surprised it made it out of the test kitchen and into print.

This came out quite good, though it does take time. I ended up serving it not as a sandwhich because the ingredients were too heavy/watery for the bread. I just piled the carrots on top of the lettuce, and put the hummus on top of the carrots. I served the toast on the side. My husband and I really liked it and are planning to make it again. One thing--we didn't think it needed the sauce (garlic, oil, lime juice, cumin seeds) because the veggies were well-seasoned and moist without it. I'll save myself that step next time!

I love hummus and am always looking for new ways to incorporate it. But soggy lettuce... yuck! For this sandwich, try just a little dressing on the lettuce allow it to wilt and then put it on your sandwich. Much tastier.

I just want to know if the recipe is good - and skip the bio-chemistry lesson.

I agree with Peter from NY.... Why bother.

WWhat a dumb, time-consuming recipe for a SANDWICH, which should be a quick and easy.

Plastic wraps whould never be allowed to come in contact with food at any time, but Polyvinylchloride wraps are the ones to avoid because of chemical leaching. Polyehtylene wraps, e.g GLAD, are infinitely preferable. I would think parchmment paper may be the way to go with this recipe, however.

This was a wonderful change from the usual veggie sandwich! I would like to comment on the review from Cook from Ottawa 1/14/03 yes wrapped and plastic then in foil... you never want the foil to touch your food any professional will tell you that (and don't worry about the plastic wrap it won't melt as long as the foil is on it.) The reason for this being that the foil can react to acids in some foods and make some sensitive ppl very ill.

Using plastic wrap nade of polyurethene is much safer than using the other type of plastic wrap (I forget what it's made of, but they're both labeled) in terms of toxins leaching out. There was an interesting Consumer Reports article about that a year or two ago.

Some people don't want to cook food with plastic wrap (chemical leaching) so an alternative for braising veggies is to cover with buttered waxed or parchment paper, then with foil.

In response to covering the lettuce with plastic wrap first and then foil....whenever I had leftover stuffing when making turkey, it always dried out when I put the remaining in a dish and put it in the oven. My Mom taught me to cover it FIRST with plastic wrap, then foil. It keeps the moisture in and the plastic does not melt or burn. I haven't made this recipe but they probably want to keep the lettuce moist, it may dry out otherwise.

Am I missing something: "cover with plastic wrap and then foil, roast for 35 min". Roast with plastic wrap on it? Maybe they mean soak until tender...
