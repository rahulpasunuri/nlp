This is really good. My daughter, when I gave her a taste, said "give me more!". I do think that mayo and sour cream can be cut down. It is way too much!

Don't forget to add some salt and pepper... otherwise may be a bit bland. Does anyone know what the vinegar does? Seems like such a small amount that it may be unnecessary...

I made this in the food processor effortlessly. It turned out beautiful - not brown. Definitely will make again.

These other folks have been eating wildly more flavorful deviled eggs than I grew up with! I took this recipe, made as is, to a Christmas party and it was devoured by a group of 12. Only one left standing and I ate it. Everyone commented on how 'flavorful' it was without being overwhelming. Given its simplicity to make, and the comments of the dinner guests, I highly recommend it.

My guests said they were good, but I think they were just being nice! I agree with other reviewers -- these are pretty bland. Maybe adding mustard would help. I did not have tomatoes in oil so I substitued re-hydrated sun-dried tomatoes. The color they imparted to the yolk mixture was rather unappetizing. I don't know if that would happen with the oil-packed variety or not.

This recipe was great! Double it and added dijon mustard to the mix but everyone loved it on Mother's Day. A keeper!

I did not like this recipe. It sounded good but was too overwhelmed with sun-dried tomato taste and it just wasn't very good.

Pretty bland - not enough zing.

The Sun Dried Tomatoes add a wonderful flavor to this classic. I'll use this as my standard deviled egg recipe now - very tasty..

I made these for a party and they quickly disappeared. Perhaps I didn't mound the filling enough, but I found that this recipe filled 10 eggs.

I made these for Easter and they were great! Very tasty with a subtle blend of flavors.

I used a simple deviled egg reciepe, 1/4 c. light mayo, 1 tsp. vinegar, 1tsp. mustard salt and pepper and then added the sun-dried tomatos. Turned out very good. Nice change from the norm.
