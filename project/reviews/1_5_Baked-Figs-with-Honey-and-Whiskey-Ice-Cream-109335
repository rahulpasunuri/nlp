I had been planning on making this recipe since fig season a year ago and I was so dissapointed! The ice cream was lumpy and didn't taste sweet at all and the figs were just so-so. It sounded like it would be delicious but it was just bland and uneatable.

The honey whiskey ice cream is fairly laborious. I wouldn't really mind except that it doesn't end up really tasting like anything but honey. You'd probably be better off to add a shot of whiskey to the warm figs and serve them with a good vanilla ice cream (homemade or not). Also, if you are going to make this, you should know that the alcohol content makes the ice cream slow to freeze.

If you look at the bottom of the ingredients list, you will see BAKED FIGS - it is a link you can click onto - then you will see the recipe for making the baked figs. Hope this was helpful.
