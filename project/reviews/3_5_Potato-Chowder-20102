Loved it. Next time I'll double the ingredients. I used chicken stock instead of water. And I made 4 strips of bacon :). I mixed 1/4 of fresh milk with the flour and add 1/4 of heavy cream. But next time I'll use less salt.

After re-trying this soup the next day and reading the other reviews, I would like to add an addendum to my previous review: First--the soup is marginally better the next day, but still not worth making again. Second--I should know by now that it's essential to read the reviews before making the recipe. Had I done that, I would have realized that most people who gave this recipe good reviews actually made something that hardly resembled the original recipe. So, like a previous person asked, PLEASE review the recipe as (or close to) it's printed. Half the reviewers made the original recipe unrecognizable. I'm sure it WAS good with all the changes they made. I might have liked it then, too.

I would have to say that this soup is thoroughly mediocre. I probably wouldn't make it again, and in retrospect, I'm not sure why I made it in the first place, because if you read the recipe, it just doesn't make much sense. For example--boiling the vegetables in water after sauteeing a paltry amount of aromatics just doesn't make for a very flavorful soup. The soup is overly sweet and overall bland. Perhaps I should give up my search for a "healthy" chowder.

Yummy! I substituted the water for low sodium chicken broth. I also used peppered bacon which gave it a little kick. I will absolutely make this again :)

This was terrific! I did make two very small changes: I substited 1/4 cup of heavy cream for 1/4 cup of the milk, and I used my stick blender to partially puree the finsihed soup. Delicious!

A classic. This is a favorite at our house. My toddler even loves it. This is a part of our regular rotation now.

Wonderful recipe. I substituted chicken broth for the water, but otherwise used as written. I quadrupled the recipe for an event (easily done and worked beautifully) and it got rave reviews. I cook a lot and will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. I used about 8 ounces of sliced flank steak instead of bacon to make the soup a fuller main dish and I substituted some beef broth for the water to add flavor.

this was a good base recipe to start with. i didn't have any carrots, so i used extra onions as well as two cobs of fresh corn. i boiled potatoes in chicken broth that i let reduce, and added the milk at the end. I also added half a jar of cheeze wiz i'd had leftover from making broccli and cheese. very good!

It is really discouraging when looking at the ratings of a recipe, you find that the ratings do not reflect the recipe as printed, but instead rate the chef's "substitutions". If you have to substitute the majority of ingredients, it doesn't rate 3-4 forks! Please rate the recipe as printed, and THEN add what you did to make it better.

Since leeks were available at the farmers' market, I substituted them for the onions, using a total of 8 leeks, well washed and thinly sliced (white parts only). I made other substitutions as well, replacing the water with chicken stock, and omitting the carrots altogether, using more potatoes and leeks instead. I also used 1/4 cup heavy cream in place of the same amount of milk. I found this needed to simmer for longer than the 8 to 10 minutes the recipe recommends--up to 25 minutes in fact for the vegetables to become tender and the flavors to build. Use finely minced fresh parsley in place of the dried stuff the recipe calls for and add some finely chopped fresh chives just before serving. This was a huge hit with my husband, a big potato chowder fan. Next time I'll double the recipe, since reheated this soup is even better.

I used chicken istead of bacon. Added a little garlic, some shredded zucchini and used 1 cup of whipping cream as a substitute for 1 of the cups of milk. It was delicious. I think it would have been even better if I had used the bacon. My family loved it though. Even my husband, who is not a chowder lover.

This was an easy and very quick recipe. I think it's the type you can change or add things too. I added more bacon (yummy) and 3 tablespoons of diced green chiles. A little southwestern- YUM! This is a keeper and a good starter recipe. I'll make it again!!

Quick and easy to make.... although I did mistakenly put loose peppermint tea in instead of parsley in my rush. It actually gave it a really neat set of flavours, and I would recommend trying it if you really like mint flavours!!

This was an extremely good basic potato chowder recipe. Being an impoverished college student w/ no bacon, I omitted it, and cooked the onions in butter. I also added a little garlic, instead of the sage. Additionally, I increased the flour by 1-2 tablespoons, and mashed some of the potatoes w/ a fork to thicken the soup. Will definitely make again!

this was just the kind of recipe i was looking for.. i did make a couple changes, such as chicken broth instead of water, added canned corn (drained),used evaporated milk along with the milk, you can also add cooked chicken - cut in bite sized chunks..

This recipe was so-so. It wasn't bad, but I didn't love it. I added more flour to thicken the soup which made it more chowder-like. I think I'll play with it a little more and give it another chance.

Yum! Next time I would increase the flour to 1/4 cup and add it after wilting the onion to make a roux, then add water (I used broth). This would make a thicker chowder. Alternatively, I would puree about half of the vegetables to thicken the recipe. We topped it with shredded cheddar cheese, sliced green onion and bacon. Delish.

This is a wonderful hearty soup. I added some celery and used fresh parsely instead of dried. This would also make an excellent clam chowder with the addition of clams. Great with some warm sourdough bread.

Very good for a cold February day, but I did make a few changes. Not having any carrots, and since celery is somewhat of a standard item in chowder, I made a substitution. I chopped the raw bacon and added the onion and celery to the pot before it was quite finished cooking. I wanted to cook the bacon in with the rest of the chowder, and since cooking it with the vegetables kind of precluded removing it, I did. I substituted light cream for 1/2 cup of the milk and added a dollop of cooking Sherry. My husband loved it and so did I.

A great soup that can be prepared in a flash. I also used chicken broth for more flavor, and in place of the milk I used soy "milk". Don't use the fat free version though! The result was a rich, creamy soup which no one would suspect was made with soy! For a little more pizzaz add lots of fresh ground black pepper!

I added a leek and a stalk of celery chopped right befor the onion was transparent. I also added 2 cups of low sodium, fat free chicken broth to that mixture, let it boil and then added the remaining vegetables. I used rosemary instead of sage and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. This was one of the best potato chowders I have ever made or eaten. Wow, my boyfriend finished the whole pot.

I boiled the vegetables in water and chicken bouillon cubes, plus added 1 stalk chopped celery and 1 chopped and cleaned leek to the sauteed onions. This recipe was "to die for" and all of my friends are making it by the dutch oven full!
