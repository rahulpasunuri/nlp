Delicious! I had no problem with the custard tasting too vinegary. For those that did I'm guessing they didn't let the vinegar reduce down enough. My only complaint is I didn't like the method of pressing the dough into the pan. It made the butter melt from the heat of my hands, and so the crust had more of a cakelike consistency than a flaky one. Next time I would roll it out to ensure the chunks of butter stay cold. Although I didn't hear any complaints from my guests, who all loved it!

Made for July 4th and it was fantastic. Added sliced white nectarines around the edge & glazed all the fruit - beautiful and delicious.

Very unique! The vinegar really gives this a delightful twist, you experience one flavor and then another soon after! While making the custard it will take a few minutes for it to thicken, don't give up, mine looked soupy at first. Be sure to make your crust sides very thick and refridgerate for long enough or your sides won't hold up. Used blueberries and raspberries and coated them with raspberry preserves before I put them on the top, created a nice gloss. (heat preserves for a few seconds to thin out first)

I was so intimidated when m b'day buddy at work said she wanted a berry tart for her b'day. They seem so hard to make. Yet, this recipe is really easy and absolutely delicious. I made two tarts and there was not one crumb left!

Loved this tart! Flawless, classic pastry crust and the custard was a real hit as well. Only change I might do to it is next time I'd reduce the balsamic vinegar by about half--the flavor was great and interesting but I'm not sure I need to repeat it, haha. But overall it was fantastic and a real hit. How can you not impress with a topping like that?!

This tart was sooo good! I'm a major sucker for a lemon curd tart but wanted something a little different and this was fantastic! My husband who hates vinegar had 2 pieces without blinking an eye. For an extra special glossy presentation you can melt a little apricot jam with a drop of water and using a pastry brush glaze the fruit. It gives it just that little extra special resentation!

I only made the custard, but it is outrageously good. I served it over angel food cake, with a topping of sweetened Bing cherries steeped in just a touch more balsamic. SOOOO good.

I couldn't find white balsamic vinegar at Whole Foods, but they did have white balsamic "condiment" which seemed like the balsamic vinegar/sugar reduction part of the recipe. So I used 1/4 cup of it, and since it was a bit tart, I added another 1/4 cup sugar which left the taste of the balsamic but cut the edge just enough. I heated it, then continued on with the recipe - adding the water and butter. It was brilliant! Everything came out great - and the presentation was beautiful. Will definitely make again.

I made this last night for a dinner party - and it was INCREDIBLE! I wouldn't change a thing and agree with the other reviewers....the white balsamic gives it such a unique and exceptional taste. Will definetly make again.

I made this recipe once for a BBQ and showed the picture to my family. Ever since then, they always specially request it when there's even a CHANCE of something tasty. It's amazing delicious and I highly suggest it!

The custard was delicious. I didn't strain it and didn't notice any egg white bits. I used all strawberries. My crust was too thick and kind of crumbly--maybe I didn't mix it enough in the processor, and I think I should have baked it a little bit longer. Will try to remedy that next time. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great and super easy recipe! The only thing I'd change is I'd add a little more vanilla to the crust. Followed all directions and it was easy and got rave reviews and also a beautiful presentation. For fun I tried using a white balsimic FIG vinegar - tasted great! Not much of a fig taste so not sure if it made much of a difference either way , but I had it so I tried it. I'm making it again today using regular white bals. vinegar so we'llsee.

I agree with many other reviews. This is excellent! My family loved it. My tips are to watch the crust when it is baking. I had to lower the temp for the last few minutes, as the edges were browning too quickly. Secondly, for ease of preparation to serving, I would recommend using a regular pie pan versus the springform, unless you are a real pro. I found it too difficult to maintain presentation with the softness of the custard--even after chilling overnight. But an AWESOME recipe! Do NOT omit the white balsamic vinegar. It elevates this tart above the traditional versions we have all had.

Absolutely fantastic! I don't often review the recipes I make but this one was so good I had to let people know! It was beautiful - perfect for our 4th of July get-together. The tart balsamic custard was absolutely divine. The crust did not come out well for me because I don't have a food processor. Ended up scrapping that, and using store bought crust - but it was still delicious. There was not a single scrap left! Will make this one again and again.

This recipe is so great! Made it last year, and just yesterday for our annual July 4th party. It is a huge hit, and one of the first desserts to go! The custard is delightfully tangy and the fresh fruit placement on top is always so fun. I always strain the custard through a fine sieve, because despite my best efforts, I always end up with tiny bits of egg white solids---and I'm super particular!

I entered this recipe in a dessert contest and won (hands down!). The basalmic vinegar really gives it a complementary tartness and everyone loved it. I made another one for my family when I got home that evening. Not to difficult to make.

I have loved custard desserts in the past but have never attempted one. Though this had such good reviews, I was worried about the balsamic taste so I made another vanilla custard at the same time. Accidentally overbaked the crust so I tossed it and we just served the custard and fruit over Nilla Wafers. Party-wide, all but one person preferred this over the vanilla custard. Making this was so much easier than I thought it would be. How can I triple vote on "Would you make it again?" Delicious!

Absolutely wonderful, impressive yet simple dessert. I have made it 3 times and every time it is a crowd pleaser. Unless you are a very particular chef, I would not worry about straining the custard.

BEST custard recipe I have ever made! The crust was buttery and delicious, but the real star is the custard. The vinegar provides this perfect tartness that complements the buttery crust and fresh fruit. I am about to make it again, but this time I am going to add just a touch of almond extract to the crust and see how that works.

Wow! This was superb !! One of the best fruit custard tart recipes !! The flavor and texture of the custard and the crust were divine. Just like previous reviewers, it took me three times as long as stated to reduce the vinegar and a bit longer to thicken the custard. I also weighted the crust with pie weights for the first half of baking and then removed them for the second half. I made the red and blue berry star design on top but any fruit would do.

Rating: 4
Delicious - this was a huge hit at our bbq! The first bite was fairly tangy, but then I was used to the tartness and it complimented the fruit very well. I, too, found that some of the projected times were a little on the short side, but only by a few minutes. Also, I didn't strain the custard and had no problems with how it turned out.

I made this with just strawberries and it was fabulous. I also was out of white balsamic vinegar, so I used champagne vinegar instead. The custard was delicious and the crust perfect. It looked beautiful and was a perfect dish for a warm May afternoon. I will definitely make this again and again.

Very easy to make and the custard has an awesome tangy aftertaste. Not sure why you reduce the vinager just to add more water back? so i sort of skipped that step... i just added less water

I've made this a number of times and it is always something that meets with raves from everyone. This time I had to make it without the raspberries as the woman ahead of me bought out the last of them in the only supermarket still open in Marblehead. But it was still as wonderful as ever. All the kids loved it, too, and I saw no reason to mention it had vinegar as an ingredient! It is becoming my 4th of July classic.

Delicious and perfect for a Fourth of July celebration! I was nervous about the tart crust (it looked dry and crumbly after I baked it), but after sitting for a few hours, the dish came together perfectly. Would definitely make again.

Scrumptious - one of the best desserts I've ever had! My guests raved about it. I'd agree with an earlier comment though that some of the cooking times are off - for e.g., it took me a much longer time to thicken the custard. Also, I forgot chill the crust for 1 hour before cooking it, and it still came out perfect (did not fall apart)!

I was nervous about making the custard, but it came out excellently. A huge hit at my Independence Day party!

Absolutely delicious. Took some time to make, nothing crazy, tho. The custard was simple. The only thing I'd comment on are the times the recipe has given. It didn't take me 3 minutes to reduce the vinegar... and it sure didn't take me a minute to thicken the custard. I actually measured my reduced vinegar and got exactly 1/4cup after oh i dont know... a good 5 or 6 minutes. It came out spectacular. The slight tartness of the vinegar with the natural sweetness of the berries are awesome. Nothing is more delicious than berries with balsamic vinegar.

I see that I'm in the minority here, but I found the flavor of this tart to be VERY unpleasant. On the plus side, the dessert was beautiful & everyone admired the presentation, the crust had a rich, buttery flavor & the custard set-up nicely. I just can't get over the unpleasantly tart, vinegar taste of the custard. If I want a tart custard, I will flavor it with lemon; otherwise I'd just stick with a rich, vanilla custard for this tart.

I haven't tried this yet, so I can't rate it. But as a suggestion to those who had trouble with the crust sticking - try cutting a round of parchment paper and placing it in the bottom of your pan before baking the crust. It will release much easier that way.

This tart is AMAZING and EASY!!! I used the crust from the Summer Berry Mint Cream Tart recipe (equally amazing and the crust is to die for) instead of the crust that the recipe calls for. This recipe was stellar and I can't wait to make it again!

I made this for the 4th. Did not use the rasberries just strawberries and blueberries. Still turned out very pretty. Only thing I would change would be to spray bottom of tart pan to avoid sticking. A little time consuming but well worth it.

Perfect dessert, great and incredibly easy crust, plus the white balsamic is a lovely change. Didn't strain the custard, and only used blueberries, fabulous.

This is sooo good - I'm enjoying leftovers for lunch now. Trader Joe's carries the white balsamic vinegar for only $1.99. The only step I would skip next time would be straining the custard. It gooped up in the strainer, so I scooped it out and used it as is, with no discernable difference. Yum!

Great Recipe. Not only is the flavor great but the display as well. Our friends thoroughly enjoyed this dessert.

This is the first tart I have ever made. I wanted to try something different for this holiday. I found it very easy to make. I thought the vinegar gave it a nice "tangy" taste. The fruit gave it the sweetness that it needed. The only problem I had was that I don't think I boiled the custard long enough. I boiled till it bubbled but I think the next time I make it I will let it bubble a little longer. It wasn't a firm enough custard like the picture that was provided. But none the less it was a hit, and it was delicious. You learn by doing!! Thank you!!

I have made this recipe twice. It is easy to do and it gets rave reviews. My husband is not a big fan of vinegar, so this was a risk for me. He loves it. Last time he had more than anyone else. It is sweet and tangy at the same time. Just make sure you use a good quality balsamic vinegar. It really does make a difference

Best. Tart. EVER! I love it, love it, love it; it's easy to put together and has never failed to be a hit. It's the right note of tart and sweet, and even philistine doubters at the office who wrinkled their noses at the word "vanilla" in connection to a dessert scarfed it down and begged for the recipe!

I have made this recipe about 10 times now. EVERYONE loves it. While in England I made it for friends, one of whom dislikes most desserts and only eats trifle and even he loved it! The only thing I do that isn't in the recipe is that I sprinkle a little sugar and a splash of orange juice on the fruit and leave it in the fridge overnight or for a few hours. Or course not with the raspberries. I also make in a flag shape. Flags...stars..it's always a hit.

What did I do wrong? I tried to make sure that the vinegar was reduced to half its original volume, but perhaps I did not reduce enough? I don't know... The custard turned out really relaly REALLY tart, very "vinegary." Difficult to eat.

This was my first tart and it was fabulous, even though I cheated and used a purchased graham-cracker crust. I found the balsamic a tiny bit too strong (maybe I didn't use enough fruit) and sprinkled the fruit with a little sugar before serving. I topped with kiwi, strawberry, and blackberry and it was fabulous!

This tart is fabulous and not too sweet (thanks to the balsamic reduction). When I first made the custard, it looked "gummy" and I was tentative, but it spreads thinly over the equally yummy shortbread-like crust. It is great and I look forward to trying this recipe again with other fruits or no fruit at all.

My sister and I made this for the 4th of July for our families and it was fabulous. We used a pre-made crust and didn't have raspberries, but it was still great. The custard is creamy and not too sour tasting. I am planning on making it again for a picnic this weekend.
