The chip recipe uses exactly the same method my English Mum taught me, basically frying the potatoes slowly in smaller batches to allow them to cook through, then raising the temperature and frying again right before you eat them, to crisp them up. The type of potato you use makes a difference, I like the big, starchy white ones that are sold here as baking potatoes. They cook faster and crispier than red skinned or Yukon golds. The fish recipe is good too, it was easy and yummy. Used snapper.

this recipe is the best i've ever tasted (and i've traveled a LOT). the only change i made is i use pangasius (sometimes called swai) which is a lot cheaper and everyone always wants to know what it was! :)

After checking other recommendations, To start, I am using a Breville BDF600XL Fryer - I soaked the peeled and cut potatoes in cold water over night (thanks to A Cook from New York City), blotted very dry before frying and as suggested by Silver Springs - and coated with the batter used for the fish - most excellent french fries! Maybe add a minute to the first cooking, and frying the potatoes twice is absolutely necessary - otherwise don't bother. Sprinkled the fish with a little cayenne with the salt and pepper. Be sure to flour and coat the fish at the last minute and drip off extra! Made batter that was suggested by a Cook from Mid-Coast Maine. My fish still stuck to the basket if I didn't move them around mid way through. Also, make your own fresh tartar sauce (Bon Appetite 1/99) is excellent!

Used tilapia because my family prefers it. Batter was easy and delicious. Didn't make the chips - cheated and used frozen, which were great.

I like pollock...a little more flavorful, to my taste, and less expensive to boot. It's what my fish store, which also is a restaurant, uses for their fish and chips, and I concur. Be sure the potatoes, after the first fry, are really cooled off, in fact put them in the fridge on a sheet pan, and they'll be real crispy on the outside, and soft and delicious on the inside. One negative reviewer doesn't know how to cook!

The fish came out beautifully. So simple, yet delish. I par-boil my potatoes for 4 minutes, and drain, before deep-frying. I will try the double-fry another time!

too much work for little results. batter is not that tasty and makes a big mess..double fry potatoes on ly make the soggy and brown

Quick and easy. Great for a week time meal. I only did the fish, not the chips. I used the cod fillets from Costco, and the coating was perfect. Might add some cayenne to the batter next time. Advice: serve immediately, or put on paper towel in warm (but off) oven. I put mine on parchment paper in a 350 degree oven and the bottoms got all soggy. Though my husband still ate every dang bit of that shell and fish.

Thought I could get away without the double fry on the chips, but it is so much better if you do it. I'm convinced.

I would make this again for sure! The only problem is that I don't have a deep fryer so I used a small pot on the stove. Maybe I didn't have enough oil so they stuck to the bottom and some of the batter came off. Overall everyone loved them.

Made the recipe exactly as written. Don't bother with the double-fried chips  they were just OK, not worth the time and effort required. The fish, on the other hand, was terrific: the batter was light and puffed up beautifully and the fish was moist and flavorful. My teenage son, not a fish eater, pronounced it not bad  high praise indeed, given the source. The low, two-fork rating addresses the mediocre chips  the fish, by itself, deserves four.

super easy and good.

Delicious! Crispy light batter that allows the fresh fish to shine. Make sure to allow excess batter to drip off of fish before placing in the oil; that ensures that the coating isn't too overwhelming and thick. The fries were okay, but next time I will order them from a chip shop and make the fish myself. This reciep for the fish is a keeper! Very British AND delicious and my children gave it a big thumbs up too...

I cheated and bought "chips" from the pizza place across the street, partly out of lazyness, and partly because they use fresh spuds and make VERY yummy fries. I also added cumin to the flour to give the batter a nice flavor. Absolutely delicious.

The beer adds a nice flavour to the batter. Remember to season the fish well, else it can be a bit bland. And be sure to choose thick, chunky fish fillets, as the batter puffs up quite a bit during cooking and can 'overpower' thin fish fillets.

Rating: 4
this is an excellent recipe. Easy and quick. The fish came out perfectly crisp and not at all oily. The fries were also excellent. Crispy and tender. I made a lemon aioli to replace the traditional tartar sauce. I had also battered and fried 4 jumbo shrimp. They may have been even better than the fish. As for the comment about the fries not being good because they are not frozen prior to the second frying ... I did it both ways, and it made no difference.

Outstanding. My 7 year old even loved it. I used the freshest of wild caught pollock. I did not measure the beer - did it by feel to get a batter that was not too thick and not too thin. Used a Hacker-Pschorr Weiss beer and it was divine.

The batter was very think and chewy, the flavors were all perfect, just too much batter stuck to the fish!

Skipped making the fries because I could tell from the recipe that they wouldn't come out right. To make actually good fries, you have to freeze them after the first frying for at least an hour, then fry them again. . . The fish, however, was incredible! The batter was perfect, the frying time was perfect. I used a deep fryer that only goes up to 375Ú, but at that temperature, at 5 minutes, it was perfectly cooked. I would definitely make this again.

Made just the fish (halibut). It was incredibly easy and fast - I think the whole process took 15 minutes from start to finish. Be sure to season the fish before putting it in the batter (I forgot and missed it.)

I made this recipe tonight with my boyfriend and it was amazing. If you are a fan of authentic English Fish and Chips I'd definitely recommend this batter mix. I only have to take issue with the chips portion, ours were very dried out at the end. This was the first time we have tried to make this so there was probably a lot of down time for the chips to dry out in the oven. Otherwise, excellent recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe. Unfortunately our deep fryer is pretty small, so it requires some dancing around to get it all done.

I agree fully with the reviewer below: I began making this recipe absolutely positive that mine would turn out sub-par. It DIDN'T! It was great! My dinner guests decided it was the best fish they'd had this side of the pond! Just like fish from a chippy. My only addition to the list of ingredients is PLENTY of paper towels or brown craft paper - you're going to need it for all the draining. Also, having spent my college years waiting tables at Balthazar here in NYC, I offer the following advice in regard to the chips: after cutting Idaho potatoes, transfer fries to a large bowl, cover with water and refrigerate for AT LEAST 12 hours. Overnight is ideal. 20 minutes before frying, drain fries and dry them on paper towels. I swear by peanut oil. The first fry should be at 370 F, 3 batches, 3 minutes per batch, returning to 370 between batches. The second fry should be at 380 F, 2 batches for 3.5 minutes per batch or until golden brown, returning the oil to 380 between batches. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with sea salt. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I lacked confidence that this would turn out well, but it did! My partner said the fish was "restaurant quality". However, the recipe is messy and time consuming, so I will make this again, but not frequently.

i made this recipe once before and am makng again tonight. It was absolutely fantastic, fish and potatoes both. The only draw back is the large amount of oil and the clean up afterwards, other than that it is a very good recipe. As I recall I didn't use quite as much oil and used Michelob for the beer, as that is what i had on hand.

Fantastic. Authentic. Easy. I used to use food service batter mix from NIFDA, which I purchased in Pismo Beach, CA. Now I'm in Texas and have no batter mix. This recipe beats the NIFDA, and I don't know where you can live that doesn't have beer and flour! As said earlier, open beer and let sit, make batter 1 hr before using. Oil to temp, FRY! Glad this was my first attempt at replacing NIFDA batter mix. No worries now.

Easy and fantastic. No more soggy fish and chips from a greasy spoon for us... Made it with tilapia and everyone loved it, including my picky toddler. Can't rate the chips as I made my usual french fries in the fryer but the fish was a hit.

This recipe is great and simple - and pretty much foolproof! I've made it a few times and have started playing with it - I switch out a little of the flour for cornmeal & I add salt, pepper & cayenne to the mixture.

Rates very well against the best chip shop fish and chips. Jennifer from Arizona's brother-in-law is far more discerning about British food than she obviously is!

This turned out very good, however, due to likely user error with the deep fryer (Phillips), I am certain it could have been better. The batter was excellent though I did not have time to let it settle out as suggested. Any suggestions as to keeping the battered fish from immediately becoming one with the fryer basket? Next time I believe much hotter fryer and oil may work. Is altitude an issue with deep fryers? The double fried chips worked fine.

This fish and chips recipe was a hit with my family. It's a bit time consuming but the tartar sauce is awesome. I followed it to a T and I would suggest more dill pickle for a less mayonaise-y taste.

This was a big hit with my sister and brother-in-law (he loves British food, go figure). It's a bit time-consuming, but worth it! Serve with a nice ale and you've got a dinner worth having guests to.

The fish batter was excellent: I used Newcastle & it had a perfect malt-y taste. I recommend using slightly less flour in the batter than called for, as some other reviewers mentioned, or it might be a bit on the goopy side. The chips portion of this recipe was less successful for me; they were fine (and a perfectly good starting point if you, like me, are not experienced with frying temperatures and times) but they were not quite as revelatory as the fish.

For an extra kick try lemon juice in the fish befor you batter it. perch is a small lake fish, very flaky and good, try it!

The crispy, light coating is unbelievabley easy to achieve and tasty. I did not even attempt the fries. This dish is a man-pleaser for sure.

I made this recipe with Gordon Biersch Marzen beer. Who could believe that something so tasty and crunchy could be so easy to make from just beer and flour. Definitely compares with fish & chips I've had in the UK. Took the advice to open the beer ahead of time and let it come to room temp then let the batter sit for 1 hour. Batter was not too thick, and came out crunchy and golden when cooked. Didn't bother making the fries, just used oven fries. A very, very simple and tasty recipe.

I'm rating only the batter portion of this recipe -- it was *perfect*. Made oven fries, much easier. Used fresh seabass a friend had caught -- heaven!

I've made this twice now and both times the fish was excellent- crunchy and flaky- but the chips turned out the opposite of crunchy. Perhaps I didn't use the right potatoes as it seems to me that the recipe is perfect. I made a tartare sauce to go with it.

It truly is restaurant quality. It is the best fried cod I have had since Ireland. Great. I added salt and pepper to the flour I dredged the fish in as well.

Wow! This was simply amazing!!! One of the best, if not the best, fish I have ever had. We also made the chips which were great as well. I think the person (S) who had the problem with the inside being soft did not cook hers/his at the right temp or for long enough...ours was Perfect! Crisp on the outside and golden and tender flaky fish on the inside...will make many more times

Four forks all the way - this is the resturant-style battered fish you're looking for! These puppies are a keeper! Oh, as far as the potatoes go - too much hassle - would rather make some oven fries or even go for the frozen Gordon Biersh!

The search goes on for the perfect batter for fish. Like the cook from South Portland Maine, my husband likes batter that is well cooked and not gooey on the inside. Maybe I didn't cook the fish quite long enough or maybe it was the recipe but the batter was a little thick and a little gooey on the inside. Maybe I'll try Mid-coast Maine's suggestions to make a slightly thinner batter.

To the cook from New York, french fries must be fried two times to achieve the desired outer crispness, inner tenderness, and slight puff. Napoleons's chef discovered the recipe accidentally. Napoleon was late to arrive for dinner one night. Because the telephone was not yet invented, he could not call his chef to tell him to delay dinner. Well, the chef fried the potatoes hours before the emperor arrived and they just sat in the kitchen getting cold. When Napolean arrived, the chef reheated the potatoes in the hot oil and, voila! Puffed and tender French fries were born. If you only fry them one time, they will have a dense, raw taste.

I've made this batter for years, but always with a beer that has been opened and come to room temp. Then mixed with equal measure of flour and stirred, covered and let sit in a warm place for several hours (make in the morning, put on top of the frig, and have for dinner). That batter is thin and crisy -- better, I think. Serving with crispy oven fries helps with the timing issue.

This recipe sounds good, but time consuming. Does anyone think that this dish would turn out okay if a deep fryer was used (one without a temperature gauge). What if I just deep fried the potatoes once opposed to twice as the recipe calls? Thanks!
