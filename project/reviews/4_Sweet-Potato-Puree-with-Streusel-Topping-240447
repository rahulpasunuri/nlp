I cut the sugar and butter by half and it was still plenty-rich. Decadent, declicious, and easy.

I made this for along with a Turkey dinner and everyone loved it and wanted my recipe. It was delicious.

This recipe is delicious and perfect to make ahead for a meal. I used a food processor to make the potatos silky smooth. Easy recipe and a big hit!

I thought this turned out very nice but sweet. Could have been my fault as I think I added too much streusel and had cut back the potatoes a bit. otherwise, very nice and fluffy/smooth. Easy to make. No need to cut the potatoes in half - they peel super easy after taking out of the oven.

This was the star of the meal - and believe me the rest was really really good!

Super easy and turned out great. I added some toasted pecans to the crumble and I loved the result.

I'm not happy the recipe has been changed since I made it a few years ago! It used to call for orange rind in the sweet potato puree, cinnamon and nuts in the streusel, as well as some ground chile powder for a bit of a kick. Hopefully I'm remembering everything correctly and can recreate it in the next few hours! It's one of those recipes that is slightly different but everyone loves, and is not so out of the ordinary that broiled marshmallow lovers turn up their noses. For anyone wanting to make this, I would highly recommend at least adding some orange rind to the puree. It brightens the flavor tremendously! And if you're a little more daring, a bit of chile powder or a dash of cayenne in the streusel for a complementary zing. I just wish I had the exact amounts for you!

i made this last year and really liked it but what nuts are everyone talking about?????

This is a perennial fave! Such a great mix of savory and sweet. I am constantly asked for the recipe. And as a bonus, it's super easy to make!

Two adults that won't eat sweet potatoes loved this. The only change I made was to add half a cup of chopped pecans to the potates in addition to the nuts in the strudel. This will be a tradition for Thanksgiving.

This has become a holiday staple at our house. My husband actually gets really disappointed if I make the sweet potatoes differently. They are very sweet though, and quite like dessert, so good for a family with a sweet tooth.

I served this side for Thanksgiving and my guests loved it. It is a great make ahead dish. My only change would be to cut the amounts next time. The servings for 8 are large.

Instead of making the potatoes pureed I sliced them and used the Streusel topping and covered with marshmallows! My family loved it! I will never make it another way! Yum!

Brilliant! And EASY!

For those who have made this before - do you bake (or reheat) this at 400? That seems high to me. I'm hosting Thanksgiving for the first time and trying to avoid major mishaps!

I agree it's a very safe recipe and it's nothing too gourmet. I have made it twice now. Streusel mixture can be reduced by almost half. The first time I made it I did the recipe as written and it was dessert sweet. Pretty yummy but just too much. It is a crowd pleaser and I love that it can be done a day ahead!

I used garnet yams, peeled and sliced instead of pureed them, omitted the butter and brown sugar and simply sprinkled the slices with cinnamon. I added a cup or so of chopped pecans to the topping mixture. They were delicious and plenty sweet and buttery enough.

These were a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I left out the nuts (one of my guests was allergic), but otherwise followed the recipe as written, and it was yummy. This will be on my holiday menu for years to come.

Guess I'm the only one who likes lotsa brown sugar in my sweet potatoes. I doubled the amount of sugar and used some half and half to make it a little creamier. Thought it turned out pretty well.

This dish was a hit with adults and ALL of the kids. Most kids were finicky initially, but once they tasted it all finished their portion and 7 of them wanted seconds of these sweet potatoes. I had to modify the recipe slightly as I was cooking for 30 people. I also opted out of marshmellows and added a cup of fresh pecans into the struesel topping. There was not a speck of this dish left after dinner while the other side dish leftovers languished in the fridge. I will make this again!

Great recipe but cut the sugar. I used Splenda brown and it worked out fine. It was a really bug hit.

Fabulous. Made it over and over again- rave reviews!

It was certainly easy. I made each component ahead, stored separately, put together the morning of and cooked for a dinner. Worked well. There were, however, mixed reviews and none were strongly in favor or against. An easy, safe recipe. Not something with which to wow people.

I made this for Christmas dinner following the suggestions to reduce the amount of butter and sugar added to the sweet potatoes. This worked well and the dish got rave reviews along with a request to make it again for New Year's Day dinner. My mistake was to use softened butter for the streusel topping. I would suggest for anyone who uses a food processor to leave the butter cold to achieve the crumbly texture for the topping. (My first attempt became the basis for a batch of cookies the next day so it wasn't a total waste!) This recipe is easy, delicious and will now be part of our family holiday tradition.

Very good and easy to make. I followed other reviewers and cut back on the butter in the puree and added a little milk. I think sweet potatoes are sweet enough without added sugar, so I left out the brown sugar in the puree. There was plenty of butter and brown sugar in the streusel to make the dish buttery and sweet. I agree with the last reviewer that a 1/2 recipe would be enough unless you have a really large crowd.

I made this twice this year. I made it for a potluck at work and everyone loved it and it was gone. I made it again for Thanksgiving dinner and even though everyone loved it there was just too much. I think next time I will make half the recipe instead of the whole thing.

Wow, this was a great sweet potato dish - I loved the topping! Easy dish to make - I made it 1 day ahead of time (stored the topping and potatoes separate). Will make again!

Classic recipe. Made it for this Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!. I made the streusel topping in a cuisinart and substituted oatmeal for half the flour and added cinnamon for some spice. Went over very well and the leftovers are even better today!

Oops...I meant 3/4 stick of butter.

The streusel topping is unbelievable. It seems vvery Gourmet magazine-ish, but is very easy! I probably used more than 5 lbs. of potatoes, and added 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1/4 cup light brown sugar to the potatoes. I like more texture, so I did not puree them. The streusel makes A LOT of topping, but it gets crispy and incredibly heavenly in the oven. Next time I make it I will probably use about 2/4 stick of butter.

So good, my husband who hates sweet potatoes couldn't get enough! It was esy to make, but the streusal could have been crunchier, but I don't know if that's something I did, or because of the recipe.

This was delicious and a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. The topping was pasty, not crumbly, but I was able to distribute it across the top. I added only a few T of brown sugar and 2 T of butter to my potatoes since they were already very sweet and delicious.

My family members really enjoyed it, but I didn't really care for it. I enjoy my sweet potatoes with citrus and spice rather than sweet toppings.

This is yummy. My husband absolutely loved it. As another cook said, the streusel was crunchy and stayed that way. I added a little bit of salt and pepper to taste and used a potato ricer for a wonderfully smooth testure. It's very rich--you only need a small serving.

My husband LOVED this dish! The sweet streusel topping came out crunchy and has stayed that way for leftovers. Thought the puree had too much butter, so I added another roasted sweet potato at the last minute to even it out. Next time I will only use 1/2 stick of butter in the puree.

Everyone loved this! Even 2 guests who said they usually don't like sweet potatoes, ate it up! I can't believe how yummy and easy to make they were. I will be making this every Thanksgiving!

The streusel recipe did NOT work for me. It was not crumbly and I had to keep adding flour to get it to the crumbly texture, then it was pasty tasting when cooked. I guess I should have added more sugar to make up for added flour? Will not make again.

It is true, this is a wonderful "desert" side dish. The crunchy streusel topping hints of carmel. I wonder if a tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate in the sweet potato puree and a teaspoon of tamarind puree in the streusel, would give it an Asian flare for a second choice flavor for all of us with sweet potatoes popping out of our gardens right now.
