I've made this for years now. Amazing. Restaurant quality. Hubby and I just went out for vietnamese and ordered a bahn mi. Hands down, this recipe wins. I cut back on the Chinese 5 spice and did not do the star anise. Otherwise followed recipe.

I have made this many times. Awesome every time! Few changes I make are to use thin sliced chicken breasts, pickled jalapenos and anise seed. Really good, really complex flavors!

Cut the bottom half of the bread thicker then the top so when it is hollowed out it holds all the ingredients. Grill the thighs without skin and slice as soon as cool enough to handle. Save the juices to pour over sandwich. Place the sandwich on a sheet of foil and wrap tightly to hold everything together. Basically this is street food so honor it in that fashion. Slice the peppers thinly and use sparingly if you are not seeding them. Ciao, Max Stanley, The Bistro of Burden.

This was wonderful and so easy. We just did it as chicken thighs, which took an extra 2-3 minutes in the broiler. I served it with a rice noodle salad. Making it again tonight!

I prepared this chicken last night to serve as an entree alongside a salad dressed with peanut lime vinaigrette and jasmine rice. Perhaps the conrastof flavors works better in the sandwich, but I found the marinade was much too salty. had my doubts when using light soy sauce + fish sauce + oyster suace that that would be the case, but the reviews did not mention saltiness so I put my faith in others who have tried this. I much prefer the Grilled Five Spice Chicken recipe by Mai Pham that's elsewhere here on the Epi site.

We loved this -- I marinated the chicken overnight and used red radishes, because I couldn't find daikon. Yummy!

I just tried this recipe last night and it turned out very good. I used chicken thighs with bone in, and removed the skin and marinaded for about 3 hours. The chicken came out very moist and flavorful. The Dikon and carrot marinaded for about 3 hours as well and was delicious. I used ciabetta bread, and lightly grilled. Next time I make this I am going to go for a softer bread though. I will definately make this again, it's a keeper!

Delicious, fresh, flavorful. I did NOT experience any smell issues with the daikon/carrot slaw... I made it 5 days ahead of time and stored it in the fridge, and there was no smell whatsoever. Sandwiches came together quickly and easily for serving. 1 shallot was plenty for the marinade. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

PU! Pickled the daikon/carrot mix, then placed it in tupperware, and placed in the fridge. An hour later, we were trying to figure out what died in our fridge! Wasn't expecting such an awful smell. Tasted fine, but for us, it wasn't delicious-enough to put up with the stank. Was a little embarrassing when the guests arrived - "no, I didn't toot...but that's your lunch you smell!" (The chicken was good)

This sandwich has it all-sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy combining for overall deliciousness! We made it exactly and I would not change anything. The marinated daikon and carrots are addictive. Awesome!

So yummy! I slice the chicken and use plenty of mayo and soy on the baguette. LOVE the crunchy daikon and carrot.

Holy cow! are these sandwiches great! what a blend of flavors. I too, used anise seed, as it's what i had on hand. I made these for the family, and the 5,7, and 9 year old asked/told me that i was making these again...soon! Wow! try this recipe!

I love this recipe. I have also made this same recipe with drained and pressed tofu instead of chicken. Also delicious.

Keeper! Omitted anise from marinade, and browned chicken in a skillet. Super easy and will definitely make again.

Excellent--I followed recipe very closely, and will definitely make again!

Have made these twice, each time to rave reviews. Only change I made was to skip the carrots the second time, and used ciabatta rolls instead of baguettes.

Delicious! I made this tonight for dinner. Very quick and easy to make. Both my husband and I loved this recipe.

Everyone loved this recipe in spite of not having 5-spice powder nor anise. It still came out great. I purchased fresh from the oven baguettes from Lee's Sandwiches (which is a Vietnamese fast food establishment). Definetely will make again

Perfect! Delicious! Changes that I made were: I sliced the chicken, used packaged pre-cut carrots, and regular cucumbers (seeded). A GREAT RECIPE!!!

Looking at the recipe again, I see I changed it more than I described earlier. I used anise seed instead of whole anise, skipped the cucmber and onion, and shredded the daikon and carrot instead of bothering to make matchsticks.

I've been looking for a recipe for banh mi, and this one is great! Used what I had on hand -- low-sodium soy sauce, rice vinegar instead of white, and pickled cherry jalepenos instead of fresh. I didn't have fish sauce, so skipped it. Skipped the mayo, too, and added a little worchestershire to the soy sauce you pour over the sandwich. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces and cooked them on the stove, then finished them under the broiler. The whole family loved them!

This is amazing. Seriously. The flavors are both simple (sweet, tart, savory) and really complex. It's a unique, absolutely delicious and easy recipe that is miles above your average grilled chicken sandwich. Guests raved and I was so glad that I'd doubled the recipe because leftovers were just as good for lunch the next day-- I can't believe I'm the first to rate it! My only suggestion, if you're inclined, would be to add a little heat to the marinade with a few sprinkles of cayenne. Either way, it's perfect; you really ought to give this one a try...
