Brought me back to my childhood when my Mom and Grandmother would make this cake. They would soak the raisins in the guiness for a couple of hours in advance - which I did - and I think it added to the most texture. I made it in a 9inch tin and it cooked way way faster - done in around an hour. I also upped hte spices a little added some extra ginger

Excellent addition to my St. Patty's Day Menu. I did make a wiskey butter sauce to put on it and instead of using pumpkin pie spices added my own pumpkin pie spice mixture.
