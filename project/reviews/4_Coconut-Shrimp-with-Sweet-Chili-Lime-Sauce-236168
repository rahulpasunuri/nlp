I'm only giving this recipe two stars because the breading/batter did not stick at all to the shrimp. Once in the oil all of the coconut sank to the bottom of the pan. It was as if we marinated the shrimp and boiled them in oil. We had to top the shrimp with the coconut after the fact and eat it with the sauce. Overall the flavors were nice but the dish was a bit messy because of the mishap. We will definitely use the sauce again as a substitute for regular cocktail sauce.

Crunchy, delicious and straight forward! I made this hours in advance for my bookclub gathering and re-heated in the oven just prior to serving. They reheated perfectly (crisped up) and I had guests requesting the recipe -even from individuals who do not like prawns! The sauce is a great accompaniment. I probably was able to coat over 30 large shrimp with batter remaining, so the recipe is generous. The tip of tapping the batter dipped shrimp alongside the inner bowl like a paintbrush is very handy. Removing the excess batter allows the shrimp flavour to come through after cooking and it allows the coconut to adhere to the shrimp better without it being a goopy mess. This is a keeper!

I use this recipe for parties I cater all the time. I love the curry in the batter... a nice subtle touch. When I make it for very large parties, I fry the shrimp a day in advance and then bake them to reheat in small batches for passed appetizers.

This makes a fabulous appetizer. We especially loved the dipping sauce. Note that the recipe make s a lot of extra sauce and batter, so get more shrimp or cut back on the amounts if that concerns you.

My rule is if I like it it gets 3 forks. If I really enjoy it and it's fairly easy to prepare, I give it 4. This is 4 forks all the way.

Great recipe. I made about two dozen shrimp with this and still had lots of batter and dipping sauce left over. Can't wait to make this for a party.

My family went nuts over this, they said it was better than anything they ever had in any restaurant. I, too, thought they were delicious.

Simple and quick but most important really good. Buy the unsweetened coconut the sweetened burns.

Excellent recipe. Used the sweet chile sauce and added some Meyer lemon juice and zest and cilantro. I just changed the order a little on the shrimp and left out the soda water. I rolled the shrimp in the flour/curry/salt/baking powder mixture, then rolled them in the beaten egg and then rolled them in the coconut. Nothing fell off and they fried up perfectly. Used Mexican Wild Caught Shrimp from Race Street Fish and Poultry in San Jose - these are the best shrimp!

Excellent. I didn't have a deep-fry set up so I pan fried them with a lot of oil. It was a hassle, but it worked; next time I will just try to deep fry. I made my own sweet chili sauce with thai chili paste, lime juice, rice vinegar, garlic, and honey and it was very good.

Absolutely scrumptious. The whole recipe is a breeze to make, and, as others said, the batter is sufficient for at least 25 shrimp. The best part is that I prpared and fried them completely about 5 hours in advance of serving, popped them in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes, and they came out crisped and perfect as if I'd just pulled them fresh from the oil. Great entertaining recipe.

Delicious, I made only the shrimp without the sauce and it was great. Easy recipe to follow.

this was great and easy! Plan to use a lot more than 16 shrimp because the recipe makes so much batter and dip

Another keeper. In response to the reviewer who said the coconut didn't stick, I found that the least amount of batter on the shrimp, the better the adhesion of the coconut. Simply pat the battered shrimp against the side of the batter bowl, (like you would a loaded paint brush), and flip-flop the shrimp into the coconut once.

The sauces makes this recipe. It's really easy and remarkable. Next time I'll use a finer shredded coconut and possibly sweetened. The flakes were too big to stick to the shrimp properly and it didn't have the sweetness I was hoping for.

I made these for a cocktail party for 60 and they were a big hit. I cooked the shrimp earlier in the day, put them on a baking sheet and refrigerated them. Just before the party I heated them in a 400 degree oven for 8 min. and they turned out just as crispy as when I first made them. The sauce was really popular too!

My family loved these, and the sauce was amazing. There is a lot more batter than the recipe needs, so plan to have a few extra shrimp to dip, or decrease amounts a bit. It felt like such a shame to dump the unused batter, since the dish is so tasty!

It was a HUGE hit at my app party.

This is absolutely fantastic! Super easy, little-to-no prep time, and even my roommate who doesn't like seafood ate more than his share of them. The sauce alone gets made often for stir-frying. This recipe was superb and I will make it again and again.

This was easy and wonderful. I thought I had soda water in the pantry, but it was tonic. I used that instead and it still worked out fine. I had no trouble with the coconut not sticking, though there was some left floating in the oil. If you freeze uncooked shrimp like I do, this is a quick last-minute meal as well as a great item to bring to a party.

I had already earmarked this recipe to make later when I attended a dinner party, and the hostess had made these shrimp. They were fantastic, there was a rush on the shrimp plate for the last one!

Made this for a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it. With the amount of batter, coconut and sauce for the given recipe, one can make many many more shirmp than the suggested 16. My only problem was that the coconut didn't stick well to the batter so many of my shrimp had bald spots.

This was definitely the star of the spread that I have offered at my football party. I wouldn't change a thing!

Have made this twice now and it is the hit of the party. The dipping sauce is an excellent compliment to the shrimp.
