I love earl gray and I adore honey. This recipe did not impress me.I doubled amount of earl grey, as suggested by the reviewers, but I think it only added some more bitter taste to it, like a tea that is too strong. The flavor of ear grey is practically undetectable. They are too also too heavy and dense, very bready. Not a dessert I will make again. I have made the Lemon recipe and that came out excellent. That recipie will make again. I also realized how important it is to chill the pan before baking. The Madeleines come out a lot prettier.

I made this & it was great! We even got in the spirit & tried it with a couple of different teas to see which one worked best -- our favorite was Cherry Tea! http://tinyurl.com/bez333

I absolutely agree with the cook from Chicago - these were a disappointment. The texture was too cake-like and, even though they smelled delicious while baking, there was no detectable Earl Grey taste in the cookies.

I just made this recipe from Dorie Greenspan's book. Unfortunately, the madeleines were a big disappointment. They turned out with no tea flavour and really heavy. I should have checked the reviews here first.

I thought these were nice. The honey was a fantastic addition. I used a spring flowers honey and that was the prominent flavor. I doubled the recipe and used 7 tea bags. I didn't really taste the tea. Next time I'll buy fresh loose leave tea. I'm hoping that will make a difference!

I have not made this recipe yet, but it sounds great. I wonder if it's necessary to go through the rigamarole of the cheesecloth ... For those who have made it -- could the tea be infused in teabags -- either store-bought or self-loaded? Also, is the honey absolutely necessary? Does it really add to the flavor balance?

These are the best Madeleine cookies I have ever tasted. They are moister than the true original French cookie. I wonder if the recipe will double easily. The batch went sooo fast.

Absolutley exquisite! These were by far the best madeleines I have ever made. I used four teabags instead of two, and there was defineltey a noticeable earl grey flavour. They were the perfect texture, light and airy on the inside with a bit of crisp on the outside! Delicious.

I made this using a mini-madeleine mold with Tazo's Awake tea and a leatherwood honey. They were delicious. I plan to make again for Thanksgiving. Raoul Tiger

A nice alternative to the traditional madeleines (I've always flavored mine with almond extract). Feel free to increase the amount of tea, since it isn't that strong in the finished cookie. Next time I make them, I'll probably brush the tops with honey -- they had all been devoured before I got to try it this time!

I love Madeleines and Earl Grey tea, but can't suggest this recipe. The texture was not right; much too fluffy and airy, and the Earl Grey flavor was almost undetectable. If I were to attempt this again, I'd try infusing the regular recipe for Madeleines on this site with tea. Overall, a disappointment.

These Madeleines Look Perfect! I'll try out the recipe later on today.
