Tastes mostly like canned tomatoes. I added 2 medium yellow onions, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This was a lovely recipe. It was so easy to make and flavorful. I did follow some of the suggestions of other reviewers. I added one onion chopped to the garlic mixture. I also add 1 tbsp tomato paste, for a bit more flavor. It could just have been the type of tomato I used, were not so flavorful. And lastly, I added small baby carrots at the end, allowed them to cook for 20minutes. It was a great dinner my family enjoyed, and I definitely will be making it again.

This was a fabulous dish, and very easy. I added two chopped yellow onions to the recipe. The broth was flavorful, the lamb was tender. It got raves from the male member of the household.

Very easy to prepare. I made this dish with a can of crushed tomatoes and served it over gnocchi (I got the idea from the May 2005 issue of Bon Appetit. Probably serves 4 people.

This was just wonderful. I had a small leg of lamb and cuded that meat and used fresh rosemery form my garden. I served the stew with couscous. I have already put another leg of lamb on my grocery list. This will definately be one of my favorite recipes.

Wow! Was I disappointed. As a lifelong lover of lamb and tomatoes and peas I thought this was going to be fabulous. Not. I followed the recipe exactly as written and did not even finish my portion. Threw it out in fact.

This was a great and very easy stew. For some reason, the crushed tomatoes I bought were not drainable, so I just put them in straight from the can. I needed to simmer for an extra 15 minutes or so. I served the stew over some mashed red potatoes with butter, 8 oz. ricotta cheese, and garlic, and served with a side salad. Heck, you only live once!

My second venture into cooking out of your recipes and my second resounding success following as per the recipe. Will definitely make again in the not so distant future and probably with variations as suggested by other reviewers

What a great tasting and so quick to prepare, easy dish! My partner who normally hates tinned tomatoes said this was the best tasting tomato-ey sauce I had ever made! Will definately make again.

If you like lamb this receipe is a must for your cockbook. The flavor is lively with a good blend of flavors. My husband (a real lamb man) couldn't stop raving over it. The kids liked the tasted enough to ask for seconds. Try this meal with homemade mashed potatoes.

Absolutely Fantastic! One of our favourites from the first time we made it. Fresh rosemary is much better to use than dried. If there are only two of you half only the meat - it tastes just as good!

this recipe is, also, good with fresh baby carrots added. I have been making this for years. it was an old favorite of my mothers.
