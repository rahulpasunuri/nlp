I've used this recipe many times and haven't had any problems with it. Love it! It's one of my all time favorites.

well, it tasted good, but: 1.i found the instructions confusing, 2. what is worse, the consytence of mixture was very liquid, even after 12 hours in refrigerator, and 2 in a freezer- once I put on a plate, it looked like melted ice cream. . my suggestion- look for something better. I will for sure.
