everyone in my family loved it. Not sure why it got such bad reviews.

I too was disappointed. The flavor was good; but the breadcrumb mixture did not adhere to the broccoli. Perhaps cutting the broccoli spears and florets in smaller pieces would have helped.

This was fantastic! Made it twice now for different people, and they loved it. Not sure why the other two reviews are so bad here, it pretty much does what it says on the tin; garlicky breadcrumb broccoli. I will say it is very much breadcrumbs caught in the broccoli, as opposed to broccoli coated with crumbs.

I had visions of crisp breadcrumbs napping the tender, garlicy broccoli; it was just GARLICKY and nasty.... Sorry....

I was disappointed with this recipe. It was rather bland and I ended up adding lemon juice. The flavors of garlic, lemon zest and mint were quickly absorbed and hidden in the fresh bread crumbs.
