I didn't rate this because I used whole Branzino (1/pp) and it is an entirely different fish, very thin and long. As for the recipe, make way too much aioli and next time I would add fewer eggs because the aioli was quite thick but did have great flavor. The garlic was very good. The fried artichokes with the aioli - exceptional. The tomatoes and fresh herbs I think are a waste. They are so overcooked by the time the fish is done it's impossible to serve them and the branzino takes less oven time. I also don't think the fresh herbs flavor came through on the fish. The aroma in the room before roasting was wonderful though. The seasoning mixture is a must and has great flavor. I would definitely make the artichokes again with the aioli but I'll find a different fish prep.

This recipe is a big winner! I used a Thai snapper in place of the red snapper purchased at Whole Foods. By the way they don't clean or scale the fish until you purchase it. Talk about fresh! This is my new favorite fish recipe. Extraordinarily easy and flavorful dish that had that WOW factor.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe, even my two young sons. It was a last minute dinner and did not take long despite the 3 stages. Did not have fresh artichokes so used canned and sauted in olive oil. Found Sumac for the Za'atar at Penzy's Spices. Couldn't afford Snapper so used Mako as recommended by the fishmonger.

Only thing i did different is the aïoli: 1 egg, 1 c. of olive oil (all at once), juice of 1/2 lemon, a bit of Dijon, salt, and about 4-5 roasted garlic cloves. Awesome recipe!

Fabulous recipe, and not that much trouble. Used an immersion blender for the aioli (Cuisinart model): 1 egg, 1 c. of olive oil (all at once), juice of 1/2 lemon, a bit of Dijon, salt, and about 4-5 roasted garlic cloves. Ready in 10 seconds without having to drip the oil in. Used redfish becaude that is more readily available in Louisiana. For the fish, I did a garlic confit for more flavor ("boiled" the garlic covered in olive oil at a very low temperature for about 1/2 hr). Last but not least I ran the fish under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end for a better appearance (my husband likes "browned" food!). The baby artichokes were fabulous and the entire combination was much much better than just about all my efforts at roasted fish. Oh, and I also served about 6-8 parboiled fingerling potatoes, since we always like a starch. Overall, this was better than most roasted fish I've had in restaurants.

FANTASTIC. Used redfish, since that's what's more available in Louisiana. USed an immersion blender for the aioli (1 edd, i c. oil, juice of half a lime, a tad of dijon, and roasted garlic. Perfect. For the fish, I cooked the gralic in olive oil very slowly to get more of a confit texture. After the fish was ready, I ran it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to get a better texture. Overall, one of the best roasted fish dishes I've ever made! And probably better than many of the ones I've had in restaurants.

We loved this recipe and have cooked it many times. The fish comes out so tender and the flavor of the za'atar is wonderful. I also love the artichokes!

Although due to missing ingredients, I have never followed the recipe exactly (using tilapia filets instead of snapper) and Herbes De Provence instead of the rosemary, etc. The dish lends inself well to substitutions, and serving with the fried artichokes is wonderful.
