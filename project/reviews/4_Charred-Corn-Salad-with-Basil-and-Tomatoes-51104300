Have made this twice, once on the grill and once in a grill pan. The grill is definitely better. Very popular. Loved it as written, but keep the tomatoes separate if you want the leftovers to last longer. We also made a Tex-Mex variation, subbing black beans, cilantro and jalapeno in for the basil and thyme.

I took some liberties with this recipe, so i didn't rate it 4 forks, although it turned out fabulously delicious and keeper for sure! I did my corn in the cast iron as suggested, and added a little cumin seed, red pepper flake, and dried thyme to the searing corn (look out for the popping corn, it makes a mess!) I could have dropped the thyme entirely. I used 3 ears of corn, about 5 medium tomatoes, and about a half cup of basil (a little purple thrown in for color). I did just a little lime, olive oil, salt and papper for dressing (juicy tomatoes made lots of yummy liquid). I put this over toasted garlic/red pepper toasts, similar to a bread salad, and topped with some avocado.I wondered if the cumin and basil would go oddly together, but not all - It made for great, light summer meal!

My husband LOVED this. I made it with 4 ears of corn and adjusted the ingredients acordingly. Great way to use pre-cooked corn.

Yummy! I halved the recipe and added about 2 tsp of honey to the oil and lime...whisked it with salt and pepper before putting anything else in. I used Vidalia instead of red onions, skipped the thyme and added some crumbled feta....turned out delicious! Def be making again!

This was amazing! Not only did it taste great, it was also visually appealing! Will definitely make this again!

This was a very tasty, simple recipe. The flavors were very satisfying and it's definitely worth making again. I did however, have a little trouble with grilling the corn properly. We have a Weber gas grill and I let it heat up to 600F before putting the corn on. It left me with either perfectly cooked but not charred at all. I left some on the grill and those ended up overcooked (you know when the kernel casings stick to your teeth. Yuck.). Next time I'll leave the grilling to my husband. I hate to admit it, for so many reasons, but he is better at it.

Used fresh corn but boiled did not grill it was delicious...Had it for a girls night dinner and everyone enjoyed. Will try again when I can grill flavor will be even better.

Yum! Yum! Easy to prepare, a visual feast and so delicious!! I'm going to get a lot of mileage out of this recipe.

Excellent! Rinsing the red onions really did help mellow the flavor. I wouldn't recommend making this too far in advance though. I tried the leftovers the next day; it was a bit mushy and the lime flavor was VERY strong.

Delicious combination of flavors and so colorful! Served it as a side with grilled pork tenderloin. Made a perfect simple dinner. Will definitely make it again.

My partner loved this. The basil adds a lot. Great summertime side dish. I'll make it again.

This recipe was exceptionally good, but using fresh ingredients from the farmer's market was probably key. I am not sure if it would taste the same with out-of-season supermarket products - not saying it wouldn't still be good, but we may have been ruined for that preparation having tasted the in-season way. Ten-month old daughter LOVED it. Used the equivalent of probably four tomatoes in the form of cherry tomatoes, sliced.

I made this salad a couple of weeks ago with the first corn of the season from Upstate, New York. It was beyond fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly and I must say that the fresh Thyme was delicious. I will definitely make this again and again.

Is it possible to make this the night before and then take it out one hour before company comes?

Tremendous! Made as written. Loved the appearance of the red onions married with the corn, tomatoes and basil, so would not substitute scallions. The blending of flavors pops! This was a great accompaniment to the Best Ever Ribs in the same issue.

My guests seemed to like it, but I thought it could have used something more. I will add feta next time as suggested by others. Be careful when you grill the corn- it burns easily.

Fantastic! I prepped everything the night before (roasted the corn, cut the tomatoes, etc.), stored them separately, and then combined it all at the last minute. It held up really well and got great reviews. If you are looking for one of several picnic side dishes, this is great. I had 12 people over and still had leftovers.

Outstanding, it sounds so simple but what a hit! I had served this with the turkey burgers from the same issue along with dill aioli.

Made this for my wine club last night according to the recipe but added about 1/2 cup feta cheese. It still needs a bit of additional salt but was well-received at the party and leftovers were great for lunch today! I think the green-onion idea is a good one . . .

This salad is a taste of summer and especially with our Jersey corn and tomatoes. I will make this again and again as it is so easy and refreshing. I made it as stated but I agree some feta or similar cheese would be a plus. Will try that next time.

Fresh and summery with a smokey char flavor from the grill. Lovely! Followed the recipe and it was a big hit at dinner. Served it with chicken tacos ( recipe here on Epicurious, Cumin and Ancho Chicken) -- yum!

Yep, this recipe is spot on. It's not a show stopper per say, but it's got the right mix of, well, everything. I actually used canned tomatoes that I squeezed the juice and seeds out of since Chicago tomatoes can be sad, and I didn't feel like going to the store. I did a small version of this with just 2 ears of corn, scaling everything down and it was so perfect.

I've made this twice and everyone has loved it, even the leftovers. The only changes I made were to use green onions instead of red and I added Feta cheese crumbles for a little more oomph. I'm making it again this weekend and I know it'll be a hit with them too.

Perfect summer salad. I charred the corn in a cast iron skillet (in batches), and it turned out very nicely. Omitted the onions for my boyfriend, but I didn't really miss them in this salad. Made this to go with grilled chicken and zukes, and will definitely make again. Easy recipe to halve.

Incredibly fresh and delicious - charred the corn on All Clad stovetop grill, otherwise made as written. Just as tasty second day. Lime and fresh basil, heirloom cherry tomatoes - we'll make this all summer!

Wow, this was excellent. We have NJ corn just coming into season along with fresh basil and thyme from the herb garden. I also used some local fresh cherry tomatoes and it was just delicious. My husband loved it too. This is definitely a keeper. I am excited for the leftovers.

Except for the headache of shucking all that corn, this recipe was easy and really good. The kids loved it (always a big test) and the leftovers taste great too. I served it with grilled sirloin steaks and a butter lettuce salad. However, I would like to experiment a bit with this one to add some oomph.

We LOVED this salad. I grilled the onion while the corn was grilling; we like the mellow taste of grilled red onion. Did everything else pretty much as described.It's delicious and kept for several days in the refrigerator.

I brushed the corn with garlic flavored olive oil before grilling and this salad was amazing! It is even better the next day. The lime and olive oil dressing and the basil cannot be beat for flavor with the charred corn..a new family summer favorite.

This was a huge hit at a 4th bbq. I added a few fresh fava beans and topped with a few bacon bits and shaved parmesan. Delicious!

This dish has rapidly become a summer staple. To keep cool in DC's brutal heat, I use the stove top method for charring the corn as suggested in the head note. I also use MUCH less oil. Otherwise, it is a perfect summer side.
