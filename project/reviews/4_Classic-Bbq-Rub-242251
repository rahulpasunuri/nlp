Mixed this up last night and ground it all up in our coffee grinder before applying to boneless/skinless chicken breasts. Turned out really really nice. Just enough of a kick without being "spicy."

Just finished dinner ... a five star summer feast! Used this rub on boneless pork ribs ... superb!!!! Only change was dialing down the cayenne a little. Served with "Corn on the Cob with Mint- Feta Butter" ... look it up ... a perfect summer pairing. And ... a cold beer ... :-)
