I made this for a potluck and people liked it A few people raved about it.Honestly It wasn't worth the work.It tasted OK.My husband and I decided that the others liked it because they don't cook. I will not be making it again.

I made it and winged what I had to do with the blackberry preserves. If I did it again I would exclude the sugar in the egg whites-the cake ends up being much too sweet with the curd and preserves.

what do you do with the blackberry preserves? Did I miss something?

Made only the mousse for another cake today and it DID NOT squish out. It was great. I used another recipe for lemon mousse for my daughter's birthday cake about a month ago and it was a disaster of squishy, slipperiness. I will try this with the entire recipe next. Very, very pleased.

This cake is pretty good. But for the amount of time I had to devote (and yes I've made my own lemon curd many times before) it was not exceptional. So I am enjoying eating it right now, but will not make it again. Oh, and the ginger flavor was entirely cancelled out.

This cake is very good, and i cannot imagine doing it all in one day, it would be a disaster unless you are a serious pro. making the the cake the day before let's the flavor settle in before you start to stack it. It looks impressive too.. and on a last note, someone said to not spread the filling to the sides.. they must have not been chilling it long enough. I did not spread it out, and chilled it for the right amount of time and it just ended up breaking the cake because the filling was not even. SO .. spread evenly to the sides, then chill! Also- don't skip the preserve, it adds great flavor and nice color.

This cake is a lot of work so it should be prepared on a afternoon devoted to cooking and at least the night before serving. I made this on a Saturday for dinner guests that evening & it was terrible. My husband wanted to throw it out. I couldn't bring myself to do that because of the $ spent on all the ingredients not to mention the time spent preparing. So I took it to work on Monday and to my surprise it was delicious. It was a big hit. I could not find blackberry preserves so I used blackberry jam but I think it would be better with preserves if you can find them.

Okay. The cake is dense like a pounds cake and totally gets lost once all the filling gets added in. I really liked the lemon mouse - its a decadent way to dress up the cake. Overall the parts are better, I would say your time and ingredients are better spent on a different dessert. As a side note, the cake is very tall and unstable.

ho hum!! It was way more work than worth it. It was expensive too. I HAD to make it for my gourmet club, everyone liked it, at le4ast they said they did. It was a mess to cut and was just not worth the work!

The concept of the cake is wonderful and the fillings are delicious, but it just isn't amazing. I think the problem is the cake itself. Its ok, but not great. I will certainly change the cake batter next time to something fluffier. I used raspberry because I didn't have good store-bought blackberry preserves. I also added a thin layer of dark chocolate with lemon zest ganache right on top of the raspberry, yum. The lemon curd was very nice (there are better recipes out there) and the mousse was lovely, but I was glad I added that hint of chocolate richness, especially because it was a special occasion. Presentation is really beautiful but the cake layers looked a little bit rough-edged to me compared to the picture. So I stopped making white chocolate curls and I made a whipped white chocolate and cointreau ganache and lightly iced the outside. The whipped ganache was heaven and it took just minutes to do. So then I got to thinking that a cake this time consuming should be exceptional. This just wasn't. If I make it again I will play around some more with a few of the changes I have already mentioned. One of my guests suggested replacing the middle layer of cake with white chocolate ganache. I think there are probably a lot of good ways to get creative with the components here. One more note: I didn't have any trouble with the filling squishing out but I chilled the layers for a good 30min. Its also easy to assemble, but I recommend breaking up the steps over a couple of days.

I made the cake, used storebought curd, and made a cream cheese frosting, instead. Excellent. The cake is wonderfully moist while still being light and airy, and the mixture of curd and blackberry filling is also nice and light. I simply mixed the curd and blackberry jam together and used that as a filling. I can't comment on the mousse frosting but a simple cream cheese frosting on the top and the outside lent a nice creaminess, and I didn't have to worry about the contents smooshing out. I was told I can make this cake and bring it over any time, so it certainly went over well.

Delicious - don't be intimidated by the number of steps. It can be broken down and made the day before your party. I did not use the blackberry preserves, and didn't miss them. I also didn't have 2 9" cake pans, so used 3 8" cake pans instead, and levelled the tops off of two of the layers to form a three layer cake. Cooking time in my oven remained around 45 minutes. This cake drew raves at my birthday party. Perhaps the only change I might make next time is to use a cake flour, rather than an all-purpose flour, just to see if I can get a bit lighter texture. However, it was moist, lemony and not too sweet. Exactly what I wanted.

This cake is delicious and although it is multi step - I have made it several times and it comes out perfectly every time!! Well worth the extra effort!

This is definitely one of the best cakes I've had, and that's in spite of my rushing through it and not doing the best job on assembling it! I used limes instead of lemons and homemade raspberry jam (with seeds) because that's what I had on hand, and it was incredibly delicious. It's a lot of work, and I'm glad I had a KitchenAid (I wouldn't want to do this with a small, wimpy mixer!), but it is worth every ounce of effort. Plus, I'll probably be using the curd recipe for scones, it was far better than any purchased curd I've ever had.

AMAZING! Really, fantastic. If you want to impress someone, this is your recipe. It's as beautiful on the eyes as it is to the palette. Do take at least 2 days to make it - the first for the lemon curd and cake, the second for the mousse and assembling. It is a bit labor intensive, but WELL worth it. One tip is to use bendable cutting boards for each layer. They spin well when frosting and are easy to stick in the refridgerator. I liked this recipe so well, I bought Mary Cech's entire cookbook.

I made this cake over a 3 day period (one day curd, one day cakes, next day assemble and serve). It was a challenge, but EXTREMELY worth it. It was one of the best cakes I have every had. And my guests could not stop talking about it. If you plan, this isn't that hard to make, just kind of time intensive. I didn't have any trouble with anything running off the sides, but I think I put a thinner layer of curd and preserves than what was recommended. The sweet, tart, and ginger flavors combine to perfection (and I'm not even a big fan of ginger). Will make again!!

I'd like to give this cake 1 fork, but my guests liked it enough to give it 3. So I guess 2 is sufficient. Um.....I think there are much better lemon cakes out there. This one was so much work. I found it to be more tart than sweet. I didn't like the blackberry preserves on this cake at all. Homemade preserves would have been much better. If I accidently make this cake again, I'll leave the preserves off. I agree with another member... don't spread the "goop" to the edge. It does squirt out when you build it. I will grant that this cake was very pretty. Both whole and sliced. This just wasn't for me.

OH MY GOD!!! my daughter in law made this cake for Easter and it's by far the best cake I've ever eaten...fabulous flavors,wonderful texture and every bite begging for more. Defintely a keeper.

A time intensive cake, but definitely worth it!!! The kicker would be to make your own blackberry preserves. The only caution I have is to be careful when you spread the layers (i.e preserves, curd, mousse) to spread no further than 1 inch from edge of cake layers; it spreads in fridge and then spreads more once you stack the layers... you'll get a mess running over the edges of the cake if you don't. Can't wait to make it again. Next time I'll be making more of the curd just for eating with my scones.
