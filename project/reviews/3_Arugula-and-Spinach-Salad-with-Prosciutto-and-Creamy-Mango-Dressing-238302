The dressing was delicious. I used red leaf lettuce and spinach. Grilled the asparagus and added some crumbled goat cheese.

Tasty. I made this with the Coriander Crusted Scallops, the other recipe included in this menu. The two were both light and perfect for a sunny spring meal. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, it turned out great!
