Delicious and relatively healthy. You can fill the apples with pretty much any fruit you like... I used fresh blueberries and gold raisins. Also subbed honey with light agave. The first time, I baked the apples too long and they kind of "wilted" so I made sure to keep an eye on them the 2nd time around.

Yum! I made modifications per our tastes and the comments here - chopped pecans instead of dried fruit, added a sprinkle of cinnamon, and water instead of juice. They were still very rich and sweet - love it!

Couldn't have been easier -- nice, light dessert. Next time, I will add lemon or orange zest, as the sweetness needed a little tange. I added dried cranberries and dried cherries to the chopped dried friuts. I might conisder chopped pecans next time as well.

Good, but a little too tart for my tastes.
