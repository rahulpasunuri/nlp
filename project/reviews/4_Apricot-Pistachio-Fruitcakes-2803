This is an amazing fruitcake recipe. I have been making this for years. I call it holiday cake for those (including my husband) who cringe at the word, "fruitcake." Even my husband will sneak a bite of this cake. Sometimes I use a amaretto/bourbon combination instead of a full cup of bourbon.

It's okay, nothing special. I think there are too many items in it. If I ever do make this again (but don't think I will) I'd lose the coconut and the almonds. It just didn't have that much flavor. I think I'll stick to traditional style fruitcake and use dried fruit instead of candied fruit. This just wasn't that good. I did try it 3 ways - one rum, one peach brandy, and one with the bourbon called for in the recipe. The winner is the rum. And, you do have let it sit for several days, if not a couple weeks, wrapped in cheesecloth dipped in the aforementioned alcohol to get any real flavor. That is what is traditionally done with fruitcake, and boy did this one need it, too.

For anyone who is interested, for 1/18 (a 1 inch slice) of this fruitcake it is about 530 calories. I'm saving mine for christmas and hope it is worth it!

I made this cake today (november 21) will it still be good on christmas. Also is it okay to use jam in place of preserves. And can it be wrapped in saran wrap, and at room temperature for the duration of the month

Excellent. I excluded coconut, used dried apricots instead of peaches, rum instead of bourbon. Also found I didn't need to bother with the parchment in the loaf pans. Just buttered pan and cake came out with no problem. Great cake!

I plan to make this with apicot or peach vodka (whatever I have on hand) instead of bourbon. In the pastI have found this to realy enhance an orange stone fruit flavor. I am sharing my revision now rather than after because I will probably forget after. Also will use apicots rather than peaches and pears. Macademia nus would probably be as good as pistachios.

This was excellent. I omitted the coconut, (my husband doesn't like it) substituted apricots for the peaches and used white peaches instead of pears. I followed the technique exactly. Yuummm!!

I made a tropical version of this cake, substituting chopped dried mango for the peaches, chopped macadamias for the pistachios and Myers dark rum for the whisky...fabulous!

CORRECTION: I bought and included the mysterious missing apricots instead of the full cup of dried peaches. Two other people picked up the misnomer; still someone needs to change the name, RIGHT?

As the cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz once said, "who put the Ape in Apricot?" ...Courage. Taste great, but what's up with the name of this dish?

This is a fabulous recipe. Even people who hate fruitcake love it! Made several to give as gifts last year and everyone raved. Will definitely make again this year!

I told everyone this was "whisky and butter cake" (because that's what it tastes like) and avoided the whole "fruitcake" stigma. It is soo delicious, I found myself craving it instead of the nanaimo bars, brownies, shortbread and other Christmas treats. I used mini-cake trays and gave some away. All recipients thought it was delicious. I will definately make this an annual favourite. (I used dried apricots instead of peaches.)

I made this recipe and used glazed apricots and apricot preserves. The cakes were delicious, and I will make this recipe again. People who do not like regular fruitcake really liked this.

Excellent! I used small bundt pans(to be given as gifts)and the recipe worked perfectly. Be sure to butter & flour the pans and I baked them for 30 minutes at 300F. I also used regular milk and dried apples(I couldn't find pears). I also used macadamia nuts instead of pistachios. Perfect for gifts!!

My fruitcake is delicious, but I have an extraneous bag of apricots, since I thought I'd missed an ingredient when I made the grocery list and bought them anyways. The title really needs to be changed.

I've been making this almost every year to give in gift baskets along with other home-made goodies, and I've wondered about the apricot discrepancy between title and ingredient list. I was delighted to see it appear here, hoping to find out the secret behind this - or at least to see a corrected recipe! I've been making it without the apricots and just renamed it: Pistachio Bourbon Cake. It's delicious!

I haven't made this yet, but will for gift-giving. However, I am wondering about the name of the recipe as compared to the ingredients. I don't see that there are any apricots used. Why not just call it peach/pistachio instead? The name given in misleading. I will use apricots.
