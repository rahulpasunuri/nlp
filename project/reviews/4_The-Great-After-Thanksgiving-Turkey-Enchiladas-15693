Big hit. : )

Fantastic dinner for leftover turkey (or chicken as well) - it was a huge hit at our table of four adults. I used green enchilada sauce as that's my preference, and cherry tomatoes as that was what was leftover from the feast day. I didn't prep the tortillas in the oil, but dipped them into the warm sauce - by leaving them in it for a minute or so they soften up very nicely. And if they break, well, pouring the sauce over the top and then some shredded cheese will cover it up and nobody notices! I'll make it again before next Thanksgiving, for sure.

Very good, easy, excellent use of leftover Thanksgiving turkey (or any other poultry, I would imagine). Next time I will use a canned enchilada sauce that is NOT green (with the tomatoes the finished product was on the gray side), and canned diced tomatoes (1-14.5oz can) instead of fresh at this time of year. I'm not sure why you would skip the step of cooking the tortillas in oil; it softens them up nicely (I do this with huevos rancheros too): use 1 tble of oil for two tortillas, stacking them on each other and then flipping and turning so that each tortilla side is cooked 20-30 seconds total.

Hi!! Happy Thanksgiving.Thanks for sharing this thanksgiving recipe. I will try thanksgiving Turkey Enchiladas in this thanksgiving celebration for my family and friends. Thanksgiving recipes include a vast menu comprising of turkey, various kinds of desserts, corn preparations, smashed sweet potatoes, bread, cranberry sauce and other dishes.

I have found this a fantastic recipe to use up both pheasant and wild turkey thigh/leg meat that many people don't even save. Simmer meat with some poultry spice until bones & tendons pull easily and you are set to go. Fabulous results!

This recipe is exceptional if made exactly according to the recipe, but also is very versatile and can be changed up depending on what you have on hand. I've made it a number of times, both per the recipe and with variations. I made it for my extraordinarily picky siblings tonight and they loved it. Win!

I've tried different enchilad recipes over the years, and found these to be a great one! But a few notes for future users of this recipe, however. For one thing, I found it made way too much sauce - I had TONS left over! I would suggest cutting the sauce portions in half. Also, in order to give the sauce a little body, I gave it a few quick whirs w/an imersion blender - not a total puree, but a partially so that the sauce still has some texture. The recipe makes plenty, and all my guests really loved the enchilads. Easy and good - my favorite recipe combo!

Made this with my leftover turkey and we really enjoyed! I mixed red and green enchilada sauce, added a bit a cumin to the turkey mixture and served it with a black bean, tomato and corn salad made with fresh lime juice. Hubby said definitely make this again!

This is an exceptional dish. On the east coast the Mexican restaurants never seem to complete with the west coast. This is one dish that exceeds expectations and is better than any restaurant. Cannot wait to make it again. Oh and I used light sour cream. Just as good.

Just made this with leftover turkey and I have to say it was exceptional (did everything but the tortilla step, which I didn't really get the point of). The grocery store I stopped at did not happen to have canned enchilada sauce so I bought tomato paste and made an easy recipe myself. Ate with guacamole and a spinach salad. Highly recommended!

Two guests and my partner said these were the most delicious enchiladas they've ever eaten. I'd have to agree. Now, the modifications I made: Green Enchilada sauce 5 heirloom tomatoes from my garden 2 tsp chipotle paste (nothing fresh at my store) 2 cups of cilantro (used some for garnish) Purchased handmade tortilla's (herb and chipotle) After cooking the sauce according to the recipe for 15 minutes I added the chopped turkey for the remaining 5 minutes then drained the turkey out and put it in the corn tortilla's with some cheese and cilantro, rolled up, placed in baking dish and poured remaining sauce on top. Sprinkled with extra cheese and baked. Delicious!

A great way to use those Thanksgiving turkey leftovers. I used 21 oz. of salsa verde instead of enchilada sauce, leftover creme fraiche instead of sour cream, and skipped the tortilla step. Turned out well, and husband loved them!

I've tried this recipe two ways. Tonight, made it with green chile enchilada sauce and replaced the chipoltes with minced jalapenos. Also sub'd greek yogurt for the sour cream and added chipoltes to the turkey mixture. It's a winner.

I come back to this recipe again and again. I have modified it at various times due to guest tastes (omitted cilantro, added or decreased spice, used different cheeses, etc.) and have never been disappointed. I prefer it with chicken rather than turkey, but both taste great. The sauteed onions give it a little sweetness, while the chiles (which I always find packed in adobo sauce) lend a unique flavor with a bit of a kick. A great, no-fail base recipe that can be modified to suit any taste.

This was excellent! I'm so glad I lost my enchilada recipe :) I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted the turkey for rotisserie chicken. It takes about 2 hours start to dinner table. Refrigerates and freezes well.

Really Excellent dish! Everyone Loves it wherever I take these or whoever comes to eat at our house... I put the chipotles in the blender or chopper and freeze the rest, break off a bit to toss in chili or any other dish that wants a little kick. I don't use as much sauce and if I don't have the fresh tomatoes I use a can of rotel with green chilies, it's all good.

Rating: 4
I made the following amendments based on what was in my cupboard: green chili enchilada sauce instead of red, 1 Serrano chili chopped and sautéed with the onions instead of chipotle, chopped portobella mushrooms and just one tomato for five plum tomatoes, chopped parsley for chopped cilantro. All else the same. It was yummy!

Rating: 4
Great sauce - so much more flavorful than straight out of the can, and the filling was yummy. Here is how I modified it (based on what I had on hand): 1 can chopped tomatoes in place of fresh, a generous sprinkling of dried cilantro leaves in place of fresh, and chicken in place of turkey. For the chipotles, I keep a supply of frozen, pureed chipotle in adobe sauce in my freezer (I never use enough from one can); shaved off about a tablespoon and added it (frozen, it melts quickly) and simmered as instructed -nice and spicy! Once the sauce had simmered, I used the hand blender to puree the tomatoes - not too fine, just enough to get the big lumps out. My family loved these enchiladas. The filling was more than enough for 12 enchiladas - I made 16, and could have stretched it a bit more if I needed to. Served with quinoa cooked with salsa, cumin, and garlic for an excellent side dish.

I followed the recipe pretty closely but used chicken instead. This was sooo good, the best I've ever had or made. Would definitely recommend it. It is very good with homemade salsa too. The chipotle is a must to use.

I have made this several times with chicken. EXCELLENT! Boyfriend and son love it.

These were solid (no major complaints among diners) but not amazing. I must admit I made a few changes based on available ingredients. For the sauce I had one 10oz can of hot enchilada sauce, which I augmented with diced canned tomatoes and the called for fresh tomatoes and chipotle peppers. The sauce was OK, but not stellar (although certainly spicy enough for our tastes). I used roasted chicken instead of turkey and upped the amount of cheese. Like several others, I microwaved the tortillas (yellow corn) rather than frying them individually - no problem there. I added a bit of the sauce to the chicken mixture as well as a small can of summer crisp corn, which I would do again. I'm going to be on the search for alternate enchilada sauce recipes and will give this another try in future.

I don't have a lot of experience making Mexican or Tex-Mex food, but this was fairly easy for a beginner to put together. I microwaved the tortillas instead of frying them and used light sour cream. The dish tasted rich enough for me. Delicious! I think it would be even better with chicken. One note: The amount of sauce was enough for me to make 18 enchiladas, and I fed 9 people with it.

Rating: 0
I thought the sauce was great (used 1 can mild, 3/4 can hot ench sauce + 1/2 c chicken stock to thin it out), and loved the recipe overall. used 1/2 grated cheddar + 1/2 queso fresco in filling. was able to fill 13 tortillas.

I only gave this a 2 because I found the sauce to be completely nasty. The filling was really good though. I may make it again but serve it with plain salsa or taco sauce. Then it would probably be pretty good.

I used chicken instead of turkey, 1 can of mild and 1 can of medium enchilada sauce and 2 chipotle chiles with the seeds. 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 chipotle cheese and garnished with black olives. This recipe is a keeper! Everyone who attended the dinner asked for it.

Made this with 2 different fillings. Filling #1: veggie chickn strips from Trader Joe's; Filling #2: a mirepoix of sauteed summer squash, onion, fresh corn kernels, and green onion. Both were fantastic topped with a bit of extra sour cream & ripe avocado. Doubled the chipotle chiles (de-seeded) and added a couple of teaspoons of the adobo sauce for extra kick. Stuffed ourselves silly. Meant to top with some queso fresco too, but ended up forgetting about it.

This is the best enchilada recipe I have ever made. I am SO glad I lost my old recipe, otherwise I would not have had the opportunity to try this one. Great flavor, not too hot. Couldn't find the chipotle peppers, so used mild diced green peppers. It made 16 enchiladas for me. Yummy!

I thought this was really delicious. Very clever idea to liven up canned enchilada sauce with chipotles. Neither my husband nor I really like turkey but we love this dish. I've used this easy sauce to make vegetarian enchiladas as well.

This is a great, versatile recipe. I made it as written after Thanksgiving with turkey and then again tonight with leftover pork loin roast and chipotle cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack. The smokiness of the cheese really complimented the pork--my husband loved it! I'll use this one often with different leftover meats and experiment with different cheeses.

really good! i sed the cream cheese too and also added some canned corn and some rinsed black beans. also to make it easier on me i used canned diced tomatoes. so easy and hubby had thought it took a lot of trouble by the way it looked on the plate:-). oh and i also used a mix of white cheddar (cabot) and pepper jack. and i still had a good kick in there. thanks for ALL the tips everyone, it really helps!!

Following other comments, I used cream cheese instead of sour cream and added a half bag of frozen corn and a can of black beans, rinsed. Also used what had in the cabinet - 10 oz can of enchilada sauce and 14.5 oz diced tomatoes. Very good - next time I would add more chipotle or use a spicer cheese.

Really really good. Better than I expected. Used all the sauce on top rather than passing on the side.

What a great way to finish up Turkey-Day leftovers once the thought of another sandwich is repulsive. I used spicy enchilada sauce and it added a nice kick. Also, I did not have any sour cream so I used plain yogurt instead and it was delicious. Was relatively easy to make and so yummy. My husband LOVED it!

Very good! Once a put the shredded turkey in the tortillas I added about 3 tablespoons of sauce and a small amount of cheese. I felt the turkey may be too dry. Anyway, I would do that again. It was very good!

I have been making this recipe for years. Funny, but I got the recipe from a local cooking class I took. This is a favorite. I often make it with just cheese and onion or replace the turkey with chicken. Anyway, the sauce is yummy!

This was a great, simple post-thanksgiving recipe! Just the right amount of kick for us. Notable modifications: we used our leftover turducken meat instead of just turkey, and dumped all the sauce on before baking. So, I guess we could call our dish turduckenchiladas.

This is my 20 year old son's favorite dish. He insists that I make it several times a year in addition to after Thanksgiving. I find that yellow corn tortillas work better than white corn; and used a Mexican blend grated cheese for a bit more flavor. I also substituted pico de gallo in place of plain chopped onions to the filling. Delish!

Rating: 3
We enjoyed these very much. The turkey stuffing tasted more like a turkey salad to me than an enchilada stuffing (it would make a great sandwich!) but it wasn't a problem in the end result. I agree that the sauce is so-so. I used La Fiesta hot enchilada sauce but found the sauce too thin so I added some additional chopped tomatoes and let it cook down, but in the future I think I'll look for another sauce. I can't believe a Texas cook would drop the chipotles! Really good. We had a lot of leftover turkey so we had these twice!

The basics of the recipe are great. I have modified one thing, instead of using the enchilada sauce above I substitute it with a mole. This can be either store bought or hommade but it is really great with turkey!!

This is fantastic dish. We wanted a change to the "standard" leftover turkey recipes, and this is it. We're saving this one. This makes WAY too much sauce, though (and it's not great sauce, either), so I'll probably use another recipe for the sauce part. Otherwise, this one's a winner.

Great for leftover turkey or even roasted chicken. Very easy to make, tasty and keeps well for leftovers. I used the Las Palmas canned enchilada sauce with no extra peppers and it worked out. Would definitely make again!

I thought this was o.k. but the others at my table really liked it. I substituted fatfree plain yogurt for the sour cream and softened the tortillas in the microwave as opposed to frying in oil. I also used jalapeno jack which really moved up the heat. I loved the filling but wasn't wild about the enchilada sauce. I think I'll leave out the chipotle peppers next time.

Delicious. The last time I made this I decided to try the enchilada sauce by Anna Marie on allrecipes.com (thanks jvartanian from Chicago!), and we were very pleased with the results. I sometimes substitute ancho powder and/or smoked paprika when chipotles aren't available. My family loves this dish.

Rating: 4
i thought this was a SUPER use of leftover turkey. I had the whole breast and wings leftover from thanksgiving (prefer dark meat), so i used that in this recipe. Did not give it a "gamey" or strong flavor AT ALL! I added more cheese than what the recipe called for; otherwise I followed the instructions. I have never made enchiladas before, and I thought these were just fabulous. Even though you are using store-bought sauce, i still turned out great. Just a little prep work and you have a satisfying meal. I will definitely make these again....and who said anything about waiting until Thanksgiving.

The 98% "would make again rating says it all." I've been making this for several years - we actually buy a large T'day turkey to make sure there's enough!!! Two simple mods that work well.... Microwave about 14 corn tortillas for a few minutes in a stack - they will be quick & easy to use, taste great, and lower fat. Also, I keep dried chipotles on hand and reconstitute w/ boiling water in a small bowl for 20 mintues or so. WHATEVER YOU DO - MAKE THIS DISH!!!

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe except I ommitted the chipolte chillis thinking my kids may eat it (they didn't) and it was fantastic. Really easy - it will become part of our repitriore, great for company as it tastes even better the next day! try it, you will not be sorry!

Delicious and attractive. Definitely more cheese for the top. I made it with chicken. The meat mixture needs salt, I didn't add much and it was a little bland, but overall great recipe.

I found turkey drumsticks on sale at the grocery store, and roasted those to use in this. I think next time I'd just use either chicken or ground turkey, as the turkey gave this kind of a gamey flavor. Still and all, delicious. I don't think you need quit as much sauce as they've written this - we didn't feel it need any extra at the table. I also added more cheese on top - maybe another 1/2 cup.

It's worth roasting a turkey just to have leftovers for this recipe. It's that good. I used diced canned plum tomatoes in the sauce, because fresh ones are awful this time of year, and nuked the tortillas. Otherwise followed the recipe as is. It's great and filling; serves more than 6 if you're serving other courses.

Absolutely divine! I doubled the chilies (I tend to like things spicier than most) and let them stew for the 20min, then discarded some since it was way too spicy. What was left was great tasting sauce. We liked it so much we were trying to determine if you could get three cups of meat off a chicken to make these at other times of the year without having to cook up a turkey.

Made these last nite to disguise the turkey from the fowl hating husband. They were great! You could use any leftover meat and they'd be good. I cut down the ingredients for 2 and used half enchilada sauce and half tomato sauce. Also used flour tortillas cause I like them better when baking.

This was soooo yummy. I've been looking for a great enchilada recipe for a while now, and I think I've found it. We used ground turkey and whole wheat flour tortillas instead and it was very good. I'd be interested in trying it again with actual shredded breast meat and corn tortillas. The sauce was a little tomatoey, but perhaps the tomatoes I used were large. All in all, this was a great dinner. A definite keeper!

A big hit with my husband. I liked it well enough to make again. Our local grocery store had only one brand of enchilada sauce--not one I would buy if I had another choice--and I found it a bit acidic. We will have the opportuntity next week to shop in a Mexican grocery and I will buy some better sauce and try this again, but with chicken or pork since the Christmas turkey is now finished. My guess is that it will become a 4 star recipe then.

I had trouble finding the chipotle chilies, so I substituted diced green chilies and a small amount of jalapeno. I also tried to lighten by using low fat mexican cheese and low fat sour cream. The recipe was very good, but could have been better if it was moister. Next time I will add taco sauce to the chicken/turkey to moisten it. I will also add an extra half cup of sour cream. This recipe will be four forks then.

This recipe is awesome! I did the whole corn tortilla thing, and even tho it's time consuming, def worth it! These were very tasty!

Rating: 4
Please use corn tortillas and soften them in the oil. The taste is so much richer than flour. Corn and chile are meant to pair up. This is so much better than my mother's turkey suprise. If you dislike the idea of oil, steam them and dip them in the sauce, but trust me, the corn tortilla in oil is the best. use real crema to garnish. Mix 1 cup of heavy (Not sterilized) cream @ room temp combine with 1 TBS cultured butter milk and let it set covered for 24 hours. It's the same as Creme Fraiche, but make your own. It's cheaper.

This dish is awesome. I made a couple of modifications, to slightly reduce the fat and increase the flavor. For fat reduction I used Diane's 98% fat free flour tortillas and didn't fry them at all, as well as reduced fat sour cream. I'm not an anti-fat person, and honest, these mods don't leave you feeling like it's a diet dish at all! I used La Victoria enchilada sauce, whose first ingredient is chile, instead of the others whose first ingredient is tomato. And I used Asadero cheese instead of the Monterey Jack. I added a teaspoon of pimenton, in addition to the chipotles, to up the smokiness without further increasing the heat. Utterly yummy.

This meal has become the first taste of Mexican food for many New Zealand folks here and they are in love. This being my 3rd time making this dish I found that if I flavored the chicken breasts with (apx. 1/2 cup) Coriander, (1 Table spoon) Cumin, and fresh cracked Black Pepper the flavors are a welcome otherwise the sauce is the only dominant flavor.

This was an excellent dish! I made the Plum Roasted Turkey from this site last Sunday night, and even though excellent..and almost finished, I was able to get three cups of shredded turkey off the carcass. :) In any event, I used 12-inch flour tortillas, and rolled each enchilada up "blintz" like. I also made my own homeade red enchilada sauce..and used a mix of cheddar and monterey jack cheese in the filling, adding 1/4 cup of green onions in with the regular chopped onion. Also, if you have fresh plum tomatoes, and want to cut down on prep time to finely dice them...cut them into fourths, and give them a few pulses in the food processor if you have one :) they diced perfectly! All in all, I will be making this dish again and again and again. It got raves from everyone, including myself :)

This is the best use for the leftover bird. Excellent flavor. Needed a little more chipotle sauce. four forks

This dish is excellent. I think it would be just as wonderful with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The only thing I will do differently next time is to add a bit more cheese and much more cilantro to the filling and the sauce could definitely handle a couple more chipotles, what the recipe calls for doesn't make it very hot. I will definitely make it again, my guests raved!!!

I created the "after work" version of this recipe using rotisserie baked chicken and canned tomatoes. Also, I cut down on the fat by using lite sour cream, one less cup of cheese and fat free tortillas. Green salad and white rice on the side made this a perfect dinner. Highly recommenced

This is terrific! I've used both leftover turkey or about three large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, poached amd shredded, and both worked well. I like using a green enchilada sauce, and I also used canned tomatoes (about 1 28-ounce can) and microwaved the corn tortillas in damp paper towels instead of frying. A dollop of sour cream on top of the spicy sauce is good, too. Wonderful comfort food and good for casual entertaining.

Really good enchiladas. I froze some leftover T'giving dark turkey meat and it was great. I used one dried chipotle, seeds removed, and still a bit too spicy for my family. I also used LF yogurt in place of sour cream (rather than making trip to store), which was fine. I'll definitely make again.

This is my new day after Thanksgiving tradition. My family loved these and they were super easy to make. I didn't have any chipotles, so I just left them out. Still excellent, although not spicy at all. However, I will not wait until next Thanksgiving to make them again.

A great, easy recipe. It tastes like what you get in a restaurant, only better, because the meat and other ingredients are higher quality. I made this with left-over Thanksgiving turkey, but I can see how chicken would be just as good. The chipotle chiles should be chopped fine, since they are VERY spicy. But, they add a nice and very essential taste.

An excellent recipe -- another suggestion is to buy rotisserie chickens from the supermarket and shred the meat. The roasted flavor you get is a very nice addition to the dish. Several tablespoons of mole sauce or chopped chipotles added to the mix is a great way to please those guests with a spicier palate.

This was a real hit at my house. Like many others, I substituted canned tomatos and microwaved my tortillas. It also holds well - I made it one day and didn't cook and serve it till the next day. I also added a bit of garlic to the sauce.

I made this last week with left over turkey and it came out wonderfully!

Being in a big hurry, I cut ten tortillas in half, dipped them in the sauce instead of frying, layered half over the 1/2 cup sauce, spread chicken mixture on top, then covered with the remaining tortillas. Very easy casserole.

With only a few changes this is a 4 plus. I used chicken, not turkey, and steamed the corn tortillas in the microwave. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a can of diced. Everything else was as stated and it was a big winner. What a great easy dish.

I have 2 very small children and this was an extremely easy and quick dish with a lot of flavor. I substituted chicken instead of turkey and it turned out great!

These were very good. I did not have fresh tomatoes so I substituted canned. I also used white cheddar because I already had that. I also do not fry my tortillas in oil before I make enchiladas.

I love this recipe! If you don't like hot food, don't make recipes that use chipolte chilies. I made these the other day with leftover turkey and mixed in Garlic, White Cheddar, and Chipolte Mashed Potatoes (on this site). They were great! I've also made these with chicken.

I did not fry the tortillas in oil, I didn't add peppers the sause was already fairly spicy. I poured the whole sauce out, before I read the line about leaving some for later. Wow this was really good.

Very easy and very tasty (especially the filling). I agree that the quality of the enchilada sauce makes a hughe difference. The heat factor is a matter of preference, but some canned enchilada sauces can be disgustingly salty. Better to make it yourself, which is also very easy and only dirties one small sauce pan.

Anytime I want to gather my friends at my house, I just make these enchiladas and tell everyone what time they will be done. Since I only have turkey around thanksgiving, I have used chicken breasts, ground turkey, and leftover grilled chicken. All three are wonderful.

I should have done like some of the other reviewers did here and used green chiles instead of the chipotle. It was sooo hot!! The taste was overpowered by the heat. These were just okay. I have used other enchilada recipes that were better, using homemade enchilada sauce. I used chicken instead of turkey. This is not a recipe I would repeat.

How pleased you'll be with this recipe depends on the quality of the canned enchilada sauce you get. My husband and I thought the dish was bland, but we like sauce with a lot of kick. My in-laws from Wisconsin loved it, though, and they found it hot enough that they wanted extra sour cream on the side--no offense to any cheeseheads reading this! :) If you end up with a bland sauce, you can always add more chipotles and throw in some extra onion. The chicken mixture for inside the enchiladas is wonderful! I have used it with a green sauce instead of one suggested here and got rave reviews from our guests.

We received a twenty lb. turkey as a Christmas gift. That big guy was really taking up space in the freezer so I roasted him (using an Epicurious recipe,of course). We had the usual leftover lunch fares, but twenty pounds of turkey for three people is a lot of bird! Tonight I made this dish with a few changes. I didn't have time to make the enchiladas,so I used flour tortillas and layered it all in a casserole. The only content changes I made were,used one can diced tomatoes and one can diced tomatoes with chilis instead of the fresh tomatoes. I used a little more cheese to keep it from drying out and added a little garlic. Easy,quick and very good! I will make this again using chicken when I don't have turkey.

Great recipe. I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with chili seasoning for the fresh tomatoes. The chipotle chilies are hard to find, so I used a can of green chilies. Because my boyfriend doesn't like sour cream, I used some of the sauce to hold the turkey mix together, and I topped my enchiladas with sour cream. I also recommend using a Mexican cheese blend - monterey jack, asadero, queso quesadilla and cheddar - and I recommend cooking the tortillas in a pan without oil. I made these enchiladas a month ago, and my boyfriend has been talking about them since. I'm going to try the recipe with chicken for the Super Bowl. Go Ravens!

I was looking for a recipe for crab enchiladas. When I did not find one, I settled on substituting crab for turkey in this recipe. It was great! I used imitation crab for my first try last night and mixed red onion with the filling, white onion in the sauce. Delicious! My husband really loved it!

Yum!!!! Even my very picky 7 & 11 year old daughters loved this one. BEWARE: Leave yourself plenty of time to make this. I used frozen leftover thanksgiving turkey. When I tasted the sauce right before I made the actual enchilades, I didn't like it and thought everyone that had reviewed it was crazy. But once they baked, they were oh so good. I used canned chopped green chilis. My daughters think they don't like tomatoes, so I used half the stated amount of canned tomatoes, and supplemented with an equal amount of tomato sauce, less tomato chunks for them to see and think they needed to pick out.

I forgot to buy the chipotle chilies, however it turned out awesome! I substituted with canned green chilies and used twice as much. I didn't have enough turkey so I used 1 part lightly seasoned ground beef and 2 parts dark meat turkey. The combo turned out great, It wouldn't have been the same without the ground beef. Be generous with the cilantro and definitely use mexican cheese on top. It makes twice as much which was great since we couldn't get enough of it.

The recipe as written sounds excellent, so are my changes.Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a 15 oz.can of diced tomatoes and a 15 oz. can of Italian stewed tomatoes and mashed them down after the sauce cooked. I warmed and mixed 1 C. of garlic mashed potatoes with 8 oz. of light cream cheese and 1/4 cup parmessan instead of cheese and sr. cream. I added 1 extra cup of turkey and make 16 enchiladas, putting 3 cups of sauce on 8 (2 pans) with 1 cup extra. I also used cumin in both parts. The odd sounding mix makes the enchiladas easy to roll and isn't greasy.

You can substitute reduced fate cheese and light sour cream in this recipe without diminishing its great taste.

This is something I've done for over ten years, using leftover turkey from Thanksgiving to make Enchiladas. I usually end up with about ten packages of four to be freezer bound. I thru it together never really having a recipe. When I perused this recipe, I responded, how did they know I do this. Anyway, tried this version instead of my own throw it together thing. I really enjoyed the outcome. I used the white onions for the enchilada sauce as recommended. But I used green onions to add to the turkey meat. And since it isn't Thanksgiving yet I ended up using chicken instead of Turkey. I also used a Mexican white cheese for the topping of the enchiladas instead of Jack cheese. I did use Jack cheese in the meat mix. Husband loved it as did I and will definetly make this recipe again. Vicky T. Anderson/Chapman Bend. OR.

Very tasty. Love enchiladas with chipotle peppers. The food grinder for the turkey is a good idea.

These enchiladas were fabulous! I've never made enchiladas before but I had a few pieces of leftover grilled chicken in the fridge so I started searching for what to do with it. Found this recipe and thought what the heck - how bad can it be? Served it with a salad and spanish rice. My husband even loved it, and he is not a fan of Mexican food (except for Taco Bell - go figure). Had leftovers for lunch the next day, reheated great in the microwave. Can't wait to make them again after Thanksgiving with all those turkey leftovers. Don't pass this recipe by - YOU WILL LOVE IT!

We LOVED this recipe! Made a double batch, froze an extra meal--it got a little hotter, but still GREAT! I will cut down on the hot peppers--but then we're older! VERY GOOD! Sauce also makes GREAT taco topping!

An excellent way to use up those leftovers. My entire family loved the recipe. Make it as mild or hot as they will tolerate. I found it easy to make too, which is a relief after cooking all week to prepare the big feast.

I didn't have plum tomatoes and substituted a can of undiluted cream of cheddar soup. Also used flour tortillas. My family it was a "keeper recipe".

This recipe is wonderful. Fantastic way to utilize the leftover turkey. It can be made as spicy as you desire by modifying the peppers. The cilantro really makes the dish. I used a food grinder and ground up the turkey into a medium chunk.

We finished off the last of this year's Thanksgiving turkey tonight with these enchiladas. My husband and I loved them. After several days of leftovers, it was nice to have a meal that didn't seem like a leftover. I'll definitely be making these again, and long before next Thanksgiving!

I panicked when I could not find this recipe in my Nov'98 issue of Bon Appetit, the page was torn out! Everyone in my family was asking me if I'll make enchiladas the day after Thanksgiving again, obviously they're memorable!

This is the best way to get my family to eat left-over turkey. My husband thought it was tremendous instead of the sad turkey and stuffing open faced sandwich!

We love this recipe! We don't wait until we have leftover turkey to make it - we grill or poach boneless chicken or turkey when we're hungry for these very tasty enchiladas!

Finally a great way to get rid of those leftovers! And they don't even taste leftover!
