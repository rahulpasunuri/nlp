Lamest. Recipe. Ever.

Disappointed to see the Coleslaw dressing was not homemade, only doctored up. I haven't tried it (don't care for the sloppy store bought stuff). I think I'll keep looking for a Horseradish Coleslaw recipe

I think the sarcasm you refered to has more to do with stupidity, than anything else.

I guess the sarcasm from the other reviewer has to do with not noticing at all that this is to go with the roast beef wraps, but this--by itself--perks up store bought coleslaw, as long as it's not the too-sweet kind. It's good with roast beef sandwiches made with the rosemary mayo on this site.

Hey at least they chopped the tyme, but it's difficult to buy chopped, in most stores that is...
