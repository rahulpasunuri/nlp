I followed the advice of the last poster and used skim milk with fat free half and half. I also added the cinnamon stick and the orange rind (not dried, about 1/4 of a naval orange). It is AMAZING! I didn't even need to fruit added, but I put a few nuts on top.

I have never been a big fan of rice pudding, BUT since I had been craving it of late, I gave in and used this recipe to stay on the side of lowfat/healthy. I used jasmine rice 2c skim milk & 1c fat free half and half, then added to the milk and rice mixture while it was cooking :1 cinnamon stick, a large piece of dried orange rind (zest)1/4 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I used 1/3c splenda with enough sugar to make 1/2c total. I used 1 whole egg and 1 4oz container of egg beaters whites. also adding 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to eggs along with vanilla. I used a dried fruit mix that contained pineapples, cherries, cranberries, apples and raisin. I added a little extra skim milk(for my personal taste) before devouring. I THINK I'M HOOKED!!!!!

This was very good, especially for being a healthy version. It was really creamy enough for me, the butter and cream that other recipes call for is really superfluous. That said, I did use half 1% and half whole milk (ran out of 1%). I also threw in a cinnamon stick while the rice/milk mixture was cooking, subbed cinnamon and nutmeg for cardamon, and regular raisins for the golden raisins and cherries. It was delicious, it turned out thick and creamy. I will definitely try it as written when I have all the ingredients on hand.

I made this with short grain white rice instead of long grain, whole milk instead of lowfat and two whole eggs instead of egg whites. I substituted cinnamon for the cardamon and omitted the cherries and raisins. Basically I was looking for a good, basic rice pudding recipe and this was definitely it. Creamy and delicious but not too sweet. Came out perfect!

I used about 1 1/2 cups leftover cold cooked rice and continued with the recipe> I also use two eggs rather than one egg and 2 whites. I used long grain rice as the recipe states but I cooked it to 170 deg and that was not long enough. 180 degrees would be more like it. I also added a little more salt. Having some non-fat half and half on hand, I used that in combination with the milk and it was wonderful.The addition of cardomom really made it come to life. A keeper!

I have been looking for a creamy rice pudding recipe for a long time and this is the best, I didnt have any raisins so I doubled the cherries it was excellent, make sure you use short grain rice.

The best rice pudding we've ever had!! I didn't have the dried tart cherries at home, so I omitted them, adding more raisins and topped it off with some cinnamon. I gave some friends a taste and they too raved and wanted the recipe.

My husband and I both enjoyed this pudding. I had no problem with it being runny, it was actually quite thick. I accidently added too much sugar, but it ended up tasting great. I only used cherries and thought the cardomom was a great addition.

I had no trouble with it thickening but it was not as some people may prefer. I used 1/2 tsp of good ceylon cinnamon instead of the cardamom and it was wonderful. Also, I ran the cherries through the food pro for a corse chop( to about the size of the raisins). A really good change of pace for rice pudding.

I really liked this recipe, but my husband didn't. He thought is wasn't creamy enough or sweet enough. I wonder if it would make a difference if whole milk was substituted for the 1%?

This wasn't very interesting. It's a lot of trouble for something that isn't particularly good.

After reading the other review, I used only 2 cups milk and 2 whole eggs - great!.... also very good with dried cranberries and with dates

I havn't made this yet, but am about to as I have dried fruit that I've been waiting to do something with; this seems quite appealing. However, after just reading the review from Reston, I think that the reviewer must have added far too much water. The recipe calls for 1 cup, *in a 2 quart pot*, and I believe the previous reviewer must have gotten confused. This is, after all, the common ratio of 2 parts water to 1 part rice, and I find it unlikely that this will turn out soupy. This looks scrumptious, and I can't wait to try it.

This pudding didn't thicken up nearly enough -- I let the milk/rice mixture cook for almost 1 1/2 hours and it still didn't resemble 'thick soup', and also spent over half an hour (not "one to 2 minutes"!) stirring it after adding the egg/seasoning mix before it hit 170 degrees. The result tasted okay after chilling, but it doesn't have the consistency I expect from rice pudding. I'll definitely have to keep looking for a good recipe.
