This is a great and simple recipe for a (moderately) health fruit salad. I scaled this recipe up to serve at a party, and the guests loved it.

Great taste and very simple. I used mint from my garden, but fresh mint from the produce dept would probably work. One 16 oz carton and a reasonable number of grapes serves 4. Adjust sugar mint and vanilla to taste.

Great, simple fruit salad. What really makes it great is the mint. When making it again, I will use more fruits than just strawberries and grapes.

I have made this dish many times and it has always been a success. No leftovers, ever.

I made this for Mother's Day dinner. It was so delicious and beautiful to look at. The mint added a nice bit of zip with the vanilla and sugar. Will definitely make this again and again.

A really nice, light, fresh, end to a meal. Seemed like a somewhat unusual combination, but it works. Very easy, but doesn't keep.

This was a HIT! Refreshing and perfect. I limited sugar to a sprinkle and added a bit more vanilla. Got rave reviews. Wonderful

Good recipe for a fine simple dessert! This will become a standby when a simple fruit dessert is called for.

This is wonderful and I have been serving it as a dessert for a couple of years now, along with some crispy lemon cookies. Everyone loves it.

Love this!! I cut the sugar (the fruit was sweet on its own) but kept the same amount of mint. Had it after mussels - very refreshing and deelish.

Love this salad! Next time I make it I am going to add blueberries, bananas and toasted almonds.

Excellent and extra yummy - my guest was a bit apprehensive when it was described to him but LOVED it! I served it with vanilla almond biscotti. A real winner and too easy for words.

I love this recipe. The mint is a really delicious complement to the grapes and strawberries. I make this throughout the summer.

I made this for an impromptu get-together last night and it was great. I used orange-bergamot mint from my garden which married so well with the fragrance as well as the flavor of the fruits. Easy and impressive!

This sounds like a very odd combination, but it was delicious and refreshing. I served it with some Reggiano parmesan, blue cheese, and water crackers.
