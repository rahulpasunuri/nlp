most american butter is somewhere around 90-91% fat, the rest being milk solids and water, whereas european style butter has a higher percentage of fat, around 94% i believe. i've seen it in specialty shops and markets -- it's usually imported, tho there are some local manufacturers, in vermont i think -- but in any case, it's pricey, so i've never tried using it. and i find that the pastries i make are tasty and probably fatty enough already! :-)

Sounds like personal size mincemeat--yum! I'll have to try these, but can anyone explain what European style butter is? I wasn't aware there were differences. Thanks!

These pies have been part of our Christmas giveaway packs for three years now and everyone absolutely loves them. Where the recipe calls for brandy or whiskey, however, I always use Chambord (raspberry liquer). I also recomend always using a European-style butter when baking pastries.
