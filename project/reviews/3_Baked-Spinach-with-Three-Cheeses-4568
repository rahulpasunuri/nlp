Really loved this recipe although I'm not typically one for baking. The second time I made this I used it as inspiration only and WOW! My family loves a bit of kick so I sauteed the spinach in a spicy garlic oil. For the cheese mixture I sauteed finely chopped shallots & red peppers, feta and a four cheese italian mix as well as chopped olives, fresh dill & basil. Seriously, you can do what ever you want with this recipe. Next time I'll throw in some sun dried tomatoes. A great meal or side

12/25/2008 - served as an appetizer and it went in a flash! My only complaint was that it was a little runny on the bottom and I thought I dried the spinach really good. Didn't affect the flavor though. I used 1 teaspoon dried dill because I ran out of fresh for another recipe.

Delicious and easy. I sauteed shallots in olive oil and then added spinach, just to wilted stage. Squeezed dry and refrigerated overnight. Then added feta and pepper jack, breadcrumbs and egg. Baked 20 minutes, sprinkled with parmesan and broiled quickly.

I, too, sauteed the onions and substituted grated white cheddar and parmesan for the Edam. What a great accompaniment for Moroccan pork tenderloin pears and apricots.

I made a low cal version of this with what I had on hand - reduced fat feta, goat cheese, lowfat cottage cheese. I wilted the spinach in the microwave first, then threw it in a pan with a hint of olive oil to get the remaining liquid out. Really delicious and didn't taste nearly as low cal / low fat as it was!

Next time I will lightly saute the onions.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! It's very easy and quick to make (the way I do it) and many friends who we've shared it with have asked for it again. I can't imagine anyone rating it less than 3 forks, unless they don't like spinach, and in that case - why make a spinach recipe???!!!

I make a similar recipe all the time. The trick with almost any cooked-spinach preparation is to first steam, cool, and squeeze the moisture out of the spinach. Chop coarsely and then sauté with onion or other appropriate aromatic and replenish the lost liquid by slowly adding cream, milk, or chicken stock (or a combination). Monterey jack with hot peppers is the cheese of choice for me in this dish. It's an outstanding side for a nicely cooked piece of prime beef.

Was surprised with the mixed reviews-- I make this every Thanksgiving for my vegetable-hating uncle (oddly, the only veggie he likes is spinach!), and everyone loves it. Just be careful about excess moisture and you'll be fine!

It would need a lot of adjustments in order to ever make it again.

It was the hit of our party along with the Green Beans and Red Bell peppers recipe. Had several requests for an encore.

This recipe was a huge disappointment. It was just ok when it was still hot; when it cooled it was gross.

This turned out blander than I expected. I forgot to add the dill though which might explain it.

Wonderful. Moist and cheesy.Makes a pleasant and different way to serve spinach.
