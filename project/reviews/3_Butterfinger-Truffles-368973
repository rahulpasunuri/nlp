Fabulous and very easy!! Followed recipe and they turned out great. Only changes I would make would be to dust them with cocoa powder before putting them on the prepared cookie sheet. Otherwise, they stuck to the aluminum foil. Made them for a cookie exchange, will make them again for holiday party.

After seeing this recipe in the December 2011 issue I made them immediately. They were yummy... but the texture was weird and they were VERY awkward looking. They didn't completely set- and it seems like I wasn't the only one who had that problem. Will not make again.

meh. the butterfingers added some texture, but the flavor was overwhelmed by the 60% chocolate that i used. i didn't really care for the texture of these. i prefer the enrobed truffles that i made last year from this site. they were far more work, but considerably better. and these did not ship well.

This are yummy but messy. I also had a hard time rolling them and could not get the peanuts to stick so I think I would skip that next time.

These were yummy, but I don't think I would give them as a Christmas gift as suggested. The ball shape only keeps its form when refrigerated. Also, as Sniggum mentioned, the butterfinger flavor and crunch was pretty much lost in the rich texture and flavor of the truffle.

I followed the recipe to the letter and got a truffle mixture that never stiffened up even after a night of chilling. I managed to get something close to a ball shape with the help of the cocoa powder, but the truffle would start to slump as soon as I put it down. I chilled them again, but they are like eating a wad of frosting and also not very "Butterfingery". Not worth the effort

Yum! So easy and elegant looking. I used a Trader Joe's Bittersweet Chocolate that was very mild in taste (54% cacao). These would be great rolled in powdered sugar too.
