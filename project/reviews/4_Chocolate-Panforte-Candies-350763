I've made these twice and they're amazing! I've also used agave nectar both times to make them vegan, which worked well.

Made this yesterday. I toasted and chopped the hazelnuts and removed the skins. I used a few extra figs and chopped them up and I used a third of a cup of orange juice. I pressed the topping down into the chocolate which caused the chocolate to spread without having to tap them. So that was the candies done. And they are lovely. As other people have noted there is extra fig and nut mix. So I melted the rest of the chocolate that was in the bag of chips and added it to the extra fig and nut mix. I then stirred it into a slightly soft vanilla ice cream to make chocolate pan forte ice cream. Really nice.

These were really easy to make and pretty tasty. I think the hazelnuts need to be chopped up and the figs chopped smaller.

This candy recipe turned out famously. When I was making this recipe I was concerned that there was too heavy of a clove overture, but after it had chilled with the chocolate, it blended seamlessly. **Notes for next time: the filaberts need to be almost over-toasted to ensure they still have a crunch after they are mixed with the figs. Also, the recipe creates almost double the panforte topping that you need for 14 candies. The chocolate does need to be slapped rather hard to level out... perhaps another 30 seconds would help to temper the chocloate to a higher liquidity next time.
