I agree that these are VERY sweet cookies. and the sugar should be reduced, and the last half of the chocolate chips could be eliminated (or substituted with walnuts or pecans). I would cut out 1/2 cup of sugar.. and only use 1/2 cup of chocolate chips melted. Otherwise, quite tasty.

I am a huge fan of this type of cookie, and this is the best recipe I've used to date. I found this recipe pretty much foolproof. I used a hand mixer and was a little imprecise with measurements and these STILL came out darn near perfect. I think the cream of tartar and cornstarch help give the perfect amount of chew that really makes these cookies special. Of course, I'll have to get creative at Passover since cornstarch is a no-no that week. I whipped these up as a light dessert for Valentine's Day and they vanished in a few hours. I will definitely be adding these to my permanent collection of recipes.

Quite amazing, delicious & easy. Followed the recipe to a tee, but cooked them on parchment paper instead of spraying the pans. Easy cleanup.

I made these a few months ago for the first time and they were amazing--delicious and super attractive plump morsels of silvery-brown. 4+ forks. Just made them tonight and they flattened out while baking and burned on the edges. Not fit to be served. Air's too humid? Overmixed? Or could it be all about the spray--I ran out and just slid a stick of butter on the trays to leave a thin film. Anyway, very sad.

Light and rich, full chocolate flavor. Made these for a potluck and everyone's eye got wide as they tried them. Easy to make. I'm sending this recipe to all my baking-challenged friends.

excellent! i have made twice so far, the second time swapping the cornstarch for potato starch so they would be passover-friendly. i scooped the batter into a ziploc and piped the cookies out, making them on the small size which yielded about 24 cookies. only adjustment was lowering the cooking time by a few minutes. got rave reviews from everyone!

These are fudgy and excellent cookies. No flour in these and not too bad for those on a diet. I was a little concerned about the texture when everything was mixed together, as they seemed kind of crumbly. The cookies came out a bit more lumpy looking than the photo, but were definitely a wonderful texture and super chocolatey. I used basic supermarket available Ghiardelli cocoa, and a mix of Toll House and Ghiardelli chips, and results were great. The note says they're best the day they're made, but a day later I'm still enjoying them. I don't expect the texture to hold up more than another day or so though.

DELICIOUS!!! I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. But it was still way too sweet. I know that without a great amount of sugar, the cookie dough will be very runny, so i think next time I will add just 3/4-1 cup of sugar, dark chocolate without sugar, and about 1/4 cups flour. IF you have a sweet tooth, then I'd say just stick to the recipe.

Well, prior to baking these may look like the "presents" your neighbor's teacup chihuahua leaves on your front lawn. Appearances will be forgiven, however, once you taste these delicious cookies. And really while you might be tempted, despite the directions you don't have to feel compelled to polish them off on the first day: better then yes, but not bad on day two either as long as you don't overbake.

My husband vowed he wouldn't touch these because he doesn't like meringue cookies. He liked them! The inside is really like a brownie. Love that they're gluten free. Will be making these again and again. I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate.

These were delicious! Mine didn't look as pretty as the photo and they started to burn the last couple minutes:(. Next time I'll cook them on 300 for a little longer...

Mmmm...I brought these to a dinner party and everyone was impressed by the chewy, fudginess. Serve them with vanilla ice cream. They were surprisingly easy to make. I will certainly make these again.

These cookies were excellent. I've tried various chocolate meringue cookies in the past, including Payard's flourless chocolate-walnut cookies on this site, and these are by far the best. They were crisp on the outside, rich and fudgy on the inside, and just plain satisfying. Highly recommended!
