These are the best tyropitas I've ever had. Sure, they're a bit labor intensive and if you haven't worked with phyllo dough before it can be a bit of a challenge. But so worth it! My family calls them "little cheesy pillows of happiness & joy" -- and they truly are!

I made this was had a TON of filling left over. No clue what I did wrong but they tasted very good. :) Now that I know how to work with phyllo, I'll try some stuff on my own. It is time consuming but that's the only negative I have for this.

I put these together in advance, froze them and then baked them for an Open House to celebrate our son's return from Iraq. Followed the recipe exactly and they were gone in less than the time it took to make 'em! Four forks indeed!

I did it!! I am so proud of myself! Like a previous rater, I vowed years ago I would never work with phyllo again. But this seemed a little more simple than other recipes I have viewed. I followed the recipe exactly, including the phyllo hints, and it came out just perfect. My husband and nephew loved them. I have a better understanding of phyllo and am willing to do other things now.

I swore I would never work with phyllo again, I have done an about face, these were delicious, but time comsumming, but worth the effort. I used only 2 eggs as 4 seemed a bit much.
