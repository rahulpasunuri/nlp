Very good - used as an appetizer on toasted sourdough bread at a Christmas party. Used anchovy paste instead of fresh anchovies but otherwie kept the same recipe. Tasty.

Very tasty! It was missing a flavor though, so I added some parsley and a little lemon juice and that fixed it right up.

Very pleasant on toasted french bread and some wine...

I use it to marinate chicken (without the tuna)- then sautee it. Yummy mediterranean twist!

It's great, but my old Julia Childs' version from Vogue Food (sometime in the 70's)also called for Sesame Tahini, but since I have lost the recipe, I'm not sure how much. Do you have a reprint of that recipe????Thanks.
