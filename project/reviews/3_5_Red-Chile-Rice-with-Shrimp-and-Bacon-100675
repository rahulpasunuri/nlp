To the cook from San Antonio del Mar, YES, there is such a chile known as the "Santa Fe Grande chile" or "guero chile." You might want to research before you post next time...

Amazing! Got the New Mexican Red Chiles, made the salsa fresh, and followed the recipes as written. Was told by one guest that it was the best rice he has even eaten in his life! I would recommended doubling the salsa recipe. As long as you are going to all the trouble, you should have some extra to enjoy with chips.

I'm not yet overly impressed with it but it's not bad. I was worried that it didn't have enough flavour, so I added some dried coriander, black olives, capers and white wine. Perhaps the cocktail shrimp I used were of poor quality, I could hardly taste them. The salsa was very good though. And I think you have to use medium-grain rice to obtain a creamy texture.

First of all, they're New Mexico chiles and there is about a 1000% difference in heat. Not all chiles are hot. New Mexico chiles are not, chipotles are smoked jalapeños and don't even have the same taste and are very spicy. There is a scale of heat levels of chiles and the two are about 8 entries apart. There is no such thing as Santa Fe chile.

Could someone tell me what the difference is between Sante Fe Peppers and Chipotles. I used the latter and even cutting down on the amount the salsa was very hot. Loved the flavor with chipotle, I had to dilute it with mild salsa so my husband could eat it. Otherwise the dish was delicious and my husband asked me to be sure to keep the recipe in my frequent use file.

This was a great recipe and very easy to make. I used red chile sauce (ala tamale sauce) and mixed it with what I had left in the fridge. I also used pre-cooked shrimp and I cooked it on the stove, not in the oven. It was very flavorful!

Just one word: Yummy. I didn't follow the advice of reviewer and make more of the salsa so I had to go back to the store and get more ingredients. Like I said: Yummy:-)

Followed this recipe to the letter and found it to be dry and boring. Might be OK as a side dish without the shrimp. I could think of many better uses for shrimp.

My oven is broken, so I made this on the stove and it came out great. I just added the shrimp (used Rock shrimp) and let them steam with the rice. I also added zest and juice of 1/2 lime for extra zing. Everyone loved it!

Great dish. So simple to make. I used store bought salsa(pace picante), and it still turned out delicious. A MUST TRY!

We loved this dish! The shrimp are perfect. I used store-bought salsa and went a little heavy on the fresh cilantro. Yummy!!!!!!

So-o-o-o good! The flavor was deep and delicious and, I agree, the shrimp came out very tender and flavorful. I made the salsa (a must) but instead of broiling the chilis, I used one and a half tablespoons of homemade chili powder that was brought to me from Santa Fe which made the taste even more special. The fresh cilantro really rounded it out. Epicurious rocks!

I have made this recipe at least 4 times in the past month, after trying it. Such a great recipe. The shrimp comes out sooo tender and perfect. Do yourself a favor and make the salsa to go with it. This is a minimum 3 forks with storebought salsa (from the REFRIGERATED CASE), but with the supplied salsa recipe, easily 4 forks. The salsa adds a great taste to this recipe. Thanks, Epicurious!

This was a great really easy recipe. I used arborio rice, added a chopped red pepper and some red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning to spruce it up a bit but it was really easy and really good.

I used the salsa in the recipe and although alone the salsa was too vinegary, in the rice it was great. I used 1 lb. of bay shrimp and sauteed the rice in olive and canola oils. I served bacos at the table to add on top. I'm sure the bacon is perfect in this. On the side I served a can of pinto beans and their liquid simmered with garlic, oregano and a bay leaf and a Mexican caesar salad. I look forward to using pieces of chicken thigh or breast another time. My husband said "there's a shrimp in every bite"- he LOVED this, even with bacos.

Came out great. Instead of taking all the time to make the Mellow Red Chile Salas, I simply used fresh salsa and that worked well too.

Loved this recipe--Very flavorful. We made it as a side dish, and skipped the shrimp, as part of a Mexican Buffet and it was a hit. Would make a great main course with shrimp. It was also great the next day used with leftover Black Bean Ancho Chili used as a "black beans and rice" dish.
