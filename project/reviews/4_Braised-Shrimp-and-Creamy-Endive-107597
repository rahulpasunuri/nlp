I actually hesitated at making this recipe initially, thinking it would be bland or just blah, but then my mother pushed, and I made it. WOW! Great dish. Very elegant, rich seeming, but the endive and lemon give is a lightness. I will definitely be making this again. Fabulous dish.

This is an awesome dish, both as an appetizer and main course. I make it pretty much exactly as written when served as an appetizer, but have to bump it up a bit when tossed with a half box of angel hair to serve as a main dish for 2. We usually will also have enough leftover for a lunch portion if I make it for dinner, too. I usually use chives and parsley, a generous cranking of black pepper, and a touch of fresh nutmeg, which really allows it to stand alone as a pasta sauce. I do add a little more cream to coat the pasta, as well. I don't make it frequently, but when I do, I'm never disappointed.

This is simply divine. The tiny amount of sugar really takes the bitterness out of the endive. It's a snap to make, and I use fat-free half and half to keep the calories low. The cream, of course, is sweeter.

Nice delicate needed a bit more lemon juice, also impooved with some fresh grindings of black peppercorns. Nice with New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Worthwile for a simple company appetizer.

This is a very simple but tasty dish. The interplay of flavors between the shrimp and endive is wonderful. It's important to use large, fresh shrimp. Nice as a light entree or as an appetizer.

Gave it four forks because of simplicity and ease - this took me hardly any time! I substituted the endive with asparagus, as another reviewer suggested, and it was delicious.

I really enjoyed this. I thought it was delicate but flavourful. Had it with a very light, dry white wine from South Africa. It was very pale to look at, but a sprinkle of parsley seemed enough to solve that.

Served this with olive oil-chive mashed potatoes -- everyone raved. Only problem was bringing more color to the plate. Braising the shrimp kept them tender and delicious.

Awesome recipe...I substituted fresh asparagus the second time and it was even better.

This recipe was delicious; even though I made a mistake in not letting the juices evaporate enough while cooking the endive -- so it ended up a little soupy. Next time I will cook the endive with the lid off--I like the tender crunch. I also think I will try this recipe with diagonally sliced celery rather than endive (a lot less expensive).

Very disappointing! Exceptionally bland. When I read the recipe, I thought the flavor of the shrimp would carry it. It didn't.

Wonderful. This recipe served 4 as an appetizer. The shrimp takes on a lobster-like flavor. Although the amount of cream and butter is low, the texture of the braised endive makes it seem much richer. For color, a sprinkling of paprika might be nice. I will also try it next time with a splash of Pernod or sherry.
