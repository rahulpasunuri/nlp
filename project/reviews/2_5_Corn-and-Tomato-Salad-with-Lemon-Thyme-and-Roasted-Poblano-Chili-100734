This was perfect for the Sept. vegetables I bought in the morning from the farmer's market. I used baby zucchini, ridged and baby crookneck, and the recipe was simple and delicious enought to do this gorgeous produce justice. I have a gas stove, so quickly roasted the poblano using a grill cover and then popped them in a bag - didn't bother too much with peeling, just put plastic bag over my hands for protection and pulled the guts out and chopped them up. A great way to let the produce shine

I feel almost bad commenting because i made so many substitutions, but i liked this dish. It had a nice flavor, they melded well together, when used as a side dish to my lemon thyme grilled chicken. I used frozen corn, a red bell pepper instead of the poblano chili, no zuccini, chives instead of scallions, and chopped roma tomatoes.

I seared some scallops in a really hot pan and served them on top of this salad. The salad was very flavorful and refreshing. Had leftovers the next day and was still excellent. The only trouble I had was browning the corn because I doubled the recipe and there was too much juice - didn't matter though, it was still excellent. I did cook the garlic with the corn mixture because I was afraid it would have that "raw" taste.

it tasted ok - but no one at the potluck commented on it, or asked for the recipe. NOT worth the time, re: cutting the fresh kernals and roasting the chile.
