Others may complain about these being cakey, but I was tired of the vanishing oatmeal cookies that were wafer thin. These were great -- I'd up the spices. I will also try the cranberries and almonds.

As previous reviews stated - too cakey! If I wanted a cake then I would make it instead. So well it isn't trash worthy I wouldn't bother making these again.

I just made these, but with cranberries, almonds and a few chocolate chips. They turned out great- soft, chewy, perfect. The only thing I'll say is that they took around 25 minutes to bake- a bit longer than expected. I'm also guessing that refrigerating the batter would help make them stay firm next time.

I have made these a couple of times thinking I goofed on the first time. They are not bad but they are not the raisen oatmeal cookies I am looking for ... the real deal ... The second time I substituted dried cranberries for raisins and that was a interesting and satisfying result ... although I'm still looking for the old fashioned raisin oatmeal cookie.

Like others have said, these were cakey rather than chewy and the flavour was rather bland. We were really disappointed. I wish I'd read the reviews before picking this recipe.

Rating: 1
the taste was okay, but like others have already said, they spread out way to much upon baking, and were way too thin. i would use a different recipe next time.

Made these using dried cherries and pecans along with the oatmeal. They were good but not chewy and not great. Another reviewer said they are cookies that happen to have oatmeal in them and I agree - nothing special.

These were really, really good. I'm not much a fan of oatmeal raisin, but these were too delicious for even me to reject. Described as a "superior" oatmeal raisin cookie, this recipe was a surprise hit. I made the cookies a little larger than directed (and refrigerated the dough), and didn't have any problems with spreading.

Should be called "Muffin Tops." I took the advice and refrigerated the dough, plus I added a bit of extra oats and cooked just a bit slower and longer. The result was nice, but a bit more like the top of a muffin than a typical oatmeal cookie. They're kind of fluffy and light, probably due to having both baking soda and baking powder.

Rating: 1
This recipe was a definite disappointment. The flavor of the cookies was fine, but the texture was definitely not. I didn't refrigerate the dough before I made the first batch, and they spread so thin that getting them off the cookie sheet was pretty hopeless. After that, I chilled the dough for half an hour and kept it in the refrigerator when I wasn't using it, and that helped a bit, but the cookies still spread out so much that it was a challenge to get them off the cookie sheet in any kind of cookie shape-- even with the chilled dough, I had to let them sit on the sheet for four minutes after baking before I could try to remove them, or they just fell to pieces. (I was going to add more flour, but I'd read comments about how they'd turn cake-like, so I didn't.) And as far as eating them goes--as I said, the taste was fine (a bit oversweet, but not terrible, and it could be courtesy of the fact that I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins and nuts), but the texture was the kind of unpleasant chewiness that sticks in your teeth. Definitely won't be making these again.

fabulous - especially with butterscotch chips. Next time I'll try them with the nuts and raisens and I'm sure they'll be delectable :) :)

This is a very boring oatmeal cookie recipe. It is a cookie that happens to have oatmeal in it. I would stick to the tried and true recipe on the back of the raisin box.

I've made these cookies many times...they are a household favorite! Putting the dough in the refridgerator is a must...it helps the consistency of the cookies. I also use extra spices (more cinnamon & I add ginger). Have used raisins sometimes and dried cranberries others and they are always great!

I found these to be more cake-like than chewy, which was a disappointment. People who like that texture gave it high marks, though.

here is how you can modify cookie texture CHEWY COOKIES * Use melted butter instead of creaming cold butter. * Remove cookies when they look slightly underdone. * Use a high ratio of brown sugar to white sugar, or substitue a little liquid sweetener such as honey, molasses, or corn syrup for the same amount of sugar. * Use more egg yolk instead of whole eggs. * Reduce the amount of baking soda or baking powder. These are leaveners which lend the cookie a more cakey texture. THIN, CRISPY COOKIES * Use butter as the main fat. It has a lower melting point than shortening, so the cookie will spread out thinner. * Use more white sugar than brown sugar. You could just use all white sugar. * Bake cookies until well done. PUFFY, CAKEY COOKIES * Use shortening instead of butter. * Make sure that you mix the shortening well with the sugars until it is very light and fluffy. * Use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. * Use more egg. * Use baking powder instead of baking soda for leavening. It makes the cookie puff up more.

I now know what everyone meant by "cakey". The cookies came out like muffin tops. The flavor was great, my whole family ate em up. They stayed nice and soft the next day. However I was also looking for a very chewy cookie. these are not chewy at all, definatley cakey, or muffin like. Definatley still worth a try. If anyone else who has rated this recipe and is also looking for that amazing chewy oatmeal cookie recipe. When you find it please post it!

cookies came out cakelike,as described in the other reviews, but for me that is what makes them soooo good. I added dried cranberries which gives them a little zing.

I have been hunting for an "old-fashioned" oatmeal cookie, which includes raisins and nuts. As I remove them from the oven, I can't stop eating them! I followed the recipe exactly using Kate's salted butter, and Billington's dark brown molasses sugar, which is now available in most of my local supermarkets. I have forever abandoned the horrible overly sweet and tasteless brown sugars. This has a rich molasses taste. The cookie is cakey and chewy around the edges. Cakey is the point! Not dry. Allspice added a nice touch. I baked one batch until darker and one batch lighter. Both delicious, the paler cookie is more cakelike.

Came out more like cake than a good chewy cookie. Batter too moist. Cookies came out to thin and flat.

These are not chewy. I would classify them as moist cakey. I was very disappointed, as was my husband. After baking half the batter, I added 4 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup oats to the remainder, and it gave the second batch more body, but still not chew.

The flavor of the dough was very good with the allspice, but I didn't like the texture of the baked cookie. Too cake-like and somewhat dry. Am going to search for my July 2003 B.A. and try the recipe suggested in there by another reviewer.

I don't know what everyone is complaining about: the cookies are described as "soft" and "cake-like", people-- you were warned! I'm not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but I couldn't stop nibbling as I baked. Once I was done, the cookies disappeared at record speed-- this is an excellent recipe. I think using freshly-ground allspice really made a difference.

I was unimpressed by this recipe. I expected a cookie, not a cakeie, so to speak. The texture was lifeless, and the flavor lacked strong character. Lessening the leavening agents could perhaps have saved this recipe.

I haven't tried this recipe, but have been on the quest for the perfect chewy oatmeal, raisin, and date cookie for years. I found it today in the July 2003 issue of Bon Appetit. It is very moist and chewy and EXCELLENT!!! Unfortunately, the recipe for Oatmeal cookies with raisins, dates, and walnuts is not listed on this site. I logged on just to share my raves for this particular recipe, but you'll have to get it from the magazine.

Double YUM.I am baking today in my Hong Kong kitchen sans hand-held mixer. I melted the butter, added the brown sugar and stirred to dissolve the sugar. Then I added the white sugar, and using a whisk, I incorporated room temp. eggs and milk. I poured the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirred to blend, and Voila! I always place the cookie sheet on a pizza stone for half the baking time. This technique insures that the cookies will have a lovely crisp bottom. Then I move the sheet up to the middle shelf and finish baking. I have baked oatmeal cookies for 40 years and these are A++--2-3 minutes of underbaking will guarantee a cheewy texture.

These were chewy and delicious - although cakey as another reviewer noted. However, quite by accident, I omitted the milk, and they are still worth making.

Rating: 2
This recipe has a high proportion of protein to starch because of the milk. This could be the reason so many people are having trouble with the texture. In addition, quick oats will generally produce a chewier cookie. Chilling the dough for a day or two will also help the final product remain softer after baking. Remember to bake at a slightly higher temp. for a shorter time if you want a chewy cookie. Good Luck!

I think the cookies came out exceptionally well - I didn't leave them in the oven as long as the recipe suggested and they were very chewy. They freeze well, so that you can always have homemade cookies on-hand. Needless to say, they usually don't make it to the freezer as my friends eat them all right away!

These cookies were not very chewy, and frankly, did not have the degree of oatmeal and raisin flavors that I want in a cookie. I was underwhelmed and felt like I had wasted my ingredients. That said, my wife did end up eating them all.

To ALL who eat these: You are right in saying these taste good but are missing the consistency to hold together after baking. My late Father taught me his secret oatmeal recipe and now, after much hesitation, I give it to you all: Add a cup of Kellog corn flakes and 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the recipe and see what it does to help it. Not only will it create thee perfect , chewy cookie of your dreams, it will be done without all the M&Ms or extra sugar some cooks have resorted to to fix this baby. Thats it. Hope you all remeber to share cooking tips in the future. Stay well and prosper. Stefano

For a number of years I was Technical Director of Schrafft's. I am now retired and I can say that Schrafft's had some of the finest recipes that any food company ever had. The oatmeal cookies sold 6 for $0.72 back in 1958. That was a pretty hefty price but they were worth it. Schrafft's had a surplus of chicken fat from their chicken processing operations and they substituted chicken fat for the butter. The cookies were just as good.

I had to add an additional 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup oats to thicken the dough enough to be able to use an ice cream scoop to make the cookies. The flavor was good, but I found the consistency to be more like that of a cake than a cookie - somewhat like a madeleine.

The key to these is letting them cool for a while before taking them off of the pan, otherwise they'll fall apart. Using chocolate chips adds a nice twist--cranberries are also nice with the walnuts. Great recipe!
