I put it on a homemade Italian bread that was rubbed with spices (garlic powder, salt, thyme, oregano, basil, minced dried red pepper, fresh black pepper) and rolled nearly flat before baking. Omitted the capers and anchovies; added a slice of Provolone cheese. One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.

Nice change from wet tuna salad.Did not add anchovies and it was still quite good.
