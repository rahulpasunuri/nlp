Loved this recipe. I added mushrooms to the sauce for an extra taste.

Made this with bone-in pork chops, so they took a little longer to cook, but they were finger-lickin' good. I loved the sauce so much that I poured it over my mashed potatoes too. Really delicious and easy.

One of the easiest Bon Appetit recipes I have ever tried. It was delicious and my husband loved it. So we will have it often. To solve the dilemna of the reduction time, I poured off most of the marinade after 2 hours and reduced the sauce before cooking the pork chops. I served it with a rice pilaf and steamed cabbage with a little melted butter with lemon juice.

Be careful not to overcook these lean pork chops. The first time I made this I had the pork in a beer brine for the grill, and when the weather changed my plans I found this recipe and made the marinade as a sauce on the side - it was fantastic. Next time I followed the recipe, and as other reviewers commented, it took a long time to thicken and the pork got a little tough. Now when I make the marinade I make extra to cook ahead as the sauce, and when the pork is about done I pour the already thickened sauce in the pan - think Marsala- turn to coat, and it's beautifully coated without any overcooking. I keep sake in the pantry and use it as the dry wine, and add a little Sriracha for some kick. I usually serve this with a vegetable fried brown rice and asian slaw. Even my husband, who thinks he has to have mashed potatoes with pork chops, loves this.

Awesome and easy! The marinade took a little longer to become a glaze but was worth it.

Served with baby bok choy sauteed with garlic and olive oil, BTW. It was a great side to go with this dish, and gets me out of the peas/broccoli/brussels sprouts rut.

This is a very simple, tasty recipe for pork chops. It's best if the pork chops marinate for a day at least. I added extra ginger and a bit more garlic. Also grilling the chops on the bbq was the way to go.

As some reviewers suggested, I doubled the ginger and used fresh garlic. I lightly sauteed the pork chops for 2 minutes each side, then added the marinade and a half of chopped onion and cooked it covered for 10 minutes on low. Then I removed the pork chops and cooked the sauce on high until it was reduced and syrupy. Doubling the ginger was the way to go as it had good flavor and I think it would have been bland without that. I served it with whole grain pilaf on a bed of fresh spinach and applesauce on the side.

Quick and easy weeknight meal. I'd step up the garlic and ginger, and perhaps add some sauteed onions to add a bit more flavor. Otherwise - yum!

Didn't want to open a bottle of wine for 2 tablespoons - so I, too, used the rice wine vinegar. This recipe was absolutely delicious. Hubby loved it. I stir fried onions, carrots, snow peas, bean sprouts and green onions, adding a little chicken stock and a splash of soy, salt and pepper. Veggies were great too. Served with brown rice for a lovely, quick dinner.

This recipe is a keeper! Made it for my husband a couple of weeks ago to rave reviews. Plan to make it again tonight! Perfect weeknight meal - low prep, quick cook, delicious and not hugely guilt inducing. Plan to use the marinade on all kinds of meat bc its that good!

This was tasty and easy - a good combination! We had very thick boneless chops so we browned them for 6 minutes on each side, removed from the pan and butterflied them, reduced the glaze, and then added to butterflied chops back to the reduced glaze for a few more minutes of cooking. Served with steamed rice and veggies.

We'll definitely make this one again! I didn't have dry white wine, so I used 1 tbsp dry vermouth and 1 tbsp rice vinegar. I also added vidalia onion (what I had in the house) to the marinade. My chops took longer to cook since they were thicker. I added more onion plus mushrooms to the sauce, then some cornstarch to thicken it. It didn't take very long. I served with brown rice. This was a big hit with my 18 month old! She couldn't get enough! Next time I will marinate for more than 45 minutes for extra flavor. Very tasty. A new favorite in our house.

This recipe was unbelievable! It will definitely be cooked again. Not only that but we used the left over pork for the next night and included it in an Asian stir fry... It was just as good the next day and was fabulous in the stir fry!

I didnt have any dry white wine, so I substituted a little rice wine vinegar, instead. I caremized some diced onions in the skillet directly after I removed the pork. I dont like running low on sauce so I doubled the recipe than used a little bit of corn starch to thicken it. This was soooo good. The wife loved it.

This dish was wonderful!! My boyfriend has a tendency to put a certain condiment on everything, but this dish, he ate as is. He raved about it!! Definitely a keeper. I also recommend using the low salt chicken broth and soy sauce. Also added I chose to add onions to marinade. Glaze reduction took me 10min. Enjoy!

To the cook from Dallas, pork loin chops are not sliced tenderloin, but sliced from a loin roast. The tenderloin is more tender and a darker meat.

This was a great recipe! I used honey instead of sugar. Everyone in my family loved it. I will make this again!

Made with pork tenderloins instead of boneless loin chops so I marinated for 2.5 hrs. Grilled the tenderloin instead of cooking on stove. Moist! The rice raisin herb pilaf (this site) was good side dish since it was on the sweet side. Can anyone tell me if bones pork loin chops are just tenderloins that are sliced?

How easy(!) And very flavorful with the glaze. Had to do without wine; added dash of wasabi powder, white pepper and black sesame seeds to marinade, and only had 30 min in fridge. Still, was really juicy and rich with the reduced sauce (added sprinkle of cornstarch to slightly thicken, too). Served with couscous w/ raisin, which went well with the slight sweet of the glaze. So healthy and easy easy easy, and could be fancied up for guests.

Very tasty! We added more ginger, and garlic and sliced both, instead of mincing (my mother in law's suggestion). Less burning of each if you grill the chops. Also, we used a really good Pinot Grigio white wine, instead of using a Chardonay. Marinated for 3 hours, then removed the chops and grilled. Then threw the green onion in the marinade and sauteed. Also, thought that this would be good served over white or wild rice.

Good. Nor great. I wouldn't make this for company, but it's an ok dinner for a week night in a pinch. I carmelized onions and added a little thyme. DH thought it was good. I thought it was ok. I think next time I will increase the ginger and garlic. That might give it a little more kick.

Followed the recipe exactly, I had hoped this recipe would have flavors with depth but it was boring and dull (and a little too salty.) Definitely better ways to prepare pork.

a keeper.. have tried this with both pork and boneless chicken. a simple easy everyday meal served with fried rice from this site

this is the 2nd time I've made this in the past two weeks & it keeps getting better & better. I usually prefer my meat grilled, but in this case pan fried is just as good & I was happier with the results. I used cornstarch this time to thicken the sauce & it was 10X better than the first time. four thumbs up for ease of prep to satisfaction ratio!

This was delicious, but I agree with other reviewers that the marinade takes a lot longer than one minute to cook down. I started it boiling in a separate pan while the porkchops were cooking, and this worked quite well.

My husband and I loved this dish! I served it with cous cous, sesame green beans and cucumber salad. It was a bit salty because I used regular chicken broth instead of the low salt (didn't want to make a trip to the store so I used what I had). I agree...glaze needs to cook quite a bit longer and I plan to remove all the leftover meaty bits before deglazing the pan next time. I thought it had great flavor and SO easy to make! I'll be making this one again with low salt chicken broth, add onions, extra garlic and serve with rice.

This dish was not good. The sauce was too salty and the pork chops did not really absorb the sauce even if I marinated it for three hours.

This is a tasty but simple dish. My heat must have been too high because most of my marinade evaporated before it could turn into a glaze. I added some water, and it turned out fine.

A delicious and easy recipe. I too had to cook the glaze longer. Also I would recommend using low-sodium soy sauce. I heated up some oil and cooked the onions and some garlic first. I panseared the chops in a separate pan (to avoid the straining of bits).Then when I was ready to reduce the sauce down to a glaze, I added the onions,garlic, and chops back to the mixture. I also added some rosemary for a nice subtle flavor.

Easy recipe and great low cal way to prepare pork chops. I added a little more ginger (didn't have fresh) and it was great. The sauce did take longer to reduce, but very tasty. Even my picky teenage boys liked it.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I agree with others, the glaze certainly takes longer than 1 minute...more like 10. I also added to the marinade a little Thai peanut sauce. Served this with Asian-Style Shrimp and Pineapple Fried Rice also found on this website...although I omitted the shrimp, only because I didn't have any on hand!

It definately took about 10 minutes to get the glaze for the pork. When I try this again I think I will use low salt soy sauce. As the sauce cooked it got saltier. Over all it was good just a little to salty.

Rating: 2
I added a little more soy sauce, and since I only had yellow onions instead of green, I first carmelized them in a little canola oil, then set them aside and added them with the reserved marinade to cook together to combine into a sauce. Nothing exceptional, but still a nicely flavored dish and a juicy chop. Served with white rice and a spicy carrot/cabbage slaw.

What's not to like about this? I admit I was a little sceptical about the marinade at first. I'm also not very practiced at preparing pork chops but I've recently moved in with a 'meat and potatoes' kinda fella, so I've had to broaden my repetoire. Like a previous reviewer, I'm not sure if it was the chops, the marinade or the preparation but these meat was tender and the sauce was flavourful. It's a simple, easy dish. Can't beat that.

We didn't have any ginger the first time we made this, but it was still very yummy. We used center cut pork chops (with bone), and we grilled the pork chops. Because we were grilling the chops, we made the "glaze" separately (had to add corn starch to thicken it). I don't know if it was the type of chop, the grilling, the marinating, or a combo, but they were incredibly moist and juicy. Definitely a keeper.

This was just OK. I, too, boiled the sauce for over 10 minutes and it still didn't get too "glazey". Didn't like the chunks of ginger or meat bits in the sauce. Won't bother with this one again.

This dish is nothing special. The flavors were good, but I should have listened to the other reviewers about the "glaze". I simmered the marinade about 10 minutes to condense it and the meat solids were very unappealing. If I make this this again I'll cook the marinade in a separate pan.

Very nice recipe, very flavorful as well. Made both pork chops and chicken together in the marinade, both came out wonderful! Very fast, and delicious! I added an extra tsp of garlic (by accident) but still was wonderful! Also, served with homemade fried rice, husband loved it! It's a very nice and simple change to stir fry!

Tasty, easy and appealing to the eye. I followed the recipe to the letter. I just had to be patient while reducing the marinade to get it to the right consistency since I did not want to add cornstarch as other readers had done. I served it with basmati rice. I'm sure it would be good with skinless boneless chicken breasts as well.

My family loved these, including my 4-year old who is very picky. I followed the suggestion of the other cook, who browned the chops first, then simmered them slowly (covered) for 5-10 min. I strained the sauce to get rid of the meat solids (they looked gross), then reduced it down a bit. Also added a little cornstarch/water solution to thicken a bit. I'll definitely be making this again; it was quick, easy, and good - perfect for a weeknight.

Sorry, I must be missing something, but found this recipe lacking. There are lots of great ways to prepare pork chops so I would not make this again. Sauce was thin although the pork chops were moist and tender.

Just tried this tonight and thought it was great. I followed the other cooks' suggestions -- and eliminated the oil, just used cooking spray to brown the chops a minute or two on each side. Then added the marinade and simmered gently, covered, about 15 minutes, removed the chops and reduced the glaze. I julienned one medium zucchini and two carrots, which I cooked for a minute in the microwave and touched off with a dab of sesame oil, soy sauce and cooking sherry. Yum!

Made this for dinner last night and it was wonderful. After sauteing the pork chops I cut them into slices and served them on a bed of brown rice and drizzled the glaze over, to coat both the meat and the rice. It's true that you do need to cook the sauce quite a bit longer than one minute.

Very good and easy to make. I boiled the marinade a lot longer than one minute. I wanted it to be more like a syrup(very reduced), and I thought the sauce needed to be strained to remove meat solids and "froth" that developed.

I made this for a mid-week family meal and everyone said it was delicious (including my 2 small children). I served with rice and vegetables. It's a nice weekday family meal, there are no expensive ingredients, nothing called for that I didn't already have on hand. I wouldn't serve it to company however, it's not a dish that would impress anyone.
