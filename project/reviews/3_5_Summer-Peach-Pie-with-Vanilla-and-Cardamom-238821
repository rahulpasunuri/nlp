This pie is exquisite..I read reviews and cut back on cardamom to 1/2 teas..wish I had put in more..there was a very slight scent of cardomom, but it could have been stronger..maybe I'll try it again just as the recipe calls for.

Here is what I did & my results: I cut the cardamom way down to 1/4 tsp. as was advised to do by other reviewers, and it was STILL overpowering. I used only 3 lbs. of 'peeled' peaches {its all I had on hand}. I made a one crust/open faced tart shell instead of using a pie plate & two crusts. This recipe worked great & was very pretty to look at with the peaches exposed except for the problem of too much cardamom. Next time I will cut cardamom down to only 1/8 th of a tsp. I especially love the flavor & scent of 'cardamom' & am not normally shy at all about using plenty of spices, but you have to watch out with this recipe as not to overpower the flavor of the peaches, or it can taste like you are chewing on a scented candle. I didn't rate this recipe because I did make some minor changes.

Really good, lots of fans amongst my friends. I used half as much sugar (usual for me, I think the fruit tastes great!) and half tsp of cardamom, following suggestion of others, instead of full tsp (epicurious cooks are so great!). I think one could do a bit more than 1/2 tsp, but 1 tsp is likely too much, even as a cardamom lover; half is subtle and interesting. The vanilla bean is delightful. Don't scrimp on flour or another absorber of moisture or it'll be kinda damp. I skipped the butter in the filling; ya don't miss it with nice ripe peaches. I used "white" whole wheat (a milder variety of whole wheat from King Arthur) for the crust with all butter. I liked the rustic, country feel of the crust; as did I. I also like the peach skins on with the towel rubbing as recommended.

Quite good! I love cardamom, and loved it in a peach pie, but found it a little overpowering here. I had read other reviews and reduced the amount slightly but will reduce it further next summer. Oh, and I peeled all the peaches (boo).

this is a great pie recipe! the best one i've tried for peach pie. My only alteration for next time would be that instead of trying to use all of the pie dough, i would trim the excess! I kept it all and made a thick pie crust which ended up baking quite hard. other than that, this is a wonderful dessert.

I have a huge peach tree, and have tried probably a dozen different peach pie recipes over the years. This one is my FAVORITE! Surprisingly, the cardamom goes perfectly with the peaches and gives it a very unique, slightly exotic flavor. The vanilla bean makes a huge difference - way better than using vanilla extract. I also used the pie crust recipe linked in this one, and it's by far the best pie crust ever. DON'T use store-bought crusts - because this is such a juicy pie, it will be soggy on the bottom. The homemade crust turns out flaky and crispy, and has a great buttery flavor. I've made this pie three times, and here are my suggested changes: 1) Use only 3/4 tsp cardamom, or even slightly less. A full tsp is just too overpowering. 2) increase the flour by 1/2 to 1 tbsp (depending on how ripe the peaches are), so it's not quite so runny (although a good peach pie SHOULD be very juicy!). 3) Make a lattice with the top crust, so the peaches can bubble without the liquid running out all over the top crust and ruining it. I also brushed beaten egg on the top crust instead of cream, which gives it a shinier glazed look.

Really liked this recipe. I cut the cardamom to a heaping half teaspoon, similar to others' recommendation. The aroma of the spice created an interesting combination with the peach flavor - something I wouldn't have thought of. Friends couldn't guess the spice, but complimented on it. The vanilla bean is essential, don't skip it. I peeled the peaches because I don't like the skins in pies, it creates an unpleasant texture IMO.

The cardamom was very notable in this recipe. I would scale it back to 1/2 teaspoon. The vanilla was a nice touch. The peaches were overcooked but the crust was flaky and delicious. Baking time could be reduced by about 15 minutes to improve the texture. My husband encouraged a 4-fork rating, but I didn't think the recipe was exceptional.

Good flavor. I substitute a beaten egg for the whipping cream.

Wow, I have never picked a dud recipe from Epicurious, but this one missed the mark. The combination of peach and cardamom is pretty odd, and the recipe calls for way too much cardamom, should be just a pinch. Disappointed, will try again, bumping up the vanilla, and leaving out the ...

This is simply the best peach pie recipe!! Will definitely make again! Vanilla bean adds so much

Love this recipe! I cheated and used store bought pie crusts instead of making them from scratch and it still turned out great. The vanilla sugar and the cardamom is what makes this recipe taste so delicious.

The best part about this is not having to peel the peaches! Made my own crust and used homemade vanilla instead of vanilla bean. Yum!

Really loved this pie! The only reason I gave it 3 forks instead of 4 was because the second day the cardamon got to be way too strong. But if you eat it the day you make it, this is great. The crust turned out great, and following others' suggestions, I peeled the peaches.

Wasn't great. My pie crust turned out horrible and the peaches were mediocore. I didn'tlike the peaches with the skin on them, it was kind of chewy yet the peaches were mushy--not great. I would not make this again, nor would i make the crust. Maybe i over processed it, but it completely fell apart once i tried to start rolling.

Fantastic pie! Made a lattice top and covered the pie with foil after about 15 minutes in the oven. Kept the rest the same. Delicious!

I would not make this pie again. It came out extremely runny, and the taste was very bland.

I substituted vanilla extract for vanilla bean- I used a half tsp, but it could have used more. I also substituted fresh ground cardamom for store-bought, and I used only about a half tsp, and that was plenty. Next time I'll drop a spot of light rum into the peach mixture too--I think it will be a nice touch. Great summer dessert!

I made this pie and it came out tasty. The problem was that it also came out very juicy. I had to pour over a cup of juice out of the pie when I first cut into it. If I ever make it again, I would use some cornstarch to help gel the peach juice and maybe make it with a lattice crust.

The cardamom gave this pie a very appealing and slightly exotic flavor. The top crust was perfect as well, sweet and crispy. We loved this pie, and it tasted even better after a few days in the refrigerator!

I followed this recipe exactly ~ the cardamom and vanilla combination is unexpected and delicious. However, I regret leaving the skin on the peaches - they're too tough and distracting, even having removed the fuzz with a kitchen towel. Also, my pie was slightly runny; next time I'll increase the flour to at least 4 T.

EASIEST recipe ever - quick and wonderful. Leaving the skins on the peaches creates a terrifically intense flavor - I will never use canned fillings again! I used regular liquid vanilla instead of the bean; cinnamon and nutmeg instead of the cardamon. Still was fabulous. Simply fabulous.
