This is a good basic mini pizza recipe. I don't think I rolled my dough thinly enough, and will give the recipe another chance. I also ended up adding a little more water than called for (about another 1/4 cup) Did not add the additional 1/4 cup of flour

This is really a no-brainer, but for an even more kid friendly dish, use lightly toasted English Muffins and broil instead of baking.
