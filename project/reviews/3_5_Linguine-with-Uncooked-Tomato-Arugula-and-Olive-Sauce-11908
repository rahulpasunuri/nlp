My husband and I loved this recipe. The only changes I made were to add some toasted pine nuts and feta at the end and use penne instead of linguine. Will definitely make again and will make those same changes. Delicious and simple.

Very quick and simple, with things I had on hand. As others suggested, I substituted capers for olives and crumbled some goat cheese on top. Next time I might use a shorter pasta, and warm the sauce a bit with the pasta.

Great dressing for a warm pasta salad. I substituted capers for the olives and it works fine. It would be great for a summer lunch...very italian tasting!

This was just okay. I find it fresh, but too bland even with addition of Parmesan cheese.

Maybe I was just hungry, but this was one of the best things I have eaten in a long time. I added the goat cheese, as per the suggestions, and it was really wonderful. A rare 4 fork!!

This was our Summer of 2000 favourite recipe. It's so quick, fresh and delicious. I use more olives than called for. Crumbled blue cheese or chevre are tasty additions.

Delicious, simple dish. Arugula is a nice change from the classic basil.

This recipe is easy to make and uses the bounty of my summer garden. I used a combination of Nyon & Nicoise olives and the meal turned out fine.

I made this dish twice in about two weeks. I cheated a bit by simmering the garlic in the olive oil and briefly heating the sauce. (I also added some lumps of goat-milk cream cheese; it worked well with the dish.)

Very good and really simple. I used vine-ripened tomatoes instead of plum and it was fine. I would stick to Kalamata olives, no substitutes. I plan to use this often during the summer when plum tomatoes and arugula is best.
