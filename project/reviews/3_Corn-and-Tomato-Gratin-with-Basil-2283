Inspired by the chef from Rhode Island I made my own version: lacking basil, I went with a Mexican version, using cilantro, a jalapeno pepper, some red onion and cheddar cheese. I never have cream around, so I used skim milk (less than called for)and it worked fine. It would have been even better with sour cream. Like Woonsocket, I mixed everything together, just saving some cheese for the top. It was great. You know, I could have just used pico de gallo salsa for most of the seasoning and it would have been really fast.

Overall this needs more flavor, One change I would make is to add the tomatoes (and more of them) to the corn/custard before baking. The way this is, the tomatoes seem like more of a garnish.

Okay, with what I am about to say here, you could say that I am in fact re-writing the recipe, but I made some changes that made this recipe a smash! Here are my changes/ additions -- they gave the recipe a lot more flavor! To the onions I added 2 cloves of garlic -- I used 3 ears of corn instead of 7 and instead substituted a 10oz box of frozen chopped spinach -- Instead of half-and-half I used (2) 12oz cans of evaporated skim milk -- Instead of 3 whole eggs I used 4 -- In addition to 1/4 teaspoon of hot sauce I used 2 teaspoons of Emeril's essence -- I mixed the tomatoes and basil in with the corn mixture when it cooled and added the following: 1/2 cup grated romano cheese, 1/2cup crumbled blue cheese, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. Everything else I followed and baked the whole thing for a total of 45min. Excellent with a glass of crisp white wine and crusty bread and a salad on a summer night!

This is just okay, considering the amount of work that goes into it. There are far better (and more impressive) recipes out there that take half the time.

This was pretty good, but not great. With so many delicious ways to prepare corn out there, I probably won't make this again.

Great side dish..everyone loved it. I reduced the amt of half and half to around two cups. Also, it takes longer than 30 min to bake...closer to 45 minutes unless you like it kind of runny. This is a great fresh corn dish!

I've made this a few times for large family picnics and bbq's with highly favorable responses, even from the finicky kids. It's nice to make the corn the day before and just reheat and add the tomatoes the day of the party to reduce last minute workload.
