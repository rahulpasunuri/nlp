I have made this many times for cocktail parties. It never fails to please. I'll be doing it again this year. Seems hard to believe it has been around since 1996.

We loved the flavor of the glaze. Like other reviewers I used all the ingredients but not the measurements. And I used only a tablespoon of Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil.

I made this for an quick weeknight dinner (scaled way down, of course) and it went really well with herbed jasmine rice and a nice glass of rose. Will definitely make again.

Cut the oil way down to 1/4 cup and used olive oil. Tasted great with swordfish steaks. Delicious with chilled chardonnay.

This is not a good glaze or sauce. It is far too harsh. If you want to disguise the taste of salmon, it is fine. If you want to enhance the taste of salmon, it is terrible. It doesn't deserve to be on this site. 2 cups of oil? Are you kidding me? Salmon, especially Chinook, is full of natural fish oil. Why add tasteless vegetable oil? This is JUST NOT GOOD! Sorry but from someone who gets fresh delicious salmon from the Willamette & Columbia Rivers each year, I speak with distain for this recipe!!!

cut recipe in half except dill (used 1/4 C) and oil (used 3/4C). soy allergy in the house so I substituted mollases/balsamic/fish sauce - worked well. reduced glaze a bit to thicken. cooked on cedar plank on a charcoal grill - outstanding

I cut the recipe in half but made it exactly as written; I personally found the mustard/dill sauce to be overwhelmingly "mustardy" and could not taste the dill at all. The glazed salmon without the sauce tasted pretty good; my family seemed to enjoy it; even had second helpings. My broiler is a bit of a problem; I have two choices: 3 inches or 5 inches from the broiler; 3 inches was just a bit too close and after about 4 minutes it was clear that I needed to lower the rack or have charred salmon for dinner. I would consider trying the glaze and roasting the salmon at about 400 degrees, but I won't be making the sauce again. Next time I will try the 1994 version of mustard dill sauce that adds some cream, perhaps this tempers the very intense mustard taste of the sauce?

I made this last night for dinner, accompanied with parmesan mashed red potatoes and grilled Hungarian squash. White burgundy goes well with the salmon. Everyone loved it, and it got rave reviews. I am rating this three forks instead of four because I made a few changes that I think really improved the dish. The one major change I made was to cook the sauce - I carmelized it in order to bring out the flavors of the dijon and brown sugar before adding the dill at the last minute. Before I did this, I didn't really like the flavor of the sauce (uncooked) - it was rather acidic and had a weird aftertaste (vinegar?). Also, there is no need to use 2 cups of oil in this. I would reccommend using one cup or less.

All I can say is "WOW!" Simple, delicious, and fast. My wife and I have decided that we'll make this a lot. The sauce is versatile, too. We drizzled it on the asparagus we made to accompany the salmon. I only used 1/3 of the ingredients for 1 lb. of salmon and it came out great-- plenty of glaze, plenty of sauce, plus a little left over for drizzling on other things as we experiment (maybe on an omelet?). I used olive oil, and I'm a little sorry I did. It was too strong a flavor. Maybe next time I'll use half olive oil and half vegetable. I also used tarragon white wine vinegar. That worked well.

I'm trying this tonight. Scaled the recipe for 1lbs salmon: 2 tablespoons + 1/2 teaspoon wine vineger (2/3 cup) 3 tablespoons + 1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard (1 cup) 1 tablespoon + 1 3/4 teaspoons Light brown sugar (1/2 cup) 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons + 1 1/4 teaspoons vegetable oil (2 cup) 1 3/4 teaspoons soy sauce (3 tablespoons) 2 1/2 teaspoons dill (1/4 cup) 1 pound salmon (5 pound)

Great recipe. Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it. The salmon was tender and delicious--the sauce so tangy. I made it 2 weeks ago and I will make it again tonight!

I've revised this a bit to make it less fattening - equal amounts dijon and maple syrup, half that amount of balsamic or other vinegar, plus dill. NO OIL except for spray on the pan. Amazingly tasty and delicious and tons less calories.

Very easy recipe that my family (2 young kids) loved. I only used 1 C oil, then cut the entire sauce batch to 1/4. Very, very good. Would definitely make again, and would make for guests. Also, its very quick. I made potatoes, green beans, and the salmon in about 30 minutes.

This recipe is very easy and quick to make. I did not have white-wine vinegar, so I substituted it with apple cider vinegar, and it was fine. Also, I took one reviewer's suggestion, and used half the oil. One cup is more than enough. Enjoy!

I was going to use Sam's fresh Copper River Salmon, but they were no longer selling it. I bought individually-wrapped, frozen, skinless filets from Sam's instead. I quickly thawed them in a water bath and broiled them the day before, refrigerated, then warmed in a low oven before serving. I was serving 50, so I tripled the meat and doubled the sauce. It was outstanding.

Super recipe!! Very easy, fast and delicious! I brushed the soy sauce directly onto the salmon and then brushed the glaze on. Everybody loved it from age 4 to grandma and grandpa.

This recipe was great! So easy and uncomplicated. I left out the dill (not crazy about dill and soy)and reduced it to 1/4 of the original recipe since I was only cooking for 2 people. I also marinated the salmon in low sodium soy sauce for about an hour and it came out so full of flavor, I can't wait to make it again. My dinner date loved it so much he asked for the recipe! This one is a winner in my book!

Rating: 3
Very good! A success at our dinner party. We sprinkled individual-portion-sized salmon fillets with low-sodium soy sauce an hour before baking at 375 for 18 minutes (didn't want to risk a smoke-filled kitchen!). Otherwise, we followed recipe exactly. Perfect texture. I thought the sauce was slightly too sweet, but noone else agreed with me. Maybe next time I'll lower the b. sugar a smidge.

Wow! I'm not a big salmon lover, but this dish was fantastic, and so easy to prepare. I didn't have white vinegar, so substituted white wine with a little lemon juice. Also, followed another reviewers suggestion to marinate the salmon in soy sauce. The result was the most flavorful salmon I've ever tasted! I'll try for a dinner party, as the prep time was so fast. A great find!

I sort of kind of liked this dish. The sauce was good next to the fish, however the salmon tasted plain, the flavor did not penetrate the fish at all. Not bad, not great.

Rating: 4
This was amazing! I am not a fish lover, but my husband made a request for salmon for having our friends over to dinner, so I made this recipe. It was amazing - so amazing we are having it tomorrow again. It was so quick to prepare. I halved the oil too (used olive oil), and I also marinaded the defrosting fillets in some soy sauce, and it was just fantastic. I probably used a little more dill than called for, and I heated the sauce till warm over the stove. I cooked my fish at 350 degrees for 30 minutes because I like the way it cooks better that way. This is my new favorite way to prepare salmon. Our guests loved it so much they asked for the recipe (and one of them doesn't like fish much either!).

The best salmon recipe I've ever tasted! I modified it by grilling over charcoal at 350°, and it was great. I didn't use 20% of the sauce, however.

We served this for my sister's garden wedding and it was a hit. In fact, the caterer plans to make it a permanent addition to their menu. During the summer months, we prefer to grill the salmon rather than broil it.

I made this dish for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and it was a hit!!! Garlic mashed potatoes were a great side dish, along with a steamed vegetable. I would recommend this recipe to any salmon lover, and I will definately make it again!

This is an easy and delicious way to prepare salmon. It's great for a dinner party since it requires less than 10 minutes to cook and the results are always terrific. Everyone loves the sauce and it is equally good hot or at room temperature. I usually cut the amount of oil in half and it works fine.

Rating: 2
not our favorite... i think it was the sugar that was too much, it was so very sweet. that's a matter of taste, i guess, and i generally am not a fan of really sweet things before dessert... i skipped the oil altogether- doesn't belong in a glaze-- and didn't miss it.

Lovely simple quick delicious dish. I made a quarter of the sauce recipe for two people and it was perfect. Aside from that, I wouldn't change a thing.

This is by far one of my favorite salmon recipes. Usually when we have salmon out, we agree we like this better. I make it all the time and use this as a regular for company. I make it so much I know what to buy in the grocery without looking at the recipe. I do cut the sauce in half. Love this recipe.

Very delicious and easy to make. The recipe makes waaaaaaaaaay too much sauce. I'd cut the sauce recipe (and glaze recipe) in half and add less oil. Adjust amount of brown sugar and dill to taste.

We loved this. I served it with whole salmon which I spread the glaze inside, wrapped in foil and baked. I did cut the oil in half. I served with sauce which I was at first worried about the tartness, but when served on the salmon was incredible. Even the non-salmon eaters enjoyed this one.

Far too much oil for my taste. Glad everyone else had good luck with it.

Sooooo easy! Even though I cut the sauce in half and passed at the table, I had extra. It was so tasty I saved the remainder of the sauce and prepared the salmon again four days later. This one is going into the rotation for sure! Any one have any thoughts on how long the sauce would keep in the fridge?

Rating: 4
Excellent, beautiful and easy. The sauce is delicious, and makes fish appealing to non-fish eaters. Perfect for a buffet or large party. I agree--you get a lot of sauce, but my guests were pouring it with gusto on the fish, so I'm glad I had a lot.

Very easy and flavorful (although a bit too sweet for my taste). But I will not make it under the broiler again because it smoked so much it set off our alarm repeatedly! (Which never happened before, and I cook a lot!)

OK this is a WONDERFUL sauce for salmon. DELICIOUS. BUT WARNING!! You must cut the recipe in HALF! I didn't listen to everyone else on the board and I made the full recipe and it easily could've covered 18 fish! I froze it so we'll see how that turns out next time when I make salmon again!

Rating: 4
Exellent recipe. The only problem we ran into was the fact that we prepared six pounds of salmon, so we doubled all the ingredients in the sauce except the oil. Lots of left over sauce. Next time we will only make one recipe of the glaze. Would a glaze such as this one freeze?

I prepared this dish for my mother and her husband not long ago. From their reactions, I was sorry I hadn't stayed to eat with them. This recipe is definitely a keeper, as it has wonderfully bold flavors that do not mask the taste of fresh salmon, but rather enhance it. The bonus is that it takes literally only minutes to prepare. Further, it is on par with entrees served in the best dining rooms in the world, as a similar dish is served in a fine dining establishment in Vancouver.

I gave this 4 forks because not only did it have fantastic flavor it was so simple and quick to prepare. I was cooking for 2 and reduced the sauce to 1/3 which was still way more than I needed - $$ were minimal! A cooks tip: I bought a 2 pound salmon fillet from Costco, cooked 1/2 about a week ago using another recipe, then I froze the rest. I used the frozen piece for this recipe and you would never have known that it wasn't fresh. I'd never done this before but now it's tried and proven. I served this recipe with a sauteed spinach recipe from BA 7/2002 and a gratin potato.

I am not a fan of fish, but this was wonderful. I divided the recipe in half, but there was still way too much sauce. I'm considering going back to the store for more salmon! Oh, do be careful with greasing the pan. I had a couple of grease fires! The salmon was unaffected, thankfully.

Rating: 3
3.5 forks, excellent! And beautiful as well, with the yellow sauce with bright green specks poured over the slightly browned salmon fillet. I omitted all the oil (I always omit oil from dressings) and didn't miss it. Next time, I will apportion the mixture to make less glaze and more sauce. My salmon also took longer than 8 mins to cook through.

Grilled the salmon about 8 minutes, and cut the sauce with some white wine. I served it with the Gingered Vegetable Stir-Fry. Quick and delicious!

On first glance, this dish seemed very good but looked far too fatty. So I made a few modifications. Substituted dry white wine for half of the oil, and it still seemed a bit heavy. Also sprinkled a little bit of cayenne pepper and lemon juice directly to the steaks before glazing and grilling to help cut the heaviness and add a tiny bit of kick. It was yummy. Next time, I might cut back the oil and even the vinegar a little more.

Served this to 60 Graphic Desinger. Love the option to serve at room temp. Made the day before, dressed with dill running over the platters ,cherry tomatoes and lemon. Looked very impressive! If you are not a salmon lover or on the fence give it a try, hey you just might like it!

Very good. I made this for my husband & I last week (our 5 yr old doesn't eat salmon) ! So, needless to say, I had to 3/4 the recipe - turned out GREAT!!! Even using less salmon (12 oz of fresh Atlantic Salmon)... turned out just fine. Had plenty of sauce.. ended up tossing the extra sauce with some fresh greens !

Wow! this is so incredibly easy and DELICIOUS. We grilled salmon steaks and also marinated them in the sauce for 10 minutes. I also reduced the sauce by at least half and had plenty. I didn't have all the ingredients as well. Had to use rice wine vinegar and apple cidar vinegar and used dry dill instead of fresh. Don't think you can go wrong improvising with this one. IT'S A WINNER.YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!!!! I GUARANTEE.

I made this dish last night for my fiancee, who is very particular about how fish is prepared. He loved it, and it took almost no effort to make. It is easily reduced down for smaller portions, and I probably spent 15 minutes in the kitchen. This is definitely a quick recipe for when you want to impress!

This recipe was fantastic! We enjoyed both of the sauces--particularly, the mustard dill one. The recipe does make a lot of the sauce so you may want to halve or quarter the amounts or, heck, put it in a glass and serve it with the meal!! A definite make-again.
