Used petite diced w/roasted garlic, but still added the garlic. I may have went heavy on the red pepper flakes, but this was outstanding. Seemed like a lot of basil but wasnt too much.

Used this recipe as an implement of seduction...it worked! I use one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos (think Rotel) and one 14.5 oz can of regular petite diced tomatoes instead of the one large can of diced tomatoes. The Lady loves it; it's become a staple 'round here...

To add a little Italian authenticity: slice your favorite spicy Italian sausage, saute and add to sauce immediately before serving. Definitely a weekly favorite.

YES! Double the garlic and double the pepper flakes! Depending on your burner, you will probably need more than 8 minutes to thicken the sauce. More like 10 or 12. You want it almost like mud; some of the tomato should start to carmelize just a bit, and that makes it perfect.

This is very good and quick to put together. For some reason, though, the basil likes to clump with the cheese, so I serve the cheese on the side. Easy dinner when I'm feeling lazy!

My husband and I love this recipe - it's quick and I always have the ingredients! WAY better than jarred pasta sauce.

This is a delicious quick main dish. I have made it with and without the wine, and I always add a little more garlic and red pepper flakes. You could easily use half the cheese without missing it. One other note, the sauce has to simmer for quite a while to thicken properly - but it's worth every minute of the rate! Yummy!

This recipe needed to be tweaked a bit. I added two more cloves of garlic and another 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes for some heat. Results were good overall.

it's just okay. the kind of thing you make when you have nothing left in the house to eat. don't think i'll make it again, too bland and boring. even the red pepper didn't help!

Too easy! Satisfying my need to make dinner into a project, I combined this with the recipe for "chicken marinara" (Bon Appetit, Dec. 2003). Basically that chicken with this sauce and pasta, and more tomatoes. Came out great! I'll probably double the red pepper flakes next time.

I love quick and tasty dishes -- made after work in ~15-20 minutes. Given reports of mildness I made the following modifications with success: 3 large garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and I used 2 cans of Muir Glenn diced tomatoes with garlic and basil that I pulsed a couple times in the food processor. Delish.

The recipe was good, but I didn't think it was any better than throwing together some Barilla or Five Brothers pasta sauce, some red pepper, pasta, and cheese. We added Perdue Shortcuts Chicken to add some protein to the meal.

So simple and so good! I agree that the recipe as written isn't all that spicy, so I too added more crushed pepper flakes. I also only added about 1/2 cup cheese. Yummy!

This is so quick and easy that I make it all the time. I add more red pepper because I like it spicy and serve extra sauce on the side with garlic bread. Good leftover too!

Three garlic cloves and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes spiced it up sufficiently.

Simple and yummy! I make it all the time, as I usually have all the ingredients in my house. Adjust crushed red pepper up or down based on your preferred level of spiciness.

I made this dish for a dinner w/ friends and everyone loved it! I added extra crushed red pepper to kick up the sauce and it was delicious.

We love this recipe. Since it freezes so well, I divide it into individual plastic containers for lunches. Also, for added protein, I have added a combination of sweet and spicy Italian sausage. That also adds a bit of a needed kick.

very quick and good for a weekday meal. Nothing extraordinary but quick and tasty. It wasnt particularly spicy so i think next time i would increase the crushed red pepper. served with salad - a nice light meal that comes together quickly.

I make this almost weekly. Quick and tasty.

Quick and easy, although I thought arrabbiata sauce was supposed to be rather spicy, this sauce wasn't.
