This was really great! I loved it, and so did my husband and children. I was afraid that it would be to rich, and it was definiately not to rich. For me and my husband I filled it vanilla fudge ice cream and they were G-R-E-A-T!

Loved it! Am definitely going to make it again. Loved the ice cream flavors and the combination with the meringues. I used almonds instead of pistachios and ground them in the food processor (still chunky). I made the meringue cookies and got 19 instead of 24. Used an ice cream scooper to measure out the meringue and flattened with an offset spatula.
