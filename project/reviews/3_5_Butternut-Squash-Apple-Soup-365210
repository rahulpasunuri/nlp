The title could explain the taste better. I found the onion a bit strong, and the butternut was covered up by the other flavors. But if you're looking for a balanced "Potato, bacon and Butternut" pureed soup; this was nice.

I fixed this soup for a soup and salad dinner for friends, and it made a hearty meal. My two friends and husband all enjoyed it. I increased the amount of carrot and skipped the celery because my husband doesn't like it. I also took aother reviewer's advice and roasted the squash whole at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes. This made it very easy to remove the peel and cut up; I then added the squash to the soup when the other vegetables were done. This is an interesting recipe that seems creamy but healthy.

I love the ingredients in this recipe! I used sweet potatoes instead of white and added some Hungarian paprika. Next time I'll also add a touch of garlic. Bacon rounds out the flavors wonderfully!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, and it was wonderful! It was quite filling for a relatively healthy soup and reheated well for lunch the next day. For anyone who is interested, the only changes I made were to use apples from my farmer's market (Arkansas black) and applewood smoked bacon.

I made this exactly as written (well, I used turkey bacon instead of pork). I found it to be a little too tart. I tasted the apple more than the squash. If I were to make it again, I would use half (or none?) of the apple and add more butternut squash and/or carrot. I bet I could just find a better recipe though...

Have been experimenting with various Squash recipes. Recently tried the new one from Cooks Illustrated...usually you can count it will be the best, but while they said the flavor with be a strong squash flavor...it was not there at all. Discovered this recipe...followed the instructions with the exception of adding Honey to the vegetables when first put into the pot. Great flavor. Try it! You'll like it!

I made a double recipe for this and split it with my daughter's family. When my 5- year-old grandson raved about it, it gets my 4 forks. I ran a recipe analysis on it via the Calorie Count website, it got an "A" for nutrition. Though I love the flavor of bacon, I used a high grade olive oil that was infused with garlic instead. I also added a grating of nutmeg and a little extra salt for an individual serving. I used Greek yogurt, ham pieces and apple for a topping. This will definitely become a part of my repertoire.

Excellent soup although I will omit bacon next time. I

This soup is wonderful. I subbed half the water for apple cider and added a bit of cardamom & nutmeg. The bacon added a great contrast to the sweetness.

Everyone loved this soup! I used vegetable oil instead of bacon, and didn't add any garnishes. The 1/2 tsp pepper gave it a good kick - I would use less next time, and will use either white pepper or cayenne to avoid black specks. It took about 40 minutes to cook everything down before it was pureed.

Great recipe! I increase the apple flavor by deglazing with some apple cider. Don't forget - you can use an immersion blender instead of a regular blender. I think they are easier to clean (dishwasher safe!).
