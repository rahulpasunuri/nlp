The first time I made this, I followed the recipe, and it was a big hit with my family. I have also tried variations, also well-received by my family. The favorite, by far, has been where I substituted cilantro for the basil and added some finely chopped jalapeno and jack cheese to the "stuffing." Yummy was what my son called it. Another true success was after I fried the breasts, I moved them to my smoker and finshed them off that way.

I used store bought tenderloins to cut down on prep time. I also added garlic and some parmesan to the filling for some extra flavor. It added a nice touch. I've made this twice now, and I would recemmend really cooking the bacon in the skillet before baking. I didn't the second time which added about 15 minutes to the baking time. In all, my potatos stole the show at my particular dinner party, while I was hoping this dish would.

I stuffed the chicken with a roasted anaheim chile and monterey jack cheese. I served it with "potato green chile gratin" from this site, which I added a little jack cheese to as well. With zucchini ribbons, this whole meal came out wonderful!

I was presented with several fesh pheasants by my boss. Never having cooked P. before I was worried about drying it out. I thought of this recipe. I took the dark meat off the bone substituted it for the tender and wrappedthe basil around it and then the white around that. It was amazing. He loved it and couldnt believe that I just "pulled it off without a thought." Ya gotta love that!.

I loved this recipe! I made it for my inlaws and they were impressed. I found that the bacon stayed wrapped around the chicken better if you start wrapping at the tip of the breast. I also made a recipe of the "Low Fat White Sauce" from this site and added basil, bacon bits, and garlic to it. It was wonderful!

A keeper - my picky gourmet husband liked this. Not quite 4 forks, more like 3 1/2. I did two versions: Kids - only bacon wrapped around the breast, pounded it first to flatten, Adult - Sliced a breast so that it opened up like a book, pounded it to flatten, placed basil leaves on one side, then a lot of goat cheese, closed it up and wrapped with 3-4 pcs of bacon. Used toothpicks to keep together. Sauted in pan for a few minutes each of 4 sides to partially crisp bacon. Oven for 10-15 mins.

This was WONDERFUL! I used just the chicken breasts and I took the advice of some of the chefs on here and added some feta to the chicken! It was a huge hit. One suggestion though. Use lower Sodium bacon, it cuts down on the overall saltiness, which can take away from the flavor.

We are always asked for the recipe when we serve this to guests. We've changed it a bit, substituting hot pancetta for the bacon and including goat cheese in the stuffing. As well, after baking, we remove the chicken & keep warm, then deglaze the pan with white wine, cooking until liquid almost evaporated; add a little butter & sauté a large minced shallot until softened; add a half cup of chicken stock & reduce to sauce consistency & spoon over sliced chicken.

A favorite. I substituted thinly sliced hot pancetta for the bacon and goat cheese for the chicken 'tenders', dialed back the pepper a little, deglazed pan at end with white wine, sauteed chopped scallion, & reduced chicken stock in same pan for a sauce.

This dish is great!! It's so easy too! I ( very beginner chef) can do a very good job. It's nice a juicy because of the bacon and Mmmmm I want more!

Excellent dish! I just used boneless skinless chicken breast and stuffed the basil in them. Also stuffed them with parmesan cheese. Then made a roasted garlic cream sauce to put on top.

It is a cold December night and we loved this. It brought summer to us. Blanching the basil kept it green and with full flavor. I blanch vegetables all the time, never occurred to me to blanch basil! One thing I did add was a parmesan cheese, sauteed garlic mixture that I put over the chicken after the oven bake, stuck it under the broiler for 90 seconds. It really brought out the other tastes.

I made this for a group of friends and it was super easy and I am now know as the "domestic goddess" of the group. I was sooo good. I also added the goat cheese as suggested by the another cook. The boys played paper, rock, scissors to see who got to take the leftovers home. I will definately be asked to make this again.

I had a few friends over for dinner tonight and this dish was a hit! I added the goat cheese as suggested as well as a few cloves of garlic...delicious! I don't normally like poultry, but the bacon made the chicken breast very juicy. I served it with stir-fried brocolli and leftover potatoes anna (from thanksgiving). I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe without the tenders and it turned out well--even though I was skeptical. It was very tasty, although I would brown the breasts a little longer than the 2 min. per side because I like my bacon on the crispy side. Minimal cleanup due to only 1 pan. Definitely added to my regular rotation.

an instant favorite! i took the advice of other reviewers and added goat cheese-- made the dish! blanching the basil leaves keeps the chicken breasts juicy. definite keeper.

I stuffed the breast with goatcheese as well as the tenders wrapped in basil. My family loved it, especially by 14 year old son. When I asked what we should have dinner he keeps suggesting this recipe.

This was so delicious! I made it for an impromptu dinner party with friends and it was a hit! Would definitely make this again. I used chicken tenders though which speeded up the cooking time and made for smaller portions.

Goat cheese was a good addition. Great recipe!

This recipe is fabulous!! I was concerned about the whole thing falling apart during cooking, but as long as you overlap the bacon all around the chicken, it holds together beautifully. It definitely takes longer than 4 minutes to get the bacon golden on all sides, and I baked it for 20 min instead of 15. I also added a little chopped mushroom and a little goat cheese surrounding the basil-wrapped tenders, but didn't notice them under the flavor from the bacon and basil. I plan to serve these for my next dinner party.

WOW! Recipe so simple yet so full of flavor! I have to admit I didn't have fresh basil so I had to improvise a little. I sprinkled the chicken with Italian seasoning and salt and pepper. I then topped it with some Rondelle Herb Cheese Spread. Then I wrapped it with the bacon and followed the rest of the recipe regarding the cooking directions. Absolutely FABULOUS! Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe. The bacon and basil flavors came through wonderfully. Not difficult at all to make and cooks well --although you may want to increase the cook time in the pan and in the oven a shade.

I've made this multiple times - really wonderful, easy and classy at the same time!

This dish was simple to prepare, beautifully presented and absolutely fork tender and delicious! I did change the recipe to include prosciutto ham and mozzarella cheese which I wrapped around the basil-wrapped tenders before stuffing inside the breast. The bacon wrapping and cooking was a breeze and the breasts were juicy, tender, and tasty! We also enjoyed tasty sandwiches the day after!! Do yourself a favor and make this one for your family!!!!

wonderful. I love bacon and basil, this has both...make a double batch. It's great the next day sliced to make sandwiches!

I thought that this dish was just ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular either. I had problems keeping the bacon wrapped around the chicken and the outside of the bacon got done, but the inside was very underdone. I stuffed the chicken with the basil, wrapped around the tenders and with goat cheese. The goat cheese was great, but the basil flavor did not come through. Maybe it's me, but this recipe just didn't do it for our family!

Very tasty, but the basil flavor didn't come through quite assertively enough. I'll increase the amount of basil next time around.

GREAT RECIPE. do make the simple brown sauce mentioned below to serve with it. i added goat cheese and some garlic butter to the stufffing. worked out very well. with all these changes, it's a whole new recipe, but DELICIOUS. i served it with fresh green beans, and a simple pasta and of course - a cold california chardonay.

This recipe would be great for company and is easy to prepare. I slit the chicken breast and lightly stuffed with the basil. Next time I plan to add cheese in addition. It's a definete keeper in our house.

I only had small chicken breasts, so I pounded them to a 1/4 inch thickness. I put a layer of the basil leaves and sliced mozzarella on the inside. I rolled the breasts and covered in bacon. (I also cooked them in my toaster-oven at 400 for 30 minutes, after browning). Fantastic-and surprisingly not too greasy. Slicing made a pretty presentation.

For those of you who are tired of "lite" chicken dishes, this is the one. The bacon gives it a wonderful flavor, and yes, go ahead and add some cheese.

One of the easiest dishes I have ever prepared. I do recommend a light sauce (see other reviews), however the chicken was moist and tasty on its' own as well. Pretty too!

Holy cow, this was good. The family loved it too. Next time I might try a little cheese, maybe goat cheese, stuffed in with the basil. Try this one, you will love it. The breast was very moist and tasty.

This dish was amazing. I didn't have a skillet that I could transfer into the oven so I used a Pyrex pie pan that I had let sit in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes. It helped to keep the breasts from adjusting to critical temperature. I think that you could slice these crosswise into 1/4-inch thick sections, half them, insert toothpicks and serve them cold as appetizers. This was easy and looked like half a day's work. My griddle pan came in very handy for easy transfers.

This is now one of my favorite recipes. I have made it many times. I like to nuke the bacon for 20-30 seconds first, make sure you don't do it too long, but can still wrap it easily. Just my preference. Cuts down on the crisping time in the pan which took me much longer than 4 minutes. Once the bacon is done, I like to discard the bacon fat and deglaze the pan with about a 1/4 cup white wine scraping up the browned bits. Reduce by half, add some chicken stock, bring to a boil and add a mixture of flour and water and simmer. It makes a great sauce to serve with the chicken.

Very simple and easy dish to prepare. Make sure all parts of exposed bacon are browned before baking in oven, otherwise it turns out a little soggy.

I ahve prepared this often and spread some mustard to the chicken and some grated or shredded mozzarella before putting the basil wrapped tenders in. I have also served it cold and it is tasty>

I found that you have to initially pan fry the chicken rolls about 6 minutes minimum to get rid of a lot of excess fat from the bacon and only need 10 more minutes in the oven to cook. My guests enjoyed!

Great dish to serve company. Impressive... looks like you spent hours preparing. Surprised how the bacon forms and holds the breast when cooked. I poured off some of the bacon drippings, and sauted fresh green bean and chopped onion in the same pan, as the chicken baked in the oven.
