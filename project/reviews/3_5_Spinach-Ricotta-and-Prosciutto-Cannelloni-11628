It's one of the most easy and classic italian dish that I love. I recently found it with picture at http://www.cookiesfromitaly.com/recipes/spinach_ricotta_prosciutto_cannelloni.htm

Excellent cannelloni and pretty easy to make. I used fresh pasta sheets and cut them to size. I don't think the recipe was clear on the 'no boil' because soaking for 15 minutes wouldn't have done much to dried pasta. Anyway the result was fantastic and I see that I forgot to add the eggs, oh well! guess I didn't need them.

great recipe - extremely easy to prepare. i decreased the amount of spinach and added basil and sauteed, hot italian sausage.

Decided to make this mid-afternoon for impromtu invited dinner guests. Made a few modifications due to time restrictions: used oven ready cannelloni noodles; and store bought pasta sauce. I substituted Itallian sausage in the filling. Quite spinanch-y (as per another reviewer) and I would probably only use one package next time. Also used low-fat ricotta and found it worked just fine. Very yummy recipe. Smells great cooking.

cook from Aptos, CA... doublecheck your definitions in the epicurious dictionary. manicotti vs. cannelloni has nothing to do with pasta vs. crepes... it's all about the size of the pasta. I didn't make this recipe, but if anyone has Julia Child's Italian cook book, the cannelloni recipe is the absolute best I have ever found & I have been receiving accolades for it for years- Julia knows her stuff! my family always makes crepes for the cannelloni. it probably takes about the same amount of time as making fresh pasta, but somehow it seems easier!

To LA Cook: Cannelonni are made with pasta, and manicotti are made with crepes. Won ton and eggroll wrappers are a poor substitute. Use no-boil lasagna sheets softened in water if you can't make home-made pasta.

I do not like commercially made pasta. The best cannelloni is made with home made pasta. Top Italian chefs in my city tell me my cannelloni is the best because I hand-make my own pasta, and my own tomato sauce, in my home kitchen. Everyone loves it. If you would like my recipe I will send it to you..........but it does take a little time to make! Jeannie Gandar

I agree with the reviewer who said one box of spinach is plenty. I only used one and it was more than enough. I also used low-fat ricotta with this, and it seemed to come out fine. I used Classico Spicy Red Pepper sauce with this, and the peppery sauce was a good combo with the spinach and cheese. I liked this recipe enough, just wasn't bowled over by it. The leftovers were great for lunch, I must say. By the way, I found the prosciutto to be quite incidental: I barely noticed it in the recipe. You could easily skip it and never miss it. In fact, if you wanted a kick to this, use pepperoni or some spicy sausage instead.

Recipe came out very well. I ended up with 16 cannelloni, though because of the size of my lasagna sheets (approx. 5 X 7, from Barilla brand). It took much, much longer than 15 minutes to soften the pasta sheets, closer to 45 minutes. Also, I used 1 box of spinach instead of 2, and found it to be plenty "spinach-y". The recommended Winter Tomato sauce was also very good with this recipe. It makes plenty of sauce, if you're a sauce person.

I used the filling from this recipe and made the cannellonis with egg roll wrappers. I made my own tomato sauce (with Ralph's store brand pureed tomatoes -- disgusting! I will never buy them again! Couldn't get back to the store so managed to spice up that nasty stuff into something edible!) I topped the red sauce with Christina's cream sauce (from Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni on this site). It came out really good despite RALPH's lousy tomato puree. One point: 2 boxes of spinach is too much; one would've been enough. Otherise, very nice flavor. Don't add too much salt since the prosciutto is pretty salty. The egg roll wrappers worked okay but next time I will make the crepes from one of the manicotti recipes on this site. In my experience, manicotti has always been made with pasta, while cannelloni is made with crepes????

After reading the other posted reviews, I see I am the only one to have prepared this recipe exactly as written. While it was not a difficult dish to make, it was time consuming. The effort was fully justified, however, because the cannelloni was absolutely fabulous! I was very impressed with the results.

This dish was pretty good. We had to use pancetta instead of prosciutto because our market was out of it that day but it still tasted fine. There are probably better recipes out there for cannelloni but this one certainly holds its own.

This recipe turned out just 'wonderful'. It took about 2 hours from start till finish, but it was well worth it. I wasn't able to obtain the instant lasagne noodles, so I bought pre-made cannelloni shells. Also, I made my own tomato sauce from scratch. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

Made this recipe exactly as shown EXCEPT I made my own version of the sauce... onions, garlic, stewed tomatoes, plenty of spices (oregano, cayenne, garlic/onion powders, etc.), tomato sauce and paste. This was DELICIOUS! and earned rave reviews from my guests. A bit messy to put together, but well worth it.

This was a fabulous recipe; however, I modified it slightly. I used only one package of spinach, 1/8 cup of parsley, and 2 eggs. I also used more prosciutto, laying it flat over the filling before rolling instead of chopping it in with the filling. It made for a better presentation. Lastly, I used a creme sauce instead of a tomato sauce, which added fat and calories, but also added much more flavor. Excellent dish!!!

I thoroughly enjoyed this lasagne, the best I have had in fact, though my husband thought that some sour cream on the side made up for not enough creaminess in the lasagne. I didn't feel it needed anything added but I don't like a lot of fat in my diet. I made the dish as lasagne in layers instead of rolling up as canelloni. I did a layer of tomato, layer lasagne, layer of spinach mix, layer of lasagne, layer of spinach mix, layer of lasagne then lastly topped with layer of tomato. Sprinkled parmesan on top.
