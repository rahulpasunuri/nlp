After a few additions, I got what I was looking for. I added a touch of cornstarch to thicken the mixture. I also added some brown sugar and some mint. The carrots had a nice glaze and a sweet, fresh flavor. Thank you to the cook who suggested adding mint. Great idea!

These were pretty good -- a nice way to fancy-up carrots for dinner.

I cut back on the lemon juice to just a squeeze. Thought they were delicious.

I suggest 1 tsp instead of tablespoon of lemon juice, or maybe 1 + 1/2.

This recipe is better with a few modifications. Steam carrots as usual or in a covered bowl in microwave w/butter. After carrots have steamed place in single layer on baking sheet and drizzle with honey, then sprinkle brown sugar on top. Bake at 350 until brown sugar has carmelized -- about 10 mins. Very good!

My husband and I liked this very much. I took the liberty of adding some mint and some fresh ground pepper. Big hit in my house.

Couldn't get this "glaze" to work. Not very inspiring.

What a waste. You're better off just steaming some baby carrots and adding a little thyme and butter for seasoning.

i could taste more lemon than honey. Mine also never formed a glaze.

I was disappointed in this recipe. The carrots were not really glazed, they were simply seasoned with a slight touch of honey and lemon juice. Not what I was looking for.

The best honey carrots I have tried! I have used many recipes before with honey and sugar and this was by far the best! Slightly sweet and easy to prepare. I added a touch of parsley for color!

What I like about this dish is that it allows itself to maintain its "support" role in the dinner (i.e. not take over the main event) but still enhance the usual.

This is more like a "wash" than a "glaze." I think of a glaze as being sticky and coating the food, not just washing over it. Even after adding more honey, it was thin and uninspiring.

I just found it to be very average.

Carrots are not that exciting, but my guests raved about this treatment of them.

This recipe is very close to the amish style. I found that living alone, this was easy to fix.

I am always looking for difference recipes and this one fit the bill. Easy with nice flavour.
