I thought these were quite good and a nice change of pace from the usual lemon bar (which I love). The lemongrass and coconut are subtle, for sure, but the notes are there and delightful. But the BEST thing about this recipe was that it called for metal pans!!! I have always been disappointed in my lemon bars--crust just never crisp enough. The answer is as simple as a metal pan--who knew???

I used four stalks of lemongrass and used a larger part of the stalk and, like many other reviewers, didn't find the lemongrass flavour that strong. Regardless the square is delicious and decadent. I also cut out 1/2 a cup of sugar in the lemongrass portion and skipped the icing sugar. Got rave reviews but I wasn't overly impressed.

I used key lime juice and lime zest instead of lemon juice and lemongrass. They turned out delicious.

This was a beautiful cookie. I didn't have quite enough lemongrass, so I added the zest of two lemons. It may have overpowered the lemongrass, but I could still taste it. I did not add the powdered at the end. These bars are already very sweet.

Loved this recipe! It was absolutely delicious - strong lemon flavor and the coconut crust added a little something different than traditional bars. Everyone eagerly devoured these. I made it exactly like the recipe. Only challenge was that I spread the crust too thin and high up the sides of the dish and once I poured the liquid part of the bar in the crust seemed too high. But that will be easy to adjust next time now that I have a better sense of the proportions. This is a keeper!

Subsitute peel of one lemon, approx one tablespoon, for the lemongrass

I blame you, Epicurious. I've had to make these 2x this week because my husband has become addicted to this lemony, coconutty delicious treat. I'm not really big into sweets, but I do favor lemon & lemongrass. These really did it for me. Relatively easy and packs a big flavor punch. I'm pretty sure my husband and I are 5 pounds heavier, but it's been worth it ; )

I was surprised to read the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly (you cannot really provide feedback if you change everything about the ingredients and process.) I should have followed my baking instincts to reduce the amount of coconut, increase the lemon factor, and use a much smaller pan. These were not much more than lo-rise mediocre shortbread squares with a thin frosting of semi-lemon. There are much better recipes around for similar bars.

This is the best lemon bar recipe so far, the flavors go really well together, I only wish I could find the lemongrass more readily at my supermarket. Quick and easy!

This was terrific and very easy. Based on a reviewer's recommendation I substituted lemon zest for the lemongrass, and these bars are the essence of lemon.

This is a fabulous variation of the standby treat, Lemon Bars. It's hard up here in the Rockies to find fresh stalks of lemongrass, so I used just over half a tube of Gourmet Garden lemongrass paste. I took these bars to a potluck and they disappeared in minutes. Would like to try making the crust as shortbread, cutting it into long rectangular bars and dipping half in chocolate to serve as cookies.

I used lemon juice and rind, substituted coconut oil for butter, my kids loved them,even the one who hates lemon. Will definitely make again.

This was my first time making lemon bars. And I thought they were delicious. And the only reason I made them were because of the lemongrass. I would be interested to see how much difference lemon zest would make. The crust was superb and definite keeper.

Can these bars be made ahead and frozen?

Sounds delicious and I may give it a go. Just a question for A cook from Jacksonville - how much lemon zest would you substutute for the lemongrass?

Except for the lemongrass substituted for lemon zest, this is almost a duplicate of an old Southern Living recipe for lemon bars that I've been making for years. Lemon zest is a better ingredient.

These were easy to make and tasty. I agree with other reviewers that the lemongrass did not appear to add much to the taste, I think they could have been more "lemony" so next time I may add some lemon peel.

This recipe caught my eye - the coconut shortbread crust is a definite keeper! The lemon filing is nice and tangy. You really can't taste the lemongrass so I would omit the next time I make it. I plan on adding lavender or rosemary instead of the lemongrass next time around. Will let you know how it works out.

This recipe tastes great. The coconut crust is sublime! When I got my new issue I saw the word "Lemongrass" I was smitten. Love the stuff. That being said, the lemongrass is all but discernible underneath the lemon juice. I was disappointed at the lack of lemongrass flavor. If you're looking for a punch of lemongrass, you won't find it here. But you will find an amazing recipe that got rave reviews when I served it.

This recipe is a keeper! These lemon bars are fabulous! Interesting twist with the lemon grass. Make sure you finely chop the lemongrass before you pulse it in the food processor because you don't want strings of lemongrass in the bars. I accidentally used Meyer lemons but it worked out great, especially if you're not that into the tartness of normal lemons.
