There I was, 30 minutes before dinner was supposed to be on the table and all I had was two packs of frozen chicken breasts. I threw them into the microwave for 12 minutes to defrost while I popped online and looked up a piccata recipe, knowing I had some fresh lemons laying around. The breasts defrosted, I cut off the too-cooked chunks and sliced the rest in half, even though they were still pretty frozen on the inside. I grabbed a sledgehammer from the toolbox and a freezer bag, and pounded those puppies till they were thin. My family is gluten and dairy free so I threw half a stick of Earth Balance Buttery Sticks into the pan along with the olive oil (accidentally skipping steps in the preparation), salted and peppered the chicken, and dusted them with brown rice flour. Into the pan they went, clock ticking, hungry kids and husband setting the table. A few minutes later they were brown on each side, out went the chicken and in went the liquids. That's when I realized I had no capers; oh well, too late now. Poured the sauce over the chicken, sprinkled what parsley I had left over, and served with rice and broccoli. The result - a revelation. Absolutely the most moist, tangy, lovely, lemony, delicious chicken piccata I have ever had, much less made.

I thought this recipe was the best chicken piccata ever!!! I made it for my daughter's 1st bday for 50 people! I had a chicken Marsala on the side too so I multiplied this recipe few times, for 30 servings. It came out so good, every one loved it! I love the lemon flavor, never too much for me! Very simple and easy recipe. I'll make it over and over again!

This was very good. I made it with boneless skinless chicken thighs. Next time I will only use 1 tablespoon flour for the roux. It seemed a little thick even after I thinned it with more wine. My guests loved it.

Not bad...you definitely have to keep tasting while mixing in the lemon juice and broth/wine to find something you like. And it's definitely not great reheated...it's an eat it after you make it thing..the fried chicken cutlets should have been a tipoff :-)

I have had Chicken Piccata at different restaurants hoping the sauce is as good as this one. It was thoroughly enjoyable with a cream consistency for the sauce. Heavenly lemon taste, not too tart. I added more chicken broth, lemon and wine to make the sauce a thinner consistency. Excellent recipe.

This was such a simple and delicious dish. Definitely on the zesty side. I will definitely be making this again and again. I didn't have all of the ingredients, but I find most recipes to be general guidelines anyway (except baking). I followed the chicken prep to the letter except I used boneless skinless thigh fillets instead. For the sauce I used blanc de blanc instead of white wine. I didn't have any chicken broth, so I used just water instead. Added lightly sauteed diced red bell peppers and 3 crushed cloves of garlic (which I removed after the sauce was done). Also, I didn't have any parsley. No measuring, just eyed the quantities, but my sauce was not gritty or gravy-like. I served it on a slightly wilted bed of spinach with penne pasta (heavy on the spinach, light on the pasta). This is an excellent base that could be used for so many sumptuous variations.

It is simple and perfect. For me just a little butter added to the saute (since everything is better with butter) and some extra lemon juice and capers. Serve with pasta and a green salad.

Delicious! Doubled the recipe (except for the roux given other reviews). I omitted the capers because I don't like them; but otherwise followed the recipe (I had 3 batches of chicken, so kept it in the oven at 225). Served it on top of angel hair pasta and French green beans. A real crowd pleaser.

RE: ACookFromNY's comment regarding the sauce - most restaurants do not use the flour/butter mixture. They use more liquids to start with, then reduce it over low/med heat until it is the desired thickness and add some butter to the sauce at the end to make it creamy. I only used 1/8 c lemon juice and 3/4 c white wine and reduced it over med heat by about 1/2 its original amount. I don't use capers so I did substitute some sauted mushrooms and served this over a bed of angel hair pasta and got major raves. I WILL definitely be doing this one again!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I'm currently madly in love with a chicken piccata dish at a local restaurant (Michael's Valley Grill) which is served over a smoky grilled romaine, and was hoping to replicate the dish at home. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and cut back on the lemon and the flour, and still found the sauce to be too "gravy-like". The sauce should definitely be thinner. I'm going to try other chicken piccata recipes to see if I can find a better one.

I've made this recipe several times. I always add cherry tomatoes and broccoli to the sauce and serve over farfalle. It's very good. As other reviewers have said, the sauce is thick and gritty when made as the recipe outlines. I recommend using about 1/2 the flour (add slowly to your liking.)

Made this for dinner last night and it was delicious! Very easy to prepare. It is quite lemony, so if that isn't your thing this dish isn't for you. I used the entire roux for the sake of richness, but wound up thinning out the sauce a bit with extra chicken stock. I also added artichoke hearts at the same time as the capers. Had to use fresh thyme instead of parsley as that's what I had on hand. Served over angel hair pasta with rosemary focaccia bread. This will definitely be a repeat player!

The sauce was not quite right, but showed potential. If I were going to make this again, I'd use way less lemon juice and about 1/3 less flour in the beurre manie. Also this time, I used an egg mixed with a teaspoon of milk, dipped the chicken into that before dredging it in the flour (to which I also added a bit of panko for crispies!) Rather than the scant amount of olive oil they recommend, turn the heat all the way up and use generous vegetable oil to really get your fry on! I think it would have been gummy otherwise.

Great flavors and fairly easy. I echo all of the other comments on the thickness of the sauce. I had enough to serve, but I would have preferred it 30% thinner. I will try this again and see what I can fix.

i definitely agree with those who say the sauce turned out way to thick. i've tried other piccata recipes before and haven't had a problem, but i kept trying to thin out the sauce and no amount of liquid seemed to work. the sauce really covered only 2 of the chicken breasts since i was serving it with orchiette. if i made this again, i would definitely put in half the amount of initial flour (1 tbsp or less, instead of the 1.5 tbsp). the sauce never recovered from the initial thickness for whatever reason. i would probably make it again with less flour. i also served this with sauteed artichoke hearts.

Loved this recipe-used it as a guideline. Had to go back to the kitchen and get more bread - for the extra sauce in everyone's plate.

I thought the sauce came out a bit to thick under the given directions, but with a touch less butter and a splash more wine, lemon juice, and chicken broth it was absolutely delicious. I thought it was easier to just cook the broth about a minute and a half after I started the chicken so the sauce was completed shortly after the chicken.

really easy and delicious. I made extra sauce just in case and it was all used. enjoy!

In the end, this dish was very delicious but I had difficulty with the preparation of the sauce. I actually made it too think the first time and had to redo the entire sauce. I also doubled the sauce recipe because it wouldn't have been enough for all the chicken. Be very careful in adding the flour to thicken the sauce... do it just a little at a time and whisk it while on a low flame. It was a great meal overall and highly recommend it. Just be careful or you'll end up with pudding instead of a sauce!

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked the chicken right before my guests arrived, let it hang out in the oven (oven was off but still warm from other things), and left the pan with all the drippings still in it. While my guests ate their soup course, I popped in the kitchen, put the oven on low, and finished the sauce. Delicious! No leftovers at all! Really great simple meal for a dinner party- classic and easy.

I have been using this recipe for many years now. My first review was 3 years ago, I think. I think that using the "recipe" doesn't work. You will need to adjust everything ... and taste is constantly as you go, checking the consistency, as well. This dish has become my staple. I love it!

I was looking for a recipe for FISH piccata and decided to try this one, except with fish. It worked great except I thought it was a little too lemony. Next time I'll definitely cut down on the lemon. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, there was too much roux and even though I added it slowly, bit by bit, the sauce still got a little too thick and I had to add quite a bit of extra broth to thin it back out. Even so, my husband loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

This is fast, easy, and the best chicken piccata recipe. I get rave reviews when I make it for company and always get asked for the recipe. This is so easy it's an "I don't feel like cooking" meal because it takes nothing to whip it up. Comfort food at its best.

A piccata dish is traditionally a lemon, butter and caper sauce. If you don't care for those ingredients, don't make a piccata dish. This is easy and delicious. I serve it with spaghettini or angel hair pasta, salad and bread.

We loved this dish, thanks to the previous warnings about the sauce's consistency and overpowering lemon flavor. Add the butter/flour mixture to the lemon/broth/wine gradually instead of dumping it all in at once so you can manage the sauce's thickness. I ended up discarding about 1/2 of the prescribed butter/flour. I also added more broth and wine to subdue the lemon, and I dusted the chicken with bread crumbs instead of flour. With that said, this was very tasty and surprisingly quick to make.

I don't know about the butter & flour roux, because I've never needed it, but I add grated parmesan to the flour into which I dip the chicken, and it adds a nice depth and crispness.

I made this on Friday and I added fresh chopped tomatoes towards the end just to heat the tomatoes without overcooking them. I have to agree this dish would be a lot better without as much capers.

I served it over angel hair pasta. Family raved over it!

This is one of the best chicken picatta recipes I have come across. Instead of cooking the chicken thoroughly, I partially cook it and add it to the sauce at the end for a few minutes. Makes the chicken extremely tender. I also double the sauce recipe Sometimes I change it around a bit by adding whole roasted garlic cloves and baby portabella mushrooms. I also have included sundried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. It is so good it does not matter what you put in it!

Rating: 3
Very nice! My boyfriend loved it. I'd rate it at 3.5 forks with the following variations which were key: (1) followed others suggestions and used less capers and more wine and broth; (2) heavily seasoned flour for dredging with salt, pepper and some other spices; (3) sliced the chicken breasts in half horizontally (and cooked just 1 minute each side - this made for the most tender, perfectly cooked chicken) (4) added sauteed mushrooms and pancetta to the sauce*** huge improvement. With these additions, it was excellent! As written, the recipe probably only deserves 3 forks or less.

My friend had a slightly different and VERY delicious variation: He pounded the chicken and dipped it into a mixture of (raw) egg and a bit of coarse brown mustard. Then he coated the chicken with store-bought bread crumbs. The sauce, itself, was made the same way as in the recipe. Over a bed of tortellini and sprinkled with coarsely ground pepper and parmasan, it was fantastic!

There are a few dishes that I always like better in a restaurant - this must be one of them. Like previous reviewer, I thought it was a bit time consuming for the end result. My husband said he liked it "enough" but we didn't love it. I thought the lemon flavor was nice though - as is.

This was delicious! I was trying to match the Cheesecake Factory's Chicken Piccata so I tweaked it a bit - added a pack of mushrooms after cooking the chicken and boiled them with the sauce and substituted heavy cream for the additional butter and put this over angel hair pasta.

I made this last night and was quite pleased with the results. I doubled the sauce and used fewer capers. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand and I think the recipe suffered a bit from my usage of dried. Otherwise, very good and EASY. Served it w/ brown rice and a fresh salad. Solid recipe.

I was skeptical reading all the reviews about it being too lemony as I LOVE lemon, but agree it was too much. But, it's a very easy recipe to adjust to your taste. I followed exactly except kept adding broth (wound up using a whole can) and a little more wine to get it right for me. I used the juice of one lemon (freshest I could find) which was not quite 1/4 cup. Next time I'll also decrease the capers a bit. Served with spinach fettucine, salad and a good tuscan bread. The extra sauce was great over the pasta. This is a keeper, just adjust to your taste in the sauce, and I agree as written it's not enough.

The first time I made this I stuck to recipe pretty much... but I added sliced mushrooms and unmarinated artichokes and server with angel hair pasta. Since I have been looking for a recipe for lemon chicken scallopine, I decided to tweak this the second time since it was so close. I added crispy pancetta strips, sliced mushrooms, artichokes, garlic, and heavy cream to the sauce at different times. The result was DIVINE! The best dish I've ever made, hands down. It was so perfect I want to make sure I can get everyone to try it. Amazing!

I have never written a review in 7 yrs of using this website, but I have to write one after reading others' reviews. Piccata IS lemony, by definition, tart and lively, not heavy, even refreshingly "cool." Secondly, mushrooms are earthy which does NOT mix with lemon. If you must add something to this recipe, try wilted, chopped spinach. Thirdly, garlic is NOT piccata; its flavor is too heavy and warming for this dish. Adding these ingredients may be good, but it is NOT piccata! My husband argues that angel hair is not an ideal pairing for this dish (although I disagree on this point), that a more substantial pasta like linguine or fettuccine soaks up less sauce and pairs better with the chicken. I agree with other reviews that the flour-butter roux is unnecessary, you must always rinse capers, the sauce must be added over the chicken at "plating," salt is the proper balance to tartness, and that with a good, unsalted broth the sauce can be stretched. We really like the Cook's Illustrated recipe for Chicken Piccata with its garnish of lemon slices.

The person from Marblehead (reveiw written in 02) does give the best advice. My changes were...I dipped the chicken breast in an egg/milk mixture before dredging through the flour. I kept the lemon juice at 1/4 c., wine (sav blanc) at 1/2 c. and chicken stock at 1 c. I was trying to create more sauce. As a result, I did have to eventually use some of the butter with about a T of butter creamed together to get the sauce the right consistency. Cut the capers in half too.

Rating: 2
A good recipe, but needs some tweaking. I found the amount of lemon juice excessive, which meant I had to use a good deal more salt than I'd planned to balance it out, and the sauce thickened more, and more quickly, than I'd anticipated after adding the butter-flour mix. I think next time I'll up the chicken stock content, lower the lemon juice and reduce the flour. Otherwise, the end result was very tasty and it's very easy.

I make this recipe often and each time I am getting better and better at making it just right. It has become by far one of my favorite recipes. I slightly adjust the chicken broth and wine when cooking this recipe. I tend to use more of them both. I find it hard to flatten chicken breasts so sometimes I cut them in half and flour them that way.

The biggest downfall of this recipe, I think, is that if you follow the recipe exactly...the sauce turns out too thick. What I did to remedy this was just add more chicken broth & keep whisking. In the end, the sauce was able to be salvaged & I thought it tasted very nice. I have printed out the suggestions from the 9/5/02 review from Marblehead, Mass b/c I think he/she has it right on how to perfect this recipe. I certainly won't use the flour/butter mixture again, possible cornstarch mixed w/ broth towards the end as some other reviewers have suggested.

This is a standard at my house. One suggestion I would like to add: slice the chicken breasts laterally and pound only to create uniform thickness. This will tenderize the chicken while keeping the filets more juicy.

My kids liked the chicken, not the sauce; my husband raved about both. I do think the sauce is a bit on the sophiscated end for kids. I will make this again with the following caveat- will cook the roux first and then add the liquids. I found it difficult this time to boil the liquid first and then add the roux. It was hard to get the lumps out. Also used olive oil, instead of butter, to keep it non-diary. Very easy to make, and will definitely make it again.

I have tried other chicken piccata recipes, and this is the best! The only changes I made were squeezing lemon on the chicken about 30 minutes before cooking and that I made the sauce in a separate, small saucepan, adding it to the pan after sauteeing and removing the chicken, for the brown bits, then simmering a few minutes before pouring it over the chicken.

This was a good recipe. However, make sure you double the wine and the broth, even triple it. I made this dish with fresh pasta and the sause was alitle short, so I will make sure to make more the next time. Also, I added mushrooms and some garlic to this dish, it was an excellant addition. This was a pretty easy dish, I will definately make it again...

I made this according to the recipe, and it was WAY too lemony. I made it again, cutting the lemo0n by half and by adding a little more salt to the chicken, and got RAVES from everyone, including my 7 year old.

Delicious and easy. I used boneless skinless thighs, because we prefer dark meat, and pounded them thin. Since I always keep a supply of them in the freezer, this is a perfect solution to a last minute meal.

I love this dish and always keep the ingredients on hand for stand-by. I suggest adding some lemon zest and slightly cutting down on the juice. You get great lemon flavor and a little less tartness.

I LOVE THIS DISH!!! I took another reviewer's hint and thickened the sauce with a touch of corn starch mixed with chicken broth, then finished with the butter. The flavor of this is absolutely wonderful. Served with garlic butter rice..delightful!

My girlfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe! I didn't change a thing (except I went a little heavier on the capers...love those capers.) I served it with Near East cous-cous (takes about 5 min and is available in most supermarkets) and a ceasar salad. Yumm! Also, remember that lemon and salt are contrasting/balancing flavors, so if the sauce feels too salty, add more lemon juice; if the sauce feels too lemony, add more capers.

Rating: 3
This dish was delicious and simple. The only adjustment I made was to leave out the butter/four mixture. I didn't want a thick sauce. I also added a bit more broth. Lemon flavor was wonderful, but you definately need to use fresh lemon juice. I will make this again and again!!!

Rating: 3
Great! Easy to work on other parts of the meal while the chicken is cooking. I recommend less parsley and less lemon. Over all, very good.

Rating: 4
Wonderful!! I had my butcher slice the breasts REALLY thin. I doubled the sauce ingredients(just the three liquids) and added the capers and parsley at the very end. Served it with the Persian Rice with Dill and Pistachios on this site and everything looked beautiful and tasted delicious. We found the amount of lemon perfect and not bitter at all.

Rating: 3
As a result of the reviews, I did less flour in the beurre and a touch more wine/broth in the sauce. I also didn't flatten the chicken (ugh) but just fried it longer, with a cover on for half the time. It was lovely. Yes, it was tart, but if you don't smother the chicken (and I did more sauce than called for as I only did three chicken breasts) it certainly isn't too tart.

Rating: 4
Add sliced mushrooms, and add capers at the end to taste instead of following directions (just look to see how much looks right). Add minced garlic to the olive oil when cooking the chicken. It may be too lemony, but that might be because people have used bottled lemon juice. What were you thinking? No way, fresh all the way, and reduce the amount of lemon juice a bit, increase others to compensate, and it's great. I've also made it with the amount of lemon called for in the recipe, and I thought it was a *little* too lemony, but my friends loved it. I use cornstarch mixed with cold broth instead of flour to thicken, and just added the butter to the sauce by itself. Friends who have eaten it before have requested it again when they come over for dinner. I've made it many times now! Yum, yum, the chicken is so tender.

My husband and I worked together to make this, and that reduced preparation time to about 15 minutes. The results were FANTASTIC. He says definitely easy and fast, and I love piccata, so I am satisfied. I will try the other piccata recipes, but this one will be the one i bring out to guests!

This was great! I took the advise of others and added only half of the lemon. Left the butter and flour mixture out but added additonal broth and wine. Added garlic cloves while cooking the chicken..and it turned out great!!

Thanks to the comments of others, I cut the lemon juice and capers in half. It is quite good. It still has a strong, but not too strong lemon flavor. Helpful comments are what help make this site. The sauce was a little thick so I will try adding more wine and broth next time using the advise of the previous reviewer.

Rating: 2
I'd make this again, but only with significant changes. First, this produces a heavy, gluey, gravy-like sauce, not the light, lemony sauce which usually characterizes this dish. Next time I'd leave out the flour, except for dredging the chicken breast in. Secondly, 2 tblsp. of oil doesn't do it--you'll need at least 3. Thirdly, in order to avoid a sauce that tastes overpoweringly of lemon, you'll have to double the amount of chicken stock called for and use a couple of more tablespoons of wine. The best way to produce a great piccata sauce is to deglaze the pan first with the wine, scraping up all the delectable brown bits and stirring until the wine is somewhat reduced and the liquid begins to thicken. Next add the lemon juice and chicken stock and bring to a low boil, stirring constantly. Finally, remove the pan from the heat, stir in the butter to finish the sauce, and add the capers and parsley.

It was super easy, but definitely has a strong lemon/caper flavor. I will make it again because my husband LOVED it.

I cut the lemon juice down by half and it was still a bit too much lemon... I would suggest 1-2 tbsp. The sauce has a very nice texture to it.. Instead of dusting the chicken with flour, I dredged the chicken in Italian breadcrumbs and finished with a garnish of chopped roma tomatoes. Overall, I would probably make this again.

This was WAY too tart, I had too add tons of more stock and wine to make it eatable. However, I did give it another shot, using only half the juice and adding a teaspoon of shredded lemonpeel instead. That way, you get the lemony flavor without the tartness. Delicious! Served with parmesan risotto and grilled vegetables, it was a great hit with everyone. Yum!

More and more I find myself praising recipes that have simple ingredients and are easy to make, not to mention delicious! This is one of those recipes... I did not really change the recipe and it came out great. I am blessed with a lemon tree that renders the most incredible lemons, hence a wonderful flavor for the piccata. Those plastic lemons are gross, don't use them in any recipe calling for lemons. You are guaranteed to ruin the dish :(

Quick, easy and delicious! I think that fresh lemon juice (not bottled) is the key to this recipe. The sauce is so outstanding that I doubled it the second time I made it. This WOW'd my entire family and is going to be a part of my regular menus.

Rating: 3
Nice piccata, but I use key limes, since lemons aren't available here, so the taste is smoother. Definitely recommend rinsing the capers, especially if they're salt packed. The beurre manie may foreign to a lot of people, but the one I've always used is one part butter to one part flour, less than that and you risk lumping, and the recipe calls for 2 to 1 flour to butter, maybe it's a misprint? Also, add it slowly until the sauce is thickened..the amount given in the recipe is really too much. Frankly, the sauce would thicken up nicely with just a pat of butter and a little reduction, since there's already flour in the mixture from the dredging of the breasts.

It's too rich. Piccata is supposed to be light.

This recipe is fantastic!! I had been trying for years to duplicate the wonderful chicken piccata that is served at the Cheesecake Factory. This is as close as I can expect to come, and I love it. I served it as a special meal in my house and it got rave reviews, then made it again this past week and it's wonderful every time - even left over. The lemon is not overpowering, though I would think that fresh lemon is really the key to its mildness (bottled lemon juice has that strong acidic taste). Try this - it's easy and delicious!

Very, very tasty! I loved the lemon flavor (as written), but agree with the previous reviewer that there is no need to use two skillets - unless your chicken doesn't fit in one and you want everything ready to eat at the same time. I will be making this again!

Rating: 3
This was great, but the instructions are silly. You do not need to use two skillets! Also, I see no reason to mix the butter and flour together. Just smooth the flour with a little chicken broth and slowly at some of the warmed sauce to that before whisking in. I always like more sauce and added more chicken broth and wine to accomplish this. Super weekday meal with roasted potatoes and yams.

I made this recipe last night with modifications as I did not have fresh Lemons or Capers. I used concentrated Lemon Juice and Unmarinated Artichoke Hearts. I doubled the White Wine, Chicken Broth and Lemon Juice. I served it ouver Angel Hair Pasta which I tossed lightly with Truffle Oil. My husband, 2year old son Jack Henry and 9 month old daughter Grace Anne loved it! It was fabulous and I will definitedly make it again. Next time I will try real Lemons and Capers to see if it is even better ... Bon Appetit.

This is delicious, but as others have said...too much lemon (and I used fresh). I did a quick fix after I tasted it, and added more chicken broth (almost double the amount) until it was better.

Next time I'll try adding just a tiny bit of minced garlic.

I have been making this recipe since it was published, and it is the perfect combination for a great piccata. I have subbed veal, fresh halibut and even shrimp for the chicken. The secret to the lemon juice is to only use fresh squeezed! And fresh lemons.

I have been making this version of Chicken Piccata, a classic, since it was published in 1998. I have found over the years of making this recipe, that it depends on how old your lemons are to how tart the outcome will be. Older lemons are more tart than younger ones. I start with half a lemon and add as needed. You can use the amount given as a reference point. It's always easier to add more than try to compensate for adding to much, thats the beauty of cooking. As for the saltyness some reviewers experienced, it is the capers, a MUST in Chicken Piccata, that causes the salty flavor. The solution is to rinse them before adding to the pan, adding as it suits your taste.

I thought the recipe was good, however I made a few changes. I lightly breaded the chicken with progresso Italian breadcrumbs after I floured it, and squeezed the lemon on chicken while frying. I also sauted shallots in a half stick of butter (in the skillet I cooked the chicken in) and then added the flour wine and capers (no lemon) until the wine was cooked off and the capers were soft. I omitted the parsley. I served this on top of buttered fettuccine. This was hit at my dinner party.

I agree with the other reviewer who said the sauce was too lemony. I love lemon, but I ended up diluting this sauce with cream and more chicken broth.

I agree with the other reviews, the lemon is strong, so I add a little less. Thin the sauce with wine at the end - and I like the idea of not mixing the flour and butter, and only adding unsalted butter - soften the wonderful sauce a bit. This sauce would also be great over grilled chicken. Best chicken piccata I have ever made, without a doubt - served with steamed broccoli and angel hair pasta with garlic and olive oil sauce. Delicious. Enjoy!

I am sorry a chicken had to lose its breasts for this dish... my boyfriend and I did not even finish our portions...

I agree with the cook from Boston on 1-9-00, I took his/her advice and doubled the wine, and broth (actually I probably quadrupled the broth) but kept the lemon juice at 1/4 cup. It turned out pretty good. I will definately make this again with the same revisions.
