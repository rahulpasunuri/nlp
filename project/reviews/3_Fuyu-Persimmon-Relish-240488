I had high hopes for this recipe, based on Traci Des Jardins' excellent reputation. Unfortunately, this recipe disappointed badly. The combination of flavors was strange. The appearance of the relish was unappetizing. I wound up throwing it all away and racing to the store for cranberries!

The near-end of Fuyu season coincided with Thanksgiving this year, and there was a bumper crop of less-than-perfect persimmons in the local market for $.80 a pound. This recipe was a great twist on the traditionally cranberry condiment, and not an ounce was left after dinner (confession: I did label the dish since the dinner was served buffet-style). Sherry is a must, but red wine vinegar worked just fine, as did small raisins instead of currants. I went with a little less salt as well, about a teaspoon. The one thing I won't do again is blend 1/2 in the food processor. Not only does it muck up a bunch more dishes unnecessarily, but it detracts visually and texturally from the dish (the relish in the picture doesn't seem to have been blended). Spend your time instead on making a really nice small dice on the persimmons, approximately the same size as a plumped currant or raisin, depending on what you are using. Great dish to bring to a pot luck because you know no one else will be bringing it!
