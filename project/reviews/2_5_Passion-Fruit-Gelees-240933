I thought the recipe was great i increased the cooking time on the final step by 3 minutes and used a ceramic dish to mold them in with plenty of oil(almond) i also used perfect purees for my fruit additive tried raspberry,blood orange, and mango all worked great!!!

I have made these for the last 3 years and have never had the problems mentioned here. I coat them twice with regular granulated sugar. The first coating does tend to get a little weepy but the second "fixes" that. my husbands family is Cuban and they LOVE these jellies made with Goya or Lafe puree. I have given them as gifts and everyone seems to like them.

I made these when the issue came out and loved them. I am going to make them again this afternoon using blackberry puree. Mine have never weeped and I live in South Florida. Everyone loves them and they are gone before the 2 week storage that is mentioned.

Very easy and delicious and they looked just like the picture. My only problem was they did not come out of the pan after setting. I had to cut them into pieces while still in the pan. Since I have enough of the puree to make another batch I will line the pan with plastic wrap. That should solve the unmolding.

I thought that these were fun to make, but like other reviewers I had a problem with them weeping. I took the advice in the recipe and sugared them right before I took them to work, but they were a mess just 15 min. later when I got them there. Some people still really liked them and some were almost too scared to even try them! I did get the comment that children would probably love them. I went to a grocery store that has a high number of hispanic products and finally found frozen fruit puree; they didn't have passion fruit so I used guava. This was an interesting recipe, but I don't think I will make it again.

These were very delicious! I didn't see all the negative reviews until after I finished making them... I used Looza's Passion Fruit Nectar (in a bottle) that I found at Shopper's and they turned out great! Not bland at all. I used an 8x8 pan and used my fingertips to gently pull the sides away from the pan after they had set. Then I just overturned onto a wax-lined baking sheet. They cut beautifully (used a few long, even strokes with very sharp knife). I also experienced the weeping problem, but only with the gelees that were not eaten during the party. I would estimate that it took about 3 hours for the weeping to take place at room temperature, so that is your magic window for serving these dusted with sugar. I thought they were delicious. Definately an "event-oriented" dessert; not something I would use as a gift.

Followed recipe to a tee and they were too gummy, too sweet, sticky. Not what I expected.

The flavor of these are quite good & they cook up easy enough. I used a disposable 8" pan & just turned the pan inside out when unmolding & had no problems, also if you sugar them right before serving then the weeping won't be a problem, that sort of kills it for a gift idea though. For those of you having problems finding the puree, a sure bet is at a local Central American grocery store in the frozen section. This is one of those recipes though that even though I like the flavor I don't think I'll make it again beacause I know how it's made. There is so much gelatine in this that the smell of it cooking is absolutely revolting, & I can't get the smell of it out of my house. Perhaps that's just one of the joys of candymaking? I don't know it's all new to me. We'll see how my guests like it.

I am a big fan of the pate de fruit you find in France, so was hoping this would be similar, but was sorely disappointed. I tried to find passionfruit puree but couldn't (went to Balducci's, Trader Joe's and Harris Teeter) and finally settled for frozen mango chunks, which I pureed. I ended up doubling the amount of puree because the 3/4 c just didn't seem to add any flavor to the gelatin mixture (which was pungent). And then it occurred to me, pate de fruit isn't made from gelatin -- it's fruit puree and pectin! Still, I'd gotten this far so I let it sit overnight. It gelled fine, and I used a mini cookie cutter to cut out shapes and rolled those in sugar, but still had the weeping problem, AND they were just plain sticky with not very much flavor. I won't bother making these again but will try my hand with pectin.

just an update...the sanding sugar DID dissolve into the candies. As a matter of fact, I found that the granulated sugar was a better coating for the gelees, but I agree with the reviewer below that they're impractical unless you are planning to serve them to guests immediately after rolling in sugar. Storing them after sugaring is a bad idea.

I just made Jacques Pepin's Raspberry Pate de Fruit today and they are chilling overnight. In response to those who had trouble with "weeping" I noticed that even though his recipe calls for granulated sugar (I imagine because it's easier to find), he explains that the French candymakers use sanding sugar because it does not dissolve into the candies. I checked my sanding sugar from Williams Sonoma and is does have a few ingredients added to it (confectioners glaze and carnauba wax). I'm hopeful that if I coat mine in the sanding sugar they will not weep. Also, he instructs to keep them refrigerated-- I think Jacques' recipe makes more sense and the raspberry version was easy because it called for frozen thawed raspberries, raspberry jam,etc...good luck everyone with your holiday candymaking. I'll let you know how I do!

These were so impractical that they're not even worth making. I had no problem with the texture, but once you coat these in sugar, they start to "weep", making a big mess. As a result, I couldn't add these to my cookie platters, or give them away, because I knew that they wouldn't hold up. Too bad. they looked so pretty in the picture!

I couldn't find passionfruit puree either. So I made my own strawberry puree. The flavor came out good, but the texture is too lose for me...I thought they'd be more gummy drop type instead of jello. They do indeed "weep" after being sugared. I had no problem unmolding and cutting them, I used a silicone 8 inch square pan which probably helped. I don't see how these can keep though. Definitely not in the frig as those ended up in a puddle. On the counter before being sugared, perhaps. I've got some in individual candy papers post-sugaring, hopefully they will last a day until they are gifted.

the recipe sounded simple and delicious, so i tried these last night. this morning, they had set, but just barely - they were so soft, they couldn't really be cut and didn't hold shape. the texture was like very wet jello - not candy consistency at all. rolling them in sugar wasn't even possible. I'm not quite sure what went wrong! i may have to try again, because the flavor was fantastic.

I live in Hawaii and was skeptical about leaving them "at room temperature" for both the gelling time and afterwards. I also had trouble getting them out of the pan, and eventually loosened them enough for them to flop out in an odd- shaped square. They felt really soft to me, but after the sugar-rolling, they looked beautiful. My husband said they were a bit sweet, but I reminded him they are candies.) HOWEVER, even in an air-tight container with wax paper between the rows, I had the same problem of finding them this morning in a puddle of syrup. I had put a few in the fridge to test keeping them in there, and they did seem to have held onto the sugar. Will try to dig them out and re-sugar later, then refrigerate. Did anyone else find that there were conflicting instructions about how they "keep"? One said they keep beautifully for up to a month, the other said keep without sugaring for 2 weeks. Gourmet? Are you listening? Room temeratures need to be specified! I will try again though as they did look lovely! Aloha!

I've had much better versions of these. Too much gelatin and not enough passionfruit flavor.

For the person in Baltimore who couldn't find the puree. I found it at our local Giant Eagle. It's in the frozen food section near the other frozen fruits. Good luck.

Have not made this yet but wanted to pass along this tip: There is a Jacques Pepin recipe for Apricot Pâte de Fruit here: http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/apricot-pate-de-fruit He lines the pan with waxed paper that extends 4 inches past the edge of the pan and uses it to unmold the candy.

I would love, love to make these, but cannot find the passion fruit puree! I have tried all the regular grocery stores (giant, safeway, superfresh) as well as several latino markets, a big asian supermarket and trader joe's. I live in a fairly big city, but cannot for the life of me find this darn puree!! Where did you all get it?

I too had trouble getting the gelee out of the pan. I just set it in a pan of hot water and it came right out but be careful not to let it sit too long. A little tricky to cut but probably would have been easier if I had also dipped the knife into hot water. The taste was delicious and I loved the texture but we will see how it stands up to keeping. I packed them in plastic wrap between the rows and sprinkled sugar both on bottom and on top hoping this would keep them from sticking. I will check them out in a couple of days and see how they are holding up and will report back.

I made these for Christmas goodies too. I could not find passionfruit puree so I used concentrated fruit juice. Since that was sweetened, I just cut the sugar I added to the water in half. I cut mine in the pan too with a plastic picnic knife. I doubled my recipe and used a much larger pan. Mine are also weeping and dissolving the sugar, but overall, these were quite easy to make. We'll see how "the public" feels when I give them away. I just love this web-site. It helps to read these reviews and see what fellow cooks are going through. Please feel free to E-mail me @ heysuey@silverstar.com PEACE!

I did not like the way these came out. I made this for Christmas gifts, but the gelees keep weeping liquid and dissolving the sugar.

Such a simple, fool- proof recipe...and fun to make with the kids. Enjoyed a great father/son evening making these treats. Not overly sweet, as I expected from the quantity of sugar. Very kid- friendly "jello" treat with a sophisticated flavor that adults will love, too!
