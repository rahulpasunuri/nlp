I found this recipe while looking for something to do with the radishes from my CSA share. The salad was wonderful, light and the citrus flavors were great with the radishes. I did end up using more radishes than it called for.

A great way to showcase fresh radishes. I used a much higher ratio of radishes to lettuce and tossed the radishes in a small amount of dressing beforehand. I added some baby arugula and fresh taragon from the garden. I think I would have liked some sherry wine vinegar in the dressing as suggested in another salad with radishes from this site. I also did not toast the pine nuts. It was a nice combination.

Excellent recipe. My boyfriend says it's the best salad he ever had. I used spinach instead of red- leaf and added a bit more orange and lemon juice than called for (and a tad less salt). Forgot to roast pine nuts before adding but it was fine. Enjoy!
