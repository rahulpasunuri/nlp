Great recipe. You really can't do anything wrong to it if you cook it long enough. I sauteed all the vegetables first for about 10 minutes. Make it the day before and reduce the sauce with all the solids reserved the next day. I'm not the type to purchase two juniper berries, so, I can't comment on that.

To reviewer queenoftheworld from Aurora, IL, I purchase my juniper berries from Whole Foods in New York, NY. The brand name is: FRONTIER.

Very good. When I find juniper berries I think it will be even better. The sauce was awesome over mashed potatoes, green beans on the side. MMM.

This was wonderful, even without the juniper berries, which I couldn't find on short notice. The one thing I did differently was to not discard the veggies. Instead, I removed the herb bouquet and pureed the veggies. When added to the strained broth, it made the sauce just the right texture and I didn't have to use arrowroot or cornstarch. Fantastic sauce, and the shoulder roast was perfectly tender.

I followed the recipe and give it four forks. I'm always amazed at those who rate these recipes without useing the proper ingredients. I used a Malbec wine, reduced the sauce by half and added a knob of butter. This was fantastic and will be my new cheap meat dinner. I used a chuck roast and made it the day ahead.

Hey! I am rushing out to buy a juniper bush. Do not be caught without one!

We have a big juniper hedge in front of our house. Could I use the berries from it?

I got juniper berries at Williams Sonoma for another use. Was just wondering about another use for them, and I found this. Looking forward to making it!

Gin is flavored with juniper berries, you can substitute a teaspoon of gin for the 2 berries.

We're lucky enough to have a shop dedicated to spices, and they carry juniper berries. But if you don't have such a place, you can get them from a number of places on the web, including Amazon.

The flavor was great but where in the world do you buy juniper berries? Not whole foods. Not the usual grocery stores. Needless to say, it's still good even without the 2 juniper berries. The meat was tender.
