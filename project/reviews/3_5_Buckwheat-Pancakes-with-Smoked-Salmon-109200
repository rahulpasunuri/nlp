I just tried this, taking advice from others and mixing sour cream and cream cheese for the topping. Neither my husband nor I liked it. It wasn't terrible, just not very good. We had one each, then I ate the rest of the pancakes with syrup, my husband made a bagel sandwich with the salmon and cream cheese. I've made appetizers like this before with crackers or toast, and it's way better that way than with pancakes.

I agree with another reviewer who said that the sour cream didn't hold up in texture so she used part sour cream and part cream cheese. I ended up adding cream cheese to the topping mixture after constructing a few with just sour cream. (I then also added a lot more chives and some more salt.) It may be important that the pancakes are warm, and by the time I served these, they weren't. I also made one for my husband using a rice cracker instead of a pancake, and he said he preferred that. I think they might actually be better using soft wheat crackers instead of pancakes, and would be a lot less work! I'll definitely try serving them that way in the future. Also if you search for this recipe title on this site's search box, some variations come up that might work just as well or better. Overall I definitely think it's an impressive keeper with some modifications.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner and it was a big hit. I thought it unnecessary to beat the egg whites separately, so I just beat them together as I would for regular pancakes, and the result was perfectly light and fluffy. I used good quality organic sour cream, so I didn't have a problem with consistency. I can't wait to make this one again.

I'll use cream cheese if I make this recipe again. The sour cream doesn't stand up to the texture of the salmon that well.

I served these, passed around on trays at a large cocktail party. For such a big crowd, I beat equal portions of soft cream cheese and lowfat plain yogurt with an electric mixer instead of using sour cream. Many guests were astounded to learn that I hadn't hired a caterer, and one man who doesn't ordinarily like smoked salmon, deemed this rendition the best he'd ever tasted. The next morning, the topped pancakes hadn't gone soggy (sour cream might have made them soggy)so my kids were happy to take the leftovers to school in their lunchboxes. They were the envy of all their classmates. Excellent!

I'm Russian and I've never heard of such a "complicated" recipe for pancakes! Usually we just mix flour, water, salt and sugar (eggs and milk or sour milk can be added too) together and that's it! But I definitely like epicurious way of making pancakes. Pancake hint: sometimes we add a small amount (1/10 of a teaspoon) of baking soda with a drop of vinegar on it. Baking soda with vinegar make some king of bubbly reaction, with makes your pancakes soft and plump. :-)
