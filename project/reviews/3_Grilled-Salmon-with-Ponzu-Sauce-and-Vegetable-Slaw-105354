I would rate this LOWER than 1 fork if I could. Made as directed (squeezed fresh oranges for the juice), except I baked the salmon and poured the sauce over when it was half done. I love salmon and ponzu...but this is just TERRIBLE!!!!

Perfect. A HUGE hit at my dinner. Ponzu sauce is delish. However... I did it with Tuna steaks. I also added a vegetable "slaw". I julianned cabbage, broccoli and carrots and mixed in a bottled miso dressing. It added a nice simple touch.

Absolutely fantastic! I used a store-bought ponzu sauce and the flavor was excellent.

very good and simple recipe. I generally marinate the salmon in olive oil and S + P before-hand for an extra moist variation. I did't have sake and tried a rice wine substitue(other ponzu recipes will use rice wine vinegar) but it didn't turn out the same. Also tried to double the recipe, but didn't reduce enough so was runny. I suggest sticking to the exact recipe in portion size and ingredients.

The ponzu sauce is great (and easy)! I served it with seared ahi tuna as an appetizer and it was a hit.

Very tasty and very easy! All I ever make are variations on the maple/dijon salmon theme and this was a welcome change. Serving the sauce on the side definitely puts it over the top.

It was delicious and I wouldn't change a thing - it was a big hit. I served the sauce along side and everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe several times with rave reviews. I brush the salmon several times with the ponzu during the cooking process. I also serve some of the sauce with the fish.

Good, but not great. Not sure if I'd make again. Used salmon steaks, and used 1/2 recipe. Needed to put sauce on fish after it was cooked, otherwise, it had no taste.

A very good recipe. It is simple and lets the flavor of the salmon shine. I used low-sodium soy sauce and sprinkled some sea salt before serving. I only made the sauce and then grilled the fresh wild Pacific salmon with my Le Creuset grill. It was delicious. I served it with sauteed spinach, julienned Japanese cucumbers, and Japanese rice. It was quick, and will make this often.

Great flavor! I cheated because I had a bottle of Japanese Ponzu sauce in my pantry. I red pepper flakes to make sure it had a little zing. I am going to save this Ponzu sauce recipe so I don't have to drive 20 miles when I run out of the bottled sauce. I also made the Vegetable Slaw which was worth the effort and a good accompaniment to the salmon.

The recipe verbatum is excellent. It's taste is a little lost on the salmon once the slaw is put on. My husband seared the salmon and it was incredibly most. The sauce could be used for dipping - it is a well balanced hot/sweet blend.
