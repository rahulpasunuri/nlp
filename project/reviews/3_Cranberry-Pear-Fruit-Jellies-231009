Really great recipe for a delicious treat. Using very firm pears is a must. Don't worry- there will still be plenty of good pear flavor, but you really need the firmness. The recipe is a real mess to make- multiple batches in the processor, pushing it through the sieve, etc., but it's worth it! I cooked mine about 10 mins longer than the recipe said, at a good simmer the whole time. I wondered if some of the folks who had issues had their heat too low so at 45 mins, it was just too thin still? IDK. I cooked mine down to something between a very thick fruit syrup and a thin jam. Like others, I also had issues with mine absorbing the coating sugar after about 2 hours of sitting out. Don't see any way around that, though, so just coat them right before serving. Also, I DON'T agree with a previous reviewer who recommends using sanding sugar to combat this. I think those crystals would be much too large, crunchy, and overpower the delicate nature of these pate de fruits. Just go with the superfine and coat right before serving.

I don't usually write reviews, but these were awesome. Cook it until you think it's done, then cook it for another 10 minutes! After you cut them, leave them in a container, separated and then coat just before serving with sugar. If you use sanding sugar, it won't dissolve as quickly.

I made these last night and cooked the sauce for about 65 minutes. Let it chill over night and today I am able to cut into 1" pieces however when I coat with sugar it absorbs and becomes very sticky and soft. I am wondering if anyone else let them sit out a little while after cutting to see if they dry out a little?? That's what I am going to try.

this really does have to get to a past. I cooked it for upwards of 80 minutes. I used the certo brand. Here are some pics and directions: http://kitchensidecar.blogspot.com/2009/01/festive-pear-pomegranate-fruit.html

you really have to cook the sauce for a while to get to the 'paste' stage. it took me 2 tries to get it down, but it was worth it!

Terrific--I wanted to "copy" the Liberty Orchard jellies I can no longer find except at Xmas. Be careful that the pears are not very ripe though, or the jelly will not set up (because the pectin level in the pears drops as they ripen).

To the cook from Arlington Virginia. I made these confections last year using BALL's liquid pectin to total success.I found the pectin at the local hardware store in the canning section. (STROSNIDER'S) I'll be making again soon.

I live in the northern va area and can't seem to find liquid pectin anywhere. I've tried M.O.M.'s, whole foods and giant. Does anyone have any suggestions? I also visit baltimore occasionally if there are any stores up there that might have it.

A sticky mess. The taste was delicious, but I too, had trouble with the mixture gelling. It "wept" which made the superfine sugar turn into glop. If I did make it, I would skip trying to mold it and cut it into cubes.

For all you New Yorkers-Come to Jersey Liquid Pectin in Shop Rite and Kings. My jellies came out soupy too. Bottom line..If you make these and they are liquidy, use it as syrup for pancakes!! The taste is great.

I had the same problem as one of the previous cooks with the jel not setting in the fridge. It had a nice firm skin on top that would have been the proper consistency, but underneath it was fluid! No idea what to do except maybe increase the cooking temp in an effort to cook off more liquid and firm up the end product. Anybody else have some ideas?

Tasty; however, it did not turn out at all even though I followed the directions scrupulously. Even though the sauce passed the freezer test it did not jell at all in the fridge. When I took it out to cut it into squares (with T day guests waiting in the wings) it was the consistency of applesauce. So I ended up using it as another cranberry sauce. It tasted good, but I had polished my grandmother's silver candy dishes just so I could put these jellies on them. Annoying!

These were a bit time consuming, but well worth the time! Delicious - very sweet and fruity. The cinnamon adds a nice touch.

I haven't made these yet. It's 2 days before Thanksgiving and I can't find liquid pectin on the upper west side of New York City. I have tried Gristede's, Fairway, West Side Markets, nobody carries liquid pectin. Any ideas where I can find it in NYC?? Thanks!

I didn't have cranberries on hand, so I tried the recipe using 100% (unsweetened) cranberry juice. In addition, I used blue sugar crystals to coat the jellies, and the contrast was very pretty. Tasted very good, too, and I don't even like jelly candy!

As soon as I saw the recipe of these confections in the latest issue of gourmet I had to try.They turn out beatifull,only a little darker than the photo ,probably because I used red bartlett pears.I am wondering if this recipe can be used with other fruit conbination, like rasberries and pears or srawberries or apricots ?

Refreshing and different! A nice confection for those who don't want anything very rich.
