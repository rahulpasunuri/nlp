after reading other comments about too much gelatin i made this with about half the required gelatin and it set fine and didn't seem at all gummy. it had a nice texture. i struggled with making molds or lining ramekins with plastic, so i gave up and used stemmed sorbet dishes and just served the frozen mousses in those with the sauce poured on top - they were still very pretty. the taste of the mousse and strawberry sauce together was great. would like to try again with different presentation.

I made these in giant muffins tins lined with plastic wrap and they turned out great. THis recipe also doubles very well. I made a fresh blackberry coulis and it turned out amazing.

Very disappointing. The gelatin makes the texture rubbery, as others described. I should have known better, but I was expecting the frothiness of a mousse rather than the gumminess from gelatin. I won't make again. On the plus side, it was a beautiful presentation, and the flavors were good!

Rich and creamy but the gelatin gives it a light texture. I used paper cups for molds and they slide right out after setting at room temp for a few minutes. I substituted a sauce made from melted blueberry preserves with fresh blueberries stirred in and garnished it with a strawberry 'rose' on top. Beautiful tall presentation!

The gelatin in the mousse made the consitency too gummy for my taste (and I'm sure I measured out the right amount). Also the strawberry sauce was underwhelming and watery. Tasted good though, maybe better if used less gelatin

This dessert's presentation is beautiful, but I found that one teaspoon of vanilla was excessive and detracted from the lemon flavor of the mousse. Next time I will use only a half of teaspoon of vanilla.

Perfect! creamy texture to the mousse and the sauce was a winner. the molds and the recipe itself take some time, but definitely worth the effort for a special occassion. It drew raves from my gourmet club.

I liked this recipe well enough, but thought the portion was too large. The mousse is quite rich, so the next time I make it, I will make it in smaller ramekins.

I have made this dessert several times and everyone always loves it. The flavor combination of lemon, strawberry and mint is delicious. Plus, it is very easy to make. Be sure to use the foil molds because it makes an impressive presentation. A great spring or summer dessert!
