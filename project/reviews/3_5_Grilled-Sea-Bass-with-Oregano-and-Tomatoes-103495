Using white anchovies and coarsely chopping the capers improves this dish by reducing the salty sensation of biting into a whole caper.

I would have a hard time calling a Puttanesca sauce "just". If you are a good cook and use quality ingredients, this is suberb. We followed the recipe exactly, except for a larger proportion of kalamata olives, and served polenta, broccoli (dressed with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic), and Sangiovese with it. Great dinner!

This is just a Puttanesca sauce over grilled fish. A simple dish to prepare in a rush, but not a "wow" dish.

Added a little Old Bay as well as lots of fresh pepper to the tapenade. Extra garlic too. Served with farfalle with butter and fresh sage. Nice balance. Darn tasty.

Thanks Jeff for the biggest and best laugh I have had all week. I think I will continue to enjoy the recipe as written

I'm from the midwest where fresh sea bass is difficult to come by so instead I substituted ground beef which I formed into fish shaped patties. Also, some of the other ingredients were beyond me so I used a package of tuna helper. My guests loved it and it was so easy to make!

I made this dish with one difference I used monkfish and giant shrimp. the sauce came out very salty. we have wonderful ingredience available and I think that our anchovies and kalamata olives are probably much larger than other areas. It totally overpowered the seafood to the point were I took the plates back to the kitchen washed the seafood in white wine drizzled it with virgin olive oil and garlic thyme vinegar and replated it on a bed of arugula.

Very good and quite easy which makes it a great dish for entertaining. I would try without the anchovies as the olives and capers provide enough salt and flavor.

This "sauce" was very good. I was unable to have all of the ingredients in this, so I made it without the last two ingredients. It was very good without them. Being salty by nature (the anchovies and capers)it was fine for me.

Very flavorful. Quick and easy to make. The sauce would be delicious over pasta too -- but over grilled fish it's amazing.

I served this for my fiance and myself. We've been trying to cut down on our carbohydrates in the evenings and this dish is both flavorful and non fatty.

I loved this recipe,the tapenade topping was very flavorful. Next time, I will cut down on capers and anchovies because it made the dish a bit too salty.

Very quick to make and delicious! It's reminiscent of puttanesca pasta, and a remarkable blend of flavors. Will repeat often!

This is delicious! However, my local market doesn't sell sea bass -- they said it's because it's been overfished and is now on the endangered species list -- so they recommended halibut and it worked out very well; it's sturdy enough to hold up to grilling. I served it with pasta and spooned a little of the sauce on the pasta.

I've done this many times now to rave reviews. Anything Zov cooks is out of this world. The fresh oregano is very important!
