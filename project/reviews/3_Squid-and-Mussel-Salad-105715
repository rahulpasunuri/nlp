sooo simple...soo fresh. Next time I will add shrimp and omit the endive.

Very nice, light. Make exactly as written, altho the previous suggestion about shrimp & tomatoes might be nice too. Served with butternut squash risotto and it was a nice complement to a risotto altho the salad seemed a little too "summery" with that particular risotto dish. So easy, would definately make again!

This is an awsome, do-ahead first course that's perfect to serve before a filling entree. I added a pound of poached and halved shrimp to the mix. I sliced the fennel and onion very, very thin, and still didn't use it all. Added some sliced, seeded cherry tomatoes and a couple tablespoons of cilantro. Made the dressing pretty much as written, doubling it, using a bit more good olive oil, and maybe 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to counteract the tartness. Served the salad in a radicchio leaf in a glass dessert bowl with two garlic croutons/toasts on the side. Great combination with the main course of Osso Buco and Risotto Milanese.
