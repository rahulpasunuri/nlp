It seemed like a lot of steps, but it's basically a sponge cake and it is really really good. Too good. My son has celiac and I made it for a recent visit of his family - he loved it. The whole family including little kids loved it as well. I would not change a thing.

I didn't have coconut or coconut flour, so I used all almond flour for the cake and substituted brandy for the rum. For the icing, I made a 7-minute frosting, using 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. I also spread apricot jam on each cake layer during assembly. It was a hit with everyone, including non-celiacs. The cake layers when cooled were somewhat misshapen, so I trimmed them, but I may have put too much almond flour in at a time when mixing the batter. Looking forward to giving it another go and playing around with flavors....

This recipe tested my baking abilities and I think I "lost" and "won" equally. I was in my mother's kitchen, subject to her "tools" and knowledge of where to find things. This made the execution of the frosting flawed and highly disappointing. Mixing bowl and attachment in the fridge for at least 15minutes=check. Chilled heavy cream=check. Correct attachment=FAILURE. I used the "beater bar" attachment instead of the "whisk" so my "peaks" were non- existent even after toiling for at least 20minutes. They didn't curdle as everyone warned, but they didn't thicken. The cake part came out well, although I used wax paper instead of parchment and the bottoms stuck a bit. After refrigerating my "soupish" frosting and praying for a miracle, hours later the frosting had thickened but I blew the recovery attempt. I saved the day by substituting the "coconut frosting" (quadrupled)from the banana cake recipe found here on epicurious. The final outcome was rockin' and devoured in minutes. I will take my loses, 2hours and $$$, for a successful product. Cheers for all you bakers who get peaks without a problem; I bow to you!

This cake is amazing - I made it for a party and everyone raved about it, even those who eat gluten. I agree with other comments here that the frosting curdles easily and does not need to be whipped for as long as the directions indicate.

A time-consuming cake given the chilling required, but worthwhile and not difficult. My layers collapsed a little after baking. Did others have this issue? Perhaps I just need to buy new, NON-nonstick baking pans. As Deliusfan has noted, it's impossible to get the frosting to stiff peaks. Be satisfied with lovely medium peaks or deal with curdling! Enjoy :9

I made this cake for a friend's birthday. Because he is celiac, there were other gluten free desserts. This one disappeared long before the others. It was delicious! Cant wait to make cupcakes with this recipe!

I rarely provide reviews but this cake is heavenly for those who have to have gluten-free food. I have made this twice already for a coworker but even people who are not restricted to a gluten-free diet rave about this cake. You do really have to be careful when whipping the cream, stop at medium peaks or it curdles with the batt of an eye. It also does not take the amount of time stated, it will firm up in about half the time.

I am so disappointed with my non- existent baking skills. The cake had the right consistency but it completely felt apart when I tried to take it out of the baking pan. The frosting was really delicious but it curdled on me. SO FRUSTRATING! My son has Celiac and his birthday is in September...I will try again...But the cake and the frosting tasted really good...I used white chocolate with coconut

I have made this for my mother-in-law's birthday for the last three years, as well as the occasional family gathering, and it's been a hit every time. There are several celiacs in the family and they enjoy it, yes; but the non-celiacs eat it up as well. Mother's day is coming and... you guessed it, this cake will be on the dessert table once again, enjoyed by everyone. The frositngs can be varied--chocolate, raspberry jam, lemon curd, ganache--so it can suit any occasion. To gild the lily, serve with chocolate-dipped strawberries.

I have made this recipe 3 times, after the first time I made it, I got requests to make it again and again. My friend's son does not like cake and when he had a piece of this he said, "this isn't cake, this is heaven." this is on my again and again list.

OMG, this cake is super fussy but fantastic! My Celiac husband has decided that this is his all time favorite birthday cake.

This got rave reviews -- including from the gluten eaters. The only problem with it is that you use a lot of bowls to make it. Also, I just barely had enough frosting, although with the coconut on, it looked fine. Still, it would have been easier to frost if I'd had another 1/2 -3/4 cup. I'd consider making just two layers, which would leave plenty of frosting, but I don't know if this kind of sponge cake would work with bigger layers. Does anybody know?

A cook from Aus- I haven't made this cake yet, but since it's similar to a chiffon cake (in that there are so many eggs), There are a few tricky things. One, make sure you get your egg whites really stiff and make sure to fold into mix very gently. It doesn't have to be perfectly combined either. Two- I've had terrible results making chiffon cakes on days that were humid, so check the weather report. Three- Don't grease the pans, it doesn't say to in the recipe, but it doesn't say not to, the cake needs the sides to climb up, otherwise it slides down. Definitely use the parchment paper though! Anyway, a few thoughts for you. Hope it turns out well! And Im giving the recipe 4 stars for being gluten free, for now, but Ill make it and re-review!

I am making this for a celiac dinner party next weekend and did a test run of the cake portion last night - it was quite good, but not particularly fluffy or 'sponge' like. I assumed this was fine - given the flours being used - but then I looked at the picture this morning and the layers there seemed quite sponge-like. What have been people's experiences in this regard? I got barely any raise during baking, and the result was a light, moist, but fairly thin and not particularly fluffy, layer.

Just an edit to below; I reread the icing portion of the recipe, and I did get to soft peaks before adding the white chocolate. What I meant to say is don't try to push it past medium peaks or you very well may curdle the cream. I used amaretto rather than rum, but surely this shouldn't have mattered. Maybe someone more versed in the natures of spirits can educate me on this one.

A delicious cake that I can't wait to try out again. I had never made a three layer cake before, so this was quite a project for me, especially as I was rushed for time with the rest of the menu for 10 I was trying to make! The cake batter looked absolutely beautiful, though; so very light and fluffy. I will say, though that I was very frustrated by the white chocolate icing (used El Rey discs from Whole Foods; made sure it was gluten free!) as I was really trying to go for medium peaks when I looked away for literally 5 seconds, and then looked back to see the frosting begin to curdle in my Kitchenaid mixer. Maddening. I don't know if the others were more careful than I, but I really don't think you're going to get much further than soft peaks. If you get peaks at all, just stop, as you don't want to ruin the texture of the icing. This was the only thing I didn't like about the recipe, but it was my own fault, so I will definitely try it again. Good luck!

OMG delicious cake. Being a celiac, I am concerned about the people using Lindt chocolate bars. Although the white and dark chocolate bars do not contain barley malt (the milk chocolate and trufffles do), but there is a possibility of cross contamination. For those who are extremely sensitivie to gluten, I would avoid using Lindt.

This is a fabulous cake! I ground coconut for the coconut flour, increased it by 1 Tbsp, then added 1 tsp. coconut extract and used coconut rum. Also added xanthan gum (1/4 tsp. per cup of flour) and 1 Tbsp. Expandex (modified corn starch). As advised, I chilled the frosting overnight, then used lemon curd/frosting/lemon curd for each layer of filling. Next time I plan to use pineapple preserves to get a pina colada flavor.

I am always looking for gluten free recipes and this is one of the best. I found that Lindt has a wonderful White Coconut chocolate that is perfect for the frosting - gave it a lot of flavor. The Lindt chocolate bars were easily found at both Wal- Mart and Walgreens. My non-celiac friends absoluted loved the frosting and the cake. I also had to make my own coconut flour and found that it was easiest to leave the flaked coconut out to dry before grinding it in a spice grinder. It was a beautiful cake and I will be making it many times in the future.

Since it's a hot day, I'm having major issues w/ the frosting. I made the frosting yesterday, baked the cake today. This cake doesn't take long to bake, rather it's the waiting in between that takes a long time. So if you want this cake for a particular event, plan accordingly. If I were to do it again, I'd make this cake with a different frosting just bec. it's really hot out and this cake has to travel in a car. Otherwise, the cake is lovely. I had to increase my baking times by 10 mins bec. I used silicon pans.

I made this cake for Passover - HUGE hit. Made the cake (added a drop of coconut extract and a little heavy pour on the Rum) increased coconut flour - by a tablespoon, and filled and frosted with plain whip cream - and schreded coconut - whole family asked me to make it again

This recipe was very disappointing. I am sorry that I did not use the lemon curd filling, because without it the cake had no flavor at all.

I followed the recipe exactly including the frosting. It was delicious. Everyone loved it but they are right about the time it takes for the frosting to firm up. I would suggest making the frosting the day before.

This is a great recipe! I haven't made a cake in 4 years(forgot how much work they are!), since I discovered I have celiac. A few notes: I found it took much longer to beat the egg yokes for them to be pale & fluffy (about 10 minutes)-and they were never what I would call "fluffy". (maybe because I don't have a whisk attachment) Used regular rum & couldn't find coconut flour so as per other reviewer, just ground up coconut flakes. Frosted with a whipped cream & lemon curd frosting. Served at a dinner party to raves.

Made this for my mom who needs to eat gluten-free foods. The cake did have a golden color during mixing & upon completion but the taste was not what I expected. I used Lemon Curd for the filling w/ white chocolate shavings and sliced strawberries on top. The cake did look very nice.

I haven't made this yet but I am so excited to find these recipes! Also the advise about how to make my own flour. Now there are some recipes I have that use very little flour and I think a substitution of the flour mix would work wonders. Yay for Gluten free recipes Keep Em Coming!

I also used the lemon curd with the whip cream fosting in the middle and I am glad that I did. That gave it some flavor. Then I put strawberries on top of the cake for color. It was a big hit. I just grounded up some of the coconut to make coconut flour. Not sure I would call this a coconut cake since there was very little coconut flavor but it was very good.

I tried this recipe and the recipe for the pizza dough. Both were successes, in my book. I made a seven-minute frosting for the cake, as I am not a white-chocolate fan.

This is an amazing cake. Fun to make and delicious. I didn't have coconut flour so just ground coconut flakes to as fine a powder as possible. Delish.

This is a winning combination of cake, filling and frosting that any dessert lover would love. I didn't have coconut flour so used rice flour instead. I filled the layers with both lemon curd and some of the luscious white chocolate frosting. After chilling well, the cake sliced beautifully and was a big hit at a birthday party for a friend who can't eat wheat. No one would ever have guessed that it was gluten-free, which often negatively pre-disposes people. I will definitely add this to my repetoire, because it is a great dessert.

If you cannot eat white chocolate, I would make a 7-minute type frosting (aka boiled white icing) for this cake, and use lemon curd for the filling. This frosting should be very compatible: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/109595

to "A Cook from WA" - yes, by definition, ANY recipe that is gluten-free (by U.S. standards) is also wheat free...although the reverse is not necessary so! This cake would be safe for your friend to eat.

This is for the user who asked about soy and nut substitutions. They are expensive, but you can get soy free white chocolate here: http://www.soyfreesa les.com/index_026.htm Also, you could make a coconut frosting instead. The nuts are harder, but it can be done. It may be more dense. You could use any prepared gluten- free flour mix (that is also nut free) or make your own mix (typical is 6 parts white rice flour, 2 parts potato starch, and 1 part tapioca starch.) Just make sure the mix contains xanthan gum or add about 1/4 t of gum per cup of flour. Good luck and enjoy it.

Rum comes in many flavours such as coconut, golden, apricot, etc. It is not an extract, but an actual type of rum that can be purchased in any liquor store. Did you actually make the cake to give it the 1 fork rating or is this rating based on not knowing what the ingredient was?

Recipe is a bit confusing. What do you mean by 2 teaspoons coconut or golden rum? Are you talking about an extract?

I was so excited to see a recipe for gluten free coconut cake, as I bake for my daughter-in-law who has multiple food allergies. She cannot eat chocolate because of the soy in it nor any nut products. Could you suggest a substitute for these 2 ingredients? Thank you.
