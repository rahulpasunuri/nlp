A marvelous recipe. BUT EVEN BETTER, as a side dish which is cooked ahead, then transferred to an ovenproof serving dish with the cheese on top and run under the broiler for a few minutes before serving.

Made this for our Christmas Appetizer....EVERYONE RAVED! This is hands down, one of the BEST apps we've come across in a really, really long time. Definitely worth finding real cippoline onions (I used the white ones, not the red ones). Seems unreal that you could eat a whole onion, but it's definitely possible! Great, great recipe! Thanks!
