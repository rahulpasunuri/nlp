"Insanely good"? No. But for a gluten free, no dairy, low sugar brownie, they're very good.

This is a superb brownie recipe - and the fact that it is gluten free makes it amazing. It has a light, crisp texture and the cinnamon/almond/chocolate flavor is superb. I did need to go longer on the cooking time (40 minutes) because with all that melted chocolate, there was no way a toothpick was going to come out clean at 30 minutes. However, I had a baking stone in on the shelf over it, and that may have been problem. I am not a maple sugar fan, so used turbinado sugar instead. Oddly enough, everything else in this recipe was in my cupboard. My husband is sensitive to gluten and this recipe is going to go into weekly rotation at our house.

Hallelujah! Finally a delicious recipe for my son who can't eat corn, wheat, gluten, peanuts! Substitute Frontier Brand Vanilla ( No alcohol ) for the vanilla extract, and your all set!
