My husband and I love this recipe, but we tend to use New York strips when preparing it. I reviewed the recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Delicious! Easy and fresh tasting.

because several people said this was sour, I added a little honey. I thought it was just right, and my whole family loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe. It all depends on the herbs, of course, but if you've got an abundance at hand, it's hard to miss with any combination. I love the simplicity of this. I'm not craxy about steak but this makes it quite wonderful..

I'll bet the herbs you use make all the difference. I used fresh parsley, thyme (always great w/ steak) and a tiny bit of rosemary. It was easy, a little bit different, and very delicious. I even saved the leftover herb mixture and used it the next night with sauteed chicken breasts which were a big hit at dinnertime.

I might have just picked the wrong combo of spices, but Thyme, Basil, and Oregano completely took out the meat.

Lemon juice, vinegar and Dijon......way too sour for my taste. Don't think I will make this particular receipe again
