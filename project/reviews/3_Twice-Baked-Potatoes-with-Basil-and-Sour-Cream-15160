Twice baked are easy and fun. For those of you who dislike the time it takes try a box of instant....OR....(I just did this for my dinner its a bit more timely but very well worth it) I made a mango & pineapple Harbanero sauce and TOTALLY jazzed up the mash for the filler. Try it, it is outstanding. 1/2 Habanero pepper (i know,i spell like poo) 1 mango 1/4 pineapple puree..=)

I should have listened to Heather! I love twice-baked too, but this didn't even cut it. I even tried to doctor it up with bacon and sourcream, and without a yummy success. My suggestion is to find a better recipe!!

I love twice baked potatoes, but I hate the amount of time it takes.... this was a good recipe but I feel that there are other, more exceptional, 'twice-baked' recipes which I'd rather take the time to make.

I really like these potatoes. They are soooo yummy. I didn't add as much basil as it called for, and added cheese and more sour cream of course!!!! My son loves it, it's all over his face.

My kids loved them! It was a nice spin on baked potatoes and gave what they thought was a boring meal of salad and baked pot. a nice zip. I did doctor up the potatoes by using bacon bits, chives,scallions, parmesean cheese, and a handful of cheddar.

I followed everyone's advice and added some fresh Parmesan. These turned out very nicely... I baked them a little longer once stuffed, so that the tops were well browned.

This is so simple, and very delicious. I added parmagiano reggiano to taste before final baking.

Yummy! All gone!! I added cheese and sour cream too, and think that the process is the secret. Extra baking of shell (I put butter and seasoned salt on them) makes them really tasty. My guests ate the shells with gusto.

I add Asiago or Peccorino Romano cheese, sour cream, chopped bacon and chives, Definately bake the empty shells for 10-15 minutes at 350 to stiffen them. I find that using cheddar for this allows the butterfat to seperate from the cheese and you get a greasy potato instead of a fluffy & creamy one.

I tasted the filling before putting it back in the potato skins, and thought it was a bit bland. So I added about 1/3 c. of freshly grated parmagiano reggiano and a bit of nutmeg, salt pepper and heavy cream. I dashed a bit of paprika on top. They were delicious.

EASY, simple and fresh! The only thing easier would be to just bake the potato and eat it! I happened to choose the recipe for it's simplicity and fresh ingredients, so I didn't find it necessary to "tweak" it like others did. I liked baking the shell before filling it and baking again (came out nice and crispy) and this "simple" potato will go nicely with a more spicy meat or poultry. Thanks, again, EPICURIOUS! Kimber

This is a pretty common side dish that I've made many times without a recipe but used it for basics this time. I added more sour cream directly to the mashed potatoes, and omitted the butter, but seasoned them with Cavenders Greek seasoning, crumbled bacon and finely chopped green onions. This is really a MAN PLEASER!

Twice-baked potatoes are a little time intensive, but worth it. I added goat cheese, which made the potatoes creamier and more flavorful. Didn't have basil on hand, but topped them with thyme and paprika--very yummy.

This dish was ok. I found it to be rather bland, even though I added quite a bit of cheddar cheese to the mashed potoato mixture. My husband, who loves twice baked potatoes found this to be very bland also. I think if I make this again, I would add roasted garlic to the mashed potatoes

Very good, something you can make in advance and still look nice. I added the sourcream and cheese directly to the mashed potatoe mixture. To prevent drying out I topped each potatoe with a tiny bit of margarine before baking. Very yummy.

Takes some time, but good. Fresh basil is what saves it from being bland. I baked the potatoes and let them cool overnight in the fridge; they were very easy to scoop out the next day. The potato was still very white. I happened to have some fresh parmesan cheese to top it off with in the last few minutes of baking, which added a nice flavor.

I made the mashed potatoes with fresh chives in lieu of basil and I also added some shredded cheddar cheese. The result was super!

These were a big hit and definitely easy. They looked perfect on either side of a piece meat.
