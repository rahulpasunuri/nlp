These were spectacular. To be fair, I used this recipe as a base for a number of leftover ingredients I needed to use up. So I added about 3/4 cup canned pumpkin, 1/4 cup mashed sweet potatoes, and one small apple grated. I also cut the oil to 1 T and skipped the butter topping. Served these to my neighbors at an impromptu breakfast and all were thrilled!

I made banana pancakes with this honey-cinnamon butter - OMG, so delicious! It's a sweet morning, but not too sweet!

I thought this was a great recipe. You can just make a standard pancake mix with the dry ingredients from a cookbook in place of the store bought mix, then just follow this recipe... Mix the eggs, milk and oil, add the mix, spices and sweet potato. You're good to go. I added an additional 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the wet ingredients. The batter is thick, but I like it that way, it just takes a little longer to cook so use oil instead of butter in your pan. Otherwise the butter will burn. Oh, and I'm going to double the sugar in the batter to 4 Tbsp. next time. Otherwise really good and easy - my 13 month old ate a whole pancake!

wish it did not have a pancake mix, but from scratch.

Made these using Alton Brown's "Pancake Mix" recipe on Foodnetwork's website, skipped the syrup. They were delicious! Next time I would add more cinnamon and a few spoonfuls of brown sugar to the batter to make it even better.

Amazing! A great twist on regular pancakes. I used canned organic sweet potato from Whole Foods and the 365 brand buttermilk pancake mix. Turned out great in a pinch!

Yummy after a few changes! I adapted this recipe to make them non-dairy (making my own vegan buttermilk) and a little healthier by using whole wheat flour, flaxseed meal, and apple sauce instead of oil. They turned out so well even with the healthier changes! Dry ingredients: 3/4 cup mixed whole wheat/regular flour, 1/4 cup flaxseed meal, 1/2 tsp cinnamon (you can add even more if you like), 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cardamom (substitute ginger if you don't have it), 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp sea salt, Wet ingredients: 1 cup of almond milk with 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar (homemade vegan buttermilk!), 2 1/2 tbsp apple sauce (instead of oil), 1/2 tsp agave nectar, 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract, 1/4 cup-1/2 cup egg whites (i just eyeballed the egg whites until i got a good consistency but it looked like about 1/3 cup), 1 sweet potato, cooked, peeled, and mashed (I didn't have time to bake it so I just popped it in the microwave for 6 min on high)

Absolutely wonderful!!! We did the gluten-free version by using the Kinnikinnick pancake and waffle mix. Everything else per the recipe execept we added more honey and cinnamon to the butter mixture.

One more thing, to the cook who had moist, floppy pancakes even after over-cooking - I had the same problem until I realized I had added 1/2 c. flour instead of 1 c. flour. Adding the extra 1/2 c. of flour solved the problem and they turned out beautifully despite extra mixing.

PS - We had extra honey-cinnamon butter and extra mashed sweet potato, so I just mixed them together for a tasty snack later on. :) Same with extra pancakes: cooked and cooled for later snacking. Yum!

I made these this morning with some turkey bacon and eggs. They were excellent. Sweetheart said the texture was just right (and he's picky about pancakes). I followed the recipe except for making my own buttermilk (1 tbsp. vinegar + 1 c. milk) and own pancake mix. For my pancake mix I used 1 c. flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. raw sugar, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, and 1/4 tsp. salt. Oh, I also added about 1 tbsp. vanilla and extra cinnamon and nutmeg. Definitely a keeper.

Yum. These remind me of my favorite pumpkin waffle recipe - http://pumpkinwaffles.wordpress.com/ultimate-pumpkin-waffle-recipe/

I used my standard pancake recipe but used the idea; I put a medium sweet potato and a little bit of cinnamon into it. These was so good for a change. My family are really picky eaters and they gobbled it up. I will be making these again.

Pancakes only - amazing! No changes. Instead of mashing the potato, put all in a glass bowl and used hand held electric mixer to reduce all that solid to a batter. Pan cakes were a lovely pinkish/orangeish color, and light and fluffy. The cakes could make a snack alone, or a wrap or fold to contain cream cheese and jams etc.

I would rate these better if it were not for the texture. They were very delicate so make them small. Mine were too spongy and wet even after overcooking. I'm thinking my sweet potato was very moist or I needed to add more pancake mix - perhaps a sturdier kind with whole grain to give more structure to the pancake. Anybody else have that problem? And how did you solve it - they are tasty so I'd like to play around with it until it comes out good.

Excellent recipe! I had some left over sweet potato mash that this was perfect for. I skipped on the buttermilk and went with 1-1/2 cups soy milk with a full 2 cups of sweet potato mash and it still came out delicious. One recommendation I have is to make small cakes with this. The batter is thick and heavy so it is difficult to flip a big pancake. Enjoy!

Good recipe - the batter was a bit thick for my liking so I thinned it with regular milk. The pancakes tasted good, but the texture was a bit soft! Almost had the texture of mashed sweet potatoes. Maybe I thinned the batter too much...or maybe I added too much sweet potato (about2 cups worth - it was a big potato!) Regardless, I would make this again. Made a good addition to Thanksgiving weekend brunch.

These are fabulous. Everyone in the family from our 11 month old, his 5 year old sister to his parents loved these.

Finally-something my 2 year really, really likes! These were very easy to prepare. I sometimes make the batter the night before for a quick dinner the next night. The honey-cinnamon butter is a fabulous touch!
