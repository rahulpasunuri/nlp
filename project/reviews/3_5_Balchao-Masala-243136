This stuff is fantastic! I always wondered what made Goan food taste Goan. I made it for the Scalloped Potatoes with Coconut Milk and Chilies, but I think I'm going to mix it with coconut milk as a marinade for pork next, or maybe put it in sausage. Or I might put it up in little jars for Christmas presents! You should make it, it's great. (Also pretty hot.)

Knowing my tolerance for heat, I reduced the amount of chiles by half, and the result was the top limit for spiciness. Next time, I might try using 1/3 or even 1/4 the amount of chiles, but for others who tried it, they thought the 1/2 cup provided enough heat.
