Naysayers??? Puh-leaz... this is a go-to recipe. It does not require the overnight stay in the fridge, but of course it will increase the flavor if you are serving it as a sliced pork dish. ...BUT, you can't go wrong by just slapping on the rub, throwing it in for the slow roast, letting it rest at least 20min, and then taking a fork and shredding it. Yes, I said shred it. And serve it South American style with corn tortillas and all the fixin's. I have made a good 60 or more ppl happy with this version in 12 dinners and I can guarantee if you dig authentic SA cuisine and have no idea how to pull it off, this is sooooo close. And so yummy nummmy good! But if you wanna slice it, follow "A Cook From Marin County"'s suggestion of overnighting with the rub in the fridge, but don't forget to bring it up to room temp before throwing it in the oven ;)

Okay, you nay sayers,...All you need to do is put the rub on a couple days (at least 1 day) ahead of time and leave it covered in the fridge until you are ready to cook. I can see why others would talk about lack of flavor so give it some time if its at all possible . I reduced the clove a little as well the second time I made it only because I thought it too strong. I have cooked the onions both before as recommended and added them uncooked with the roast and feel they work both ways. Definitely use fresh Sage. Great on tenderloins too ! Enjoy !

This recipe smelled amazing when it was roasting  well once I could smell again after crying from all those onions! However, the rich scent didn't permeate the meat much. It was a nice roast, but not very special or flavorful. It just tasted like pork. The onions sort of saved it, but caramelized onions will make just about anything delicious. The particular cut of shoulder that I used was rather fatty as well. I served it with a spinach, walnut and dried cherry salad and domino potatoes. Overall, it was a good meal, but the pork was the dud of the three. I'd be interested in trying the rub again on a smaller piece of meat where the flavors might have a shot at showing up in each bite.

I've made this twice and everyone has loved it. I've attempted the onions both ways suggested; as the recipe states and just sliced and piled around the roast, but they ended up being picked around to get to the pork. The next time I will probably leave them out.

I read all of the reviews before I started cooking. My version: I browned the bone in pork shoulder in a little oil (5 min a side), let it cool a bit then patted it with the rub (I did not pre cook the spices). I cooked the onions in the remaining oil for about 10 min then added the water and let cook for another 10. I then put the pork in my slow cooker, poured the onions on top and around the sides (added a bit more water and sprinkled some of the rub into the pot as well). I plan to cook it for about 6-7 hrs in the slow cooker, I'll let you know how it turns out!

Excellent. Don't bother with all the onion prep, just slice, put in roasting tin w/ pork, and pour on water. Also, I didn't use a rack for the pork nor did I toast the spices first, just threw together pre-ground and it all worked out great. Paired with tortillas, sour cream, and rice/beans.

I used a boston butt pork roast and it came out marvelous! I did several things different from the recipe. I rubbed olive oil on the roast and then rubbed on the spices. Then I place the whole thing on a double layering of tin foil. I scattered two large sweet onions underneath and all around the roast, along with the sage. I sealed the whole thing with the foil and then stuck it in the oven for five hours. It had plenty of juices and the meat was extremely moist and delicious! Even better the next day. I served it with two suggestions from the November issue of Bon Appetit (saute of greens & shitake mushrooms and ranch mashed potatoes)

I tried this rub on a small pork roast at 300°F, and it was very tasty. I was a bit skeptical about the cocoa, but we were all very pleased with the taste. I didn't try the onions, but given the other reviews I'd probably try putting them in for just the last hour or so.

Yes, the aroma is amazing, but the flavors intensify subtly overnight so a keeper for a good braising recipe. I heated the spices together, coated the pork completely, placed on a rack and layered the onions all over under and on the pork. Then, I started with 1 cup of water poured overall, and continued to add water once an hour and "basting" with what juices I could muster. In the oven for 6 hours @ 300 degrees was right on. Juices at the end are ideal served over couscous. A keeper for a wintry January Sunday. I'll have to try the rub with venison next time.

Just OK. Yes, the house smelled wonderful, but the dish stops there. The onions burned (used original magazine recipe; not what's printed here) and the white pepper taste is very, very prominent. I'll stick with a braised pork-butt recipe published by the Dallas Morning News in November '08.

We used boneless pork shoulder and were not too thrilled with the outcome. The onions were also burned. We will not make this again.

Great Recipe and Excellent Rub for any kind of Pork. I made this a month or so ago for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. However, due to the time involved in making it I probably will not make it again for sometime. I did double the rub recipe and froze the extra and have been using it on pork loins, tenderloins and pork chops and they all taste fantastic. The rub is a real winner.

Everyone loved it but me. I am not a fan of clove, and this certainly had a clove flavor. To top it off, maybe I put the rub on too thick, but none of the grey sea salt stuck and the rub was a bit gritty on the pork. I even ground it to a powder, but it still had texture. I followed the recipe on the onions and agree now with everyone else, don't cook them and just lay them around...it will be better in the long run.

This was truly amazing!! The cut of pork I used was called a picnic which has less fat than a boston butt but still comes out moist and delicious. My butcher cut off the thick layer of skin for me as well. I also don't have a spice grinder and just mixed the ground spices right out of my spice jar together and rubbed it all over the pork. I don't think it made much of a difference. I saw in the comments that some others felt you didn't need to cook the onions, then add them for so much of the cooking time so what I did was let them really cook down in the pot and added extra water. They ended up almost like an onion chutney or condiment. When the pork had only about 20 more minutes to go, I just slathered it all over the outside of the pork so it would dry out a bit and deepen in flavor. We served it in soft corn torillas with garlicy homemade guacamole. They were fabulous and still delicous the next day. You won't be disappointed with it.

I am in the middle of making this recipe right now and the house smells great. However, I noticed that the recipe has changed since I printed it out on 11/30/07!! The original recipe had the roast in the oven with the onions for 6 hours. The new recipe takes the onions out after the first 3 hours. So, it is hard to tell which recipe is being reviewed. The lesson I learned is "always check the web site before you use a printed recipe!"

I tried this recipe and ended up with a pan full of burnt onions. Is there something wrong with the temperature cited in the recipe?

This recipe is really fantastic! I made this for a dinner party and I've never had such rave reviews for any recipe. The pan-drippings and onions were incredibly flavorful and the meat was moist and perfectly seasoned. I don't think pre-cooking the onions was necessary and wouldn't do that step again. I also upped the temperature to 330 and it only took 4.5 hrs. Word to the wise- if you're not going to buy the bone-in shoulder butt roast, don't bother making this recipe.

a comment on the last comment -- the recipe calls for *bone-in* shoulder roast.

A number of people have referenced a pork roast other than the "Boston Butt" or "Shoulder" cut of meat. If you use a bonless loin roast or a tenderloin or even worse a pre- packaged (ie. highly brined/seasoned) cut then you are defintely using the WRONG cut of meat for this recipe. The shoulder cut specifically benefits from the long and low temp roasting because it has more connective tissue to turn to callogen and more fat to render. Doing the same method to a typical loin roast would have a completely different result. Do yourself a favor, go out and buy a fresh, boneless pork shoulder as the recipe specifies.

Many reviewer's complained about the excess salt. Note that the salt called for is sea salt. Regular table salt is twice as salty. If using table salt, use half as much. Haven't tried this yet, but will with half the salt.

Like another poster I put this in a dutch oven and braised / roasted this. The pork was moist and flavorful. I did use a 2 lb. pork loin and not the shoulder so the cooking time was adjusted accordingly. The onions were served over the sliced pork. This is a great variation for a pork roast recipe. I did use less salt as the other posters noted since we are looking to cut back on this in our diets.

I made this for New Years day dinner.My son said it was the best thing he has EVER eaten.My husband said he couldn't stop eating it.The flavor really was fantastic.I covered the roast for the first 4 hours then added the onions and cooked it uncovered for the last 2.I used kosher salt and it wasn't too salty as some reviewers said. I wonder if they might've used regular salt instead.I will definitely make this moist,tender,flavorf ul dish again.

I did 2 - 5# roasts side by side in my slow cooker- no onions - all else the same and the finish was moist and a keeper.

Heeding others' comments, I altered the recipe by cooking the spice-crusted roast in a covered dutch oven, without onions, for the first three hours. I then removed some of the fat, added the softened onions, and cooked it covered for another hour, and then uncovered for two more. It was very moist, tender, and richly flavored, a hybrid between a braised dish and a roast. I used sea salt and it was not too salty.

Wonderful flavor! A keeper for sure and an excellent Christmas entree. Although I did not pre-brown them as the recipe directs, the onions threatened to burn anyway. I kept pouring in a little water from time to time and this helped a lot. It's amazing how the onions reduce to a little heap, but their flavor is intense. For the rub I used cardamom instead of coriander, of which I had none.

Very nice. I also used the rub on some pork chops, which turned out great. I also added some chipotle power to the run to kick it up a notch - and this worked well also.

This roast did fill the house with a wonderful aroma, but I agree with other reviewers in that it was WAY too salty and the salt was distracting to the flavor of the other spices. I covered it the entire time and it was very delicious and the onions on the top did not butn too much.

Rating: 0
I wonder if the cooks who are finding this too salty are using what is referred to as a "seasoned" roast of pork. They are frequently featured at very low prices, and are delicious, but have been well salted before sale. When I try this recipe, I will definitely add some liquid, cut down on salt, and cover for most of the cooking time.

I haven't made this yet, but it seems like the roast should be covered for part of the cooking, at least half. I would cover in parchment with aluminum over it. I would also keep water in the pan when it's uncovered, just an inch. And this is going to be salty if you don't use the grey sea salt, which is less salty than kosher and much less salty than table salt. Hope these suggestions help someone.

I made the rub with a pork tenderloin and served with a pomegranate glaze for a dinner party. Everyone LOVED it! It has a very holidayish feel to it, and looked beautiful on the holiday plate with the broccoli recipe suggested, braised onions, and potatoes. YUM. It was tasty the following day as well. I seared the tenderloin and finished it in the oven. I would definitely make this again for entertaining.

We enjoyed this very much. There was much debate about whether to cook covered or uncovered. In the end we went with uncovered and only cooked it for about 3.5 hours. The meat was tasty, but the coating/onions a little salty. Next time I will half the salt. One hates to waste good drippings so I added a little wine, chicken stock and corn starch for a delicious sauce. We also made the Broccoli-Pecorino Gratinata recommended in the Roman menu. It was a great compliment. That with mock mashed potatoes made a great Atkins/Sugar busters friendly meal that can be done mostly ahead.

The pork was OK but I wouldn't make it again. I liked the spice rub but I had expected the meat to be significantly more tender than it was. The onions left in the pan were completely burnt; those piled on the pork were quite tasty. The only smell I noticed while it was cooking were onions -- no meat aroma in my house.

It was ok. I'd give it a 2.5. The onions were overdone - so they could have gone in raw and been better. The flavor was good on the rub. It did smell great while cooking.
