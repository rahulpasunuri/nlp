I parboiled the pearl onions as advised, a very good suggestion. Otherwise, I made this recipe as written. It was just okay.

I make this every year without fail at either Thanksgiving or Christmas. It has never failed to please everyone who are often surprised that it is soooo much better than any other creamed onion recipe they have ever had. The simplicity of this dish and the ingredients is part of what makes it so good. You cannot fail with this.

I only give 4 stars to knee buckling dishes. I would give it 3 1/2 if I could. I loved that it was really simple to make and and looks like you put in alot of work. I altered the recipe a bit. I sauted the garlic in the butter first them removed (to add later) then added in onion mixture and cooked until tender. I added in 3/4 cup white wine to try and cut the richness with a bit of acid. I also added in 3/4 cup goat cheese, sage, salt, pepper and thyme along with the called for cream. The breadcrumbs add that last finishing touch for the texture.

a 'like' recipe first appeared in Gourmet November 1985. I was hoping to find that original recipe which I have used every Thanksgiving and/or Christmas

I made this for my family's Christmas dinner the first time it appeared in print. Even the picky eaters and vegetable haters love it! It is no longer officially Christmas dinner unless I make this. Out of the last dozen-plus Christmases, I've only missed making this a handful of times. The prep and shopping are a labor of love. I agree with other reviewers: parboil and peel pearl onions yourself. The recipe has never worked with frozen or canned onions. I try to get white, yellow and purple pearl onions to add some visual "oomph" to the dish.

Apparently, this was outstanding. I made it for Thanksgiving, and my family emptied the dish before it got to me! There was a ton of food, so I saw it as a reflection of their appreciation for this particular recipe. Anyhow, I at least got to taste it while preparing it the day before. I used fresh pearl onions, blanched and peeled them, then cooked them along with all the others.

I thought that this recipe was good, but it didn't quite do it for me. My Dad loved it, though. I think that it would compliment mashed potatoes very well. Some people suggested that the baby pearl onions ruined the dish. I wouldn't worry about that--I thought that they provided a great contrast in texture.

Great addition to Turkey Day! Caramelize the onions and shallots for a rich delicious flavor. Skip the baby onions -- they ruin the dish. Use French's Fried Onions instead of breadcrumbs!

A little goes a long way. It's VERY rich. If I make this again I will use it to "accent" the meal rather than use it for a full-blown side dish. Although it wasn't my favorite I did catch my house guest eating it cold out of the fridge the next day.

I have been making this since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. A true delight.

Definitely a standard on our Thanksgiving dinner menu - opittle rich to make/eat more than once a year- but oh so good. The beauty is that it is so good made a head and pop in the oven when the turkey is done - makes Thanksgiving prep a breeze

This has been at every thanksgiving and christmas since 1991. We have substituted fresh boiling onions for the frozen and it's only gotten better.

Have been making this since its appearance in your magazine. A Thanksgiving tradition in our house and requested by my sisters if we go there for the holidays. I use drained jarred baby onions and add them late instead of frozen. One of only a handful of four fork ratings that I have given.

In Canada, I could not readily find the frozen baby onions, so I boiled raw baby onions in their skins for three minutes,then cooled them in cold water, cut off the stem end and squeezed out the onion! Seemed to work ok. Will advise how our crowd in Kelowna, B.C. rated this dish.

I have been making the Four Onion Gratin every Christmas for six or seven years. My sister-in-law says it's her favorite part of Christmas dinner. Always a huge favorite, easy to make...especially since it can be made one to two days ahead.

This dish was a hit our Thansgiving dinner this year. I added some garlic and asiago cheese to it. Definetly a good addition. Wil make it again.

This gratin has been on our Thanksgiving table every year since it first appeared in the magazine. I think there would be a riot in my house if I ever decided to leave it off the menu!! I ALWAYS make it a day ahead, and it is wonderful every time.

I made this dish to accompany a ham for an impromtu Christmas celebration. Needless to say, it went over extremely well. Lovely flavor and very simple to make. I have added this to my list of Holiday dishes.

I have been making this dish since it's debut years ago, was happy to see it online! There is no way I could ever eat or make the standard creamed onions. I add frozen artichokes and a little thyme and top with romano cheese with the bread crumbs.

Excellent! Very rich side dish! Made for Thanksgiving and was a hit - - would definitely make this dish again. Even added a bit of freshly grated nutmeg to the onions while simmering for 20 minutes. Excellent! Will definitely add this recipe to my list of favs.

Great dish, easy to make, and went over well with young and old alike! I made it in October and the family is begging for it at Thanksgiving.

I have made this recipe many times, it's easy and delicious, and now when I was preparing for Thanksgiving I was unable to find my copy. THANK YOU for this great site!

Made this for Thanksgiving. Turned out great and received lots of praise. I added sherry to the cream sauce and a bit of freshly grated nutmeg. I also increased the amount of breadcrumbs for the topping. The leeks add such wonderful flavor & texture to the dish. I'll never make plain creamed onions again.

I have made this numerous times and always get rave reviews. I add grated imported Parmesan with the breadcrumbs - then bake it. It is better with a healthy dose of freshly ground white pepper added to the onions. I think this originally appeared in either Gourmet or Bon Appetit in the early 1980s. Very tasty!
