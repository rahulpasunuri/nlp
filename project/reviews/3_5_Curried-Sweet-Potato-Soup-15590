Like these very clever cooks before me I took their advice, sauté onions, and garlic, and very important quickly sauté curry pwd. Till fragrant. Add 4 cups of chicken broth, and 4 huge sweet potatoes and big nob of grated fresh ginger.. Blended it smooth when cooked thru. Then added coconut milk. Awesome. Thx. For all the tips. We loved the spiceness. Maybe will try a bit of nutmeg. Used fab. HOT Curry Rajah from South Africa

Easy to vegan-ize! Lite coconut milk was perfect. Onion and garlic were vital, and plenty of curry powder. I recommend some fresh ginger too, a couple of tablespoons.

I tried this recipe with leftover mashed sweet potatoes seasoned with kosher salt and course ground black pepper. started off heating up a little olive oil and throwing in a bit of fresh chopped ginger before pouring the broth into the saucepan. Went well with curry flavor - gave it an unexpected kick. Husband give it two thumps up.

excellent! We added a little more curry than what was listed in the recipe (more like 3 teaspoons) Also we added minced garlic in oil (the kind you buy in a plastic jar) It was super delicious! Thanks

I used mild curry powder and add about 3 times what they suggested. I also added cumin and garlic and onion during the blending stage. And instead of milk, I used coconut milk. It turned out very creamy and not spicy at all. Next time I make it, I'll use medium curry powder. VERY GOOD!

So easy and tastes amazing! I did sauté some onions as suggested. (Subtle but great addition.) I subbed light coconut milk. WOW. Also used yams and sweet potatoes...came out great! Maybe it was the changes I made, but the soup was not thick enough to 'hold' the yogurt dollop at the end. No matter, this was so good; I'm still giving it 4 forks. I served with sesame and almond jasmine rice.

I will definitely make it again and also tell friends about it. I added the onions and the garlic though... And I used buttermilk (actually mixed yogurt and water to make it like buttermilk consistency) instead of milk. I am sure it gave a better taste than just milk... Delicious!!! Bon Appetit!

This turned out very well for such a simple recipe - it has a lot of flavor and a nice velvety texture. Next time, I will start by sauteeing some onion and a little garlic, and then proceed with the recipe as directed. I also puree the soup using an immersion blender.

After reading through the reviews, I started the soup by sauteeing some onion and 2 cloves of garlic minced, then added veggie broth from cubes, and added the sweet potatoes. With the Curry plus some cumin, this is spiced perfectly for my family. And then I use the immersion blender to puree the entire soup - love it.

For such a simple, quick recipe, this soup was incredibly tasty. I used some good quality curry powder from India, and added a tablespoon of powdered coconut for some extra flavour. I'll be making this again.

This was really good but I felt like it was missing something. Next time I'll try to add in some nutmeg or a little brown sugar.

Absolutely delicious! We had Charlie Trotter's version of this last week, and thought it was awesome, so looked up this recipe and it's just as amazing! I added a little red pepper chili flakes to give it a little more kick, and my own version of veggie broth, not the roasted vegetable broth listed. Worked really well. Made a triple batch, it was so delicious. Will try freezing it, and definitely will be a go-to recipe in the future. Tasty AND easy!

I made this soup after thanksgiving. I had lots of turkey stock and 4 cups of, already mashed, sweet potatoes. I apparently did not read the recipe acurately and put the 4 cups of broth with the sweet potatoes in the food processors. But I added 1/2 a cup of cream and an extra tablespoon of curry and it turned out wonderfully. I would make it "my way" again and again and again. My family can't get enough of it.

I made this receipe this afternoon as I had some yams that needed to be used up. I followed the recipe...for the most part. I added only 1/2 tsp curry, along with 1/2 tsp cumin and a 1/2 tsp ginger. In lieu of the milk, I used a cup of sweetened condensed milk - don't ask me why, I had it on hand and was looking to get rid of it. Perhaps it was another reviewer's substitution of coconut milk that inspired me. Regardless, the soup came out quite well. The smell, while cooking, was driving my fiancee nuts while he was working on the house.

Very good and remarkably easy. I sauteed an onion to start the soup, then added the sweet potatoes. It freezes great too (without the yogurt)

After reading the reviews, I made this last night with the following revisions: I subsituted 1 can of coconut milk, used 1 tablespoon of curry, teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and seasoning salt (instead of regular). Also I used 2 cans of low sodium chicken both (equivalent to 2 1/2 cups) and 1/2 cup of water instead of the vegetable broth (only because it was what I had on hand). Both my boyfriend and I loved this dish!!!!! It was mildly spicy (but you could always amp this up if you want more kick)but definitely flavorful and tasty. The yougurt and chives definitely added a special touch and it made our rainy night much warmer. This will definitely be a keeper.

Very easy and delicious. I sauteed some onions and garlic in a little oil, added extra curry as well as cinnamon, turmeric, and red pepper. It came out great with many different notes of spiciness (but not too spicy!).

Great! Will definitely make again. My HUSBAND actually made this (he generally does not cook anything!) when I was late getting home one night. He made it exactly as written except he used chicken stock and toasted the curry powder (as per my instruction) for enhanced flavor. Looking forward to the next time!

This is great-- definitely substitute chicken broth for veggie broth, or else the soup is too bland. 1% milk works nicely. I also used garam masala instead of curry powder and liked the extra zing.

This soup was divine! I had to make a few changes, didn't have enough yams so threw in a couple carrots. Love spicy, so added about 1 tsp dried ginger, cumin, and dash of turmeric with 2 tsp curry powder. Used evaporated milk and it was delicious and creamy.

This is fantastic, easy, and healthy. I saute an onion and garlic, then add chicken broth and the sweet potatoes. I up the spices to 1 T curry and 1 t cumin. An immersion blender makes this a breeze! I also add half cup light coconut milk and half cup non-fat milk. My entire family loves it.

This soup is delicious. As suggested, I added onion and garlic while the potatoes were boiling. I only had sweet potatoes and soy milk, not yams or regular milk, I don't know if that made a difference. The soy milk has a tendancy to curdle so I mixed the soup in the cup beforehand to prevent that and it seemed to work. I would definately make this again.

How easy was this? Made this on a rainy Tuesday evening for my husband and I....changed it up a bit just to use what I had in my pantry...chicken broth instead of vege broth, Hot Madras Curry (a bit more than stated because we like it hot), 1 small onion, and 2 cloves of minced garlic boiled with the broth. Instead of yogurt, used swirl of cream and fresh chives. The house smelled good enough to eat, the soup was incredible (also served it with some baguette and a soft cheese from a local boutique dairy farm. Hubby loved it so much, he decided to eat some for breakfast this morning!!!

Very impressive! I fully wasn't expecting it to turn out this delicious. I made the recipe as written, simply because my friend who also makes it insisted. Practically no work and the result is unbelievably complex in flavor and gorgeous on top. Although I do admit - I took the time to make the roasted veggie stock, which I think was worth it; it smelled delicious all by itself. Will certainly try some of the suggestions next.

This is a classic in winter in the mediterranean - BUT - we turn it into a root soup (at least in Israe). A vital twist to the Old City cook way: add a few JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES!!. Then with this basis you can add regular potatoes, parsnips, even carrots as you wish! It becomes a very powerful dish. Cheers.

I started with an onion sauteed with garlic, ginger, and ground red pepper. Added a granny smith apple with the sweet potatoes and used half veggie broth and half chicken broth. I skipped the yogurt and chives and didn't miss them. It was delicious and very easy to prepare.

I loved the Old City cook's review so much, I had to try this - you made me laugh! Anyway, I didn't really make the recipe as written, but used a combo of all the other suggestions. It was FANTASTIC! I sauted a small white onion with a granny smith apple. Then added curry powder, a dash of cinnamon, 2 whole cloves, celery salt. Added chicken broth, canned pumpkin, and coconut milk. Simmered until ready to eat. I had spiced it quite a bit and didn't feel the need for nutmeg or the chili flakes. Wow - easy and amazingly good! Will make again!

Made this soup tonight for my husband, inorporating some of the extras from the reviews below such as dried chili flakes, fresh ginger, a gala apple, and lots of madras curry! The result - a very spicy soup that was perfect for us as we've missed some of the richer, spicier flavors from the States! Definitely will make this again!

I added to the extensive modifications of this recipe suggested by the rather modest Old City Philadelphia chef. I used chicken broth (2 cans each of plain broth and roasted veggie broth), and added an apple with the sweet potoato and parsnip. Also I added some tart Alsacian wine to give it some acidity. This soup was WONDERFUL, given rave reviews by my guests. A definite keeper!

This is for the cook from Old City. Your advice is almost a different recipe but it was outstanding! Thank you! A great hit at my daughter's 20th birthday dinner. In the absence of parsnips 2-3 potatoes were tossed in and cumin instead of curry powder. The coconut milk was brilliant and had the added benefit of milky texture for those who avoid milk preoducts or choose not to mix meat and dairy. Highly recommended.

I used garam masala instead of curry powder, substituted 1 cup of liquid from canned pineapples (in their own juice) for 1 cup of veggie broth; added 3 TBS red lentils to simmer after blending and sprinkled with scallions and black sesame seeds before serving. Even the family "gourmet" loved it.

I made this with chicken broth and coconut milk and served with roasted cauliflower on the side. The next night, I added the leftover cauliflower to the soup - delicious! I especially recommend the combination, though the plain soup was decent. I agree with the Saskatoon reviewer that the chives make a big difference.

This dish is extraordinary not just for its wonderful flavor but for how incredibly easy it is to make! A great fall-back dish for a fall evening when you're not up to cooking. Tasty, nutritious, easy--what's not to like?

This dish was very bland. I ended up adding more curry, but that through off the dish entirely. Then I added more salt and pepper which improved things greatly, but I would not recommend this dish.

I also used chicken broth, and I also used canned un-sweetened coconut milk instead of the low fat milk suggested in the recipe. Warm and creamy on a cold night, with just a touch of spice. Quite satisfying, and so easy.

For pure simplicity and depth of taste, this is one of the best soup recipes I've found. I too used chicken broth to much success. I also used hot madras curry powder which gave it some kick.

Wonderful flavor. It tastes so gourmet and is yet so simple. To save time I just used canned chicken broth and it turned out delicious. It was also great before I added the milk, which just made it a little creamier, so I think the milk could easily be omitted for the lactose intolerant or vegan.

hi: i was thinking of making a soup tonight that was healthy and alluring. the only thing that turns me off the teeniest bit about this recipe, is that i'd ideally prefer something dairy-free since it's cold which means mucus season. any dairy-free sumptuous soup recipes to suggest? perhaps i can dig something up from my archives. but perhaps i should be more flex and try this baby out and let you know. i do love yoghurt. later, N
