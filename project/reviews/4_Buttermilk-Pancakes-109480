Perfect pancakes! This moves up to standard recipe status. So easy to remember too.

No need to buy special mixes anymore. These pancakes were super easy and delicious. They turned out very light and fluffy. I made them pretty as written, except I added a pinch of sugar and more buttermilk to thin out the batter somewhat for pourability. Perfect use for leftover buttermilk.

Delicious pancakes, but the batter doesn't keep for 3 days. Mine was mouldy after 2 days.

The best pancakes I've ever been able to make. Even the first few I made were great - and I usually ruin those. They fluff up very nicely, too. I've made them twice and this will be my go-to pancake recipe from now on.

Rating: 0
Great jumping off point. I made this recipe twice. Initially I followed the recipe exactly. It produced a more dense pancake, great if you're topping with fruit or something similar. The second time I added an additional Tbsp. of buttermilk, I also separated the egg, whipped the white and folded it in just prior to cooking. This made a fluffier more box-mix type pancake. I don't really understand some of the negative comments. Pancakes are awfully subjective and different types are better for different tastes and occasions. The great thing about pancakes is that they are very easy to eyeball and improvise. That's most of the fun!

Rating: 4
These are excellent and easy to make. The buttermilk makes them much more flavorful than your regular pancake, and they taste wonderful when combined with sour cream, scallions, and caviar as in the caviar pancakes mentioned above.

This recipe is wonderful! I was out of buttermilk so I used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice with enough milk to make it one cup. I also added about two teaspoons of cinnamon and 6 teaspoons of sugar. I also only poured out one tablespoon of batter at a time to make silver dollar pancakes. They were delicious and snack-sized.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I was pleasantly surprised that they were light and fluffy. I have to say I was a bit scared at how thick the batter was. So I made three pancakes with the batter as is and they were fluffy and tasty, but didn't cook evenly. So I added two tablespoons of buttermilk to thin the bater a bit. The second batch were perfect. The next time I make these I will decrease the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. I like this recipe because it's quick and doesn't call for whipping egg whites and it uses up leftover buttermilk that always goes to waste because we make lots of cupcakes in this house.

These were outstanding. They rival my favorite sweet cream pancakes from Black Bear Diner. This will be my go-to recipe for buttermilk pancakes.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a great basic recipe. I guess because I always change recipes it didn't seem that big of deal to add flavors and more milk. I added tablespoon of sugar, teaspoon of vanilla and a little more buttermilk to thin the batter out. Plus I waited for a few minutes before I laddled it onto the griddle to allow the gluten to rest. The pancakes had a light cripy outside and were fluffy inside. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

This is an excellent recipe. It tastes great and produces a light and tasty pancake. The proportions are perfect. The author used 1 t of soda which is the correct amount with all that buttermilk. I always make a double batch.

Very easy and basic recipe. I gave it four stars because it has that potential, but not as written, IMHO. The batter is much too thick, so I thinned it with water. I added some vanilla and sugar for flavor - lemon zest would be a nice addition. Next time I'll use only 1/2 t. baking soda. I think another egg might improve it as well. It needs tweaking, but it's a good basic recipe and a good way to use up leftover buttermilk.

Great recipe. I tweaked it with a pinch of sugar, 1/2 tsp. of vanilla,and coarsely-chopped blackberries to boost flavor, and a splash more of buttermilk to thin the batter so the cakes would cook more evenly. Served with maple syrup. Great New Year's Day breakfast!

I tried this recipe and followed the instructions completely. I gave it two forks only because it was seriously lacking in taste. Yes, I know it's basic buttermilk pancakes, but I've tasted better. Usually I can have the pancake all by itself and enjoy the buttermilk flavor but was disappointed. The recipe is easy to make, the texture was great, and it was fluffy and cute, but I need something a little more richer in natural flavor. Yes I can add fruit or pure maple syrup, but the pancake should be also great on its own. Everything else is just a compliment. I'm looking to improve the batter so I can use the rest of it.

Rating: 4
These pancakes turned out beautifully. They were perfect and fluffy and delicious. I don't know what the heck some of these other folks are complaining about--If you follow the recipe and don't mess around with it, the batter is not too thick. Also, come on, they're buttermilk pancakes. Of course they're going to be bland without anything on them; that's the point. New viewers, pay no mind to the haters, this recipe is solid gold.

Rating: 4
This recipe is beautifully simplistic. It makes a light, fluffy pancake that cooks easily. Some reviewers have said that it is bland, but I think that's sort of the point - it's ready for all kinds of additions, toppings, etc. One easy suggestion is to slice some tart apples and cook them with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a little lemon juice. Makes a delicious topping. Yum!

Had leftover buttermilk from a 4 forker made yesterday. These were simple to make using ingredients I had on hand. My guests raved about them. I may never buy boxed pancake mix again! (p.s. try this for a topping. Slice firm bananas into 1/3" slices. Fry in 2 ozs. butter for about a min. each side or until browned. Put on top of pancakes, hot syrup over all. Yummy!)

These were absolutely perfect buttermilk pancake recipes. The reviewers who say these are bland are crazy or have weird expectations of buttermilk pancakes. They are supposed to taste like pancakes, not vanilla or lemon zest or brown sugar. If you want flavored pancakes search for a flavored pancake recipe and don't knock a recipe because it obviously doesn't meet your initial needs.

Good fluffy pancakes. For only 1 cup of flour and 1 egg, it makes quite a bit. I added 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I whipped up the egg white before putting it into the batter. If you need to use up your buttermilk, this is a good recipe to try.

These pancakes turned out flat. The proportion of wet and dry ingredients is off, making for a thin batter. The chemistry between the acidic buttermilk and the baking soda is not enough to overcome this flaw. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and some freshly grated nutmeg, so the flavor was ok. I would not make this recipe again.

I've been making these pancakes and only these pancakes since discovering the recipe a little over a year ago. They are perfection. I saw that the four star rating had dropped and felt the need to bolster it back up again. I wish that people who aren't sure of the freshness of their ingredients would wait to review until they know what they are doing with a recipe. I rely very much on the forks in choosing what to make on epicurious, and I'd hate to think I'd have missed out on this recipe...

Since most of put some sort of topping-maple syrup or fruit-on our pancakes, there is no need to make the pancake itself sweet. These are just perfect, simple pancakes. I use powdered buttermilk, which saves me from having a quart of useless stuff in my fridge.

Wow, this pancake is the best! Fluffy, soft, and flavorful. My husband and I don't think we can go back to other recipe. I made minor changes, reduced salt to 1/4 or 1/8, used unsalted butter for pan, made two big pancake with half inch thickness. We had it as breakfast with bacon. Accompanying warm maple syrup with organic strawberry and blueberry (you can microwave each frozen berry with maple in this season).

I made these pancakes per the recipe. They are beautiful and have great texture but the flavor is bland. I think it makes a nice base recipe but definitely needs some additions...sugar, vanilla and maybe fruit or nuts. I would make again but only with additions.

I had some leftover buttermilk from making red velvet cupcakes so I used some up to make pancakes. Normally I screw pancakes up and they don't cook through. But this worked perfectly! I read the reviews beforehand and like others suggested used brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. They still weren't very flavorful as I didn't have any frozen fruit to mix in nor a lemon to zest for the batter. But it was good with syrup and super easy. I'll definitely make again and use this as a standard base for future pancakes.

I read all the reviews first, thought, and asses a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested to tone down the sourness. I loved these and they're the perfect way to finish off the buttermilk I always have left over from other recipes! (I added wild raspberries, too! Whoohoo!)

These were easy and they certainly looked beautiful, like the platonic pancake ideal, however, they didn't taste all that great. They had a slightly doughy, baking powdery taste. I can see them going better with caviar than butter and maple syrup. I might make them again if I were feeling lazy, but they weren't the best.

This recipe was disappointing. I made them with blueberries and served with maple syrup but they still tasted completely bland. They absolutely need to have sugar added. Also, they took longer to cook than any pancakes I've ever made - the only way I could get the insides to cook completely was by putting them in the oven at 200 for 15 minutes after frying. Recipe makes about 5 large pancakes. I'd only try this again with significant changes made.

I have used this recipe for years. My absolute hands down favorite for fluffy, delicious pancakes. However, now think the salt is unnecessary. Also, I have made whole wheat pancakes using 3/4 whole wheat to 1/4 all purpose flour and they were fabulous. Remember to stir only until dry ingredients are combined w/ wet. Most importantly, don't forget to let the batter rest for 15 minutes before using to hydrate the dry ingredients.

This came out perfect. I used skim milk with lemon juice instead of the buttermilk and added 2 T. of sugar as recommended.

Wow! Light, fluffy pancakes. I was in the mood to have pancakes for dinner (I rarely eat breakfast) so I found this recipe and adapted it. Here's how to make it easier and yummier: Place all ingredients except flour in the blender. Add the finely grated rind of 1 lemon + 2 T. sugar. Now add the flour. Blend briefly, pulsing 3-4 times until mixture looks like pancake batter. Now you can use the blender pitcher to pour the pancake batter onte the griddle. All you will need to clean up afterward is the pitcher, the griddle and the spatula!

This is the only decent recipe for pancakes I've ever tried, yet it's a recipe so easy even my boyfriend could make it. If you use milk instead of buttermilk, you should use an acid like lemon juice or vinegar to make it more acid so it will react with the baking soda. However, I still think buttermilk does the best job. I stirred in a spoonful of sour cream into the buttermilk for extra thick, fluffy if ugly pancakes that took longer to cook. This is one of my favorite recipes on epicurious so far.

A good, solid, basic recipe. I hardly ever make pancakes, and discovered two important things to making these come out fluffy and evenly brown: (1) make sure the griddle is totally preheated before starting (make a sacrificial pancake first; if the griddle isn't ready, it will be by the time the first anemic, slightly flat one is done) (2) if you use a good nonstick pan, you don't really need to grease it at all. (butter can make them brown unevenly) I'm also convinced that getting "professionally" tall fluffy pancakes involves a bit of a cheat: after you pour in a round of pancakes, go back and add a little more on top; the bottom part will be set just enough that the extra batter will not simply make the whole thing spread---voila, a taller, not bigger, pancake) These hints are no doubt obvious to veteran pancake-makers, but I add them here since I imagine many (like me) who are searching epicurious for a pancake recipe aren't exactly in the habit of making pancakes. (Maybe I will be now!)

For the simplicity of ingredients and the fact that it makes a perfect amount of batter for 2 people... yummmmmm.

Great pancake recipe! Simple and good. I didn't have quite enough buttermilk so I supplemented with whole milk and lemon juice for the acid.

in response to the cook who made the recipe with milk (not buttermilk) and found it tough...it's the acid in the buttermilk mixed with the baking soda that creates a tender pancake...you can "clabber" sweet milk by mixing some vinegar in with it and letting it stand for a few minutes (I always check my Joy of Cooking cookbook for measurements when I don't happen to have buttermilk on hand).

I used 2% milk since I had no buttermilk and these came out a little tough. Maybe I should have added a tablespoon or two of fat to soften it up? I also added pumpkin pie spice since I had no fruit to add, and it didn't help the flavor. I think someone suggested using 1/2t baking soda, 1/2t baking powder. That was probably a good idea, because I wasn't crazy about this one.

These are delicious, fool-proof pancakes. They came out looking perfect and were a real hit.

I used half and half since I didn't have buttermilk. I also added 1 zest of lime and 1/2 an apple. I just used what I had and it was great! I was inspired by another recipe that actually called for lemon zest.

Great pancake recipe. I always wanted to make perfect pancakes I tasted in holidays in the States, but it was not easy. But now I found it! Thank you epicurious!

Added lemon extract, 3tbs. sugar and some blueberries for a very quick, easy and delicious breakfast. With such a simple base, the possibilities seem endless. Definitely a keeper.

Terrific recipe - easy, tasty result and quick. I've been looking for a good basic American pancake recipe for ages and this one fits the bill. I used buttermilk powder and water as I didn't have any buttermilk when I decided to make pancakes, and the result was perfect: great consistency, lovely taste, excellent texture. I doubled the recipe to feed my family of five.

A very good basic pankcake that's superquick. I used cake flour because I was out of regular flour, and they came out extra fluffy. Halving the recipe makes 6 pancakes and worked great. Will definitely make again.

The Platonic ideal of pancakes. I did find the batter thicker than I was expecting but I didn't alter it and was rewarded with pancakes that rose beautifully in the pan. If you prefer a thinner pancake, by all means change the ratio. This is the perfect starting point, though.

What a great recipe! This was so easy and quick to make. My husband could taste the baking soda in it, so I'll modify the recipe to 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I'll also try one of the previous reviewer's hints about adding a touch of maple syrup.

This recipe is really perfect for busy people, especially ones with toddlers. I make two or three batches at once, then freeze the rest for weekday breakfasts. While simple, this basic recipe will lend itself to lots of variations - include spices, vanilla, dried or fresh fruits easily. But, they're also very good just as written.

Very tasty and SO easy -- just about as easy as box mix, in fact! I also found the batter to be a bit too thick, so I upped the buttermilk and that did the trick. I also added a glug of real maple syrup to balance the tang of the buttermilk. This is my new standard pancake recipe!

Very yummy, had to add just a couple of TB of water because it was thick but a very good pancake!

These were moist and fluffy, but seemed to lack flavor---if you're looking for a no-fat recipe, it's okay. My standard recipe mimics this, but includes 1-2 Tbsp canola oil and 1 Tbsp of sugar---more taste, but more fat.

Very tasty and moist! I added a little sugar to the pancakes also to balance the buttermilk and salt.

So moist and fluffy. My 4 year old made these and ate more than usual.

Fabulous and easy! The first batch went so quickly I had to make a second one. No more boxed mix for this family.

Best pancake recipe I've ever tried. It's stupid to use box mix when you can do this so easily and inexpensively

Remarkably easy, I used whole milk in place of the butter milk and added a tablespoon of melted margarine to the mix - scrumptious.

I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used regular milk. I am sure this affected the consistency, but they were still pretty good. I also added blueberries to spice them up. I would try them again, but follow the recipe more carefully.

Good, serviceable (and relatively low-fat) pancake batter. I was making these for breakfast, so I stirred in about 1/3 c. sugar and about 2 c. blueberries. I spread the batter a bit after pouring it on the griddle so the cakes would cook all the way through.
