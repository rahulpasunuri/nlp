This is a very good recipe. Use your own judgement with the ingredients; I use a bit more wine (use good wine) and a bit more mushrooms. Try other types of mushrooms for a totally differnt flavor. Also great using chicken that is pounded thin. I have served the recipe for many years and know it by heart. Everybody who I have cooked this for raves about it- even a ten year old neighbor of my daughter who doesn't like ANYTHING but askes for me to cook this every time she comes over.

I added sage and thyme, as this seemed lacking in herbs. The sauce was flavourful and complex, but served over the veal, it somehow lost something. I think I might try this again, searing the veal and finishing it with the sauce in the pan.

This was an excellent dish, although I would cut some of the cream next time. I added dried thyme to the porcini broth, and then sage to the fresh mushrooms. I think those extra spices added a lot to the dish.

This dish was very easy to make and not too labor intensive considering how doggone good it is. I deglazed the pan after browning the veal and added that to the mushroom sauce. Spouse loved it!

This recipe was difficult to make considering the end result. There are many other easier veal recipes to make!

Thought this was geat. Did not find dried morels in my grocery store so I used an assorted pkg. of dries wild mushrooms instead. Also used oysters and crimini fresh. My youngest-age 6- had thirds of the sauce and all suggested it go in our favourite recipe book to make again!

I have made this twice. The first time I used the dried morels. The next time however, I substituted fresh portabellas for them and I think the flavor was actually better. I added a touch of garlic and lightly sprinkled each serving dish with parmesan cheese. With the minor modificatios it was a splendid dish.

My husband and both liked this recipe, however it is VERY expensive. I halved it for 2 but you still have to buy 1/2oz. packages of dried mushrooms. The mushroom sauce was very good, but I've had better. I substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream. Don't skimp on the shallots they give it the flavor.

Lacked any "killer" effect. Definitely not worth the cost of the mushrooms.
