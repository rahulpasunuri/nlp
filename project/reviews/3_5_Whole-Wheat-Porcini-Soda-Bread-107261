Smells and tastes very earthy. It would be a great accompaniment to soup, but is a little strong on its own.

This was the easiest bread I have ever made. I made it exactly as printed for a St. Patrick's day dinner and received lots of compliments-it was eaten so it must have been good. I will make again throughout the year

I made this bread for my annual New Year's Dinner which had an Italian theme. I made it with figs and it was really delicious and so simple - smelled amazing while baking. I would make this again in a heartbeat!

Here is the missing remainder of recipe: Whisk both flours, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in another large bowl. Make well in center; add oat mixture and stir until dough forms, gradually mixing in dry ingredients. Turn dough out onto work surface and knead gently, about 5 turns. Shape dough into 7 inch round. Transfer to baking sheet. Cut an X in top center of loaf. Brush with egg glaze. Bake bread until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 65 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap bread tightly in foil and let stand at room temperature.) * Available at Italian markets, specialty food stores, and some supermarkets. ** Available at natural food stores and some specialty food stores.

Excellent! I am not a bread maker, but this may have changed my mind. I skipped the mushrooms and just added 1 cup of chopped, mixed fruit. Used Maple Syrup instead of honey and skipped the egg wash. Half of the directions are missing. I sifted the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, let it stand about an hour, then put it all into a large loaf pan and baked it for about 45 mins at 375. I made it last night and it's almost all gone between the two of us.

I hope that Epicurious reprints the whole recipe here. This is very good and easy to make. It would also be good with an assortment of dried fruits in place of the porcini and apricots. Next time I will only use 1 t. salt, as it was too prominent for my taste. I made two smaller loaves and baked them about 40 minutes. Freezes very well, too.
