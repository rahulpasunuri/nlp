This cake was delicious and easy to prepare. I tried it for the first time at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used the extra toffee sauce over ice cream a few days later. Definitely worth repeating.

Great cake. Great flavor.

Just a note...pudding is an informal synonym for the dessert course in England. It does not restrict itself to the USA idea of a soft, milk based product, but can include a variety of desserts, including cakes.

Yummy toffee!!! It's really mouth-watering. Ill be making this for my family and Im sure theyll love this like the recipes on www.bananapedia.com that I made for them

Eh, ok. It's better than the other recipe I had for this but both are bland and the only thing that saved this - ONCE AGAIN - is the toffee. So, I decided to use cake flour to make it more moist - not like it really mattered. It was more of a dry, bland flavor. For the toffee, I didn't have corn syrup, so I used honey instead and it did smell good - like buttered caramel popcorn.. mmm. The only reason why I keep making this crappy dish is because my fiance likes it.

I am not a big dessert cook, and that's exactly why I chose this recipe. It was easy, not time consuming, and can be done ahead of time. Best of all, was that it was delicious. I took it for Easter brunch, and everyone loved it!

I love this recipe! It's perfect. I made it for the cafe where I work, & drooled the whole while. & now I'll be making it at home. In fact, I think it will be the birthday cake of the year. I substituted Marsala wine for the rum. & I didn't have corn syrup on hand for the toffee so I used fake maple syrup instead, which is basically just corn syrup anyway. I really enjoyed how subtle the banana flavor was. Very well balanced taste wise.

The toffee is absolutely wonderful. I would make it to put on ice cream with some toasted nuts. I liked the pudding --my husband thought it was wonderful, but I found it awefully sweet.

Great easy moist cake! Tasted like bread pudding made with banana bread. As a Kentucky girl, I added bourbon to both sauce and batter. Yum!

My oh my, this is my new fav! I was attracted to this "cake" (more of a cake than a pudding--I realize that the Brits may call this pudding, but for those who are unfamiliar, pudding is a rather misleading term, but I digress...) because it makes a small 8x8 cake which is nice for entertaining so there's not so many leftovers to be tempted by. I followed the recipe except I only had light brown sugar and not dark, but I don't feel like it made a huge difference. My husband said serving the toffee sauce with it was overkill, but I disagree. I loved the sweet/salty notes of the toffee sauce and as a previous reviewer suggested I served it with a dollop of very lightly sweetened whipped cream. Decadent but worth every calorie!

Who could resist that picture? I couldn't and I'm glad, as this was fabulous! No, it is not a custardy pudding, but the British call any dessert "pudding" or "pud" for short, and the original sticky toffee pudding is a cake as well, albeit steamed. Plan to make this one again. Yummy!

Others have mentioned that this is not really pudding, which is true. Sticky Toffee Pudding is a British dessert and it is meant to be more like a very moist warm cake with melted toffee poured over rather than a regular pudding. I cheated a bit with the recipe. I had a jar of caramel au beurre salé from Brittany that has been in my cabinet for ages, so I decided to use it instead of making the toffee. The result was delicious. The addition of the banana worked really well.

Very tender cake--not so much of a pudding but a delicious combination with the toffee. Substituted 1/4 cup of oil for butter; used three bananas and light brown sugar instead of dark. Will try the same cake batter for cupcakes.

Made exactly per recipe. Served to a neighborhood group, and got one strong adherent. Found it to be less a pudding and more a cake, and not as sweet as it looks on the picture. It made a beautiful presentation. Doubt if would make again. HSV Cook

This was absolutely delicious. Unlike other reviewers, my cake had a cake- like texture- not a loaf or quick bread density. Really good. I followed the recipe as stated and it all worked out!

I was a little disappointed with this as the cake is more like a 'loaf' being very dense. My toffee also didn't turn out, but that is likely due to the substitutions I made (50% milk, 50% cream, 1 TBsp butter instead of 4) rather than the recipe.

Made this cake for the office last night and made it pretty much as the recipe called for but when I added the caramel topping I also added pecans and then drizzled more caramel on top of the pecans. Got great reviews and served it with the extra caramel rewarmed and homemade whipped cream on the side.

Comfort food at its best, especially if served warm. The pan may seem small, but it is rich, so a large serving is not needed. Good vanilla ice cream adds a nice contrast of cold with the warm sauce and cake. I made it just as the recipe is written, although the sauce took longer to cook than stated, and I did not need to add any extra cream, it was still thin enough. I might try adding nutmeg next time.

Oh my gosh!! This was EXCELLENT! definitely serve it warm. Substituted cointreau for the rum (didn't have any in the house). It was still excellent. The only problem is that it makes such a small pan. I agree with the first reviewer, definitely more of a bread/cake. Not as dense as a bread pudding. Very rich. Looks just like the picture

Very good. Similar to banana bread. Might use a little less sugar next time. Had to sub. 1 cup half-n-half for heavy cream. Toffee topping was excellent. Might suggest some lightly sweetened whipped cream on top of toffee to help cut the sweetness!
