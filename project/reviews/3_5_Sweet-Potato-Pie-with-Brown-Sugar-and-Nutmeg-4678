very citrus-y tasting pie! a nice change, definitely not what i was expecting. I found the crust pretty easy to work, all crusts considered (I resist making them them but also feel like it's my foodie-duty to learn - so always looking for an easy one!) the filling was nice - really fresh tasting. i didn't have enough heavy cream, so i used a mix of it + 2% - took a bit longer to bake but turned out fine.

Easy to make and very tasty. Like other said, omit or cut down OJ (I used 1/4 cup) and I could still taste it.

The pie itself was good....but omit the orange juice in this case. I am not sure why the juice is added...but it works well with out it.

We have made this over and over since we first read it in Bon Apetit Magazine years ago.

omit the orange juice. add one teaspoon of lemon extract, it will taste so much better

This pie was awesomely delicious and it was not overly sweet. It was perfect! There wasn't a sliver left when my family got ahold of it after a full course dinner. That's got to tell you something.

This pie is sickeningly sweet. The two predominant flavors are of sugar and orange. I worried about the large amount of sugar when I first read the recipe but I thought the orange would add an interesting undercurrent. This was not a good combo for me. I won't make it again.

This pie is simple and a big hit. It has a number of nice flavors which work really well together. I have made it twice with great success.

actually, i only used the recipe to make the crust -- which was excellent. i had never made a pie crust before and it turned out perfect.

This is a great pie. It could make a sweet potato lover out of anyone.
