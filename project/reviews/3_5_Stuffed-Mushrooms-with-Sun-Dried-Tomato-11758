Great recipe to work with. Like most readers, I didn't want an overpowering sun dried tomato flavor, but used the recipe for preparing the caps, allowing them to marinate and then bake in a mixture of sun dried tomato oil, balsamic vinegar and a bit of dry white wine. I also added my own spin to the stuffing with a bit of panko bread crumbs and additional veggies cut into tiny bits (zucchini and red bell pepper). The overall flavor was lovely, mild and quite pretty with all the colors in each mushroom cap. Sadly, I didn't get to taste one mushroom (though I did sample the stuffing). I gave five to my husband and the rest to my neighbors. All who sampled them pronounced them delicious! And everyone ate them cold.

Having too much fun in the kitchen (and attempting 2 different kinds of stuffed'shrooms simultaneously) led to a lapse in mental faculities - and adding Panko breadcrumbs to this. They still turned out GREAT! Next time I'll grate the parmesan fine tho - the baking sheet had more cheese on it than the mushroom! And there definitely will be a next time! Can hardly wait to use the leftover stuffing today on crustini!

Only make this recipe if you really, really LOVE sun-dried tomatoes ... and a lot of them. They tasted better when they were hot out of the oven, oddly enough.

Delicious! I prepared these for a New Year's Eve party. I received many compliments, and they were even better the next day. I incorporated the suggestions made by the Mt. Pleasant, SC reviewer. The addition of breadcrumbs, red wine and additional cream were helpful to nuetralize the powerful sundried tomato flavor. I will definitely make these again.

I made this recipe at the last minute for a Thanksgiving appetizer. I had bought more mushrooms than I needed, and had sun-dried tomatoes in the house along with the other ingredients. Every one of my guests raved about them, several asked for the recipe, and I was told this was now MY dish to bring for all the holidays. It was easy to prepare and tasted yummy. In fact, with as large as the mushrooms were, I could have served them with a salad and that would have been a meal.

I put the hearty white caps stemmed side down and they did not soften the least bit- even after repeated 2 minute broils. Finally put them stemmed side up and they softened after the 2 minute broil time. Juices pooled in caps so I added the juices to the pan with the tomato mixture for flavoring. I did what I could to approximate the recipe without trips to the store: I used 1/2 an onion instead of shallot, left out thyme (no shallot at home and too lazy to find the thyme) and added 3 large cloves of garlic instead of just onje teaspoon. No heavy cream so I added an egg white whisked with a bit of milk instead. Used parma as instructed. They came out great-- although a bit soft due to my first attempts to soften caps. Guests loved them!

Caution: mushrooms "weep". Added the extra liquid to skillet. Used Delallo 6.5 oz. S.D. tomatoes, 3 T parmesan, 2 T bread crumbs, and 4 T cream in mixture instead of amounts in recipe. Also used add'l parmesan on top after stuffing. Very happy with results and so were my guests. Also good cold if you have any left over.

These were yummy! Don't worry if they're sitting out for guests to munch and they get cold, cause they still taste great! Everyone liked them! I made them in the morning and baked them before serving and they held up very well.

this recipe was good, however, I added roasted pine nuts,italian flavored bread crumbs, and I also used baby portabellos. This would make a nice app.

I was a little skeptical about making these for my New Year's Eve party after reading the other reviews, but I decided to give them a try. I couldn't have been more pleased. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added some cheese and italian bread crumbs to the stuffing. They were amazing. All of my guests raved and they disappeared before I could get my paws on a second mushroom. These are going into my heavy rotation list.

Based on some of the reviews, I thought a little tweaking might do the trick. I added bacon and some cream cheese to mellow out the predominant sun dried tomato taste. Topped with a little feta cheese. Tasty.

This was very delicious. My husband isn't a big mushroom fan but he had half of them chowed down in 5 minutes.

I thought that these mushrooms were pretty flavorful. I made them for a dinner party. I also added parmesan to the mixture as well as some bread crumbs and additional herbs. I think they would have been too tomatoey without the additional ingredients. These were good but not as great as I expected (considering the reviews) and they were not all gone and gobbled up as some other cooks here experiences. Not a show stopper!

This is really for those who like their sundried tomatoes. I don't mind sundried tomatoes, but not as a main ingredient, so they're not for me. My guests seemed to like them, but I won't make them again. If you love sundried tomatoes, go crazy!

I have made this for several gatherings. Each time they are the first thing to be finished! I add a small amount of parmesan to the mixture.

I made these for a cocktail party this weekend. Everyone loved them. I asked my husband if he had tried one and he said "at least ten-they were awesome!" One of my guests said I should give up my day job and go into catering...great recipes like this earn such comments. A real crowd pleaser and easy to prepare.

Excellent dish, after you double the cream and add a 1/3 cup grated parmesan to the tomato mixture. Add more thyme, too. Enjoy!

Prepared this for supper club Sat evening. With the basic recipe, the sd tomato flavor is dominant. In order to balance out the flavor, I added: 1/4c red wine 1/4c bread crumbs 3Tbs Parmesan cheese 1Tbs ground basil 1ts each- chervil/marjoram/dried parsley These ingrediants were added with the chopped mushroom stems and sd tomatoes. I also increased the cream to 4Tbs After adding the cream, I continued to cook the mixture until most of the liquid had been absorbed/evaporated. I ended up with much more filling than the recipe specifies; I was able to fill another 18-20 mushrooms. These were a definate crowd favorite and I had several requests for the recipe. I expect to prepare these again.

These mushrooms are wonderful. Very fresh tasting and not too heavy. A perfect cocktail party appetizer. I used both button and crimini mushrooms--both worked very well.

yum don't over-broil the mushrooms like I did.

In the last couple of weeks, I've prepared this recipe at least three times. It's excellent and I'm forwarding it to friends. It's not only a great side dish but I intend to fix it with Portabello mushrooms and serve as an entree for a vegetarian meal. You won't be disappointed.

Served these at our neighborhood wine tasting to rave reviews. For the sake of convenience, I skipped the broiling instruction, but they were great anyway.

The recipe was kind of a pain to make (especially cleaning the shrooms). I don't eat mushrooms, but I got positive reviews from those who ate them. They disapeared very quickly. I won't make them again unless requested.

I am not a mushroom fan, but I have to say the 2 times I made them the disappeared within minutes. EVERYONE RAVED about them. I had to give up my secret recipe (LOL) so that my friends could make them.

This was a pretty appetizer, but it was too tomato-ey and very boring. Followed the recipe w/ the exception of a sprinkling of parmesan before baking. It needed bread crumbs and more cheese to liven it up. Won't make this again. Not sure how it got so many raves...

Delicious! Six women devoured all 25 of these within minutes, despite having two other appitizers and a six-course meal to follow. Everyone loved them.

I made 3 different types of stuffed mushrooms for a party and of the 3 these were my favoite. I was concerned that the tomatoes would be too overpowering but the combination of herbs and cream mellowed out the tomatoes. Added parmesan cheese to the mixture & also topped with more. Very nice!

We were unable to find mushrooms large enough to stuff and used medium sized Portabello mushrooms instead, combining the removed stems with some regular mushrooms for the filling. We also added a touch more cream, which cut some of the tang from the sun dried tomatoes. Superb, and very elegant.

I served this as an appetizer at a party, it was a big hit. There was not one mushroom left

I was looking for something different to stuff mushrooms with, and after seeing this recipe, I was really excited. I dunno if my expectations were too high, but no one (including myself and my boyfriend) particularly enjoyed these. I was expecting them to disappear quickly, but there were still several left over after the party. We've concluded that we're just not big fans of sun dried tomatoes.

I made a big batch and they disappeared quickly off the hors d'ouvre tray! Got positive comments and requests for the recipe.

this is a real crowd-pleaser, especially among the vegetarians. I add some minced rosemary (1/2 tsp dried or 1 tsp fresh) during the saute and 2 tbsp progresso italian bread crumbs at the end. careful cooking these or your mushrooms will turn to mush!
