What is not to love about the combination of walnuts, gorgonzola and a freshly roasted beet? The other stuff in the recipe is background noise. Good noise - but not the star. If you have fresh beets, this combo is a must. Also see beets, feta, pinenut/carmelized onion recipe combo here on Epi. Lord... Yum.

Solid 3 fork salad. Simple to prepare and very tasty. I used arugula for greens and the extra bite really was good. The dressing was a little garlicky, but thankfully we all ate it so we won't offend. :)

I think beets and gorgonzola have a natural affinity for each other. I agree with one reviewer about using watercress - it adds a nice peppery touch in contrast with the sherry vinegar. I also used about half the amount of olive oil, but made sure the oil I used was very fruity. This salad even had my beet-hating husband convinced!

It's a really good salad but not a life changer. Get a great gorgonzola if you can. Lovely presentation (if you put the beets on the bottom, or they bleed).

OPPS - accidently lowered the rating for this delicious salad (especially with the additions I mention below) by neglecting to mark YES, I would and do definitely make this recipe again and again. Also, if you don't have Sherry vinegar, quality white wine vinegar works just fine - and if you don't like garlic, a simple olive oil/white wine vinegar dressing is also very good.

This is a fine recipe. I like to add some watercress and thinly sliced Belgian endive to the mix of greens. Also to make it a light but satisfying lunch or supper, I also add diced cooked (Yukon gold)potatoes separately on top of salad and let diners toss again just before eating (beet color will bleed on the potatoes - but the presentation is lovely. For a truly regal touch, you can serve with breadsticks wrapped with prosciutto or very thinly sliced good quality ham - Black Forest works nicely.

This is an excellent salad. I like it as a first course. I have made it once with a fairly hard Swiss blue cheese and again with an Italian gorgonzola dolce. The dolce is vastly superior if you can get it. The Gewurztraminer wine goes beautifully with it. I may try the other beet salad on this site (1998) with the creamy gorgonzola dressing but it seems a bit more work.

Very Good! I used hearts of palm and 2 cans of beets for the ease and frankly, there was very little left after a Christmas dinner for 8 adults. Actually, I made it for the color but it turned out to be a keeper.

I tossed the greens and beets separately in the dressing, as I felt the flavor is better that way. I then topped the greens with the beets, gorgonzola and walnuts for a nice presentation. Very good salad!

I made this salad last weekend, and it received great comments and compliments. The combination of beets, toasted walnuts, and gorgonzola is excellent.
