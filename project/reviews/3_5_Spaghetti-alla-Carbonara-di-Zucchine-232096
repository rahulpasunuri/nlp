The Italians make everything so simple.. and so delicious! Added an extra egg, and baby bella mushrooms. So delish! Make sure to use freshly grated parm as opposed to pre-packaged stuff. It makes all the difference! Oh, and ditto on the extra garlic :)

REALLY good, and simple, I have to give this 4 stars for taste + simplicity & ease of preparation. My kids loved it. I used 3 cloves of minced garlic instead of just one, and added about 1 T. real bacon crumbles for a bit of smoky bacon flavor, and my kids devoured it. I liked the filling yet not heavy flavor. This is going into our regular rotation!

This recipe is good, but I made a number of changes that I felt were necessary and the end result was really very good. I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 1; I didn't discard them. I added fresh spinach when the zucchini was almost done. I also seasoned the zucchini-spinach with salt and pepper and added about 1/4 cup chopped chives to it. I tossed the pasta with the eggs and seasoned them with salt and pepper and put it on a plate, and put the zucchini on top and tossed lightly. Last, I added a little more chopped chives and pepper. I would definitely make it again, but will try adding capers or chopped black olives next time.

Wonderful simple dish! After reading the previous reviews, I increased the amount of garlic (chopped) and left it in. Also threw in some broccoli and onions to go with the zucchini. Our 5-year old gobbled it up. A definite keeper.

Made this last week after reviewing and incorporating many of the suggestions to enhance flavor. But still found it very bland and boring. Used zukes from our CSA and local organic eggs and the best parmesean but still just an unsatisfying result. Simply not a lot of flavor.

Very easy. Quite good with farm-fresh zucchini and basil. Used extra everything (recipe's amount of egg and cheese, extra basil, but pasta for only 2). Tried putting in chopped garlic but it burned and had to take out. Not a huge wow dish, but quick and easy.

This is fabulous. So good and so simple. I make it all the time. Can be a main course or a nice side with salmon.

haven't actually made this yet but it is the exact recipe my husband's cousin's italian husband made for us when we were lucky enough to visit them in Piano di Sorrento. i love zucchini tossed with evoo and pasta and grated cheese but hadn't remembered Gian-Paolo adding the eggs which put it over the top.

We made this and loved it. Here are our changes: less oil, more garlic (which we left in), 4 slices of prosciutto chopped and sauteed with the garlic, 1/2 onion chopped and sauteed after the garlic, red pepper flakes mixed in with the egg and cheese, everything sauteed al dente using zuchinni from our garden.

Delicious and so easy. Did not double the "sauce" and liked it as it seemed to adhere in a nice cheesy way to the pasta. Topped with scallops & served -- to rave reviews!

This has been a staple in our house since it was published. I've made it many times. The key is to make it with farm-fresh, flavorful zucchini (and not the cardboard stuff they have at the grocery store). It's perfect ever time. My kids even eat it!

This was very easy and tasty. I would definitely add more garlic and leave it in. You could almost add anything to this and it would still be yummy. If you are looking for overwhelming flavor, this isn't it, but if you are looking for a simple base, this is perfect.

A nice, simple summery dish. Easy for a beginner such as myself. A quick question to all you more experienced chefs out there -- I am trying to cut down on fat/cholesterol. Would using eggbeaters as opposed to eggs be an appropriate alternative?

I'm a big fan of this recipe-it's so easy to make with minimal ingredients. Big flavour!

Very good. Perhaps perfectly authentic the way it is but I'm still in the add more of everything camp. Double egg, double cheese, maybe double zucchini, definitely double garlic and leave it in.

Fantastic recipe! Talk about authentic Italian cooking. Doesn't get much better than this.

I really like this dish... a great version of carbonara without bacon, and I recently found myself digging through old food magazines trying to remember which issue this recipe was in. Fortunately I found it again here on Epicurious.

Have made this recipe a couple of times. Super easy to throw together, but have made some changes. Since I'm only cooking for two I use half the pasta but still two eggs, which helps a lot with the flavor. Also I probably do about a cup and half of cheese, add onions, and at the end before tossing just sprinkle on the slightest amount of crushed red pepper for kick. To cut back on the oil, just put enough in for a very thin layer to coat the bottom of your pan, but make sure it is very hot before you throw the veggies in.

I made this with whole wheat spagetti and it wasn't too greasy at all!

Mmm...delicious!! Best, of course, with homemade pasta. Only warning is that it's very rich, and generates lots of oil!

I knew this was a simple pasta before I made it...but this was somewhat bland. Maybe good as a side dish.

This is a really terrific recipe to have on hand. I agree: a bit less oil and more cheese. I grow basil on my window sill, so I use lots. Also, I now slice the garlic & leave it in. Good with spinach, too. Yum.

I love this recipe and have made it 4 or 5 times already. Extremely simple. I have tried it both with crushed garlic and the whole garlic clove, both are good. I agree that a little less olive oil is probably right, and I don't measure the parmesan - but I probably double the amount from the recipe. I agree asparagus would be great - I'm going to try that. I added pancetta once and that was great, too. Oh, and I use the cubes of frozen basil from Trader Joe's - I add two to the parmesan/egg mixture and they add great flavor. I'm sure fresh basil would be a little better but I don't always have that on hand. Definitely try this for a quick weeknight meal!

This pasta dish is delicious however I would make some changes when I make it the next time. There is so much olive oil in it, I will try it with 1-2 tablespoons next time instead of 5! You feel as though you are "deep frying" the zucchini. I will then replace the oil with a little wine or broth to add liquid. I did add more basil than called for and would do so again. This is a great recipe, very simple, quick and delicious. You could easily replace the zucchini with other vegetables (asparagus, spinach, etc) and still have a winner.

Follwing the earlier reviewer's suggestion I added a bit more basil and cheese than was suggested. In addition, I used minced garlic and left it in the mixture. It came out delicious and was relatively easy to make.
