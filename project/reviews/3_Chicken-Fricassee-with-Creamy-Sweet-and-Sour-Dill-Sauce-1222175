I had to modify this dish to make it mid-week: no time to make broth from scratch! I sauteed cubed chicken breast in one pan then made the roux in another with a can of lo-sodium broth, adding the chicken and vegetables (pre-sauteed onion & celery, sliced baby carrots, sliced mushrooms, cubed red potato because I had no parsnips) after it had thickened. I knew I was going to be eating it for two days so after the carrots and mushrooms had cooked through I ladled it into two seperate containers and put one in the fridge and finished the one I was about to eat with the vinegar and dill (you don't want to be refrigerating the soup with the dill already in it. It gets weird) It was tasty on its own, but I made some cornmeal dumplings the next day for the second batch. Not particularly scandanavian, but really, really nice on a cold night!
