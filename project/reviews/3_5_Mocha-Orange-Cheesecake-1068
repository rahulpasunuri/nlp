Try this reciepe w/o the expresso powder for a fab. chocolate orange cheesecake. I cant sleep with all the caffeine and everybody raves about it this way.

I made this for my birthday and it was a hit. I didn't think the coffee flavor was too strong at all, but I used instant coffee granules instead of instant espresso, and maybe that's not as strong? I was also afraid I had under-cooked it, because it was still a little jiggly in the middle when I added the sour cream topping, but it was still really good and had a nice silky texture.

I made this cheesecake a few times in the late 90"s and early 2000's to rave reviews of my guests. I was heart broken that after a move in 2006 that I could not find the recipe any where. My sister suggested I do a search and bingo here it is again. I can't wait to whip this winner cheesecake up again!!!!!

Well - I was excited to make this but ended up not thrilled with the results. On the plus side 1) crust was good 2)cheesecake baked great - did not crack 3) easy to make - but I really was expecting a more subtle coffee flavor and that is not what we got. I made it 48 hours in advance as suggested by another cook. If you are truly looking for orange and coffee flavors in a cheesecake, I would make this crust, find another orange cheesecake recipe and use the topping here in this recipe - and then you would have layers of flavor. If you want a strong coffee flavored cheesecake - this is your recipe - go for it.

So excited to find this recipe! Ten years ago, this was the number one most requested cake I was asked to bring to a family function......Haven't make it in five or six years and will be making it this weekend for my son's 22nd birthday.

This was a very tasty cheesecake! The combination of chocolate and orange is always good, and the addition of coffee provides yet another layer of complexity. Thanks to previous reviews, I increased the bittersweet chocolate slightly and decreased the coffee in the filling. As a result, I thought the balance was quite nice; a pleasantly obvious coffee flavor that wasn't overpowering. For the crust, I used chocolate wafers with a lot of orange zest (didn't have the Pepperidge Farm). The crust worked well with the cheesecake. Overall, this was good, but not outstanding enough that I would make it again.

I made this for the third time. It is very, very good.

I'll have to second on North Reading, MA's comment. I was expecting the chocolate to be more pronounced than the espresso. Not that it wasn't good...just different than I expected. Maybe it was the Medaglia D'Oro brand espresso powder that I used that was very strong. I could see getting a caffeine buzz from eating it! Steer young children away. Crust was excellent. As always when I bake a cheesecake, or something with custard, I placed the pan in a bain marie while baking. Helps to ensure a gentle, and even cooking method. Made a spiderweb design on top with extra batter by making circles within circles, then dragging a wooden skewer in criss-cross fashion. Made for a Halloween potluck after all.

I've made this three times so far. It need to chill for 48 hours for the flavors to blend. It's a great cheesecake. We really enjoy it. It also works well with reduced fat cream cheese, and fat free sour cream.

I vegan-ized this recipe (made it with soy cream cheese and tofu, egg replacer powder, and graham cracker crumbs, cocoa powder and orange zest in lieu of Milanos, left out the topping altogether) and loved it! Others didn't like the combination of coffee and orange, though - maybe just mocha or just chocolate and orange would be a more popular mix.

Just excellent! I was lazy and added all the batter to the filling. After the cake was done I pushed some chocolate lace decorations by Betty Crocker to make an elegant design on the top. Drizzle a little Silver Palate Orange Chocolate topping on the plate and you have a very nice presentation.

Of all of the cheesecakes I have ever made, this is my personal favorite. The blend of orange and coffee flavors reminds me of one of my very favorite tiramisu recipes. I love orange, so I substitute orange cappuccino powder for the expresso powder which carries the orange flavor into the topping. I finish each piece with an orange slice and a healthy dollop of coffee-flavored whipped cream rather than chocolate curls. I am not a coffee drinker, and you do not have to be one to love this cheesecake. Besides, I am always looking for an excuse to eat Orange Milano cookies. Hey, who isn't?

Sinfully delicious. For the crust, I melted the butter and added to cookie crumbs. This made the crust a little hard to slice. I baked the cake for 55 minutes, as at 50 minutes it was still very shaky in the middle. Garnished with shredded orange peel around the plate, chocolate curls and thin orange slices on top. Also, wasn't able to find instant espresso powder in my area, so substituted an instant granulated coffee. This tasted great, so imagine the espresso would have intensified the flavor if you can find it. I'm making this again this weekend for another dinner party.

Superb! Make sure it is cooked through. The first time I made it, it was too runny.

This was good, but I love bittersweet chocolate better than you know what, and there should have been more of it and less coffee, to my mind. Next time I'll cut the coffee about in half and increase the chocolate to 6 oz.

I love a good cheesecake and this is good. Really good. Great. Oh, just go make it already!

I save my magazines, and looked to see if there was a photo of this and there was.(just to see the finished product) I made this for a cookout and received a lot of "oh yeahs" "awesomes" and "yums." I will surely make this again. I think I may melt the butter for the crust first. I have a small food processor and had a "good" time trying to process everything at once. Great cheesecake!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wonderful recipe! Definitely one of my favorites. Instead of the suggested topping, I topped this one with a Grand Marnier Fruit salad to make the liquer a stronger part of the cheesecake. The extra fruit and liquer on top also makes for a livlier presentation!

The flavors in this cheesecake are absolutely delicious. My family loved the unique combination of orange and mocha! Although I like to try new cheesecake recipes rather than repeating ones I have made before, I have actually made this cheesecake several times over the past several years because it is SO GOOD (and my 9-year old son keeps asking for it)!

Excellent Recipe!!! You should try it!!!
