I made this multi-color fingerlings and used dried tarragon as that's what I had on hand. It was a delicious side to the grilled steak and salad. I'm using the leftovers in my chicken pot pie tonight

Absolutely fantastic. Have made this a few times now. The recipe is wonderful as written, but playing around with different herbs has been fun as well. A little bacon is fun too!

Oh my! This is an amazing recipe! I didn't understand tarragon until I made this recipe (and I'm not a fan of licorice). So wonderful with the potatoes. I did substitute chicken broth for the water, which added more flavor, in my opinion. So easy too. YUM!

Easy and delicious. But, I simply couldn't bring myself to peel the potatoes and I used my garden herbs and substituted the thyme for the tarragon.

Delicious. I haven't written a review before, and my doing so now doesn't meant this is the best recipe I have ever used on epicurious, I just finally decided to add 2 cents on something tasty. The potatoes were a perfect consistency, good glaze, the garlic flavor was infused in them (I used 3 cloves though, as we LOVE garlic). So easy to make as well. throw in the pan and then they are done. I even had fresh herbs in the house, but got lazy and didn't use them (already made a rack of lamb with the herbs as the main dish), and the potatoes were delicious. So, next time I will add the herbs. good luck!

This is 4 forks for the general method, as I had no chive or tarragon. These were delicious, as I didn't have the specified herbs I tossed in a few sage leaves when I uncovered the pot. The glaze was fantastic.

USE HALF THE TARRAGON CALLED FOR

Only change I made was to substitute fresh thyme for the tarragon. Easy to make, beautiful and very tasty results. Suitable for guests/special meals - will definitely make again.

This was quite good - easy and nice enough to serve at a dinner party. It's just as the description reads!

Halved the tarragon, tripled the garlic, and substituted chopped green onion in the last 2 minutes--phenomenal!

I enjoyed this as a side to grilled steak. I made it twice, once without any herbs and once with the herbs. I liked both, but agree the tarragon, if not used sparingly, can be overwhelming. Overall, I prefer the simplicity of the braised potatoes without the herbs.

I don't know what the other reviewers did, but this was an easy and wondeful dish. Fresh tarragon is a terrific fresh herb. Don't omit it.

Not sure what the other reviewers were eating. This was simple and tasted wonderful. Don't skip the tarragon it's a wonderful fresh herb

I definitely don't recommend this one... I don't know who would want their potatoes to taste like licorice. If you skip the tarragon, it's a pretty good recipe though.

I agree that this is not as good as the other stuff on that menu. I think new potatoes are better just simply boiled and then buttered and herbed.

Did not give this any forks - did not like it at all. The chives and tarragon were just plain weird tasting with the potatoes. The cooking method did not work for me either. Everything else on the SprigTime menu was delicious. Skip this one!
