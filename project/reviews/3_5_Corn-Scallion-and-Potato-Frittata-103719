Very tasty. I made some changes to ingredients and methodology..I sauteed the potatoes first, then added the garlic and green onions, thinking they would be charred beyond recognition before the potatoes ever cooked. As it was, the potatoes were slow to cook, so once they were browned I added some chicken stock to simmer them in. I added mushrooms and half a red pepper and cut the corn in half. Also added some minced chives, cilantro, and oregano, and topped it with shredded Romano. I also added some buttermilk to the eggs and cheese, which gave it a nice tanginess.

A great dish for Easter ham! Added chopped poblano peppers,and used Monterrey Jack cheese instead of cheddar. Might try some cilantro next time. So adaptable and so easy. Definitely will make again.

Loved this - although did tweak the recipe a bit. No mozzarella in the fridge so used Parmesan instead. And did half corn and half frozen peas. Oh and no scallions either! Heavy on the seasoning and it was yummy

Just OK for me. It was underseasoned and stuck to the pan (both my fault, I realize). If I try it again, I'd add bacon & green chiles.

I used two small potatos, 6 eggs, a few crimini mushrooms, and a couple stalks of chopped asparagus (additions to recipe). Also made with a mix of gruyere & mozz cheese. totally forgot the garlic (even after I prepped it!) but it still was great. Start to finish in my big iron skillet. we used salsa or organic ketchup with some toasted California protein bead to make breakfast & dinner meals. Added some sauteed spinach for a complete dinner. All organic ingredients. Easy, healthy, & delicious.

This was great! I added mushrooms with the corn and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese right before broiling.

I made this as the entree for dinner & it was great that night as well as leftovers for the next night.

Super good! I stuck to the recipe and highly recommend it.

Like others have said, this is easily modified. Today I made it with 6 eggs, a small onion, several shallots, fresh corn, a finely diced red pepper, portobello mushrooms, gruyere cheese and rosemary. Wonderful!

This may sound like a strange addition to the dish, but it was my mom's secret ingrediant to her corn and potato chowder.... fried chicken seasoning. I buy it in little plastic bottles in the spice aisle. It's exactly what this recipe needed. Oh, and I took someone's suggestion and used gruyere.

Good and light, the corn made it nice and sweet. It did lack a little bit of flavor, though, but really good with a bit of salsa on top.

Rating: 4
Cooked recipe exactly as is, and it's perfect. Very light, perfect flavor with just s&p. Took some time to cook...but otherwise easy. Next time, I'll sub Gruyere for Mozzarella for a little more depth of flavor.

This was sooo good. I didn't have scallions on hand so I chopped up some onion and chives as my white and green parts. I also made it with 6 eggs and 6 oz cheese because my potato was large. Will definitely make this again. Not sure what all of the bland comments are about. It's not spicy, but it's not without flavor either. My husband ate over half of it in one sitting. A hit in my book.

This was okay. Not that much flavor even with the addition of extra garlic and cayenne. It was, however, tasty served with salsa.

Delicious. I added two more eggs b/c I had a 12 inch skillet and my results were perfect. Otherwise, followed recipe to the tee. It was a bit more time consuming than I expected, but easy tasks... just chopping. Great w/ a salad &/or fresh tomatoes and bread. Yum!

Great! Made as is and was perfect with a salad as a fairly quick and light weeknight dinner.

This is just as delicious as everyone says it was! It's simple to prepare (I think I browned the bottom a bit, so watch for that). I'd definitely make again.

This is a delicious combo and I've made it many times. It's very adaptable to alterations too. I like to use two finely chopped leeks and saute those with the corn (only use fresh corn, BTW) in butter, adding this to the potatoes. I increase the eggs to 6 and then it serves 4 people nicely for brunch. I also like to add fresh herbs, like a tablespoon of chopped chives or even dried fines herbes if you have it.

I made this dish last night and loved it. It was quick, easy and tasty. I modified the recipe by using parmesan and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, and I didn't use garlic at all. I also made the whole thing on the stove top and it worked just fine. Depending on how you cut the potatoes, they may need more than 10 minutes in the pan to get tender enough.

Rating: 3
My variations, based in no small part by helpful reviewers below: I use one small onion, rather than the green onion with a little extra the garlic and finely diced potato. I add one finely diced red pepper with the (fresh, sweet) corn addition. Rather than cooking the fritatta on the stove at this point, I pour the veggies into a round casserole dish and add the egg/cheese mixture on top. I substitute jalapeno jack cheese for the mozzerella, and add an extra egg. Cook for about 35 minutes at about 375 (give or take) - serve with some fresh salsa on the side. Delicious for brunch or dinner (with a crusty bread and a glass of wine), re-heats beautifully, and so simple, adaptable and easy! Great recipe.

Folks, To add just a touch from a guy, I have added bacon to the basic rcipe, I've also included some pepper medley (includes cayenne) to give it lift. I also dropped a little parmesan cheese when it went under the griller. Enjoy

I suspect a lot of things would jazz this up, such as green chiles. But as is, it was quite bland.

This was delicious! For extra umph add a dash of nutmeg and a tablespoon of finely chopped fresh italian parsley to the egg mixture. I used an extra egg as well and prepared it in a 12 inch non-stick skillet.

Well this was a good recipe, but turned out fairly bland. I'll make this again, but will experiment with it a little... maybe some herbs (rosemary?) or more garlic?

Fabulous! We make this whenever we are having people for brunch. I top with sliced tomatoes -- when they are in season!

Yum yum yum! To the cook who complained of chewy potatoes - you control the finished product! I presume you cut them into chunks too large and then didn't sautee them for long enough. And as for the 'lumpiness' - it's a frittata, not an omelette.

Delicious, made it last night with salad for a light dinner. I did everything on the stove top and it came out perfect. Had one slice left over for breakfast this morning and it was delish !

Nice way to use up some vegetables . . . I added much more garlic, crushed red pepper, fresh parsley, chopped onion (along with the scallion). It was very savory and rustic.

Rating: 1
The potatoes never got done, despite my having cooked them at least twice as long as recommended. The whole thing was lumpish, despite the fact that I used six eggs instead of four. It didn't have much flavor, either. My husband and I ate it because it was there on our plates, but we didn't like it and never plan to cook it again. There are many lighter frittatas that I love, with mushrooms, herbs and parmesan.

We used fresh sweet white corn which is so delicious this time of year! (Only needed 1 cup) Used jack cheese and added roasted red bell pepper.

Delicious! I used egg beaters instead of eggs and low-fat mozzarella cheese. Also, I omitted the oil and used a fat-free cooking spray instead.

I thought this dish was good but not great. It was a little bland. If I were to make this again (and I probably will) I would use cheddar cheese instead of mozz for an extra kick. I used less corn than called for and it still seemed too much. I would like to experiment with other ingredients, such as sausage or other meat. In any case, this recipe is a good starting point for a lot of different combinations, and that's why I gave it 3 forks.

This dish is great with chopped zucchini as well. I make it often for brunch. As another reader stated, it reheats well too.

Rating: 2
I would make this again, with modifications. It seemed to need a lil' kick. Maybe fresh herbs, more garlic? I like the suggestions to serve with salsa. As everyone said, the main reason why this recipe is appealing is that it is easy, forgiving ingredients-wise, and keeps well (without getting too greasy)--we were able to enjoy it again the next day.

I thought this was wonderful. I did make some adjustments. First since I was going to make potatoes O'brien anyway I just added the peppers in with the potatoes. Also I used a Mozzerella/sharp cheddar mixed and served with biscuts and Peppered gravy. Oh My was it Good! Also Used a little fresh salsa on the side

Rating: 3
This one is going into the regular rotation-- yummy! By necessity, I substituted shallots for the green onions, used half parmesan/half goat cheese instead of the mozzerella, and added an extra clove of garlic on the advice of earlier reviews-- so quick and satisfying! I agree with the earlier post who praised the always-on-hand ingredients for this recipe; I'd add that it's also incredibly easy to substitute, too. Next time I'm trying it in the oven like the others recommend and adding some fresh tarragon or maybe cilantro and serve it with salsa...

Have made this dish twice in one week ...very good, add an extra egg for sure. Fresh herbs add a nice touch, I used sage. Half the corn amount works better and I added a drop of cream. Baking in the oven works very well, just grease the dish. Serve with a green salad....delicious !

Added the green chiles as recommended. This was a huge hit and was loved by my family whom I made it for. I also baked it completely in the oven which was easier. A big success.

A terrific recipe that will appeal to virtually everyone who enjoys eating eggs. Why four stars? The process of preparing this dish is simple enough to be nearly foolproof. The dish tastes and indeed is, nutritious, fresh, and wholesome. It is remarkably cheap relative to the great amount of pleasure you get when you eat it. It reheats like a dream. More likely than not, you have everything you need, right in your kitchen without a minute of thought, and better yet, without a trip to the market. It can be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner. --AND-- It contains all four food groups, is portable, and my three year old will eat it!

Outstanding! I made this with canned sweet corn (2 cups like the recipe says), and also added an extra clove of garlic. I baked it like a casserole in my oven at 375 degrees for approx. 35 minutes as suggested by previous reviewer. Delicious!!!

This recipe has become the central part of the meal I serve when I have unexpected dinner company and when I just plain forgot to defrost something. It's easy to keep the ingredients on hand, simple to prepare and delicious. Great with a salad, crusty bread and your favorite wine.

Followed the recipe with one exception, I used Gruyere. Next time I will try slicing the potatos thin and leave out the corn. My opinion is that unless you can get fresh corn in season the frozen corn doesn't add that much to the flavor. This recipe will become a staple in our house.

Rating: 4
This was truly delicious, although I made some of the adjustments suggested by other cooks. I cut the corn in half and added a can of green chilies, both excellent suggestions. I suggest that it be served warm rather than room temperature for the best flavor.

This was a great dish. I tripled the recipe for a large crowd (10 people) and baked instead at 375 degrees for approximately 35 - 40 minutes. A 13x9 baking dish (sprayed with Pam) is perfect for tripling. The only other alterations I made were adding about 100 cloves of garlic (not really, but a lot more than 2) and I cut the corn in half as someone else suggested. I used about six ears to give me the three cups needed for the tripled recipe. Serve it with fresh salsa for some added zest. Delicious!

Made this for a brunch with adults and kids, and all loved it. I followed Seattle's advice about halving the corn, and was glad I did. Also, served it with 2 kinds of Mexican salsas on the side, which allowed those that wanted to spice it up.

What a great combination of ingredients! I did substitute cheddar cheese for the mozzerella but I doubt it made much of a difference. Just be sure to cut the potatoes into a fine dice so they'll cook quickly.

This is a great recipe. Made it for brunch and it yielded more than enough for four. I thought it was pretty simple since I sliced the potato with the food processor. Also, used fresh corn...I think that makes a big difference.

I made this recipe today as part of a brunch for 10 people. I doubled it and baked it, as one of the reviewers suggested. It was absolutely delicious. I did not find it bland at all and it got rave reviews at my house. It was also attractive. I wasn't sure, though, how long to bake it or at what temperature. I wound up with two different temps - 350 and 400. It took about 45 minutes. Next time I'll bake it at 400 degrees and check it after about 15-20 minutes.

Yes, I'd make it again if I had to, and after giving it some serious thought about what to do to give it some life. The chili option might be the best option (or even some very finely diced jalepeno??). As is, it is quite bland. I also think the recipe calls for too much corn; it could easily be as much as halved. Be careful not to brown the garlic at the beginning - it could be very easy to do with that long cooking time with the potatos. The recipe has potential, but you will need to tweak it to your own personal taste.

Quadrupled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan for a large brunch - perfection! Everybody thought it was delicious, different and assumed it was difficult to make - boy, were they surprised when they heard the hardest thing was dicing the potatoes!

Excellent frittata, do not expect a "tortilla espanola" or spanish omelette, because it is not, but the flavors and the lightness of it is very good. i will definitely make it again. my husband really liked it. i don't think the mozzarella is totally necessary.

A wonderful and easy dish to prepare. I have made it for a dinner with a tossed salad and also as a brunch item for overnight guests. All have loved it. The frozen corn works very well. I also used green onions one time. Still worked very well. I think room temp is the best way to serve.
