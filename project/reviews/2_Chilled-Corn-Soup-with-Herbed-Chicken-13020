This was one of the oddest recipes I've ever tried out of Gourmet. I had the ingredients, so I thought I'd try it. We both thought the soup was good by itself and the chicken was good by itself. Combined, the taste was just too strange. I won't make again.

Yuck. Its not just bland, its unsalvagable. My husband and I tried it hot, cold, with cream, with sour cream, with and without the chicken... I had even used sweet corn! I think it was the potatoes that ruined it. My advice it to look elsewhere for a corn soup recipe, this will only break your heart and waste your summer sweet corn.

Not too bad, although a little bland (possibly because my wife would not allow the full dose of cumin or cayenne). It is an excellent alternative to a heavy cream or half and half based chowder. And it's easy, to boot.
