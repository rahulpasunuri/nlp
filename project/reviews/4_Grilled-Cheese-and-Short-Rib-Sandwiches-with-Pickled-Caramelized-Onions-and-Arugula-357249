made these as sliders for a recent party. was concerned about it drying out during the party -- so we pureed the vegetables and cooking liquid and added back into the shredded meat. worked out really well and will definitely serve again.

crazy good, an upscale phillie cheese steak. I accidentally used raspberry vinegar instead of red wine, but it still rocked the house. will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times and am cooking it tonight for guests. Great over polenta for dinner, then use the leftovers for sandwiches, so the effort is definitely worth it. It also works great as a way to cook chuck roast. Much cheaper than short ribs and still awesome. For the sandwiches, you definitely need a hearty bread.

I made the short ribs in my crock pot the day before. I used boneless short ribs, worked best! I used a really rustic hearty bread and my pannini maker and they were fantastic! I went to Joans on Third and had he sandwich and it was just as good.

This recipe is more work than I would like for a sandwich, but the way the ribs come out, it's worth it for that alone. the flavor is remarkable. I intend to make short ribs using this recipe again. I substituted Pinot Noir for the sherry but I don't think it could have turned out better.

Wow this is one of those over the top sort of things you probably don't want to indulge in too often. The amount of butter was a bit much for me and used a lot less with perfect success. I love short ribs, but given their cost I just wonder that a fatty roast might accomplish the same goal for cheaper. The cost per serving of this dish was $4.10 relative to my yearly average $1.41. It's definitely on the make again list, but i would probably use leftover pot roast next time.

My friend and I trade off making the cover recipes from Bon Appetit each month, I was lucky enough to get this one...absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly as written, made the ribs one day in advance they were falling off the bone and the onions and arugula give it such great flavor. Prepare ahead and it's a simple meal, even the kids thought it was the "best grilled cheese EVER"

This is the first time I tried making short ribs. I could only find bonelss short ribs, so I tried those. I think I will look harder next time as I'm sure that changed the texture and flavor. I had to thicken the sauce before serving for dinner with the polenta so it would be more like gravy. This was good. I just had the same meat as the sandwich and it was delicious! The onion flavor is perfect with it. I didn't even grill the bread, just loaded up a slice of toasted bread with the meat and cheese and threw it under the broiler for a few minutes, then topped with the onions and the arugula and another toasted piece of bread. Better as a sandwich!

OMG,this was divine. I made the short ribs at the same time I was making the french onion soup (gourmet 2006 from this site) on saturday, chilled everything over nite, served for late lunch Sunday during NASCAR. Only changes; didn't make pickled onions because I had the soup and used high quality toasted hamburger rolls for the sandwich's, helped absorb the nice juices, my boyfriend had seconds of everything and between the lunch and the race and his couch he looked like he had been drugged with love!

Made this for company two nights in a row. The first night short ribs never fell off the bone - in fact I couldn't even cut them off the bone. Had to through away 5 pounds of ribs and run at the last minute to buy roast beef (which I soaked in the roasting mixture). Even with the rib fiasco - the sandwiches were wonderful. The second night I used pork with the same ingredients - did fall off the bone and sandwiches were excellent. Too much butter though and used much less the second night.

Delicious. Will make again and again. Made the recipe as written. Used monterey jack cheese. Was a big hit. Told that it was the best sandwich ever.

This sandwich was amazing. I am not much of an onion fan, but kept an open mind. All the flavors were exceptional together. Yes this is not a low fat, "healthy" dish, so would not make it often, but it is worth the splurge for a once in a while treat. Everything in moderation! Doing the meat in advance and allowing it to cool lets you get rid of some of the added fat. As to cooking the sandwiches my suggestion is do not turn the sandwich too soon, but allow the cheese to melt a bit, press down on it and carefully turn them. More filling fell out when I turned it too soon than when I took my time. The arugula that fell out became crispy in the skillet and really awesome to eat!

Whats with all the butter? I felt like Paula Dean, using nearly an entire stick of butter to prepare this recipe, and I only made four sandwiches&.no wonder my family enjoyed them so much. This recipe, from Joans on Third in LA, has as much fat per serving as a Big Mac. Now that I know about all the butter, I woudn't go to Joan's on Third. Im taking seriously the challenge by B.A. Editor-in-Chief Barbara Fairchild awhile back to cook the cover recipe from B.A. every month. Im disappointed, however, that this cover recipe doesnt fit with our familys healthy lifestyle. Yes, Ill make these sandwiches againwe especially enjoyed the purple pickled onions-- but I will substitute olive oil for butter. And why doesn't Epicourious show the beautiful photo from the magazine cover?

I thought this was very bland. I did speed up the process and put the ribs in a pressure cooker instead if simmering. They came out perfect in terms of consistency, falling off the bone. As for the flavor,even though I added more garlic and red pepper flake, it was still missing somethig. A for the sandwich, it was messy, and blah. i will be looking for a better short rib recipe, and probably won't serve it in a sandwich.

I made this recipe exactly as suggested and it was divine! I did serve it with polenta and Brussels Sprouts the first night and as sandwiches the second day. They were delicious!

This was soooo good. I used the ingredients as is, but I didn't see how you could grill the sandwiches without the filling falling all over, so I toasted the bread in the oven and then laid the cheese slices on it and let those melt. Gave those to the family and let them heap on the meat and onions and arugula. Hardly anyone spoke, we just shoveled. Yum. I also did the ribs the day before and chilled the meat and sauce separately so the fat (a lot) would be easier to take off. I pureed the sauce in the blender, then reduced it until it would just moisten the meat, because it didn't cook down enough initially.

Even though I improvised with some leftover rare, roasted beef tenderloin and used regular wheat sandwich bread in a pinch, these were terrific. The arugula really makes it!

It is 12:28 am Tuesday morning and I just finished some of the ribs that were left over from Sunday evening.These are absolutley delicious both ways. I gave the sandwich a 3 and the ribs with the onions and polenta a 4. This is an easy but time consuming dish, so do this on a more laid back day. Great for the really cold winter we've been having!

Made this last night, but only did the meat and served as suggested over creamy parmesan polenta. It is out of this world delicious! My husband who is a tough critic said it was one of the best things I have ever made. I am going to make the sandwiches tonight with the leftovers.

I enjoyed this sandwich thoroughly. It is sort of messy to make but worth it.
