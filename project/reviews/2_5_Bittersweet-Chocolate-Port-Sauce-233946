This is a ratings update... Guess my tastebuds weren't working before. I made this sauce again and used it on the same cake recipe. It was wonderful! Please forgive and ignore my previous post.

This is a simple recipe, and based on the earlier reviews I didn't have high expectations for it. I used semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate and Jonesy old tawny port. I'm happy with the results -- not spectacular but the port lends a nice, slight complexity. I plan to serve it at a dinner party tomorrow night over vanilla ice cream with strawberries and blueberries. Next time I may try adding a tiny amount of chili pepper for a Mexican twist. Simple and pretty good.

This was easy to prepare but the flavor was a bit off. I love bittersweet chocolate but it seemed a bit too bitter for this warm sauce. Maybe a slightly sweeter chocolate? I served it with the Bittersweet Chocolate and Almond Cake (Tart) from this site, just drizzling a bit of sauce over the whipped cream & then sprinkling the sliced almonds atop the cake slices. I used the same bittersweet chocolate in the cake and sauce but they just didn't seem to match very well. Maybe just my taste buds...there weren't any leftovers!

It was like eating chocolate sludge. What a waste of time and elements.

This was a very simple chocolate sauce, and easy to make but I was expecting more port flavor. The bittersweet chocolate really overwhems it and I added a half-cup rather than the 1/4 cup the recipe calls for.
