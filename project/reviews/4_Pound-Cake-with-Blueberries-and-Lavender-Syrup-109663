Just made the pound cake as is... Was denser than I would of liked, the bottom and sides got fairly dark golden, before the cake was done baking. Served with strawberries combined with sugar that sat for a day or two to release their liquid, perfect for the pound cake. Next time I would do half a teaspoon of vanilla (overpowered) and another teaspoon of lemon zest (the slightest bit detected).

Oh my God! This is the most amazing pound cake I have ever tasted! This recipe works out so well! Im really happy that I tried it. It was really moist and soft. It felt like biting into a soft pillowy cloud. It was slightly crusty on the outside but lovely and light on the inside. I will definitely make this cake again. I and my mom, made it together, today. It was a great bonding moment :-) (touchwood) (Thanks Epicurious!) I tried this recipe without the Blueberry and Lavender Syrup, and increased the sugar by another half a cup (total 2 cups) to compensate the sweetness that the syrup was going to provide. I highly recommend this cake to everyone. It tasted great when warm and even better when completely cooled. For this recipes cake batter I used an 8x3x2 inch and a smaller 5x3x3 inch loaf tin. I filled the tins ¾ way. Please do make this cake! Everything about this cake is amazing! This recipe is going to my personal collection of recipe book.

This is perfect pound cake recipe. Wonderful velvety texture, great flavor, and very moist. I served it with sliced local strawberries and sweetened ricotta whipped with a little heavy cream.

This is THE BEST pound cake recipe that I've tried. Love the flavor that the lemon zest adds. I used 4 mini loaf pans and baked for 30 minutes. It came out perfect.

Such a simple recipe and so delicious! Loved the crumb on the cake I just had to bake another ... to give away.

This was just okay for me...granted I didn't make the syrup, but the cake itself was not as dense as I'd have hoped..nor as buttery. I'll keep looking.

Unlike most people here, my cake turned out light & fluffy - NOT dense. It has a great flavor, lovely crumb, etc. I don't know why my mileage varies (could be my sugar/butter stage = SUPER light & fluffy before adding eggs, flour, etc) or it could be that I baked it in my angel food cake pan (professional, vintage heavy aluminum; great, even conductor of heat) Regardless, it is a fabulous cake, i'm happy with the results and I'd make it again.

I brought this along to dinner at a friend's house on Easter. The friend is a major foodie, so the pressure was on! This dessert passed with flying colors and I was complimented profusely. The cake was tasty and moist and the lavender syrup and blueberries on top were perfect.

I just made this recipe for the first time and I'm in love!! I did make a few changes however, which I think are note worthy. I substituted milk for buttermilk and I zezted two lemons and added two teaspoons of juice. I also doubled the vanilla and baked in a bundt pan lowering the baking time to just one hour. I drizzled chocolate and lemon icing over the top and it was out of this world!!

I only made the pound cake. It's a good recipe. Two notes: --I had to bake it for 1hr, 20 minutes --I used a baking powder substitute instead: 1/8 tsp corn starch, 1/8 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp cream of tartar It seemed to rise better than with regular baking powder

I didn't make the syrup for this, I only made the pound cake. It turned out very well!

4 forks for my sauce modification. 2 forks for original sauce recipe. 2 forks for cake -- too much browning; shorten baking time. I didn't like the contrast between tart berries and the very sweet syrup. I tried it again -- made the syrup, then cooked the blueberries in it for about 5 minutes. Let cool a little, and served it over vanilla ice cream. Liked it much better this way. Probably good over pancakes, too.

The cake was Greattt!!! But I would like it to have less butter. This cake is like Sara Lee pound cake! Did not make the sauce.

Not a review but a question. I'm wanting to make this and the flower part is throwing me off. I called Whole Foods and all they have is the fresh lavendar (packaged) without the flowers. Is it ok to use the leaves instead of the actual flower? They didn't have dried which I was surprised about. Thanks!

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday because she loves blueberries. It was a success, and I would make it again. But I made some changes. I only used 1/2 the sugar for the cake recipe. I reduced the butter to one stick only and substituted 1 cup nonfat Greek organic yogurt, which made it lighter,less dense. I baked the cake in a ring mold, which decreased the baking time considerably. I didn't have dried lavender, so I used lavender sugar to make the simple syrup (1/2 regular sugar, 1/2 lavender sugar). I doubled the simple syrup recipe and poured half the syrup over the cake while it was still warm (as soon as I unmolded it.) I added extra blueberries to the rest of the simple syrup and put the blueberries in the center of the cake ring. I whipped cream with a little sugar and vanilla and served it with the cake. It was fragrant, beautiful and delicious!

I must admit...I didn't love this recipe as much as several others reviewers. Cake was decent, yet very dense. Watch your cooking time VERY carefully. Blueberry/Lavender syrup was tasty, but I would reduce the dried lavender next time, it was almost too aromatic.

I did not make the cake unlike 98% of my fellow reviewers. I love lavender. So I was intrigued with this recipe. I changed quite a few things. I doubled the simple syrup recipe. I REDUCED the amount of dried LAVENDER to 1 teaspoon. I also doubled the amount of blueberries. It was delicious. The next time I did the same thing only I RESERVED 1/2 the berries, then I purreed the lavender blueberry syrup and added cornstarch, put in the reserved berries and simmered to transform it to a wonderful filling.

I've never actually prepared the blueberries in syrup, but I've made this pound cake a dozen times, at least, and it remains a family favorite. Lovely texture and taste...I'm off to make it again, to partner with some fresh strawberries in Cointreau.

This cake is wonderfully simple. Very moist with a lovely crumb. I didn't make the blueberries and lavender syrup, just the pound cake. I used the batter as a base and added a few things to make different kinds of mini-cakes. One had orange zest and cranberries and I used the marbling technique from the Shabbat Mandarin Loaf Cake for another. I baked both kinds of cakes in round mini paper molds. I'll be sure to make this again with the blueberries and lavender syrup!

I've just made the pound cake, never got to the lavender syrup. I've found the pound cake to be pretty fantastic, though - moist and tasty. I don't like the browning on top and sides - I think a little is good, but cooked as per the recipe, it's a little much. So, I cook for about 1:45 at 280, and am quite happy.

I used this cake recipe as a base, adding apricots and ginger. It turned out nicely. The only thing that I wasn't too crazy about the fact that it came out a bit dense and heavy, even for pound cake.

Wow! I cut the blueberries and lavender syrup so that I could make a mission for 4th grade using pound cake! Everybody loved it, we ate it after open house and my teacher said that it was one of the most creative ones she ever had. And she was a teacher for about 25 years! You can also substitute the lemon zest for orange zest which give it a citrus taste!

I made this for Easter dessert; everyone loved it. Since I couldn't find the dried flowers, I just used the dried lavendar and it still came out with a lot of flavor and aroma. The darker color was nice, but most it was absorbed into the pound cake. Next time, I will try with the dried flowers to see the difference.

This is the recipe that I use for pound cake and I have made it several times. It is really excellent just the way it's written. I have made this with the lavender sauce and it was excellent also.

I only made the pound cake portion and that is wonderful all on its own. Though don't make the mistake I did and cook it in a glass pyrex loaf pan. It burned outside and undercooked the middle. I had to add more cooking time to cook it through, and by then the outside crust was pretty dark. A metal loaf pan would have been best. Even still, everything but the outside tasted great.

I just made the cake to serve with strawberries and whipped cream. Made a glaze out of confectioners sugar and lemon juice that I poured over the top and let set. It got RAVE reviews. This is a great basic pound cake.

Excellent! Amazing how the syrup transforms the classic but boring pound cake. I used frozen blueberries which worked perfectly fine. In fact, I think the blueberry juices from the package, which I added into the syrup, helped dilute the lavender flavour and make it very subtle, which was good because I was worried some guest would not take to an overly perfumy smelling syrup. But I will still try using fresh berries next time as I think I prefer them for their firmer texture and fresher taste. Oh, and the pound cake held its own too -- very smooth velvety texture and the lemon zest lifted it a notch.

i made the cake alone for another use and it turned out beautifully, though i overcooked it by about five minutes. the only change i would make next time would be doubling the vanilla. and obeying the timer.

I made the Blueberry and Lavender syrup to go with Aunt Rose's Pound Cake (April 2004). It was quite delicious. I will definately make it again. To push this recipe over the top, serve it with freshly made whipping cream-maybe with a hint of the lavender.

This is a lovely recipe! Very easy to make. I followed the recipe for the cake exactly without problems. I believe why one reviewer had a problem with the cake spilling over the pan is because her oven was not hot enough. A common problem. Most people heat oven to proper temperature, then put cake (or whatever they are baking) into the oven. The oven must reach desired temperature and kept at that temperature for at least 10 minutes in order the oven heat to be even as well as bake in the time a recipe states. Also, for another reviewer: No, not all dried lavender is edible! It should be purchased at a health-food store, or grown yourself without pesticides, and labeled 'organic'! So, anyway, a dolop of whipped cream and a sprig of fresh mint and you not only have a feast for the tastebuds, but for the eyes too!

This was a very easy, yet very sophisticated recipe with subtle flavoring from the lavendar. I did substitute frozen blueberries for fresh and simmered them into the syrup after the lavendar was removed. It worked great, but I would love to try it with the fresh berries. To the cook in Honolulu, there are definite differences in dried lavendar. Much of what is out there is for potpourri which can be tainted with mold or inedible additives or chemicals. Be sure to buy lavendar made for human consumption. Health food stores, spice stores, and tea shops often sell "edible" lavendar.

I had to buy a pound of lavendar at a restaurant supply store (couldn't find it elsewhere), but it was worth it - and my friends got some lavendar for potpourri. Excellent pound cake and sauce!

My mom loved it, my niece loved it, my sister in law RAVED RAVED RAVED about it. I shared it with my neighbor and told him, "When I eat this, it makes me feel really feminine." He said, "Yeah, me too." hahaha I have a silly question: How will I know if the dried lavender is edible? If it's dried & packaged, isn't it edible?

To catkins...Make sure you use the salt.. It's what controls the baking powder. If you delete the baking powder, you will have a brick instead of a cake.

Great taste! Easy to follow. Make sure to place the eggs in room temperature for 30 minutes. I didn't use whole milk and it came out nice. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/3 cups. Good complement with coffee or ice cream. This was my first time baking a cake from scratch. I feel so good about this!

I served this pound cake at a dinner party for 10. So yummy! Instead of the lavender blueberry syrup, I served it with Lavender Blueberry French Ice cream. Just add the blueberry syrup to a French Ice Cream base, pop it in your ice cream maker, freeze and serve. For the chocoholics in the group, I put several truffles on the side. To finish, I served frozen Limoncello liqueur and coffee. Yum!

Great recipe - easy to make. To the cook from Nashville, I believe the secret is to to use a METAL loaf pan, rather than pyrex. The lavender infusion is a unique spin for pound cake! The blueberry syrup would also be good on ice cream.

I carefully measured and mixed and added, checking the recipe as I went along. I didn't remember adding a levening agent to pound cake, but followed the directions. Alas, my pound cake flowed over the loaf pan and into the oven. It made quite a mess. Does anyone have any suggestions as to why this happened? I may try this again, but without the baking powder.

Really straightforward, simple, and elegant recipe. Only difficulty I had was in finding dried lavender to give the syrup a little more of a bluish/purplish hue. Alas, whatever I bought had the proper aromatic impact, but the syrup stayed clear. Should have just used the fresh stuff out in the garden!
