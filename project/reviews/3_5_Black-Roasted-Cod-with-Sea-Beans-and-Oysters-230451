I gave up the sea beans and black cod, since I was just looking for a new recipe to cook oysters for my boyfriend. He looooves oysters! I used to bake oysters with minced garlic and cheese. But then I found this and decided to give it a try. Since I didn't have 16 oysters but only a dozen, I cut the lemon juice in half to 2tsp. Besides, I added minced garlic together with shallot and it did give a little extra scent as expected. It was delicious but the oysters were sort of bland. I used to let them sit in mixture of salt and white wine for ten minutes before baking. With the 2tsp lemon juice, the oysters, especially the "soup" used to cook the oysters, turned out to be a little too sour. However, my boyfriend did finish all of them by HIMself!! As well as the soup!! He comments that this new recipe was as good as the old baking one lol. Hence I will definitely make it again!

Very fishy, but Yum. The only reason I would not make it again is that I am not a fish fan... I was just looking for something to make as a New Year's Day meal that would be symbolic of prosperity: and fish and oysters are it. I made this with "Sauteed Greens with Cannellini Beans and garlic" (beans and greens both symbolizing wealth... come on everybody, eat your beans & greens in 2009!). Very much an unusual meal for me (think pancakes for supper), but satisfactory. Once.

In the issue where this recipe appeared it says they are also called salicornia and are marine plants resembling thin asparagus, crisp and brilliantly green and can be eaten raw or cooked. They grow wild in salt marshes but are now being farmed on land once thought too salty to be arable and are in some produce markets or available by order from Melissas.com.

Epicurious' glossary says sea beans are another name for samphire (also called glasswort, sea pickle, marsh samphire or rock samphire). It's apparently a spiky plant, often pickled, and is available in some gourmet markets (generally in jars).

What are sea beans?

I used North Atlantic cod (where can I find black cod?) It was delicious, easy and fast to prepare. I used a little juice left over from the oyster over the fish.
