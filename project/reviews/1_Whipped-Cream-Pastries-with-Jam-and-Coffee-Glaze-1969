Funny, I too used it as a stable cream icing for a cake, not for this recipe. I too had trouble wiht the first batch not whipping properly. For my second attempt, I let the gelatine cool before I added it to the whipped cream which i whipped until almost done. Seemed to work better and held up on the cake.

I was looking for a stabilized whipped cream recipe, and even with the prior review, thought I'd give it a try. The previous reviewer is exactly right -- not a peak in sight. I suspect 2 things: too much gelatin for the cream, and poor directions. I have now tripled the amount of whipping cream, and am just beginning to see soft peaks. Frankly, since I quadrupled the recipe to begin with, I don't think I really want to add any more. A half-gallon of whipping cream is really a budget-breaker. :-( I've also discovered since making this that you need to start by whipping the plain (ice-cold) cream. AFTER peaks are forming (which shouldn't be more than a couple of minutes) start gradually adding the sugar and other goodies. I may try again, but not any time soon! Lucky for me my husband likes cream in his coffee!

The whipped cream portion of this recipe failed miserably. It did not form any peaks (stiff or otherwise), even though I followed the instructions precisely.
