Made this to go with the Yucatan Mahi Mahi as printed. It is good, and works well with the recipe, but nothing special in particular. Used 1 habanero and 1 lb campari tomatoes (not sure how much "3 large" is...) - I thought the salsa was pretty wet, so my comment would be to seed the tomatoes before chopping.

I had to rate this 4 forks because my Mexican mother loved it, as did my American husband. It was very good, I love the lime juice. Spicy, so anglos beware! Use half the peppers if you can't handle the heat. Takes a log time to chop too!!

Spicy! Beware! We did half a recipe, using only 1 habanero and it was too spicy to eat. Also, you must use rubber gloves to cut the peppers.

Great salsa. We used serranos and this salsa was HOT. I added diced avocados to the leftovers and served it with omelets for breakfast. I think I would not finely chop the onions next time or add fewer than called for. It was onion 'heavy'. I really didn't pick up on the orange flavor??

This turned out to be just what I was looking for, a decent salsa recipe with something to balance the heat of the habaneros. The oranges just what the salsa needed. I've made the basic recipe listed here w/o the oranges, but it always seemed to be missing something, now I know what. Should have looked to the Yucatan! Great stuff, not for the faint of heart.

I altered this recipe significantly so am not sure if 4 forks is appropriate or not, but I was very happy with the results. I put 9 habaneros and the tomatoes under the broiler until the peppers were blackened... Let them sweat, peeled them and the tomatoes. I sauted 7 cloves of garlic with the onions until soft. Put it all in a blender with 1/2 c. lime juice and 1/2 c. white vinegar, 2 oranges, 1/2 T. salt, and 1 c. cilantro. The oranges helped balance the heat of the peppers. Delicious!
