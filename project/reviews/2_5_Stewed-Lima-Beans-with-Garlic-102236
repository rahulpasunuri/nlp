Simple. When you love a fresh vegetable, you want to taste it. You can. Of course you can add whatever you want. I often add chopped red hot pepper. But as is, it stands.

I'm a fresh lima lover and savor the small time of the year I can find them in farmers' markets, so I may be a bit biased. Loved the addition of garlic, and I mixed the olive oil half and half with unsalted butter. A little sea salt and white pepper made these really good. Don't try this with those frozen things that are better saved for long-cooked chowders and casserole things.

I agree with the revewer who said the dish was bland. Adding chopped olives might help. used frozen lima beans and the dish had a slight bitter taste.

i serve it with lemon chicken, and its mellow flavor goes very well with the sharp taste of the chicken. The garlic gives it a lovely touch.

This dish was bland. My husband and I both decided it was not tasty enough to try again.

This recipe was interesting, and a nice way to fix fresh lima beans. I served it for Thanksgiving and it was well received.
