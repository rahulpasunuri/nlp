This is excellent and easy. I made 1 change... Removed cinnamon early as I thought it too predominant.

STUNNED by how good it is. Absolutely without a doubt one of the top five recipes we've tried from Epicurious. Used a bit more shallot than called for, added about half the corn starch mixture, the full amount of lime, and about a tablespoon of kosher salt and a hefty amount of black pepper. Use for pork, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, maybe even simmered a bit more and mixed into a grilled cheese sandwich or quesadilla...

Loved the sauce. I only had two chops so I used the ingredients as listed in smaller amount...to taste, actually. I used a can of sour cherries packed in water and used the juice as part of the reduction. Also used Sangria instead of just red wine. It was sweet and gave a fruity flavor to the sauce. I used unsalted butter to help thicken the sauce...without it the sauce tasted bland and had no depth. It came out delicious!

So this is my revised recipe for those who would rather have chicken than pork. Make the sauce as listed. Take chicken breasts and trim to the size you desire. Cut the chicken breast in half leaving just a small portion attached so it is still one piece. Dip in egg white, and then coat with Panko (Japanese bread crumbs) Pan fry until golden brown on each side. Remove from frying pan and let cool for a few minutes. Open the chicken breasts up and stuff with sauteed shallots, gorgonzola cheese, and candied pecans. Use a toothpick to hold together and put into cassarole dish and bake at 375 for 35 minutes. Cover with the black cherry sauce, I use the frozen dark sweet cherries from the supermarket. They come in a 12z package. This is my top dish for company, surpassing my prime fillet mignon with lobster. A true gourmet delight.

I've been making this recipe for a few years and I follow it exactly. Tonight I made it with tilapia instead of pork, and it was equally delicious. There's a grocery store nearby that sells big tubs of sour cherries every year at this time, so I always stock up on sour cherries and freeze them.

We have made this several times and always to rave reviews. Following other's suggestion, we used dried cherries and reconstituted them in a bit of water. To add a twist, we used a dry chipolte rub on the grilled pork chops. The smoky flavor is a wonderful contrast to the sweet sauce. Yum!

I was really looking forward to the meal, based on the other reviews, but the pork was bland and the sause, even with fresh picked sour cherries just did nothing for me, I'm bummed I wasted all those cherries....

I forgot to note that I've successfully frozen leftover sauce and reheated it later. That's in case you actually HAVE any extra sauce!

I've made this several times, and it's always a hit. I'm making it again tomorrow for our 4th of July barbecue. Rather than using pork chops, I grill a pork tenderloin, and then slice it and serve on a platter with the sauce drizzled over. I season the tenderloin with salt and pepper, or an herb spice rub before grilling. Instead of fresh or jarred cherries, I use dried sour cherries from Trader Joes, which are always available, and work perfectly. This one is a keeper!

My husband and I truly enjoyed this recipe. The cherry sauce was wonderful. Although, I added the full amount of lime juice, and next time I would add less.

The pork chops are simple and good, but the cherry sauce makes this dish amazing. I didn't have access to sour cherries, so I used dried cherries soaked in wine/water. My guests loved it. I served the chops with roasted onions in molasses with bacon (also on epicurious) and everyone thought the flavors mingled perfectly. Try it! It is easy, too.

I made this dish with dried sour cherries, and pan fried the pork chops. Incredibly easy, delicious, a keeper. Would go great with chicken too, and the sauce was terrific over a side of wheatberries and pecans.

Kids loved the cherries! Big hit!

Delicious! Very tasty dish, not too sweet. The tang of the balsamic compliments the smoky flavor of the pork. I left out the cornstarch as the sauce thickened up nicely without it. A good use for summer cherries, I will be making it again.

Tried this while experimenting with recipes without garlic, ginger, or other strong spice things. I did not have a cinnamon stick, so I used some ground cinnamon, used canned sour cherries, and more lime juice than recipe called for. This was surprisingly good. Not as good with chicken in our opinion.

Like other reviewers, I did not have sour cherries readily available, so I tried substituting 8 oz. dried cherries. I soaked them in the chicken stock at the outset, so they were nice and plump by the time it came to adding them to the sauce. Not having ever used the sour cherries, I have no basis for comparison, but it got rave reviews!

My husband made faces when he saw the combo of ingredients, but was easily won over by the unique tangy flavor. Now that this dish passed his taste test, can't wait to try it our for a dinner party.

This receipe was a nice change. I made the sauce and served it over skinless, boneless, chicken breasts which I sauted in a pan. I added sage and parsley at the end and served it with basmati rice with herbs and a nice green salad. I served the meal with a Erath Pinot Noir from Oregon. I would definitely make this again, even for a dinner party because it was so easy and the sauce can be made in advance. I would serve it even over duck breasts or a sirloin steak (omit sage and use tarragon or thyme).

I made a low-sugar version of this. I omitted the sugar at the beginning and added 1 Tablespoon of maple syrup at the end. It was delicious! We ate the left over cherry sauce on chicken breasts the next night and I think that was even better than the pork!

I made this dish for a birtday dinner. I personally thought it was great and would make it again. The rest of the family (8 other people) gave it 1-2 forks. They were not as impressed with it as I was. I also made the southwestern lime grilled chicken with ancho chili sauce for those who didnt like pork, and that dish (also from this sight) got RAVE reviews. I would like to make it again but after the reviews I got, I will be more discriminating who I serve it to.

The sauce was very easy to make. I used dried cherries that I soaked in hot water before adding to the sauce. Delicious!

I thought this recipe was great. It even looked beautiful. It looked like we had paid $100 for our dinner. I made it with the garlicand herb mashed potatoes. It was wonderful. I would make it again in a heart beat. Also very easy to make.

This is fabulous. It' easy to make and easy to eat. My husband loves it. This is the second time I have made it and I will make it again. I also agree that the sauce would probably be good over filet mignon or chicken. Try it.

This is a tasty dish and worth making. Since it was raining I grilled the chops in the oven and it came out really well. I could not find sour cherries so I used canned cheries, washed them off and added less sugar to the vinegar.While cooking the sauce had an odd smell but it turned out well in the end.

I've made this many times and it is always well recieved. Such a fresh taste!

My parents have sour cherry trees in their backyard. Needless to say, I go picking every summer for fresh cherries! I just made this dish tonight, and it was very good. The sauce was a very nice complement to the pork..not too sweet. The only problem is that it's extremely difficult to find fresh sour cherries. Aside from my supply at my parent's (which is only available once a year), I have yet to find a place that sells them!

This is a superb company dish! I can make the sauce and freeze it and have available with filet mignon roast and add cheese. everyone raves about this one.

I used frozen, drained cherries, and found I had to double the amount of cornstarch to get the sauce to thicken sufficiently. I made the full sauce recipe for only 2 chops, and will use the rest (about 1/2) to serve over pork tenderloin wrapped with rosemary sprigs, grilled, and sliced. Next time I think I will toss some star anise into the sauce along with the cinnamon. I served this with baked sweet potatoes, which was wonderful. Mashed sweet potatoes would also be good. Also served brocollini, which was...brocollini. This is a very nice sauce for a pork loin. One other comment. I put fresh ground pepper in the sauce, and it seemed always to float to the top. So when you taste it for seasoning, it may seem very peppery. But when served it was much less so.

I used the cherries from Trader Joes that a previous reviewer said they had used. They worked great. I also increased the amount of red wine (I used Pinot Noir) and decreased the amount of chicken broth. It was a great sauce - and we served it with a Pinot Noir. A defintite make again recipe.

I approached this receipe with caution since I usually don't like sour sauces. I do have to admit, this was really good! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Make sure cherries are in season when you decide to make it. I made this dish 2 weeks before cherry season arrived so thankfully, follwed the advice for Trader Joes jarred Morello cherries (listed below) and it turned out delish!

Ab Fab! I approached this recipe with hesitancy, as my husband and I are not big on sweet sauces. However, the other reviewers (thanks!) said such raves, I figured it was worth a shot. I used fresh cherries and reduced the amount of sugar. The leftover sauce is great over chicken breast or pork tenderloin for a quick weeknight supper.

I used fresh cherries right off the tree. I also made only half the recipe since there are only two of us. I knew there would be more than enough sauce. It was just delicious - enhanced rather than covered the flavor of the chops.

My husband grilled 2" thick pork loin chops to medium perfection. He thinks this is one of the best cherry sauces he's had. I used a 24oz. jar of morello cherries from Trader Joe's. I saved the juice for another use and lighly rinsed the cherries. This gave me 2 cups of fruit and except for the cornstarch and water, I reduced everything else proportionately. This made plenty of sauce for 6 servings and we had that much pork. Deglazing the balsamic vinegar and sugar is a smelly process, but that is what mellowed the final result. Other than dried tart cherries or other canned versions, I don't think I've seen sour cherries fresh or frozen.
