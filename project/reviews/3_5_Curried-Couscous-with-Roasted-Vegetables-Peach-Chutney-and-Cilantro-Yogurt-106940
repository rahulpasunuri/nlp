I thought this was a great recipe! I used it as more of a guide, I wanted to get rid of some veggies before we went on a trip for a couple of days, Instead of the prescribed veggies in the recipe, I roasted brocoli, tomatoes, and zucchini, I also drizzled lime juice, evoo, and salt and pepper over the veggies before I roasted them. I also used quinoa instead of couscous. All in all, this was a delicious dish.

Excellent and easy couscous dish! I added a can of chickpeas for some protein and served the whole thing hot with store-bought mango chutney...yum!

This was very disappointing after reading all the rave reviews. The best element was the Peach Chutney, more a salsa than a chutney. We found the meal overly dry, despite the cilantro yogurt, which was overpowering. I will use the left over cilantro yogurt with falafal and the couscous with a more spicy saucy dish. I will make the Peach chutney again, that was surprisingly good. Fresh peaches weren't available, so I used canned which worked a treat!

This was delicious. The different flavors of the curry,roasted vegies the peach and the yogurt go really well together to make a unique and tasty combination. Will definitely make again.

This was way better than I thought it was going to be. It really works together to make a coherent dish. I wanted something warm so I served the veggies, hot, on top of the couscous, also hot. I'm sure it would be good cold and mixed together too. The cilantro yogurt makes it. Only mistake: 50 minutes was too long for the eggplant.

Awesome dish. Made it as a weeknight dinner, so I cut the veg smaller to cut the roasting time! Also increased the amount of veg and added carrots. Not sure where the "hot" comes from? If you like spicy I would definitely add some cayenne. We had this with a simple lemon-pepper grilled chicken breast.

Delish! We added roasted carrots and used toasted pumpkin seeds in place of the cashews (which I would highly recommend). We also added green onion to the yogurt mixture. I'm sure the leftovers will be just as good.

I cut a few corners - didn't add a sauteed onion to the couscous and used a bottled mango chutney - but it was still great! Lots of flavors that popped. Using the convection roast on my oven cut the total roasting time for the eggplant down to 30 minutes, so it was very quick to put together, too! Great light supper.

I had high hopes for this dish, but was underwhelmed. The couscous dish needs more spice - 1 TBS curry powder is not enough. Also, 50 minutes was way too long to roast the eggplant. The peach chutney and cilantro yogurt were both delicious and are an absolute must -- otherwise the dish is dry and bland. I'd make the chutney and yogurt again, not sure about the couscous.

This is a light and delicious meal. I always make extra and it's great served room temp. I also use mango chutney.

Made this dish for a dinner party of 6 and it was very well received. The couscous was flavorful without being overly spicy. The 50 minutes for roasting the eggplants was a little too long. In the absence of currants, I used dried cranberries, which worked really well. The yogurt was absolutely delicious, and it's a must with this dish! I also used store-bought peach chutney, which was sweet with a bit of kick, and complemented the other flavors perfectly.

My family and I thought this dish was okay. I doubled the amount of yogurt dressing. Not sure if I'll make this again.

This was a delicious and easy recipe! My guests really enjoyed it. I did substitute the eggplant for yellow squash b/c the guest of honor doesn't like eggplant. It was very tasty with the yellow squash and took less time in terms of roasting. I am sure the eggplant version is delicious too.

I followed this pretty loosely but loved the results - it provides a great, modifiable framework. Perfect blend of spicy, sweet and tart flavors. For the yogurt, I skipped the salt and sour cream and didn't miss it. I added a little cumin. I roasted carrots, potatoes and tomatoes for the veggies, with oil, garlic, salt and pepper. At the very end I added roasted red peppers too. I used jarred Indian mango and mixed fruit chutney. I followed the couscous directions pretty closely, but used curry paste rather than powder and skipped the cashews and currants (didn't have them). Labor intensive but well worth the effort.

This was great, but you HAVE to include the cilantro yogurt and (any) chutney. Without those accompanyments, it was sort of dry. This was, however, a bit hit at my semi-weekly Monday night dinner.

A lovely side dish to accompany grilled fish. A bit labour intensive. The cashews and currants are a nice touch.

This one will please even my carnivorous friends. I omitted the sour cream, which made a thinner sauce, and substituted lemon for lime (just because that was what I had). And I topped it with a bit of feta. Delicious!

I thought this was ok, but not fantastic. Lots of work too. Would probably make it again...not sure what changes I'd do...needed more zip. This time I added some curried chicken to it. Liked the yogurt & used jarred hot mango chutney.

I love this recipe. I always double it because it's too labor intensive to make in small amounts. My only complaint is that the couscous sometimes comes out a little dry and requires more cilantro yogurt to moisten it than the recipe calls for.

I've made this dish twice with great results. Guests loved it both times. I have to admit that I didn't bother with the peach chutney because we had several jars of different chutneys on hand from various gifts and whatnot, so this gave us an opportunity to have a "chutney tasting" which definitely added to the fun of this dish. It's a keeper.

This was boring, which makes sense if you look at the ingredients. One tablespoon of curry is not enough for the several pounds of vegetables and couscous called for. For this amount of trouble I expect something memorable. This was dull, dull, dull.

I made the yogurt/cilantro dip using non-fat yogurt and sour cream. It was delicious -- everyone raved about the flavors. Wonderful meal for a hot day.

This dish was a real hit at my vegetarian dinner party, particularly the peach chutney. Personally I found the cilantro chutney a bit salty so I cut it with more plain youghurt. I will use a different cilantro chutney next time. I sprinkled the vegetables with curry powder prior to roasting as recommended by others, and followed the couscous instructions exactly. It turned out great. One tip: I roasted the eggplant for 25 minutes first, then added the eggplant and peppers (chopped) to the same roasting pan.

This is the type of dish that you can variate based on what you've got on hand. I substituted the veggies with roasted carrots and used Israeli (pearl) couscous. Instead of letting it sit for the back 10 minutes, I had it simmer for 6, then sit for 4. Fantastic!!!

It was the least popular dish at the buffet table. The theme was Mediterranian/Indian/N.African cuisine. I was disappointed, especially considering the amount of time and effort spent.

I took this to an Indian themed pot luck. It was fabulous. On just looking at the couscous and the two accompaniments, I couldn't see how it was rated so great. Once on a plate with the chutney and cilantro yogurt...delicious. They work so well together. Of all the dishes on the table...mine was the one being oohed and awwwed.

My fiancee absolutely loved this. Based on reviewer comments, I added hot curry powder and cumin to the veggie seasonings before roasting (yum!). I don't think I'll bother flavoring and toasting the couscous next time. The veggies were the best find here. Also, roasting the sliced peppers in the oven saved me time.

I made this the first time for a dinner party. The guests loved it so much, I had to part with the printout of the recipe and cross my fingers that it was still on-line! I will be making it again this weekend. This time BBQing all the veggies, as I will be camping. The recipe is simpler than it looks.

I made this for a block party. The peach chutney and yogurt were superb and really complimented the coucous dish. I did want some spice. I used hot curry but it needed more umph somehow. Next time I'll add some pepper flakes or something.

This was ok, and pretty good. It seemed like a lot of work though. I didn't do the peach chutney, used mango, didn't add the nuts, used some raisins instead of currants. Maybe these substitutions would have made it a stellar dish. I liked the cilantro yogurt but would not put sour cream in it next time. It doesn't need it.

The couscous was absolutely delicious and the subtle taste was wonderfully complemented with the chutney and yogurt. I would suggest not adding the cashews until JUST BEFORE SERVING, as they soften and lose their crispiness!

I enjoyed this greatly, but my husband thought it needed something. (Probably meat.. Y'know how these ex-Wisconsin farmboys are...) I tripled the curry powder and recommend adding more cashews. The chutney was superb - you may as well double the batch & have it on hand.

One of the best recipes that I've found on the internet. The only alternation was a little bit of hot pepper to the cilantro yogurt for a 'kick'.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Absolutely FABULOUS!!! Although somewhat labour intensive, if made all at one go, it is very much worth the effort. I made it for a group of 'discriminating' cooks...and every single one of them raved about the color, the texture, the condiments, the FLAVOUR!!! I did, however, make some minor changes to the original recipe: by doubling the curry, the currants, and the cashews when preparing the couscous. The cilantro yogurt and peach chutney played an intricate part in complimenting this dish...although I will make keep both on file to serve with other dishes. Ummmmm!!!

I usually don't find that "flavored" couscous works, but this was a marvelous exception. The cilantro yogurt was most refreshing (but next time I would omit the sour cream as it added little but fat). I served it with grilled meat for a dinner party but the vegetables/couscous were the real stars.

Rating: 4
Instead of roasting, I grilled all the vegetables while I was preparing the water and cous-cous. After making this for a dinner dinner, I liked it so much I made it for a backyard party of 50 -- the peach chutney and cilantro yogurt were easy, and I did them a day in advance. This meatless side dish for a crowd with a fair number of vegetarians was the hit of the picnic -- elegant, filling, but light.

This was a great dinner -- especially good for two cooks. The food was beautiful in appearance as well as very tasty. Since it was served at room temperature and we started in the afternoon, there was no last-minute hustle and bustle. The peach chutney was "beyond compare." We served this dish with salmon poached in citrus.

I LOVE THIS DISH!!! The coucous absorbed the curry and the onion flavors just right on their own and the tanginess of the cilantro yogurt concoction was heaven!!!! It makes for a very light dish--feeling satisfied and not gluttinous. Although I didn't get a chance to make it with the black currants and nuts, I'm sure it will enhance the divine nature of this dish. . .

to the cook from Menlo Park, in the future, you don't have to separate the leaves from the cilantro bunch, the stems are nearly as tender as they are, and are not woody. plus, pureeing the cilanto makes it nearly impossible to distinguish whether you're eating stems or not.

Rating: 4
This isn't a quick dish to make, but well worth the time. It was absolutely delicious and my family has already requested that we have this again. Definitely make the cilantro yogurt even though it is quite a pain to pick all of the cilantro leaves off of the bunches. The peach chutney was really great as well. Everyone had a little of each and couldn't decide which they liked better with the dish.

Have not tried the recipe yet but in response to the comments from Vancouver - the "CURRY POWDER, CHUTNEY, AND YOGURT" in the dish is probably why EPICURIOUS refers to the recipe as being "Indian"!!

Delicious, but more work than it was worth. The couscous alone is a great side dish which I will certainly make again. Concur other vegetables would be a nice addition, or substitution for the eggplant.

This recipe is good, but I think would benefit from increasing the amount of vegetables (there is a lot of couscous!). I added some roasted pumpkin which worked well.

Tasty, but why the heck did Epicurious decide to describe this as an Indian meal in the introduction? Couscous is from the maghreb (i.e. saharan north africa) which is about a thousand miles from India, and nothing else in the recipe is particularly Indian. Oh well, it was pretty tasty anyway, but I think we should give the Moroccans and Algerians some credit.

The Cilantro Yogurt is a wonderful companion to many full-bodied foods. I have had a version served as a sauce for poached salmon which included some fresh, grated ginger root. It is also delicious with many foods, both plain and complex.

Very tasty. I simplified the recipe a little by using bottled mango chutney and just roasting the peppers along with the zucchini. The cilantro yogurt was a nice touch. This will definitely be a staple.

This was a great, easy recipe. My favorite part was the cilantro chutney -- something about it just keeps making me want to dip slice after slice of naan in it -- or just pour it over the salad. This was my first experience roasting peppers over an open flame. I think that with all the mess, it's really just easier to open a bottle. But other than that, great! I served with Tandoori Spiced Chicken (from Bon Appetit 7/01) sliced on top (used boneless, skinless breasts) and an excellent Riesling. This one will go into my rotation.

This is SO GOOD! I have made this 3 times so far and I am still craving it. It is a little bit time consuming though. So I did not do the peach chutney and the eggplant after the first time and I used bottled roasted peppers.It still was delicious. I found that the best order to do things is to put the vegetables in the oven, then start the couscous and do the cilantro yogurt in between. I will definitely try the yogurt and the chutney with lamb burgers.
