This was very good! Like other reviewers, I made several smaller size calzones rather than one big one. I definitely think the idea to strain the mushrooms and spinach is a good idea. I did not squeeze it, but just drained it in a colander and it still had a bit too much liquid. Next time I would try to remove more of the liquid. I used homemade ricotta (I know, obnoxious of me to say that but if you haven't had/made homemade ricotta, it is so easy and so worth it! ðŸ˜Š) and overall, this was just a great dinner. I highly recommend it.

Fantastic. Easy to customize and personalize. The Fontina is the key, I believe. WOW.

Here are my tips: 1) Strain the mushroom and spinach mix to drain out excess water and prevent the calzone from being soggy. 2) Instead of just pressing the garlic, mince the garlic so someone doesn't bite into one of the 2 garlic cloves and to add a stronger garlic flavor. 3) Spread some cornmeal on the parchment paper under the calzone. 4) Add some cooked spicy Italian sausage. 5) For me, there was no need to leave an inch border to seal the calzone. Next time, I'm going to fill it to the max and leave half an inch around the border for sealing. 6) Instead of making 1 massive calzone, I'm going to make 4 smaller ones next time. 7) Prepare a marinara sauce on the side.

Fantastic. I used the cheap Pillsbury dough and they still turned out great. I would chop the spinach next time, and I did add 1/2 pound of browned italian sausage. I think the Fontina really made it special. I did have to adjust the heat; at 425 the bottoms burned. 375 for 15 minutes worked for me better.

really great! I'd definitely make it again. I cut out the ricotta, added a clove of garlic, scaled back on the fontina just a bit, and threw in some bell pepper that I'd chopped small-ish and sauteed for a minute. I don't like my spianch ultra-wilted, so I wilted half, tossed the hot mix with the remaining half, and let it warm up together while I pulled the dough. I made one big calzone, but next time I'm going to stretch the dough then cut it to make 4 small ones (can't stretch dough quarters in a timely manner). A bit of sauteed shallot wouldn't hurt, either.

This was deeeeeelicious. Made half with hot italian sausage and the other half with mushrooms. The sausage added a lot of flavor. Since we live in new york, we bought the pizza dough from a local pizzeria and made the recipe even more amazing! Will make again.

This was really good for a weeknight meal. I used dough from Whole foods which was excellent and made four individual calzones. I don't see why you have to layer it though. May be easier if you just throw everything together. Will make again.

First time making pizza of any kind--what fun!! I made 2 medium sized calzones and each were big enough to serve 2. While baking, they leaked liquid and cheese from the bottom. I had sealed the edges perfectly but maybe I rolled the bottoms out too thin? But when I served them, they looked perfect! I used part-skim mozarella instead of fontina. Totally needs red sauce for flavor.

Left out the ricotta (didn't have any in the house) and it was fine! Used fresh mozarella (sliced it) instead of the fontina and it was still delicious!

Yummy dinner. My family loved it dipped in a little marinara sauce. I used trader joes pizza dough that tasted homemade. A little less fontina cheese was perfect, this recipe called for more than my liking. A good way to get the kids to eat spinach. I will make it again.

Made this recipe as written, and it turned out great. Also purchased a bottle of marinara for dipping, and it was delicious. Will make it again.

As suggested by ejoelleduval, I made four "small" (not so much!) calzones to take to work. Worked great. I used the pizza dough recipe from Deborah Madison's Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone (includes whole wheat flour). For lunch, I just put one in the microwave at work for a minute, cut it in half and eat with my hands. Easy!

I loved this recipe! As I could not find all of the correct cheeses, I substituted for other types, and works just as well. The next time I make this I will make it into 4 small ones so that they can be taken as a quick meal to work!

I have a hard time standing for long periods of time due to Fibromyalgia. But with this recipe I was in and out of the kitchen in less time than the recipe called for. The ease of preperation, great taste, and ingrediants make this something that will be made over and over. I may leave out the crushed red peppers the next time as they were a little bit too much for me. I would also be likely to add another layer of ricotta before the mushroom mix because I love it! I love the extra kick the fennel gives the recipe. Almost like having the sausage without the meat! Great recipe! I would rate this one 5 if I could!

I followed the recipe exactly, and was very happy with the results. My 18 month old and husband devoured it. I served with a side of marinara sauce and salad.

A nice, easy recipe. Not spectacular, but it was pretty good. I used store- bought dough, which made it super easy, but it would have been a lot better with home-made. 3.5 forks, really =)

i think taste alone would put this recipe at three stars, but it was so easy that I couldn't help but give it four! turned out delicious and was one of the few recipes to come together quicker than listed. would recommend!

Tasty! Good, quick recipe. I made my own pizza dough (epicurious recipe - surely better than anything store bought) which turned out perfectly. I'm always worried that vegetarian main dishes will not be filling enough (especially for my carnivorous boyfriend) but after two pieces of this guy, we were both full. Yum! My new alternative to regular pizza.

We really enjoyed this for sunday dinner. It was quick and easy to make and really really tasty. Makes one giant impressive looking calzone. Will definately make this one again.
