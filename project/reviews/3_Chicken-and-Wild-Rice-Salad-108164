I never review recipies but feel like I have to chime in on this one. All of the reviewers are substituting the sherry vinegar and then finding the recipie lacking. I have been making this for years and can say without a doubt that the quality of the sherry vinegar is the deciding factor! It is good with your basic grocery store sherry vin, but is fabulous with a gourmet sherry vinegar. You have to pay for the quality, but it is so worth it in salad dressings, especially this one. I also make this ahead to allow everything to meld together.

I thought this needed somthing more interesting so I added dried cranberries and toasted pecans. I did not have sherry vinegar so I susbstituted Champagne vinegar.

Good salad, but I thought the vinegarette was too oily and heavy. Loved the nuttiness of the wild rice with the tart-sweetness of the apples (used 1 Fuji and 1 Granny Smith). Next time I'll try it with a rice vinegar/orange juice dressing. Very good on a hot Summer day!

With the addition of dried cranberries and chopped pecans this dish has become a staple summer lunch. It keeps well, and it's quick and easy to prepare using a rotisserie chicken. I usually use balsamic vinegar. And a good quality dijon makes all the difference. Good dish to bring to summer potlucks and barbecues too, as it's good whether hot, cold or room temp.

Great recipe! I opted for the convenience of a rotisserie chicken, and added dried cranberries (allow time for them to plump up in the vinaigrette) and toasted pecan halves.

Wonderful dish. Will definately make this again. I used balsamic vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar. I also added dried cranberries.

A tasty little summer dish. I found that using a rotisserie chicken substantially simplifies prep. However, for me, the dish was infinitely better with top quality olive oil, sherry vinegar and dijon. Also this is one of those salads that clearly benefits from being made ahead of time to allow the flavours to relax and come together.

This made a great dish for a summer picnic. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the sherry, mixed half wild rice with half saffron rice, and added some golden raisins. The result was sweet and tart. I'll definitely be making this again!

2 forks is accurate, I like it but I don't love it. I did modify the recipe, I sauteed the chicken and onions together and then added the celery for a few minutes before I combined it all together, I also used balsamic vinegar and I used Jasmine rice maybe next time I'll remember to pick up the wild rice. I will definitely make it again but I will add some more things to it. The olive oil amount seemed way too high and really coated all the ingredients too much, thus the bland taste. I agree some dried cranberries or cherries would be excellent in this. I might try to add some asian touches too maybe use rice wine vineagar instead and add a little sesame oil.

I wasn't able to locate sherry vinegar, since I made this last minute for a party. I used balsamic (I used the full amount that the recipe called for) and added dried cranberries to the recipe. Also, I cooked the chicken breast in a flavorful stock and used some of the stock to cook the long grain wild rice in. This salad was a hit at the party! Someone suggested using dried cherries instead of the cranberries. I will be making this again, great taste for a hot day!

Didn't have sherry vinegar. Used white wine vinegar instead. Tasted bland. Added a little orange juice and it helped. I might add tagagon and some dried cranberries or currants next time. Needed a a little sweeetness.

For those working gals, I used a quicker store-bought 25-min wild rice. Also, I didnt have cherry vinegar so I used Balsamic vinegar with less than the recipe called for. An easy and neat way to prepare chicken differently!
