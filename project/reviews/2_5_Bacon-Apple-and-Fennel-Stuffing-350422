Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist, but for me, stuffing needs sage, savoury, or thyme. My daughter made this as directed, and after taste testing, everyone agreed the extra work was not worth it. Before serving it, we added sage and thyme.

My go to recipe for stuffing. I use cornbread instead. I've done shortcuts also because of time. The bacon just gives such a good flavor along with the apples. Will be using apples from my own trees.

We made this recipe as written, boiling the bacon at all. I do think I understand the reason behind the complicated bacon preparation: You want the boil the bacon to get some of the saltiness out of it, and then bake the bacon in liquid to get it crispy, but still a bit moist, without being greasy. That said, this recipe is an awful lot of work without a big reward at the end. After all was said and done, this was good stuffing, but not mind blowing stuffing. It was probably the least memorable part of our Thanksgiving meal this year.

Made the recipe, simplified it substantially by browning the bacon then cooking the onions in one frypan. Then put all the ingredients (including 10 cups toasted french bread) into a big pyrex dish. I had to punt on the amount of broth because I had changed the recipe some. I think I used too much broth. I then baked it for an hour or so. (I may have cooked it too long) It was good, but no one raved about it. It had a hint of sweet because of the the apples and fennel. No one could taste the fennel. This recipe has potential, but I will need to play with it to make it more interesting.

The recipe on page 171 of the Nov 2008 issue calls for 10 cups of 1-inch country-style white bread with crust.

Tasted good, but the preparation is ridiculous. Why boil and roast the bacon first? Not worth the time commitment.

I made this according to the recipe, but I'm not sure why. Many steps seemed needless; a waste of time. Why not just brown and drain the bacon instead of boiling, draining, adding liquid, and re-crisping? And what's with all the switching from pan to pan? It requires much more broth than stated. My bread was crusty to begin with, and even more so after they had me toast the cubed bread. The taste wasn't bad, but I would not make this again without a number of revisions.

I google this and found the real recipe. It calls for 10 cups of 1" cubed white bread with crust on.

4 cups bacon out of one pound? I am guessing 4 cups bread 1 pound bacon.

Not so much a review - but just how much bread does this require - it seems to have been left on the editor's cutting room floor
