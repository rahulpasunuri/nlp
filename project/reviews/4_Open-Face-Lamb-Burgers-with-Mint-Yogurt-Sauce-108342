Great recipe. I used 1 lb ground lamb for two people, followed the recipe (less onion, spices, etc. due to only 1 lb.) except served over cooked lentils ( 1 cup lentils simmered 20 mins in 4 cups chicken stock with 2 T minced fresh onion and 1/2 minced garlic clove, salt and pepper) instead of over the bread. Topped with the minted lemon yogurt sauce (strained the yogurt sauce as it seemed bitter with the mint pieces). Served with homemade hummus and pita bread. Will definitely make this again. One of the highlights of Epicurious recipes!

This is a fabulous recipe! I serve it in pita pockets, filled first with fresh garden greens, then I cut the burgers in half so they snuggle right into the pockets. Pouring the mint sauce onto the burgers tops it off. As others have said, it is becoming a favorite and regular dish on our table!

Skipped the salad topping and used romaine, tomatoes, roasted peppers, caramelized onions and fresh vadalia onions - AWESOME!

I carmelized some red onions and put them on top of the burger. I also brushed my burger buns with olive oil and cumin seeds and put them in the oven, for a toasted cumin seed bun effect.

I see that I reviewed this recipe about 4 years ago! I'm still making it for my husband and we still are loving it.

The burgers I had came already made into patties from the store, so didn't add anything to those. Butfollowed the recipe for the rest- except used fat free Greek style yogurt (very thick). was fabulous. good to let yogurt sit a bit so flavors blend.

These burgers were absolutely delicious  I made only a few changes to the recipe, but not big ones: I caramelized the onions before adding them to the meat (don't like raw onions), pan-fried the burgers and toasted the bread in the toaster oven. The yogurt-mint sauce was fantastic, even though I used fat free yogurt. Very simple and fast  will definitely make it again.

Made these burgers several times. Big hit at our house. I make mini burgers and give each person a couple or, in the case of my husband, four. I don't change a thing but could go with cuke in the yogurt and some of the other variations and will try.

Great recipe-the spices were just right but also added a little goat cheese to the hamburger mixture. Added grated cucumber and lemon juice to the yogurt sauce. Served in pitas but would have been better on a thin slice of french bread. Wonderful. Rave reviews from discriminating husband who loves lamb.

This was uninteresting. If I make it again I will add garlic and feta to the yogurt sauce, and perhaps finely chopped dill and cucumber as well.

This dish was simple to prepare and absolutely delicious! I used the broiler for the toasts and a stove-top grill for the meat, and the results were outstanding.

I make this recipe for dinner for guests and for dinners alone with my husband. It's become one of our standards.

I added one egg to the burger mixture, otherwise it wasn't holding together well. I'm not sure why you would want to serve the greens on top of the burgers; I put them to the side. Also, I like less salt than what is called for than the recipe; maybe 1/2 tsp. in the burgers, and none in the yogurt sauce or on the toast. Definitely an excellent lamb burger mixture, and I love the yoghurt sauce which complements them perfectly.

Made this for guests and it was a big hit. Very pretty presentation but has a casual feel to it. My wife has been asking for this again.

Delicious! Very different and fresh tasting. Perfect for the first warm day this spring. Served the burgers on warmed up (on the grill) greek pita, put the sauce on top and then added chopped tomatoes, cucumber and green onion. The fresh mint and tang of the yogurt was perfect with the lamb. Husband looked up after devouring most of his and said "This is really good". Will be making this many times this summer.

We loved this grilled lamb burger. It is easy and quick, the mint-yoghurt sauce is a delicious foil to the grilled meat, and eating it open-faced with greens on top is a nice twist on the usual bun. A meal in itself, we've had it 3 or 4 times this summer and plan to enjoy it watching the opening ceremonies of the Olympics

Delicious. You can't go wrong with a quick searing, and then a few minutes under the broiler. Moist and succulent. I served it with the mint yoghurt & the creamed peas with mint recipe.

These burgers were a nice change from the usual burger. My husband and I made these twice. We're big on buns, so we slapped the lamb between the halves of crusty french rolls and ate with our hands. The first time we grilled the meat according to the recipe recommendation. Too pink. We couldn't deal with the heavy, wet, raw texture. Next round, we grilled the burgers until they were cooked almost all the way through. We then achieved lamb burger happiness.
