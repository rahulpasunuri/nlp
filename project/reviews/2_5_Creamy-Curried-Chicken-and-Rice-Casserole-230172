Leave out: lemon, red pepper. Add: peas and chicken to vegetables after the flour and milk. Put rice in bottom of greased casserole. Pour chicken mixture over top of the rice. Cook uncovered for 30-40 minutes. Yum.

After reading the reviews I decided to modify the recipe a bit. I used hot Madras curry (2 tbsp instead of 2 tsp), red onion instead of yellow or white, and only used 1 cup of milk (2%) and ½ cup Chicken broth. I also cooked the carrots with the onions and added 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp cayenne pepper with the curry powder. Additionally I chopped up fresh ginger (approximately 2 tbsp) and 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, crushed. Lots of flavor, not too soupy and definitely a hit.

We liked this recipe for a family dinner. I forgot the lemon juice and I do not think it detracted. We sprinkled with Romano cheese which made a big difference. Will add Parmesan cheese on top from now on when baking.

Its never a good feeling when you are pouring casserole contents into the dish and you're thinking, "ugh, this doesn't smell or look good...". Needless to say, I was right- this was NOT good. As many other reviewers stated this has more of a soup-like consistency than a "creamy" consistency. The taste is off as well. I'm not sure if its the curry or what, but something is definitely off (and I'm a gal who loves her curry). Take a hint from the majority of reviews and skip this one- its not worth it!

Not to be repeated at this house. Basically the dish was one giant blob of rice, chicken, peas and carrots. No texture, spicy but uninteresting flavor. Perhaps it might have been redeemed by serving chicken and sauce over noodles instead. Face it, curry can't be done well in a casserole of leftovers.

Easy recipe and versatile to adapt to your liking. I followed 'A cook from Hoboken's' spice mix and the dish had a lot of flavor. I used brown rice, olive oil and rice milk instead of regular milk. That gave the dish a hint of sweetness which really complimented the curry. I also sauteed the red pepper and carrots for a bit before adding the flour/milk. The carrots had a perfect bite after baking and the rice wasn't mushy at all. Next time I'll throw in some small pieces of cauliflower.

I didn't find this bland, but that's subjective. I used olive oil, 2% milk, and marinated peppers instead of fresh peppers, no lemon juice, and grapeseed oil cooking spray. And my dinner guest went for thirds.

Thank you to the cooks who warned about the bland flavor. I took a cue from an earlier post, in which the cook did her own thing to rev up the flavor. This review is not of the actual recipe, so only read on if you're looking for help, not an accurate review of this recipe: I added an add'l tsp curry powder + 1/2 tsp garam masala a pinch of saffron, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne. Instead of chopping & cooking all those vegs, I used a 16 oz pkg mixed frozen vegs instead, which I cooked 1st. I cooked the rice & the frozen vegs with a 1/2 pkg ea of dried onion soup mix. For the chicken, I used dark meat, since white is flavorless. And 2% milk. And no cilantro. Now THIS is a casserole I can live with: it's spicy, deep in flavor, EZ & total yum!

We did not enjoy this at all.

It's easy to fix this recipe--add butter and salt before digging in. Then it'll taste like a Campbell's Soup casserole, with a supposedly hip new Southeast Asian flavor. If I made it again, I'd use celery, mushrooms, parsley, and thyme instead of the cilantro and curry. Note: it filled a 9 X 13 pan.

I would not make this dish again. The texture and flavor were unimpressive and it looked like confetti (kids might like that, though.)

Basic chicken and rice casserole, only mildly tasting of curry if you make it as directed. If you want heat, pump up the spice. Best if you use long grain rice and cook it with a few tablespoons less liquid than usual, so the cooked grains are tender but not sticky. That way they won't get gummy when recooked in the casserole.

I thought this was a great easy recipe that even my 15 month old loved. I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used coriander and I used whole milk instead of skim, plus a little chicken broth. I also added cumin. It was delicious!

This was a great way to use leftover chicken and rice. We had more rice and less chicken than the recipe called for, which gave the dish a more paella-like consistency. The sauce was good, though I ended up straining it to remove some of the smaller lumps. My family gobbled this down and asked for seconds.

I didn't expect much from this dish, but sometimes basic can be good. However, I was unimpressed. I hope it improves after a day or so. I can see why families would like it, though -- easy, cheap and convenient.

It's a bit of a starchy gluey mass. Didn't love it.

Three forks!!! This recipe is really tasty with several additions and changes. First, brown rice was cooked with 2C chicken broth instead of water. Second carrotts, red peppers, onions were sauted in 2T butter for 5 minutes over medium heat then purreed with 1/4 C milk. 1 T butter was melted and flour added-- flour was cooked until brown. The milk was added as directed then the puree was mixed in to the sauce. Frozen mixed peas, carrotts and lima's were mixted in with the chicken and the brown rice. The lemon and chopped parsley was subsutitued for cilantro and stirred into the mixture. After cooking covered for 20 minutes @ 400, lid was remoed and 1C of coconut was sprinkled on top and 1/2 C of sliced almonds. The casserole was put into the oven for the remaining 10 minutes. After removing from the oven, thinly sliced bananas were layered on top. The dinner group thoroughly enjoyed this delicious casserole.

I made it exactly as written and it was awful.

This was OK. My Husband and Kids didn't like it so I found myself eating this for several days. Unfortunately, it tasted best the first day. You could probably find a tastier casserole than this. Only plus - very healthy and easy to make. FYI - I used flavored rice and took the other cooks suggestion and cubed uncooked chicken breast and it cooked fine in the oven - no pink).

This is easy and tasty. I did not use cooked chicken breast but instead put in 1" cubed pieces of raw chicken, which cooked through perfectly in a covered dish in 25 minutes at 400 degrees, (as per the recipe). Also used frozen snow pea pods which cooked through perfectly too, and I liked the texture and taste with these as well.

Delicious and creamy dish. The second time I made it I added other vegetables that we had around the house (broccoli, cauliflower) hey, it's a casserole-- it tastes great how it is or you can make it your own.

I have made this several times. My husband and 5 year old love it. I made it once for a church supper, and am now requested to bring it whenever a hot dish is required. I use semi-skimmed milk and leave out the cilantro because many people don't care for it.

My husband even loved this- healthy dish and all. I substituted the fresh veggies I had in the fridge- cauliflower, green beans, and eggplant, and it still turned out creamy and tasty. I used a little more curry thank called for.

This was yummy, yummy. I made it with carrots and celery and then included steamed cauliflower on the side. Also I used butter instead of oil for making the curry sauce. The whole family liked it and I will be making it again.

My husband and I liked it - but he asked that if it is made again, that I should add more curry. I let the sauce simmer a little too long too, so the dish wasn't as creamy as it should have been. It made for a nice, any day, type dinner - definately not fancy.

In a word, "yuk." Nothing you might try is going to redeem this dish. I let my dog clean the plate, since I couldn't stomach all of it. She normally licks and licks and licks the plate, long after every morsel is gone. In the case of this recipe, she left food on the plate. Don't bother with this one, unless you're looking for something to top off your kitchen trash bag.
