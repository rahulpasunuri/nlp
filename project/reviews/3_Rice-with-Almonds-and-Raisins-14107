This is amazing rice. I used golden raisins instead of dark and substituted low sodium chicken broth for the water and salt. My family always asks for this rice and my sister is constantly calling for the recipe.

The combination of raisins, almonds and butter is almost dessert-like, yet it goes very well with the lemon chicken recipe and other Moroccan-style dishes. It's also good to substitute olive oil for the butter for a different flavour. A keeper for me.

This is a good basic recipe for rice with a little unexpected flair. Substitute any dried fruit and nut- works well with dried cranberry and walnuts, but I can see it working with apricots or prunes too. It was great with the Moroccan Lemon Chicken. Will definitely make it again!

This was nice and it paired well with the Moroccan Chicken. I'm not sure I'd make it alone, but it definitely complemented the chicken well. It does need a final dose of S&P, which reviewers who thought it lacked flavor may have left out.

I cooked the rice in chicken broth and still didn't find it particularly flavourful. I've made it twice now; don't think I'll bother with it again unless I'm in a pinch for a side dish.

Very tasty and easy. I have made it many times. Another mode of rice preparation to keep things interesting. A lovely mix of flavours.

This was a little bland. I would cook with chicken broth next time or use wild rice.

Delicious and so very easy! This is a great side dish for a dinner party - flavorful and very quick to make.

I couldn't find almonds, so used pine nuts instead which were delicious. I think the idea of using chicken stock to cook the rice in is a good one - I wish I'd read this review before I cooked mine in water!

This was fast and great. I was making this ahead of time for a picnic and wound up having it right then for lunch! I used chicken stock instead of water for a fuller taste. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Toasting the almonds are key, don't leave out.
