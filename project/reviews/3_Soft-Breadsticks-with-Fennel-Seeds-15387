Very good bread texture. I used this recipe to make "bones" for Halloween. Cut into 16 pieces, roll into thin long strips, and tie knots at each end. Worked great. Sprinkled with Parm & pepper. Tasty.

These breadsticks are pretty easy to make as long as you have the time. They only take one rise, and they are fun to roll out and shape. They taste pretty good, but they have a tiny bit of an off flavor. The sticks turn out small, so you might want to make them bigger than it says. We left out the fennel and the pepper and they still turned out fine. The recipie does actually make around 45 breadsticks if you make them small. Overall this is a good recipie.
