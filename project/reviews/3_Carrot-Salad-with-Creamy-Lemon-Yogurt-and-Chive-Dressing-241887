Contrary to the recipe, I grated the carrots finely... and enjoyed it a lot!

I thought this was excellent. I used regular, low-fat yogurt and added a little extra honey for sweetness. The result was a slaw-like consistency and taste.

Added 1/4 tsp of cayenne on the advice of previous reviewer, made this a night ahead of a bridal shower luncheon; it was a huge hit. The shower color theme was orange, so this was an extra special treat. The contrast of the green chives was perfect. It is so easy to make now that one can purchase shredded carrots. B.J. Harrick

Yummy. I added a bit of cayenne to give it a little zip.

Instead of the lemon juice I used raspberry vinegar and I left out the chives. I added some salt and black pepper and I stirred the almonds through the salad. It was absolutely delicious next to my Greek meatballs in tomato sauce.

Thanks to other reviewers, I tweaked this. With the tweaks, it was quite good. Here's what I did: reduce lemon juice to 2 teaspoons, substitute 3 T. mayonnaise for the olive oil, add a touch of garlic, and don't be shy with the salt! I used Fage 2% greek yogurt. Big Yum! Served with indian spiced lamb chops and naan from Trader Joes.

I have to agree. I should have read the reviews before making this. I am going to tinker with the recipe. Maybe more honey and some sour cream to thicken it? It is just missing something. Perhaps lemon zest?

Hmmm-I have to agree with most. I just made it without having read the reviews and need to do something to tweak the recipe.Maybe more honey? Lemon zest? I might throw in some sour cream to thicken it up.

I made this for Easter dinner. I didn't like it, and judging by the plates that came back with nearly a whole serving of carrot salad, neither did my guests. I will not make this again.

yeah, it's pretty bad.

NO forks. Yuck, gross. No one would touch it. I ate a bit and found it sour due to the yogurt and lemon juice. It's not a sweet slaw, I know, but this was terrible.

I really loved this recipe. It was fast and everyone I served it to loved it.

I would definitely not make this again. I've never encountered such a bomb of a recipe on Epicurious before. Part of the problem is the name. Rather than a "salad," it's more like a slaw, really, which could be ok, I guess, but the carrots and yogurt don't taste good together (at all) and the whole thing is a very unappetizing pink/orange color. I'm not even going to serve it.
