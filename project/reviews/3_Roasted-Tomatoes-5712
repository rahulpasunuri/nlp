The tomatoes were a bit too juicy for me. Next time I would slice them thinner. I expected them to be dryer hence the name "roasted". Wonderful taste, though!

This is a delicious and easy recipe. I used it for a side dish, served warm. Also, I left out the thyme and added a few drops of balsamic vinegar.
