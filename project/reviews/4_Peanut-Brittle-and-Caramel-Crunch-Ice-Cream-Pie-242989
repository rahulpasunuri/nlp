I made this for my mom's birthday. She claims to hate sweet stuff so I was looking for a salty dessert and this was the perfect marriage of salty and sweet! After reading the reviews, I used Hershey's Caramel sauce in the glass jar and added 1/4 teaspoon of crushed sea salt for every 1/2 cup of caramel. (This was the best caramel I've ever had and will never go back to regular unsalted!) It was not nearly as difficult as I had expected after that and soooooo good. My mom is still talking about the "Only dessert she'll eat" and my husband polished off the fourth left over after her party in a couple of days! This is for sure going in my favorite desserts repertoire!

The day I made this pie, I was already preparing my review about how labor-intense this pie was, and not that exciting taste-wise. I was amazed tonight, when I served this to guests, to find that the flavors had married, and a little distance from the effort made it all very worth it. That said, I will take a few shortcuts next time--I will not make the caramel sauce with white sugar, nor will I buy it as other reviewers have done. The best happy, easy method is to do a quick caramel sauce with brown sugar and cream--there are many recipes on the internet for various versions that do not require caramelizing the sugar and stirring for 12 minutes (which did not yield the necessary dark amber color for me required for the sauce as per this recipe--I had to re-do the sauce using the quick brown sugar version). I will also use a spring form pan and I question whether the extra steps with the foil and the crust are necessary--I think I will try just pressing the crust into a spring form pan and moving forward without foil. It is an exquisite dessert--and does not have to be a trial to make. I think my next experience will be just as good and far happier.

Delicious and so pretty! Didn't have peanut brittle so used chocolate covered toffee instead. Wonderful, everyone asked for seconds. Will definitely make again with toffee.

Hi, I have a question: when people made this with store bought caramel sauce, did you still add the cream and sea salt mixture to the sauce?

We loved this pie! Thanks to the advice from others, I used a 9" springform pan, and patted the crust in the bottom and up the sides. I also used purchased carmel topping and melted peanut butter so that it could be drizzled. Not sure how closely you need to follow all the freezing directions - I just gave it a best guess and the pie turned out great. Will definitely make again!

I made this for dinner at a friend's house. Her daughter, notoriously picky about her desserts asked for seconds and everyone else raved about it. I used Dreyers light ice cream, which lightened it a bit.

This was excellent!! I used the springform pan which another reviewer suggested. I just tin-foiled the bottom piece and didn't bother taking the crust out of the pan and putting it back. Also, I too couldn't imagine this without chocolate so used vanilla chocolate fudge brownie as the ice cream. Lastly, I didn't have a vanilla bean so just used 1 tsp vanilla instead. This is a new favorite!!

Was excellent. Made it for a party of 25. Bought caramel sauce to save time. Also, tried many ways to drizzle peanut butter and found the answer with Reese's Peanut Butter sauce.

My daughter said, "yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!" I think she liked it.

Fairly easy. I liked the peanut butter it made for great flavor and texture. I actually made it a second time but used macadamia rather than peanuts which I preferred.

for cook from NJ, the natural kind is very runny when not refrigerated. drizzles very easily.

How does one "drizzle" creamy peanut butter? Heat it first?

was unsure on this as there is no chocolate :-), but we never missed it. absolutely delicious. plan for plenty of time - not a ton of effort, just a lot of freezing. and as previous reviewer mentioned, a deep dish pie pan is better for the full recipe.

Forgot to say that I used a springform pan instead of the pie plate, which made for a nicer presentation.

Yum! I did not make the caramel sauce as I was short on time. But the crust and flavor combos were delish!

This was SO good! Well worth all the in and out of the freezer! The ice cream I used was Hagen Daz Creme Brulee so I made the caramel a bit darker amber than called for since the swirls in the ice cream are a bit of a burnt caramel (but not TOO much). Also, I dutifully used the 9" pie plate rather than my 9 1/2", deeper pan. I found when I put in the first layer of 1.5 pints of ice cream, the pan was pretty much full! The pie, therefore, was a one layer with all the peanut brittle, peanut butter (didn't have natural-style so I just warmed the crunchy that I had in the microwave to the point it would drizzle) and most of the caramel sauce on top. It was incredible just as it was, and I will definitely make it again with just the one layer which was plenty rich! Served 8 with servings appropriate to the rich "yummyness" of all the ingredients. Definitely a family fave!
