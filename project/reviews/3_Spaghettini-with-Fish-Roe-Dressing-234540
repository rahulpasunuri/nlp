I make this simple and delicious dish all the time. In Harumi's book featuring this recipe she says that kombu cha is hard to find and can be substituted with a strong fish stock -- I use Hon-dashi benito fish stock.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used a little bit less mentaiko, about 2 1/2 ounces and 9 ounces of spaghetti not spaghettini but the flavors are wonderful.

To remove the skin of the spicy fish roe, cut the top half of the roe length wise (dont cut it through). Hold the left side with your left fingers and use your knife to scrape out the fish eggs.

Ive eaten many a mentaiko spaghetti so this wasnt anything special but the taste is as good as others I have had. It may be a good first-time menu for someone who has never tried it. Scraping out the mentaiko (spicy fish roe) may be difficult to do and look at the first time around.
