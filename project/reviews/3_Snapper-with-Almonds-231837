This was nothing short of spectacular and ridiculously easy! Used half of the butter and no olive oil. Was still rich and delicious. My date was very impressed.

I found this dish to be quite tasty and quick to make. There was no exotic taste explosion, but everything melded together for a mellow, non-overwhelming dinner.

Quite good and easy. Delicate flavor. We used dill instead of parsley.

One fork means "just so-so" & I think that's an apt description of this recipe. The toasted almonds are great but almost overwhelm the dish because overall it's so bland. I used wine to deglaze the pan as suggested below, but the recipe still could use some herbs or spices for flavor.

I added 1/4 cup dry white wine to deglaze the pan, and topped with green beans (steamed then sauteed with garlic and olive oil). This dish was quick, simple, and absolutely delicious. Not fishy at all!

I think that dish needs to be renamed from Snapper with Almonds to Bachelor on a date. It's edible, tasty even, but it lacks the sensory explosion that should come with good snapper. The great news is that it only takes about ten minutes to make.

Simple but tasty. Not very high on flavor, though.

SIMPLE. THIS ENTREE MAKES A GREAT LIGHT DINNER. I SERVED STEAMED ASPARAGUS WITH THIS.
