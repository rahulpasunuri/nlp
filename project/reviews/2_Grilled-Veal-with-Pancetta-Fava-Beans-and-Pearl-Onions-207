I'm not sure what the person before me thought was strange but I thought it was delicious. I used fava beans but you need to peel them so I would blanch them first. Peeling after it has arrowroot on them is slippery. I loved the marjoram in it.

This was a mighty strange taste, I'll tell you. I'm not sure if it was the lima beans (I couldn't get my hands on fava beans) or the marjoram with the onions, but it was very odd. It wasn't BAD, but it definitely lacked something and I can't even imagine what it might be. My personal opinion, don't waste your time.
