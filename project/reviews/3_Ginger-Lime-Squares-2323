My family really loved these bars. They were very easy, quick and delicious. I took the other reviews about not having enough of the filling and doubled the amount except for the sugar which I made 1 1/4 cups instead of 1 1/2 cups. I thought it was the perfect amount of filling. It was almost as thick as the crust which I used walnuts in because we were out of pecans. Great recipe!

I don't know if the difference between this being a success for the other reviewers and my experience was using fresh lime juice. I used bottled 100% key lime juice from Williams-Sonoma. I had to throw mine away.

Never eat lemon bars again! These are very unique squares and I've been making them each summer since they were first published in Bon Appetit. I agree with the first review that the filling could be thicker though. If you are looking for a green tint, add a wee bit of food coloring. Don't be put off by the candied crystalized ginger- it's inexpensive and found in the Asian food section.

Really good, I especially liked the crust. I increased the lime and ginger...to give them a bit more flavor. Would recommend baking in a smaller pan to make the custard part a bit thicker....will definitely make them again.
