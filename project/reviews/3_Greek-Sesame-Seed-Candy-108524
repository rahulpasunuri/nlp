I have to agree with the cook from Bellevue--be careful of scorching, especially towards the end. That said the flavor was excellent. However, I only gave it two forks because it was just too sticky for my taste. I would make it again, but cook it to a higher temperature/hard crack for a crunchier candy.

Really great candy, just like the store-bought version. Be sure to use a thick-bottomed pot. I used a thin pan and the sesame seeds at the bottom were a bit scorched.

We love sesame candy and I was quite happy to see that I might not have to purchase it anymore and I was right. The key here is in the quality of the honey used. Next time I make this I will add an extra half cup of sesame seeds though. We did think the amount called for a bit skimpy.
