This actually was delicious. I cubed the swordfish, and spiked each one with a sprig of rosemary, then marinaded, and cooked them. I took a punnet of tiny tomatoes, sliced and marinated for ten minutes in a teaspoon of balsamic, one finely minced garlic clove, touch of olive oil, salt and pepper. I also used a lot more potatoes than suggested, and extra olives. I also made a greater quantity of the vinaigrette. It was spectacular.

This just seemed like it was missing something...but I don't know what. Maybe a different marinade would have been better...or add some tomatoes? Swordfish is always a winner, but this recipe just isn't. I'd skip it, or modify it if you do try it.

I liked this recipe but wasn't anything unusual. I blanched the green beans like it said but I like mine cooked alittle more. Next time I would cook them longer. Also, did the swordfish on the George Forman grill. That worked fine. Followed his cooking time recommendation but the fish was alittle dry. Next time I would cook them for about 8 min. instead of 9 or 10
