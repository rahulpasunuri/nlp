I made these with small chocolate chunks and flaked almondsin place of the pinenuts and marsala fruit combo - I just used what was on hand. The chocolate and almonds are a good flavor combo. Nice cookie to have on hand for tea or coffee.

easy to prepare and have a lovely, satisfying, sophisticated-yet-hearty flavor. a favorite. the first time i made them i substituted red wine for the marsala and they were still delicious. another time i accidentally over-processed the nut mixture. the cookies came out hard and crunchy- good with ice cream, but i'll limit processing time in the future.

these were really excellent - chewy, nutty, satisfying. I used dried cherries instead of dried currants. They were simple to make. I gave them out as Christmas gifts and everyone loved them!
