I'm making this tonight and will review later, but I wanted to mention that if you want to cut back on the salt and brininess of the capers, just give them a good rinse and drain well before adding them to a recipe.

Good, quick and easy. Warning, though: VERY salty. If you are not a heavy salter yourself, go easy on the added salt. The capers make it salty enough. However, I like this and have made it twice.

Very delicious and very easy. Make a bit of extra sauce, because it's great for dipping! Love the recipe. Have made it twice already.

Followed the recipe to a T. A delicious and simple dish to prepare. This dish channels chicken piccata (depending on how big thick a piece of chicken you use) in that it has the capers and zingy acidity provided by way of citrus. As another reviewer said, pairs well with mash (brown butter?).

Good, my husband says "very good". Definitely fast. To my taste, too SALTY! -- will definitely back off on the added salt next time. I used boneless skinless whole chicken breasts, which required significantly more time than the cutlets would have to cook, but were still tasty.

I wasn't that impressed by the briny/fennel flavors. Came together like a heavy mustard taste, to me.

We followed the recipe as written and it was excellent. We served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

This was so delicious! My husband doesn't like capers either but he didn't mention anything about this dish except that it was really good. I served it with the spiced basmati rice.

You know, this is a quick and tasty recipe, and it was a piece of cake to prepare. (I spent more time watching the rice). I chose this recipe to clean the pantry of OJ, fennel, and an aging jar of capers. Despite not being a fan of capers, I was very pleasantly surprised. My other half doesn't like the idea of serving chicken to company; however, unprovoked he said this would be great for a dinner for friends. I prepared exactly per the instructions.

Oh wow. For the effort this is magnificent. The only substitution I made is I used boneless-skinless chicken thighs, because my family prefers dark meat portions. Not as health-conscious, but definitely tastes good. But if you're using that much butter, who cares? I was worried the ground fennel would be overpowering, but it's not! It's great with the OJ and capers. What an unlikely combination that makes a great dish that we will make again regularly. Served it with some basmati rice that we had on hand, and some veggies. SO EASY

This recipe was surprisingly delicious! It was quite easy to prepare and quickly became one of my family's favorites! I did not chop the capers and I honestly don't think that it made a bit of difference.
