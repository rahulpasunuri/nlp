Nothing special. Good intro to chayote for a first timer. Will look for other recipes next time for chayote.

A little bland, but overall a good recipe with nice mellow flavor.

I used olive oil to veganize the dish, and it was still superb. The chayote was sweet and crisp and with the garlic, it provided a deliciously mellow dish. I served this with black beans, spanish rice, and a cilantro-dressed slaw. I'm going to make it again tonight!

Really tasty! The chayote is so crisp and sweet. Plus, the goodness of butter.

This easily cooked to a perfect crisp-tender stage. It has a nice delicate butter-garlic flavor. We had it with the red pea bisque with rum flambe, guava-stuffed chicken with caramelized mango, sweet potato, onion, and apple gratin, and rum raisin ice cream.
