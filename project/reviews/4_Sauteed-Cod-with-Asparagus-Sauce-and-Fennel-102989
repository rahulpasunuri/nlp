Simple, elegant, very pretty. I also added a squeeze of lime and a bit of dijon mustard to the sauce. (Thanks to the cook from sacto!) This was just lovely with a simple tossed salad. I will make often. I wonder how it would be with artichoke hearts rather than asparagus?

Sauce was a bit flat so added a tsp or so of lemon juice and a a bit of dijon mustard, brightened up nicely, also ground about 1/2 tsp of fennel seed and added to the sauce instead of whole, best cod dish I've mede yet!

Excellent with the following modifications: Did not use butter; I wanted to make the dish as healthy as possible. Instead used a tablespoon of olive oil in the puree as well as some olive oil to sautée the asparagus stalks as well as some shallots, garlic and pine nuts that I added to the puree.

We love this recipe. Luckily, we are able to get fresh cod in rhode island. Combined with the asparagus, and a baked squash (acorn or butternut) with brown sugar and (with or without bacon), the combination is quite nice, especially in the Fall. And both are VERY easy and very quick to make. Just be sure to follow the epicurious times for cooking cod. It is spot on. Too much longer, and it gets dry quickly. Too soon and it is not quite ready. We do it about once a week, as a local standby.

Wonderful sauce, I added a little lemon pepper to the sauce and the fish and it was fantastic. I'ld leave the fennel out the next time. It overpowers the meal.

I've made this recipe many times and have always received many compliments about the sauce. This sauce is also excellent over rice and other vegetables.

I used this spears and did not peel the stalks. I compensated by slightly overcooking them. By making the sauce in advance, the actual preparation time, after company arrived, was basically cooking the fish. The dish is quite colorful which adds to the great taste. This is a good dish which is also healthy.
