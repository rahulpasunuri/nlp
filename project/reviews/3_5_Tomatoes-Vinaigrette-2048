Very refreshing and low calorie. Made exactly as the recipe is written the first time then made it using 1/2 Tbsp of olive oil and fresh oregano. At serving time I drained it and did a light sprinkling of feta and crumbled bacon. Delicious!

I'm sure this is a nice recipe for June...but it is listed under Valentine's day Menus as well...tomatoes in February...uh...ok.

This was good, but not amazing as written. Adding fresh mozzarella and basil of course makes it better :)

This is my recipe from Bon Appetit a long time (and different last name) ago. My mother used to serve it as a side dish with Dolphin Almandine and wild rice. We did not drain the tomatoes (left them soupy) and the original recipe did not call for olive oil. Bon Appetit added that. Hope you enjoy it! Gina

Depends how you like your tomato salads and with what you are serving it with. It is important to add olives (if you like them)as well as the mozz cheese cubes. Sometimes a little more sugar goes a long way. If you like it spicy add some hot peppers (hot). It depends on your taste!

Yum! No need for the oil, this is great without it. A good quality vinegar really makes this salad fab.

This is so good. I used about 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil instead of parsley, and like another reviewer suggested I added fresh mozzarella.

This recipe was really nice, I added fresh mozzarella and left some over night in the fridge, which made it even better! Give it some time to soak and it more blended...

This was a great side to a beef roast I made on mothers day. I din't use the oil, however, and think that it does need it. Otherwise the vinegar flavor is too powerful. But a great side nonetheless.

I thought this recipe was great. I added crumbled Feta Cheese to it. I ate it just like that. Next I'm going to try mixing it in some rice or couscous.

This is a delisous dish, however try adding a little fresh chopped garlic and some fresh basil.

A great way to show off homegrown heirloom tomatoes. I added crumbled feta cheese to my brandywines - delicious!

Delicious with cilantro instead of or in addition to the parsley.

Finally a great vinaigrette dressing!!! I use this vinaigrette for ALL salads. It's also a great marinade for bbq dishes. Not surprisingly, another winner!
