I made this recipe with a few minor changes and thought it was very good. Based on a few of the reviews, I wanted to make sure I had enough liquid for the sauce. First, I boiled the potatoes and pasta in lightly salted water, then reserved about a cup of the cooking liquid to use in case the sauce seemed too dry. In addition, I used a little extra wine and veggie broth. A pinch extra red pepper, and fresh rosemary instead of dried, and I had a delicious, almost-vegetarian dinner. It would still be good without the prosciutto. I'll try this next time.

This is an excellent recipe, and like someone said previously, perfect on a cold spring day. I made some modifications to this recipe as I saw fit, since I am a vegetarian. I cooked the potatoes until almost done, but not quite. I cooked the potatoes a bit longer when adding the peas to the rest of the ingredients, and then addedsherry vinegar instead of dry white wine, and vegetable broth. I increased the garlic and herbs, and used regular fettuccine, and topped it with some nutty parmesan. I learned not to question the use of potatoes when I had a slice of potato and rosemary pizza (no sauce, and almost no cheese) by this Italian baker. It definitely opened up a new realm of possibilities.

This was an interesting twist on pasta. The potatoes and whole-wheat pasta do give it a heavier texture but I liked it and would make it.

I made this recipe to please my son - the king of carbohydrates. He didn't like it at all. The rest of the family found it unremarkable.

We enjoy this recipe a lot, and I've made it many times since it was first published in 1990. It's a very generous recipe, so for 4 people I always cut it in half.

I would normally never add potatoes to pasta, but this recipe has taught me something. I doubled the amount of garlic in the recipe and will make this again when we can afford the carbs. This is an outstanding pasta for cold spring day.

The taste is excellent!!Advice:I cooked the potatoes longer than indicated on the recipe. Make sure to cook them really well because it tastes much better when the potatoes get mashed up with the pasta then if they are whole. The texture of the two together and the spices are wonderful!! I also used spinach fettucine and it was great too!! Highly recommended!!
