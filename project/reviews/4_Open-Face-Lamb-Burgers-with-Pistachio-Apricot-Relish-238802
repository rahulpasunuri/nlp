I loved this recipe. I had some grass fed, organic lamb & wanted to do something special with it. As suggested, I used mango since apricots weren't in season. I made a little bit extra of the relish since one reviewer said they used it as a side, it was amazing. I will absolutely make this again.

This recipe was fantastic! I substituted mango for the apricots (which weren't in season) and everyone loved it. I actually ran out of relish because I was being eaten as a side item, too.

I was looking for a way to use the copious amount of mint in my garden and happened upon this. Sounded interesting so we gave it a whirl (and my spouse was not optimistic) but it was wonderful! It turns out that our roasted jarred red peppers had gone off, so we had to omit, but I loved it without them. Couldn't find pistachios without salt, so omitted salting the apricot mixture. This is a definite keeper - absolutely wonderful!

I wanted to try this flavor combination, but I have celiac disease, so I adapted the recipe to be gluten-free using rice. I made the lamb burgers as written, but put all the ingredients for the relish except the onion in a pot with 2 cups of white rice and 4 cups of water and cooked like any pot of rice. I put a scoop of the rice mixture on each plate, topped with a burger, and topped that with the raw onion.

This surprised us - it was better than expected. I used mango instead of apricots, and only had pecans, but the salsa was delicious and really complimented the lamb burgers (as did the fruity Spanish red we had alongside...). So, while not something you could eat weekly, it was a very pleasant change of pace. However, I do think you need to be a lamb lover.
