we invested in a quarter of a grass fed cow so I'm using some cuts I haven't in the past. Great chuck recipe as an alternative to stew.

I'm really giving this one 4 forks because of the simplicity and the great variations given by other reviewers. I also didn't have any bacon on hand, so went the butter/olive oil route. Because I made it in the height of Farmer's Market season I used a couple of long green smoky peppers from my CSA (a couple of poblano's would be great as well) and 2 or so cups of assorted tomatoes. The result was fantastic. Will definitley be keeping this one in mind for a winter variation with canned tomatoes and red wine. Also thanks to another reviewer I'll file it with the potato recipe also from Edna Lewis in the January 2008 Gourmet(so glad these are still available and easy to search)!!!

My first chuck steak. My husband, for whom it was not a first, was less than thrilled by the prospect. We had fun pounding it with the handle end of a steel blade (we do not own a mallet... yet) and we used beef broth and red wine as recommended. (But did not add oil to the bacon as this felt like way too much fat). It was a weeknight and we decided to eat it after 50 minutes of simmering. It would have been wonderful after 1h14m but, this felt quite beautiful, sort of like a busy woman's beef bourguignon. Would make it again - but let it cook longer.

Can't help it. I always try t maximize flavor with whatever I have on hand. This time, I didn't have bacon, so I used olive oil and butter instead. After browning the meat, I browned some mushrooms and after the onions I added garlic. For the water, I used a can of diced tomatoes. At the end I sprinked finely chopped parsley and lemon zest (gremolata without the garlic!) Yummmmmm!!

Great base recipe, but cooked as written, it's really bland. I've made this with and without bacon and both ways are just as good. When I don't have bacon, I add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste while sauteeing the onions for more depth of flavor. And as recommened by others, I usually add about 1/4 cup of red wine in addition to the water for more flavor. I use Chuck- eye steak for this recipe, which is a fairly tender cut, but braising it makes it fork tender. Overall, I add more salt to the onions and sauce before simmering. I accompany this with Eggplant Mashed Potatoes (add roasted eggplant to normal mashed potatoes - divine!) and have served it to company. I always receive rave reviews. A comforting, simple, classic winter dish. Add a salad and good crusty bread to soak up the gravy and you're good to go.

Great - for what it is. Have made twice & will make again. Made shallow slices across gristle in middle of steaks on both sides to prevent curling. Used broth instead of water & added 1/3 C red wine. Nice with green veggie.

I made this yesterday because I had a thawed chuck steak center cut. I did add a little red wine as suggested. I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic because we love garlic! It still could have had a bit more intensity. I did trim away all fat, which tends to impart (unhealthy!) flavor. If I do try it again, I will be sure to get the best quality chuck I can find. I used Giant brand, which is high on value but low on quality. I would also not shake away any flour at dredging , rather pile it on! Also, I will try marinating first in olive oil, garlic and wine. Oh, and I will make 6 slices of bacon and recrisp it before crumbling...

This is delicious home-cooking. You do need to be generous w/ the salt and pepper. If you know someone that loves gravy, this is the recipe for them.

OK, I'll try it one more time. It's tender, but as written it's very blnad. Needs more salt and pepper at very least,

My husband and I truly enjoyed this. It was delicious and very comforting. It is a great example of a terrific meal made from a cheaper cut of meat.

Great recipe, the potato recipe (same article in Gourmet) was a perfect compliment. The 1/3 cup wine addition sounds like a good idea as my gravy reduced a bit too much with the recommended amount of liquids.

This was a great comfort food recipe, just as written. The combination with the potato casserole made these recipes instant family favorites.

Very good, and easy to make. I also added red wine (1/2 c), and would do so again.

This was very good, but not going to give it 4 forks. The meat was very tender and it did make a nice gravy, but felt it needed a little more flavor. I think the red wine suggestion may be what it needed. It was time consuming, so it's not something I would make frequently. I did make the potato dish and it was super easy and tasted wonderful!

Very nice. I added 1/3 cup of red wine.

Perfect comfort food for a cold January day. I have been using Miss Lewis' recipes for many years and have never been disappointed. Her cooking proves that simple food, simply and intelligently prepared transcends time and place in a way that few things can.

Had some Oryx round steak I needed to use up so tried this. It is so simple, yet so flavorful! I wasnt' sure if just the water and onion would be enough for a flavorful gravy to develop...boy was I wrong...it was so rich! I skipped the bacon and it was still fantastic. The leftovers were even better the next day. Try this, you won't be disappointed!

So delicious! I will be making this again and again...and then heading to the gym afterwards!

I made this today to take to a friend's home for the Pittsburgh playoff game (along with the potato casserole) and it was an absolute rave!!! I hesitated to use hte bacon grease for cooking the meat, but knew it would be the thing to make the steaks so great. Boy am I glad I stuck to the recipe. Magnificent!
