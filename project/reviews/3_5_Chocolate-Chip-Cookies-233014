I have rheumatoid arthritis and wheat is a trigger food for me. This is just the best. I detest brown rice flour, but noted that it was brown rice flour MIX. I used 1 cup Domata Gluten Free, Casein Free all purpose flour, 1 cup Quinoa flour and 2 T Pamela's Baking mix. Perfect texture. I added Rice Krispies into the last half, and got a lighter crispier cookie,and white chocolate chunks added to the semisweet chocolate was another great addition.

I'm gluten intolerant and have made this recipe at least a dozen times, experimenting with ingredients each time. I haven't tried the palm oil yet that someone suggested, but will. In the best batch I've made so far, I did use Crisco and used Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour instead of the brown rice flour mix.

excellent wheat-free cookie! my son (who is extremely picky) really loves them. using the right flour (finely ground brown rice flour from authentic foods) is key.

i tried this recipe because i am not eating gluten. i ate them with people who have no problems with gluten and people loved them and asked for the recipe. also, i do not consume hydrogenated oils and so i used Spectrum organic vegetable shortening which is naturally solid at room temp. as it's made from palm oil. you don't have to use crisco or another unhealthy product for this recipe.

My brother can't eat any products containing gluten, a real problem during Christmas cookie time. I became so excited when I saw this recipe. I made these cookies along side my traditional, all-purpose flour chocolate chip cookies, using butter in both. The rice flour dough was more elastic, but the cookies baked up wonderfully. They taste better than the traditional ones. If I didn't know already, I'd never guess they weren't made with wheat flour.

I made these for my mother who can't eat wheat. I used butter instead of Crisco and I used Bette's Gourmet Featherlight Rice Flour Blend from Authentic Foods. These cookies were surprisingly good. They are not as "cakey" as flour cookies - more crispy, but I agree that most would have a tough time guessing they were made without flour. This is an amazing find for those with wheat allergies.

I disagree - I think there's every reason to try something different whether you can eat gluten or not. These were very light and crispy. Good!

to "A Cook From Fairport" I guess you don't get it. Those of us who can't eat gluten can't "stick with Nestle Toll House" because that recipe has flour. Of course, if you CAN eat wheat or gluten there's probably no reason to make this recipe.

Use coconut oil or palm oil - NOT crisco. Different shortenings offer a different crumb, all butter wouldn't give these the same texture.

Stick with Nestle Toll House. Butter is better. Why wrap your chocolate chips in nasty crisco? Yuck.
