I had three ears of leftover corn that had been roasted, so I used that for a half recipe. I used a half poblano pepper, which gave the recipe more hotness than I first expected. Instead of garnishing with whole leaves of cilantro, I sliced ribbons of cilantro. When they fell onto the hot soup they gave the most delicious aroma. Happily, it ended up the perfect degree of hotness from the poblanos, because the cilantro in ribbons added a cooling effect. The soup was way better than I thought it'd be.

I made this after an overly enthusiastic corn purchase at the farmers market. Very good.

I followed earlier reviews and used bagged frozen sweet corn and was very pleased with the results. Its a great excuse to use my hand held immersion blender instead of processor. Used one anaheim chili and a little more broth and less milk.

I leave the milk out but it's just wonderful! I always make this with the Black Bean Soup with Cumin and Jalapeno (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/109772) laddled side by side. Beautiful paired together and fast to make!

Definitely use yellow corn, and use clear-or-yellow ingredients for everything else. I made the mistake of using a red onion and it looked brown at the end. But the taste was great!

we use New Mexico roasted hatch chiles and it really adds a depth of flavor both spice and smoke to the soup that makes it really special...this is easy and we do it over and over again.

Delicious! Have always used frozen corn unless I have cob leftovers. Only recommended change is using yellow corn - white produced soup with an unappetizing grayish tint.

I grated the corn per the suggestions of a couple earlier reviews, but this didn't eliminate the need to puree in processer due to other chunks (onion...). The soup was therefore a lot of work (I doubled it) and not great at all. I used 2 jalapenos and still could taste them not at all. Perhaps my corn was too sweet? It was very sweet. Anyway, hate to be the odd woman out, but this just wasn't the "wow" soup I was hoping for.

Lovely! This was time consuming because I tripled the recipe for a big crowd but them had a lot of shucking and shedding of the kernels to do. It was so good though and I only added about 1 cup of milk. Wasnt even necessary.

This recipe was so easy to prepare and most of the ingredients are already on hand! I will most certainly be making this again!

Excellent soup, cilantro adds a nice freshness. Use half cream and half milk to make the soup smoother.

I keep coming back to this recipe - I've made it several times and it never disappoints. It is easy, low-fat and delicious.

I used one jalepeno pepper and found it to be the perfect level of spiciness. I thought the amount of cumin suggested in the recipe was fine. I did, however, need to use a little more oil to keep the onion etc. from scorching.

I used an Anaheim pepper from the garden and the soup just didn't have the 'umph' I wanted. So, I added a serrano pepper and then it had a little too much 'umph'! A little too hot for me, but hey that was my fault - otherwise, it was a very good soup & easy to prepare.

At first, I found the recipe a bit bland, but with the addition of some chili flakes (next time, I'll just use a stronger chili) and some more cumin, it was perfect! I'll definitely be making this again.

I used one jalepeno pepper, but would add more next time, as well as more cumin. A touch of my "Scorned Woman" hot sauce spiced it up nicely. I thought about a cup of milk was plenty. I added the juice of one lime, and it gave this soup a bright freshness.

I made this twice in the past week to rave reviews. So fresh and seasonally delicious. The first time I used half a jalapeno instead of another pepper, and the second time an Anaheim. Couldn't really tell the difference -- I'll do an entire jalapeno next time if I want it spicy.

Quite simple and delicious. Perfect summer dish.

I made this soup as an appetizer for a dinner party of eight. I added 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and sliced sausage links. It received good reviews. It improves with age, so I would make it 24 hours in advance and reheat before serving.

I thought the soup came out a little bland. I have to say that grating the corn made the whole process a lot quicker and it made the base much richer.

This recipe is good, fresh tasting and easy to make. The poblano gives it just the right amount of zing.

BRAVO~~!!

We loved this receipe, it was easy and not too time consuming. I followed the comments of a previous reviewer and grated in the corn. This also speeded up the process. Will make it again

Great recipe. Just as good with day old corn - I only used half the amount of corn and about 1/2Cup milk. A pinch of cumin suffices. don't skimp on the jalapeno or other hot pepper. Gets better with age.

I've made a similar soup, but instead of cooking the corn and then pureeing, I like to grate the corn for a more intense flavor. I also like to garnish with corn kernels roasted with cumin and chiles as well as some fresh diced tomatoes for color.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made it with white corn which was a little sweeter but it was still great.
