Absolutely delicious! Our 'diet' version was made with fat-free half and half, and reduced fat sour cream. We also had to omit the croutons, but it was still amazing.

This was a lovely first course for a Mother's Day lunch. The croutons were the highlight of the soup... don't skip them! I used fresh dill instead of chives, and subbed yogurt for some of the dairy. Otherwise followed recipe, it was great!

I made this with the basic ingredients available in my kitchen - that means no sesame oil, sesame seeds, chives or croutons, and I substituted onion for leek. This is the first true recipe that I have attempted to make via Epicurious, and the first soup using a blender that I have EVER tried. Even without the 'exotic' ingredients I missed, the result was so deliciously successful that I am game to try anything on this site from now on. You have won a fan in me, Epicurious!!!!!

Sooooo Good. I used half & half and low fat sour cream instead of whipping cream and full fat sour cream and it was fantastic! Can't wait to serve this to company.

This is truly special. I've made it twice, both times for company. Both times, I got follow-up requests for the recipe. An entertaining staple.

I thought this was excellent. I made it the night before and it had great flavor. I used organic carrots, and followed the recipe exactly. Not as healthy as the winter vegetable soup w/ the maple syrup and cayenne on this site that I like so much, but definitely very good.

When made with fresh from your garden carrots there is no comparison! Outstanding first course.

The only carrot soup recipe I have ever liked. If you like sesame oil, this recipe is a keeper. For a lower fat version, simply simmer the vegetables until tender, skip the croutons and use 1 cup fat free sour cream instead of 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup sour cream.

I left out the sesame seeds & oil and added 2 poblano chilis sauted with the carrots. Really tasty, plus the poblano left tiny green bits throughout the soup. Very attractive!

Very easy to make and delicious! The sesame flavor goes well with the carrots. I made this to accompany our Thanksgiving meal and everyone loved it.

Was looking for something with lots of vitamins - found it here! But don't go serving it in large soup bowls (ie: 2 portions!!) - it can sit quite heavy. Enjoyable, but the taste more or less grew dull once the bowl got half empty - I recommend serving this as a lovely, colourful entree. And I added lots of pepper - it was salty enough from the boullion.

I went searching for a recipe to use up a lot of carrots from the summer garden. Out of 1100 carrot receipes I picked the best one. I left out the sesame oil, I don't care for it. Also left out the leeks, and the salt & pepper. This is a wonderfull soup. My husband kept repeating to himself. " This soup is gooood", as he was eating. And easy to make. Will be making this one many times I'm sure.

This soup was a hit with our dinner group. Easy to make and wonderful texture. Did not find the sesame oil gave it a 'musty" flavor as another mentioned. Would suggest using the blanched (white) pepper as opposed to black; much better presentation without the specks.

This was very easy. I used store bought croutons, but sauteed them in the oil with the sesame seeds and that worked well. 8 carrots made 3.5 cups for me.

This soup is wonderful! A great mixture of flavors for a soup that most often is rather bland. My guests raved.

This is an amazing recipe...easy to make and the velvety texture is wonderful. For those of you who are watching the calories...I used half and half with a bit of homogonized mild instead of whipping cream and low fat sour cream instead of full fat. Just as good as the original version. I will be making this one again for sure.

The sesame oil was too odd a flavor for this soup. It tasted musty. Leave it out for a better soup.
