Boring, Boring, Boring!!! I tried this recipe to utilize my fresh bell peppers and garlic from the local CSA. I made the pesto with basil from my garden and was so excited to have a locavore experience. What a disappointment! The flavors were bland, the pesto was the best part, but I was looking for a WOW like other reviews. Ended up using the leftover pepper blend with pasta the next night and added some red pepper flakes to the dish. Much better. If you really want a bruschetta recipe, try the pesto with a slice of smoked mozzerella and some parma ham - yummy!

I really liked this and made it a day in advance but liked it hot better than room temp. When I make this again I'll heat the peppers up before assembling. Fun and easy recipe and got huge thumbs up at my party!

This was a great side dish/appetizer. It worked well with pre-made pesto sauce. The flavor works great together and the color adds a lot to the artistic aspect of the meal. I made the pepper mix a day ahead and spread the pesto mix on the bread directly which worked great. I will make this again for sure!!

I'm in love. This recipe is fantastic and I've made it many times now. Agree with other reviewers that it's better when the veggies are sliced thinner. The pesto recipe can be modified per your own taste. I also added some red pepper flakes to the peppers early on and it had a nice little zing. Breads were done in a minute on a hot grill and I used a whole grain loaf from Trader's for more health benefits. Keeper!!

Beautiful appetizer. Guests at my xmas party loved it. I finely chopped the peppers and onions. Was easier to spoon on the tosts. Used shallots - they were great.

This is a great make-ahead appetizer. Such a nice change from basic tomato bruschetta. Definatly worth the effeort to make the pesto instead of store bought. I made the pesto and peppers the day before.

This was excellent. Everyone loved it and my mom even stole the recipe to make for her work holiday party. I didn't have time to make the fresh pesto, so I used a store-bought one. But the combination of peppers, onion, and pesto is an incredibly tasty pairing. The minimal effort this required was just a welcomed bonus.

Super easy and delicious. Make sure to use quality bread

This is terrific. I used a good store bought pesto, and made the peppers and onions a day ahead. I left the peppers and onions on the stove a bit longer than the recipe said - I wanted them to be very carmelized and soft. I will definately make this one again.

Excellent. I made this for dinner and we wound up finishing all of it.

Loved this easy and beautiful recipe. Also used a store bought pesto and rubbed the crostini with garlic when it came out of the oven. Just wonderful!

Very good! I double the pesto and use only 4 peppers. To assemble I spread on the pesto first and top with peppers. It serves better this way.

I took this to a mid week elegant cocktail party. It looked lovely and tasted great. I made the pepper onion mixture two days ahead and it kept nicely in the refrigerator. I didn't have time to make the pesto myself so used store bought. Being a garlic lover, I used 2 or 3 garlic cloves instead of 1 teaspoon in the pepper-onion mixture. Also, I toasted the bread, scraped fresh garlic on each piece, then brushed with olive oil, salt and pepper before adding the topping. At the end I added a pine nut garnish on top of the pesto. Would definitely make again.

This was an excellent and easy recipe, albeit a bit time consuming. I added the vinegar more generously (about 2 1/2 Tablespoons) and made it the evening before my dinner gathering. The vinegar taste mellowed out quite a bit overnight and it constrasted nicely with the pesto (I also used pre-made pesto- it's a huge time saver).

Delicious. This is an elegant make-ahead appetizer. Pre-made pesto works fine. This was a big hit at a dinner party (though may have been slightly overshadowed by the shrimp and crab bruschetta I served too - from this site).

I have made this dish several times for gatherings - It has an excellent combination of flavors. The combination of the sweet and sour vinegared peppers with the saltiness and freshness of the basil pesto is quite good. Use the freshest and leafiest basil you can find for your pesto.

Wonderful addition to a cocktail party. So easy, beautiful presentaion and wonderful tasting! Loved the sweetness of the onion and bell peppers with the pizazz of the pesto on top! I also cheated and used jarred pesto for time reasons, but it was amazing!

Wonderful recipe. Note: I did make the mistake of making this without reading the reviews - so I chopped the finished onion pepper mixer in batches with my mezzaluna just to make it a bit smaller for ease in serving - quick and easy fix!. Will definately make again.

This was delish!!! I used the frozen, already chopped peppers from Trader Joe's and it was a zinch to make. Served as appetizer to guests and I only got to have one. The rest were gone in no time!

The flavors of the peppers paired with the pesto was incredible! I did make my own pesto and opted for parmesan reggiano, which I feel boosted the flavor of the pesto. The colors were magnificent, and the presentation perfect! My guests enjoyed each bite. I will definately make this one again.

Nice appetizer, colorful, fairly easy and great to make ahead. I used a large diameter baguette and I think it was easy to eat, but not bite size - needed two bites and could get messy. So I think it's a good idea to try and make bite size portions. Great flavor. Seems pretty healthy and light. Took a long time to cook veggies in pot and will probably sautee next time and maybe add more flavor that way. Bought ready made pesto which was fine. Doubled garlic and was barely noticeable in my opinion. Definitely a keeper and easy. Didn't seem to take that long to spoon stuff on so didn't use any clever techniques as others did.

This was wonderful and easy - I purchased the pesto. Very pretty and elegant - flavor beyond compare!

Great appetizer! I've already served it twice and got RAVE reviews. I chopped the onions and peppers into 1/2" dice as suggested. I make large batches of pesto from my garden and freeze portions, so I had that on hand. To make assembly easier, I used latex gloves (foodservice gloves) to put the pepper mix on the toasts. Then I put the pesto in a baggie, snipped off the corner and squeezed it on top. I had some pepper mix left over, so the next night for dinner I spooned it on top of grilled chicken breasts and topped with a slice of smoked gouda. Broiled to melt the cheese - it was really good.

I made this recipe based on the reviews and brought it to an Italian themed dinner party. Every one of the ten guests RAVED about this appetizer. I didn't even get to try it - they were eaten so fast. This, apparently, is a definite keeper.

Soooo good! I used red onions - and the flavor was just perfect. My guests devoured these and asked for more! I added a little extra garlic too!

I made these as an appetizer for an in-home wedding. Not only were they very good, they were very pretty. I finely chopped the peppers and onions to make them easier to handle. I also used store bought pesto to save time. The only thing I MIGHT do differently next time would be to half each crostini. The bread is crunchy when taken from the oven, and can be a bit messy, especially with veggies and pesto on top. i would just half each, in order to make them bite-size. This was a beautiful and easy appetizer, even for a wedding.

This was an incredibly tasty treat which I used as an appetizer. After preparing it once according to the directions, I prepared it a second time deleting the parmesan in the pesto and not brushing the toasts with oil to save on fat. It was just as good with less fat and beautiful as well!

this was pretty & well received. Next time I would chop pepper and onion mix to make it easier to handle. We used ready made pesto and it worked fine.
