This recipe is excellent! I chopped the veggies and sundried tomatoes really small for my kids and used two smaller loaf pans as that was all I had (and adjusted the cooking time accordingly). Everyone went back for seconds and hubby requested that I "add it to the rotation." A definite keeper!

I was looking for something to use up the big jar of Costco sun dried tomatoes. Wow, this recipe was fantastic. Now frequently asked for by the kids. So tasty it's hard not to take seconds and thirds.

An easy crowd pleaser. A food processor makes easy work of this. First the onions and celery. Next the breadcrumbs and finally, the sun-dried tomatoes. This recipe needed a kick....I added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper. Whew, it was good, but too spicy. Next time will add 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper.

Hubby loved it! I liked it. The recipe is easy and flavorful, and I wonder if my "meh" is due to it being ground turkey vs. beef. I've also prepared for friends who swooned over it!

This produces a flavourful moist meatloat, but it was too salty. I am guessing that the sun dried tomatoes added a bit of salt into the mix. I will cut back on the salt the next time I make it.

Awesome meatloaf!!! BUT lower the salt. I did 1.75 tsp and it was still way too salty. Next time I'm doing 1 tsp. I still enjoyed it and ate it with a bunch of steamed vegetables and some rustic bread. By the way, I made it with kind of fatty (85/15) turkey meat and it was sooooo moist. A new family recipe. So easy to make too!

I have always liked meatloaf, but all the variations I have made up to now were good tasting but really prosaic. However, now I know there's meatloaf, and there's meatloaf! This recipe is off the charts in terms of taste and texture: incredibly delicious and un-prosaic, moist but firm enough to slice nicely. It tops the flavor chart for me. Now that's meatloaf!

Very good recipe, the sundried tomatoes added a nice touch. I used panko bread crumbs, non-fat milk, and dried sundried tomoatoes that a reconstituted in boiling water. I added the broth from the tomatoes to keep it moist which it definitely was. It is a keeper

Rating: 4
When I think "turkey meatloaf," I think dry, bland, yuck. But this recipe is outstanding. The sundried tomatoes and herbs move this meal out of the "healthy but boring" category, into the realm of downright delicious. I don't use quite as much salt as the recipe calls for, but otherwise stick to the recommended ingredients. It is always a hit at the dinner table -- and as meatloaf sandwiches for the rest of the week.

A new favorite turkey meatloaf recipe. We made the meatloaf as written except for halving the salt. We found the meatloaf to be very flavorful and moist with a nicly browned crust. One more variation, we added some Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar to the ketchup before glazing.

For "A Cook from Milwaukee" - are you nuts?!? The reviews are the most helpful part of these recipes! I get more helpful tips from these reviews - what has worked for others, what changes they've made, how to improve the dish - than I sometimes get from the recipe. In fact, I found my favorite recipe for avgolemono on this site - not in the recipes, but in the review for the really poor recipe they list here. The reviews are an enormous help.

Rating: 4
I rarely write a review if I make any changes to a recipe here - drives me nuts when all the wanna be chefs do that. However, I did a couple very small adjustments and everyone who ate it raved about it so I wanted to share. One stalk of celery, chopped medium onion not a large, added 3/4 cup of chopped portabella mushrooms and two chopped carrots. Used kosher salt instead of regular and worcestershire sauce with the ketchup - both of these suggestions were in these reviews. It was the one of the best things I have made off epicurious.

Rating: 3
We followed this recipe exactly (other than cutting down on the salt a bit), and we were very pleased with the results. The meatloaf came out very moist and flavorful. It didn't taste TOO strongly of sun-dried tomatoes, but I thought they were a really nice, unusual addition to an otherwise pretty classic meatloaf recipe. I'd definitely make this one again.

Good Recipe! I never thought about using sun-dried tomatoes with meatloaf or hamburgers before. I made mini-meatloaves so they would cook faster and I made them on the grill. I did find they were a little dry...next time I might use a little of the sun-dried tomato oil to mix in...

Followed exactly, turned out great. Moist, delicious, made great leftovers for the next few days. Going to make again tonight. I only give it 3 forks cause although it's great, it's still just meatloaf, and really I gotta save those 4-fork ratings for the rare sublime dishes.

Very disappointed in this entree. Very bland even after upping the herbs. No more ground turkey for us!

I was looking for low fat and healthy so I cooked up a bunch of mushrooms that I added (saw the idea on one of the other reviews). I have made it once with commercial sun dried tomatoes and once with my own oven dried fresh tomatoes. Both great. My family thought it needed some sort of sauce so the second time I made a mushroom gravy with cream, some dijon mustard, and a squirt of ketchup. We think this meatloaf is better tasting than regular meatloaf, but just a tad dry (hence the gravy).

Turned out great! I added carrots and mushrooms, and used toasted wheat bread for the breadcrumbs. I also agree with previous post- the worcestershire sauce in ketchup was a nice addition. I will definitely make it again!

Pretty good for turkey meatloaf. Would make again except next time will see how many other vegetables i can sautee and add. (turnips?) I added sauteed mushrooms and carrots, used fresh sage, and took a reviewer's recommendation for worcestershire sauce in the ketchup. Cooked the glaze onto the loaf for the full hour by accident but turned out great! I used cheapo breadcrumbs, too :)

Liked it. Next time will cut back on the oregano and sage, but liked the salt. Used kosher, maybe that's why. Didn't have celery, so chopped 2 carrots, and added a few sliced mushrooms to the veg. saute. Used bread crumbs from a week old baguette, and let the milk soak into that for 10 min. Was not too "wet".

I have been making this recipe regularly since it first appeared in 1996 and my husband and I both love it. We agree with those who say that the spicing is pretty aggressive and I reduce everything except the oregano by one half. Tried a new variation tonight that we really enjoyed. I only had a pound of ground turkey in the house so, instead of reducing the recipe, I added chopped portabella mushrooms and sautéed them with the onion and celery for the last 5-6 minutes of cooking time. This may be the best variation yet!!

I was skeptical about the concept of turkey meat loaf, but this was fabulous. Nice and moist, and great flavor. Next time I'll definitely cut the salt. I was out of catsup and so topped it with spaghetti sauce...turned out just fine.

I would strongly urge you to cut the salt and pepper by half. It was way too salty and spicy for me. With the ketchup, it's not too bad, but alone it was way too salty. Other than that it was pretty good. Reminded me of thanksgiving. I would make it again with the changes in salt and pepper.

A delicious recipe, this meatloaf satisfies like old-fashioned comfort food, yet offers a subtle updated lightness. The sun-dried tomatoes add some body and flavor to the loaf, and the milk keeps it moist. (I usually sop meatloaf in ketchup and didn't feel the need with this recipe). I made 3 alterations to the recipe: I added 1/3 lb of ground buffalo meat, used my own oil free dehydrated tomatoes, and reduced the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. I also followed the suggestion of a reviewer on the recipe-swap blog, and baked the meatloaf in a muffin pan so that I could freeze the leftovers in easy portions. A huge hit--this may become a standard.

Rating: 4
I'm not able to have milk or wheat products so I did some tweaking, but this recipe was wonderful! I used my mini-chopper to mince the celery, onion, a large carrot, a medium zucchini & a couple of large garlic. I used fresh sage & the oregano but no eggs, milk, s/p or breadcrumbs. Topped it with a zippy homemade BBQ sauce & baked it in my mini-loaf pan. They were moist & extremely flavorful. Definitely a do- over!

Rating: 4
great recipe! just a few notes on the modifications I made -- as many reviewers noted, I reduced the salt to 1 tsp (and after tasting, would probably have reduced it further, to 2/3 tsp). I threw Trader Joes rosemary ciabatta in the food processor for the breadcrumbs, and used fresh sage because I had some on hand. I also added in about a cup of chopped carrots to the vegetable saute for some extra nutrition. I baked it as a free-form loaf on parchment paper and it was done in 1 hour and 15 min. For the glaze, I mixed Worcestshire sauce with the ketchup for a little extra tang.

Horrible. Horrible Horrible horrible. I listened to other reviewers and reduced the spices. It was then bland. I listened to others about how it was too wet, so I cooked it on a sheet pan, to dry it. I was left with a bland, dry, tasteless mess that I wouldn't eat myself, let alone serve to others. If you do make this, follow the recipe (unlike what I did), and it may be palatable. As for me, there are other, better recipes out there. This is going in the garbage- dinner, recipe and all.

Rating: 4
Perhaps too much salt...also would recommend instead of ketchup at the end, take a can of campbell's tomato/rice soup and cover it in the beginning over the loaf and bake. My kids said this was the best meatloaf I ever made, and one of them is a quasi- vegetarian. Make sure tomatoes are cut up fine to get the taste without the lumps. Highly recommended and will make again!

I have been trying many different meat loaf recipes looking for one that was moist, flavorful and easy to make. This is it!! The sun dried tomatoes are perfect and per other reviewers advice, I cut the herbs in half. In the end I thought that it could have used more than half, but probably not the full amount for only 1.5 lbs of ground turkey. I also used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs to make it easier and it worked beautifully. Will definitely be making this again, my husband and I both loved it.

Rating: 2
I used 2 1/2 lbs of turkey but I left the spice measurement as is b/c others said it was too strong for the original version using only 1 1/2 lbs. That worked well. I used some of the 'extra' ingredient suggesions such as carrot & garlic. I added some of my own--a diced portobello cap and hot paprika. Reviews said to go easy on the milk. I did at first, poured it directly into fresh breadcrumbs as I like to do. It had a nice thick consistency of oatmeal. But then I added a bit more milk b/c I had more meat. Mistake. I then had to add more breadcrumbs to dry it up. All in all, a very tasty meatloaf, but not our favorite. I will make this again w/less milk and maybe combine beef w/it next time.

I made meatloaf muffins out of these and honestly looked forward to eating one every night. I used store-bought bread crumbs, so it tasted a bit too much like filler, but I'm making them again tomorrow and I'll use homemade bread crumbs (ooo, or oatmeal like someone else recommended). Otherwise, tasty as mess.

Great recipe! The turkey is nice and moist, with great flavor. The herbs might be too much; I would probably cut them back next time. I altered the recipe slightly while making it. I added an extra handful of breadcrumbs because I felt the mixture was too wet. Additionally, I baked it on a sheet pan with parchment paper in a log form (if that makes sense). Still came out fantastic.

I'VE FOUND THE PERFECT TURKEY MEATLOAF. I made this tonight for the week for my husband's and I lunch for work because I saw the high rating and I felt a bit skeptical..My last few turkey loaves have always been dry. I didnt make the fresh bread crumbs but I used the plain Progresso one and it came out delicious. I had 3 small slices just to test it out and boy was I amazed..This weekend is our xmas party potlock and I'm taking this meatloaf to work. Of course, a fresh one. Dont skimp on the sundried tomatoes, they do make a big difference and especially the celery and onions, it tastes like ground turkey stuffing loaf. Bon Appetit!!

I was really looking to making my husband a meatloaf lover after reading all the great reviews, but although I thought it lived up to its reputation, my husband, who is not a big meatloaf person, thought it was just okay. But, I loved it! I did go with 1 1/2 tsp of the seasonings as previous reviewers suggested, as well as only 1/4 C milk. I did a topping of red pasta sauce and I thought it went better with it than ketchup. The sun- dried tomatoes really make this taste great!

This is a great turkey loaf recipe. For my taste it was a little too wet, so I used no milk. If you were to make it with leftover roast turkey the milk would be the right idea, but ground turkey containe s a lot of water. I added 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes and some carrots. I used this for a large group; everybody loved it. Served it the next day in thin slices on hot buttered toast, yum.

My guests just left and I had to write my review for this recipe - it is absolutely the BEST meatloaf any of us have ever had. Real comfort food. Instead of just catsup on top I combined 1/2 C brown sugar, 1/4 C catsup, 1/2 tsp dry mustard. Spread over top, then bake. Oh my, so good!! I had to make copies of the recipe for three friends.

This is SO good. I doubled the recipe (3.75 pounds ground turkey total, because that's how it was packaged), cooked two loaves freeform on a greased foil-lined baking sheet, left the house for an errand that was supposed to take half an hour, got stuck in traffic, came home certain they would be ruined . . . and even though they tested at 190 degrees (and were admittedly slightly dry) they were still absolutely delicious. Nine people, including kids, devoured both. I used butter instead of oil to saute the vegetables, because I wanted buttery drippings for gravy (so also omitted the ketchup topping). This is every bit as good as the usual ground chuck/pork/veal mix and better for us. Do try it!

3-1/2 forks - yum but not-I'm-impressing-your-snotty-friends-yum I'm making this yet again as I write. I add a few cloves of garlic as well as replacing 2 celery stalks with 2 small shredded zucchini. I also add about a 1/3 cup of chopped parsley. I use the spices as listed and it works for us - perhaps because of the extra zucchini. Also kosher instead of table salt is a deal breaker - kosher will not be as salty. An affordable, healthy and tasty meal(s) for us.

This was indeed very moist, but too moist for us. It was somewhat mushy and oily, and I even cooked it past the recommended time. I would cut the olive oil out and use regular sun-dried tomatoes vs. the oil-packed ones.

Holy moly, it's tasty comfort food and it's so healthy! My baby's even snarfing it down. Instead of 3 celery stalks, I used 1 celery stalk, 1 carrot and 1 zucchini. Only 1 tsp of salt, pepper and herbs as suggested by many others. The other difference is that I shaped it into a loaf shaped mound on a cookie sheet instead of using a load pan. It only needed about 35 minutes and then I added the ketchup for an additional 5 minutes only because we were impatient to eat. I think the free-form loaf gets more crust all around and it definitely saves some cooking time. Will definitely make it again.

I made this just today. I am also used to turkey loaf being bland and dry. I have just started eating meat again after 15 years of vegetarianism so I was a little grossed out with the raw meat but it was worth it!! Fabulous recipe. Moist, very flavorful and my fickle husband loved it. I didn't have all the ingredients so I used Trader Joe's Sundried Tomato Pesto, seasoned bread crumbs, halved the salt omitted the herbs, celery and carrot. Still came out great. I'll make it again for sure. Also, I cooked it in glass and it took 10 minutes less.

Very tasty. I process slightly stale Italian or French bread in my processor, then add the tomatoes, so the bread absorbs the tomato taste. I also skip the step about sauteeing the onion.

I was skeptical at first--especially with the tomatoes--but with so many positive reviews, I had to try it.. Very tasty and moist. The tomatoes don't overpower the taste like I thought they might.

Very tasty, we like spicy food and enjoyed it with one exception - it was brutally salty (we had to mix it up with unsalted mashed potatoes to eat). Thought two teaspoons was a bit much, but as no one else noted this in reviews, maybe it was the brand of sun-dried tomatoes I had on hand. Next time, I won't use any salt.

Delicious! Leftovers make a great (cold) sandwich. I only used 1 lb of ground turkey and I used fresh sage; I thought the seasonings were just right - but the fresh sage was probably not as strong as dried. I did use oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes but drained them thoroughly. I liked the ketsup on top, but marinara sauce, as suggested by another reviewer, would be good also. And finally, I used seasoned Progresso bread crumbs and 100% white meat ground turkey (low fat) and it was just fine.

yum, yum, even though I forgot to halve the amount of spices as suggested by other reviewers, which would definitely be a good idea as they are a little overwhelming, this was still a great meatloaf with a good consistency.

A real winner. The best meat loaf I've had. I too reduced the sage and oregano to 1 1/2 tsp. As much as I love pepper, I thought the amount overpowered the other flavors, and I would reduce it to 1 1/2 tsp. I pureed the tomatoes and was glad I did. I also recommend finely chopping the celery or the meat loaf may be too "chunky". I too used plain dry bread crumbs, which worked fine. The addition of brown sugar to the ketchup was tasty. This recipe is a keeper, my first 4-fork rating!

Very easy and very tasty. The sun-dried tomatoes are great and really make this dish what it is. I might experiment with additional spices, but I was very pleased with the results.

This was delicious! My husband praised it all during dinner and insisted on having the leftovers for lunch the next day. The spicing might be a little sharp for sensitive palates (other reviewer suggested reducing to 1.5 teaspoons - I might try it)but great taste combo. I think I will try the chopped apple suggestion some time, too.

I made this for a couple friends, one of which had never eaten meatloaf before. She was amazed by it and the other friend said that she should never try any other meatloaf again because she would only be disappointed. This is SO good! I plan on making it many more times in the future.

This dish was great. I substituted a small part of turkey with 1 cup of grated zucchini b/c I used 99% fat free turkey and I was afraid the loaf would come out a little dry. It worked great and I got some vitamins out of the process. I used whole wheat bread crumbs (as suggested) for some fiber. My boyfriend thought it was going to be bland. And he has requested that we make this a regular item on our "menu"!

I've been able to impress my cooking husband with this dish! On occasion, have used whole wheat bread in place of white for the crumbs, and have also sauteed part of an apple with the celery & onion. It always tastes great!

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe! I've made this MANY times since it came out in BonAppetit in 1996. Another great way to use ground turkey.

What a great way to use ground turkey! The meatloaf came out moist and delicious! This recipe will definitely replace my old meatloaf recipe. I used canned tomato sauce instead of ketchup and it turned out fine.

As far as meatloaf goes, this is delicious! It is very moist and tasty, especially for turkey. I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs instead of fresh, and it worked out well, much easier than the do-it-yourself kind. This is a great family meal that all will enjoy!

I am always looking for ways to use lowfat ground turkey, which can be so dry and bland. This recipe is a keeper. The meatloaf is moist and flavorful - the sun dried tomatoes really make the dish.

Pretty good - the sun dried tomatoes add a certain zap. However, something seems to be missing... maybe a real tomato glaze/sauce on top, rather than ketchup, would be a better taste compliment. There is a recipe on this site for another turkey meatloaf (Bon Apétit September 1998) that is next to heaven. That is truly the greatest meatloaf ever. This one is not near that! Please try it... enjoy!

I've been making this meatloaf since the recipe first appeared and love it each time....a time saving tip....use pre-maid breadcrumbs. A calorie saving tip.....use dried sun dried tomatoes that have been soaked rather than those packed in oil. I do both of these things and don't miss the original ingredients.

This has been well recieved by everyone who has tried it. I have had people who said they did not care for meatloaf, love this recipe.

I avoided meatloaf for years, but this was great! Easy to make and great for left-overs. I loved the flavour of the sun-dried tomatoes

Delicious! The best review that I can give is that even our 2 year old granddaughter asked for seconds. I took the suggestions from the "Cook from Eugene, OR" and used 1.5 tsp of oregano and sage and we thought the flavor was perfect.

I baked this loaf in a stoneware pan so it stayed very moist. Next time I would experiment with using less oregano and sage (perhaps cut down to 1.5 tsp) to allow sun-dried tomato flavor to come through a bit more. I served with Sweet Potato Fries (recipe in Bon Appetit 2/98) which worked well.
