I work at a residential rehab and sometimes men can be picky eaters but this was totally consumed. Next time I will make more. It was delicious as is although our cook did forget the green onions and we used turnips instead of rutabagas because we had them on hand.

Made this recipe as an alternative to traditional thanksgiving side dishes. It was absolutely wonderful. Many people in my family had never tried things like parsnips, rutabaga or beets, but everyone but the most picky person in the world thought it was delicious! I will be making this dish often in cold weather. Yum!

This was very good - have made it twice. Substituted golden beets for beets and they were excellent.

This recipe was delicious! I made it for a few friends and they just ooo'd and awe'd over it. Even my husband ate most of his serving (and he rarely even takes a serving of vegetables). I definitely recommend it for a great fall side dish!

This was very good. I used 5 cloves of garlic and a variety of root vegetables and it was wonderful!

I have tried this recipe a couple of times with different combinations of vegetables. It always comes out excellent - it is my favorite recipe for roasted vegetables. I just vary the amount of oil and maple syrup to the amount of vegetables - I always add extra beets and use vidalia onions. Yummy with smoked baby back ribs and potato salad.

This is just delicious -- non-veggie eaters loved it too! It is easy, GORGEOUS on a platter, and a bit sweet so it went great with a roasted pork loin.

First of all the amount of vegetables called for was entirely more than could be handled in one oven! I guess my idea of "large" isn't the same as theirs? Second of all I was disappointed in the flavor, which was lacking except for the flavor of the vegetables themselves. This wasn't a bad recipe but wasn't worth the trouble of making.

This is a wonderful and versatile recipe! I've made it twice--the first time exactly as written, and the second (necessitated by a faulty oven), by steaming the vegetables in the syrup/oil mixture on the stove, to great result. I'm going to try it a third time using a combo method (steaming, then finishing in the oven, which is my preferred method for roasting potatoes anyway). From my first two test preps, my learnings are: (1) By all means, do not skip the butter and green onions, which absolutely transport the dish in flavor and eye-appeal; (2) likewise, the beauty of the dish was enhanced by swirling the vegetables in a bowl so that the beets bleed color throughout; (3) I added even more color by selecting rutabagas with gorgeous purple skins and leaving them unpeeled, and including a red onion, cut in eighths. Whichever method and assortment of vegetables you choose, this is an absolutely elegant, mouth-watering dish, guaranteed to please and impress.

I used 1/8 cup garlic oil and 1/8 cup olive oil. May experiment with other flavored oils in the future. We absolutely loved it!

I tried this recipe for New Years Eve. It was a hit and is a great recipe. I disagree w/ the folks that suggest skipping the green onions, they add flavor and color. We will make this recipe again, it's a great winter recipe.

Made these last evening and am looking forward to the left-overs tonight. They are delicious.

This was a great side dish. My husband doesn't like rutabagas or parsnips but thought they tasted great in this recipe. I doubled the amount of oil mixture and left out the green onions at the end. A delicious, colorful dish I will make again.

Beautiful dish. We've made it several times-- fairly quick and very easy. We mix the veggies in a big bowl with the syrup etc, so the beets give a nice red swirl stain to the other veggies. We agree with the others that you should just forget the green onions. Cheers!

This was wonderful, I also left out the green onions and also the rutabaga (not a family favorite!). It was so easy, I'll certainly be doing this one again.

made this recipe for the second straight Thanksgiving feast and it's a winner. use whatever root vegetables you can get and skip the butter and green onions. go for a variety of colors, it looks great and tastes even better.

Great recipe! But, you may want to leave out the green onions since there are enough onions already. Also, I tried replacing the 'large onion', with whole tiny boiler onions. Worked well!
