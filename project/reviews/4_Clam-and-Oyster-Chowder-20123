This is fabulous! However (I hate when I do this), oysters are yucky to me so I used mussels. How wonderful and great this is. I will make it again and again. Thanks

I didn't have oysters so I added a chopped up cooked potato and celery to the onions and garlic. It stretched the recipe and everyone loved it.

Excellent! We served this as the main (and only) course for our Christmas Eve dinner (with champagne and oyster crackers.) While the recipe says it serves 4-6, it only served 2 as the main course. I used 1.5 - 2 T. of onion/garlic/shallot and a little more than 1/4c. chopped parsley. I was also liberal with the cayenne but only used a pinch of sea salt. It was spicy and delicious.
