go with 4lbs yukon. cut in 2" cubes. start in cold heavily salted water just covering level. bring to a boil w 3large (peeled) garlic cloves and simmer for 15-20 min. check for doneness w a fork. drain. put back in original pot to dry out a bit. meanwhile, boil cream. then put potatoes in ricer or press. add cream. then knobs (1tbs at a time) of cold butter. the carried over heat of the potatoes will melt it softly. fold and serve.

Very simple recipe. Great to accompany steak. I did buy a potato ricer. It really made a difference.

By far the best mashed potatoes I can actually repeat the taste & texture of! I didn't use potato rice as I don't own one (nor group up with one and I heart my Dad's mashed potatoes). I think I needed a guideline to follow as I don't usually follow recipes to a T and while I didn't a 100% on this one, pretty close and well received!

Should be called GARLIC mashed potatoes. I will never find garlic mashed potatoes to be "perfect" or even preferable.

I specifically went out and bought a potato ricer for this. Initially it made the potatoes so fluffly-- but i think because I was making so many (I had to triple this recipe) it may have fizzled out on me. In the future i will use the ricer, but I don't think it made a huge difference for me. All in all I'm sure it helped. As every recipe I've made from this site, I'd make it again.

Best mashed potatoes I've ever made. Tons of flavor with much less fat & calories than other recipes. Fluffy, delicious, and to die for!

Excellent. I doubled this for our Thanksgiving and made them about 2 hours ahead of our dinner. I didn't need all of the milk and butter to get the right consistency. I will definitely make these again.

Made these for my kid's Thanksgiving feast at school. Invested $20 in a potato ricer, and I think it was well worth it. These potatoes are very light. I used 4 tablespoons of butter and 1% milk as that is what I had at home, and I think I just needed to go a little heavier on the salt (I don't think the infants and toddlers will miss it!). Can't wait to use the potato ricer for my next child as I made all of my own baby food.

Light, fluffy, delicious with subtle garlic flavor. I added a whole stick of butter and salt to taste.
