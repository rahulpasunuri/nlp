The Tarragon Vinaigrette part of this recipe caught my eye, but when I read the chicken breasts were to be cooked in a microwave I nearly bypassed. I used the suggestion of other reviewers of the vinaigrette as a marinate, using the 1/2 tsp. of dijon mustard, the juice of 1 half small lemon, 1 TBSP minced tarragon, 1/2 c. olive oil, and 1/4 cup of white wine, a pinch of salt and a couple of grindings of black pepper, omitting the scallions. I whisked this together and marinated my four quail in it, not using chicken because my clients dislike it. I only allowed it to marinate about 30 minutes, so it wouldn't be overpowering, then saute them in olive oil until crisp and golden brown. The comments stated, "absolutely delicious". For microwaving...using it to cook with it, I believe makes for a disappointing texture and flavours just don't blend as well. If I ever use a microwave with chicken, its after sauteing it until golden brown, then making sure it is completely cooked through by microwaving. I give this one 3 stars and not a full four because by recipe, I fully believe another cooking method should be used. I will definitely make the vinaigrette as a marinade again.

I'd never cooked chicken in the microwave before and was a bit nervous about it, but with the excellent vinaigrette the dish turned out quite tasty. I served it with steamed asparagus with lemon and pepper. The microwave cooking is a great time saver (on both the cooking and the cleaning up ends), so this recipe will become part of my repertoire. Next time I will take a minute or so off the cooking time to make the chicken more juicy. I will also try marinating the chicken as suggested, though the recipe was very good just as written.

This was ok, my garlic turned teal green for some reason; but not one I'd bother with again.

Split chicken breasts in half, and marinade in broth/mustard/lemon/herbs + garlic for 30 minutes. Bake at 325-350 for 20+ minutes. Serve with couscous and fresh parsley. Perfect for family or guests.

I too, fried the chicken with the broth and a little oil, made a nice brown crust on the chicken. Next time, will double the vinagrette and marinate the chicken a bit. Very fast and easy - took me 20 minutes!

This was a very nice light dinner. I added 1 tbsp or so of butter and I might try and add a little dry white wine to the sauce to make it a bit more interesting.

I also suggest cooking the chicken in the oven. As side dishes I steamed green and yellow squash and had red potatoes too. I saved a little of the sauce and put over the sides. Also had an olive oil based bread dipping saucea for the bread. It tasted great, was easy to make and made an attractive presentation!

Always on the look out for a great recipe for 2? This is an excellent choice. Followed another viewers advice and marinated the chicken for an hour in a batch of the marinade, minus the broth. Pan cooked the chicken as microwave chicken doesn't appeal to me. Made another batch of the vinaigrette and served over baby greens. Absolutely lovely.

Fabulous! Added Garlic 4 cloves and did make extra vinaigrette,was very worth it mmmmmmm. However,I did marinate for 1 hour and grilled the meat. Sorry, I think microwaves are only for defrosting

Not only was this terrific warm, but the next day it was even better cold, for lunch. I would give this five forks!

I made the same changes as KC Smith--excellent suggestions. I would definitely make this dish again and serve it to company.

Tonight I needed a dish that was quick, easy, and I hoped delicious, and this fit the bill. To make things even easier I used two chicken breast halves from one of those pouches of frozen chicken breasts our local grocery store carries that I had in my freezer. As for the recipe itself, I didn't change a thing except to limit the microwaving time to 7 minutes total on high, with a 5-minute standing time. Also, I served the chicken warm rather than at room temperature. A nice recipe.

i changed the dish a bit. i am not a fan of microwave cooking so i tripled all the ingredients and made it into a marinade. i marinaded the chicken for about 30 minutes and then put everything including the liquid into a frying pan and poached the chicken. i used a bit more lemon juice to give it some more tang and added a lot of garlic. i used teh sauce over rice as an accompliament.

Incredible! It only took me about 25 min, it was very easy & very tasty! The only problem was not enough vinaigrette.. next time I will double that part. I will definately tell my freinds this one.
