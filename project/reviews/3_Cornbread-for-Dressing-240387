I was glad to find a gluten-free recipe for cornbread - but I suggest that it be used for DRESSING, as the name implies. When I just took a small bite of the plain cornbread, it swelled up in my throat, choking me. Scary. If you eat it plain, be very careful, and have water nearby. I still plan to cut it into small cubes, and add a lot of moist ingredients to make a wonderful gluten-free dressing.

I followed this recipe exactly and found the consistency was good but tasted bland overall. I'd up the salt and sugar a bit. Also, I agree with the previous commenter about the eggs, it's a bit to egg-y so I'd cut back the eggs by one or two. Once it baked and cooled we cut it into cubes and re- toasted it so it would remain firm in the stuffing.

If you recommend this cornbread for stuffing, it would be helpful to include how many cups of cornbread crumbs this makes so that I would know how many recipes to make for my cornbread stuffing recipe.

This was a perfect cornbread for stuffing. It cut into cubes easily and didn't crumble.

We thought this was terrific as a cornbread - we didn't use it as an ingredient for stuffing. I used medium grind, whole corn cornmeal which made the texture wonderful. Loved the fact that it didn't have flour and had very little sugar. I used only one and a half tablespoons of sweetner - half of which was sugar, the other half Splenda.

I am happy to find this recipe without wheat flour. I am a celiac and have not had stuffing since my diagnosis. Great texture for the stuffing. I will make this again and again.

5 eggs? This turned out like quiche with a hint of cornbread aroma.
