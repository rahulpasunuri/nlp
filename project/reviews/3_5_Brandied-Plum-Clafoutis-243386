I've made this recipe many times using different fruits & liquors. This time I used prune plums & substituted amaretto for brandy like someone suggested earlier (cut the 7 Tbsp sugar to 3.5 Tbsp if using amaretto). I also used 2 Tbsp flour + 1 Tbsp ground almond meal, which gave it a more substantial texture than the original custard, & baked for 30 mins. Served with whipped cream. This was sooo good!

Overall I think this recipe is less than the sum of its parts. That isn't to say that it isn't tasty--it certainly is--but it leaves something to be desired in my opinion. The brandy overwhelms the fruit flavor, and if you are using nice ripe fruit I think the recipe serves to mask that flavor rather than bring it out. This would be a good autumnal recipe to use on sad, late-season fruit you find at the grocery store. If you've got good organic fruit to use, I'd look for a better, simpler clafouti/flognarde recipe.

Simple and delicious. I made this in a deep dish ceramic pie plate and let it cook about 10 minutes longer. I skipped the sugar on top and it came out plenty sweet. Beautiful dessert!

This is my standard go-to dessert recipe. For a variation, I substituted fresh peaches & apricots for the plums, and amaretto for the brandy. It was equally delicious!

Great and tasty. It's a winner in my book. Plum are so good for you too! If you want to learn more about the health benefits of plums read http://www.newrinkles.com/index.php/archive/did-you-know-plums/

A winner! Although it could probably use a little more brandy..

These were good, but I think flavor and acidity from the orange juice was too strong. I would use less if I make them again.

I made this twice in a week. The first time I used prune plums. The second time I used black plums. The prune plums were more tart and yielded more juice than the black plums. Both clafoutis were good but I would use prune plums again. Substitutions: 1) I used plum schnaps instead of brandy; 2) I used whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream; 3) I squeezed 1/2 fresh orange instead of using frozen concentrate. Both times the recipe was fantastic and received rave reviews from family & book club members.

Last night I made 1/2 of this recipe and put it into a 6" diameter aluminum baking dish. It did not get done in the allotted time, and it never did "puff" up or "set" in the middle. My plums produced a lot of juice when I cooked them, and I had 3/8 cup of liquid after adding the brandy and OJ to the juices. But I still felt that I had to add some heavy cream. So I added enough cream to make 1/2 cup of liquid in my measuring cup--perhaps I should have added extra flour?? Perhaps some leavening agent was deleted from the recipe?? I had to bake it about twice as long (sometimes covered) as what the recipe dictates. The texture needs some work; it was all stuck on and almost burned by the time it was done. No one wanted any dessert by this time. Today I put the original container into a warm water bath in the oven for about 15 minutes, and then I was able to scrape it off the bottom of the aluminum container and divide it into individual microwaveable dishes. After nuking these and topping them with ice cream, they were DELICIOUS, but they sure looked yucky. This is why I have downgraded the recipe to two forks. And, I would not make this recipe again

I didn't have appropriate individual cups so I put it into one 10" quiche/tart dish. Also, when measuring the liquid, I already had 1Cup before adding any cream. I added 1/4-1/2C. cream anyway, then increased the flour by about 1Tbl. Total cooking time was about 45 minutes, then I stuck it under the broiler for a bit just to completely brown the top. The texture and taste are really good - the touch of orange and brandy with the plums is very nice. Definitely keeping this to use with our plum tree harvest!

My family loves plums. I adjusted the recipe for my diabetic son, using Splenda for the sugar and yogurt instead of the whipped cream. Delicious!

This was so good! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but put it all into one big glass dish (instead of individual ramekins) and skipped the last step of sprinkling sugar on top. There is plenty of sugar as is. It turned out really well--this just may be my favorite clafoutis recipe of all time!
