Excellent. Used a bit more rosemary and about 1/2 c of mozzarella on pizza dough from Trader Joes.

Delicious! Replaced rosemary with basil. Carmelized the onions. Otherwise, pretty much followed the recipe.

I don't recommend this recipe- there were too many different flavors and it just didn't work.

Really quite good! It's different, that's for sure, but I enjoyed it.

I used my own pizza-dough but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter. A friend and I found it absolutely delicious, while my husband found it merely "okay". -- The bean paste made for a different, softer texture than a standard tomato sauce pizza, but it was pleasing nonetheless. The arugula was a must -- crunchy and deeply flavorful, bringing a top note to the complex array of flavors including the creamy cheese, acidic tomatoes, sweet onions and the earthy rosemary). As far as I'm concerned, this recipe is love from first to last bite.

OK, I confess, I completely changed this recipe and that's what I based my rating on. I don't like rosemary, so I used fresh oregano instead. I used feta instead of goat cheese, because that's what I had on hand. Finally, I used fresh basil instead of greens - again because that's what I had in the garden. I've made this with both canned and dried beans and it's good both ways.

This went straight into the dog bowl. I've made a lot of pizzas and had high hopes considering the ingredients, but thought this recipe was terrible and a waste of time. If your canine is hungry, try it - my dog would give it 4 forks!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written. My family hated it, and they like almost everything. It was terrible. We tossed it in the garbage.

Good and flavorful, but the garlic is surprisingly powerful. I'd use less or maybe just rub a crushed clove against the rolled out crust. Also, if you brush the outside of the crust with olive oil, it turns a beautiful toasty brown when you bake. Otherwise, quite tasty and attractive.

I substitute peppers for the arrugula and canned stewed tomatoes for the plum tomatoes. It is a great low fat pizza.

This was really great and extremely satisfying. I am a big bean fan, and before I saw this recipe I hadn't thought of putting bean puree on pizza, but it's sooo good. One clove of garlic goes a long way, and 1 t. dried rosemary does a good job, too. I didn't add any of the oil to anything (who needs it? can you really taste that 1 t. oil?) and didn't miss it. I used 6 or 7 canned whole tomatoes and wish I'd used a few more, and only about 2 oz. goat cheese, though I wish I'd used more, perhaps 3 oz. (I think I was confused by the white of the bean puree against the brown of the whole wheat crust I made, so I thought there was more cheese than there was.) With these modifications, this earns a definite 4 forks, but as it stands, this wins an easy 4 forks for inventiveness. I think I will use bean purees on my pizzas from now on. p.s. If you like this recipe, check out Pinto Bean and Feta Cheese Quesadillas, also on this site. It's a similar idea, applied to quesadillas.

This was very good. I couldn't find arugula so I used spinach instead and it worked very well. I also cheated and used a pre-made pizza shell, which cut down the prep time. The combination of colors makes also adds to this dish. It was just as delicious the following day for lunch.

My husband and I liked this pizza - but we thought it was "heavy". I would use less beans next time. We did like the rosemary flavor.
