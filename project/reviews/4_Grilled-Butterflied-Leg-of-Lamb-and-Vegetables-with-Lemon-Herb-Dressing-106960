This is a summer staple at our house! I add lemon juice to the marinade and lemon zest and capers to the dressing. We like the veggies topped with crumbled feta cheese. I recommend trimming as much fat as possible from the lamb to keep it as mild as possible.

Served this on Easter and it was a success. The veggies are the shining element in this recipe!! The flavor was awesome, especially with the feta. Our cooking time for the lamb was about 45 minutes, where other people said the grill only took 15-20, and ours was not overdone in any way. My only complaint is that we took the advise of the shorter grilling time, so everything else sat, waiting for the lamb to get done, and wasn't quite as perfect as if it was all finished at the same time. I'd follow the recipe with timing and you should be fine.

It may be redundant to say how terrific this recipe is but I made it yesterday to rave reviews, even from the children.Easy, convenient since it can all be prepared ahead of time,delicious.

This was really nice. Marinated onions on their own, but the rest of the veggies were done together. The onion marinade baste added a nice flavour to the lamb. An excellent low carb meal. Will make again.

This is a relatively easy party dish that is as beautiful as it is delicious. Even those who are not big lamb fans love it!

This recipe is always a huge hit. After I salt & pepper the veggies, I place them in plastic gallon bags with the lemon herb dressing and really let them marinate. I then dump them out onto the grill. On a gas grill, you don't need 15 mins for the onions, and keep a close eye on the lamb, it is ready very quickly. You don't want to over cook the lamb. Be sure and remove as much of the fat as you can. This is a "go to" recipe for me and everyone thinks I am a genius after they have it. The presentation is great and the veggies are even better the next day. Buen 'provecho!

Wonderful recipe. However, having grilled this twice we've never found it takes more than 15 minutes (maybe 20) to cook the lamb. We do trim the butterfly to get rid of excess fat so the pieces aren't totally even, but it is quick cooking. Also, having done the onions twice, and using the lemon marinade the second time, I wouldn't use wine. Too wasteful. The veggies are great.

outstanding. I made the recipe without any modifications. I followed the instructions to the T, and was really pleasantly surprised when the veggies fit perfectly on the grill, and we only lost a few slice of the squash. Next time I would not use as much wine. when we grilled the lamb, it didn't need all that much basting. As for leftovers (we did have some)...absolutely delicious in a quiche !! I served it with the herbed couscous

This recipe is a keeper. Everyone loved Easter Sunday dinner. Didn't use the feta ...

Halved the marinade and used lamb chops instead of the leg as it was just the 3 of us. The marinade is outstanding and I will use it again. Made the veggies as well (halving everything). This dish makes for a beautiful platter presentation.

This was really delicious and my husband loved it! I didn't have fresh thyme, but it was still terrific. I marinated it for the whole day, and didn't make the vegetables marinade. I just threw some sliced zucchini and baby eggplant in with the marinade and grilled them with the lamb - delicous! Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe twice. Both times got rave reviews. The Lamb marinade is to die for. And the dressing for the veggies is great too. Marinade the lamb overnight for more flavor and the viggies for at least 4 hours. I used green and red peppers, mushrooms and small white onions. Excellent dish. Will make it over and over again.

We thought this was outstanding. We broiled the squash and zucchini in the oven and did the onions and peppers on the grill. Cook the lamb by temperature as a gas grill will take less than 18 minutes.

This lamb & veggie dish was great. We stayed at friends house and they made it for us. We have been craving it ever since. I am now making it for our friends back at home.

Outstanding! I did make a few little changes though. I did not bother separating the veggies and used asparagus instead of the yellow squash. I also added some wine to the meat marinade. Everyone raved!

I was a little surprised when the lamb didn't marinate in the wine - and I'm not sure I'd waste wine on the red onions again - but it was a delicious recipe. Very easy, too.

!WOW!....even while marinatin the lamb for only 5 hours the meat had the juicy kick that you look for in a good lamb. I would recomend this to anyone!

WOW! I only made the lamb (not enough time for the vegies) and while it only marinated for 5 hours, everyone loved, loved, loved it. The flavors were subtle and delicious. The grill was terrific and butterflying it made it such a breeze. This was very easy to prepare and will be a repeat in our house for sure!

Absolutly delicious and v. easy. Great recipe for casual entertaining b/c prep can be done ahead of time. Looks great on the platter, too! I added new potatoes to the mix. Leftovers were great for gyros and grilled veg and lamb pizza w/ mozzarella and feta cheese.

This was an excellent use of a leg of lamb. The next day, it made for fantastic gyros meat. The rosemary really brings out the flavor well.

I made this for friends and it was fantastic. Plus it can be prepared ahead and grilled last minute. The vegetables were sooo good and the marinade really permeated the lamb for wonderful flavor.
