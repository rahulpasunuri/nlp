I with you Mr. Rowlett -- more tedious than it is worth - thogh they are tasty. Don't worry about a Patronizing Cook from Berkeley -- those folks always assume we Texans need a good learnin' from the likes of them and their Euro lovin' ways!

These were quite and I would probably make again. To the previous reviewer: Biscuit is synonymous with cookie in many places, most notably the UK.

Well Ian, i just made these "biscuits" and i have to tell you honestly it was just more tedious to make these than i care to do again. They are good with coffee,and the Gin Syrup was good (may try it on some bread pudding) and the kids really liked them(without the Gin sauce)but all in all it was just an OK recipe. Down South here we call these cookies, and a biscuit is served hot with butter and jam or with a good covering of sausage gravy. This is just an opinion of an ol country cook.
