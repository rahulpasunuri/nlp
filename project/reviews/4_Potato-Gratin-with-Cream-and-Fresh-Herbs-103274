This is an excellent recipe. I used Yukon Gold potatoes, which gives the gratin a beautiful golden color. I also added more salt than called for, but other than that I followed the recipe. I highly recommend it.

Great recipe. i've made it four times and it's always a success. i've substituted minced onion for some of the chives which i think is an improvement. Fresh herbs are a must.

I've made this twice and really loved it both times. i substituted chopped onion for the chives which from reading some of the other reviews might improve flavor. Fresh thyme is a must.

This recipe rocks, even when halved. I've never felt the need to add additional salt to it. Only hint is don't pre-slice your potatoes and soak them in water to prevent discolouration. They absorb too much of the water and when you go to make the recipe do not, therefore, absorb as much as the cream mixture as necessary.

This is my "go to" potatoe recipe. I make it every time and there is none left....ever! I do put in more salt than is called for. I really like that there is no cheese in this.

Very good and very simple. Put extra salt, I ended up using about a tablespoon!

This was my first attempt at any type of Potato Gratin. Made it yesterday for Christmas dinner with our Roast Prime Rib with Madeira Sauce and Horseradish sauce (also from this site). They were super easy and really creamy and delicious. I added some freshly grated parmesan between the layers and used some extra salt. Love this!

Didn't have any fresh chive, so used green onion and omitted thyme - delicious results! My husband had the leftovers for breakfast the next morning!

I was disappointed with this recipe after all the good reviews. Added onion & garlic too but found it lacking. Don't recommend this one.

This is a very simple recipe that always has delicious results. I've made it a dozen times - all to rave reviews!

These potatoes were incredibly delicious. I prepared the recipe as is but doubled the salt. Putting in 2 tsp was just right. Chopped or sliced garlic would also be a nice addition. Everybody came back for seconds on this dish. There were 4 of us with very little leftovers and this recipe is supposed to serve 8. If I were serving that many, I would definitely double it. It was the perfect accompaniment to char-grilled steaks and grilled asparagus.

This was a crowd pleaser. I do agree that you need to season each layer with salt & pepper. I did add fresh garlic and finely minced onion to the dish. It feed 8 people with no left overs so increase for larger group or for large eaters. I have emailed my friends this recipe!!

Excellent result, and has the advantage of simple preparation. a great substitute for scalloped potatoes when you just can't be bothered.

The finished product was delicious, but it required a lot of additional salt and pepper. Well worth making again, but next time I'll layer the potatoes in the dish in 2 or 3 layers with additional salt and pepper in between.

Every time I make this I am asked for the recipe. It's just delicious and easy if you use a mandolin for the potatoes. It's a perfect dish for company or for a formal dinner.

This is a delicious side dish that I've made countless times since it was published. Easy to make ahead. I always add some onion and garlic, and have used a variety of herbs; it's always perfect. I've given this recipe to a number of dinner guests b/c they all love it.

A great simple recipe. This goes wonderful with the pork recipe. My wife loves them both.

Very easy to prepare and delicious!! I used 1% milk and it was fine. I would even try this again usuing milk only to lower the fat and I am sure it would be good. This served excatly 8 in my house with no seconds and no leftovers so I would say increase if you have hearty eaters.

The beauty of this dish is its simplicity. Easy to assemble and a beautiful compliment to roasted meat. I subsituted half and half for the cream/milk combo and cheated with dried chives. Most of the sauce cooked up, which was fine, but I was expecting a creamier dish.

This is a very nice gratin that goes well with beef and pork. I used different herbs than the recipe called for; it would be good with any number of different seasonings. I also added some chopped red onion.

I make this all the time.. it's a perfect company meal side dish, especially with steaks in a sauce. Great standard, very elegant.

Looks like a regular potato side dish, but it came out perfectly. A good starting point to embellish with cheese, onions, etc.

I thought this was delicious. Unfortunately, it didn't go over as well as the au gratins made with cheese.

I'm sure the recipe is terrific as written but I modified it somewhat and it was great. I added several cloves of chopped garlic, about a cup of sliced onions and included parsley and rosemary with the thyme. I served it with roast duck and it was a nice accompaniment.

I love this recipe because it is quicker to make than normal gratin potatoes. Often I omit the herbs and add cheese, but I boil the potatoes in the milk to speed the cooking.

I took this to a brunch and came back with an empty dish. Followed the recipe exactly. Other herbs could be used depending on the main course. Will make again.

I'm giving this four forks for my version. I added 1 teaspoon of cayenne and 1 teaspoon minced garlicto the milk. I really reccomend you try this. Knowone could guess it was in there, but it gave a nice mellow flavor ot the potatos. I used dry thyme, rather than fresh, and it was fine. Served the dish with spirl ham, sauteed sugar snap peas and radish slices, all my guests loved it. I also tossed a handfull of shedded swiss cheese on top, but I don't think it needed it, and won't do that next time. I made it the day before, let it cool and refridgerated it. Next day I put it into a 400 degree oven for about half an hour uncovered until it bubbled. Delicious.

Delicious. I have a daughter who is allergic to cheese. If she hadn't watched me make this dish, she would have thought there was cheese in it, it's so creamy and tasty. I use red potatoes, just toss them with the herbs and seasoning, and pour the milk and cream over. You do need to make sure you add lots of seasoning, but these are so yummy.

Very mediocre, for all the calories and supposed richness, very little flavor. I would not make again and would not recommend to friends.

followed the recipe exactly, but was rather bland. maybe mushrooms would add some flavor.

I made this lovely potato side-dish on Christmas eve and served with a slow roasted ham. It was delicious beyond compare. There were 5 of us and the recipe was almost not enough! It has become our new Christmas Eve tradition.

A good and tasty recipe. I don't think it's necessary to bring the mixture to a boil first. Next time I'll just combine the ingredients and put in the oven. Goes very nicely with the pork roast recommended. Will definitely make again.

very simple to make, made it for a potluck and it had to be reheated , I was very pleased with how it retained the moisture and creaminess

Excellent dish. Combined with the musterd herb pork roast it makes a great meal. Used 2 1/2 cups half & half instead of the cream and milk and it worked out fine.

It's a delicious change from scalloped potatoes and easy to make. For a less fattening dish, try substituting soy milk for the cream. It won't spoil the flavor, still very creamy and much healthier.

This potato dish is delicious! Intending to half the recipe, I did half the potatos and then got sidetracked and made the full "sauce" recipe. What a wonderful mistake--they were delicious and very creamy! My children loved them along side the pork with mustard coating that was recommended with them.

At last a potato recipe my husband loves. He only likes Roasted or Mashed Potatoes. For years I have been trying different recipes for potatoes without success until now. Best potatoes he has ever had. I must say I really do agree with him. I am planning to make this again for a family function in a few weeks time. So easy and so fattening. Yum

Fattening but well worth it. So simple and absolutely delicious - I can't wait to wow more people with it.
