I've made this every fall for three years now and think it is a great dessert. I did have a problem this time, because I made the cake layer on Sunday for a Tuesday pot luck at work. I followed the instructions exactly, but the sponge had deflated a bit, and was difficult to remove from the foil. Although I will make it again, I won't make it ahead. The pecans and crystallized ginger make the dessert.

Absolutely fabulous and easy recipe. Have made it twice to unanimous raves. The ginger taste is pronounced and goes well with pecans. If you buy good quality ginger, it will be a winner.

The candied Ginger flavor was too strong. I did not enjoy this cake at all.

I must say that the most difficult part of this recipe was getting the aluminum off of the bottom. I suggest putting the cake in the frig or on the porch (if it's cold enough). This will firm up the cake and make it a little easier to work with. This dish is great for Thanksgiving. The ginger taste closely reminds me of pumpkin pie.

Very easy, nice presentation and delicious. Do not leave out the glazed nuts...they make this dish.

This dish reminds of Christmas-- it's spicy and delicious! We served it with pralines and cream ice cream, which complemented the roulade very nicely.

This recipe is very easy to make. I served it at a Christmas dinner party for 14 people. Everyone loved it. I made a slight modification to the recipe. In deference to my chocoholic friends, I poured a thin chocolate ganache over the cake before adding the pecans. The flavors complement each other deliciously.

This cake was excellent and not as difficult as it appeared. It looked just like the picture! The crystallized ginger in the filling gave it a delicious and unusual flavor. A big hit with my family and guests.
