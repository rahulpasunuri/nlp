This sauce was excellent! I served it over broiled salmon and sauteed summer squash. The lemon juice really transformed the sauce - I tried it before and after adding the lemon. I also used a food processor to blend the ingredients, it made a nice, thick puree.

Very flavorful - not for the picky eater. I served this over baked/broiled salmon. It was very good. It is a good balance for salmon.

This sauce was pretty simple to make and featured lovely, complex flavors, but had two problems with it: firstly, it browned pretty quickly after I made it, something that really put a damper on presentation. The recipe calls for adding in the lemon juice just before serving; not sure why that is, because it seems that adding it in immediately might help keep it the pretty green that is the whole point of blanching the herbs in the first place. Secondly, drizzled it on top of salmon, and it had a choppy, dry look, not the smooth, glossy look of a restaurant sauce. For these reasons, probably will not try this again despite the tastiness.

This is a simple, delicious sauce. I use a dribble of it alongside scallops or other seafood. Very simple to make -- I use the pre-chopped tubes of herbs found in the produce section. The portions of the brand I use work out exactly. I keep some frozen so that it's always on hand. Excellent, strong flavors.

This is a great staple to have on hand. I make a huge quantity (try your local restaurant supply store for cheap cilantro) and freeze portions. It complements many foods and makes a quick and tasty dinner.

This sauce was so yummy and easy to make.. I made with halibut and roasted veggies.. will definately make again. I added extra pepper flakes as we like it spicy

Unbelievably yummy! so easy to make and was awesome with the halibut. I put the halibut on a bed of pico di gallo, spread the sauce on the fish, wrapped in parchment and baked at 350 for 15 minutes - delicious!

This a fabulous sauce. Instead of hot pepper flakes, I use a little chipotle in adobo for the heat, and it works beautifully. I use this sauce with broiled salmon and the combination is wonderful!

Love the idea, not so sure about the execution. Somehow the cumin seeds didn't make it from the grocery store to my house, so I used 3/4 tsp. ground cumin instead (to make up for any flavor loss). I also upped the red pepper to 1/2 tsp. The end result was too strong on the soy sauce and had a little too much herbaceous bitterness for my taste. Maybe I didn't blanch the parsley and cilantro long enough? Still, it turned a blah fish dish into a wow fish dish, so I'll tweak and keep trying.

I made this sauce to go with the cilantro chicken bites. It was a huge hit. I had leftovers the next day, it gets a little overwhelming on day two.

I added 1 1/2 cups frozen mango chunks and 2 tbsp rice vinegar and whirred it all in a blender. I also subsituted lime juice for lemon juice. The flavor really popped! The mango made the sauce almost creamy. I then used this as a dipping sauce for seared scallops on a skewer for an appetizer party I hosted. RAVE reviews made this way.

This recipe is delicious. I wasn't sure what to expect when first starting the recipe but it is exactly like the sauce I've had many times at Tamarind in London. I made it to go with filets but ended up spreading most of it on the Naan bread I served with a salad before dinner.

I used the sauce with baked haddock. It's quite piquant but well-balanced. Mixing it with cream cheese might make a mean sandwich spread or dip. It enlivens plain fish or chicken.

The sauce was a hit with grilled shrimp. I followed the recipe to the letter but thought the soy sauce was a bit strong. I will cut it in half next time.

Great sauce. Tasted along the lines of pesto, but with no fat. Served it with grilled shrimp over pasta.

Very good sauce. I made it to serve with the 'chicken and cilantro bites' from this site, which weren't all that great on their own and were saved only by this sauce.

This sauce is so flexible! It's wonderful over rotini in a pasta salad. It is also a great base for a cream sauce - super on grilled chicken. Instead of stirring in lemon juice, I slightly reduce about 1/2 cup of cream in the pan used to cook the shallots, then stir the cilantro mix from the blender into the cream and cook over medium heat for a few minutes.

I love this sauce, and agree with others that it's good on just about anything. I freeze leftover sauce in an ice-cube tray, then keep the frozen cubes in a freezer bag. It keeps very well that way, and I can unfreeze a cube or two to make an impromptu dinner for guests or just my family more interesting, elegant, and yummy.

Loved it. Would make it for guests would make it for family, everyone enjoys the fresh flavors. Very easy to prepare.

I love this recipe but after the first time I tried it, I got rid of the parsley altogether and used only cilantro! Just a taste preference around here. Yum!

Woo-Hoo! This is a too-die-for sauce recipe! Used it over a grilled New York steak and it was scrumptous! The flavor is full of delights but not overpowering! My hubby said that he thought that he was in a restaurant. Just follow it to a "t" and you'll get raves too! Thanks to everyone on this board who recommended it!

This is truly one of my favorite things to make, everyone is always amazed by the flavor of this sauce. I make it with grilled halibut and coconut gingerroot rice (recipe found on this site), and whatever vegetable looks the freshest at the market. I think that this is easy to make...you won't believe how flavorful this is!

This is definitely going into my standard rotation. I made it with the recommended Halibut recipe - but it would be great on many things. A crowd pleaser.

Oh, Wow, yum yum yum. My boyfriend is a vegetarian, but I try not to let that stop me from trying recipes that sound really good- I made this one with tempeh, grilled with zucchini, mushrooms and little olive oil- it was fantastic. Would have been even better on fish, but I was not in the mood to cook 2 separate entrees. This one's a winner for veggies and carnivores alike.

This is a great sauce for chicken, meat or fish. It is a bit time consuming but well worth the effort. It keeps well and great in the summer for grilled meats!

Thumbs up from my BBQ friends and husband. Grilled the halibut on the BBQ and served it with asian noodles (tossed with some of the sauce, sesame oil, and sesame seeds). Provided an air of sophistication to the usual BBQ fare. Not to mention healthy.

Anything that combines garlic, ginger, and cilantro is always good in my book. What I found especially enjoyable about this sauce was the addition of the red pepper flakes; it definitely gave it some kick (I used more than it called for in the recipe and it still wasn't too spicy). I didn't try this with the intended halibut recipe, but rather served it with fajitas as a condiment for my diet-conscious mother. It was a big hit!

I will just add to the chorus. This is a fantastic sauce. I made it with the halibut and roasted vegetable recipe. It's tangy and delicious. I made it a day ahead, but didn't add the lemon juice until the last minute.

Absolutely delicious, great on any fish, shrimp or chicken! A Make ahead and bring to room temp prior to serving sauce!! Keeper/crowd pleaser

This sauce is so great! It tastes sort of Indonesian which was a nice surprise. I made it in the morning and the flavor was even better, but the color suffered a little (maybe because I put in the lemon by mistake). Next time instead of blanching the cilantro and parsley I think I will make the sauce and then blend in the parsley and cilantro right before serving. Yum, can't wait to put this on everything.

Wow, this is so yummy. Made it exactly as is and served it with peppered, seared tuna steaks--it was to die for! Also served brown rice cooked with a little bit of fresh orange juice and cooked carrots in a honey/pepper glaze. The sauce really made the meal!

This sauce is outstanding. Easy to vary the spice level with peppers, garlic, and ginger. It is terrific on pepper-crusted seared tuna.

This goes very well with anything. I don't own a food processor, so I chopped everything fine, by hand, and it was wonderful.

I didn't make the halibut and veggie dish that the sauce accompanied, but the sauce over any white fish is delicious. My family told me that the recipe was an A+ and we would definitely make it again.

This sauce is easy to make and would be excellent with any white fish. I did make it with the suggested halibut and root veggies, but would have prefered it with green vegetables or a salad with the fish.

I've made this quite a few times, and it's always a hit. Usually serve it with halibut grilled in foil with salt, pepper and slices of lemon. I add more ginger, more red pepper flakes, a bit of olive oil and a little less soy sauce.

I made the sauce a second time and served it with BBQ salmon and it was great. Wonderful flavor which is great all all types of vegetables. I love it!

Lovely piquant sauce. I thought the soy sauce prevailed a little too much but I still liked it alot. I would always serve it with a rice or Asian noodle accompaniment. It might go well with chicken also.

This sauce was incredibly tasty, and was a perfect match for the halibut. I made this last night and am already craving it again today!

this is wonderful with halibut - I followed the recipe exactly and it easy to make.
