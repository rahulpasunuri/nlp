I don't want to give a fork rating as I used this for a starting point for a Mexi-"lasagne". It came out great, it's a wonderful way to use leftover meat & veggies & make it interesting.

Wanting to make something very budget-friendly this week for dinner, we decided to make this, and it was definitely a keeper! Recipe is more like a framework, and it just needed a few embellishments to be fab. Low on the "messing up kitchen" scale, easy 15 minute prep, and great leftovers. Added sauteed onions, green pepper and garlic to the ground beef (1 lb was plenty), made sure to moisten the tortillas with some broth and juice from the tomatoes, added cilantro, several chili-type spices incl chipotle chili powder. This was not at all bland, and our unexpected company who stopped by and ate with us (a grad from culinary institute) said it was, "amazing". This one's going in the recipe box.

Very Hearty. Quick and easy to make. I did add green enchilada sauce over the top before putting it in the oven. Thought this would make it more moist and it worked! I did follow others and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and thought it added more zing to the flavor. Would make again.

I thought this recipe was really good; I'd give it 3 forks on the dish alone, 4 for how easy it was! Something I put together Sunday night to have ready to throw in the oven for our busy Monday dinner. The only thing I did differently was I did not use stewed mexican tomatoes; instead I used fresh tomatoes and canned green chilies. I thought it was a bit dry, probably because of that, and am trying to figure out how I might remedy for next time. Definitely a recipe that can be played with for your tastes. Enjoy it!

I used all your great comments and it turned out fantastic! I doubled the recipe except used 3 lbs of lean ground beef instead of 4. I also poured a 14.5 can of enchilada sauce over the corn tortillas and then layered. Used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and added cumin, coriander, oregano, paprika, garlic, cinnamon and mild green chilies.I used black beans instead of chili. made this along w/ steak fajitas for a party of 50. No leftovers! Will definitely do again. Thanks for all your comments!

I have been making this for years. Good comfort food in the cold months. I use taco seasoning in place of the chili powder, dip corn tortillas in enchilida sauce before layering, and use 2 cans of diced Rotel tomotoes w/diced jalapenos in place of stewed tomatoes. I also skip the add'l can of jalapenos as that would be too much heat for my kids.

I think this version of the recipe should be replaced with an update...I didn't even try it as written! Added lots of spices to the meat, some veggies, cheese - a jumping off point at best.

I should have read the reviews for the recipe before I made it. The original recipe as is was a little bland. It looked nice but wasn't much on flavor. I think with some of the additions made here such as seasoning the meat and adding additional ingredients would have helped this a lot!

I made it according to recipe...and made a pan to freeze. That was 2 months ago...the frozen pan is still in the freezer. I guess this just isn't my cup of tea. I didn't like the *pastey* taste to it. Even my 11 yr old wasn't crazy on it.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this came out looking exactly like dog food. I thought it tasted hideous, but my oh-so-sweet teenage son ate all of it and went for seconds. He said he didn't care what it looked like! I gave it two forks for that. :-)

Loved it. Didn't want the beans, but sauted a large diced bell pepper with onion & beef(1 1/2 lb). Softened tortillas w/a little canola oil in non-stick pan. Used grated monterey jack over meat. Covered all w/Hatch mild red enchilada sauce w/grated sharp cheddar & olives. SHOULD HAVE put some sauce on bottom of pan as the tortillas got VERY crisp. Made vinegary red cabbage slaw & sliced avocado. Deeelicious.

I found this recipe to be very good.... If my boyfriend who is Mexican enjoyed it, then it's a winner in this household. I did make some changes. I dipped the tortillas that I had cut in half in enchilada sause and doubled them for each layer. Once the meat and onions were cooked, I added two taco season packages with the required amount of water. I stirred in the beans to the meat and layered the mixture on top of the tortillas. Next topping the mixture with cheese then mexican corn. I added a second layer the same as the first. I topped this last layer with 1 can of the mexican style stewed tomatoes and 1 can of rotel tomatoes, juice and all. After it had baked for 45 minutes I sprinkled a top layer of Monterey Jack cheese and place back in the oven for approx 10 minutes. This recipe made enough for a 13x9 pan and also a small loaf pan to freeze for another night. I find it a challenge to find different Mexican dishes that my sweetie will enjoy and I must say, this was a winner.

I used everyone's suggestions and added my own by using 1 cube of Knorr's chipotle along with the black beans and green chilis. Everyone liked it and it's hard to impress people in this town.

I have learned to read other cooks' comments every time; they are often helpful. I wanted a recipe like this but immediately thought it would need more "spicing up." The other cooks' ideas are right on the mark. What I did: made this with Chef Dean Fearing's Turtle Creek black beans layered over the meat. Very easy: cook 3 strips bacon (chopped), add 2 cans black beans (rinsed), chopped onion & garlic & jalapeno, 2 cups chicken broth, simmer 20 minutes or 'til liquid is cooked down. The flavor is fantastic, and it works perfectly in this casserole.

I've made this several times now, but with a few modifications. I dip the corn tortillas in canned enchilada sauce and use the remaining enchilada sauce to pour over the top in place of one can of tomatotes. I didn't have any tomatoes once so substituted salsa. I even used some leftover holiday turkey in place of the beef and it was still great. My co-workers and husband LOVE this.

The dish was enhanced by serving with sour cream and chopped green onions. I would use diced tomatoes rather than stewed the next time.

This is definately "kid food". My eleven year old loved it, gave it four forks. I thought it was bland but edible, only deserving two forks. We compromised on the rating. I'll make it again because the youngster asked, but next time I'll pump up the flavor with fresh garlic, poblanos, extra beef stock and lots of red pepper flakes.

Rating: 3
Good. Everyone liked it, which is unusual in my house. I made many of the same substitutions/additions as other reviewers--garlic, cilantro, packaged taco seasoning in the meat (also added a dollop of Trader Joe's Chipotle Grilling Sauce); dipped tortillas in enchilada sauce; used diced tomatoes with green chilis in place of stewed; black beans, and pre-packaged shredded Mexican cheese blend. Also added a whole bag of frozen southwest-mix veggies (beans, corn, onion, poblano chilis, diced pepper) to the layers (could have skipped one can of black beans because of this addition). Needed just a bit more moisture; next time I'll use the 1/4 cup water the taco seasoning packet calls for in the meat mixture, and add more cheese to the layers.

Rating: 3
This was easy and delicious. I added an extra layer of tortillas and meat to break up the amount of meat it made. I thought the recipe might turn out to be dry, but it wasn't at all. Also I used 3/4 of a can of mild green chilis instead of the jalapeno.

This was good--I added green peppers, more chili powder, cumin, coriander, oregano and paprika. I also used refried beans and added some enchilada sauce.

I dont know why people where saying this was bland. This was way too spicy for me. I'll probably make this again but no where near as much ground chili. My instincts told me 1/4 of a cup was too much so I only put in 1/8 but that was still too much.

I tried this recipe for a potluck dinner at my church...I got rave reviews! The only thing that I will do differently is to maybe add more spice to it...it was a bit bland...

A very solid 3-1/2. I made it for our annual Mexican Easter bbq and I was worried that it might be bland or soggy so I did take just about everyone's suggestions. I added a few cloves of garlic, used 1-1/4 ground turkey, more onion, a red pepper, a bag of taco seasoning and a can of green chilis and some corn. I also cut the tortillas, dipping them in enchilada sauce and used 2 cans of rotel on the top. Used a cup or so more cheese and one more can beans. Made it for 2 guests but 6 neighbors ended up stopping by and the dish was demolished. I know certain people hate reviews with substitutions but this did the trick. Thanks to all those before me!!

I agree that this isn't the most groundbreaking recipe in the world, but I thought it tasted great! I added black beans, lots of zucchini and corn, enchilada sauce, and extra layers of tortillas. On a student budget, this was a hell of a lot better than macaroni and cheese, and made enough to keep me eating for a week.

Not quite 4 forks with the recipe as is. I added garlic, cumin and some dried cilantro to the groud beef. I also added a layer of sweet corn. And during the last 20 minutes I added a little bit of grated montery jack to the top. I used another reviewers suggestion and cut the tortillas up as well, which made for easier layering (and to get it into the corners of the dish). I also served it with a dollup of sour cream. Next time I may try adding some more veggies as well as making the tortilla layers thicker (two layers instead on just one). Overall very good and got great raves from those who enjoyed it.

I made some modifications to this dish also, mainly because I needed to get rid of the left over turkey from Christmas, I also substituted rotel tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes. It was really good and my husband also loved it!!

I used two cans of black beans instead of chili breans, and two lbs. of ground turkey meat. I dipped each tortilla in enchilada sauce, which added much needed moisture to the casserole. I also added fresh cilantro and chopped serrano chiles, for some flavor. I topped each serving with fat free sour cream and fresh avacado (blended with a fork and a squirt of lemon juice). I had two layers in my casserole and received rave reviews from my family. We will definitely make this again. I may add black olive slices to the layers. I do recommend it. The leftovers were great for lunch the next day!

To lighten this dish, I reduced the meat to 1/2. I added a small can of corn and a can of rinsed black beans. Also, I added 2 small cans of chilies. I didn't have the corn tortillas, so I used Dorita chips instead. I just broke them up a bit. The taste was great and it was wonderful for lunch at work the next day!

I have made this dish on several occasions. It is very easy to make, and I like the idea of easy casseroles after a long day at work. I substitute extra hot Rotels for the Mexican-style stewed tomatoes and pinto beans for the chili beans. This dish is great on a cold winter night - the smell is wonderful! My husband just loves it.

My four-year-old son and I loved this dish. Of course, I made some modifications (thanks to the previous reviewers!). First, I used ground turkey breast instead of ground beef; I cooked it in taco seasoning and added a can of diced chilis. I tried dipping the tortillas in enchilada sauce before putting them in the dish, and made several layers of turkey, black beans, enchilada sauce, and cheese (light on the cheese). I topped it off with Ro-tel Mexican Fiesta, and it was terrific. Definitely a new staple in our meal rotation.

I made this for a friend who just had a baby, and both of our families loved it! Granted, I added my own embellishments, and made a few substitutions because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand, but it was great! I only used 1 can of tomatoes (diced, not stewed) and 1 can of sauce, which I simmered with a little cinnamon, oregano, chili powder & sugar while the beef browned. Also substituted 1 can diced green chilis for the jalapeno, and San Antonio-style black beans for the chili beans. Excellent!

It's a great family dinner! My husband really loved it, and I enjoyed the leftovers for lunch (rare for me). My son was so-so with it. Maybe if I left the jalapeno out while cooking and used it as an optional topping, he'd have liked it better, but he's only 2. I will definitely make this again.

I also made a few changes. Instead of layering the tortilla shells, I filled them with the beef and bean mixture and rolled them like burritos to go into the pan. Then I covered with the cheese and tomatoes. It was delicious.

I simply loved this dish! I used 1 can of RoTel and 1 can of enchilada sauce instead of the Mexican stewed tomatoes and added some chopped green chiles.

My whole family loved this casserole. Since my husband does not care for beans, I substituted corn instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again soon and incorporate some of the changes others have suggested.

This looked too easy to be any good. What a surprise! My only changes were I used less ground beef and added some chorizo (spicy Mexican sausage) and I used one can red enchilada sauce along with the other can of Mexican stewed tomatoes. I used only 1 Tbs. chili powder in light of these changes. It makes a lot and I took the left overs to the office the next day and it was inhaled by co-workers. I passed around the recipe to everyone at our office AND the office next door (they could smell it while reheating in our microwave!)

Super dooper delicious dish, but the cook should alter it to satisfy his or her intended meal-eater-uppers. For my bunch, I had to cut the meat way back (about 3/4 pound) and change it to ground turkey, substitute enchilada sauce for the stewed tomatoes, throw in a truckload of olives, and use three (yes -three!) cups of sharp cheddar. I also built up layers with the tortillas, so it was truly like lasagne. As long as you play with it to satisfy your cravings, you can't go wrong - it even reheats fabulouso!

This is great! Easy, fast and filling. Had it for a group who loves to go back for more and they did. Added garlic and sercved with sour cream. The rest of dinner was ceaser salad and home made corn bread. I'll do this again and pass it on to friends. Shirley Aries Mercer Island, Wash (Please no e-mail address)

My husband and I really liked this recipe. He even admitted that he didn't pick out all the tomatoes. I substitued a can of Ro-Tels for the tomatoes on the top. The next time I try this, I think that I will use the enchilada sauce suggestions. I also will try it with shredded chicken.

I benefited by other people's suggestions and I think this dish turned out the better because of it. I quartered corn tortillas and dipped them in enchilada sauce before layering them. Instead of tomatoes, I used hot salsa. My own contribution was chopped fresh cilantro and sliced black olives to the meat mixture.

This dish was a good sucess. I made it on an evening when I had an errand to run during my normal "make dinner" time. Advance preperation took about 30 minutes. Then I left my husband idiot-proof instructions and it turned out wonderfully. Our five year old, who hates salsa and anything else he deems "spicy" had his piece gone in under five minutes with no complaints. This dish is relatively simple and tastes great. Asthetically, it looks great coming out of the oven. A great dish.

I love this recipe! It's quick and easy, and re-heats very well (great to deliver to new moms, etc.) I made two changes: I used 1/2 to 2/3 of the beef called for, and I use either salsa or Delmonte tomatoes with jalapenos instead of plain stewed tomatoes. If you like things spicy, use all salsa for sure. Also, can be done with flour tortillas if you're out of corn. Someone commented that 1/4 cup of chili powder must be a typo -- it definitely ISN'T. Use it for sure, plus some of your other faves if you like it spicy. The torillas turn out moist -- some would say soggy -- but taste delicious because they've absorbed the dishes flavors. Play around and add your favorite Mexican items.

This recipe was delicious! Instead of the ground beef I boiled tri-tip until very tender and shredded the meat into strings. SKIP the beans, yuk!,and instead of the chili powder I used a can of enchilada sauce. The tortillas must first be fried in hot oil, then coated in the enchilada sauce, then instead of just layering the tortilla, I rolled the beef, cheese,added black olives onions and tomatoes in the tortillas and lined the baking dish, then covered with more sauce and grated cheeses and bla ck olives. Yum

Alright, MY version is a three forker!! I ditch the canned tomatoes and kidney beans and use canned enchilada sauce, extra cheese, garlic, olives and onion. I dip the torts in the heated sauce and layer it up. I saute the meat with the onion and carlic and spice it up with ancho chili paste. I throw sliced black olives in on every layer with more gooey cheese. Right before I do the next layer I spoon on extra enchilada sauce. I often make this with chicken stewed in adobo sauce. Let it sit for 10 or so minutes before cutting or it does not hold its shape. Serve with Sour Cream and some good salsa. You could also add cilantro. There are a million versions. Great for crowds. Fun to make.

To avoid sogginess, drain fat frim meat , drain canned beans and stewed tomatoes. Afree with others that this needs zipping up. We used half salsa and half stewed tomatoes on top and sprinkled liberally with fresh coriander before serving. We added a dollop if sour cream to balancr the hot salsa topping. Guacamole would work great also.

I thought this would be a quick and filling dinner for my 3 boys. They usually love "Mexican." It was awful. The tortillas either were soggy or hard as a rock. It had no flavor. I caught myself spooning extra hot salsa on top of my portion. I should have read the reviews first....

Once I got past the word "casserole" I was attracted to the simplicity of this dish, so I got started. This casserole is, well, simply awful. After browning and seasoning the ground beef I tasted it, and it had absolutely no flavor. I added two more jalapenos and almost a half bottle of Tabasco sauce before there was anything to taste! The final result was equally disappointing, as the cheese/tomato mixture on the top congealed into an unknown substance upon baking. There are a lot of great recipes here; stay far away from this one, unless you recently donated your taste buds to science.
