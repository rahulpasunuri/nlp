This is a great way to season any roast. I was going to get prime rib, but it was just too expensive. My butcher suggested a tri tip roast, which was just two cuts that he tied together so it would roast uniformly. I got about 3.5 pounds and that was plenty for a dinner party of 6 people (it probably would have easily served 8). I still used the mustard and pepper, and roasted the beef for about 45 minutes at 375. It turned out AMAZING - medium rare deliciousness. The cut wasn't fatty enough to create enough juices to make a good pan sauce, but the meat was plenty moist so it really didn't need any sauce. The best part? The roast only cost $25, and that was from a fancy butcher shop.

This was fabulous for a New Years Eve dinner. I purchased dry aged beef and it was excellent. Also purchased the beef and veal broth from the butcher and used that instead of canned. The recipe is easy to follow and the prime rib was awesome. Served with caramelized shallot mashed potatoes.

This was divine. I skipped the brandy/congac and used red wine. That was fine. I also accidently purchased a ribless roast (yes, 9 lbs worth) and besides having WAY too much meat, it was delicious. Note, however, that it cooked only 2 hours before being medium rare that way. Everyone loved it, and we've been eating roast beef sandwiches all week to try to finish off the rest of the meat.

WOW! Our Family Christmas Dinner is always Prime Rib. We started by ordering the meat from a local butcher shop. The recipe is for a 9 lbs. roast but I had a 20 lbs roast, so I doubled the recipe. The one thing my grandmother always told me was Beef needs Garlic so, in her honor I plugged the roast with 2 large garlic cloves...something the recipe doesnt call for and I generously salted and peppered the rib side of the roast as well. The fat side was dusted with salt and fresh ground pepper. I cheated and used the frozen garlic cubes (love those things)...because who really wants to mince a head of garlic anyway. I would stay away from the jared garlic as its flavor isnt as fresh. I also didnt crush the peppercorns. I just used my pepper grinder on a loose setting and it worked out just fine. My family loved this recipe and I dont think I will ever make Prime Rib any other way. My husband doesnt care for this type of dinner (he gets his favorite sandwich tomorrow) but even he said he liked the flavor! Enjoy!

Beautiful & delicious Easter dinner ! I used a 2 bone 5 lb roast, used the wrap in cheese cloth and dry in the refrig for 4 or 5 days method. Used 1 cup of water and a cup of beef stock in the pan with cut onions. The roast must be at room temp.(left it in cheesecloth on the counter for 3 to 4 hours) and watch the temp carefully. I didn't have any brandy but the au jus was wonderful. Read the reviews, great tips.

Amazing. This is now my go-to Prime Rib recipe. I served this at Christmas to a group of 10. It got rave reviews from all. The au jus is off the charts. We loved it so much we made it again for New Years. With the leftovers, try this...I cut ciabatta bread into 4" squares and then sliced them open. Brush with olive oil and broil till lightly toasted. Rub with a fresh garlic clove. Pile it high with thinly sliced leftover prime rib. Use the au jus as the dipping sauce. The best French Dip ever!

I've made prime ribs many different ways, and this recipe is the one I always come back to for special occasions. I've been making it for 10 years. It always gets rave reviews, even from my chef friends, and it is so spectacularly easy. Making sure the meat is at room temp when you start, letting the rub sit on the meat for awhile before it goes in the oven, and adding a little beef broth to the pan when the temperature is turned down are the big secrets to the best possible result. Don't be afraid of all the mustard and garlic -- the flavors mellow with cooking.

This recipe is awesome. I DID have to cover with foil to prevent the crust from browning too much before the meat was ready and the timing was perfect for my picky about prime rib inlaws- they got their med-rare, I got my a little more cooked end piece and this from now on will be my ONLY PR recipe- just perfect! My inlaws said it was like butter (used the 4 rib)

Rating: 4
I have made this twice, both with exceptional results. The simple ingredients make and amazingly complex 'crust' that does not overpower the the succulence of this favorite cut of meat. To get the proper results it is imperative that the roast be at room temperature before it goes in the oven. Use your instant read meat thermometer to insure the inside of the roast is as close to 65-68 degrees as possible.

Rating: 4
I made this over the holidays - twice. Turned out perfect both times. First time, I used "choice" instead of "prime" and it turned out as well, if not better, than the prime. Less fat in the choice - for those of us watching our weight - and less $$$. I'd make it again with "choice".

Perfect! I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday and it was absolutely delicious. My sister said it was the best prime rib she'd ever had in her life. (And she's not one for superlatives.) I added a little mustard and heavy cream to the sauce for some extra decadence. Can't wait to serve it next Christmas--if I can wait that long.

I had never cooked prime rib before, but with the family getting tired of turkey we decided to go with something different for Christmas dinner. This was amazing, and extremely simple. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added beef broth to the pan, after the initial roasting, which made for plenty of pan juices for the sauce. The finished product was gobbled up by the family, with lots of praise going along with eating.

This was easy and such a crowd pleaser! I made for Christmas dinner and think it will now be a Christmas tradition. The only change I made was using port instead of Cognac and I roasted it about 20 minutes longer since the majority of my crowd prefers medium to medium rare. It came out absolutely perfect!

If you can not find a butcher who has dry aged prime rib, you can dry age the prime rib yourself, if you have adequate refrigerator space. Simply remove the prime rib from the plastic and place it in your refrigerator after you have wrapped it with two to three layers of cheese cloth. To prevent the cheese cloth from sticking to the rib, unwrap and rewrap the cheese cloth after the first day. I have found that the optimim lenght of time for aging is seven days. Prior to applying the your seasonings, you will need to carve off the dryed and hard fat and/or meat. Try to leave as much fat as possible. During the process of aging, you will lose 15% to 20% of the prime rib's initial weight, but the flavor and tenderness you are left with is outstanding. I also always order three to four ribs from the loin end, you will end up with less fat and more meat.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe twice during the holidays, once with a boneless 6lb prime rib roast and the other with a 3lb bone in roast. Both were delish but for ease of carving you can beat a boneless roast. I roasted both on a rack after having covered the entire roast with the mustard/garlic/pepper mixture. I would highly recommend a quick read meat thermometer since cooking times will vary greatly based on the cut of meat, the size of the roast and oven variability. Everyone on Christmas raved that it was the best prime rib they'd ever had.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish over and over and it always comes out fabulous. I always put slits in the meat and insert slices of garlic and just add the mustard and peppercorns to the outside of the roast. Also, to establish more pan juices, after lowering the temperature add about 3/4 cup of beef broth to the pan. The juices will then go into the broth and not evaporate. All in all a fabulouse prime rib. Will be preparing it again for Christmas 2006.

Rating: 4
Oops, I forgot a few factors that I thought were important before, I had the burcher trim the roast and remove the rib bone and tie it back on (it just makes it so much easier to deal with, yet you still get the bone flavorings which add so much). Also, I also didn't get alot of pan juices to deal with- but just pressed on with (added abit of olive oil to the pan while the pan juices where in the freezer to get things moving), but this recipe is just so good, get the crust on the prime rib going and do whatever to the au jus (sp?)- whoever has the pleasure will be pleased. Oh yeah, use Sea Salt, it is sooooooo much better for you and the prime rib--- gosh sounds like I did not make the same recipe, but follow the basics with this one and you cannot go wrong.

Rating: 4
Oh my! Wonderful!! I followed recipe exactly except (always the exceptions) the cooking time in recipe a bit long, took my 8.9 lb roast out after 2hrs and 20 minutes. I will confess I was getting a bit nervous and put a cover on the roast for about 20 mins. or so. Also, completely innocently I forgot to add the extra peppers to the reduction sauce, and I did add some baby bellas as well when I was sauteeing the shallots. I also used a very good courvoiseire(sp?)cognac. Anyway, my husband was extremely grateful for my efforts. I took my roast out after 2hrs and 20 mins. and I was extremely conscious of the temp. the entire time. When I took it out and foiled it (not that loose), I had time to prepare the rest of the meal. Covering the meat raised the temp. by a good 5 to 10 degrees within 20- 30 mins. Served it with Yukon Gold Wasabi mashed potatos, asparagus, Ceasar salad, and wild cherry jello mixed with tart frozen cherries and real whipped cream. I have made prime rib roasts before and the real trick is not to underestimate the temp. raise when you take the meat out of the oven, you need to let it rest 15 to 20 minutes anyway to let the juices reconstitute and this raises the temp. in the whole roast in the mean time. the time on this roast is a bit too long - maybe due to other issues, but don't overcook this. I have never , ever had prime rib in any restaurant that equals this. Well, I guesss, 'nuff said.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was fantastic. Everyone said it was the best prime rib they ever had. The pepper might look like alot on the meat and in the au jus, but it really isn't.

This one is an absolute classic and probably our new Christmas tradition!

Absolutely incredible. I served this for Christmas Day dinner. Everyone loved it, saying it was the best prime rib I've ever made. Like other reviewers I had very little pan juice so had to make up the difference with canned broth. It was a little salty for my taste so added a bit more cognac and a few tablespoons of unsalted butter to smooth the flavors out. I also strained the sauce prior to serving. Fortunately we had leftovers to enjoy for several days afterwards. MMM good.

Oh my. Made 2 prime ribs for a Christmas Eve dinner party with 12 guests. Both were superb; my meat thermometer broke 45 minutes into the cooking time (how unlucky is that?) so we guessed and pulled them after 2 hours & 15 minutes - perfectly medium rare. I added sliced portabella to the au jus (thanks for the tip, previous reviewers) and like many others, didn't have enough juices left in the roasting pan to follow the au jus part of the recipe. I just added my broth, shallots, portabellas and brandy to the roasting pan and scraped up all the yummy bits while reducing. It was just divine and my guests couldn't stop saying how wonderful it was. My first ever attempt at prime rib and I've been asked for it to be a Christmas Eve tradition from now on.

This was a great recipe. Made it for Christmas dinner. I did make a few small changes. I pepered the beef the day before - no salt - just pepper, salt will make the juices run - and let it sit. My guests are not big garlic fans so I blanched the garlic in boiling water for a few minutes to mellow it - still gave a good garlic flavor, but did not over power. I gave a good sprinkling of sea salt after spreading the mustard mixutre and pepper - salt immediately before putting in oven I roasted at 450 for 25 minutes and then turned it down to 300 for the remaining cooking time. For the jus, I had a godd port wine and used that instead of brandy - and sweet wine or fortified wine works fine. Everyone really loved it. Was a departure from the normal Christmas Turkey.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner, 1998. It was wonderful. The mustard, garlic and pepper made a crispy shell that added spice, without being too spicy.

The only thing I would caution is that the shallot/broth mixture is a great addition, but it's not an actual gravy. People expecting to have a thick sauce should modify it accordingly.
