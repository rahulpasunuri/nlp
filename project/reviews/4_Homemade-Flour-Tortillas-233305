I had never made tortillas at home before, but this recipe worked like a charm. I used half butter half shortening in place of the lard, and cooked them in a dry cast-iron skillet. The texture was amazing.

These are simply amazing. Amazing! And so easy. This is the second time I have made them. Like many others, I used a combination of butter/shortening - 2 TBS each. I followed the recipe exactly after that. I rolled the tortillas pretty thin and got 10 "soft taco" size tortillas. I also cooked them in a cast iron skilled. I will definitely be making these again, they were so easy. We used them to make quesadillas that were out of this world.

I love Mexican food and really like is homemake tortillas. These are far the best I have ever tried. I make them and freeze a few. Great with butter right off the grill.

So simple and came out perfectly. They are exactly like store-bought versions. Used butter instead of lard and will make again instead of buying tortillas if I have the time.

My Abuelita would be proud! Well, let's hope she didn't notice the vegan shortening I used instead of lard! I found I needed a smidge more of all ingredients save for the flour. The elastic dough really makes it easy to roll out thin. I actually wanted these small for a taco bar. So, I got about 24 4" tortillas a batch. I will most definitely make again. FYI- make sure your water IS warm, that's what helps make it elasticy. I chucked my first batch of dough because the water wasn't warm enough, therefore the dough came out dry and the edges were cragged. The first tortilla was more like a stale cracker!

delicious made with all olive oil (all we had...). mine were gringa-thick, but oh so tasty for our grilled fish tacos. I put a little cornmeal on the cast iron skillet I used, and liked it very much. an elastic dough has to rest for 20 minutes before you can roll it. this'll be my go-to recipe.

I will never buy tortillas again!!! So amazingly easy to make. I made the recipe as printed, and used lard. I think we got around 10 tortillas, I could have rolled them thinner. I used 2 pieces of parchment paper, then a heavy pyrex pie plate to squash the dough ball down. Then I rolled them out, turning each time. They came out quite circular and even if they weren't perfect, the "rustic" shape was a nice touch. I think I may invest in a tortilla press though. We had them with homemade carnitas , gaucamole, pico de gallo, shredded red cabbage tossed with lime juice and thinly sliced radishes. Just for a moment, we were in Mexico :o)

Excellet recipe. I have tried others without sucess. I used half butter, half shortening. They taste just like I remember as a child growing up in New Mexico.

Works just fine with butter as well. i make it without any of the special equipment, and it comes out great!

I got about 9 or 10 medium tortillas out of this recipe. I did roll them very thin. I had issues making them round, so I found it worked best to use a tortilla press to flatten rounded balls to a thick pancake to keep the form. Then I rolled them out from the center, with a turn after each roll. I used a little more than half vegetable shortening, and the rest butter, which worked well in place of lard. It also worked well to stack them, very lightly floured until ready to cook. Even my three year-old was able to roll out one thinly (if not a bit oddly shaped). I think the key is to let the dough rest, as specified--as this relaxes the gluten.

Excellent recipe! I used vegetable shortening as that was what I had to hand, and thy worked out very well. Simple to make too! I won't be going back to store-bought ones!

Delicious!!! Even with a 3 year old kneading the dough for 20 minutes and a 5 year old rolling them out (with no resting time), they came out perfect. Got 12 medium tortillas. Used lard and a lightly oiled regular skillet.

Since we moved back east from California, my boyfriend and I have been on a quest to find good Mexican cuisine. One thing I miss most are the fresh tortillas. I was always told tortillas aren't that difficult to make, but for some reason I was intimidated by the process and never gave it a try ...until now. This recipe was incredibly easy to make. I rolled the dough out as thin as possible; I think I got 9 or 10 medium sized tortillas (it could have been more, but I think someone came in and took a couple when my back was turned!) My dry cast iron skillet worked perfectly to cook them on. We filled our fresh tortillas with some recycled pot roast meat from the night before (cooked it down a bit with some spices, chilies, and tomato paste), added some cheese, black beans, grilled onions and peppers and voila --some of the best burritos we have had yet here on the east coast!

Delicious recipe - I used the drippings from cooked sausage instead of lard. I only got 6 medium-sized tortillas out of this batch... did anyone get more, larger sized ones? If so, how did you manage?

I used bacon fat and these were unbelievable. They didn't take long to make and where much much better than shop bought. We ate half of them on their own before the rest of the dinner was ready. they have a really nice rich flavour from the fat. Yum

Si son de harina ni me las calientes. An old family saying that when translated it means "if they flour tortillas dont even bother to heat them up" so better hurry before they are gone.
