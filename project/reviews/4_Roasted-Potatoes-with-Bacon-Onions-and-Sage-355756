I've prepared this recipe exactly as written and it is a hit. It goes well with pork or beef. The second time I browned brussel sprouts in the bacon fat and added them, it makes a good addition if you want to switch it up.

I made this dish for a group of hungry golf buddies. The potatoes were an amazing accompaniment to salmon grilled on cedar plank and grilled marinated flank steak. Perfect meal!

Mmm, this was really good. Made it for guests and served with a pot roast and everyone commented on how good it was.

These potatoes are INCREDIBLE! I've made this dish twice already this holiday season and each time they get polished off quickly. So delicious. Just enough bacon and butter to let you know it's something special. This isn't your typical overly heavy potato dish seen at the holidays. VERY good.

Would it work as well if I use full size potatoes and cut them to approximate the size of halved baby potatoes?
