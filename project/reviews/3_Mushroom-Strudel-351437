I made this for a huge Thanksgiving party and it was a hit! Not so hard to make even though I had never worked with phyllo before. 2 key points: I made sure all the liquid in the mushroom mixture evaporated before I began to fill the phyllo sheets to avoid potential sogginess. Once rolled up, I cut each roll into 8 pieces before baking because people commented that it was hard to cut neatly after baking. Then I baked till golden on top, cooled and put in the fridge overnight. Just reheated the next day as guests began to arrive and it was a hit!

I made these to the point right before baking the night before my party, and they were a soggy mess the next day. Perhaps the mushroom filling was too wet. I went ahead and baked them anyway, but they were just ok.

I served this appetizer at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. They wouldn't stop talking about it. Making it again for a dinner party tomorrow. De-lish.

I made significant changes so I'm not rating this, but for what I did, it was 3 stars worthy. I used rendered duck fat for all of the fat, chicken broth for the white wine and hot water, and 8 oz of baby bella mushrooms and 4 oz of white mushrooms. Like most phyllo dishes, this is definitely best best when freshly baked.

Very good, simple finger food. Be sure to move quickly when using the phyllo so the sheets don't dry out.

Very, very good. Followed recipe exactly without truffle oil. Assembling the phyllo logs on a clean kitchen towel might have helped in rolling up the strudels as it was difficult to keep them from tearing.

Creates overly-dry tubes that shatter. Might be a good appetizer with puff pastry.
