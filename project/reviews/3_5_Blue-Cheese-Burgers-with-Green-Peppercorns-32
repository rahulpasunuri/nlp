This recipe is fantastic, my husband wanted a burger with blue cheese and of course I searched this recipe base, I came across this recipe and because he is low carbing it was perfect...we both really enjoyed it and I will definatly be making this again, I did double the recipe and Im a huge fan of green peppercorns so I added a touch more... I recommend this recipe for sure. I also agree these are not kid friendly..

A nice change from the usual cheeseburger. However, I agree with other reviewers that 3 inches is too much. I made mine half that size.

Cook from Indian Rocks Beach, Fl had it right! For great flavor and moisture put the seasonings on the top and bottom of the patties and then the mustard w/ peppercorns, grn. onions and blue cheese at the end. Delicious!!

Wonderfully intense flavors--not your basic "family" burgers so beware of preparing them for younger kids. I did make 1" patties rather than 3" and they cooked properly at the recommended time and temp. We loved these!

These seemed like intriguing flavors, and they are. However, unless you like a firm texture as in meatloaf, which is what you get from mixing in the seasonings, the composition of the burger can be improved. For example, garlic and/or onion salt sprinkled on formed burgers; tops and bottoms spread with mustard; peppercorns added by a light press on both sides; green onion sprinkled on top and then cheese added for final broiling, etc. Burgers have much more flavor and moisture when very lightly formed into patties. I think it makes all the difference. The blue cheese is an excellent idea. I used gorgonzola.

These are burgers that POP with flavor! Started out with 2# chuck roast which I grounded in my food processor. It's fresher and you can control the fat content that way. Just prior to reaching the right consistency, I threw in some roasted garlic and the peppercorns. I opted to mix in the blue cheese rather then adding on top. Grilled the burgers instead of broiling which added extra smoked flavor. Served on buttered, toasted francessi steak rolls with whole grain mustard. Topped with sliced tomatoes and arugula. Add a pasta salad and you're set!

Added the blue cheese to the mixtue instead of on top. My family really enjoyed the bold flavor of these burgers.

There's a better, easier version of this called the Black and Bleu Burger. Mix ground beef with oodles of corsely ground black pepper and bleu cheese. Grill. To die for.

I believe there is an error in this recipe in the measurement of the patties. Note thickness. ???
