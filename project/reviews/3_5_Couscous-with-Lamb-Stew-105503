I love this recipe, and combine it with another to make a completely tasty dish. Before browning the lamb I toss it to coat in a mix of cinnamon, black pepper, salt and allspice. Also add some minced ginger and garlic to the mix. Fabulous!

I first made this recipe years ago from my printed magazine. Then I lost it. After having recently rediscovering it here it's just as fantastic. I halved the recipe and still had dinner for my family for two nights. I find the heat of the dish addictive. Loved the stew years ago and still loving it now!

After eating couscous made by hand and by my french-algerian mother in law for years, I'd say this is a good recipe- very flavorful, a tad bit spicy, and not in need of all these modifications. I DID add ras el hanout- just to provide more authentic flair. My french algerian husband gives 2 thumbs up.

This recipe was delicious and worked well for my office dinner party! I used chicken broth instead of the tomato juice, but I also added about 1/4 cup of tomato paste and the consistency of the broth was perfect. I had 8 people for dinner and still had left overs for three nights. This recipe could be halved.

Decent, but it didn't make our socks roll up and down. Not as much flavor as we hoped. Didn't make the tomato sauce since its reviews here were iffy. Maybe that's what it needed? Probably won't make it again, in any case.

I liked this recipe but thought the flavors were a little simple. Next time around I'm planning on replacing half the tomato juice with lamb stock and adding garlic, cinnamon, and turmeric.

This was really good. Perhaps a three and a half fork. Served is for a dinner party and everyone loved it including my 10 month old. The only alteration was I used boneless leg of lamb instead of shoulder and did not have the rose petals. It was heavy on the veggies but I thought this was a good thing. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great way to get a healthy meal into my two year old! I made it much less spicy and made some other adjustments to make it more kid friendly. Instead of the recommended spices, I used the bay leaf, herbs de provence, cinnamon and some ras el hanout. I omitted the red pepper. Also, I added some honey and raisins to sweeten it a bit. Had to add more water to make it more saucy for the couscous. It does make a lot, but it freezes quite well. This rivals the couscous at our favorite restaurant in Paris!

This recipe would feed an army. Do not try to cook this dish in a pot smaller than 3 gallons.

This dish takes the better part of an afternoon to make, but is worth the effort. My guests were impressed and it was quite nice. I would increase the amount of lamb in the recipe because it gets lost with all of the other ingredients.

Overall, good, but I thought couscous was a disease suffered by goats. I was right.

I followed everything but added cabbage and leeks. I also added saffron to the couscous it really brightens up the dish. Everyone loved it and believe me it is hard to impress the french dinner party.

This is a good recipe but lacks any complexity. I like it but wouldn't make it again.

Skip the couscous and tomato sauce, this stew is great by itself in a big bowl. Also, this year I'm substituting potatoes for turnips as I wasn't that fond of them.

I cannot truly rate this recipe, but it looks pretty authentic. I spent two years in morocco where the ladies made the couscous by hand and THEN the recipe. I am going to use the traditional moroccan method for preparing the dish (no instant couscous) and use clarified butter in the couscous. I will use this basic recipe with longer cooking...must think about the amount of tomatoes...I will serve it in a mound like a volcano and pour the couscous in the top and let it seep through. Its possible that I will be the only one in my family to appreciate it..I will make the harissa sauce with walnuts, olive oil and dried hot peppers ground together.

This was surprisingly delicious considering I don't care for most of the vegetables, but they turned out really tasty. I made the couscous with broth from the stew instead of water, which made it even better. WARNING: This recipe produces a large amount of food (serves about 12)!

This is a pretty good recipe for couscous although the herbs spices are not what I prefer (cumin and a touch of cinnamon with lamb, along with (more) saffron). I also replaced the tomato juice with chicken broth, I thought eight tomatoes would provide plenty of tomato taste. The special sauce looks like a sort of homemade harissa (a North African hot pepper and tomato sauce), though not the best; if you prefer the broth, you're still in luck, because the best way to serve the sauce is thinned with a bit of hot broth, on the side, and drizzled over your plate to get the level of heat you like.

For meat-and-potato lovers, this is a dish with big bold delicious flavors. It was a big hit with my more traditionally-oriented parents! The broth served on the side was much better than the special spicy sauce.
