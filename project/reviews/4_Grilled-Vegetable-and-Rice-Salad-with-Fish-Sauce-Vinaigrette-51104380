Absolutely delicious! I used chipotle chilies in adobe sauce, since i did not have the chilies mentioned in the recipe. My family licked their lips wanting more.

What a truly wonderful combination of flavors and textures, so delicious! plus healthy. and easy. Here's an idea: when grilling isn't an option (wintertime!), dry-saute the veggies fast and hot in a wok or cast iron--or put them under the broiler. Also, why the toasted coconut is "optional" I don't understand: that, along with the mint, MAKES this dish. Makes it SUBLIME. You will want to gobble it up, inhale it, it's that good. And while I agree with the no-rice suggestion--because this stuff is so incredibly delicious "full-strength--for stretching leftovers (if any), YES to the rice. But maybe brown rice. Or quinoa! Just make it. A lot of it. And take some to a potluck soon before the fresh veggies of summer are gone. soooo goood!

This was a great dish and made a lot. It was even better the next day. I didn't use the sugar in the dressing and did not miss it.

In the word of my friend Mike, yummo! I skipped the rice and it was delicious. I didn't use 2 full cups of herbs, maybe 1.5. We served it with Steak Skewers with scallion dipping sauce featured in the same issue. Yummy meal.

Nice light dinner. Used brown basmati rice and tons of veggies, but no okra. I topped it with grilled tuscan kale and sesame seeds (no coconut). Kept dressing on side. Everyone loved it!

Delicious, I only used one pepper in the dressing because we are wimpy about heat. I also toasted frozen corn in a cast iron skillet as fresh corn is not yet in season. I will make this again.
