Fantastic. I made this for a "decadence" themed bridal shower and everyone loved it. Easy with most of the prep done ahead. Also good with white asparagus and I've even eaten the sauce over grilled salmon.

The sauce is ridiculously good. Definitely double it. Use medium-sized garlic cloves or it's slightly too strong. The plate also comes out looking intensely green. Consider using white asparagus. Finally, I started to peel the gus but too much flesh was being lost, so I just left them as is, and it was great! Two per person with a fruit salad (cantaloupe mint salad -- http://tinyurl.com/47aawd -- is a good accompaniment if you're trying to use all your mint) makes for a light, delicious summer meal.

I was skeptical of this recipe, especially after blending the mint dressing and smelling it. I was happily surprised. It was wonderful. Everyone loved it and asked if I would make it again for the next time we get together for dinner. I agree with other reviewers to double the dressing recipe.

This is really great tasting, with one exception: it's fairly salty, probably from the combination of salted water for blanching the asparagus and salty prosciutto. Next time I'll omit the salt. I also only blanched the asparagus for 4 minutes, my standard. Make a double batch of the dressing, it's really tasty, plus it'll blend much easier that way.

I made an appetizer version of this last year for Easter, it got rave reviews. I cut spears into smaller pieces, and smeared with marinated goat cheese before wrapping with proscuitto and drizzling with dressing. I will definitely be making again!

Very tasty sauce. I will definitely make it again!

Definitely a keeper. I'm glad I prepared the asparagus in batches because I found that 5 minutes overcooked them. The rest I blanched -basically 1 minute and ice water for a good crunch. They were easy to prepare ahead and refrigerate until serving time. Would've been 3 forks, but the mint sauce punts it to a 4. To die for.

I prepared this dish as part of an appetizer for a dinner party and it was a success. It has a great mix of color and texture and it is simple to create. My dinner guests thought it was innovative and refreshing. It's a definite winner.

My sister just served this with the Chicken red onion & mint skewers. Wow! Absolutely perfect. Can't wait to make this myself. The presentation, the flavour... Wouldn't change a thing. She served it on a bed of cantelope. Easy and impressive. Definitely a keeper. Especially in the Summer months.

The sauce was the star of this recipe, I drizzeled it over mellon and proscuitto and it was FAB. Will make it agin

I doubled up on the prosciutto, the dressing lacked a little. I added an egg yolk to give it a little extra substance.

This earns a 4 fork rating with a couple modificatations. We cooked our asparagus 2-3 minutes in lighly salted water with lemon slices left over from the sauce. It should just turn bright green. It was cooled as instructed, then each spear was wrapped in 1/2 slice of prosciutto. -Pretty darn good this way-

This is a good looking dish that didn't deliver on flavor. Too "asparagussy." A skinny slice of proscuitto and a drizzle of mint dressing just reminded me and my husband of what was missing. Namely, more prosciutto and more mint dressing. The dressing is utterly delicious. I'll definitely use it as a sauce or dressing for cold, light salads, fish and poultry dishes.
