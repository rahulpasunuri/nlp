I decided to make these and another linzer cookie recipe for Valentine's Day. These were great. Now, that isn't to say they were easy, and I didn't exactly follow the directions. I don't have the molds that were required, so I pressed the dough into a heart shaped cookie cutter and removed that while baking. So, it was a bit messy. For filling, I made chocolate ganache. I would definitely recommend these as a fabulous alternative to the regular linzer cookie.
