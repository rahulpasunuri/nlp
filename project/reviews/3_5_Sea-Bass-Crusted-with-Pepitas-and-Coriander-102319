I followed this recipe exactly, but used a different fish-flounder. It was excellent. I lessened the cooking time because the fillets were thin.

This was fantastic! We didn't have coriander seeds so used ground coriander and used Panko rather than bread crumbs. Our fish was especially fresh and the coating came out crispy and perfect!

This is fabulous! The crust is so easy and so delicious; it is tasty, compliments the sea bass without overpowering. This does not need to be more spicy -- sea bass has a delicate, nutty flavor of its own, and the pepita crust is perfect with it. I used Panko from store to make it even easier, also used jarred ground coriander. My pepitas (available at Trader Joes) were salted, so I omitted the tsp. salt. The bass was moist and flavorful, and the crust actually stuck to the fish and browned beautifully and was delish. Try this -- you won't be disappointed if you follow the recipe. Simple can be good.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. Our expectations were high because it smelled and looked delicious, but found it tasteless in the end.

I have made this twice(without breadcrumbs). It's pretty good. Yesterday I ran low on pepitas before I ran out of fish, so i added sesame seeds. I've seem them used with pepitas at a mexican restaurant... anyways the blend was pretty good too, maybe even better than the original.

The combination of toasted coriander seeds and the pepitas is wonderful. Next time I might reduce the amount of bread crumbs so you get even more of the flavor from the seeds. The sea bass was so moist and tender because of the quick searing. Not only was this recipe great it was easy and fast.
