Brought this dessert to a potluck with rave reviews. I tried to make this a more healthy cake (as difficult as that is to do with a mud cake) and it worked quite well. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 8 tbsp butter and 8 tbsp of apple sauce, 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. I also took another reveiwers suggestion and glazed the cake while it was still warm. Delicious! I will definitely make this again!

My son made this cake again. This time, the glaze was put on while the cake was still hot, after poking holes in the cake. Better. It is also better cold than warm. What happened to the 1/2 forks? Last time I gave it 3 1/2.

I liked this cake, but it wasn't wet enough, too brownie-like. Next time I would not cool the cake in the pan, I would poke it with toothpicks and glaze it while still hot. I wanted some of the glaze to soak into the cake more. Good flavor.

If you love chocolate, this is the one to make. It's our favorite cake. Can't get enough.

I have made this recipe several times, as written, to rave reviews. I always take it to work to share or else I'll eat the whole thing by myself...and it's a big cake!

the glaze soaks into the cake better if you poke it with a fork a few times and thin the glaze slightly.

I didn't use the nuts, but I added extra chocolate chips (can never get enough chocolate!!) and I made no glaze. Instead I made chocolate peppermint sauce (melted dark chocolate, cream and peppermint essence), served the cake hot with sauce and ice-cream ... delicious!! Much improved by being served warm.

I received many compliments for this cake; however it was too messy to serve and it wasn't the taste I wanted. You really have to like semi-sweet chocolate chips if you are going to enjoy this cake. I think I will just stick with my Nana's Texas Sheet cake recipe - it is almost the same, but it has cinnamon in the batter and an icing that's more the consistency of fudge. It's very easy to slice and serve and I get just as many compliments. :)

This cake is wonderful...a slam-dunk!! Everyone loved it, not a crumb left! So easy to make too!! I did take the suggestions to chop the pecans coursly and drizzled the glazed randomly (the glaze is really thick)and the effect was fantastic.

Wonderful cake and so easy! I cut the cake in half and sandwiched it with coffee icing, and also added instant coffee powder and liqueur to the glaze to make a mocha flavor. I thought it complemented the cake really well and gave you a different flavor. I would definately recommend this cake to anyone!

I also used a smaller pan .. 13 x 9 and had to bake it a bit longer. It still turned out well. This cake is a easy as pie to make .. about 1 hour start to finish. Rave reviews from the consumers !!

This is a wonderful recipe if you love chocolate, which we do. My husband continuously asks me to make this cake and it does keep well.

My review is mixed. My colleagues loved it, but for me it is just okay. I love chocolate cakes and I love desserts. However,this cake is a tad too rich and too sweet. The glaze is way too thick for me. I agree that the cake kept beautifully, in my case, for a week!!

I served this at a barbeque to rave reviews. It was deliciously moist. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was heaven! Only one problem - I couldn't keep my hands off of the leftovers which kept beautifully for days.

The cake was delicious. I used a smaller pan, 14"x10" and filled it a bit more than if I had used the pan called for in the recipe. I baked the cake for about 40-45 minutes and it was still very moist. Next time I will use very coarsely chopped pecans instead of halves for a more even distribution of nuts.

Just checked my July issue, it's 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.
