Good doughnuts, but I found that it was easier and just as tasty to drop the dough into the oil by spoonfuls. 4 minutes of fry time seemed to do the trick for 1" diameter balls (which expand at least twice the size).

Delicious! I used milk instead of the cream and it was absolutely fine! I also stuck some roasted and finely chopped pecans on top of the glaze (just because I had them lying around so figured why not)! I only fried up half the recipe the first day and they were SCRUMMY...followed up the next day with the rest of the dough...not quite as good...but not that surprising I guess!

Made these years ago and people still talk about them. The dough was pretty sticky so after the three hour chill I decided to drop the dough in by the spoonful. They turned out great and the process was so much quicker.

Amazing doughnuts! I traditionally make cake doughnuts every fall around Halloween, and ever since I found this recipe these are the doughnuts that I make now. You can tell when you start to roll out the batter that these will be a very tender doughnut. Don't overwork the dough, as I think then you will run into a sticky mess. Hint: take a cheese cloth or one of those old-fashioned dish drying towels, and stretch out & cover your cutting board, then dust it with flour and proceed to roll out your doughnuts. They fry up beautifully and taste scrumptious. The spice and pumpkin flavor is just enough without being so bold. I have to say I've never made the icing recipe here, I just dust in granular sugar... yum!

I made these this morning for our 12- year anniversary. Very easy to put together (I didn't read ahead and skipped the 3-hour chill, since I was in a hurry: I used a little extra flour to pat out the dough). I made a half-recipe with one whole egg, no extra yolks, and added just a little extra ginger. It made exactly 12 doughnuts and 12 doughnut holes, with no leftover dough. The last time I made doughnuts (Ginger Doughnuts from Gourmet), some were overcooked, so I was more careful with the oil temperature this time. These doughnuts turned out GREAT - subtle pumpkin flavor and nicely spiced. The texture was perfect: cakey without being heavy. And they weren't greasy at all. We skipped the glaze and used the spiced sugar for everything - loved the nutmeg/cinnamon combination. A definite winner at our house!!!

I made the dough last night and fried them this morning. It was a little tricky keeping the dough from sticking after it had been rolled out, so I used a ton of flour in that process. The recipe was easy to put together. In fact, I put the ingredients into the bowl in the wrong order (added dry ingredients first, then realized I should have started with the moist ingredients), and it didn't seem to make a difference. This was my first time deep-frying anything, and I found that it didn't make too much of a difference having the temperature exactly right; the doughnuts seemed to turn out okay. My friends loved them!

Very good! Be certain that you get your oil very hot, otherwise your holes or doughnuts will absorb & will be greasy. Very good w/o glaze & just a dusting of cinnamon & powdered sugar. Yields well over the amount quoted, but depends on how big you made your doughnuts to begin with. Definitely, not as good through the course of the day. Serve immediately.

I make doughnuts every year for our pumpkin carving party. These doughnuts were outstanding. It is amazing that people think you can get fresh doughnuts only at a big chain doughnut shop. I got rave reviews on these especially the cinnamon sugar ones. I made a second batch the next morning and distributed them to all my neighbors for breakfast. YUUUMMM!

These were amazing! They were incredibly easy to make, even using a glass and a upside down piping tip as the hole cutter. They fried up beautifully puffy and golden, and the taste was amazing. I covered half in the glaze and used the sugar coating for the donut holes on the other half of the donuts. Both ways were delicious. I served them for company and they were an absolute hit. Will definitely make them again!

Fabulous recipe, especially for the fall season! I initially worried over the details, such as size and shape, although I had only a glass and my finger to shape them, but each doughnut came out beautifully. I made the regular icing, which I enjoyed, but I think I will try a cream cheese icing the next time. Fall or Halloween sprinkles would also be a nice addition for the kids. A side note: I spent a good portion of my night chugging out batches of doughnuts. The amount of gas I used to keep my oil between 365º and 376º seemed very anti-green. Therefore making the recipe only a few times each years is recommended, which in my opinion is a good thing. If I could make delicious doughnuts in say ½ hour I would grow horizontally ;)

These were good, but nothing special for a doughnut. My dough was really sticky to work with. The pumpkin flavor was very subtle.

these were amazing--the hit of my dinner party. i didn't bother with the doughnout cutter; i just scooped out balls of the batter with an ice cream scoop and fried those (so they were more like beignets than doughnuts, i guess). i also skipped the glaze and just mixed powdered sugar with cardamom and cinnamon and sprinkled that over. I served them with the bitter caramel ice cream (also on this site) and candied orange peel. it was nearly a month ago and people are still talking about them!

These doughnuts were delicious, as the rest of my family thought so, too. I would definitely make these for any brunch or breakfast.

I just made this recipe. Not only was it my first attempt at donuts, but it was my first attempt at deep frying as well. Very straight forward recipe - results were great. Served them at a party with about 20 adults and 10 kids (4-6 year olds) and they were loved by all. Dealing with deep frying was a tad tricky- I'll need to read more about setting the right temperature. I borrowed a candy thermometer from a friend, clipped it to the pot and I was set - but first I heated the oil way to high. I then turned off the heat to lower the temperature and waited for the oil to get into the right range. I couldn't keep it at the right temp for long so then I'd raise the heat again. Anyway, by watching the temp on the thermometer and the color of the cooking dough I avoided mishaps. I will definitely do this recipe again.

About the best donuts I ever made. If you are using a hand held donut dough dispenser, don't refrigerate the dough, keep it soft.

Krispy Creme has nothing on these! Imagine preferring those greasy, flavorless things to these warm, fragrant doughnuts that are easy and much healthier (canola oil)!

This dough was very sticky, and I was concerned about over-flouring them, so mine ended up as free-form fritters (which also meant they had to be smallish to avoid raw centers and burnt exteriors). The flavor was terrific, the house smelled great, and my kids -- who are picky -- loved them. They're worth the effort, especially if you do the dry ingredients the night before. There was some leftover dough which I fried the next morning with decent results, but I wouldn't suggest doing the entire recipe the night before. I'll make these again, but next time will use more flour and try (again!) rolling them out, etc.

I'd never made doughnuts before. I'd never even seen anyone make doughnuts before. I'd never deep-fried before. I agree that the oil temperature was too high, but other than that, they were terrific!

SOME of us don't live in the land of Krispy Kremes and the president formerly known as "born again yesterday". We have to make our own doughnuts and are grateful for creative recipes such as this one.

What a treat these were! Homemade doughnuts are not more trouble than roll out cookies--easier really since you just pat the dough out. I used my meat thermometer and it worked just fine, but if I was going to make these many more times, a proper thermometer would be helpful. Just remember, these babies cook fast so don't turn your back on your pan of oil. Worth every minute and calorie.

I made these for my daddy and mom when they came to visit - made the dough the night before which made the process go very quickly in the morning. Worth the effort that's for sure!

if you want mass produced doughnuts, go buy your Krispy Kremes & quit judging those of us who want to try making something from scratch. these were a special request by hubby-reminded him of apple picking in New England & received 2 thumbs up. I made the dough the day before & that seemed to work fine. no problems with the temperature of the oil, but did have to send hubby & 2 year old out of the house while they cooked- I found my first deep frying experience to be stressful!

These are incredibly moist! I had to heavily flour my doughnut cutter, and fry them at a much lower temperature than the recipe suggested; the first few stayed raw in the middle while the outside burnt (could it be the chilled dough?). My husband proclaimed them to be "professionally delicious". A great Halloween treat, with little pumpkin candy sprinkles.
