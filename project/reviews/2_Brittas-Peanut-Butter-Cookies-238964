This Recipe was good. I used a melon ball cutter to scoop out the dough, and the i placed a maraschino cherry on top.

This is the best peanut butter cookie ever! Each time I make it, it gets RAVE reviews from everyone!

Hi, I think there isa serious mistake in the baking time. When I made these cookies I never cooked them that long! Maybe 12 minutes in a good oven. Also since the recipe appeared in the magazine I made some changes...more salt, more peanut butter, maybe slightly less flour. This is the first time I actually googled my own recipe and I was rather sad with the reviews but I think if they are made with a little cook's intuition and NOT over baked they can be amazing. Happy baking! --Britta

Bland, tasteless, hard cookies. What a huge disappointment- ended up throwing a bunch of old stale ones away today (and it is not an internet misprint; I used the recipe from the magazine).

I took readers' advice and cut the baking time, but the cookies still came out dry and with a not-so-satisfying texture.

These cookies are awesome. I used a 2-inch ice cream scoop to form the cookies and rolled the dough in sugar before baking. I baked the cookies for 14 minutes rotating the pan after 7 minutes.

I had been saving this recipe for the perfect occasion, and I made them this morning. The first pan turned out horribly dry and tasteless. Wanting to figure out what had gone wrong, I came on to read the reviews. Apparently, I wasn't the only one! Not wanting to throw out the rest of the dough, I took the previous user's advice and baked them for fifteen minutes. What came out was a completely different cookie. Very soft and smooth. I used natural peanut butter because I prefer the taste. My husband, who as a general rule does not like cookies, loves them.

The recipe error is in the time. 30 minutes??? 15-18 was fine for me. Oh, and I used the trans fat loaded Skippy. Makes some good cookies, but the LA Times ran a recipe a few years ago that has this one beat by a mile.

A cook from Cincinnati. I thought the recipe made too many. Just adding some chopped salted peanuts does the trick for these cookies. The salt topping made these cookies.

Probably should not have used natural peanut butter, but I salvaged the cookies by adding chocolate chips and turning them into ice cream sandwiches. Butter is too expensive to waste.

I had high hopes for these cookies. I have been searching for a recipie that uses natural peanut butter. Alas, these made a TON of barely edible cookies. They were very crisp/hard, my kids didn't even want them.

This recipe is extremely bland. Maybe the recipe has a misprint, because it seems to be a hit with Paul Grimes. I trust the folks at Gourmet;therefore, there must be a mistake with the ingredients.

I found that flavor was not the issue as much as texture was -- these were WAY too dry. Not a pleasantly crisp and crunchy dry. A deplete your mouth of all moisture dry. And I used extra processed, extra homogenized peanut butter. My cookies are headed for the food processor to be smushed into crumbs suitable for crust, etc.

Using the recipe as is, I have to agree that they were decent but a little bland. The second batch I sprinkled kosher salt on top (like you would sugar on a muffin, say) and they were delicious!

No real flavor. Very disappointing!
