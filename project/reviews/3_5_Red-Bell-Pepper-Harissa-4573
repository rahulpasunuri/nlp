I have made this several times over the years with the garbanzo bean and potato fritters. I always blend the sauce altogether in the food processor to make a smooth sauce. It is delicious and a winner for everyone that has tried it.

I have made this recipe several times now. Every time I have to make a double batch of the harissa because people eat it as a side dish!

This recipe is a dream: versatile, tasty, simple. Once you get the roasted peppers out of the way, the rest is so easy. I've made it exactly as written, and enjoyed it very much. I've also made it in the food processor, and without the jalapenos, substituting a large clove of garlic instead; also, I sometimes add a small spoonful of sugar to round out the vinegar. It's delicious any way you make it. Finally, I don't serve these with latkes (although I'm sure that would be v. good)--instead, I use it as an all-purpose sauce/dip for asparagus, roasted veg, or as part of an appetizer buffet.

We had 12 people for dinner, not one person liked it. The only comment was, "this might go with huevos ranchos but not with latkes." We were very disappointed.

Wonderful - my guests loved it! It is not as hot as I expected, which is fine by me. I added some garlic, which I thought makes it even better.

I made this to go w/Latkes for a dinner party and everyone raved about the Harissa. I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was extremely easy to make.

Excelent recipe. I added some cream to make it a little easier to serve. Just delicious with the potato pancakes
