I loved this cake. I had extra batter, so I made 2 nine-inch cake rounds, some extra icing, and had a nice layer cake. I added a little rum to the icing and it was really tasty, lots of spice and very moist. Will definitely make it again!

This was fair. Lost my favorite zucchini cake recipe and was searching for a replacement, but this in not even close. Doubt that I would make it again. Same with the icing...good, but have one I like better.

Delicious! I make this cake for some co-workers. Most of them were reluctant to try it because it was make with zucchini. After a little convincing they tried it and loved it! They all raved about how great the cake tasted, especially the frosting. I added a tablespoon of coconut rum to the frosting, which tamed the cinnamon flavor just a bit and garnished with some coarsely chopped pecans. Superb!

Took these to a party in the form of cupcakes, and they went over very well. I liked them because they weren't overly sweet. Also traded out the olive oil for canola and toasted the pecans. Garnished with a candied pecan.

Made it yesterday...it was light and flavourful. My Italian husband could'nt believe it there were zucchinis in it. Made a few changes: toasted the pecans, used corn oil (living in Tuscany only have extra virgin olive oil), and used cake flour. I didn't drain the zucchini and look forward to use the "big" ones that I often end up with in my garden.

This was a good, but not great, recipe. I have several other zucchini cake recipes that I like better. That being said, the frosting is great!

Absolutely nothing special about this cake. Made exactly as written, even went out and bought the olive oil, but was not at all impressed. There are much better zucchini cake/bread recipes out there. Gave it away to a neighbor who is not picky.

I made this recipe with a couple of changes and it was phenomenal! First, I made them into cupcakes for a birthday celebration. I used walnuts, toasted, and canola oil instead of the olive oil. SOOOO good!

This was fantastic, not too sweet, great texture, dense but not heavy, loved the pecans in the cake. It was super easy to put together. I did use extra virgin olive oil as it was the only olive oil I had, seemed to work/taste just fine. I will make this many times! The frosting was delicious. I had a few extra pecans so I sprinkled them on top of the frosting and it looked perfect!

Very tasty--a lot like carrot cake. Made it for a family get-together and it got devoured quickly!

Good basic cake - much like a zucchini bread baked in a cake pan. Easy to put together. Cinnamon adds a nice tint to frosting. I used canola oil because it is less expensive and didn't think the olive oil would taste much different.

What a moist and flavourful cake! As I have a glut of courgettes, I'm going to bake a couple more and then freeze them for another time without the icing.

I wasn't crazy about it. It was a good cake if you are looking for something that is not too sweet. The frosting was delicious. I will definitely us it on other cakes, (carrot, spice, etc.). I had a problem smoothing out the brown sugar. I ended up having to put the sugar, oil and eggs in an electric mixer to thoroughly blend it. Maybe this resulted in a different texture than others experienced.

Disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly. The cake was dry, coarse, and not at all flavorful. I took it out at the earliest number of minutes and my oven is accurate. I have been baking cakes for more than 40 years and this is the first one I have had to throw away. No one in the family would eat it. The frosting was pretty good, but the cake itself- yuck.

I didn't squeeze the zucchini, and the cake was fine - not too moist. I figured if BA wanted us to squeeze the zucchini, they would have said so.

Is it necessary to squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini before adding it to the cake batter? Thanks

P.S. Forgot to say in my review that I used canola oil because all my olive oil was extra virgin. Worked just fine.

My sweetie and I really liked this! It's dense & moist - like a carrot cake. I used one of those zucchini on steroids that you find in your garden in August - what a good recipe for those oversized ones! I cut down the sugar to a scant lightly packed cup of brown sugar for the cake, and 1/2 cup for the frosting. Perfect for us!

Yummo!! Loved this cake as did the kids - hubby loves everything I make! I threw in 2 mushy bananas and used about 1 cup of shredded yellow zucchini. It was super moist and tasty and the cinnamon in the icing made it. I scaled back the qty on the icing by about a 1/3. I find that BA recipes make way too much icing.

Followed recipe directions exactly. With the warm spice base, this may be a better fall recipe. Good alternative to carrot cake.

Okay, fabulous cake and great reviews from everyone who ate it. Two things I did differently: toasted the pecans before adding them to the batter, and used canola oil as I only had EVOO in the house. Enjoy!

This cake turned out wonderfully! I baked it for exactly 45 min and made sure to leave it cool in the pan for a little over an hour, I also added a little honey to the batter for extra flavor. The frosting is great and has a nice color and more depth than a regular cream cheese frosting thanks to the cinnamon in it. Will definitely make again!

If I were rating only the cake, I would give the recipe 1 fork; the flavour was good but the texture was dense and oily. The frosting, however, was delicious....not too sweet with the cinnamon adding a nice twist.
