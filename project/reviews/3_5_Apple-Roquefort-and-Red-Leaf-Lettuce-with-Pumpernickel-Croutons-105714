This was tasty. The elements all made a great salad. The dressing needed a little sweetening. It was good, but it wasn't fabulous. I'll make it again though.

Just delicious! We have also used the Blue Cheese and Chive Dressing from the October 2003 issue of Gourmet instead of this dressing - delicious as well!

This is my favorite salad, perfect for autumn. The only change I make is that sometimes instead of using pumpernickel for the croutons, I use whole wheat bread and then sprinkle with cinnamon.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone (even the kids:) loved it! The dressing neeeded more flavor as it was too vinegary so we added some honey which blended so well with the ingredients....BIG HIT that I would make again.....we made the bacon and croutons earlier that day so it was an easy recipe to put together at the last minute. Simply fabulous! Everyone asked me for the recipe...

I have given this 2.5 forks if I could. We liked it very much, and I made it two nights in a row since I had all the ingredients on hand. I didn't use the bacon (although I'm sure it would have been delicious). I agree that the dressing was subtle, but there is a lot going on in this salad, so the dressing is not a distraction.

I'd give this 2.5 forks if I could. We liked this very much, and I even made it two nights in a row since I had enough ingredients on hand. I didn't use the bacon (I'm sure it would have been delicious, though). I agree that the dressing is subtle, but it works with so many other flavors going on in this salad.

Okay, what did I miss? I've made many delicious salads from this site before, but would never include this salad in that category. Thought the dressing was very bland and, based on the measurements, only afforded a meager dribble for each salad. I would not waste time on this again.

I have made this salad many times and it is excellent. I like it with Pumpernickel Croutons made from "appetizer-style" bread.

have made this salad twice to rave reviews. i added toasted pecans and made the dressing with basalmic vinegar since i didn't have sherry. i actually had several guests say it was the best salad they ever had

This was pretty good, but I question the others who had review such as "the best salad they ever had" I certainly wouldn't go that far. Quite frankly I don't think the pumpernickel croutons did anything for the rest of the flavors. It sounded like a good idea and the color was good but it really didn't work. I've had better salads though I won't cross this off the list. Perhaps I will just skip the croutons (my husband just pushed them aside in his plate).

Great compliment of flavors. My guests wanted the recipe. Didn't make it with recipe dressing since I didn't have sherry vinegar so dressed it with olive oil and rice vinegar. Will make it again. Followed advice from other comments and used very little bacon grease for croutons.

This was a Thanksgiving hit!! Everyone raved about it and it was not only delicious, but a perfect compliment to other traditional Thanksgiving fare.

Very yummy -- everyone raved. Make sure you measure the cups of lettuce -- I used two whole heads, and it was way too much, hence sparsely dressed. The bacon took much longer than 5 minutes to get crispy. I also drained much of the bacon fat before cooking the croutons, and they didn't really get crisp, so I broiled them, but they were still a little soft.

Out of this world! I made this for my Dad, who loves blue cheese, for a belated Thanksgiving dinner. I will make again this Christmas! yum

My guests (who are good friends and are always honest about my cooking) told me that it was the BEST salad they EVER had. I used a Barlett pear instead of the apple; also, I didn't have sherry vinegar on hand, so just used red wine vinegar and added a touch of honey. Be certain to chill your salad bowls beforehand, don't over-dress the greens, and you, too, will be en route to salad heaven. This is a keeper!

Delicious and very satisfying. It's a great fall salad -- just makes you want to go rake leaves!

Make this salad with the dressing from HEARTS OF ROMAINE SALAD WITH APPLE, RED ONION, AND CIDER VINAIGRETTE http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105784 and you will be very pleased!

This salad is excellent. Hands down, it is the most requested salad I serve. The flavors mix so well together, memories are created every single time! Try it as it is written, and you cannot fail to please the most discriminating palate!

I made this as an accompaniment to our dinner last night and both my husband and I really liked it. It is a little twist on the versions with toasted nuts. The bacon adds to the flavor as well. I made the croutons larger than 1/4" and didn't use all the bacon grease to fry the croutons. Not the healthiest part of the salad but, oh well!

Very nice. I didn't use the cranberries.I have made this twice and I thought the dressing was on the tart side, so the second time I made it I added a little honey to the dressing and I liked it much better. My husband preferred the original recipe's dressing.

Very nice, very pretty.

This is a wonderful and incredibly easy salad; I've had a similar salad at the Mermaid Cafe at Neiman Marcus in Dallas, TX. The pumpernickel croutons are outstanding, and add a depth of flavor I'd not expected. I've also substituted Bartlett pears for the apple, and it remains very tasty!
