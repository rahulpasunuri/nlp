Star anise at its best! I first was introduced to star anise when we lived for a year in Vancouver, Canada. I made this recipe mostly as written. I used small bite size 1" beets, I didn't process the beets to preserve them, I just put the jar in the refrigerator for a week, and I left the star anise in with the beets for two days. They were fantastic! Sweet,with a nice subtle tone of the anise when you bit into the beets. I added them to a salad, two per guest, and they got raves. Even the picky spouse and the 3 yr old liked them.
