I'm writing another review since this recipe is so good. I made it again and guests just loved it. I want to add to pound the chicken before slicing into pieces. Of course, use more (double or triple) sun-dried tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, a clove of minced sauteed garlic. Don't forget to deglaze the pan before adding cream. You will love this recipe!

This was absolutely delicious and our guests raved about it. Deglazing the pan with white wine before adding cream is an absolute must. I also added sauteed mushrooms and a minced clove of sauteed garlic to the sauce.

Sorry, I keep forgetting to add other hints. Like another reviewer said...deglaze the pan with the wine first before adding the cream. All those stuck on bits of chicken will release itself and makes for an incredible sauce.

I made this again last night for the third time and wanted to add a new note. Instead of using sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil, I found hydrated ready to use sun dried tomatoes not packed in any oil and frankly it was even better with lots of flavor. I also used penne pasta for the first time and found it a fabulous accompaninment, more than the fetucinni. Again, I HIGHLY recommend tripling the sauce recipe. I also topped with fresly grated parmesan. You won't be disappointed!

I read all the reviews and took the following suggestions. Tripled the recipe and served over a bed of fetucinni. Cubed the chicken for easy eating rather than left in strips. I added some garlic as well. Very simple and well loved by my family and boyfriend. I've made it twice and will make it again tonight.

This is one of my stand-by recipes. I sprinkle chicken with garlic powder and sautee with garlic. This is GREAT!

Rating: 3
3 forks as is, 4 with a few adjustments. First off, there is too much chicken and too little cream to be a good pasta sauce, but it is great over rice. Second, I prefer fresh tarragon to basil - it goes beautifully with the sundried tomatoes and the chicken. All in all, this is a great, quick recipe that tends to please crowds.

Rating: 3
My husband and I enjoy this quick and easy recipe. I've added a few things to a sauce each time: artichoke hearts or mushrooms, to give it a little variety because it is an extremely simple meal. Tastes great over white rice or orzo pasta

Rating: 3
This is good for what it is: a mid-week quick meal. With this amount of chicken however, and particularly if you're serving over a pasta like linguine, you absolutely have to double or triple the sauce. I also agree with the prior reviewer that there has to be a better way to do the chicken than this. If I were doing this again I might think about adding shiitake or porcini mushrooms with it - maybe using dried versions soaked in water and then drained, so that you don't have the liquid dissipation problem noted by others.

Rating: 3
I had the same problem others did with the consistency of the sauce and maybe for the same reason. I forgot to drain the tomatoes and the results were lumpy and then separated. Plus I sauteed and added mushrooms which added liquid. However, it tasted wonderful and next time I'll follow my own advice.

I'm a total foodie and this was so easy and so delicious. From prep to plate in 60 minutes! I loved it and my husband loved it.

This recipe is fantastic! I did not cut the chicken. I added about 1/2C of fresh mushrooms, a little garlic powder and to make it less creamy, I added about 1/4C of chicken broth and a little more wine; it was perfect. Very nice for company also.

The sauce was very very good. I just wish there were more. I think I'll have to double it next time. And I think I might just sear whole chicken breasts - that would probably be juicier. And I only had red wine on hand so I used some cooking wine - marsala I think - and it was still great. Definitely a recipe I'll repeat and play with.

Rating: 2
After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed in this dish. It was easy, the sauce was OK, and the ingredient list contained only items I mostly had on hand. However, I thought the chicken strips themselves were bland... had to keep dredging them in the sauce before each bite. It was good enough to finish our meal and even to keep the leftovers, but not to make again.

Add me to the list of fans. Really quick, easy (one pan) & tasty. Was super over basmati rice. I used dried sun-dried tomatoes & soaked them in the olive oil for a bit. Ran out of white wine, so I threw in white zinfandel, and used onion instead of scallion. Anyway -- delicious!

Oh My is this soooo delicious! This was pretty easy to make, I'm sure it gets easier the second time you make it. I absolutely loved the flavors of this dish! My husband is very picky and he loved it too. The only thing I did differently was I deglazed the pan with the wine after adding the shallots and then i added the cream, etc. I also may try to puree this once completed the next time i make it. I also would have to say this sauce would go great over ravioli, gnocchi or bowtie pasta as well. Its a keeper in my book. Thanks!

Wow, just wow. Even though I own about 12 cookbooks, i get about 98% of all my recipes from epicurious, and I don't usually post, but this recipe warrants it. This is amazing, and criminally easy. It has a great bistro flavor, and is so, so easy. I used dried basil and it turned out great. My sause reduced too much, (I had to cook the chicken longer) so I kept deglazing with white wine (by the way you MUST use good wine, I used a french wine similar to a Sauv. Blanc) and added some more cream at the end to increase the sauce. In the future I will double the sauce to have enough to pour over pasta, (I used fettucine, but I think penne will be great too, and I will cut the chicken into bite size pieces next time). But this is great, make this recipe tonight. Also, I think it would be great to entertain with.

Awesome, delicious, and simple! A great combination! I can't wait to make this again. One comment: don't cook this too long, or it won't be creamy, but more of a pesto consistency. That's alright and it still tastes amazing, but it doesn't do too well for the appearance aspect. Thank God for candles!

This is a wonderful reciepe and have made it for 15 people and got rave reviews. I would like to thank the creator of this fine dish. However, as any one that likes to play in the kitchen i have changed the dish only slightly. i increase both the dries tomatoes and the cream just a bit. I serve this dish with portabella mushrooms sauteed in butter, garlic and a splash of white wine. Also with roasted red and yellow bell pepper marinaded in olive oil, balsalmic vinegar and couple tablespoons of sugar to make them a sweet and sour taste. that and rolls and u have a meal for a king

An old stand-by in my house. This recipe is so simple, but unbelievably delicious - I'm not lying when I say I only wish resaurants would reliably serve something this tasty.

I made so many mistakes, but this recipe still turned out great. First, I forgot to flour the chicken (yikes!), which I don't recommend. Then, I added a little bit more whipped cream than called for and added way too much basil (on accident). But I let everything simmer down to a paste. This is because it never really became a sauce for me... just went from a lumpy watery mess with too much basil to a paste. But it was fantastic! I grabed some cooked noodles and mixed it all together for a wonderful meal that my husband and I both enjoyed (quite unexpectedly)!

I made this recipe years ago (when it first showed up in Bon Appetit)and have thought about it on many occasions. Finally, I got on epicurious to look it up and make it again. It was just as good (if not better) than what I remember it and will incorporate it into my regular recipe repertoire. The side dish of pasta tossed with oil, parmesan, salt and pepper made a great side dish with it.

Simple and delicious. I don't know if it was b/c was too much oil stuck to the s-d tomatoes, but the sauce kind of had a lumpy/coagulated consistency. Definitely needed more cream (I used the half & half on hand). Still, it was easy with room to play with to your liking.

Excellent with some minor adjustments - we like spicy comfort. Sauteed the chicken without addition of flour Added some crushed red pepper flakes with the shallots. Added a can of diced tomato in juice because we like the flavor and the additional sauce. Increased the cream and wine and basiljust a little (more sauce and to balance the acidity of the extra tomato). Then just needed to increase the reduction time. It was heavenly!

Simplicity is very important to me. And this recipe fits the bill. To top it off - delicious as well. I am fairly health conscience, so I changed the cream to evaporated milk. It was great! Perfect for ending a long day at work...that and a nice Gamay.

This is a great recipe with a few of my modifications......pound the chicken and coat with a pine nut mixture (process pine nuts in a food processor and add only a small amount of flour and salt and pepper) After the pine nut crust is a nice golden brown and chicken is cooked through, transfer to a platter and keep warm in oven. Saute 16oz pkg of mushrooms( white or baby bellas )sliced in half, add the cream, sundried tomatoes and fresh basil ( you must use fresh! - I omit the wine) Let simmer for a few minutes until all flavors combine and sauce thickens, pour over chicken and serve. I usually serve this with a green vegetable and roasted red skinned potatoes.

This recipe was FANTASTIC! I love it... Probably one of my top reciepes from this site... It was simple, it was tasty and it was fairly healthy (minus the cream)...

This is so good its become one of our rare family favorites. Ive made it several times and made a few conversions in the process. Ive substituted the wine with a fruity zinfandel, typically use SD tomatoes that have herbs already in the mix and I provide tomato-basil feta cheese to sprinkle on top. Makes for a great take-to-work lunch the next day as well, if there's any left.

It was absolutely delicious. It looked & tasted just like what you would get in a nice Italian restaurant. My husband was very impressed. And it didn't take very long to make - my favorite kind of recipe. I did make a few of the changes other cooks suggested: I added 4 cloves of garlic with the shallots, and doubled the whipping cream & white wine for only 2 chicken breasts which was just enough sauce, couldn't imagine any less. And I served the chicken over spinich fettucini with crusty bread to soak up the yummy sauce. Maybe next time I will use a little less butter & oil, sauce was a little too oily. But I will definitely make this again & especially for guests - it was so pretty. This is the 2nd recipe I've made from this website & had great results - my husband said I was on a roll.

I enjoyed this dish, but found it to be too oily. I will eliminate the butter next time. I agree that it could benefit from a clove of garlic or so.

The sun dried tomato cream sauce for this recipe was delicious. My family loves my fried chicken breasts, so I seasoned and floured the chicken to fry it, and then made the sauce to serve over top. It was wonderful and a pretty easy way to dress up plain chicken.

Rating: 3
I admit to tinkering with the recipe as follows: after browning the chicken (and putting it in the oven to finish cooking), I sauteed 1/2 cup shallots with 2 teas minced garlic, until softened and just beginning to brown. I increased the wine to 12 oz and let it reduce. Then I added the cream (1 cup?) and let it reduce again with the sun dried tomatoes, and 2 TBL tomato paste (for color and taste). This made enough sauce to coat 8 oz of spinach fettucine and coat the chicken (add the juices that have accumulated). Use the oil from the tomatoes to saute the chicken in for additional flavor, and add grated parmesan at the end if you want the sauce thicker. All in all, it is quick and tasty for when you want something new to do with boneless chiken breasts.

For those of you that felt this recipe was lacking, there is another one - Chicken Breasts with Sun-Dried Tomato-Cream Sauce BA 12/99. The newer recipe includes garlic, more shallots and tomatoes. You can also add dry white wine if needed and basil if desired. We loved it.

TO DIE FOR!!! I agree with a previous reviewer -- ADD GARLIC!!! Adding garlic turned a 2 fork recipe into a 4 fork recipe. One note -- when sauteeing the shallots, the pan will be quite dry; I added some oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. Delish! My sister, who is a great cook, demanded the recipe.

This dish went quite well with some linguine. I also doubled the sauce portion of the recipe, which I would surely advise to anyone else making this; it would be too dry/thick otherwise. I added about 3 huge cloves of garlic, minced at the same time as I cooked the shallots, why not? :) Would definitely make again!

This was a great and easy recipe. I took everyone's advice and made some bowtie pasta and tossed with the sauce that I doubled. It was great. I would definitely make this again!

When I first made this recipe Ididn't have the shallots and did substitute them with garlic. I don't think I will ever make it any other way. This recipe is quick and delicious. I specifically came on-line to find it as I lost that issue of Bon Appitit. After lots of scrolling I found it. Yeah:)

This recipe is VERY easy to prepare with GREAT results. It doesn't take long to cook but tastes like you slaved. Next time I might try adding garlic (Emeril's not the only one who loves it !) I served it with fresh fetticine noodles and received lots of compliments.
