Appetizer for Thanksgiving. Was given rave revues. Not bland at all but had added extra green onion and made filling day before so flavors blended.

I have to agree with the cook from Lithuania. My guests liked this a lot more than I did - I thought the filling was very bland. The best part about it was the do-ahead factor which makes it great for entertaining, but I wouldn't use it as the primary hors d'oeuvres.

I agree that this dish is truly tasty, easy to make (and a great do-ahead), and that it goes very well with Champagne. I have to admit that my guests raved about it more than I did - the filling seemed blander than I expected. Maybe I'm just picky...

Of a dozen recipes I made for a Holiday open house, this was probably the biggest hit! Sounds odd, but it's not difficult, easy to do ahead, and very pretty to serve. Tastes like the most sophisticated deviled eggs imaginable! Superb with champagne.
