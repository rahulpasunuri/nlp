Didn't taste anything like the great escargot that I have had in restaurants. I either did something wrong, or the escargot were off.

Right on Recipe that can easily be modified to suit. I suggest adding a tablespoon or two of Absinthe. Or in place of that you can add a small pinch of nutmeg. Either adds a new dimension to the result. Lowering the oven temperature and extend cook time a little also works well.

Nobody should be intimidated by escargot. This recipe was very easy and it really impressed my boyfriend. I would recommend that anyone who loves French food give this recipe a try.

Undecided on do-over. The snails had a strange taste. Don't know if due to laurel/clove in canning process or just old. I should have just made garlic bread with the yummy butter mixture. I recommend reading all reviews since many offer good suggestions (like cooking in mini-muffin tins when shells not available).

So easy to make. Buy large snails in can, rinse, and simmer in white wine. Insert escargot in escargot dish and top with said butter with DOUBLE the recommended garlic in the butter. The SECRET INGREDIENT is definitely at least a tablespoon of PERNOD. It gives the escargot that "restaurant taste" that rarely is reproduced at home with residential cookware and stoves with low BTUs. Top with some Reggiano at the last minute before broil conclusion. Saves tons of money to make at home instead of buying in a restaurant. If butter is made in advance, you can have escargot faster than microwaving a "hot pocket". Serve this up for an appetizer at your next suare', and you'll be the talk of the neighborhood.

I would use salted butter, oh yes, or sea salt. Also mix in a tblsp or two of brandy or whiskey in the butter-mix. this will bring out the flavor of brandy or whiskey in a delicate way

I'd add a tablespoon of Pernod. Still delicious without it, though.

try throwing a few fresh or reconstituted morels into the ramekin with the snails. SPECTACULAR.

I intend to make this in the future, but am shocked that this is the only escargot recipe on this site.

I recommend doubling the garlic (at least) and using Salted Butter. Simmering in the white wine added a lot of flavor. Instead of using a muffin tin, shells or fancy escargot dishes, I used ramikins - 6 per dish - and topped them with a circle of puff pastry - the dough should extend over the dish otherwise it falls in and is a soggy mess. (Don't ask how I know this...) Very Good recipe!!!!

This is a good basic, easy preparation for escargot. I have always added some finely snipped chives as well as the parsley & shallot. Also, as others have suggested a little white wine in the bottom of the pan mixes nicely with the butter sauce that escapes from the shells, making a wonderful dipping sauce for crusty French bread. Awesome...a garlic lovers dream.

I did not make this recipe, but i did have them last night as a phenominal appetizer... for whoever makes these next, try adding a bit of grated almond, or almond powder (it is subtle, but a WONDERFUL addition) along with the other reviewers' suggestions.. and definitely have good french rolls for the extra butter sauce!

Champagne and escargot, what a pair. We had friends arriving in an hour with nothing planned and then we found a can of Escargot from last Christmas! It's so easy and revives the memories of restaurant Escargot of the past. Using a petite muffin tin works wonders as does a few extra cloves of garlic. I plan to double recipe for dinner party this month....serve out of a huge champagne glass.

Good recipe that can be adapted to use mushroom caps instead of shells. I use a muffin tin when I have more company than I have escargot dishes. Place as many large fresh mushroom caps into the muffin tray as possible. Fill caps with escargot and cover with sauce in recipe and top with mozzarella cheese. In dire need, 9" by 13" cake pan will also work.

I've made this recipe twice now, and it was wonderful! Last night I tried simmering the snails in wine and a little Pernod--very nice touch! I didn't have snail shells or an escargot plate, but I used a couple of scallop shells, dividing the snails evenly between them.

This was absolutely delicious!! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and simmered the snails in wine first, then added 1 tsp of Pernod to the butter. It was just wonderful. To those unlucky souls (like myself) who cannot find an escargot pan to save their lives, I used a mini-muffin pan. The shells fit perfectly and the pan did a great job catching all that yummy butter!! A definite keeper!!!!!!!!

I make just a few changes for super easy, elegant escargot. I smash the softened butter and herb by hand. Roll in waxed paper and refrigerate (can make ahead.) Then I boil the escargot a while in a can of consomme. I do not use shells. I put one snail in each hole of escargot dish. I place a slice of the shallot butter on top and broil just a few minutes. Serve with crusty baguettes - just like a fine restaurant and really easy and inexpensive.

Add 1 tsp. of Pernot and it is perfect!!!!!! I also like to simmer the snails in 6 tsp of white wine and onion until the snails have absorbed all the wine. Makes them perfectly tender before browning in oven.

Beautiful!!! How narrow minded some reviewers can be!! For those who like to add wine to the garlic butter, like I do, try a few drops of Pernod. A French Chef gave me the hint. Divine...

This is a classic-I like to add a touch of white wine. Make sure you have plenty of crusty french bread to sop up the butter. If you have never tried snails, you are missing something wonderful. Even my 13 & 15 yr. old sons love them. We had a party last weekend w/ several friends-6 dozen snails were devoured!!!!

This is a classic escargot dish as you will find in any French American restaurant. Very good.

What's wrong with all these reviewers? First of all, if you won't even eat snails, why even read the recipe, much less give it a review (as you obviously didn't make it!) Perhaps you should expand your palate. Secondly, there are no leeks in the recipe anywhere. Thirdly, to the reviewer who states this is elegant but nasty, could you provide some constructive info for those of us who actually would like to know whether to try this?

How do the leeks enter into the final product? You tell us how to sauté them, but not where or when to add them to the rest of the process. Very confusing.
