I had no problem making this. It was pretty basic. I have to say that the Rosemary flavor did not come through, even with fresh Rosemary. I would increase the amount next time. It did not curdle, I kept close watch over it. I did add some fresh peas I had cooked and had leftover so as not to waste them.

I thought this was very good and I disagree with other reviews that it was time consuming. I didn't have left over turkey but bought a rotisserie chicken. Used half and half instead of cream but did use both egg yolks. I did think the dumplings were a little off, but overall, it tasted great and was a snap to prepare.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this dish. He is not a big fan of chicken and dumplings and he groaned when I said I was going to use our leftover turkey for this but he loved it! I will definitely make this again, it is definitely a step up from my usual dumpling dish.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I usually love everything I find on this site but this was quite fussy to make for what it is and I could not get the sauce to thicken properly, I followed the recipe to a "T". I've had much better potpie with much less fuss. Sauce did not curdle or separate, just not as tick and creamy as I expected

Here are my comments: ....1. I don't consider this a pot pie. It's just turkey, gravy, & dumplings. ....2. Maybe we are big eaters in my family, but it seemed more like 4-6 servings, not 6-8 servings. ....3. I julienned the vegetables as directed, but next time I would cut them in small dice. ....4. The risk of making the dumplings as large as they state is that the sauce cooks down a good bit while you wait for the dumplings to cook. Unless you really like big dumplings, I would definitely make the dumplings smaller than stated. I would make 10 or 12 (not 6 or 8). ....5. The dumplings are really not necessary to the success of this recipe; it would be good without them too.

I've made this twice. It is excellent and very easy. I've never had any problem with the sauce curdling, using heavy cream as the recipe calls for. Rich and elegant taste. I love mushrooms and peas, but not sure I'd add anything to this, it is so good as written. The dumplings are a little tricky....unless you make them pretty small, it takes quite a bit longer than twenty minutes. But the sauce bubbled almost the whole time and it stayed smooth.

Very tasty, great way to use up leftover turkey. Did steam dumplings little longer, but they were just what dumplings should be like. Great recipe.

Excellent! After this Canadian Thanksgiving weekend I was all set to make this recipe. Having never seen or eaten a dumpling the reviews made me wary. I ended up adding a little extra milk (batter just seemed too dense otherwise) and simmered them for closer to 40 minutes - well worth it. Young kids and hubby loved it and went back for seconds.

The four forks is for my version. First, I "dumped" the dumplings. After reading of others' problems with getting fully cooked dumplings without curdling the turkey mixture, I chickened out (just a little poultry metaphor, folks!) and decided to cook up some egg noodles and use those as a base for the sauce. That turned out great and probably saved a lot of work and time. For the white wine, I used vermouth (a suggestion that came from "Cooks Illustrated" for those of us who don't drink a lot of white wine and end up with opened-for-cooking wine bottles mouldering at the back of the refrigerator). I subbed low fat sour cream for the heavy cream and only used one egg yolk. I took the advice of Judy from Cupertino in her review, and had some corn starch (about 1 tbsp.) dissolved in broth (about 1/4 cup) in case the lower fat ingredients didn't thicken the sauce enough. They didn't, so I added that and stirred til thickened before the turkey went in. I was also very careful to never let the sauce boil after adding the sour cream and egg. The result of all this was phenomenally delicious, with a really satisfying texture, flavor and mouth feel. Will be making this any time I have enough left over cooked poultry.

A very tasty dish, however, following the recipe exactly (keeping the sauce from boiling) produced dumplings that were not quite done, and that was disappointing. Using an old fashioned ice cream scoop worked well for placing the dumplings in the pan.

This was a fun adventure and the food was remarkable. I had roasted a turkey the day before (to make room in my freezer) and also made a tofu version for my housemate (substituting mushroom broth and tofu). Also, I added chantrelles and peas to the veggies. The dumplings came out nicely. I look forward to experimenting with this recipe in the future.

Wonderful dish for a cold, rainy winter's night - I, too added peas.

Wonderful comfort food. I substituted leeks for the onions, and agree that peas are a must for potpie- I will definitely make this again.

I liked this better than Thanksgiving dinner, and my family said it was the best leftover dish they'd ever had. Also, it was easy. I'd never made dumplings before, and was apprehensive, but it was simple, and came out great -- wonderful flavor and pleasing, comfort-food consistency and presentation. I served it in big soup bowls as a one-dish meal, and prepared it in an attractive Creuset pot which I served from at the table. The only tinkering I might try next time would be to add frozen peas, for color and texture.

My family loved it - the ultimate comfort food. My daughter said it's not pot pie without peas, so I threw in a few frozen ones before adding the dumplings, and they were great (I'm not a fan of cooked peas). The only things I might change in the future would be to make the sauce a little thicker and maybe a little bit more dumplings - although my husband thought it was perfect as it was. Oh - and maybe more rosemary too. I put in a little more than it called for and felt I could have put in even more. All in all, definitely a keeper!

I made this dish a few times and the sauce turned out ok everytime. After the first time following the recipe exactly, I now halve the sauce (from two yolks to one and reduce the heavy cream in half), that way, the sauce was still creamy and rich. The preparation is not time consuming if you got leftover turkey. I like the idea of using puff pastry in place of the dumplings, will try that next time.

I thought this was great. I did not use the eggs. Here's a tip I found on the web to prevent sauces from breaking when using something other than heavy cream, which I try to stay away from: Unlike heavy cream, lower-fat substitutes like half-and-half and evaporated milk tend to "break" or curdle when added to sauces. To prevent this from happening, heat the sauce over low or medium heat, or reduce the cream substitute before adding it to the sauce. Don't let the sauce boil. Cream sauces made with lower-fat cream substitutes also tend to have less body; to correct for that, consider adding 1 tablespoon flour or 2 teaspoons cornstarch to the sauce for every cup of evaporated milk substituted. Stir the thickener into a paste first to prevent lumps.

We loved this and neither of us has ever been fond of drop dumplings/biscuits. But this was delicious. The flavors were rich and creamy. I made half the printed recipe and added some parsnips I had on hand and used a homemade turkey stock. I had no trouble with the sauce. I think the egg is well buffered by the flour and the dumplings themselves. Mine certainly bubbled away - actually longer than called for. I did find the dumplings a bit heavy and the dough to be very stiff. They were more cut in than dropped. I will work on that in the future as I definitely will make this again. I didn't find the recipe difficult at all. In fact I prepared it all several hours in advance with the exception of adding the egg and cream mixture to the base and the milk to the dry batter ingredients. So actual cooking time at dinner was about 20 minutes.

Previous to putting in the dumplings I would have given this dish 3 stars, but after the dumplings I'd give it one star. The sauce was creamy and delicious before I simmered the dumplings. I used fat free half and half and fresh rosemary. I don't know how you can have the temperature high enough to cook the dumplings, yet not curdle the sauce. The sauce curdled and the dumplings were tough (perhaps too much handling?). I'd use the sauce again, pre-dumpling, and perhaps top it with pre-made puff pastry crust.

Great Scandinavian soul food. ;) The sauce is also wonderful served on waffles for a Pennsylvania-Dutch-style meal.

Oh My God. He's going to marry me. Ok, so maybe it's not the dumplings, but they sure helped. Let me add my two cents for newcomers. I only had about 1 cup of turkey, so i doubled the dumpling batter. The dumplings didn't keep their shape as well, but who cares, it's delicious. The turkey played second fiddle to the dumplings and the gorgeous sauce. The sauce should not break if you keep the temperature down and you stir/whisk often. YUM YUM YUM. Easy dish once you have your mise en place together.

I found this dish very flavorful and delicious. Its a wonderful winter comfort food and a smart way to use leftover turkey. A little time consuming though. I have made this twice now and have broken the sauce both times...Any hints?

Rating: 2
It was not that this is not a potpie that caused me to give the low rating, but the fact that it seems unnecessary to use an egg sauce in the type of dish that sits on the stove for so long. The risk of breaking the delicate custard sauce is too great while doing the other steps. Just not worth it. Either the traditional brothy chicken and dumplings or Miss Ruby's creamy (basically add a cream bechamel to the cooked chicken stock) are better and more stable.

I didn't think this was at all hard to make, or time consuming. It had a great flavor, and we really enoyed it. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and it worked well. BTW - these are "yankee dumplings" (not "southern"!) but we really enjoyed them anyway! (For St. Paul - southern dumplings - such as in South Carolina/Georgia's versions of chicken and dumplings - tend to be rolled thin and taste almost like a thick noodle. The dumplings that I have had up north tend to be drop biscuits and are more dough'y. But I think dumplings are great no matter where you are!)

I've already made this twice in two weeks. Once for my inlaws and now for the family. We all loved it. It's a wonderful comfort dish and the dumplings are great. I even used one can of vegetable stock with the chicken stock and it tasted great.

This recipe was easy and delicious. Since my husband and I prefer just white meat, I bought a half turkey breast and roasted it the night before. If you used canned broth, be sure to buy reduced salt type. Otherwise, don't add a drop of salt. That's all I had in the cupboard and it was a good thing I tasted the finished product before I added any salt. I can't believe anyone thought this was time consuming to make. Chopping up celery, onions and carrots (I cut the carrots in rounds, they fit better in your spoon!) took just few minutes. And the dumplings were awesome. I will double the recipe for those next time.

I, too, used homemade stock. The turkey base is good; the dumplings are WONDERFUL! I kept to both the ingredients and timing as stated (no creativity) for the best of this kind of dumpling result I've ever had -- and I've made them all: potato (cooked and raw), flour, liver, farina, matzoh...

I added lemon juice for a little zest. It was great.

This was delicious, and I have never before had success with dumplings! These were easy. Half and half was plenty rich, and I made the stock from scratch with turkey carcass, one onion, 2 stalks celery and leaves, bunch parsley stems, one carrot, five black peppercorns, and 1/2 lemon (try it you'll like it!). Just cover with water and simmer a long time, then reduce a little. Great recipe....and the rosemary was not too much at all for us.

A question for Raleigh, North Carolina. To further my culinary education, why are these yankee dumplings and not southern. Because they are drop biscuits not biscuits cut out from dough? Just curious. Thanks! Planning to make this based on all the helpful reviews.

I haven't made this recipe yet but it occured to me that you could also use a store bought roasted chicken as an alternative to the turkey. One chicken should supply the 4 cups of meat needed.

This is such an easy recipe. I used left over turkey bones to make stock, and the flavor was incredible. The dumplings were very light and tender. A big hit in my home.

There was nothing wrong with the flavor of this recipe, in fact it tasted pretty good, but I won't make it again. I don't think a recipe for leftover turkey should involve this much work, after spending all that time cooking the turkey. I did most of the chopping for this the evening before and it still took 45 minutes,with lots of stirring, to put it together.

Wonderful comfort food. I substituted anise for the celery and it was fabulous. Also omitted the egg yolks and cut the cream in half to make it less fattening. It was still wonderful. My husband loved it. I used all the rosemary and didn't think it was overpowering at all.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I lightened up on the rosemary (not being one of my husbands favorite herbs) and it was just right. Very creamy with light dumplings.

Wonderful, wonderful, and again, wonderful. I used fat-free half-n-half instead of heavy cream and skim milk instead of whole milk, and still this was an incredibly rich, delicious dish. What a great way to use leftover turkey!

This recipe is VERY good - nice comfort food for a cool fall dinner. I did however, find the rosemary a little on the heavy side - it does need it, but I would consider next time cutting back on the amount. YUMMY!
