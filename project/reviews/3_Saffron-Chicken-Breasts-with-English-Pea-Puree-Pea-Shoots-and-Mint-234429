Very tasty, though I would use a lot less oil and butter, especially if you're leaving the skins on the chicken. The end result was a bit greasy, which is counter to the point of this dish as a nice springtime dinner. Oh, and definitely pull all the leaves off the pea shoots and use only those. The stalks are very tough and chewy. Overall though, the dish had great flavors and was fairly easy to prepare.
