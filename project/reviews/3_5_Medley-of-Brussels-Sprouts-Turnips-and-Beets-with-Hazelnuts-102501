I adore this recipe! I brought it to a potluck Thanksgiving a couple years ago, and even the people who swore they didn't like brussels sprouts or beets (or both!) loved it - there was none left. I'm bringing it to another Thanksgiving this year. I mainly follow the recipe, but I also roast the turnips and sprouts as well as the beets for a richer flavor.

I found roasting the turnips and putting them on top of the other vegis when serving to be a good solution to keep them from turning pink when using red beets. The flavor of the turnips seemed enhanced by roasting. We enjoyed this and thought that the hazelnuts were delightful with it.

I really loved this - my husband does not like hazelnuts so I skipped them but next time I will try pine nuts. It had a beautiful presentation, was wonderfully healthy and tasted great!!

I also thought it was maybe a tad bland. I would make it again but I might add some fried crumbled pancetta or something a little extra for flavour.

Very bitter!! The brussels sprouts and beets were OK, but the turnips were so bitter that they overpowered the other flavors. The hazelnuts did nothing interesting or helpful. No one ate more than a bite of this dish with the concensus being, ick, bitter. If making this recipe, I might suggest using your own home-grown turnips that you know are sweet or eliminate them completely. Maybe toasted pine nuts instead of hazelnuts, too.

My vegetarian husband loved this since it had all his favorite vegetables in it. I thought it was good but not to die for.

Terrific taste, aroma and visual. And easy, to boot! Will keep this one in the file for future fall meals.

This was a wonderful addition to out Thanksgiving meal. Did all the prep the day before and only had to do the final 10 minutes or so as the turkey rested. Highly recommend sticking with the gold beets- they seem milder and sweeter than red ones.

I used parsnips instead of turnips and red beets instead of white beets because these were what I had on hand. It was delicious. I could have put in more hazelnuts. They were a great addition.

Hellloooo? Helloooo? McFlyyyyyy? Can anyone see the guy complaining about others complaining about the red beet complaints? What a buzz kill. I tell you what I made this for my wife, who normally spits out anything golden, and she seemed to love taking the red beets down! I would never complain to anyone about a beautiful, well endowed wife of three weeks who takes the red beets where it counts! Now she wants me to make it again, and again, and again, and again. Gents, do youreself a favor and make her the reds tonight!

I am amazed to see complaints from at least two reviewers saying that the beets stained everything else. HELLO!!! The recipe calls for GOLDEN beets, not red. If you don't follow the recipe, you have no right to complain!!

Disappointing and too much work. The vegtables were way too undercooked using the timing here. Also, the dish just never melded to produce a good flavor. I much prefer roasting vegtables for special dinners (had this one at Christmas). Try6 some other recipie.

I made this for Thanksgiving and was lucky enought to find white beets. It was a huge sucess! My mother-in-law asked me to bring it for Christmas, though I may have to use red beets. They had never had turnips, before and were suprised at how good they were.

Unlike the experience of the previous reviewer, this recipe was a hit at my Thanksgiving table this year. Doing the beets separately makes things a little less red, but the colorfulness of the recipe was also positive. Both my sister and my mother in law asked for the recipe.

I am a personal chef and find that often the people I cook for don't appreciate turnips. I substituted parsnips for turnips and heated the beets in the nut mixture in a separate pan. When we plated the meal we kept the beets separate and the beautiful red color was wonderful beside the green Brussel sprouts. Parsnips are a touch of sweet against the pungent sprouts, great with the roasted pork tenderloin with 3 mustard sauce on this site. The beets were especially good! Try it!

I made this last Thanksgiving. I like to try different things instead of the same old, same old. It was delicious - fresh and crisp. I never knew fresh beets and brussel sprouts were so good. I'm making it again tonight to have with steak and I'm going to add some asparagus and who knows what else. Try it!!

I thought it was an interesting idea, although the beets bled everywhere and turned everything purple. It was not the successful at Thanksgiving.
