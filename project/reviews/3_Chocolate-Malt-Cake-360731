This was not a simple cake to make, but it is definitely worth the time and effort. It was deliciously malty an amazing!!! Would make again in a heartbeat!!!

Fun to try unusual treatment of ingredients! Reduced sugar in milk crumbs and in cake batter, and used "European formula" of classic Ovaltine throughout - cake still rich, but not cloyingly sweet. Well received by dinner party guests - will make it again, making sure to pour/brush all the milk+Ovaltine on the cake layers, holding back some made the cake a bit dry.

Way too sweet. Looks and sounds amazing but the cake was not "brownie like" at all and was just way too sweet and unbalanced. So many better chocolate cake recipes out there.

I made this cake last Thanksgiving and have requests to make again this year, and will. If you have the time, start prepping a couple of days ahead of time and assembly is a breeze!

NOT worth the time or ingredients. Was really a pain to make - I only did so as my son requested I make it for his birthday. Don't bother.

This cake was good, but not as good as It looked. Think it was a lot more work than it was worth.

It was ok. Not great, just ok. Alot of prep for a just "ok" cake. Texture was a bit dry, not a moist cake and didn't pick up the malt flavor, overall. Much better recipes out there.

This cake was delicious and moist. Everyone at the dinner party raved about it and my husband keeps asking when I'm making it again.

I have to upgrade my review. The cake was quickly eaten in this household. So will do it again, it was much appreciated.

It is a lot of work but it is part of the challenge in my opinion. I think the Marshmallows really made it amazing.

my son wanted this as a 15th birthday cake. it took a bit of planning, a bit time consuming, but a very good cake. don't know why the others thought it was too dry, especially after soaking the layers with the ovaltine & milk! it also gave me a reason to finally use my torch to toast the marshmallows! very rich, a little goes a long way.

Too sweet and I've made better cakes. Interesting combos and inventive but not worth doing again. When I torch, I go get the real torch, not the woosey kitchen version. I will cross this recipe off.

This cake had lots of potential to be great, but I was really disappointed. The cake wasn't moist enough, super sweet, didn't taste very malty.

Please explain what you mean by "milk crumbs." Thank you.

Interesting ingredients but too much effort. The cake is good but not fabulous. Does not taste either the malt or cruchiness of malt crumbs. Not enough fudge sauce. Baking time for cake layers needs to be shortened--a bit dry.

You better love malt if you make this cake! Very "malty" and very sweet. Found the cake layers a bit dry. Made it for the first day of school because it looked fun and gooey with the marshmallows on top. Definitely not a kids cake. Strong, mature flavoring.

Was initially concerned about the amount of Ovaltine but it was a wonderful counterpoint to the chocolate cake. The cake was moist before adding the milk/ovaltine mixture and the addition of it made it fudgy. Loved the milk crumbs; would leave the marshmallows out next time and maybe use pecans or walnuts instead. Having said that, the cake presented beautifully and was a huge hit at the office.

Beautiful presentation, nice contrast with the milk crumbs and marshmallows. Very good, but not great. The cake is not as moist as I like a chocolate cake, in spite of the Ovaltine milk mixture. Quite a bit of work would have been worth it if it tasted as good as it looks. Won't try again.

This makes a perfect birthday cake with sparklers on top! It was a huge hit and I would certainly make this again. It's a pretty involved recipe, so make sure you have the time to devote to it. I had hoped it would taste more like a whopper, but it still tasted malty. The actual cake was almost fudgy from the malted milk that soaked into it. My favorite part was the marshmallows in between the layers. This cake is to die for!
