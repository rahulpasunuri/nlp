This recipe would benefit from fresh parsley, both in terms of flavor and appearance. It's a little beige and tastes rich without having any brightness. If I make this again, I'll add fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon.

I really enjoyed this. Seems labor intensive but aside from switching methods of cooking, it was a rich recipe but not heavy in the stomach. Not visually beautiful but very tasty.

made this recipe mostly as written, added a splash of balsamic vinegar to broth as it reduced. Unimpressed.

This recipe is excellent! I actually make it on a regular basis with Pork Tenderloin steaks or Pork Chops -- I simply sauté the pork in olive oil, sprinkling it with minced rosemary and seasoning with salt and pepper (the rosemary flavor adds to the Ragout). I deglaze the skillet with white wine and use the same skillet for the Ragout. The Ragout is fabulous, but I do make these changes: I use canned artichoke hearts and about 2 seeded/chopped tomatoes. Most importantly, we think it is so much better with 4T of cream added in the last step instead of the 4T butter. This is a delicious recipe, it is quite simple to prepare and is always a crowd pleaser. Most certainly try it!
