Really delicious...this is my favorite stuffing! It is a relatively dry stuffing, but I didn't find that to be a problem at all. However, if you like a moister style of stuffing, you'll want to add some liquid.

The flavors were great and worked well together. However, this didn't feel like stuffing because it didn't stick together. It became breadcubes and meat crumbles upon serving. Maybe add an egg to bind next time, plus use breadcrumbs instead of bread cubes.
