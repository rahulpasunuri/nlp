Stars -- schmars. I crowded 'em too much on the baking sheet -- and got a slab of crumbling cobblestones instead of neat li'l stars. These guys spread like cookies! I guess the piles of crumbs taste all right, but the "shortcakes" are way too messy and ugly to take to dinner; I'll have to try something else. Beware the oozing spread!

I am just wondering if anyone else experienced what I did: it seems (not including the one cup called for to serve as whipped cream with the finished product) that there is far too much chilled whipping cream called for in this recipe. 1 2/3 - 1 3/4 drowned the amount of dry ingredients and I had to make it over again....

The shortcakes are wonderfully rich and tender. Almost like devil's food cakes. Because I was working with little time and a 3 and 5 yr. old "helper", we just dropped the dough onto the cookie sheets without rolling out adn cutting. They were still beautiful when topped with vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries. And, sooo.... good. I only sprinkled with a little sugar too and did not do the "melted butter" thing before going into the oven. Perfect!

Absolutely wonderful!!! A definite keeper

So easy and so good! I use extra-large bittersweet chocolate chips and add twice as much of them than is called for, and with whipped cream and lightly sweetened strawberries this is fantastic.
