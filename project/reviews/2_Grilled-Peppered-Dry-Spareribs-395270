I'm not sure how we developed our cooking method for this recipe, but I think we combined an oven cooking recipe with this rub. We rub, bake uncovered at 200F, and sauce & cover for an additional hour. Point is, we love the rub but don't follow the recipe. My rating may be off, in that regard, but we use the rub often!

Hello, people in Epicurious. Where do you get two forks for this recipe, when I see only 2 of 1 fork ratings? Lately you have terrible recipes, written by cooking school first-graders.

The second I read the instruction to cook over DIRECT heat for the time specified I knew there had to be a mistake. Aqudoc summed it up best.

I agree with most of the previous comments; basting every 10 minutes for 3 hours? Not gonna happen. I think the recipe is poorly written. Either that or its someone's joke to see how many are gullible enough to waste that much time for pepper flavored charcoal.

I'm planning to prepare this recipe in a slow cooker/oven which would avoid the constant basting and turning as stated in instructions, since the spices used sound like a good combination of flavors. Will repost the results later.

I think "cooker" is pretty specific. That is not a "grill". This recipe should be fantastic in a cooker.

Wow, you're workin' for those ribs. Baste every 10 - 15 minutes...for THREE hours. IMHO move your ribs to indirect heat, cover and go have some fun w/ your guests for an hour. Flip, baste. Repeat every hour. After 3-4 cocktails your ready to serve.

Where could they have gotten this recipe from? Don't waste your time or your ribs on this.

I beleive that the recipe specifies the use of a "cooker" rather than a grill. This means something like a "Big Green Egg" which, by nature, is used for indirect grilling. The previous reviewers are correct in stating that this recipe wil fail if cooked over direct heat, however the recipe needs to be more explicit in its directions.

I agree. Directly over medium high heat is just the wrong way to cook these. They will be horrible.

Regarding A Cook from Hell's comment about time... I cook ribs all the time with various dry rubs for 3 hours or more but I think there is a mistake in this recipe. It stays cook over direct heat... I cook the ribs covered over indirect heat and so that the covered internal grill temp is 275 to 300 degrees. They always come out wonderfully crisp on the outside and falling off the bone tender and moist.

Do not use this recipe, if you never cooked ribs. Cooking ribs for 3 1/2 hours on direct heat will dry them to the bone, even if you spray them 20 times, what the recipe asks you. There is no time for marinating the meat. It is going straight to the heat and burn the rub.
