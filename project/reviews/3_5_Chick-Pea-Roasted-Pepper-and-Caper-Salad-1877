This has been my 'go to' summer side dish for years... I like to use extra mint, and sometimes add very finely diced red onion. When mint was not available, I used cilantro with great results. A wonderful, easy, healthy dish.

This was so tasty, I gave it four stars because it far exceeded expectations from the ingredients list, it was the other reviews that convinced me to try it. I put it over chopped romaine lettuce and people were smacking their lips.

Very easy to make. I loved the garlic. Not a huge mint fan so may try it with basil next time. Served it at a tapas party, lots of fun.

Very good, absolutely great the next day. I agree with the 2002 review about the procedure. I heated the garlic in part of the oil until it was golden, then tossed in the peppers. this made the garlic mellow rather than strong. I used all basil and it was fine. As with most recipes, you can fiddle with the seasonings until it's what you want. I added more lemon and salt. The next day I stirred a couple of spoonsful into a green salad and it was great. This is a keeper and a 4 season dish.

This makes a fantastic vegetarian lunch! Delish!

Delicious, quick, and healthy! I used mint and basil, unfortunately both dried, and added more lemon juice as well as salt and pepper. Oh, and cut the capers back by a tablesppon since I am not wild about them. After the minor tinkering, I would definitely make this again and frequently!

Very easy and very tasty. Great for a buffet. I served it over greens.

This has been one of my husband's and my favorites since I found in BA in 1992. Since I lost the recipe last year, I've wondered how to find it... and here it was! It was interesting to read reviewers additions (and I may try some), but we like it fine just the way it is - great combination of flavors.

After reading all the raves here, I thought this would be a surefire winner. It was ok, not bad, and certainly no work at all, but it was just no big deal. Unimpressive.

This was delicious, I sauteed the garlic first I couldn't taste the mint as much as I'd expected to even after I added more I'd definitely make this again

This is good as is, and also lends itself well to variations. White or kidney beans (or a combination of both) work well. Basil can be substituted for mint, as someone has already mentioned. Slivered olives can be added, or substituted for the capers.

Right ingredients, wrong technique - Heat the olive oil in a saucepan until hot, add one clove of chopped garlic and cook until just turning color. Then add the pimientos or roast peppers and toss. Let cool and then add chopped basil (instead of mint)and the drained capers. And yes, it can be made ahead if done this way.

I added about a teaspoon of lemon zest & it really brought out the minty flavor.

This is a light and refreshing side dish with a unique flavor. I think it would make a great addition to a summer picnic. Takes about 2 minutes to make. I might add a little bit of chopped red onion next time.

A delicious salad. Leave it sit a while. Serve at room temp. The mint really adds a nice flavour.
