As simple as this is, it is phenomenal! I made it the day before, doubling the paprika. I reheated it in a covered casserole at 350 for about 30 minutes. So easy! I'm making more right now to freeze and have on hand.

This was excellent. more than doubled spices, and substituted milk for 1/2 the cream. Even folks who 'don't like sweet potatoes loved it. And it was very cute in little ramekins.

Made this for Thanksgiving in 2011. The smoked paprika is a must, otherwise, it's just sweet potatoe puree. Pretty good and was well-liked.

I made this yesterday for thanksgiving dinner. It is delicious!!!!!!!! Even though i was not able to find the smoked paprika here in Ecuador and used regular paprika, it was delicious

I'm glad it was suggested to be a bit more heavy-handed with the paprika and cayenne. This recipe was a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. I had an urge to try out a new kitchen torch, so I did serve this in individual ramekins, sprinkled about 2 teaspoons of sugar on the top and hit it with the flame...sort of a sweet/savory sweet potato brulee. Thanks for the inspiration that brought me to that idea!

This was great. I served it with the Saumon aux herbes et lentilles from this site - YUMMY - a great contrast. I always double or triple spices, due to my insensitive palate, but I loved this. And so did my puppy!

I just made a 'practice' batch in prep for Thanksgiving and it's delicious. I think you can easily add more paprika and cayenne if you like a little more zing. The smokiness from the paprika works really well with the sweetness of the potato. It's definitely going on the menu.

Fabulous and simple. I'd double the smoked paprika next time, without much change to the cayenne. Did it in my stand mixer, and it was the perfect texture, nice and fluffy.

Served this on Thanksgiving. Different and easy. Added some creame fresh.

fantastic! Made this vegan by using soymilk and vegan margarine. Was a real hit.

A nice change of pace from the usual overly sweet sweet-potato dishes. Like several others I used an electric mixer rather than my processor. I prepared this a day ahead and simply reheated in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes.

mind-blowing!

I really liked this, and the family liked it too, which was amazing. I just bought some smoked paprika recently and really wanted to try it, and this was a perfect choice! I used a hand mixer because I didn't feel like dirtying the food processor. The only problem was bits of pureed sweet potato splattered all over the microwave, counter, and the mail! Definitely watch your speed.

How can you make baked sweet potatoes taste even better? You add butter! A bit of smoked paprika and cayenne didn't hurt either. Delicious!

DELICIOUS! Two of my favorite things - sweet potatoes and smoked paprika. Who knew they went together so well? I added more smoked paprika than this recipe called for, perhaps double. We'd have it again and again. And next time I might try putting them in ramekins and retuning them too the oven to get a crust on top.

I would make this again with the following changes. First, I would just mash the potatoes, the consistency was not very appealing. Second, more paprika and cayenne. I ended up doubling the amount of each and still couldn't really taste them, it just tasted like sweet potatoes with cream. This recipe sounds more exciting than it is, but I'll give it another shot.

This is delicious. It's one of the tastiest preparations of sweet potatoes we've ever had. No one in our family cares for candied sweet potatoes. This breaks away from that tradition and takes sweet potatoes to new heights. I used condensed milk in place of the cream (only because I had no cream on hand). Doubt that it made much of a difference. Everyone loved this dish.

I didn't care for this dish very much but everyone else raved. Even the kids wolfed it down. I used Penzey's smoked paprika (cannot recommend Penzey's too highly and have been using their spices for 15 years).

This is fabulous, and very simple; the smoked paprika is essential.

I LOVE this dish. I had to scale it back a lot to make it for myself but it was sure delicous. Leftovers weren't as good as the original but I'll surely make it again.

Also a great dish at our Thanksgiving dinner! I loved the smokey/hot/sweet taste. Couldn't find the Paprika but a spice store told me how to smoke it myself by adding 1/2 of a roasted pablano pepper I roasted myself the night before. I could have added it to the paprika but I just pureed it all together. I used a food processor with a light touch and the texture was great.

Best dish at our Thanksgiving dinner! Wonderful combination of smoky, hot and sweet. I used garnet yams (which are sweet potatoes) and followed the recipe as written. The paprika was hard to find but I finally located it at Sur La Table. I do not agree that the mixture is better if you use a mixer. I used a food processor and liked the pureed texture.

I did substitute garnet yams and was very happy. Unlike most holiday sweet potatoes, this version wasn't sweet, sweet, sweet. I nice balancing contrast.

It was tasty but I will switch the amounts of cayenne and paprika next time. I will also not puree, as it reminded me of baby food.

Delicious with a wonderfully smokey flavor. Do recommend using hand mixer instead of food processor.
