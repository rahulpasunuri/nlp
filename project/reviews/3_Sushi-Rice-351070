Season rice vinegar (which already has the sugar and salt) makes this simple recipe even easier. Also, we used medium grain rice with great success. It was less than half the cost of "sushi" rice.

This was easy to make and in the ballpark of what I wanted but if I make it again I'll use about twice as much (maybe more) rice vinegar.

Easy to make and tastes good.

No problems, tasted good. Used 2 1/2cp water to 2 cups rice as per the rice package. Might have been a little bit too much water.

this is a terrible recipe. I couldn't get the salt and sugar to dissolve in the vinegar, and after comparing this recipe to several others, I can see there is far too much salt and sugar and not enough vinegar. Also, we couldn't taste the vinegar/salt/sugar in the rice at all.

This recipe worked well - and it was my first time making sushi. I took some advice from other recipes I found and added 1 tablespoon of sake and used 2 1/2 cups of water

We have made this several times. It is easy to make and produces great results. What more can you ask for in a sushi rice recipe?

Had to add more water, and ended up cooking it a little longer than I should have, but it still turned out pretty well.

Good recipe. Easy and perfect to make ahead and assemble later. Makes enough for about 6/7 rolls, depending on size.
