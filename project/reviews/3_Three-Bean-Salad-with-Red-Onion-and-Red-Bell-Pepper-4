this is a simple basic summer bean salad recipe. I have to say it did need to be seasoned to taste and I thought fresh basil would have been much better. I did use half the amount of onion as 1/2 of one seemed a bit much.

rather tasteless, even after adding more salt,pepper and vinegar.

mmmmm...I just made this for a quick lunch. It really is good. I used black, cannellini, and pinto beans, 2 cloves of garlic & fresh basil. I added a little s&p and the juice of half a lemon. I also had on hand some leftover lemon-herb chicken that I shredded and added to it to make a complete meal. So good! I can imagine that it will be even better tomorrow and chilled.

Tried this with fresh, blanched green beans and increased the spices. Since my husband doesn't like garbanzo, used white beans. Came out tasting fresh and lively.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and got raves. It was well worth the effort. I didn't have any fat on top to skim during the braising, so was amazed at the amount in the pot the next day after chilling it. I froze the left-over sauce in ice cube trays and then put them into a ziplock bag. I've used them to enhance the flavor of other dishes.

I substituted black beans for the green beans, 1/4 c. vegetable oil for the olive oil, fresh basil or parsley for the dried, & 1/4 c. apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I also added sugar, to taste. This tastes better the next day.

Excellent recipe with the following revisions provided by other critics: substitute black beans for green; use more wine vinegar (5 T) and garlic (2 cloves); add chopped jalapeno. It was so good, in fact, that I plan to make it again next week for a Memorial Day picnic.

As the previous reviewer said, I added black beans instead of green and I also added 2 finely chopped, seeded jalapenos and a little extra vinegar and oil. This gave this dish an added zing. I took it to a Church function and it went over extremely well with many requests for the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

This is nearly identical to a recipe my family got from my grandfather. My grandfathers recipe has 1/2 cup veg. oil, 1/2 cup vinegar and 3/4 sugar in the mix as well, and its a green bell pepper instead of a red pepper. My suggestions are to use apple cider vinegar and make it the day before. It needs a day for all the tastes to mix together. The sugar gives it a sweet and sour effect if you want to try it. I'll just sit with the bowl and eat it or add it to a salad. Then you don't need salad dressing.

This salad was okay. I didn't think it had enough pizazz. I even added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and it still tasted kind of bland. If I made it again I would probably add more garlic and some red pepper flakes, but I probably won't bother.
