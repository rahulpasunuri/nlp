This was delicious and I can't belive that I'll be the first to review it! The colors and flavors were beautiful. Mackerel is just a great (and cheap!) fish to cook with. We left out the dill and used yogurt instead of creme fraiche. No need for ascorbic acid... the vinagrette was green as can be. Next time I'll up the horseradish a bit for a livlier kick, and add the beets as a separate layer so the salad is not quite so pink.
