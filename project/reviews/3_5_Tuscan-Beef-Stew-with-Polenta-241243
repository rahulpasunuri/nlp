I made this recipe last night and I thought it was amazing with a few changes. I browned the meat in batches 1st and the set aside. Then sauted the veggies plus garlic and equal parts oil and flour creating a roux, returned the meat. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh. In the last 30 minutes as other suggested added baby bella mushrooms. increased the salt and pepper and other added a bit of granulated garlic. Served over mashed potatoes. It was so delicious!!

Cooking time says 15 minutes.... but it also says simmer 2 hours. Can we fix that?

I thought this was good. Based on previous reviews, I made a few basic modifications. Because there were several comments that this stew was too thin, I lightly dredged the beef in flour. I also browned the meat first, took it out and then cooked the vegetables. Lastly, there aren't any fresh tomatoes worth eating or cooking with right now, so I used canned (drained tomatoes). Oh, and I did add some parmesan to the polenta while it cooked. I thought this was good, husband thought it was great. I'll make it again...

Good but not great. I felt it was a little bland and that I could have used a little less red wine. Perhaps a bay leaf and some herbes de provence would have helped. In regards to the thickness issue- I spooned out half a cup of broth and mixed a tablespoon of flour into it, then poured it back into the pot. That made the consistency perfect. I'm not disappointed with this recipe but I feel there may some better recipes out there.

I think this is a very good stew recipe. I used 1lb pork shoulder and 1lb chuck. Also used Compari tomatoes (6). Added just red wine, a bottle, who measures! Did it in the pressure cooker for 45 min. Took out the tomato skins and strained the liquid. I reduced the liquid and added some wondra flour to thicken. The reduction really intensified the sauce and was a drop down winner. I also put a few bacon crumbles on the polenta for texture. Don't use the instant polenta the real deal is too easy to use and tastes infinitely better.

I should have read the reviews before I started this recipe or at least relied on my own intuition. The meat wouldn't brown, but the vegetables sure did. So I threw in the wine and thyme, then the tomatoes. I will just have to see how it works out. Bad Italian that I am, I'm not a fan of polenta. I'm thinking about adding fingerling potatoes. Smells good!

I will use water for the polenta next time, the stock seemed to overwhelm the flavor of the polenta. otherwise we absolutely loved it.

I browned the meat separately, couldn't imagine it browning otherwise, and at the end added a couple cups of quartered mushrooms and a couple cups of frozen peas--the extra green color was great. Also added garlic at the end, but even before adding the extras the dish was very flavorful, thyme seasoning very nice with the polenta, onion making for a lot of sweetness. A strong basic stew recipe. I may add turnips next time, their flavor sets off a sweet stew sauce so nicely. Thin sauce not a problem with polenta.

Great recipe! I used the pre made polenta that comes in a tube, cut it into one inch thick cakes and seared it on both wides. Poured the stew over the top. Worked great.

A very tasty dish. I didn't have quite enough wine, but it was still very good. I used dry thyme and a couple of bay leaves.

Excellent on a cold night. I kept the onions, celery, and carrots, but added a small portion of chopped shallots. Dried thyme instead of fresh, and grape tomatoes. Merlot makes the meat so tender. I wasn't concerned with the thinness of the stew because I ladled it over polenta. Instead of this polenta recipe,I used the baked polenta with fontina cheese recipe here on Epicurious.

Turnips are a welcome addition to this stew, as I've just discovered. Looking forward to trying the other tips mentioned here.

Thanks to all the reviewers! I made some changes to address the issues you mentioned and loved the results. Because a lot of folks mentioned how runny the stew was, instead of tomatoes, I used a small can of tomato paste. I was worried about the chuck, because I didn't have time to use the crock pot, but I cubed the meat one inch by half inch, and I managed to cut it with a fork after an hour and a half cooking. I coated the meat with flour and followed the advice of one of the reviewers and browned the meat first. Careful with that, the flour can get stuck to the bottom of the pan and burn (found out the hard way...) I also added a couple bay leaves. I served to friends who came over and everyone loved it!

I adapted this for my slow cooker. Cannot believe how tender the meat ended up. I prepared a full recipe which served 4+ as a main dish.

Made this last night and the flavors are delicious. Makes for a a very tasty dish, similar to what my Northern Italian MIL makes but her stew has a much thicker consistency, which our family prefers. Though the recipe is flavor- packed, I think it would benefit further to coat the meat first lightly in flour, then sear to brown in the olive oil, remove and keep warm. The carrot, celery and onion could then be sauteed in the same pot and better pick up the seared meat drippings. Once the celery, onion and carrot are cooked down, you could optionally puree them with an immersion blender or at least mash them down a bit (an easier sell to kids for sure!) before adding back the beef, wine and tomotoes etc... I also prefer to remove tomato skins prior to adding them to the overall sauce. Easily done by scoring them with an X and pouring boiling water overtop of them for a few mins and then peeling them. My MIL prepares her polenta more simply with 2 parts water to one part milk + a dash of salt for the liquid vs. using a stock. It makes for creamier polenta that doesn't complete with the intensity of flavors in the stew. She pours the cooked polenta into a glass serving dish, cools it down and slices it for the stew to be ladled over top. Excellent accompanied by slices of strong Italian cheese like reggiano or piave.

This stew turned out very delicious for New Years Eve. For wine I chose Yellow Tail Merlot, and it did not turn out sweet, as I read in other reviews. Instead of celery, I added 2 sliced zuccini to the stew 20 minutes before serving. For more flavor, I added twice the amount of ground pepper, and even added some to taste after it was served. I also added 2 minced garlic cloves just 10 minutes before serving. Instead of fresh tomato (hard to find nice red ones in January) I used organic canned, and rinsed them before adding to the stew. Instead of polenta, I cooked one cup of Aborrio rice. I think everything turned out very well. If I were to make this again, I'd follow other cooks' suggestions to sautee the beef in flour to thicken the stew. I think the meat would be more tender by using a slow cooker. All in all, this was an excellent ethnic dish!

This was my first time I made this recipe, and I didn't follow it exactly. Instead of celery, I put in 2 zucccini (sliced) into the stew during the last 20 minutes. I also added 2 minced garlic cloves to add flavor (during last 10 minutes). I put in twice as much pepper. For the wine I used Yellow Tail Merlot-- and it turned out tasty, not sweet as the other reviews have mentioned. I didn't use polenta, instead 1 cup aborrio rice. If I were to make this stew again, I think I would most definitely use the slow-cooker instead. Otherwise, I'd cook this stew for nearly 3 hours instead of 2.

I've made this three times. VASTLY improved by (a) adding 2-3 tablespoons of flour to the sauteed vegetables and continuing to sautee for a couple of minutes, and (b) adding a pinch of cayenne to balance out the sweetness of the wine. Also used some quartered criminis.

I really liked it, It's a matter of style, its a little thin for my taste. I used half the wine, a little garlic, salt and pepper. I'll make it again with whipped potatoes.

Would like to give 3.5 since I'm not a big beef stew eater. Husband is and thought it was just okay. Forgot the polenta but served it with crusty french bread for dipping. Pretty tasty.

A bit boring. I too browned the flour covered beef first, and it still didn't have the thickness I was hoping for. Plopped the polenta in the bottom of the bowl then ladled the stew over it. Helped, but still just too boring to make again.

For those with consistency issuess, give this a try: brown meat first (do not flour, will only burn). Remove meat. Add vegetables and saute until soft. Now add flour and stir for ~2 mins. Carry on with rest of recipe as written.

Really delicious! Next time I would try adding potatoes, more carrots and celery and lowering the amount of red wine and meat a bit to make it easier on the wallet (and less meaty). Also, used a vegetable bouillon cube instead of stock for the polenta and this was very good. Will definitely make this again. And it has the added excitement of making the beef purple! That was a surprise...

My husband liked it a lot, but if you are like me and do not enjoy sweet soups, then you might want to re-think this one. The beef, after soaking i 2.5 cups of wine for 2 hours, tasted a bit like candied beef.

Decent beef stew, but lacked the richness I was looking for. I think a few changes in the cooking techniques would help tremendously. If I made it again, I would dredge the beef in a little flour, salt & pepper, then brown it first. This will create a nice fond on the bottom and also thicken the sauce a bit. THEN saute the onions/carrots/celer y and deglaze with the wine. I also threw in a bay leaf along with the thyme. Now all this said, my family enjoyed the stew and it WAS very easy to throw together on a weeknight. We're not big on polenta, so I served over mashed potatoes which are always a hit at our house!

I read the reviews before cooking and noted that the sauce might be thin. While I prepped the veggies, I tossed the beef with a bit of worstershire and wine, plus a couple of drops of soy sauce. As recommended by another reviewer, I tossed the beef with some flour before cooking. I also added some flour in toward the end. I think I should have avoided using all this flour and just done it Debbie's way. My result is nice but not different than an American beef stew or pot roast. I should have left the Italian brothiness of it alone and let the polenta suck it up!

Tenderize the stew meat and achieve heartier wine flavor by marinating the meat in the wine in a sealable plastic bag in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours. Drain the meat and pat dry with a paper towel before browning. Use low sodium beef or chicken broth in place of wine when cooking.

This was great! I really loved the fresh tomatoes how they just slowely cooked down. I did cook mine for about 21/2 hours though until I was happy with how tender the meat was. I also found it a bit watery so would perhaps coat my meat in flour first to thicken up the sauce next time.

I halved the recipe for two and there was plenty for leftovers. The stew recipe is excellent as is. I agree that It does need a hefty wine. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon. Made my polenta using the recipe straight from the Bob's Red Mill Polenta package and adding some grated fontina cheese at the end, just sliced it, placed it in the bowl and ladled the stew on top. Fantastic!

This is a wonderful cold weather meal. I used a 14 oz tin of diced tomatoes rather than fresh ones and added garlic. Easy to prepare and a definite keeper.

Wonderful on a cold night. Needs a wine with muscle. A Syrah perhaps. Did not change basic recipe, cut in half for two though with no problem.

This simple stew has tons of flavor and is very tasty. I did add a few extra herbs and I browned the meat first and set aside. Then I deglazed the pan and sauted the veggies. This one is a keeper.

What, no garlic?? I added garlic right at the tail end of cooking the vegetables.

I'm from Italy, from a place where we made polenta. The original polenta is made with water and not with stock. 3 cups of water and 1 of coarse cornmeal and a pinch of salt. When it is cooked we transfer it to a bowl rinsed with whater and still wet. try this version more light and more ...italian
