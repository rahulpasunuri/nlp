With some modifications, this would be 4 forks. The recipe I have been making since college and always get rave reviews is about the same but with following changes: increase eggs to 2, increase sugar to at least 1 cup brown and up to 1 cup white (depending on how sweet you want it - like the Splenda idea, will try that). To make even healthier, I now use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and no one seems to be able to tell the difference. I usually use chocolate chips, 2 cups, and nuts. White chocolate chips with macadamia nuts is really wonderful. If oatmeal-raisin, I also add cinnamon to batter. If you like smoother texture, you can simply blenderize the oats. If flour is dry, it may need a tablespoon or 2 of milk. With these changes this is family favorite basic cookie dough, additions being changed according to the season.

My daughter and I just made these cookies and they were "hard to stop eating" according to my daughter. I did half the reciepe but still used the whole egg. Used splenda brown sugar and dried cherries instead of raisins.watch your cooking time and these cookies should turn out great!

I can't believe anyone said it was dry, crumbly or that the cookies were hard! This cookie turned out moist and chewy. I would say lower the heat in your oven when baking.Or shorten the baking time. I used dark brown sugar instead of light,omitted the raisins,and used a whole bag of chocolate and peanut butter chips. Everyone loved them!

This cookie was far from gross. It was very good, however, I did reduce the amount of oatmeal and because I did not use unsalted butter, I reduced the salt somewhat. One thing I did was to add some Herseys Chocolate Cocoa (powder). This really added to the cookie! I will definately make this again, with the cocoa added!!

I don't understand the negative reviews. Not only have these cookies disappeared quickly, but I've also had requests for the recipe. The only change I make is to reduce the oatmeal content and correspondingly increase the chips and raisins. The last time, I had no chocolate chips, so I substituted a few chopped Hersey bars.

This cookie was very easy to make but if you didn't get it baked just perfect it tasted as if it were metal?? It was also very floury tasting. Sincerly, Ann

I'm not sure what happened with your batch, but I've used this recipe several times with much success. I've found it to be a good, basic, everyday kind of cookie. In fact, I was just looking it up to make it again because I couldn't find my copy of it.

Did I do something wrong? My dough was very dry and crumbly. I could hardly press the dough together, let alone "drop" it by tablespoons. The cookies turned out hard as rocks, though they taste good. Any advice to offer?
