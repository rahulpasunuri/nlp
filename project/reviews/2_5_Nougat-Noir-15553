This recipe is great. The recipe is for nougat noir which means "black nougat". Nougat blanc, which means "white nougat", is - granted - what most are used to and is made with egg WHITES. And yes this recipe does resemble brittle, but in other countries brittle is not the word used to describe this particular recipe. Hence, the different names, nougat noir vs. nougat blanc.

This sounds like brittle, not nougat. Where are the egg whites???
