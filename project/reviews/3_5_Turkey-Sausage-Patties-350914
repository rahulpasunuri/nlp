This was delicious and easy to make. I didnt have any nutmeg on hand so used Allspice instead and the combination of spices was delicious....I would say that I prefer sausage recipes with sage but it was still very tasty and delish.

I usually make a poultry tortiere for Christmas Eve, but trying to simplify things this year, I made this instead. The only thing I added was half a cup of finely chopped celery to the onions and borrowed the idea of chilling the mixture for a couple of hours to facilitate the ease of making the patties. I think this is an excellent recipe that I'll come back to again and again.

FABULOUS! I used Japanese Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs which give a little more body to the sausages. Instead of browning too dark, I suggest that you saute just enough to give some nice color to both sides. Then add a few tablespoons of water, cover and cook over low- medium-low heat for the last 10-15- plus minutes just till cooked through. Nice and juicy! Perfect seasonings! A welcome (and healthy) new addition to our Holiday breakfast/brunch menu!

WOW! My entire family RAVED about this all morning long after serving it for Xmas brunch. We used 93/7 lean ground turkey (couldn't find dark meat), but the flavor was still outstanding! One note - recommend you make the sausage mix and then chill for at least an hour or two. Makes the meat much easier to form into patties.
