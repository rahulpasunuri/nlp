This recipe typifies Roman, and indeed Italian, cooking. Is can only succeed if all the ingredients are of the very best quality. The pasta must be excellent, the pecorino must be real Italian high quality pecorino and the pepper corns must be toasted. Any shortcuts will turn this into what some of the reviewers have described..... dry and tasteless...yuck! When made properly, this is a sensory delight; a celebration of delicious simplicity.

This was awesome. Probably the simplest ingredient list I've ever encountered (although Mario Batali had a couple of powerful dishes like this that were almost as simple). The toasting of the peppercorns gave me a COMPLETELY new taste, something I've never experienced. Perfumed the kitchen and living room, and I had questions from my spouse as to what was cooking. And it was only from the toasted pepper! Cheese grated fine using the box grater with the ragged-edged holes. Make sure you aren't timid on the salt in the water, and use a GOOD pasta like De Cecco or at least Barilla. If you don't salt your water sufficiently, taste will suffer greatly. Pasta water should always taste like the sea. This dish is on my permanent serve list!

YUM! just what I wanted. simple, delicous, EASY PEASY! you can grate the cheese while the pasta is cooking and that is the bulk of the work you need to do. Rather than bother with the whole pepper corns crushing them with the pan as the recipe suggests, I heated a small pan, adjusted my pepper grinder to "coarse" and ground the pepper directly into the pan. Then I just shook the pan around with the pepper in it for about 30 seconds until I could really start to smell a stronger pepper flavor (think toasting spices). Worked great. Oh and they are not kidding about the specific grating of the cheese!

If you use more pasta water (maybe 3/4 cup) with about 2 teaspoons of good olive oil, the cheese mixes in, coats the pasta and it makes it almost creamy. Just add a little at a time till the pasta absorbs the water. Delicious!

Not bad, but if you make it, just be prepared for a simply-flavored dish. I imagine having very high quality cheese would make this much better. Watch out for wayward peppercorns getting caught in your throat... cough cough.

This recipe was good, but did not receive raves from my family. Probably because when they looked at it, they were expecting another dish I make called Spaghetti with browned butter and cheese, which is much richer in flavor. This, however, was very tastey, andI can't imagine anyone thinking it's bland. I wonder if they remembered to salt the pasta cooking water?

Toasting peppercorns takes this from good to great. I used whole- wheat pasta and tossed it with a little basil- infused olive oil before adding the cheese.

This recipe produces an authentic version of the Roman dish known as cacio e pepe. Unlike just making pasta and mixing it with cheese and pepper, this recipe produces a distinctive texture and pungent flavor from still-grainy cheese and the bite of bigger pieces of black pepper. If you resist adding olive oil and follow the steps to keep the bowl hot and damp and the pasta as hot as possible, the cheese will melt just enough to coat the strands while leaving some texture. In my experience of eating (both home-made and in Rome) and making this dish, the other important step is to not grate the cheese too finely (i.e., don't use a rasper) because it will then melt too fast and the pasta will clump together. I love this dish and make it often, especially to serve with a veal roast or along side osso buco.

Followed the recipe but did add a splash of olive oil as suggested. Simple but good eating.

I've been using epicurious recipes for several years now. I never make a recipe without reading the comments first. This is the first time I've rated a recipe myself. I have one word for this recipe--YUCK!

This dish was very plain and quite dry. I had much better results when I simply made plain spaghetti (cooked with enough olive oil to prevent it from sticking together) and topped it with freshly ground black pepper and plenty of shredded romano. The effort involved with all the extra steps described in the recipe just didn't seem worth it to me. It has became one of my favorite easy side dishes.

This seemed so plain. I couldn't figure out how to fix it up so I just served small portions to my guests so we could get to the next course.

Easy, basic recipe for a simple dinner. Make sure to use really good cheese! I needed to add a bit more pasta water since it was dry, but overall a subtle, enjoyable dish. Served it w/peas cooked w/dill and bacon.

A wonderful main or side. I used pre-grated grocery store house brand romano (aged 9 months) which melted beautifully. I suggest adding a couple of drops of olive oil to the pasta after transferring to the warmed bowl (before adding cheese) to prevent the pasta from sticking. The trick here is also to work fast since the cheese is likely to melt upon contact with steaming pasta. Romano is pungent and an acquired taste - this recipe should also do well with parmesan if you prefer a lighter dish. Served it with roasted chicken thighs as directed in Thomas Keller's recipe ("My Favorite Roast Chicken", on this website) and boiled haricot vert. My company enjoyed it.

This is the best pasta ever! Everyone thinks I add a secret ingredient - I love to surprise them with the recipe. I use Angel Hair. Be sure to use high quality cheese.

Delicious! This dish was easy to make and everyone loved it. I served it as a main course with a simple salad on the side. Don't be stingy when adding the cooking water, as 3 tablespoons may not be enough.

Pretty good and super quick, so makes for a decent meal when you don't have much time to cook. Tastes like a grown-up mac and cheese.

Delicious! We just returned from Rome last month and I brought back Pecorino Romano from Volpetti (a cheese shop mentioned in the Rome/March 2003 issue of Gourmet). I would highly recommend bringing back hard cheeses to anyone who travels to Italy. The quality is so much better than what you can get here. I had this dish a couple times when I was in Rome: yes, it as simple and as pure as you can get and this recipe reproduces it very well (especially when you use Pecorino from Rome!).

What's the big deal? I admit the recipe is somewhat different from most pasta dishes, but the final outcome isn't that great. It's a very basic, albeit quirky, way to prepare a quick Sunday night dinner. But I wouldn't bother making it again.

A simple, but delicious dish. To the cook from NY, I had the same problem, so I called my local gourmet cheese shop. I had bought the Pecorino Romano from the grocery store due to time constraints, and it seemed moist when I grated it. The woman from the cheese shop said their Pecorino Romano is aged four years and is dry like Parmigiano Reggiano. She thought that the one in the grocery store was probably aged about one year. I hope this helps!

I love this dish but the cheese is not melting properly and I'm ending up with clumps. I've made it twice and it's happened both times. Any suggestions?

This was absolutely delicious! I served this as a side dish with some balsamic chicken thighs. Although that was wonderful, I would love to try it next time without anything too saucy, that intrudes on the simple but incredible flavor of the dish alone. WOW! Can't wait to try it again.

i absolutely love the simple, delicious results of simply prepared food. served this with a stuffed chicken breast dish, and the cheese was an excellent flavour for both. be sure to toast your peppercorns! remember to keep some pasta water too - it will be needed. most importantly, use high-quality cheese. you'll want to put it on everything else...
