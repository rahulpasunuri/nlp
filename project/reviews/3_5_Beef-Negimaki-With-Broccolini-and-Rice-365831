I really wanted to like this dish, but for some reason, it just wasn't that great. I love Hoisin sauce, but it tasted odd with the beef cooked this way. My husband refused to eat more than two pieces and he will eat anything. My most disappointing Epicurious recipe to date.

First the idea of a no clean up dinner is nice but it didn't come out as good as everyone said on her. The first problem was that it came out soupy. The veggies and rice were cooked to perfection and had good flavor. The meat though was chewy. I think if it was shaved very thin and then wrapped around the veggies it might help. My meat was cut about .25 inches thick, definitely not thin enough. I also would add a little minced ginger and garlic to the marinade. I think that a little lemon grass might also help.I probably won't make this again.

The meat came out a little bit dry but i think that was on me so watch the cooking time. Also you have to double wrap with aluminum since the toothpicks tend to make holes then all you chicken broth leaks out

I liked recipe, but made a few changes. I cooked the rice seperately using chicken stock. Same with the greens, but I had aspargus. For the beef, I marinaded as suggested but put the rolled up beef, scallion and carrot on a skewer and grilled directly for about 8 minutes.

I did not make this exactly according to the recipe. I made the brown rice seperately. I also cut the vegetables in thicker matchsticks, and used red peppers with the carrots and scallions. It was good, but not great. I definately want to try it again though, and next time I would 1. marinate the meat for a couple of hours, and 2. put very little chicken broth in the packets. 1/4 cup of broth is too much if you have no rice in the packet. Ten minutes was a pretty accurate cooking time, but this is a dish that needs to be eaten immediately. My husband was late getting home from work and all the veggies were pretty soggy by then. I also don't know how well this will do as a left-over. It seems like a dish only good right off the grill. But definately worth another try!

Totally over cooked it as we are getting used to a new Weber grill. But even given that fact we can't wait to try it again. Great flavors and my husband couldn't believe I did rice on the grill. Didn't change a thing in the recipe.
