I have this recipe cooking in my oven right now. Using M. Bannecker's suggestions, this has become a regular at our house. I am using olive oil to rub the chicken rather than butter, otherwise follow those suggestions quite closely. Thanks for your input!

Even if you don't like watercress very much, give this recipe a try. If you do like watercress, consider a few twists I added to the recipe. I was delighted with the outcome. First, I added a few tablespoons of olive oil and two cloves of chopped garlic to the chopped watercress, making a paste before stuffing it under the chicken skin. Then I turned the remaining watercress into a simple salad. Tossing it with basalmic vinegar, lemon zest, olive oil and salt and pepper. I addes some diced tomatoes and a few thin slices of red onion. Finally, after carving the chicken, I served the warm meat on top of this watercress salad. The leaves wilted slightly making it a delicious and healthful meal. M. Bannecker
