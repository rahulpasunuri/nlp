Very easy for a weeknight dinner and got thumbs up from the whole family. I did add one clove minced garlic and a small crumble of rosemary and sage leaves as suggested by another cook, since I was serving it over plain linguine. Will make this one again!

This is a great weeknight sauce that my kids love and so do the grown ups. Because she suggests serving it on a pasta flavored with sage and rosemary (and because I am too lazy to make that myself) I always crumble a little dried rosemary and dried sage into the sauce before the simmer stage -- gives it a nice complexity. I also add a dash of red wine if I have some on hand. Terrific.

This recipe has been a keeper with me for 11 years -- when I first found it here! All these different tweaks are ridiculous...bread???? This is SUPPOSED to be an easy quick alternative to a ragu. The only difference I`ve made is to add a touch of garlic and I`ve substituted ground lamb for the veal at times and, of course, I`ve always added more parmie because you cannot have enough cheese on this. Note to the cook from Chicago (no offense intended) -- the tips may be better received by Purina.

This recipe sounded delicious, but after reading a few of the dissapointed reviews I made a few changes. Before browning the veal I put it in my food processor with the leaves from 2 rosemary stems, a slice of white bread, and 1 tablespoon of whole milk, this panade kept the veal from drying out while I cooked it with the onions and tomato slices, and gave it a really nice texture on the pasta. I also added 2 minced cloves of garlic in with the onions to give it an extra kick and cooked the whole thing in a large saute dish to give it more surface area while cooking. The end result was absolutely fantastic, definitely a keeper.

I obtained this recipe from an article in GQ, of all places, by a guy who went to Marcella's Venice cooking school for a week. It's simple and incredibly tasty. My wife asks for it regularly. I have also varied the recipe by using duck instead of veal, and adding red wine, garlic, and more butter, which works as a good substitute for the far more complicated duck ragus I've made before. An egg papardelle makes a terrific vehicle. Also, make enough for leftovers, because it's even better the next day!

This recipe was completely disappointing. In essence it is ground veal with chopped tomatoes in it. There is nothing resembling a sauce. I had to quickly substitute a dinner dish rather than serve it to my family.

This was very good and simple to prepare. The author is right, the homemade pasta with a thyme was just the right addition. We will have it again.
