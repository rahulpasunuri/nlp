I don't usually do reviews but this wonderful bread deserves all of the support it can get. 1000 percent better than any of the gluten free breads in the super mkt. I did just as the recipe called for except I used a pre mixed gluten free flour and added a bit of water to get it loose enough to fold in the egg white.

I made several gluten free focaccia recipes for a GF friend. They were both good. This was a bit more moist than some of the others. Ricing a potato is a pain in the butt though!

I love this bread. I've been looking for a gluten free bread like the one I purchase at Whole Foods. I made this after reading the previous one review and decided to add the potato when mixing the dry ingredients. It came out perfectly soft and moist. So good! I will be making this again and again! :-)

This is not a light focaccia, much more dense and chewy than I expected. My dough seemed much stiffer than described. (Recipe also didn't say when to add the riced potato, I added it in the dough mixing step). I wasn't able to "fold- in" the stiff egg white, but added it and continued mixing w/beater blade of stand mixer. I know this lost the air in the egg, but dough wasn't making a ball and I felt the moisture of the egg would help it hold together, which it did. I didn't get much rise, probably due to the stiff dough. It's tasty and I don't mind the chewiness, just different than described. If I try again I will add more water in proofing the yeast.
