Simple and delicious, made with items that should always be on hand. As always with a recipe having these few ingredients, quality is a must; using the best olive oil, fresh parsley, garlic and quality cheese.

If you love pasta and potatoes, find Mark Bittman's "The Minimalist Cooks at Home." His recipe calls for a couple slices of bacon, sauteed before adding the potatoes, and some garlic. Lightly brown the potatoes, then cook in water with whole canned tomatoes until almost tender, then add assorted leftover pasta from your cabinets. Absolute comfort food.

I stumbled across this while searching for "potatos" and "pasta", since those are two things I had and wanted to use up. It was a little bland; I added some chopped carrots and substituted spinach for parsley, but next time I would definitely add some garlic, maybe some peppers of some sort, and use broth instead of water.
