Made for my husband and I for a weeknight dinner - they are great sandwiches. The recipe is a little confusing. I 'buttered' the bread with some of the parmesan mixture and broiled it 'til golden. I then layered 2 pieces with medium sized asparagus that I halved and cooked in the MW. Ham (from Easter) went on top of the asparagus then the cheese mixture. I broiled for a couple minutes until cheese was browned and sort of melted. I put the 2nd piece of bread on top and butter each of the top slices a little.

So simple! I made this sandwich for my bf who raved about it. I gave it 3 forks bc it was a bit heavy for my taste, maybe I'll use less spread next time.

I made this recipe using prosciutto instead of regular ham. It is very delicious but very rich. If using Prosciutto, then do not salt the water that you cook the asparagus in. I plan to try many variations on this recipe: with tomatoes, with roasted red pepper, etc.

These are so quick, delicious, and pretty! Rather than make 2 large sandwiches, I adjusted the recipe slightly and made 15 open-faced finger sandwiches. I took them to my book club meeting, and everyone loved them... even the girls who didn't like asparagus! I almost couldn't get them out the door b/c my boyfriend liked them so much. I will definitely make them again, and I highly recommend!

Wow, talk about a tasty sandwich! I felt the recipe called for way too much asparagus, so I just put enough on the bread to ensure every bite had some. An excellent sandwich for a picnic.

This was a great way to make a fancy ham & cheese sandwich, with some fresh asparagus added for good measure. Instead of regular mayo, I used wasabi mayonaisse, and that gave it a nice kick that melded well w/ the other flavors. Got raves at the luncheon!

This recipe is very easy and oh-so delicious. I took another reviewers suggestion for using tomato in place of the ham, and I boosted the flavor by roasting the tomato slices and asparagus spears with olive oil and garlic before broiling the bread and heating the whole thing with Swiss cheese.

This is so simple, yet so FANTASTIC, I would give it 10 stars/forks if I could. My son, who hates vegetables, nags me constantly now to make these melts- for breakfast, lunch, midnight snacks, etc. For a heartier version, I've made them on French bread portions with thick slabs of smoked ham; for lighter fare, deli slices on thin Italian. Because I intend on serving these at my next brunch, I also tried it with fresh tomato slices in place of the ham, for my vegetarian guests. Also excellent!

I made this for my husband and myself one lazy sunday morning. We both loved it. It is definately one I will serve when we have overnight guests.
