I have made this recipes for years and it is always a hit. I made one major revision to the recipe and eliminated the meringue. I really don't think it adds anything to the overall end product, plus you have more filling. Also, I use Meyer lemons and eliminate the lime juice. I have never made it with any other kind of lemon. I also use miniature tartlet pans. The crust is wonderful; light, flaky and delicious. And the filling is excellent. This is one of my signature desserts.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe; however, I didn't like it. The crust is strange and mine turned into a soggy mess in the bottom, plus the meringue and filling were indistinguishable.

This was delicious...a huge hit with the women. The guys weren't as thrilled but they liked it. It took a long time to make. I made one big tart instead of mini tarts and lowered the temp to 350 and increased the cook time at the end to about 20-25 minutes. If I were to make it again I would buy the mini tart pans and make the individual portions the recipe calls for. Very good.
