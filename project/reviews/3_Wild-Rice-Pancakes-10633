These were great w/ more than a few alterations. I added the cheese as recommended by the cook from El Paso, TX and also cooked the rice in veal stock. I cut the flour slightly and upped the milk to one cup. This did make them a little hard to turn but I made them small and once they had browned on both sides they were OK. I also subbed fennel for the celery and added pistachios for crunch. I can't wait to make these in miniature and serve them as hors d'oeurves topped w/ smoked salmon!

With a few additions and a change in the flour, we found these to be delicious! I was about 1/4 cup short of wild rice, so added cooked regular rice. Added 2 tsp. concentrated vegetable base to the wild rice cooking water for extra flavor, substituted rice flour for the regular (to lighten them up a bit), a little extra milk, and a healthy cup of freshly grated pecorino romano cheese. The extra milk flattens them out a little more, making them not so dense. The cheese and vegetable base really puts the flavors over the top! Try these with the above changes, you won't be disappointed! These were gobbled up!

We love this recipe. Been making it for years. It's so good with a roast chicken.

I'm with the "it's too heavy" contingent. I chopped all the vegetables in the food processor, so the recipe was quick and easy, but the pancakes just kind of lay there on the plate. I think they need to be less doughy, more like a lace cooky. If anyone can come up with an adaptation, the flavors are good enough to warrant another try!

A very nice change from potatos, pasta or plain rice. Crunchy, nutty and terrific texture. These were terrific with sauce from the entree.

This made a wonderful main course for lunch. A light salad will balance it out nicely. I topped the pancake with quick sour cream mixture (fresh garlic and a shot of lime juice thrown into a bit of sour cream), and it blended very well with the flavors of the pancake. I'm not sure what sized carrot an earlier reviewer was using. I was able to get more than 3/4 cup of small dice from my one carrot.

Easy (once the chopping is done), but rather ordinary in flavor. Makes a nice presentation, but the egg/milk/flour required to make it into pancakes made it seem a little heavy. Personally, I prefer a lighter style rice side dish. If anyone finds it helpful, I found that the measurements equate to about 4 carrots, 4 celery stalks, 4 scallion greens and about a half a medium onion.

This was a great accompaniment to the Garlic & Rosemary Game Hens I made for Easter. I served the leftover pancakes with a garlic aioli the next day, and they were an even bigger hit. It was a great break from the usual mashed potatoes or rice pilaf. My guests were very impressed!

This was a really easy recipe to make. It was also very delicious and a big hit with my husband and co-workers.
