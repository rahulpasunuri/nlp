One of the few potato salads I've had that I've liked! Chickpeas and tarragon (I used fresh) made it interesting. I only had white round potatoes and a vidalia onion, but it still tasted great!

Really liked this and was a hit at our Easter dinner party. Just needed to add a little extra of the dressing for more flavor.
