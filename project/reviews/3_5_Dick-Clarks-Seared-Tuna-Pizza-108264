The recipe looked odd but the reviews were good so I gave it a try. I made it exactly as written with the exception of low-sodium soy sauce instead of regular. The individual components were good but the combination was not. I liked the sauce and thought it went well on the tuna. The crust was good but did not relate to the tuna and sauce. The overall effect was salt, salt, salt, (and I do love salt) and that overwhelmed the tuna. Next time I will try cutting the soy sauce with half white wine and making rice to go along with the tuna and sauce instead of pizza.

I found this pretty bland. The only saving grace was the seared ahi itself, and the sweeter sushi ginger I added on a whim at the last second. Taking into account the fact that I am indeed a beginner chef, there is always the chance that I messed it up. I'll probably try it again based on the reviews here. I followed the recipe exactly. It just wasn't that flavorful.

One of my all time favorite Bon Appetit recipes. I would have never tried this recipe if a friend hadn't raved about it. Absolutley fantastic.

Wow! I was surprised how tasty this was. I used store-bought pizza dough for a quick weeknite dinner and will definitely be making this again.

this was fantastic!!!! I would make the crust very thin and lightly brush some of the wasabi mix on the bottom of the pizza crust. I also added the sprouts, oj, and sesame seeds as suggested in another review---Fabulous!! This will become a new craving!!!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. A few suggested variations, which resulted in the best meal I've ever made! First, tear up, or grind up some nori (seaweed) and mix it into the pizza dough. You might also want to press some sesame seeds into the outer ring of the dough after it's been rolled into a circle. Second, for topping, get some Japanese radish sprouts (probably 2 or 3 packages) from an Asian market. Combine the radish sprouts with the green onions, (and maybe some finely diced red onion) add a bit of orange juice, sesame oil, sauteed crimini mushrooms, and some toasted (black)sesame seeds, and mix it all up. Add this mix to the pizza 2 or 3 minutes before the crust is completed. The result, for us, was a crispy, glazed crust, with a layer of still slightly moist greens, nicely contrasting with the succulence of the mushrooms and tuna. Enjoy!

So so so good,and is this "the" Dick Clark? I was fearful of the wasabi factor but it absolutely merits a try - I think you'll be amazed at how tasty it is. I did this as mini pizzas for a cocktail hors d' and it was a smash hit.

I have been cooking from Epicurious for years now and have never once gotten around to reviewing a recipe. This one moved me to do so. Different delicious and easy (especially if your grocer carries frozen pizza dough). Be generous when coating the dough with the sauce - definitely both sides. Low salt soy will cut down on the saltiness of the dish. Being a sushi lover I like my tuna raw at the center. I used plenty of oil on the fish and quickly seared over very high heat. Turned out perfectly. Even my teenage son, who hate all the "weird food" that his mom makes, had seconds.

Simply awesome. We loved this recipe - did the dough in my bread maker, then divided it into the 4 pieces for very generous personal size pizzas. Brushed both top and bottom of dough with the sauce - YUM. You do need to make sure you pierce the bubbles though as it says - or it's hard to get your tuna to stay put. Next time will further divide the dough to try appetizer size pizzas. Also, 5 minutes per side is way too long to cook the tuna if you like it seared as opposed to cooked through. We did more like 2 minutes per side.

Excellent to eat and easy to prepare. YUM!

34 teaspoons of salt seems like a lot - I would try 3/4 tsp salt instead.
