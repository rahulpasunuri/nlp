the only change i made to this recipe was to use fresh, frozen figs in place of the dried. i just left the water out, and the jam came out very tasty. (oh, i also just sauteed the onions... what's the point in warming up the oven?) used homemade tuscan-style bread. very good, unusual but successful combination of ingredients. i will say that prosciutto is kinda tough, especially if it's cut thicker than paper-thin. when using it as a sandwich meat, it's easy to bite into the ham and drag the whole piece of prosciutto out. in a hot sandwich like this one, that could mean trouble. so i used three pieces of paper-thin prosciutto and sort of triangle-folded them so that there weren't any long pieces in the sandwich.

this is a wonderful meal. made 3 sandwiches to make room for changes. i used ciabatta rolls, provolone on one sandwich & asiago on another...both delicious. fig spread is a bit rich & sweet...to balance that out, i put a little brown mustard on third sandwich. it turned out great & well balanced. i would be happy to serve to guest & i believe they would think it is a marvelous dish & ask for recipe. would love to serve as finger food...cut smaller sizes for party. quick & easy to make. ingredients easy to find & moderately priced.

subbed Gorgonzola cheese & it was a fantastic starter. Almost didn't need the prosciutto since gorg, port, figs and onions are such a perfect blend.

It was ok. The ingredients were expensive and it wasn't really that delicious. There are better ways to use port, prosciutto and figs. I don't think Prosciutto works well in a sandwich.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved them. They came out perfectly and were super delicious. I ended up having to double the number of onions I roasted, though, as they reduced considerably in the oven.

Interesting sandwich. Think I'll try a different cheese next time though. The overall flavor verged on being too salty.

Really delicious sandwich. I won't use any rosemary next time, though. Made as written, except used Manchego instead of Asiago.

This was very tasty and easy to make. Did most everything ahead of time and then grilled on the panini pan, cut into bite size for an open house event. People loved it.

Wow! This is an amazing sandwich. I was intrigued by the ingredients, but they truly blend beautifully to create a variety of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly (using a panini grill) and it was absolutely fabulous.
