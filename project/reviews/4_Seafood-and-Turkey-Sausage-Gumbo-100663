I've made this several times over the years and it is a week night family favorite. Usually use a white fish (whatever is fresh and in season as catfish isn't readily available).

I used crab instead of the catfish and served over rice. It was fairly spicy, which the adults enjoyed, but the kids did not. It was excellent, but not kid friendly (and I have fairly adventurous kids).

Have made this twice. First time with turkey sausage, last night with pork sausage. Both times good. Didn't have catfish so just added shrimp. Served with cornbread. Easy to make. Good flavor. Definitely a keeper.

This was a hearty and tasty gumbo - never would have guessed from the taste that it was "healthy" - will definitely make again!

Made this with 2x the sausage, left out the seafood and the bay leaf and used fresh tomatoes. Used a little sugar at the end to bring out the flavour. Got rave reviews from my pregnant wife and my four year old son... a tall order for something that I myself like!

I used less catfish and extra shrimp and I made my own cajun seasoning (recipe from this site) and doubled the amount called for. I think it's a great lower fat version of gumbo, and is now my husband's favourite. Browning the flour first is a must.

Rating: 4
I made this for the second time for Sunday dinner lastnight. Absolutely LOVE it! Browning the flour is definitely worth the effort and added a certain richness to the flavor. I love the fact that this is such a low-fat recipe. I couldn't find turkey sausage, but used smoked chicken sausage instead along with talipia because catfish wasn't readily available. I doubled the amount of shrimp used and served over brown rice. YUM! I took some for lunch today and it had the whole office smelling!

I did omit the catfish and added more shrimp. This was ok.

I have made this twice over the past few weeks. The first time, I did not tan the flour, and it was good. My 4 year old requested it again, and I wanted to make it properly, so I turned up the heat on the flour, and browned it this time. Both times I served it on a bed of rice for the kids & husband. I needed to add extra hot sauce for my own, but my kids (ages 4 & 7) and husband liked it the way it was. I will definitely make it again, but I will add okra.

You know, I wanted to like this, but I just wasn't that impressed. My boyfriend really wasn't either. Maybe I goofed somewhere, but it was a pretty easy recipe. I substiuted beef sausage for turkey in the same flavor since I could not find turkey at my local grocer. still shouldn't have made it that blah. It was ok, but nothing great. Probably won't make again

Delicious! We made two changes: we added about a cup of okra and used chicken andouille sausages instead of Italian turkey sausages. This turned out really well and we'll definitely make it again.

We loved this! We added sliced gumbo to the pepper/onions, and we added an extra teaspoon of Old Bay & an extra cup of broth since we served it over rice. Also used andouille from Whole Foods. Delicious! This would be great for a group!

Compare this recipe with others on epicurious and create your own version. I like to include seafood (catfish, cod, shrimp, etc.) as well as chicken thighs and turkey sausage to make a fuller-bodied flavor. I find it's definitely worth it to make the Roux, helps thicken the gumbo and adds flavor to overcome the heavy tomato flavor. Also, remember that the longer this cooks, the more the spices blend together - it's always better on days 2 and 3. If you're an okra-lover, throw some whole pieces in as well. This is a hit with everyone!

Rating: 3
This was easy and yummy. We made it in a crock pot. In addition to the listed ingredients we added the okra, celery and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. We browned the flour in a pan and pre-sauteed some okra, then threw all ingredients into the crock pot. We used andouille turkey sausage.

Cooked this recipe for the first time last night for tonight's dinner. It was absolutely delicious. My kids ate two bowls each. My husband ate a bowl for breakfast and then another for dinner. The recipe was quite simple. I used red and yellow bellpeppers instead of green. I also used chicken chorizo sausage from Trader Joe's instead of the italian turkey. I used italian herbs since I didn't have dried thyme or a bay leaf. And finally I used Old Bay seasoning for the creole/cajun seasoning. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
This was SO good! The browning flour idea is genius! My Whole Foods had chicken andouille, so I used that instead of the italian sausage, which I think did a lot for the depth of the dish.

Rating: 4
Solid dish, sure crowd pleaser. I am not too sure it is possible to get the sausage "browned" with out burning up the remnants of the flour on the bottom of the pan. All in all this was worth the time and effort and a nice recipe for your arsenal. **I added celery (1/2 cup)- just seemed unnatural with out it.

Rating: 4
I like gumbo but have always been turned off by the huge amount of oil required for the roux. This method is a great alternative and does not compromise the flavor. I've made it twice now and my husband hangs around the pot the whole time, salivating. The first time I made sure to put in celery (after all, what's gumbo without the Holy Trinity?) and the second time we did not since the hubbie hates it, but I don't think we'll do that again. You can't take out both the roux and the Holy Trinity and expect to call it gumbo, after all! We used sausage and chicken in our pot. For the sausage, we browned little rounds of them in a separate pan, took out the sausage and drained them on paper towels. Then I took a tbsp of the sausage fat and use that to cook the onions and bell peppers instead. A little pork fat makes everything better! Lastly, we used a Creole seasoning I bought when visiting New Orleans, called Tony Cacheres Original Creole seasoning. At less than $2, it's cheap, and it's great with everything, kinda like Old Bay. Just watch how much you put in there since it contains salt.

So good! I used the italian chicken sausage instead. The catfish was my favorite part- perfectly tender. The tomatoes were great and added a nice little burst of flavor.

Rating: 3
I gave this 3.5 stars; even though I really liked the end result, as written I personally thought it would have been overwhelmed by tomatoes and it needed more spice and herbs to perk up the flavor.. Roasting the flour is a great trick to give dishes depth without the fat usually added by making gumbo with roux, as its traditionally made. You can roast a double or triple batch and keep in an air-tight container for at month or so. I used only a 14 oz. can of fire-roasted organic tomatoes, and added some extra stock. This was great; any more would have been too much like tomato soup. I put the shells from the shrimp into the stock and simmered it for a bit before straining and then adding as directed -- it gave it a bit more flavor. I added celery with the onion and pepper, and added diced okra at the end, along with some cayenne pepper, dried thyme and a bay leaf. I didn't add fish, and didn't miss it. I used fresh chicken andouille from my supermarket and it gave it a nice kick..Served with white rice, I thought it was tasty and quick, and will definitely make it again. If you want to cut down on salt, Mrs. Dash makes a good spicy blend that would work well in this.

This recipe is great! I was a novice at making gumbo and it worked out really well. I substituted tilapia as well as used a pork sausage and the results were wonderful. I served this on a cold February night in Toronto for a small dinner party and it certainly warmed the soul a little! It's a definite keeper.

This recipe is in regular rotation in my chicken--it's fast and healthy, and stores well (so I can bring leftovers for lunch). I made just a few changes: red and yellow peppers instead of green ones, 8 ounces of bay scallops and 4 ounces of small shrimp instead of the large shrimp and catfish...and I added 1 lb of okra. I also used 2 sausages instead of 3--and that was more then enough. Overall, I love this recipe, and I use it often

Delicious - 3.5 stars. I quadrupled the recipe for a gumbo party and added celery and crawfish (skipped the catfish) as past reviewers recommended. Browning the flour took almost 40 minutes though.

I increased veggies to 1 bell pepper, 1 med-lrg onion, 3 celery stalks (chopped fine in food processor to make kid friendly), decreased tomato to 14 oz can diced, increased stock to approx 5 cups. I also used andouille sausage which fell apart during sauteeing (it's low fat too). It's really, really good. The best gumbo i've made.

Rating: 2
Easy enough gumbo-like recipe, but I didn't particularly like the use of the turkey sausage. The Italian spices didn't mix well with Cajun/Creole. If I were to make this again I would use turkey kielbasa, or smoked sausage. I doubled the recipe but only used a 15oz. can of fire-roasted tomatoes. The roux should be the more prominent taste than tomato. I always add a little oregano, tobasco, and worcestershire, and of course chopped celery to my gumbo recipes. Used scallops in place of catfish. I prefer the Gumbo-laya recipe, also on this site, but add the brown flour roux step to it.

Rating: 2
I found this gumbo to be a bit too tomato-y. It smelled great and tasted alright, but I would rather have the full fat gumbo and run it off later. I did appreciate the one-pot routine.

Rating: 3
Really- very, very good. I quadrupled the recipe, as I was making food for 18 for my annual Mardi Gras party- For the last four years I've made the Gumbo-Laya on this site with any number of tinkerings, but because of vegetarians present on this particular occasion, I felt the need to separate rice from gumbo. Browning the flour is not a big deal; as Vegas review stated, shake the pan and pay attention to it now and then- it works- the darker the better (sans burning). Do the catfish if you can- I also did shrimp and bay scallops. I seemed to notice that many guests, upon tasting the gumbo, were somewhat slack-jawed (a departure from their normal existence).

Terrific recipe. Didn't need to add any shrimps but added some carrots, broccoli stems, mushrooms and corn. It's so delicious! Definitely a keeper.

A great dinner! Followed recipe but added 1/2 fresh jalapeno, a couple of chopped celery stalks, and some frozen chopped okra at the end with the fish. Served over jasmine rice. And you don't have to stir the flour for 15 mins. Just shake the pan every now and then and watch so it doesn't burn.

Yummy! Have made this before following the original recipe and it was great. This time I used 1# of spicy turkey sausage and 1# of shrimp, added celery and used 2 cans of chicken broth...No fish... I also added a can of garbanzo beans (I was trying to duplicate another recipe). I actually liked this better! The flour does take more than 15 minutes to brown...but well worth it!

This was a great dish served over rice cooked in chicken broth and some of the cooking liquid. I didn't have turkey sausage so I used regular and only had catfish. I added celery as others have suggested and used 4 sausage links, so i added more chicken broth (1 whole 14.5 oz can). I also used a little more cajun seasoning -- scant one tablespoon. Was so delicious!

Easy to prepare and open to substitution. Used mild italian sausage, side stripes, and scallops, lots of fresh oregano and thyme from the garden. Served with a big pot of rice and thought I made lots, but everyone had seconds. Definitely a keeper.

Used vegetable oil/butter mixture to make the roux and added celery. The recipe doubled fine, but the results seemed too tomato-y, even though the tomato portion wasn't doubled. Along with the seasonings in the Italian turkey sausage, it had a pasta sauce character. Everyone loved it, but I will cut down on the tomato next time.

This was very tasty and even better the next day. I skipped the catfish and doubled up on the shrimp.

This was great! And all the reviews are right, you can't tell this is a low-fat version. I really liked the fish in it, but my husband was only so-so on that ingredient. Han's All-Natural makes a fantastic chicken andouille sausage that adds great flavor to this. Like others, I did add celery (what's gumbo without the trinity :)? ) but otherwise, no changes.

Wow, this gumbo is amazing! Just made it for our Mardi Gras celebration tonight. You will never know it is a lower fat version of a traditional gumbo, made with a full fat roux. My only changes were adding celery and some chopped crawfish tails. Unbelievably excellent!

I'm not going to rate this recipe as is because I feel I've made too many changes. This recipe is a great starting place for an even better gumbo. I added red bell pepper, jalapenos, celery, okra, tabasco and worchestershire (sp?). I also used 2/3 turkey-sausage and 1/3 andouille. The result was most definitely 4 forks. I served it with jasmine rice mixed with scallions and parsley. Outstanding!!

Loved the ease of this recipe. So many other gumbo recipes involve multiple pots! This one was almost a "one skillet method". Aside from seasoning my shrimp with old bay before adding them, I didn't change a thing.

Rating: 3
Great flavor without the added fat! I live in Chicago, so I definitely used the catfish fillets. I also used shrimp, and andouille turkey sausage. The kids loved it and my husband who is not a big seafood fan ate two helpings! We had enough for the four of us with leftovers for the next day. I served this over seasoned rice (chicken stock and cajon seasoning), and corn muffins.

This recipe is easy and excellent. I made a traditional roux with 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of flour, and simmered it on medium low until it was a very rich dark brown. Added it back in towards the end of cooking. Increases the fat content some but it was amazing. Also added okra and crawfish tails... Very Very good!

Rating: 4
I've been making gumbo for 20 years, and this roux is the BEST I've ever had! I agree with the other cooks in that the key is to get the flour nice and toasty brown -- it adds so much depth and flavor. I doubled the amount of flour to 1/2 cup (I doubled the recipe). It took me about 35 minutes to get the flour the way I like it but not burn it. I made changes: (1) I used the traditional trinity of onions, celery and bell pepper; (2) seared boneless, skinless chicken thighs and removed from the pan; (3) added lowfat duck/turkey sausage and the vegetables to the brown bits in the pan; (4)added back the chicken w/the browned flour w/some chicken stock. I also added some hot sauce and worcestershire sauce after simmering. I didn't use catfish, but added a pound of shrimp after slowly simmering for an hour. Serve with white rice and garnish with parsley and a bit of green onion.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. My husband worships me. I doubled the recipe. Doubled everything except the catfish--substituted 12 oz scallops, and i used 5 tablespoons of Emeril's Original Essence (couldn't find cajun or creole seasoning). Used 3 turkey hot Italian sausages, and 3 pork andoulli sausages. Served it over brown rice for the superbowl. It is so rich, has such a nice flavor. The flavor of the seafood permeates the broth. Delish.

Quite delicious, though I needed to kick in more spice to get it to where it felt like the Gumbo's I've had in New Orleans. All in all, though, it's easy to make and great for a cold winter's night.

Tasty dish, easy and fast to make. Some substitutions on my next 'go around' will be (1) using Johnsonville Beer & Bratwurst sausage (awesome sweet beer taste), and (2) a bit more garlic. I liked this dish because you really have room to substitute to your liking (I'm not a big fan of catfish, so I didn't include it), and we have plenty of leftover!!

This recipe was superb and so easy too! Instead of the turkey sausage, I used andouille mini sausages. I used a can of chicken broth and seasoned it with Emeril's Essence.

This recipe is amazing. I really adore it! Delicious gumbo, with that smoky-spicy flavor, but remarkably healthy, too. It's very important to get that flour brown enough; that's what makes or breaks this, in my opinion. I made the recipe exactly as it was, except for slicing my turkey sausage diagonally instead of letting it crumble.

After two years of using this site, this is my first submission. I LOVED this recipe. Browning the flour was definately worth the effort; I admit that I used smoked sausage for 2/3 of the amount of sausage and tossed in a bit more cajun seasoning, but other than that I followed the directions exactly.

Excellent dish that is full of flavor. You wouldn't realize it is lower fat. This was made for a Mardi Gras party with adults and children so I doubled the recipe right off the bat. I left out the catfish and doubled the turkey sausages and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Nobody complained about it being to spicy (even the wimps who say they don't like hot food) and for those of us who love hot food I left some cayenne pepper and tobasco on the table. Everyone loved it and not a drop was left. I gave out several copies of the recipe. Even my biggest food critic (my husband) asked when I was making it again. This one goes into my "Epicurious" folder.

I agree with the previous reviewer -- it needed a lot of help. I added celery and red bell pepper to the onions and bell pepper mixture, used Louisiana Hot sausage, added 1/4 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. cayenne, and 2 tsp. paprika (in addition to double the amount of Cajun seasoning), added freshly ground pepper, and added some clam juice. Finally, I omitted the flour step altogether since we have a child with wheat sensitivity -- I thickened the gumbo at the very end with rice flour -- which I personally think is a better substitute for any dish which calls for flour as a thickening agent since it doesn't clump up.

Rating: 3
This recipe is ok; I might try it again. But, if I do, I will really kick up that cajun spice amount--probably double. The flavor was bland and I found it no more interesting than boiled food with a bit of tomato. I used chicken instead of catfish and used oysters instead of shrimp. I also added okra. However, I doubt this absorbed so much more spice than the catfish would have. I recommend that you taste and then adjust, then simmer longer to let the flavors seep in.

I really enjoy this dish. I have made it about 4-5 times now. My family enjoy it also. I made this exactly following the recipe and making additions and changes of my own.

You can't beat the simplicity of this recipe, and the excellent results. I was trying to use what I had in the kitchen so mine had no shrimp - more catfish, no bell pepper - anaheim's instead. I had to use regular chicken broth and it was too salty - definitely stick with the low-sodium, or make your own broth without salt (the sausage adds enough). We loved it anyway... served it over rice. I'm making it again using several different kinds of fish. I think just about anything would taste great in there!! Enjoy!!

I deleted the catfish, and used 5 sausages instead, and also added chopped celery, zucchini and some fresh corn.

I also pre-marinaded the shrimp in a cajun marinade for about 15 minutes.

I made this for a Mardi Gras party & everyone loved it. It's very flavorful for a lowfat meal and tastes wonderful over rice. I used those Mrs. Paul's fish filets (not breaded) for the fish and added Cayenne pepper for extra kick.

This was easy and delicious. We really enjoyed and will make it again soon for company. Its great just the way it is.

I thought gumbo, by definition, had to have okra in it.

Excellent, easy and good for you. One of the best recipes on the site - make with the spicy rice with kale.

I substituted carrots and celery for the green pepper I didn't have at the time and, diced a left over ham slice instead of the shrimp and fish. Be careful with the cajun seasoning unless you want to clear your sinuses. It's a good recipe.

THIS WAS EXCELLENT!! I'VE MADE THIS AT LEAST SIX TIMES ALREADY! MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WHO IS A GREAT COOK LOVED IT AND HAS MADE IT A FEW TIMES TOO! BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPICY, USE HALF AS MUCH CAJUN SPICES.

Excellent recipe! I've made it a couple of times, and it has turned out great both times. I did add back the browned flour when I added the fish and shrimp and it thickened up nicely.

I got this recipe in Bon Apetit and made it for my family. Even my kids (who are reluctant to try anything more adventurous than pepperoni pizza) loved it!

I loved the receipe and I made it with catfish. Served it with the spicy rice and kale recipe that was in the article. How can you not like catfish???

Yum! I skipped the fish and instead doubled the shrimp. I also added a couple of splashes of hot sauce and a can of sliced okra,thoroughly drained. I served it over rice, and it was a big hit. While not as thick or rich as most gumbos, it still packed a lot of flavor for a "light" dish.

Very good; didn't taste "low fat." I added chopped red bell pepper, extra shrimp and fish (not catfish), and served over white rice. Everyone went back for seconds!

Very good but I found the Catfish much too "fishy." Used Cod instead.

Yes, they forgot to specify using the flour to thicken the sauce as necessary. In any case, it makes a very light and tasty gumbo.

Is it just me or do all you fancy cooks just KNOW what to do with the browned flour left sitting in the bowl? Is it for looks or what!? Really thought you'd have better proof readers for such a la-tee-da-hoity-toidy magazine!!
