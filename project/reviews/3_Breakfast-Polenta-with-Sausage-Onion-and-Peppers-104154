A little disappointing. The sausage mixture was flavorful & spicy but the polenta itself was bland & didn't hold together. I wanted to serve the scrambled eggs with cream cheese & chives over the crisp polenta but had to scrap that idea and serve them alongside. Polenta has to be cooked a long time to be thick enough to stick together for this type of application. I will try again but may keep the polenta seperate and scramble eggs with the sausage to serve over. Since I think polenta is northern Italian & I don't care for oregano I think sage might be a nice flavor. I also prefer red to green bell peppers & this dish could use the color they would provide.

A bit bland for our tastes. Needed to add some spice or tabasco.

My family and friends have enjoyed this recipe time and time again. Not only is it good for breakfast, but with pasillas or poblanos instead of the bell pepper, the flavor lends itself to a delicious appetizer.
