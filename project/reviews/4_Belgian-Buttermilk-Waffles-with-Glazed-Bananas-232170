I was so ready to love these waffles, but the texture was terrible! Way too soft--I had to peel them out of the waffle iron. They tasted good, but waffles are 90% texture. I did separate the eggs and make them in a belgian iron, so that may have been the downfall. Definitely won't be making these again.

Great waffle recipe! So crisp on the outside and so light. It can work as a base for whatever toppings you want. I halved the recipe and it yielded 3 waffles, perfect for just the two of us. Added fresh banana and candied pecans. Real maple syrup on top and it was amazing. Also used buttermilk sub (whole milk + vinegar) and it was fine. Will bookmark this one.

GREAT flavor, perfect consistency, comes out great every time. If you make it just like it says, you will have a great waffle. ONLY watch on portions, a true Belgium waffle will make only 4ish not 8 of these.

Very good, we added an 1/8 tspn of vanilla and had to add about a 1/2 cup more buttermilk as it was to thick to pour. But it was excellent probably have had a few waffles that were better but this was crispy crust but not a heavy crust and very tasty. Cooked it on a setting of 4 on our Waring Pro.

I have been making waffles for Christmas breakfast every year. Usually we like them because they're smothered in strawberries and cream, because otherwise they were kind of stiff and dry. Not these! Loved them! Sweet and tender! Delicious with the bananas or with any other topping.

Good but I found the butter hardened again on contact with the cold batter (milk was cold). I would try it again with vegetable oil.

Not bad at all. I was out of waffle mix this morning so I gave it a try. I added a bit of vanilla extract and a tsp of cinnamon, and reduced the butter to 4 tsp. Came out perfectly.

I have made these before but not for a while. They are amazing. Added a little vanilla and kids went wild. Make sure to keep them warm in oven to keep them crisp on outside until read to serve and barely mix wet and dry together so they are light and fluffy inside. Yum!

Rating: 4
I made the recipe as-is the first time, and the waffles turned out very well, not dense like other recipes that I have tried. For subsequent efforts, I cut the butter to 4 Tbsp and still was able to achieve light and airy waffles. For my kids, I sprinkle mini chocolate chips onto the batter after spreading it out on the waffle iron. I have not made the banana topping because I think the recipe is sweet enough, especially with the chocolate chips.

This one is going into my "only the most amazing recipes in here" notebook! My kids gobbled them up. I added a dash of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and vanilla to the wet. So yummy! I did them on a regular (not Belgian) waffle iron. Crunchy on the outside, fluffy and light on the inside. We didn't do the bananas but put syrup and cinnamon sugar sprinkled on the outside... would be good with Nutella as well (my fav).

My first time making waffles from scratch, and these were a tasty & quick choice! I did not have buttermilk, so I used 2 cups of skim milk & a dollop of greek yogurt - you can also use vinegar or lemon juice with milk as a substitute for buttermilk. As many other reviewers did, I added a splash of vanilla to sweeten the batter a little. Did not make the bananas, but this is a great waffle recipe on its own. Yum!

Best waffles ever, and couldn't be easier to make! I had previously only used the recipes that came with my Belgian waffle maker, but this is definitely my new standard. I've made these twice this week and they have been a hit with everyone. I highly recommend making the bananas too and serving with homemade whipped cream, it really makes them taste incredibly decadent. These are a perfect blend of crispy on the outside and a bit cake-like on the inside.

Wow, probably the best waffles I have ever had (I didn't make this recipe's topping, just the waffles). Don't let the simplicity of the recipe fool you. I made them in a regular (non-Belgian) waffle maker. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and not too sweet. For extra protein, I added 1/4 cup of ground almond meal. YUM.

I finally made waffles after getting a Belgian waffle iron for my birthday. The batter was okay (i have my own buttermilk pancake mix) I cooked the entire batter and froze what we did not eat. I followed the recipe except I did not make the glaze. I just was not feeling like bananas at the moment. But will try in the future. Leftovers OMG warmed in the oven at 250 for about 10-15 minutes were even BETTER! Next time when I make them fresh I will warm them in the oven and see if they come out crispier that way.

Finally tried these today and liked the waffles very much. Will regularly warm our maple syrup from now on, that was a nice touch. Didn't especially care for the sauteed bananas; they were too sweet for my taste. Made a second batch of waffles to freeze for next weekend.

I think I may never use Krusteaz or Bisquick for waffles again! This produced a light, non-cakey waffle. I am quite the fan of this recipe. I haven't made the glazed bananas but I'm sure that will go well with it as well. Honestly, the waffle itself is treat enough.

Simple, easy recipe that makes great waffles. My waffle iron needed a little over 1 cup of batter to fill up the iron, so I made only 4 waffles. I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to add a bit of flavor.

We just made these waffles as our latest breakfast-for-dinner. Given that my partner is pretty unimaginative regarding bruch fare, I eat a lot of crummy waffles. These waffles however, praise griddle, are so crispy and fluffy, not even a hit of gummy torture. They are so perfect, I actually wrote a review. I can't comment on the bananas... and at this rate I doubt I will ever change a thing!

Rating: 4
Wow! Fabulous! Served 4 adults at our 4th of July breakfast today. Everyone raved about it. Whisk the dry ingredients early (day before or early am to save time). I bought yellow/green bananas yesterday which were perfect today. Can see why they could get mushy. Add a dollop of whipped cream to top. Don't change anything. Exquisite. (A little labor intensive but worth the raves you'll get). Serve with bacon, fresh fruit & mimosas.

Probably one of the best waffle recipes I've made. I've been on the hunt for the light, soft & crispy waffles, and keep getting lead heavy ones. These were light and wonderful. I didn't quite get the crisp I wanted, but maybe I just didn't leave them in long enough... The fried bananas are decadent, make sure you use not quite ripe ones, or they get too mushy. Made this for my husband for fathers day and they were a hit. My only sub was using yogurt instead of buttermilk, as that's what I had on hand.

I don't know what I did wrong but my waffles turned out kind of spongy or rubbery. They tasted fine - maybe a bit eggy so perhaps I should have used small eggs instead of large? Any advice would be appreciated.

I missing some ingredients, had to make a few changes, and it was still fantastic. I halved the recipe (because I had little buttermilk) and therefore used 3/4 cup buttermilk + 1/4 cup half-and-half + an extra Tbsp of melted butter. Also I was out of all purpose flour so used 2/3 cup cake flour + 1/3 cup white wheat flour. Waffles were amaaaayzing.

I made just the waffles (not the topping) as I took these in to work for a team treat. Brought in the wet & dry ingredients separately (each already mixed in its own bowl), then combined at work. Also brought in my waffle iron and made one after another. These were incredibly tasty and they smell to die for. In my case I dropped in some frozen blueberries and served them with maple syrup but will try the banana topping at home next time.

Great recipe! I changed the Directions using the recipe of the Classic Belgian Waffles by Emeril Lagasse. The waffles were amazing! Directions as follows: Preheat the waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. In 1 medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In a second bowl use the wooden spoon to beat together the egg yolks and sugar until sugar is completely dissolved and eggs have turned a pale yellow. Add the vanilla extract, melted butter, and milk to the eggs and whisk to combine. Combine the egg-milk mixture with the flour mixture and whisk just until blended. Do not over mix. In third bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Using the rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the waffle batter. Do not overmix! Coat the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and pour enough batter in iron to just cover waffle grid. Close and cook as per manufacturer's instructions until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

I agree with other reviewers that the waffles are "eggy" tasting. I am hoping that the leftovers which were placed in the freezer will crunch up in the toaster. They were a bit rubbery. Sorry.

Love this recipe. We used to use a whole wheat mix from Whole Foods, but it's been recently discontinued. I've searched endlessly for a recipe to replicate the mix. I just add a cup of WW flour instead of White Flour to get the extra benefits, but otherwise, this recipe is perfect. It also tastes great with lemon extract and dried blueberries!

Rating: 4
With or without the bananna topping, an all around excellant waffle. I add vanilla extract and pecans to the batter and top with a sprinkle of powder sugar. Just to die for good. Kept in a warming tray so serving a large quantity was no problem but do store on a single layer to prevent getting soggy!!!

Although I have not tried the maple bananas, the waffles are delicious made exactly as the recipe indicates. I make double batches so that I can freeze the extras for later (individually double wrapped), to be reheated in a 350 degree oven until crisp. I have the All-Clad 4-waffle belgian waffle maker and this recipe does indeed make 8 waffle squares. I also find it helpful to use kitchen shears to cut the waffles apart when needed.

Just a note to my previous review -- I reduced the butter/oil to 4 Tbs (3 butter/1 oil) and didn't notice a thing.

This is an excellent recipe, even after i messed around with it. Instead of 2 C flour, I used: 1 C all purpose flour + 2/3 C spelt flour (Bob's) + 1/3 C ground flax seed. I dropped the butter to 4 Tbs, and added 2 Tbs DHA/omega 3 canola oil. Finally, I used more salt than the recipe called for, and 1% milkfat buttermilk. The end result couldn't be eaten fast enough. Next time I'll have to double the recipe to have some to freeze. I'm considering replacing the egg with Eggbeaters next time, just to reduce the fat content a little.

My belgian waffle maker broke in the middle of cooking our first waffle, but our almost-cooked waffle was still delicious. I then added about 3/4 cup buttermilk to the rest of the batter to thin it out and made pancakes. It's now a favorite at our house!! I also added chopped up banana directly to the batter. My kids ask for it all the time.

I couldn't ask for better or easier Belgian waffles and the sauce is very tasty too. The bananas impart a great flavor to the maple syrup. Keep in mind though, like another reviewer stated, that the bananas quickly turn to mush if overcooked.

I made these with a regular waffle iron (made 5 waffles), which perhaps wasn't the best idea. They came out fairly soggy and floppy, even after warming them in the oven. My waffle iron isn't the best, but I've definitely gotten better results with other recipes. The taste was nice, a little eggy as others say, but I don't think I'd make them again. The banana topping, on the other hand, was delicious--I briefly sauteed some sliced strawberries after taking out the bananas but before putting the syrup in.

I just made these waffles, and this recipe is without a doubt a lifetime keeper. I followed the recipe as is with the only exception of substituting the AP flour with 50/50 white/wheat flour. To note, I halved the recipe thinking it would make 4 belgium waffles - but I only got 2. Light, a little crispy crust, delicious!

This waffle recipe is very similar to an old southern buttermilk pancake recipe I have been using for years. Exceptional. Best waffles I've had... bar none.

This is the recipe i had dreamt of when I purchased my waffle iron. I just do the waffles and generally make fresh whipped cream for topping with fresh berries. I have been making these for a year now, often for friends who come for brunch and they are perfect. I also add flax seed , so they come out speckled and my kids are none the wiser that I have tricked them into consuming fiber and omega 3's. Ha!

This is the family's standard for waffles. They simply won't allow any other waffle to be made. I do mix different flours and add a small amt. of ground oat meal to give a bit more substance but man oh man, love me some of these. Don't over cook the bananas though. Just a quick dunk in the skillet; otherwise you have mush. Use really REALLY firm bananas to begin with. I let my batter sit as well so it has time to rise and these are so light and fluffy you just can't stop eating them.

This is the recipe I've been looking for-quick and delicious! Waffles are lightly crispy,airy on the inside and not too filling. Added 2 TBS brown sugar to the butter before putting in the bananas. Only tip would be to make sure you don't overcook the bananas. The one minute per side is just right. Would probably need at least 2 more bananas if you were serving eight people, though.

Tasted good but not crispy enough for me. I swapped 2/3 cup whole wheat flour for white. I was pretty careful to gently combine the dry and wet ingredients and not mix too much, but I felt these were still a tad bit tough.

This is the best waffle recipe. My only change is that I use 2 cups of greek yogurt instead of the buttermilk to make uber fluffy waffles. You do have to use less batter per waffle or it squeezes out of the press. I add a little bit of milk if the consistency is too thick. Delicious.

So wonderful as a special breakfast for Father's Day. The waffles were quite fluffy and the banana-maple syrup added a nice flavor.

This is our go-to waffle recipe for a number of different reasons: you don't need any special ingredients (I use buttermilk powder with the dry ingredients and add the corresponding amount of water to the wet ingredients), you don't have to whip the egg whites, and they taste great! My kids love our waffle dinners, and we add that precooked bacon to the waffles. The salty sweetness is perfect. I tried the "original" belgian waffle recipe with yeast posted earlier in the reviews, and they didn't even begin to measure up (they were very heavy). Try this one.

This is probably the best waffle recipe i've used, light but full at once. The only adjustment i made was to use one cup of whole wheat and one cup all- purpose. It doesn't change the taste and it's much healthier. I find it too much with 2 cups whole weat but 1 and 1 is just perfect.

These were very easy and turned out beautifully. They were the first recipe I've made with my new waffle maker, so I can't compare them except they seemed much thicker than other waffles I've had.

This is now my standard waffle recipe. I haven't tried the bananas, but whenever we want waffles we use this recipe because it's quick to whip up.

I'm still searching for the "One True Waffle Recipe" but until I find it, this one is a good, basic recipe!

My French-Moroccan boyfriend requested waffles for breakfast one Sunday, so I scoured the Web and settled on this recipe. Am I glad I did! He loved the fluffy waffles and buttery banana topping... so much so, he actually called his mother in France to tell her about the amazing waffles his American girlfriend made for him.

good, quick waffles. Substituted non-fat yogurt for the buttermilk which worked perfectly for consistency and taste. Straight from the waffle iron, my waffles were not as crispy as I like them. Warming them in the oven or reheating gave them the needed crispiness. Also subsituted white whole wheat flour - I enjoy the taste of WW flour but could see how most would prefer the AP flour in the waffles. Excellent served with a citrus/bannana fruit salad.

I like this recipe a lot better than the ones which came with my waffle maker. It has become my favourite Saturday breakfast. We have a family tradition of a 'special breakfast' on Saturdays. I cooked bananas to serve with the waffles but didn't use maple syrup because of the expense. Instead I have tried a couple of things, both of which worked well. I used a tangy apple syrup once, and last time I used freshly-squeezed orange juice with honey mixed in.

These are very good but...Guess What? For all of you 1964 World's Fair Belgian waffle seekers, real Belgian waffles (as they are made in Belgium) are made with yeast. That's why nobody can get the taste/texture exactly right. The recipe that I have is: bloom 1tsp of dry active yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar. Meanwhile combine room temp or warm water(1C) and milk(1C) with 3 beaten eggs, 2/3C of sugar, 1/2C of butter(1stick), 1/2tsp of salt and a 1tsp of vanilla extract. Whisk everything together till smooth then add the bloomed yeast mixture. Then whisk in 3C of A/P flour till smooth and let sit 1 hour in a warm place(your kitchen). You can add lemon, orange zest and/or cinnamon with the flour if you like. After 1 hour, make the waffles anf you will have the meal you remember!

I have classic Belgian recipes that use yeast that are fabulous...but a little time consuming. This recipe is quick and produces light, tender and tasty waffles. Belgian waffles are a weekend ritual for us and everyone raves about this recipe. Because this recipe is so quick, I've even made these during the week before sending the kids off to school. Enjoy!

Did this without the bananas, but was still very good.

Was looking for a recipe for buttermilk waffles since I had some fresh buttermilk and also a Belgian waffle maker. However, my husband is allergic to bananas so ommitted that part. They were so easy to make and very light, fluffy and moist. Will definitely make them again and experiment with vanilla, cinnamon etc.

We just got a professional belgian waffle maker for xmas. This recipe worked well - nothing fancy but the taste was good!

I've tried a lot of waffle recipes and this is my favourite so far. The waffles come out fluffy and moist, and the batter spreads well in the waffle iron.

I have been making these for 6 months now and really love the taste and texture. Sometimes I add a little cinnamon. I make a batch ahead of time, cool on wire racks, and freeze. They reheat nicely in a toaster oven and never loose their taste or texture. Everyone I have made them for raves about them. A great recipe coupled with my favorite waffle iron (Villa Ware)creates a perfect waffle.
