These cookies are a good basic recipe, not too fussy. A little on the sweet side- next time I'd either reduce the sugar or use dark chocolate to counteract the sweetness of the cookie. I recommend mixing some canola oil in with the chocolate to thin it out and keep the dipping process easier.

I'm not sure what went wrong, but these cookies went completely flat. I even tried freezing them and that didn't work either. I also tried to dip them in chocolate but were so flaky they fell apart in the chocolate. Although they weren't visually appealing, the basic cookie was very good.

I've made chocolate dipped shortbread cookies before but this year couldn't find the recipe due to a move and used this one. The dough is too crumbly to work with.

Very easy and very tasty. My cookies were a lovely, light texture and the quantity of melted chocolate was just right. Be sure not to roll them any thinner than 1/4 inch!

I was pleased with the end result. I did not have premium vanilla or chocolate but was surprised at how well the cookies turned out.

These are more sugar cookies than shortbread. They taste super but slightly less sugar would make them just right.

These are like grown-up sugar cookies. They're pretty quick to make; I think I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion and roll them into balls and flatten next time since they were a bit crumbly.

I made these again. As the butter wasn't at room temperature, I beat the butter with the sugar much more until the mixture was light and fluffy... They flew off the plates!

This is great! I made them for a book club at church and received a lot of compliments from about 15 women, many of them strong cooks and bakers. It means it when it says to have the butter at room temperature. I thought I had a fiasco but it sat for a bit and then it was much better.

Yum! I'm making these for a party tomorrow--I haven't dipped them in the chocolate yet, but I just took the cookies out of the oven and they are SO delicious! I already have rave reviews from my roommate. The one change I made was to add the zest of one lemon to the dough--I think it gives it a nice flavor.

One of the best shortbread cookies around. I chilled the cookies for the first batch and skipped that step for the second batch... No noticebale difference! Does anyone know what that's all about??

A wonderful cookie with or without the chocolate. When there's no time for dipping in chocolate, I simply press the face of the cookie in sugar before baking. These cookies are always a hit either way.

Very easy. The chocolate-dipping is a bit time-consuming but worth it. These cookies are a huge hit with coworkers and family. The shortbread is good even without the chocolate, too.

Super, super easy recipe. I made it even easier by shaping balls out of the dough, then flattening into discs. Sprinkled some with colored sugar, reserved others for melted chocolate.

I made these for Valentines Day using fluted heart cookie cutters and what a success! They were described as "heaven on earth". Even a guy said they were light and buttery. I will most happily place them in my keeper file. Thanks once again Epicurious!

Good and easy to make, it just takes a while to dip in chocolate and cool. I turned the over to 350 and needed to cook for about 25 minutes to get that golden brown color I like in shortbread. I think if I make it again I'll add some lemon or orange peel to the shortbread to give it a bit of extra flavor.

I made all the cookies from Epicurious' holiday cookie feature. These flew off the platter the fastests and had the most requests for the recipe. I sprinkled the ends with holiday colored jimmies when the chocolate was still wet. I also found the paint brush I use for royal icing came in handy to help distribute the chocolate after dipping. YUMMY! Happy Holidays.
