I made this for a dinner party I threw and it was a success! My guests scarfed it down... I decided to serve it with a vanilla bean gelato and it made the sauce even better- the combination of the hot and cold was perfect! And the biscuits soaked up the gelato so nicely. I will definitely be making this again in the future.

This dish was delicious! I used 3 cups of all-purpose flour rather than the cake flour and skim milk instead of buttermilk for the shortcakes. For the pears, I used Bartlett pears and regular brandy. Very easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser.

I prepared this for a dinner party, and every guest asked for the recipe. It was a perfect ending to an autumn evening meal. I used a pear liqueur called Perle de Brillet and it gave the sauce a very rounded soft flavor. I also used a leaf-shaped cookie cutter for the shortcakes.

I made this last Christmas for a luncheon dessert. It went over extremely well.

I made this for a Sunday brunch and it was very good--the shortcakes have a wonderful texture and work very well with the sauce. Next time I'll make sure my pears are very good quality, and I'll use less brandy--it overpowered the dish. But we still enjoyed it very much.
