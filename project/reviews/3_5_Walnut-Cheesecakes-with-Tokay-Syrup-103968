Very good. I made it several times and will make it again... I usually put little round piece of parchment paper on the bottom which makes it easier to unmold the cakes.

This is very similar to a dessert that my Hungarian grandmother makes for birthdays and Christmas dinner. It's amazingly delicious and goes very well with wintery kinds of food.
