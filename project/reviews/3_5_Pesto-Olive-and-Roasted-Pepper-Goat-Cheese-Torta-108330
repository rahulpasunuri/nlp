This recipe is amazing! Have made it several times, and my guests always love it. I do half goat cheese and half cream cheese also. Pesto, red pepper and olive tapenade are all perfect in this! I serve it with crostini (baguette sliced, brushed with 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter with S&P, baked at 400 until golden) Yum!

Great to add to the hors d'oeurve platter - made the red layer by combining sundried tomatoes and jarred red peppers whirled together in the food processor to give it a little more bite. Also did the pesto layer by making my own and just leaving out the oil - worked great.

I served this at an open house/book signing at my store and everyone clamored for the recipe. I will chill between layers next time for easier spreading. Time-consuming but well worth the effort.

I make this quite a lot since it is so easy to put together.I usually halve teh recipe since it makes so much. It is always a big hit...I've also used sundried tomotoes chopped finely in place of the red peppers. Yes, do use half cream cheese!

agreed with splitting cream cheese and goat. I think olives are essential to this. Consider mashing up the peppers.

To begin with, drop the olive tapenade. This is a great recipe without it. Drop a handful of toasted pine nuts in the bottom of your pan. Mix a dash of vermouth with your goat cheese and please, use half goat cheese and half cream cheese, (soften a few seconds in the microwave and add a dash of freshly ground pepper and a pinch of sea salt. Strained my pesto sauce and not a problem with being too runny. Chopped the roasted red peppers finely and layered as the recipe directed. This is awesome! You just have to use your head and be a little creative! Guests raved about it! This is a keeper.

Availability for the ingredients is a little tough in our area. I had to buy herbed goat cheese, which I would not use again. I used half goat and half cream cheese. No ready made black olive tapenade; I used artchoke bruchetta and food processed with some black olives.Which was flavorful. I used roasted red peppers mixed with tomato paste. I layered this torta into graduated condiment cups, piping the cheese in with a pastry bag. When set, I used them to assemble a christmas tree which I garnished with strung capers as garland and an origami fan for the star.Served with garlic bagel chips.It was good, and everyone was impressed with the presentation.

Very tasty. I drained the pesto overnight, but it still seeped out of the finished torta. I blended the goat cheese with a teaspoon of buttermilk to make spreading it easier. The recipe makes enough for way more than 8-10 people. We had 18 people at our party (other foods too, of course) and had a little less than half left over.

Was a hit at the holidays. Next time, I'll mix the goat cheese with 1/2 creme cheese to save on the cost and make it easier to spread.

This one is a keeper! The layering is pretty and offers a custom blend with each spread.

So delicious and easy!! I made my own pesto and roasted my own peppers but used store bought tapenade. Great make ahead appetizer that everybody (who likes goat cheese) raved about. Tried this with Brie as suggested by one reviewer, but it seemed impossible to get it soft enough to spread...disaster; stick with the goat cheese, you won't regret it!

Quite simple. A nice twist to standard goat cheese and tapanade. Any shaped preparation dish will do. A clear glass one will allow for viewing of the edges of the finished project.

I have been an executive chef in the industry for more than 15 years now and have never come across a worse, more miserable recipe than this. I have to believe that Gourmet/Epicurious does not bother to test-cook or prepare some of the recipes posted here, such as this absolutely BAD one. In order to save the appetizer course for a 160-plate banquet at which this recipe was asked for, I had to alter it completely - I used a pastry bag to pipe three rosettes of the chevre mixture onto plates, topped each of these with the respective drained pesto, tapenade and peppers, and served the plates with pita toast points. While the flavors pleased the guests and I was able to cover up the fact that this in no way resembled the appetizer originally asked for and supplied, I was deeply chagrined and very angry with this recipe. I cannot recommend it to anyone; it is defective and should be removed.

I served this at a cocktail party I threw for co-workers, and it was a huge hit. No one could believe I made it--there's a frou-frou food store here in town, and they all assumed I bought it there.

Love this recipe. It looks hard but is really easy. To break the taste of the goat cheese, (and to save a few bucks), I replaced some of the goat cheese with French feta. Yummy.

This was a big hit at our New Year's party. I found that heating a spoon helped to spread the goat cheese. I also had to substitute kalamata olive paste for the black olive (I couldn't find black olive paste or tapenade...), but it seemed to work very well.

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it was delicious. I like it better when I use less goat cheese, and more of the other ingredients, though. It's less heavy. I used a beautiful mold instead of a pan, and the it worked wonderfully. Great recipe! And, really very easy.

Maybe I'm not a cheese log person. I was a little startled by the great Multi-colored Loaf of Cheese I had created. It was okay, but I've had far tastier things on melba toast. by the way - patting out the goat cheese is definitely the way to go with this one. Thanks for recommending that!

I made this dish for a wine tasting party and have received many compliments. Works great with red wine!!

In response to the cook who had a hard time keeping the layers separate, thank you for the warning because it made me think before beginning. I actually made this in a round microwave dish, and instead of trying to spread goat cheese on top of the more fragile ingredients, I patted out thin hunks of cheese between my hands, approximating the size of the dish. Then it was a simple matter of placing the 'pancakes'on top of the spreads and doing a bit of smoothing. Worked like a charm and took me just a couple of minutes to assemble.

This was a relatively easy dish to make for a dinner party. It looks beautiful and tastes good as well. I prefer to reduce the amount of goat cheese slightly and increase the other fillings. THis is a keeper!

Looks elegant and difficult to make, but easy and yummy. Great make ahead addition to Thanksgiving menu. 1/2 a recipe was a perfect fit in a mini loaf pan. I'll be looking for another occasion to make it again.

Great recipe and easy to make. A couple of suggestions, I used Woolwich brand goat's cheese that comes in 4 oz packages. This divided the cheese up nicely and gave me the ability to add another layer; sun-dried tomatoes in oil. I rinsed them, patted them dry and then added them as my last layer. The only complaint was the basil pesto. I drained it longer than suggested and it still came out runny. I'm not a freak about little things like this going wrong, so it was okay, but I would probably make this the last layer. It was much harder to work with than the others and if it runs, it's on the bottom when put on a plate. Everybody loved it! I served with crackers and a sliced baguette.

Rating: 3
Though this dish tasted great, I had a hard time keeping all the layers separated. The flavors of the pesto, red peppers and olives were all a very nice compliment to the goat cheese, even mellowed the flavor a little bit, but my layers were not defined enough. If anybody has a suggestion on how to do this--I'd love to hear it!

Rating: 3
I made this for a small group last week and the consensus was that it was very good. It's not the greatest thing I've ever made, but certainly easy enough. Also, there are times when assembling is about all you have time for -- plus sitting for a couple days hasn't seemed to have hurt it.

To all the people who said they dont like the pungent taste of goat cheese...try mixing it with cream cheese or even cream cheese and butter. Thats what we did in the restaurant I worked in...saves money too. OH, and this is a lovely recipe, easy and beautiful. I would make it again. To the cook from Florida: Try asking at your local market or cheese shop to try the cheeses first, pick one based on what you like, not a company that Epicurious would be paid to endorse

I have asked Epicurious to specify goat cheese by brand in their recipes (to no avail)because it makes a world of difference in the outcome. If all of you would make the same request, perhaps Epicurious would consider the idea. Meanwhile, I found a very small goat cheese book at my local library by Ethel Brennan that helps me to make better choices at the store.

Hmmm - I don't understand all of the rave reviews. I have made much better cheese tortas. One from The New Basics Cookbook that was wonderful. Mine looked beautiful and everyone asked where I purchased it but what it scored in appearance it lost in taste. While it was easy and impressive looking, it wasn't wonderful tasting. I did serve with crisp pita chips which was the highlight.

Yes, I'm a "Queer Eye" fan, but I'd have to say that this dish is nothing like the "torta" featured on the show. In fact, I'd say that "Queer Eye's" dish was more of a fritata, and that this dish is closer to a terrine. Of course a rose by any other name . . . .

Um couldn't notice how many people have made this dish in the last week. Anybody want to fess up to watching Queer Eye??? Looks yum though - I'll have to try it soon.

I'm almost afraid to write this, considering all the vitriolic comments, but I have had something similar made with marscapone and it was very rich and delicious.

YUM, YUM, YUM!!! Half recipe in a round dessert dish lined with plastic wrap. I found this VERY quick and easy to make and did it the day before I served it. Very pretty and just delicious. I like the idea of the tomato/herb flowers and think I would put them on after unmolding. I enjoy reading all the "give and take!"

Don't know what all the excitement (and reviews) are about! Thought this was a very poor recipe. To achieve the look in the recipe photo they must have used four cups of goat cheese, because my layers were certainly thinner! and much less definition. End result tasted okay, looked pathetic and overall I was less than impressed. Expensive ingreds and lack lustre result. Would not make again.

Had no idea goat cheese was such a hot-button issue... This recipe was great for getting rid of all those half-empty jars of tapenades and bruschetta toppings in the fridge. I brought this to a ladies' luncheon and thought to beautify it with sliced cherry tomatoes and basil leaves to form flowers on the top prior to adding the ingredients in the mold. It came out very pretty indeed - and pretty tasty, too.

I tried the recipe as written, using Laura Chenel chevre. It was rich and pretty, but it could have used some fresh minced herbs, maybe rosemary or lemon thyme, sprinkled on top, to somewhat offset the unctous richness: perhaps alternate the cheese layers between plain chevre and a pepper/herb version.

Excellent! Easy to make and delicious. It does make a large amount, but is easy to cut down and it also holds well as leftovers. As I did not have a small enough loaf pan, I made it in a Rubbermaid storage container. Anything would work just as well. I am using the remains as a spread on turkey sandwiches. Delicious.

Rating: 3
This was great, but just too large to consider, because we don't have many big gatherings. So, I used a little more than 1/4 of the cheese, and 1/3 the amount of the fillings to assemble it in a mini-loaf pan. This was just right for my husband and me with a glass of wine, some veggies and crackers.

This came out VERY pretty... I made it exactly as the recipe called for only I used a fancy loaf pan instead of a plain rectangular one. However, it tasted BLAGH! I had extra pesto and roasted red peppers to I tried another loaf, but this time I used brie and it was wicked yummy. However, when I made the recipe exactly, although it was gorgeous, it was not good. (This is my opinion and 5 guests, however. the 6th and 7th guests loved it. Go figure). I will try different versions of cheese loafs because of this, so I'm grateful for the recipe, but I will not make this one again.

I am sure you can make this recipe with Farm cheese. I am going to try it, maybe you could also mix some goat cheese with farm to make it less "goaty". hehehe. Cooking is not a science, is an art. Improvise!!

This recipe sounds great but I am afraid to try it because (am I the only one in the world who has had this experience????) the only goat cheese I ever tried (in a trendy restaurant) tasted like a goat smells. Could someone recommend a variety of goat cheese that might be less 'pungent'? I eat and love all kinds of cheeses including those made from goat's milk, but am completely in the dark about what is called "goat cheese".

This is a wonderful recipe that turns out beautiful. I laid out a flower design before adding the first layer of cheese using shapes cut from the peppers as petals and fresh herbs for leaves & stems. Easy to impress with this recipe! (btw... cookie from Boston on 7/3, & any others stupid enough to go so far off tangent as to bring in WMD and war -- get help. quickly.)

I made the Torta for a dinner party and everyone raved about it and asked me for the recipe. I always have some homemade pesto on hand (frozen) and instead of using store bought tapenade, I chopped good olives and drained them well, for the same effect. For the mold, I used a plastic Tupperware container that was just the right size and I used parchment paper to line it. An offset spatula helps a lot to spread the ingredients, particularly the cheese. It took a bit longer than 20 minutes to assemble the dish however. I will certainly make it again.

This is fantastic appetizer! It's messy to prepare, but the result is beautiful. I used parchment for a cleaner look. I also used the full 20 ozs. of goat cheese. For 5 people, we had more than enough. I think the recipe serves at least 10 for a casual appetizer.

My two cents: There's nothing wrong with posting comments whether you've made the recipe or not. However, people who haven't made the recipe (or haven't made it as written) should please refrain from giving a "fork" rating. When you do this, it skews the overall rating of the dish. I don't mind reading comments or suggestions, but it is a bit frustrating to see either a really high or low rating for a dish, only to find that people are just rating it based on ingredients, how they think it will taste, their own version of the same dish, etc.

This is just superb. I am not overly fond of goat cheese but I love pesto, roasted red peppers, and tapenade. It resulted in a very flavorful mix to spread on bread toasts. And it looked very festive with the colorful layers. I used only a 9-oz log of goat cheese. That was more than enough to fill 2 1-cup ramekins lined with plastic wrap. That yielded about 12 servings of 3-4 toasts each. Yes, the ingredients can be expensive (I happened to have most on hand) but it's not necessary to use as much as specified in the recipe.

Rating: 3
lovely! a nice chiffonade of basil is a pretty addition to the top. also, toast the pine nuts if you are making your own pest. the flavor of the dish is very "bright", so toasted nuts add some needed depth. and......please chill on the negative comments! be happy that you live in Santa Cruz, can afford the time and money to eat delicious,healthy food and have access to a computer!

Confession: I haven't made this recipe. But, I devised a similar recipe myself that I've been making for festive occasions for a few years. I layer whole roasted red peppers (bought in bulk from grocer) with goat cheese and pesto. I do it in a large ramekin and line with saran wrap to get it out. It's always a huge hit. But I reserve it for special occasions because the cost of ingredients is so high. Good luck and enjoy!
