Oh this is a fun one. We sub puff pastry for the pie crust, so it comes out looking super fancy and really ups the "comfort food" factor. Lots of ways to make this one your own - I usually add whatever fresh leftover veggies that are lurking about in the fridge. We've also subbed other spices for the sage (e.g. rosemary, thyme) - it's a good base recipe that tolerates a lot of variation. Quick, satisfying and delicious - we especially love these on chilly and/or snowy days.

This is a quick and easy dinner that I really enjoy when I'm craving "comfort food". I am gluten-intolerant, so I use gluten-free pie crusts and gluten-free flour, but otherwise, I make this just as directed. Delicious.

This is definitely a keeper. Quick, easy, and delicious. My husband is severely lactose intolerant so this recipe was very easy to cook for him by eliminating the butter. I added some fresh vegetables and a touch of soy creamer to thicken it up. It was a hit!

Good, with modifications. DEFINITELY use the cream of chicken soup, it really added the right flavor and consistency. I read the reviews and used 2 pie crusts. Bottom cooked 10 minutes empty, top put on after chicken mixture done and cooked add'l 12 minutes. Added garlic, oregeno, rosemary, diced potatos and water.(chicken stock may have been better but didn't have any) For the left overs (I made extra filling) I think I'll try putting it in a cassorole with a Bisquick topping. Overall good and pretty quick if I make my boyfriend chop the pototos. Who would thought a tofu-raised hippie kid like me could make such good-ole white-trash cookin'?! ;-)

This pot pie turned out beautifully and really delicious. I used a pie dish instead of ramikins. I doubled the chicken and followed the advice of other cooks and used 1 can of cream of chicken soup instead of broth, but I did add about 1/2 cup of broth to the soup. Lots of flavor. Ready in no time and enough for leftovers.

Pie crust was a great idea and easy base. I used two crusts and a deep dish pie plate and it worked out well (see suggestion below...). I used 1 c. chicken bullion and let the sauce boil down to thicken before pouring into the crust, also added extra sage. (I used frozen veggies, I've never had them and they weren't bad! baby brocolli and french cut green beans) We thought it was a savory dish and a nice change from the creamy pot pies.

Made this on a snowy night with leftover roast chicken. Cut up the leftover meat into a dice, and instead of the sage, I used rosemary. Instead of frozen veggies, I cut up carrots and asparagus, sauteed them with a little butter and shallot. I think next time I would add a little heavy cream with the chicken broth, or use cream of chicken soup for a litte richer taste. Flavorful, quick and easy. The puff pastry didn't really work out for me, I guess I did something wrong -- it didn't quite puff up. But it's a great way to use leftover roasted chicken!!

ok, while i agree with the "pot pie as passion" argument, this is perhaps not the pie for the "purist" but let me tell you...with not a lot of time but a cold night and the need for comfort food, this fits. i added cream of chicken soup and just some broth, ans LOTs of pepper and a some chopped fresh jalapeno. served with buttermilk bisuits. not rally a pot pie per se but man was it GOOD! and took 25 mins total. a winner.

This is easy and delicious. I wouldn't add any extra salt, though. I use cream of chicken soup rather than broth, so it had a nice consistency. (Broth is much too watery for this recipe, unless you want a soup.) My daughter and I aren't crazy about the sage, so I always use very little. This is such a simple and tasty recipe that I make it often.

It was my first time making a pot pie and I was a bit nervous, but they turned out tasty. I added fresh carrots, corn, peas and potatoes and added a package of chicken gravy to some canned chicken broth for the sauce. It only took about 30 minutes to whip up and about an additional 15 to cook the pies in their dishes! A wonderful treat to make for the family after work.

I thought the basics were fine, but it needed some help. I used fresh veggies (potato, carrot, apple, shitake mushrooms, tomato.) I also added heavy cream, wine and used thyme instead of sage. I used a frozen shell and it turned out nicely! This was my first pot pie, and will make one again.

This is a great basic recipe, needed to be doctored up a bit. I did use frozen whole wheat pie crusts (from Whole Foods Market), but used fresh veggies rather than frozen, and it was just as simple. Just cut the veggies (potatoes, carrots, celery, onions) into large chunks and simmer in a little chicken broth with butter and fresh rosemary and thyme for 10 minutes. Add the chicken and simmer for another 10, then stir in some heavy cream. Dump into the pie crusts and bake per recipe instructions. Yummy! You'd never know the pie crusts were store bought.

This recipe pains me. Pot pies are a passion! Pot pies are a very special dish -- perhaps the ultimate comfort food! While ready-made piecrust, puff pastry, etc. is fine, frozen veggies are OK as long as they aren't cooked. But the sauce...! Canned soup should not be used on this sacred dish. A relatively simple cream sauce should be prepared, nicely seasoned to your taste), and then poured over the pie ingredients of your choice. Sauce ingredients vary, but always include butter/flour/broth/milk-or-cream. (I add white wine but that's me.) The sauce isn't difficult, it's basically a matter of assembling the few ingredients and then stirring. My brother's wives buy huge turkeys for the holidays, so that we can make several pot pies for the freezer. They freeze beautifully, and you already know what a terrific meal they make for your family...Forgive my rambling; as I said, pot pies are my passion.

Just made this tonight and it was a hit with my family. Easy prep. I did use cream of mushroom soup as suggested, as well as the fresh vegetables (carrots, celery, onions). I used ready made pie crusts (had to save time somewhere!) and baked one in the pie plate at 450 for 10 minutes, then added the cooked mixture, topped with the other pie crust (uncooked) then put it back into the oven at 450 for another 10 minutes. Looked wonderful and tasted great!

I give this two forks but it could be three with basic improvements. Definitely need to add a cream based soup, gravy, or roux to thicken. I used fresh diced veggies which, while not as quick, enabled me to add celery and onion for needed flavor. I've served this in pie shells or with buttermilk biscuits on the side.

I loved this recipe! I give it four stars not only for it's taste, but also for it's ease. I followed other recommendations and used a cream of chicken soup (mine had some herbs added). I also added rosemary to the flour and parsley and savory to the broth. I also added red skinned potatoes to the veggie mix. Lastly, I used Pepperidge Farm pastry shells--really enhanced the presentation.

I think the dish is great, with changes as suggested by the other reviewers (thank you all very much, your comments made my dish much better!). I used one can cream of mushroom soup, adding water to a desired consistency; skipped the sage; and used a pre-rolled pastry crust which I baked whole then cut into quarters (so quick). I suggest doubling the vegetables, which I will next time. For the ease and quickness of the dish, which tastes pretty good, this is defenitely a keeper for me and I will make it again.

I have used a jar of chicken gravy instead of broth. Much more flavorful!

A decent and fast recipe, but use cream of anything soup and half the broth- better yet is to use beef consumme in place of the broth.

This was such a disappointment. The pie was tasty, but oh so soupy! Even a tablespoon of cornstarch didn't thicken it up. Perhaps a can of cream of chicken soup would be a better ingredient than the chicken broth. Plus, how about a double crust?

This is a very easy and tasty recipe..but, I used fresh vegetables,(potatoes, rutabaga, carrots, and peas) cutting up into small cubes and I added fresh broccoli flowerettes to it. DELICIOUS!

I haven't made it yet. But when I do I will use frozen puff pastry instead of regular pie crust. And, not being a great fan of frozen veg, I would saute some fresh carrot, onion & celery (and maybe a crimini mushroom or two) chopped to 1/4" dice while the chicken is cooking. It may add a few minutes to the prep time but for me it would be worth it.
