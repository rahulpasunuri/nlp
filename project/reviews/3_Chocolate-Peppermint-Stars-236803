This seems to be a chocolate shortbread, and indeed the dough is tricky. Like other reviewers, I found it to be crumbly and unworkable first out of the fridge; I kneaded it like modeling clay to warm it up a bit, then quite frankly added a liberal amount of flour. The dough was quite sticky. The more flour I added, the better luck I had and in the end, the stars did hold their shape while baking. I drizzled the cookies with both bittersweet and white chocolate (and in the future would find a way to thin out the chocolate for easier drizzling). I put the trays in the fridge to speed up the setting process, but I have to admit the cookie is very attractive and quite delicious.

Made these for our annual cookie bake this year and they were a hit. You do need to use some extra flour when rolling out the dough but they are totally worth it. I made them into trees. The combination of the chocolate cookie, drizzled icing and crushed peppermint is divine. Had to make a 2nd batch for Christmas Eve.

I agree with other readers in regard to there not being enough flour in this recipe. After reading the reviews. I started with 1 1/3 C flour and used lots of flour when rolling and rolled to slightly more than 1/8 inch. I noticed that the first rolled cookies spread slighly while the re-rolled (with more flour now) did not spread. You definately need to warm up/kneed the dough before rolling. I melted the chocolate and added 1T crisco and piped thru a zipper bag with the corner snipped off (you can zap the bag for a few seconds if the chocolate starts to seize up). I also used the Andes peppermint baking pieces. Next time I make these I will start with 1 1/2 cups flour.

Easy, delicious, and beautiful... The recipe recommends you may make them 3 days ahead... but I found you may make them up to two weeks early and freeze or refrigerate. Instead of crushed peppermints(which stick in your teeth) I used Andes Peppermint Crunch baking chips... which are like a soft white chocolate red and white peppermint... and already in the little pieces you need!

I used Andes creamy peppermint chips instead of candies and I think that really made these cookies wonderful. The peppermint wasn't as strong, which made people that don't like peppermint much really like these. A very attractive cookie....I think maybe my new favorite!

I thought the cookie tastes good but is too delicate. I refrigerated the dough and they still broke easily. My friends prefered it as a plain chocolate cookie - peppermint optional.

These cookies are beautiful and very tasty, with some work. The dough is very hard right out of the fridge and once it becomes too soft, it does get sticky. You need to use a lot of flour and I rolled the dough in small amounts, adding a little bit of cold dough each time. They turned out great. I did not cook them the full time listed, as I wanted a softer cookie. I used peppermint baking chips, rather than peppermint candy (bought by mistake, but turned out great!) Everyone loved these cookies, a definite favorite!

Rich chocolate flavor and not that difficult to make.

I'm sorry that I bothered with this time consuming recipe: it's difficult to make (chilled, the dough is hard as granite, and after rolling and cutting, it quickly becomes gooey/sticky); the chocolate does not easily drizzle (you must fling it Jackson Pollack-style across a tray of cookies, which can be a huge mess); the cooking process leaves the cookies flattened and out of shape (a far cry from the perfect little stars shown in the magazine); and the final result is a cookie that admitedly has a nice taste, but is far too crumbly.

This recipe rates high for presentation but is difficult to make. The dough and chocolate is difficult to work with. The taste is good and similar to girl scout thin mint cookies.

These cookies rate high for presentation and would be good if you are going to a party or giving as gifts. They taste much like girl scout thin mint cookies and are nothing amazing. I also thought they were a lot of work and I had trouble getting the chocolate to swirl off the spoon like the recipe describes.

This cookie is tasty with a beautiful holiday presentation. I rolled cookies out closer to 1/8 inch rather than 1/4. I had no problems rolling out or cutting. I used 8 oz. of Ghiradelli 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips for the drizzle. I microwaved them for about 2 minutes on HIGH, rather than the double boiler method. I will add these to my list of Christmas cookies to make again.

These stars ended up working out, but they worried me the whole way through. Rolling out the dough at the perfect amount of firmness so the stars had nice sharp edges, but so that the dough wasn't too hard to roll out was tricky, The photo in the magazine showed a cookie that looked to be about one eighth-inch thick , not one -fourth inch. It took much longer for them to become firm in the middle, so I let them bake a lot longer. I squiggled white chocolate as well as dark chocolate on them and they needed that little extra shot of white. The layers of frosting and peppermint make them beautiful cookies and different from the usual ones that we see every year. Kind of a lot of work, but would do it if everyone begged for them.

This cookie is melt in your mouth good! I made it exactly as the recipe said. The dough is tempermental, but worth the effort. I baked them on cookie sheets with parchment, and let them cool completely before decorating. I also melted the chocolate in the microwave in a ziploc bag, cut off the tip, and used it as a piping bag. It was very easy. These cookies are beautiful, and will become part of my Christmas cookie tradition.

I would rate these as 3 and one half forks. These really taste good and are pretty! A nice holiday cookie but they do take extra time to make. I followed the recipe and cooking times exactly (with one exception: I baked two sheets at a time in my convection oven set at 300) and they didn't overcook or crumble . I baked them on parchment paper on air cushioned cookie sheets. Before rolling, I let the dough sit out for about 10 minutes after chilling. The thicker cookies spread more. I think these are worth the extra effort!

These are SO good! The scent of chocolate hangs heavy in the house as they bake - and the taste lives up to the hype! I did not chill the dough as it was easy to roll out but do be very, very careful when moving the cookies to the cooling rack - they are crumbly until they cool. I did not change anything in the recipe - they were perfect as they were. A real treat to have crunches of mint mixed with rich chocolate. Mmm.

The dough was easy to make. I did have trouble when it came to rolling it out. I put the dough in the refrigerator overnight and when I first tried to roll it out, it just wanted to break into chunks. As it warmed up it worked better. I cooled the scraps between rollings and they rolled out fine. The oven temperature worked fine, the time was about right. The cookies that I rolled a little thicker spread worse than the ones that I rolled a little thinner. I needed to flour the rolling pin, cutter and work surface well to keep the dough from sticking. I really liked the flavor.

Something is wrong with the temperature setting. i made the cookies thicker and baked at 350 for 10-12 minutes.

I baked these yesterday for a small dinner party. Made no changes to the recipe or procedure. They are time consuming, but fabulous! The window for working with the dough is narrow, but the results are worth it. Keep chilling remaining dough; also use bittersweet, not semi-sweet chocolate for a rich taste.

i'm surprised at all the bad reviews these cookies are getting. i found these to be great tasting and they looked beautiful. the dough is soft, so you'll want to make sure it has been chilled thoroughly, and don't roll it out too thin - the recipe calls for a 1/4", which is perfect. in case your dough has warmed up too much after rolling and cutting, put the cookie sheet and unbaked cookies into the freezer for about 15 mins before putting into the oven - this will keep the stars from spreading. i made these for a dessert party last weekend and have had several requests for the recipe.

The dough came out impossibly sticky. It took forever to get 12 cookies cut out. Some of them lost their shape in the oven, and they needed less than 25 minutes or they burned. The texture is nice and light - I would give these another try -

I concur with the below cook - this recipe was very dissapointing, however a few people have told me they like the results. They are so fragile - I wasted so many because they broke, and they were difficult to pack for gifts and store. Pretty but not worth the effort!

I wanted a new cookie for our holiday cookie platters we give to friends and this was a great addition. They are delicious and the cookie melts in your mouth. I put the dough in the freezer as I was running short on time. I think that if the dough is colder, they hold their shape better.

I strongly recommend against this recipe. If I'd seen the other reviewer comments, I wouldn't have tried this. (I pulled the recipe from the magazine.) Follow this recipe and you will find that these cookies are an unrecognizable, burnt, shapeless, crumbly mess. (Honestly, there must be a mistake.) I tried adding more flour, baking at 350 for 10 minutes and that finally worked somewhat better. If you try this, good luck! And if you figure out the mistake in this recipe, please post!

I followed the recipe to the letter and allowed the dough to refrigerate over night. However, once the cookie stars were in the oven, they lost their shape completely and became crispy round, oily disks. Seems to me they needed a great deal more flour than the recipe required.

I made this recipe for the first time and chilled the dough over night. I let it sit on the counter about 1/2 hour and then rolled it out. I had no trouble, but used quite a bit of flour. The cookies were delicious and everyone liked them. I would definitely make them next Christmas!

These are really pretty cookies and they taste great but as someone who is not a hardcore baker I found the dough really hard to work with. I have followed the recipe to the letter and chilled the dough for about a day. It was so hard to work at that point it simply broke into chunks. I had to warm it up a bit first before rolling it, and sure enough the scraps had to go into the fridge before I could roll it again. Its a nice recipe but there is a real sweet spot where that dough is workable and I don't like to have to be so precise (thus the reason I don't bake a lot). If you are a confident cookie maker though, go for it.
