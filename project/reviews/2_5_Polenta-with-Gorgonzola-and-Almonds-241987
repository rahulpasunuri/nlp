My boyfriend loved this. The only downside is that I can't find quick-cooking polenta, so I had to use the conventional slow-cooking variety.

I actually really liked this dish. I used normal polenta instead of the quick cooking (which I find has less flavor). I also added some gorgonzola (used the picante instead of dolce - personal preference) in the cooking pot towards the end so that it could melt a bit and spread its flavor around. I agree with previous reviewers about the almonds..not really necessary. Maybe next time with pinenuts or at least toasted almonds. Served it with balsamic roasted tomatoes and arugula.

The flavor was...not exactly bland..but subtle. You really can't go wrong with polenta and gorgonzola. I'm not sure I liked all the almonds. I could have done with fewer. And they weren't really justifying their inclusion flavorwise either. Still, I must say I ate about half the recipe in one sitting, so it must have been pretty good.

I thought this was going to be so delicious, but it just wasn't. It didn't have much flavor except for the almonds, which overpowered everything and just didn't taste right with the creamy polenta. Just missing something, and I have no idea what. I won't make this again.

This was tasty and quite easy. A dish I can see on a restaurant menu. But one caveat: As written, it makes a ton. I don't recall whether it was featured as a main or side dish. I served it as a side and we'll be eating it for days...there were at least 8 servings. Next time, I'll halve the recipe.

This would get a "delicious" rating, except I thought the pepper was overwhelming. I would add 1/2 as much next time. I really want that gorgonzola flavor to come through!
