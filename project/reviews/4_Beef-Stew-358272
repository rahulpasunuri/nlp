This is a good base for a beef stew. I used chicken broth, added tomato paste and a bouquet of rosemary and thyme to the recipe. It very good served with pappardelle noodles. I'd make this again.

This was surprisingly easy and so tasty. There is a lot of room for creativity as well. I added a bit more water to the pot when I added the onions/potato/carrots just so they were covered. 2 cups of broth didn't seem like enough. Seriously yummy recipe!

Excellent!! As per others, added red wine, worcestershire, tomato paste, rosemary, thyme, oregano & increased butter. The gravy is incredible!

Taste was good but meat was not tender using this cooking time. Would simmering longer have helped? Used stew meat and followed the recipe.

This is a keeper. My kids all loved it. Easy and satisfying. I served it with brown rice.

Great stuff. Like others said, this is an excellent, simple, straight-up base recipe. A few tweaks (to your liking) and it is superb. My wife (who is not a big beef fan) really enjoyed it as well. My adjustments were (with a nod to others who made so many good suggestions): (1) a half stick of butter to start; (2) because I was making this for someone who is gluten intolerant, I used sweet (fine) rice flour to coat the beef [the results were excellent -- browned nicely and helped thicken the sauce just as wheat flour; (3) I used 3 garlic cloves [1 just seemed too minimal]; (4) like another reviewer, I made a bouquet garni of rosemary, thyme, and oregano; (5) I also chopped up some fresh oregano and thyme and added them at the very end; (6) the red wine mentioned by one other reviewer was spot on (I used a good organic beef broth for 2/3rds of the total and 1/3 red wine -- cabernet sauvignon); (7) I added a heaping table spoon of tomato paste towards the end. It was just enough help thicken a bit more and add further depth of flavor; (8) the worcestershire sauce is also good -- I probably added 1.5 table spoons. One more hint -- brown the meat in small batches as less in the pan will help it brown up nicely. Also don't worry about using too much flour as some "over use" will form a nice roux in combination with the butter. This will definitely add to the depth of the sauce.

Additionally, I have made this recipe subbing chicken (for meat and broth) and it's still fantastic! I also read the book hoping there would be other great recipes, but none compare to this one.

I used this as my basis - jump start. I did not use the flour when I browned the meat. I sprinkled the meat with herbs de provence. ( didn't have a bay leaf). Once browned, i added a container of beef broth. Covered and simmered as directions. Added all the veggies plus more sprinkle with herbs de provence. To thicken liquid broth, I made a paste with flour and the broth. best stew i have ever made!

i used this recipe as a template making half. instead of flour and salt i crushed half a sleeve of SALTINES and added ROMANO CHEESE dust to coat the meat. i heated the oil with the bay leaves in it to infuse the flavor. when i added the meat i ground a little black pepper into the mixture. once the meat was browned i added the broth a small can of TOMATO SAUCE and a few shakes of WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE. i let the meat simmer for about 30 min then added the vegetables and let it go for 45 min. i got many complements on the aroma as well as the flavor.

This is very tasty on a cold winter evening. Some small changes - added 1/2 cup red wine to the broth, a dash of oregano, and let beef chunks simmer for hours in a crock pot before adding carrots and more onion. I roasted the potatoes separately to add variation in texture and flavor. The beef was tender and tasty. I will definitely make this stew again.

Four forks for simplicity and sheer tastiness. I made this recipe with GF flour, organic beef and garden fresh vegetables. Although three teaspoons of oil or butter is not nearly enough, you can adjust this amount intuitively while the meat is browning. Delicious, easy and fast...I will definitely make again!
