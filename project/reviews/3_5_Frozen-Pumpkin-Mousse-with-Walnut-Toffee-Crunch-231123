I would like to know if this mousse is "thick" enough to stuff cannoli shells Thank You

This was incredible! All my favorite flavors. I used pecans because I didn't have enough walnuts. The only change I would recommend is to start checking the toffee crunch after about 7 minutes -- my Skor bits were completely melted by 10 minutes (and the recipe said to bake for 15, which would have burned everything). It's WORTH the extra few minutes to make the toffee crunch. Reminder to those complaining about the addition of chocolate that it's just the Skor or Heath bits you're supposed to use (same aisle as the chocolate chips), not the chocolate-covered candy bar. I made 8 portions -- would not make portions any larger unless I had a defibrillator handy!

Made this for coworkers that work night shift. One of them said "it tastes like christmas." Another took some home and her kids raved about it. I couldn't find Skor so I used Heath bars as suggested.I also left out the rum as 1 of my coworkers is pregnant. No one noticed. I topped it with a spiced whipped cream: - 3/4 cup chilled whipping cream - 2 tablespoons sugar - 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon - 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger Beat whipping cream, sugar, cinnamon, and ginger in bowl until peaks form. The final product was a bit loose, almost "soupy." I don't know how I would thicken it to the consistency of a traditional mousse, but everyone enjoyed it regardless.

Very simple to make. I quadrupled it to make for a party with 35+ and served in a large bowl. I whipped 7 egg whites to firm peaks and folded them in at the end to make it more airy, similar to the last step in other mousse recipes. Presented beautifully in a clear bowl with a layer of whip cream and crunch all over the top.

This dessert for Thanksgiving ruined my reputation as a decent cook. The stores had run out of canned pumpkin and I used real, and it just didn't work out. We had to throw it out. Another part that didn't work, the toffee recommended--Skor's?--had chocolate, too, and that just didn't mesh with the whole flavor thing.

This was delicious! Made six portions and refridgerated until well chilled: did not freeze. Added topping just prior to serving as per previous comments. Will make again for sure.

Made this twice for two parties this holiday and it was excellent and a keeper. However, general feedback is that we prefer it unfrozen. I also crumbled quality ginger snap cookies you get from World Markets. Also used pecans instead of walnuts. The toffee/cookie crunch with this marvelous melt in you mouth mousse was heavenly with a great cup of coffee.

I think the people that rated this poorly before must have been doing something wrong! I've been making it exactly as the recipe instructs since it was published in 2004 and always get rave reviews. I also agree that it is rich but is worth it! Is one of my favorites.

This is delicious! I did not freeze it and assembled each serving as needed so that the topping wouldn't get soggy. I used the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin because I made the mistake of tasting the pumpkin mixture before adding the whipped cream and then panicked because the taste was so STRONG, (not thinking about how much whipped cream would be added) so I added all the pumpkin and all the whipped cream. My family and I liked the chocolate that was part of the Heath bar toffee bits.

I made this dessert last year for Thanksgiving and people are still talking about it this year, so I'll make it again for sure. We are a bunch of sweet tooths, but it was still a lot even though I made six portions. I may go to eight this year. I haven't done it frozen because people said how good it was just refrigerated. I agree!

I think one thing most people are not aware of is that spices need to be fresh in order to make things taste good. They need to be kept in a cool dry spot and replaced at least once a year. Another thing, do not skimp on quality ingredents and follow directions to the tee. Peoples oven temps vary also. Just be aware of all of the above. I thought this recipe was wonderful and even people who do not like pumpkin loved it. Most people said it tasted like ice cream. It is quite rich, I agree so take a smaller piece and enjoy.

This was absolutely delicious, and so much easier to make than a pie. I skipped making the crunch, and just crushed up almond roca candies to layer. Like other reviewers, I agree it doesn't need to be freezed. However, I think freezing helps keep the consistency while you're busy making other things. The crunch did get soggy, so I think next time I'll sprinkle it on top AFTER freezing. I'll definitely make this again... The look was impressive, and pumpkin flavor perfect. Everyone raved!

This was sensational! One of my new favorite desserts to make! My guests thought it was delicious and one is serving it to her family for T-giving. I used chopped up Heath bars for the toffee.

The pumpkin taste just wasnt broad and delicious as a pie would have been. I liked it but the rest of the family despised it, oh well such critics.

This was a disappointment. Mousse virtually lacked pumpkin flavor and became even more bland as it came to room temperature. My guests were polite but unimpressed. I'll not make this again.

Too rich, too pumpkin-y. No one really liked it. The toffee crunch was very good, but it didn't make up for the mousse and got soggy after a few minutes on the mousse anyway.

Rating: 2
I thought this dessert was just okay. It was too rich for me. Almost everyone else, however, loved it, even some apparently picky eaters. I would make it again because others seemed to enjoy it so much, and it's a great alternative to pumpkin pie and can be made ahead of time. I did not freeze it overnight; I froze it for probably 2 hours and that was just fine.

Didn't make the crunch, just the mousse. Subbed brandy for the rum. I did not want to freeze it, so I ate it as is, though I did need to add about another tablespoon or so of cream. Absolutely divine.

This is one of my staples...I'm a pumpkin freak, and a sweet tooth. It was not at all complicated for me to make, and it did make a lot (esp. the crunch) and was good both frozen & without...everyone raves every time I make it.

I thought it was pretty good although not everyone at the table finished their portions and my father told me it was not the best dessert I had made. The crunch was the best part, even if it didn't hold it's shape. It makes a lot but make sure it is thawed for about 30minutes prior to service. Probably won't make again...

Back again...I think the most important comment I have about the recipe is that it DOES NOT NEED TO BE FROZEN...it's actually too hard that way unless out on the counter for 20 minutes.

I DREAM about this dessert..... I've made it now 3 times. I agree with other reviewers that it really yields 6 servings of resonable size or 4 large ones. I now make half again as much of the "crunch" because it's SO good!!

Rating: 3
Don't do what I did and blindly follow the directions for making the crunch. I ended up with horribly burned crunch. Had to throw it out and ended up doing what many other readers here did on purpose: just use the Heath bits and refrigerate rather than freeze the mousse. The mousse itself is wonderful, though.

I follow a gluten-free diet so am always looking for desserts I can eat. This was quite good, though I made a few modifications. I used 3 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and an additional 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Plus, I doubled the rum. I used Heath bars and pecans instead of walnuts. Be generous with the crunch. I did not freeze. Leftovers the next day had soggy nuts. This is better if eaten the same day.

I liked this, but did not love it. I agree with others that is is better from the fridge rather than the freezer. I made 6 servings rather than 4 and still only one person could finish the desert. Made the recipe as written except for the serving size. I would make again with much smaller servings and more spice.

Rating: 3
I thought this was pretty good. I used rum flavoring instead of real rum and it was a nice touch. I also added more cinnamon and and nutmeg than the recipie called for to give it a little kick. This was a nice alternative to pumpkin pie. Although I won't make it again because it didn't have the wow factor I look for in desserts. If I'm going to eat something that is that bad for me it better be really amazing.

This is a keeper! As suggested by other reviewers, we tried it frozen and just refrigerated - like the refrigerated version better. Also, Heath Toffee worked fine, and I omitted the walnuts. Because the dessert is so rich, we used smaller dessert dishes, and got 8 servings with no problem.

This is a keeper - delicious and can be made ahead! The reviews really helped me. I tried it both frozen and just refrigerated - liked the refrigerated the best! I used small dessert dishes, and the recipe was enough for 8. Heath Toffee Bits were fine, and the walnuts weren't necessary.

This was soooo good!! I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the assorted ground spices, and it came out fine. For the toffee crunch, I crushed up some Skor/Heath bars after having scraped the chocolate off, as suggested by another reviewer. It was good after having just been refrigerated a long time.

This is a delicious recipe. I modified it as follows: used a whole can of pumpkin, did not use allspice, did not freeze it. It was such a hit. Everyone asked me to make it again for Christmas! It's well worth the effort!

Very yummy and can do ahead. Way to sweet however, next time will reduce sugar. Makes more than the recipe says. Also make a lot of crunch. I used Almond Roca because there are no Heath Bars in HK

This was great except a little to sweet for my taste. Can make ahead which is a huge plus on Turkey Day

This is a great fall dessert. I, too, was tempted to use Heath bars until we learned that Heath packages toffee bits that are sold in the baking section. I agree it makes more than 4 servings. I used 6 glasses as that was how many it took to use the filling. I still have about 1/3 of the crunch left over. I did also use the entire can of pumpkin. I would prefer to use canned (or fresh) pumpkin rather than pie mix and add my own spices. I am going to try thawing it a bit before serving the next time.

Excellent, easy. Elegant make ahead dessert. Definitely agree that the portions are too large. Easily serves 6-8 depending on appetites and size of the meal preceeding.

This dessert is delicious. I made the walnut crunch topping with heath bar bits and used a pie pumpkin from my CSA. Served it frozen as suggested. Very good, but the problem is, it's very rich. It's a lot to have after a large meal. It could have easily served 6. I'll make it in smaller portions next time.

This is an elegant and special alternative to pumpkin pie! You should find the toffee baking bits, not the toffee bars covered in chocolate. If all you can find are the bars, just scrape the chocolate off with a knife. That's what we did. I do like the walnuts included. I served it out of the fridge, not frozen, and it was gobbled up. I loved the creamy texture and didn't want to ruin that by freezing it.

If you want rave reviews from guests, this is a definite dessert to make! Perfect for Thanksgiving because it's unique. Very easy to make. I've made this twice now. Here are some time savers that don't affect the taste at all: skip step 1 and just chop up Heath (or Skor) bars, no need for walnuts, etc. The chocolate on Skor/Heath bars seems out of place with the pumpkin, so I left it off--which happens to most of it when you chop anyway; buy a can of pumpkin mix instead of just plain pumpkin--it contains all the spices you'd have to measure out in the recipe. Whole Foods carries the organic type, which is fabulous; and use the whole can of pumpkin (which is about 1/4 cup more than the recipe calls for--it gives it a richer pumpkin taste. A tip for presentation: pour the pumpkin mousse into fluted champagne (plastic or glass) glasses and then freeze. Top with whip creme before serving (but add sugar before doing so or it's too sour). My guests thought it was perfect frozen and just melting. My family didn't care for it straight from the fridge as another reviewer stated.

I made this for 30 people (multiplied everything by 5 and it was enough). It was delicious when it was a mousse, but not really that great after it was frozen. I took it out one hour before and it was still hard as ice cream. Much much better before you freeze it. I have one serving still that was not frozen and two days later it is still fine and delicious.
