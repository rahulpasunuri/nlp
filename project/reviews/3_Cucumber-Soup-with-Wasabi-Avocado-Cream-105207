I love this "soup." Like some of the other cooks, I leave out the ice. Also I put everything together rather than having a separate garnish: cukes, water, vinegar, lemon juice, a little salt, wasabi to taste, and creme fraiche instead of yogurt. I didn't have an avocado when I made it today, but I'm sure it would be better with the avocado.

The Wasabi Avocado Cream is great. The "soup" is a joke. Instead of all that salt and water, try this: Use any type of cucumbers. Peel and put in the food processor. Don't add water. Don't bother to remove seeds. Just puree with the vinegar. Add 3 scallions. Puree. Add a half teaspoon of garlic powder. Puree. Refrigerate. SKIP the ice! 20 minutes before you serve, spoon into serving vessels and put in the freezer. We had this last night and it was the perfect antidote to blazing hot weather.

I hate to say this but I made it last night, and I'm probably throwing it out today. I love cucumber soups and I was so dissapointed!

Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to make it anyway (the picture is so pretty). I was disappointed, like many others. The flavor in this is too raw. As we all ate it, the best we could muster was "at least it's good for you."

I added dill, garlic, green onions, white balsamic vinegar and skipped the water and ice, and used about 1/3 cup of whipping cream and it turned out pretty tasty.

This soup was actually pretty gross by itself, even with dswood's changes, BUT, the Avocado-Wasabi cream was AMAZING. I ended up pairing it with the gazpacho recipe at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/printerfriendly/MOMS-GAZPACHO-105096 , and I have to say it was pretty amazing!

I've made this several times and also found it delicious. It always pleases guests and is one of my favorite no-cook summer dishes. Last night I made a batch and it was so salty we couldn't eat it, as other reviewers here have noted. I realized this morning that I had used sea salt, instead of kosher salt (which I do normally use when cooking...the sea salt just happened to be out). Kosher salt is half as salty as sea salt and conventional iodized table salt. Use the kosher salt called for or use half as much sea salt or table salt.

I followed the suggestions of the reviewer who included the link: www.thecleverchef.net/archives/2006/05/ cucumber_soup_with_wasabiavoca.html This saved a lot of work.The addition of garlic and onion to the cucumber base made it less bland. Using the cuisinart for the avocado cream made it smooth and velvety--resulting in a nice combination of textures. The avocado cream is delicious and could be used with fish, chicken, or even on a canape of some sort.

I made this recipe with some minor changes to make it a bit easier and tastier... www.thecleverchef.net/archives/2006/05/cucumber_soup_with_wasabiavoca.html Is the site where all the info is at.

What I did was salt my cucs for two hours in the fridge to get out the water. I also used butter milk instead of water.

Tho an easy soup to make it lacks punch. The soup base of cucs and water is just that, watery. The avocado cream perks it up, but just not enough.

Wasabi is a Japanese condiment, primarily used in North America as a flavour added to soya sauce to give it an added kick when dipping sushi in soya sauce just before eating it... the first time you try it, go very light, then see if you want to add more. If you can't find it in your town, try over the web with places that specialise in Eastern foodstuffs, such as www.EthnicGrocer.com (and Epicurious has a link to them, too!)

what is wasabi? I am just a farm girl. Could you please define terms like wasabi??? Never heard of it.

I did not have wasabi. Instead I used the double amoung of creamed horseradish. Probably not as spicy, but good. Reading the recipe, I thought it would be too watery and we like thicker soups. so I used two avocados and imitted the ice. We did not think it was too salty at all. Håkan from Colorado

Big success. I used about 1/2 the salt (and I like salt) and only about 3/4 cup of crushed ice. Yes the soup is bland but it is the combo WITH the fantastic sauce that makes it so great.

Very tasty and the wasabi adds a wonderful "kick". Next time, I might use a little more.

The soup was far too salty and indedible, but otherwise would've been nice. Will try it again some time with less salt. The wasabi avocado cream was good and would make a wonderful sauce with salmon or some other dish.

loved the wasabi-avocado sauce. instead of blending the soup with ice, i set it in the freezer, scraping the sides of the bowl to mix the ice crystals. in the future, we plan to use the soup to make a a granita served between courses, with a dab of the cream on top. teh recipe calls for too much salt for those who usually cook without it; my husband, however, saltlover that he is, thought it tasted just right.

The cucumber soup itself is very plain, but refreshing. The wasabi cream is what makes this dish - don't skimp on it.

Delicious! I would use less salt next time, the soup tasted a bit salty.

This is just the dish for a hot summer evening!

Very easy and quick! Served in plastic marguerita glasses poolside, the wasabi avocado cream perfectly accented the icy cucumber soup. Everyone went back for seconds. Huge hit on a hot summer day!

The cucumber soup was refreshing, but probably not worthy of serving to company. The wasabi-avocado was strange - we ate the soup without it.

There was just something off about this soup. I agree that it was too thin, it was missing something, the avocado-wasabi cream was strange... I make a gazpacho that is just fine, and I think I'll stick to that. Sorry, Gourmet-- this one just didn't do it for us.

The texture of this soup was too foamy and it had very little flavor. The avacado cream was good- I ended up throwing out the soup and using the avacado cream as a vegetable dip.

This soup was easy, light, and refreshing -- but nix the wasabi-avocado cream.
