i love lemon so automatically added more juice and zest to both the icing and the cookies. I liked the dryness of the cookie; the icing povides the flavor! However, I will use a cookie press next time because the pastry bag was way too messy for me.

If you are looking for a recipe that comes close to the lemon knots sold in Italian bakeries and Starbucks, this is it! These cookies, often an complement to coffee, are supposed to be a bit drier and spongy. The texture could be a bit more "dense," but overall, delicious!

Halved the recipe and was disappointed. For the calories, and the concept, I should hope there is a better recipe out there for the lemon plus shortbread plus icing concept. Can anyone suggest one? I would hope for a cookie that would be first of all much more moist. Also, the icing was too simplistic and unable to convey a strong enough flavor for the mild cookie. Not nearly enough lemon flavor in either icing and cookie. I am fine with mild flavor, and in fact I love a cookie my friend Caroline makes a similar mild cookie she calls "Amish cookies", though it does not have the lemon flavor. Does anyone know a recipe for Amish cookies?

The flavor is not very vivid, but to overcome the issue of the 'dry' cookie, I suggest adding 1/4 cup of confectioner sugar to the mix and take the cookies out a minute early....this kept my batch very soft and moist.

A waste of time and ingredients. The icing, even with extra lemon juice and lemon zest, tasted mostly like confectioner's sugar. The cookies are very dry.

just made these tonight - the batter tastes great, but the final result is sort of like a denser, dryer madeleine - too dry to be really good, but probably good for dunking. Maybe less baking powder would be good, so it comes out more like a denser butter cookie.

I liked this recipe a lot. Do not over cook these cookies--they get dry pretty quickly. I found 11-12 mins adequate. Also, I found that using a cookie press was MUCH easier than a piping bag. I also took the advice of other reviewers to add more lemon zest (whole lemon) and more juice in the icing (2T), and I liked the amount of lemon flavor. All in all, a good recipe.

This is an excellent recipe! I too made drop cookies with a pastry bag and cooked them at 350 for 25 minutes. They were golden brown and light. Next time I will add more lemon juice and zest to really give them a tang. Definitely a hit.

Cookie was very spongey and thick, very dense. Not a great cookie, will keep looking for a better one.

I did not find these cookies to be heavy at all - quite the opposite. I used a pastry bag and made very small drop cookes (not rings) and baked for 12 minutes only, finding that they were cooked perfectly without being dry. I used the zest of an entire lemon and felt that they still could have been slightly more lemony. These were good but not as good as the lemon cookies at Via Matta, in Boston, which were light in texture and very lemony but had a slighly savory/salty? flavor. Will try again and experiment with adding a couple tablespoons of buttermilk and/or maybe salt.

i was really disappointed in this recipe. I expected the cookies to be light and to "melt in your mouth," but I found that that rose way too much and were too dense and heavy. Try a different recipe instead.

Divine. These came out perfectly. Lemony and light.

These were delicious! I made a couple of modifications to the recipe: I omitted the icing, and added 2 tablespoons of lemon zest to the dough. I used a smaller tip to pipe the cookies (all I had) and they only required 15 minutes. They came out crisp and light with a nice hint of lemon. Much better than packaged Italian cookies!

Easy to make. I used the zest of a very large lemon. Next time, instead of using water in the icing I will use all lemon juice for the most lemony flavor. The dough is sticky, but stays together, doesn't make a mess. I think small mounded shapes would be just as well as the rings.

These are the cookies I've been looking for ever since left New York! I used the zest of an entire large lemon for the cookie because I love lemony-ness. My husband and two year old couldn't get enough of them either. Delish!!

These cookies are good, but don't eat them right away. I tried some a day later and they were so much better!! The flavors must have blended.

I used the zest of two lemons; the cookies were just delish! It was kind of stiff for piping at first, but as the dough warmed up, it got easier! I used a star tip and made little S shapes; lovely! I used all the juice of the 2 lemons in the icing too - make sure the icing is really hot and liquidy and it won't get sticky!

This is a delicious after dinner cookie-great with coffe,tea or espresso. I had to add MORE lemon and bake LESS. The sticky dough I found hard to handle and after 2 tries of "bagel" looking cookies...I opted for " snowcaps." Love the cookies!!!!

I added extra lemon and still found these to be bland. Too much work.

I used 3tsp of grated lemon peel baked for only 10 minutes(other review ssuggested this.) The cookies were on the dry side and there was not much of a lemon taste. Not a bad cookie but not worth splurging on either.

I like this cookie but you HAVE to add more lemon peel 3 tbs

These cookies look like little tiny bagels. Exactly. But they taste like lemon cookies. Easy to make with a subtle taste. Perhaps we got overenthusiastic with the icing, but it stayed sticky rather than hardening. We added extra lemon for more flavor. And did we mention that they look like little tiny bagels?

These turned out quite well although next time I would use a slightly smaller diameter tip and less baking time.

Baking the cookies for 20 minutes would be way too long. I did 15 minutes maximum, and they were not burned or hard, but the cookies themselves were rather bland and dry. They were salvaged, however, by the wonderful icing, which is where all the lemon flavor resides. I made them for Christmas, and sprinkled with red or green sugar while the icing was still wet. They were pretty.

After reading the reviews, I was disappointed with the end result. Baking the cookies for 20 minutes resulted in a very hard cookie and I found them bland tasting - not much lemon flavour at all. As my family love anything with lemon, this was a little disappointing.

I've made these cookies several times, always with success. They make for a refreshing dessert after a heavy meal, like lasagne.

These are very lemony and we loved them. The icing is the best lemon glaze I've made so far.
