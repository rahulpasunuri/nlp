I have been preparing this green bean recipe for Thanksgiving dinner for the past 8 years. It has replaced the heavy green bean casseroles of Thanksgivings past and is the dish I most anticipate. While it is simple enough to prepare year round, I save it, along with my fine silver, for special occasions so that I may truly savor it.

This is okay, but IMO, there are better green bean recipes on this site. The very similar recipe 'Green Beans With Garlic, L emon, and Parsley' has more pizzazz, especially if you add a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts.

an exceptional bean recipe - easy, festive, lovely, and keeps the flavor the beans front and center with lovely lemon to boot!

I love butter, but this had a bit too much for even me with not quite enough flavor. That said, I'll definitely make again and just reduce the butter significantly. I did love the combination of lemon and pecans, and it looks lovely on the table.

Quite good. But it is still green beans. The butter is rich, so use it with lighter sides. Don't be afraid to up the lemon. It doesn't over power the dish.

would have liked a bit more flavour and make sure to toast the pecans first...I didn't so they laked the extra crunch

Great for a fruit-themed thanksgiving. Used orange instead of lemon. Definitely toast the pecans for better nutty flavor.

I am coming back to this one again for some of my holiday cooking. The fresh flavor of the lemon and parsley in this dish makes the plain jane green beans come alive. I agree with the other reviewer and would cut down on the butter; the recipe just does not need it.

I made this for Easter dinner yesterday, and it was VERY tasty. I used a zester for the lemon peel. Very good combination of flavors, and the lemon flavor made it perfect for springtime. The only change I may make in the future is cutting back a bit on the butter, but I will definitely make this one again!

This dish is terrific and very easy. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and I followed the recipe to the letter: I prepared the beans the day before and refrigerated them, chopped the lemon peel and parsley as I was preparing the turkey for the oven Thanksgiving morning, then assembled the whole dish in one skillet in under 15 minutes while the roasted turkey was resting. The lemon flavor is subtle and refreshing and the nuts have a nice toasty crunch. Everyone loved it - and this was the first of the leftovers to disappear from my fridge after the holiday. I'll prepare this again and again and I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe as written.

This recipe is delicious! I only gave it 3 forks because it's difficult for me to give 4 forks to a vegetable dish. But as far as vegetable dishes go, it was great. We ate it with pork tenderloin and mashed sweet potatoes with a little cinnamon, allspice and brown sugar. I agree with all others who said 5 TB of butter is too much. WAY too much, I used 3 and it was still a bit heavy. I also left out the parsley because I didn't have it and it was still great. I very much enjoyed the lemon flavor, I zested it and it was very, very subtle. I also frenched my beans and microwaved them for about 3 minutes til crisp/tender, then stirred them into the butter and pecans immediately. No ice bath, and frenched beans are so elegant and a little more delicate in flavor to me. Will be making for Thanksgiving and I think it's going to be a huge hit. Am even considering increasing the amount a little for my next attempt. Delicious!

Excellent side dish, perfect flavors. Also easy enough for a weeknight and nice enough for a holiday. I am making this for thanksgiving this year.

Excellent dish -- I have made it several times, for different guests, and everyone has raved about the flavor!

Perfect combination: Completely simple and simply delicious! I prefer it with orange peel, finely grated with my rasp--one of the great tools. I also reduce the butter. I toast the pecans in the oven and then toss everything in about a third of the indicated butter. To those substituting almonds, try it once with pecans. The combination is terrific.

Rating: 3
Completely agree on too much butter. Half does fine. Used slivered almonds and it worked well. Best to serve right off the stove so the nuts don't soften.

What a wonderful recipe! I made this as part of a birthday meal and it made a very nice presentation, but it's so simple, it could easily become an every day dish.

Rating: 3
Served this dish as a side with meatloaf and mashed potatos. It was great, the pecans added fantastic flavor! My only suggestions are to lessen the amount of butter (was a little heavy) & to make sure the lemon rind is chopped into fine pieces (to make for a more subtle taste). Enjoy!

Have made as per recipe, and switching lemon for orange, and have used toasted pine nuts, or walnuts instead of pecans. The original is my favorite- nice change for a fancy looking but easy side dish, and works well with previously blanched and frozen beans frozen from the summer.

These were easy and very good. I did use less butter, as some of the other reviewers recommended. The lemon flavor was very distinct, but worked well with the other flavors. The pecans were a nice change from almonds - and I much prefer them.

If you are a pecan lover, this is your recipe. This was a smash success at Thanksgiving this year. I only changed one thing. I used fresh California Oranges, their zest, and their juice. Try it, you won't be sorry.

Recipe didn't have the flavor I was expecting...I used only 3 teaspoons of lemon peel and it was still overpowering....if I were to make this again I would use very little lemon. The dish was very pleasing to the eye, it looked great just didn't meet my expectations.

Wonderful dish w/easy prep. I made it for Thanksgiving this year, and it was well received. I would use less butter next time. Italian parsley is a must!

A great replacement for the more mundane Green Bean recipes. We left out the parsley with no discernable effect. Also most of the preparation can be done a day before, simplifying the preparation at dinner time.

Perhaps the nuts must be more finely ground, but the flavours did not marry well when I made this dish.

Rating: 1
I followed the suggestion of substituting orange for lemon. Either way the recipe seems flawed. Citrus and pecan strike me as an odd mix, one that certainly does not compliment the beans. At best we found this recipe to be bland, in greater truth, we found it to be a turn-off. Most of the beans found their way down our garbage disposal.

wonderful, fast and easy. I had a dinner party for 12 people, there wasnt one bean left.

A great complement to Pork Stew with Apricots and Prunes - the last stew of this winter season. This recipe earns four forks for taste, ease of preparation, and compliments from our guests.

Prepare all the ingredients in advance and this is easy to toss together at the last minute. I have served this twice with roast pork and gotten great reviews both times. I agree with the cook who recommended going heavy on the lemon; this is a good variation on a standby vegetable that almost everyone likes.

I normally like fresh lemon as an ingredient, but the lemon and green bean combination was not as successful as I had hoped.

Rating: 4
I think this dish very nicely dresses up green beans for a special occasion. I parboiled the beans and chopped the pecans, parsley, and lemon peel the day before, so it only took 10 minutes to put together right before dinner. French green beans make it even better, although standard green beans work fine. I thought the pecans would over whelm, but they don't. I also clarify the butter.

This was a good dish and a refreshing change. Made it for Christmas, and got fairly good response. It could have used a little more kick - I added the juice of half a lemon also and that seemed to help. Overall, very worth doing and I will be experimenting with this one!

I made this with skinny French green beans, to accompany a seabass entree for a dinner party we hosted the week before Thanksgiving. It went over very well, and I would agree that you don't want to forget to season with salt and fresh ground pepper. Also, cooking the beans in advance made the final prep a cinch.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving when I was asked to bring a green bean dish. The hostess raved over it and not only asked if I would leave some of the leftovers behind, but also asked for the recipe. My only note is that I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to really season this dish. The lemon was nice touch, but alone didn't seem flavorful enough. I will make it again, especially because it was so easy!

This was a hit at a potluck recently. I had been asked by the hostess to bring a veggie dish, and since I am less than enthusiasic about vegtables, I turned to epicurious. I prepped everything ahead, and at the party, spent 10 minutes finishing off the dish. It was a hit, and so easy.

Absolutely delicious. I made a double-recipe as a sidedish for Thanksgiving, and it was the one item for which there were no leftovers. Everyone commented on it, too, saying how good it was. Two people asked for the recipe. Cooking the green beans the day before was especially helpful in cutting down the preparation time.
