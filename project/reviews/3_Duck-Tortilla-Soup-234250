I used a whole box of Chicken stock (32oz) and the whole can of organic MUIR GLENN whole tomatoes (trim off the top stem area) WITH the tomatoe sauce inside to thin this down. PLUS about 3 cups water. Be sure to leave plenty of time or make a day ahead! Well worth it! But a lot dif. than traditional tortilla soup.

Awesome soup; what's better than duck fat? I really enjoyed the creative approach on frying tortila strips in the rendered fat. Nice way to utilize all the bi-products.

I'd give this 2.5 forks. It was delicious, but very rich and fatty, even though I skipped the tortilla frying and used baked tortillas instead. It was also so thick that I'd suggest serving it as a main dish over rice or flat noodles instead of a soup.
