Outstanding recipe. The best I have ever made.

This is a time-consuming, but truly exceptional dish. Just out of the oven, it's the best foccacia you've ever had - and, because of the potato, it's also surprisingly filling. I've already made it twice within a couple of weeks, and the reception from my friends guarantees I'll be making it again.

This was wonderfully light and tasty. I did not find any sourdough flavor at all. Very easy, too -- perfect for lunch or brunch.

I loved this recipe. Not very difficult and the oil makes the top and edges of the bread nice and crispy. Overall the bread has a sourdough flavor, I think from the potato, although I am not sure. I loved it, but if you don't like sour bread you may not like it.

I'm concerned how good the recipe will be since Focaccia is spelled incorrectly.
