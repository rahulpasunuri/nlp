The first time I made it I thought it was missing something and while good, a touch bland. The second time I spiced it up with a tiny bit of heat (red pepper) and a little curry. Then the recipe was a wow.

Rating: 1
I thought it was awful. I couldn't even eat an entire bowl of it. I took other reviewers' suggestions and added 1T curry. That was way too much; it was over powering. I also thought there was too much ginger on the shrimp.

Rating: 4
The only thing I didn't follow exactly was I added extra star anise. I actually think mine were kind of tiny, so I bet I was close to what the recipe called for. I considered adding five-spice, but I didn't want the least bit of brown in the absolutely beautiful orange soup. Also, made the soup 2 days ahead of the party which was really convenient. After pulling out anise before pureeing, I put the used anise and a couple new ones in some cheesecloth in the soup while it sat for those two days - I think that helped. Can't believe how simple a preparation for the shrimp could be so delicious. All in all, beautiful, subtle flavors, easy to prepare and big hit with all 9 people at the party.

I just made this for a luncheon with friends and it was fabulous. I managed to find star anise in the supermarket and used it with some trepidation. I was worried there would be too much shallot, too (I find it a bit strong). Uncharacteristically I made the recipe pretty much exactly as written except I left out the water, too. DELICIOUS!! I cut up most of the shrimp and put one or two whole ones on the top. It was really easy and REALLY good. Last comment - I bought frozen pre-cut squash - 1 1/4 pounds - and it was exactly 5 cups, as called for. So a bag of frozen squash is just right. This is PERFECT for a dinner party - easy, seems fancy and tastes delicious.

Fabulous with gingered lobster tail chunks instead of the shrimp for a really elegant soup.

DYNAMITE!! I had already started boiling my buternut squash for another kind of soup when I ran across this recipe in the "shrimp" section. Like others, I had some qualms about anise -- can;t stand the stuff -- but I followed another reviewer's suggestion and subbed 5-spice and wow! Only had a big bag of frozen shrimp, so I soaked the ginger in about 1/4 cup orange juice and used the liquid to speed the defrost. Next time I'll use the concentrate -- frozen shrimp lets down a lot of water. But the orange taste didn;t hold back the shrimp at all. Quite the contrary. I'd consider adding a bit of orange zest to the marinade next time.

I've made this several times now for holidays. The first time I made it as described. It is a little bland for my taste that way. So, the next time I added some curry, more ginger, and a little dried crumbled Thai red pepper (just a hint of heat). It is fabulous this way and everyone raves over it.

One of my favorite soup recipes, skip the water, add 1 to 1.5 tsp of curry powder, triple grated ginger, add some to soup, and be sure to drizzle some of the skillet fried ginger bits and oil over soup and shrimp. My acorn squash diced was about 8 cups and the 4 cups of chicken broth made the perfect velvety texture.

Rating: 3
I would be remiss to not add a few suggestions to the recipe for any curious/interested souls. After completely forgetting to pick up star anise, I decided to spice things up--literally--with a little yellow Thai chile I had on hand. Yum! Also, made shrimp stock out of the shrimp shells which lent a delicious sweetness to the broth. Also added more ginger as suggested by other users.

Rating: 0
I am going to need to make this again based on the other reviews. I made just the soup. I added some fresh ginger and an extra star anise (I love both). It totally overpowered the squash and the flavors didn't really go together as I hoped they would. I recommend trying this exactly as written (except for the additional 2C water) before attempting to modify.

This was excellent, elegant, simple, and perfect for a dinner party. I too wanted mine a little thicker than it ended up and just simmered it to desired consistency. Made enough for about 4 large bowls.

Rating: 4
Wow, and that's saying alot for someone who doesn't like squash soup. I added a teaspoon of finely minced ginger and 4 star anise to the stock. Because I did add the amount of stock/water that the recipe stated, I turned the heat up to evaporate the stock to where I thought the soup would be thick enough. After putting the soup in the blender, I returned it to the pot, added 1/8 C of cream sherry that I use for cooking and simmered it for another 5 minutes while I sauteed the shrimp. The sherry added another layer to the soup's taste. I added an equal amount of minced garlic to the ginger marinade. My husband loves it and the best thing is the recipe is a perfect tasty addition to our P90X diet.

made this for Christmas dinner. Huge hit!

This dish also makes it into my top 10 rotation. I loved the complexity of this soup with very few ingredients. Since ginger is believed to help with cold and flu I like to use a lot of ginger in the winter. I made this exactly as the recipe stated and next time I too will add more ginger to the shrimp before cooking. Star Anise is one of my favorite spices and gives the dish the added depth. I buy it in bulk and use it in many reciepes. It never goes to waste.

Wonderfully creamy soup. Great recipe to make when you want something healthy & satisying but have practically no ingredients! It's a very forgiving soup... I accidentally made it with only 4 cups veggie broth and not the additional water and it was perfect consistency that way. I had small mild onions I added because I didn't have enough scallions. I also didn't add the shrimp because I didn't have any so grated about a tablespoon of ginger into the soup toward the end. The last thing I didn't have was anise so I added about a tablespoon of Pernod. Very good, will definitely make again and try some of the other additional ingredients suggested.

We loved this soup. It's creamy, but without the cream! As suggested by another, I skipped the water and used all chicken broth. Also mixed leeks & shallots. No other changes. The prep is quick and easy. It's a keeper.

Rating: 4
This was incredible I did not add the water, just low sodium chicken broth. I had to substitute the star anise with anise seeds in a muslin bag . I added 1.5 tsp. of anise seeds into a muslin bag. The shrimp is amazing marinated in ginger. Next time I will triple the ginger cause sauting the ginger and shrimp in oil made yummy little carmalized ginger bits that were incredible on the soup. I added 1 tsp curry powder used one butternut squash which cut up was about 8 cups. used one shallot, two cloves of garlic and added 1 tsp. of grated ginger. This was so incredibly yummy and once blended so velvety smooth. I made the spinach with apple and crispy almond salad.

Rating: 4
I'll definitely make this again! I didn't use the shrimp. I used ginger- infused canola oil instead of butter (I had it left from a stir-fry the night before) and added grated ginger to the garlic/shallot saute. I loved the star anise but like a stronger flavor so will use 5 next time. I also added 1T soy sauce and 1/2t white pepper. I used an immersion blender and the result was a beautiful thick, smooth, rich soup.

I'm a student living in school residence, so I have limited time and supplies. Here our the fast substitutions I did for anyone in a similar situation: I cut the squash in half lengthwise, the wrapped each in paper towel and microwaved for 8mins (this saved on cutting and simmering time). I used red onion instead of shallots and chopped it finely I used a mix of chicken stock and veggie stock (didn't have enough of either alone) I also used allspice instead of star anise (again, couldn't find it) Then I topped it with lots of parmesan cheese. Not sure how much different it tastes from the original, but it still came out delicious!!

Best butternut squash soup I have ever had. Star anise really adds a unique and interesting flavour. Don't hesitate - just try it!

Rating: 4
This soup was delicious and hugely popular when I had over 15 people over for a dinner party. I had to make a larger batch so I increased some ingredients and altered some of the process with much success: 2 butternut squash, 2 cups of shallots, half a stick of butter, 12 cups of cut squash, 1 quart of broth and enough water to make it cover the squash in the pot and 4 star anise. Also, after I puree the squash and returned it to the pot, I re-joined the star anise which never became too strong or overpowering. Also, I made this a night ahead. The day of the party, I decided to saute some chopped up shrimp with both fresh and ground ginger in some truffle oil, then added 2/3 of the shrimp and some of the cold soup into a blender. I blended the shrimp to a puree and added that and remaining shrimp to the cold pot of soup. This was great to immediately stop the hot shrimp from further cooking. The soup was later quite easy to heat quickly when it was time for dinner. GREAT DISH!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe that I can simplify. Combine the shrimp shells with the star anise in a sachet d'espice ( a cheesecloth "tea bag") and omit the marinating step. Keep the sachet d'espice in the stock/broth for the 20 minute simmer. Then put 1 tsp of ginger in the soup prior to the blending step. Buying your squash already peeled and cut makes this an quick easy recipe. Substitute a 1/2 tsp of curry powder for the ginger for a change of pace.

Really nice flavor but the texture was a little off for me the first day. It was too soupy and I wanted it to be a little more like a puree. Anyways, I'd probably add potato or lessen the amount of stock in it.

So simple and the star anise is a nice flavor with the ginger shrimp.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I used only home-made chicken stock and omitted the water, added only 2 star anise and added just a touch of curry in this recipe. We loved the soup! We will probably make it again within the week. Frequently we have guests who are afraid of the cream that is an essential ingredient in the majority of our entertaining soups. No cream here, but the soup tastes as if it was loaded with it! Fabulous soup!

WONDERFUL! I messed up and ended up with a soup that was a little salty but just stirred in a bit of cream and it all evened out. I agree that the curry is a wonderful addition but I like it according to the recipe also.

This recipe by itself is only 3 forks, but the additions I made brought it up to 4 for me. Definitely add the curry as others suggested. I left out the water as well. I didn't think shrimp sounded very good with this, so I left those out, but still added in the full amount of ginger before blending. Instead of shrimp, I added carmelized pancetta, which was what made it really stand out. The recipe for the pancetta was taken from the link below. Just keep in mind that you have to watch it very carefully! http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/caramelized-pancetta-and-fennel-salad-recipe/index.html

Just made this for dinner tonight...this is definitely a keeper! I must say that I did go along with previous reviewers and kept the chicken broth to 4 cups without adding anymore liquid. It was just the right consistency. I changed it a bit by adding a carrot for sweetness and the recommended 1T of curry. I also chopped a few shrimps and added them to the soup. Will make this again and again!!

This is a FANTASTIC dish! I did make a few small changes though. 1) I did not add the water (as suggested) and I'm glad that I didn't. 2) I added a pinch or two of the following spices: pumpkin spice, red pepper, Chile powder, cinnamon, paprika, and nutmeg. 3) I did not have star anise, so I used regular anise. 4) and I cooked it all for a little less then 20 min (only until the squash was tender). When I served it I only got one suggestion, next time I cook it, COOK MORE!!!!!

Rating: 4
Very very good. I agree - the shrimp is NOT necessary (the shrimp flavor is sort of bland anyway, and shrimp is so expensive). The soup is so creamy - delicious. I couldn't find star anise, so I used 1 1/2 tsp of anise seed and just left it in (it says to pull out the star anise, but the anise seed is way too tiny to pull out, and I liked the flavor). Following the reviews, I omitted the water all together. The consistency is perfect.

Made it without shrimp. Agree that it would be way too thin as written. My squash yielded approx 8 or 9 cups, and I used 4 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of water (just enough to cover the squash to simmer it). I still ended up leaving about half a cup of broth in the pot when I blended. Also took many of the other suggestions on seasoning - added 1 tbsp of curry powder, 1 tbsp fresh grated ginger, some cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of maple syrup. Ended up tasting great with some complex flavors but wasn't exactly the original recipe.

Rating: 4
The soup was good. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground ginger instead. Worked well. Like other people, I also added one tablespoon of curry powder, a dash of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of pure maple syrup. The soup came out a little watery, but if you just leave it on the stove at a rolling boil for ten minutes or so, the consistency of the soup should thicken up to the point where it'll coat the back of a wooden spoon. I will try making it without the curry next time to see if it's still as good. There's so much of fall and winter left...This is a great recipe for the coming chilly months.

Rating: 2
This could be a reaaly nice soup, but you either need to use more squash or less liquid. Very bland without the curry power and tons of seasoning as recommended by other reviewers. The best thing about this dish is the ginger marinated shrimp, they were delicious and very complimentary. Next time I would probably double the shrimp number per serving. Can't give it more than a couple of forks though as too many additions to the original recipe are essential.

Rating: 3
I have my own butternut squash soup recipe that I have made for the last ten years, but tonight all I had was a butternut squash, a piece of ginger, and a few pieces of star anise. I still prefer my recipe with ingredients like coconut milk, chopped raw cashew nuts, ginger, half apple juice/half chicken broth, and cashew butter, but this was a great recipe when you have practically nothing in your kitchen. I also didn't have chicken broth so I used beef broth (a little too salty for the squash) so I added skim milk and water to balance it out. I also added a tbsp of almond butter because I had it around and a lot more ginger than the recipe calls for.

Rating: 4
I didn't make the shrimp so I am only reviewing the soup. Great recipie. This is my second time making it. Last time I used chinese five spice because I didn't have any whole star anise. It was mush better with the whole star anise. I also added the curry suggested by other reviews. A great addition, it made this a four fork soup.

I usually mess with recipes quite a bit, but my husband snatched this one out from under my nose and made it EXACTLY as directed. (Well, he did grudgingly admit to adding an extra half-clove of garlic.) It was really, really unusual and delicious, and super-easy to make. We scarfed it down in front of the TV, but it would also make an excellent starter for a schmancy dinner party.

I could not believe something that uses no cream would taste so, well, creamy and decadent. I made a two serving portion and didn't measure anything since I was just making it as lunch for myself, and it came together in no time. I'd try adding a pinch of cinammon and/or curry next time but honestly, this is just so good as is.

We love Anise and this recipe has alot of that flavor, so much so it NEEDS a tablespoon or more of curry to balance it out. We added it to our bowls but next time I will follow the suggestions of the person from Toronto 1 Tbsp curry and omit the water for a thicker soup. It will then be the best butternut squash soup ever.

Second time I make this. First time, I omitted the star anise and used dried ginger instead of fresh on the shrimp. Unglamorous I know, but the taste actually sticks better to the shrimp and allows it to keep its structure. This time followed the recipe exactly as shown, and to tell you the truth, I like my first version better.

I didn't make the shrimp, so I'm only rating the soup. I took the suggestions of a few other cooks and added one tbsp curry powder and omitted the extra water. The result was a nice, rich creamy soup with a wonderful complexity of flavours, none of them overpowering, it was just the perfect combination of sweet and hot and whatever taste you'd say anise has. Will be making it again for sure.

This is the first time I've been led astray by Epicurious reviews. The star anise was overpowering (and I tend to overdo spices), the shrimp was nasty, and the cilantro didn't help. The butternut squash soup with red pepper puree is much better. I should have stuck with something I knew was good.

Rating: 3
Loved the soup but beware that the enzymes from the ginger don't really "cook" the shrimp (like lime juice when you're making ceviche) but rather it breaks it down, making the shrimp a bit mushy an unappetizing. I wound up making another batch of shrimp, only I sauteed the ginger for 30 seconds, then added the shrimp. After it came off the stove, I added chopped cilantro, salt and pepper. It was much, much better.

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish and so simple. The star anise added a wonderful complexity to the flavor. I did follow others' advice to omit the water (just used the broth). Consistency was just right. Would have been too thin with the additional water. The shrimp add a great contrast to the soup.

I skipped the shrimp, adding chopped ginger with the garlic and star anise. I used all the liquids, since I was looking for a lighter soup. I think I prefer curried squash soups, I found this a little sweet. I do like star anise and squash, in fact am addicted, but perhaps not together. No worries, the leftovers will get eaten. Maybe it will be better today.

This soup is excellent! Quick to prepare and very healthy. It has a creamy texture without the fat of using cream. I found other reviews were correct about it being too watery. If you like a thicker soup I would suggest doubling the squash, shallot and garlic and leaving the liquid the same. I used 2 cups of stock instead of the suggested 2 cups of water. It just added more flavor. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and chopped the shrimp. It was still dramatic and there was a tasty bite of ginger shrimp in every bite. Great for a weeknight meal or any time you are looking to impress without a lot of fuss.

This was hands-down the best recipe I've made from this site--and I've made quite a few. Agreee w/ some reviewers that the soup works fine as a stand-alone item w/out the shrimp; but the shrimp are, themselves, delicious and the ginger really adds snap to the dish. That said, I made a few modifications: 1) Found other reviewers entirely correct in that the soup is far too watery if you follow the recipe. I prefer a heartier, thick puree, so I added only a dash of water to the broth rather than the cup or so called for. (Even so I still ended up draining the second batch of soup significantly before pureeing.) The nice thing about the preparation--pureeing in 2 batches--is that you can judge the consistency and make modifications between the batches; 2)While the star anise flavor was delicious, I also wanted a bit more zip, so I added 1+ tsp ground cinammon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 2 tbsp maple syrup. 3) To get more of a fall harvest feel, I also added 3/4 cup chopped baby carrots to the mix, which produced an excellent texture and color. Will try adding some fall apples next time. I served this dish with a hot-from-the oven sourdough loaf and a full-bodied zinfandel. Yum! This is now a staple in my household. Enjoy!!

I have had this soup many times in tpo notch restaurants in Vegas and this is as close as it comes to their recipe. Great exactly as stated.

I made this for Christmas Day and everyone loved it - the soup was easy, elegant, and delicious. BUT we all agreed that the shrimp really added nothing to the experience.

I served as the starter course for Thanksgiving using the teacups and saucers from my china service (I don't have bowls) and all 11 guests RAVED about it, even those who said they don't like squash. I couldn't find star anise at the time so I used about 1 T of anise seed, which I did not even bother to strain out. No one could believe it didn't contain cream. I will definetly be making this soup again and again. Quick and so elegant! Make it. You will love it.

This soup was so popular last Christmas that I added it to the menu this Thanksgiving. My previous review (4 forks) noted that guests raved that the soup was delicious and rich, though it contained no cream, and could be made ahead. This time, I was puzzled that people were less enthusiastic and found the soup a bit bland. We added a little more salt, and the flavor was much improved. I will pay close attention to the salt when I serve this soup again and will be mindful that a dish may be received differently on different occasions. It depends on the season, the menu, the ingredients, the guest list, and who knows what else. I served the soup in white coffee cups with their saucers. It was attractive and easy to eat for guests watching the football game. I did overhear one guest say it reminded him of "Gerber Baby Food," and those words are ringing in my ears as I eat the Thanksgiving leftovers tonight.

Wonderful soup! I used a carrot as well and cut down the water and the texture was perfect. Blending in pot with the hand blender makes this exceptionally easy and avoids the dangers of pouring hot liquids back and forth. Star anise is readily available in Asian food stores where you can usually find cilantro and shallots as well.

This soup is so simple to make, few ingredients, a clean sophistocated taste and festive color for Autumn and Christmas. It has a marvelous creamy texture without using cream. I couldn't find star anise anywhere so used anise seed and strained it after pureeing. Sometimes I don't bother with the shrimp and just have the soup with homemade crusty french baguettes.

Oops ... be sure to remember to remove the star anise BEFORE you blend the soup. But even with this little disaster the soup was excellent (once strained a bit). I agree with the previous reviewer from San Fran that little morsels of shrimp are nice. However, the drama of the tailed shrimp sticking out from the bowl can't be beat. My solution? Do both! Cut up a few of the shrimp, and leave some intact. (Oh, I also marinated the shrimp with a few cloves of garlic and some minced chipotle in adobo sauce in addition to the ginger -- gave it a nice extra kick. Highly recommended.)

I confess that I'm just starting to cook seriously, and this was the first soup I ever made. I wasn't able to find star anise, so I just used some anise seed (about a tbsp) until it seemed fragrant enough. I made it for Christmas dinner, and ended up preparing it a few days in advance, which just seemed to intensify the flavors. My family aren't big squash fans, and they all raved about it. I'll definitely cook this one again.

I'm not a huge fan of the flavor of anise so I only used 1.5 stars, which added a nice subtle flavor. The consistency after blending for a minute is excellent. I thought that I might need to add a bit of cream to thicken it but no need. I used some frozen pre-cooked shrimp that I had in the freezer but definitely recommend using fresh, raw shrimp. Very easy to prepare.

I've made this soup twice now. The first time I made it exactly as directed for Christmas Eve dinner and it was impressive, especially with the shrimp. The second time I used no water-just extra broth, and I added a carrot. This made a much richer soup, that stood alone fine without the shrimp. Either way, it's definitely a keeper.

This soup is really lovely and has a delightful flavor. I served it as a first course for Christmas dinner and people were still raving about it by dessert time.

Nice subtle flavor, however the soup is a bit thin. I would make it again with 1 cup of water not 2. You can always thin it later if you like.

I just made this soup, and it was heavenly. So much flavor and richness, without a lot of fat or any cream or added sugar. The ginger shrimp was so good by itself, I started eating much of it before the soup was ready. The texture of the shrimp turns this soup into a luxurious dish. Here are some suggestions: 1) though the large shrimp on top looks dramatic, next time I would take off the tails after cooking and cut the shrimp up into bite size morsels. I think this would not only be easier to eat, but biting into a nice piece of shrimp would be a pleasant surprise and perhaps some might even mistake it for a piece of lobster. In fact, if you have money to spend, lobster could be substituted, or if you want to save money, buy smaller shrimp since you'll be cutting them up anyway. 2) If you're a beginner, when you puree the hot soup, be sure to hold down the lid and take the little cap off of the lid to allow the steam to vent (cover the hole with a towel); otherwise, you'll spray soup all over the place. 3) The 3-qt saucepan is just barely adequate. If you use something bigger, you could use a hand blender to puree the soup.

This is a magnificent soup. The anise makes it so wonderfully aromatic and it's creamy without the calories of cream!

Wonderful. So much flavor. The squash and anise go together and with the ginger shrimp what else can I say. I will make this again very soon.

Could not find star anise so used an Asian 5-spice recommended by a chef I ran into. It's the same one you read about if you look up star anise in the learning section of this website. Used 1 tsp of the 5-spice in lieu of the anise. The soup tasted good. I added a little salt and some fresh ground black pepper.
