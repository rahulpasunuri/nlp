This is not a quick cake to whip up, but it it sure is delicious! The combination of the flavors in this cake is divine. I've made this cake twice so far (or was it three times?) and it's turned out amazing each and every time! And it tastes even better the next day! I did make a few modifications, however: (1) The first time I made the cake I found mousse a little too loose. Afterwards, I always reduce the cream in the hot mixture by about a 1/4 cup and up the white chocolate by a couple of ounces. Also, fold in the whipped cream only when the white chocolate mixture is completely cool. (2) Cool both the cake and mousse overnight before assembling (3) Cut the quantity of the ganache in half. I only poured the ganache on the top of the cake and felt it was sufficient.

What a terrible recipe. I am an experience baker, and I've never had a cake stick to a properly prepared pan the way this one did. My cake split in half parallel to the bottom of the pan, despite following the recipe to the letter and using high quality equipment. My dessert for Christmas is now reduced to crumbled cake in a trash can. If I were to attempt this recipe again, which I will not, I would make two thicker cake layers, or perhaps use a different chocolate cake recipe, followed with the mousse and ganache.

This is not an easy cake to whip up, but it is both gorgeous and delicious if you can pull it off. It is, however, not one to attempt to transport without serious modification. I followed other reviewers suggestions to wrap w/foil each layer, when adding the cream and the cake turned out beautifully. The ganache is perfect and the flavors are amazing together.

The flavors of the cake, mousse, and ganache melded together very nicely. A few changes: 1)Use parchment paper when preparing the cake (not sure why anyone wouldn't use parchment paper for a cake...) 2) Make sure the white chocolate mixture is cool, very cool, when adding the whipped cream 3) Use 10oz of chocolate and 1 1/4 cups of cream for the ganache.

Cut the cream by 1/2 and had no probelms. I have made 2 variations as well for birthdays, instead of peppermint I chopped up 85% cacao and it ended up with a very expresso like taste. The other I made was with frozen peanutbutter cups instead of peppermint, and added some peanutbutter to the mousse as well. Great recipe!!

I only made the cake portion of this since I was looking for a simple chocolate cake recipe. Outstanding! Easy to make, moist. Yummy! And three days later, it is still as moist as it was the day I made it. Would make again and again and recommend it to all! Made it with a simple chocolate-grand marnier frosting recipe adapted from the powdered sugar recipe on the powdered sugar box. Super yummy.

This cake is a lot of work but not as hard as it sounds. I'm quite new to baking and I pulled it off no problem. Read most of the reviews and it will help. I made the mousse two days before and let it chill for 48 hours. It worked out perfectly. Line your cake pans with wax paper, the layers are VERY sensitive. But it was definitely a winner and everyone was amazed by it!

Wow! Good cake. And of course everyone else is right... lots of work at least the mousse is. Next time I make it will not add the cream to the mouse - will end up with very thick creamy layer, but will still be great and a ton less work. Also cut the ganache in half and had more than enough. And put applesauce for half the butter in the cake and you cannot tell (less fat!)

This is exceptional. I made it for a birthday party at work and everyone LOVED it. Even those who were professional bakers were impressed. I don't like white chocolate so I used dark for the whole thing. It was exceptional! It is a lot of work...six hours plus letting it sit overnight & it uses 2 pounds of chocolate. It is worth it though.

Excellent, very very rich, but an excellent recipe. After reading the previous reviews, I too cut the cream by 1/2 cup & baked it in 2 9" cake pans, cake seemed sturdy enough!

Everyone raved about this cake, with its subtle peppermint flavor and overall richness. I baked the cake layers ahead & froze them. I made the mousse with only 1/4 cup cream mixed with the white chocolate, and chilled the mousse overnight. When I assembled it with the layers still frozen, I didn't smoosh them down enough to get the mousse all the way to the sides of the cake, and it never spread at all!! (Next time I will use 1/2 cup cream in with the white chocolate, only 1/4 cup less than called for.) I waited and smoothed on the ganache right before serving and sprinkled some York peppermint pattie baking bits on top. Next time I will use my own similar cake recipe that is a little more forgiving- these layers did crumble & crack a bit although no one knew it but me. I also carefully coarsely crushed the peppermint candy but after the mousse was chilled they all melted in anyway, so next time I'll use the food processor.

I am always up for a challenge, and I succeeded with this recipe! Raves galore! It is time consuming and tested my perfectism. Study the reviews as I did and it will be a success. Use half the whipping cream, chill the mousse overnight, and cut the ganache recipe in half. I topped the finished cake with a colorful ribbon and flower as I would to a present making a wonderful birthday presentation. I can't wait to make it again!

I usually don't have problems with baking, but this was a bit of a disaster! I followed the recipe to the letter and read the reviews posted here prior to starting. While I was unable to chill the mousse overnight as suggested by other cooks here, I did let it chill for at least 10 hours. It seemed to be ok when I assembled the cake. But it never truly set, and as I walked out the door for Thanksgiving dinner, the cake completely slid apart. The flavors are lovely, but I don't know that I would try this again just to get it right. But to others who are planning on making this, heed the advice of past cooks!

I made this cake for a party recently, and it got rave reviews! I was initially very nervous about making it, as it was the first time I attempted baking something this extravagant, but I read all the reviews and took the suggestions to heart, and it came out perfectly! Definitely had to let the mousse sit in the fridge for awhile though, and the tower idea to keep it in place made all the difference. I added some chopped Andes mint to the top, and it was a great finishing touch! This is a keeper, incredibly decadent and a wonderful presentation.

Got the recipe from the new Bon Appetit Cookbook, did not think to check the site for comments or suggestions. Followed directions exactly. The cake stuck to the pans,would line the pan if one was making it. Mouse never congealed. Cake is now in the garbage and will make something else for the Super Bowl party.

This cake has become a family favorite and my brother and daughter always request it for their birthday cake. It is VERY rich, and should be served in smallish pieces (one can always have seconds, especially on one's birthday!). The receipe shown makes a lot of mousse, but I always have "volunteers" to eat the extra! It's easy to overbake the cake, so take care. I make the ganache with Scharffen-Berger chocolate when I really want to please the foodies, and they RAVE. This recipe will definitely be handed down in my "box of favorites."

I made this cake for Easter, but used the mousse from the chocolate mousse torte recipe. After baking, I used a spring form pan to chill the layers of cake and mousse and keep the filling contained. Instead of pouring the ganache, I let it sit until spreading consistency-almost 21/2 hours! I decorated it with sugar dough calla lilies and a gold bow. Everyone raved.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic cake and so beautiful. It makes a great presentation. I made it just like the recipe said and didn't have any problems. It's just a very time consuming recipe to follow, but if you have the time, it's definitely worth the effort. To save some time, I froze my cake layers a week ahead of time and the mousse seems to work better and not squish out that way. It's a delicious cake.

Rating: 3
The peppermint mousse is heaven!! It does tend to slide out the sides of the cake as you are assembling, even with all the chilling. But with patience, chilling between layers and that foil tower idea from a previous review, it worked out. Half the ganache recipe was enough to coat the cake. I cheated and used a devil's food cake from a mix for this first try - I was so scared of the mousse, I wanted that to be the only challenge! Still the best cake I ever made and a hit with friends. By the way, you might want to chop up the peppermints by hand, or go easy in the food processor....mine turned into pink dust.

This cake was perfect for Christmas, and was enjoyed by everyone--I had no problems at all making it. I chilled both the cakes and the mousse over night, and let the sour cream/white choc. mixture cool completely in the fridge before adding the whipped cream. I also beat the cream to stiff peaks, which seemed to help. I refrigerated the cakes in between adding the mousse, too. I added 3/4 tsp peppermint extract to the mousse, and 1 tsp to the cake, which made it a little mintier. All in all, a beautiful dessert I would def. make again!

This was a delicious cake, and surprisingly I had no problems with it. I made sure to read all the reviews before starting, and my mousse came out perfectly (it turned light pink, but I didn't mind) -- I didn't cut back on the cream, and I think the key to making a firm, non-soupy mousse is to really beat the cream until it is stiff. I beat the cream for 5+ minutes, it was fine. Just to be sure, I refrigerated the mousse for a few hours and it was fine -- it didn't run when I assembled the cake. The next time I make this cake, though, I think I'll cut back a bit on the white chocolate. I took the advice of other reviewers and refrigerated the cake layers too, and they were fine -- not crumbly at all and held up very well. This is a delicious cake -- a bit time consuming, but well worth the effort. And be sure to beat the cream until it is stiff! I think that's the key to having a firm but spreadable mousse.

I followed all of the previous tips by reviewers. I am an experienced baker/cook that does a lot of baking and have high quality tools for best performance. This recipe did not impress me at all. The cake though it didn't fall apart as others experience, did appear lifeless. The mousse had a grainy texture and a very unappealing appearance.

Rating: 4
This and the Austrian Walnut Torte will always be my favorite from Epicurious. I completely GOOFED when making this dessert--I put in all of the cream at once for the mousse. Once I realized it, I chanced salvaging--I threw in my ice cream maker w/ chopped peppermint candies. WOW. what a fantastic mistake!!! worth it all the way. went on w/ recipe again and now with the ice cream on the side, we never had more compliments. yes the cake is a bit tricky to put together, but absolutely worth the trouble. Am making again this week.

I made this cake exactly as written after seeing it in the magazine. Serves me right not to check the Epicurious reviews first! I used Ghirardelli white chocolate in the mousse. Even after several hours of chilling, it was still soupy. I had to serve it as a sauce on the side. No presentation points at all for me! My guests reassured me it was a great cake, but no one asked for seconds. I think I'll experiment with the rest of the cake. I've got the remaining mousse in the freezer and I will write again if it miraculously transforms my opinion of this recipe.

the best chocolate cake ever!! very rich but worth every calorie.

Rating: 4
It was perfect. I think that this cake and the Cuban Opera Cake are the best cakes on this site. Cut the chocolate topping in half. Line the pans with either parchment or wax paper. Most important, make sure the white chocolate mixture is completely cooled (I actually refrigerated it) before adding the candy and the whipped cream. Otherwise, your mousse will be more likely to run and turn pink.

I did not have a problem with this recipe at all, I didn't reduce the cream, but I did refrigerate my mousse, for several hours before assembling, and it turned out beautifully. I split in half for a friend and she just raved about it, will definitely make again!!

FABULOUS! Well worth the effort. Reading other reviews is a must. Chill, chill, chill that mousse! I made two cake layers in standard round pans and one in a professional pan. The professional pan made the layer crack. The remains were delicious! Once assembled, messy as it was, this cake was fabulous. I made it last year BEFORE reading the reviews. Will make again and again. Well worth time, effort and money.

Great cake. Instead of 3 layers, try two layers and poke holes with wooden spoon in cake to use more mousse. Less fussy and makes a great presentation.

I made only the mousse, not the cake or ganache. The mousse tasted fine, but wasn't that exciting. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used only 1/4c. of cream in the melted chocolate mixture, which gave me a perfect consistency. However, the flavor of the finished product was not worth the effort.

The cake tasted fabulous! As my sister said, it melts in your mouth like mint chocolate ice cream. But the foil barricade while assembling is a must, as is cutting the cream just a bit. Beware, it's a fussy little beast.

Wow, what a disaster! I did not think to read the reviews here first and just had the recipe pulled from the magazine. It has taken me the entire day to prepare. The ingredients taste awesome but the cake is a nightmare. I finally put it in a springform pan to try to save it, but the pan is too big - it's sliding apart everywhere. Definitely read prior reviews and heed their advice. I can see that this cake would be awesome if the cake didn't fall apart and the mousse was stiffer. Bon Appetit could have helped it's audience a lot by testing this recipe first.

Great cake! I had no problems, and I am not an experienced baker by any means. I carefully read user reviews and took all tips to heart. Made it for a friend's birthday. Hit of the party.

I make this cake every year for my father-in-law's birthday and he says it's one of the things that makes it worth living another year! It is a fragile cake -- I've had trouble with the layers breaking and sliding off the mousse, but if you take your time and treat it with lots of care, the results are incredible.

This cake is certainly time consuming but it is defintely delicious! I made it for a birthday and everyone absolutely loved it. The peppermint mousse is fantastic. Be sure to adhere to the other reviewers suggestions though! I reduced the cream by 1/2 cup, and chilled the mousse and cake separately for 24 hours before assembling, then again for about 18 hours before adding the ganache. I had no problems at all with sliding, though the cake is crumbly so be sure to use parchment paper on the bottom as mentioned previously. If you have time and really want a great cake for a special occasion, this is your recipe.

The four forks rating is for taste, not ease or dependability. Tastes heavenly, but it's a lot of trouble. Thank you to everyone who wrote earlier reviews! I knew the mousse was a problem and reduced the hot cream by 1/2 cup. I also added 3 extra oz. of white chocolate to the mousse, and then chilled it for 7 hours. It came out very nice and firm but spreadable (also delicious!), and I chilled the cake after assembling each layer. The layers STILL slid around just a tad, though, and it was hard to keep the cake perfectly aligned so that the ganache would pour evenly down the sides. I myself wouldn't substitute the peppermint extract for the candies in the mousse, though -- the candies gave a beautiful and unexpected pink color to contrast with the fudge cake, and the texture was interesting. I decorated with chopped peppermint candies and marbled chocolate leaves; guests told me that it was the best cake they'd ever had, so I think it was worth it.

Rating: 1
Wow did this stink. Even after reading earlier comments, reducing the hot cream by 1/2c, whipping the stuff, and freezing the mint mousse, the filling was like soup at room temperature. Totally unusable as a filling. I used buttercream as a filling as the mousse soup as a sauce on each slice. And it tasted off. I would omit the sour cream entirely.

Rating: 3
This Cake was very good, the peppermint mousse set up well, after making adjustments of decreasing hot cream by 1/4 cup, and used 1 tsp peppermint extract. Cake was moist and yummy. The ganache was way to much, too rich, would have halved it or gone without with a light choclate glaze instead, however.

Rating: 4
I absolutely loved the taste of this cake, and got many compliments! The only problem I had was with the mousse filling - even after chilling for 24+ hours and freezing as I added the layers, the mousse wanted to squeeze out a little as I cut the cake. Did I do something wrong in preparing it? Other than that small issue, the mousse tasted FANTASTIC! I have been requested to make again. Awesome with a glass of cold milk.

This cake is awesome and worth the effort, but if you are looking for an easy and quick dessert to whip up, this recipe is not for you! The peppermint mousse is wonderful and light - have been trying to think of ways to use it in other desserts. Chill the mousse for at least 12 hours before putting it on the cake. When assembling, I wrapped a tall double layer of heavy duty tin foil around the edge of the first cake layer to create a "mold" tower. I then put on the mousse, and the second and third layers with no problem - the foil kept the mousse from oozing. I then chilled it for a full day to let it set before attempting to apply the ganache. This cake got rave reviews from all. A beautiful and scrumptious dessert for festive occasions.

Rating: 4
fabulous cake. I did chill the mousse overnight before constructing the cake. I should have chilled the layers too, but did not for fear they would dry out. I still had the oozy mousse problem others mentioned. Try reducing the hot cream for the mousse by 1/2 cup and whip the remaining cream until stiff. I also recommend the peppermint extract rather than crushed mints - better texture. However, the graininess of the crushed mints in the mousse is lost when it is layered in the cake. THe cake is very fragile - parchment paper lined pans are a must. I drizzled the layers with a total of a scant 1/2c simple syrup flavored with 2T peppermint schnapps to add more mint flavor. The ganache was not set enough for some reason. The proprotions for the ganache are correct - perhaps it was the "cheap" Nestles chocolate I used. Anyway, I chilled it briefly and whipped it. It worked and tasted fine, but was not the pretty dark glazed look I wanted. The whipped ganache did work to dam up the oozing mousse problem, so that unset ganache was a blessing in disguise. Best tasting cake I ever made and worth the hassles.

This is the perfect cake to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The peppermint mousse turned out wonderfully, as did the cake and ganache. I highly recomend this cake, you can't go wrong with chocolate and peppermint.

Put the bottom layer in a deep cake pan and top with the mousse, then freeze so the mousse becomes stiffer, then place next layer on top and freeze again. Now you will have a cake that is structurally sound enough to frost.

This is a most awesome cake. I have made it three times and think the cost and effort are worth it. I am not a novice baker, but this cake did present itself as a challenge. Please, if you are going to make this cake do not take any shortcuts. Even though the recipe does not state this, you NEED to chill the mousse and the cakes for 24 hours before you assemble them or you will be pulling your hair out in frustration. You also need to let the ganache cool for the recommended time to achieve best results. The final product will be stunning, not to mention the best tasting chocolate you have ever had. I have had rave reviews from every single person, in fact I am sure many thought I purchased it at a gourmet bakery.

This cake is fabulous but be forewarned.. read all of the other reviews and follow their advice. If you don't chill the mousse long enough, the cake will slide. As an extra preventative, I inserted toothpicks through the layers to encourage them to stay in place. I made this for a birthday and it was a huge hit. I will definitely make it again!

Make this cake at your own risk! Don't ignore the suggestions for using parchment in the baking pans; I did and had a mess in the kitchen. Also, you'll probably need to chill it more than the recipe suggests: I followed the directions and the mousse ran all over the place, too. Now I have one very ugly cake (had to buy a store cake -- it was intended for a birthday), a pile of cake crumbs from the first try, and mousse and ganache all over my kitchen. Sorry, Marcel -- I usually love your recipes but there are plenty of fabulous fancy chocolate cakes out there that don't cause as much aggravation as this one did.

I actually doubled the recipe for my husband's company potluck and for a Christmas luncheon. That afternoon I received emails from my husband's office asking for the recipe. It was delicious... I will use the cake recipe for other cakes and frostings. The ganache was excellent. The peppermint filling was great - it made alot and mine too turned pink - would be an excellent topping for ice cream. Plan ahead, the reviews are worth the efforts!

I also had no problems with the recipe. My cakes did not crack and turned out nicely, but I baked two thick layers in standard 9" cake pans and cut those into four thinner layers. My mousse was sort of pink, but I didn't care. It is good, but VERY rich. A little goes a long way.

Did this for Christmas and had no problems with it--but it did help that I'd read reviews and knew what to look out for. Chilled the mousse overnight, no problems with turning out the cake layers (did all 3) or assembly. Lots of ganache, though--very chocolately, but beautiful and festive. But you need to plan far enough ahead so you have enough time to let it chill at the various stages. Everyone loved it.

The cake tasted delicious but was difficult to assemble. I am fairly accomplished with baking however this recipe was challenging. The cake layers fell apart when I removed them from the pan. The candy also ran. The mousse was pink which was ok for a christmas cake. I would use parchment paper next time on the bottom of the pans to avoid the crumbling layers. I would probably try this recipe one more time to see if I could improve it with experience. I used chocolate curls and a couple of mints on the top for decoration. Looked quite nice.

I recently tried making this cake for a Christmas party, and it was a disaster. It tasted delicious, but te cake stuck to the pans, the mousse turned pink and ran out the sides when I tried to assemble - I never got to the ganache. Anyway, I have since tried it again, this time using buttered parchment paper in the cake pans. I froze the layers ahead of time for convenience and also because I thought it would help to assemble te cake when it's cold to help the mousse set up. I garnished the top with a ring of crushed peppermint candies and some mint sprigs. It looked very festive and tasted delicious. Everyone loved it. It's a good Christmas cake to have in your repertoire.

This is the best tasting chocolate cake I have ever made. I made it for my husband's birthday and our friends absolutely loved & relished it. I followed the recipe very closely and practised a lot of patience with the mousse and the ganache. The final product turned out just as I had expected. I took the advice of one of the previous reviewers and made two layers instead of three. That way it was easier to handle and prevent mess. I will make it again but only for a special occasion,expensive ingredients & time consuming.

It really helped that other bakers had rated this recipe beforehand, as I got a sense of what not to do when I tried it. I only made two layers and everything worked out beautifully, nothing stuck to the pan and none of the layers broke, in fact this was one of the best and easiest chocolate cake batters I've tried. Just be sure to bake it long enough. I had a lot more peppermint mousse than I needed, but no one in my house seemed to mind. Make sure the mousse is set when putting the layers together, it does tend to squelch out the sides. Also make sure the ganache is almost set before icing the cake - I was a little too eager and things got very messy. I made this for a birthday party and my friends - and all the people on the subway on my way to the party - were amazed by the cake, it's very impressive.

Very Nice cake, didnt try the peppermints as I too thought the red dye might run. I swapped out the crushed peppermints with 1 t (to taste) peppermint extract and assembled as directed. I added the crushed peppermints as a garnish to the plate and with a small pile on top with a mint leaf or two. Will make a great christmas cake. Thanks.

Tonight the cake was eaten and enjoyed by all. It tasted like a "peppermint pattie". I thought it was delicious but I would not make it again. The cost of making this is definitely not worth the results! After buying all that chocolate, I could have gone to a bakery and gotten something just as good at half the price. Not worth all that work! I added this part after reading the other reviewers comments. The cake also broke apart on me! When I tried to assemble it the layers also "slid" off! It has nothing to do with being a novice baker. I have been baking for years and never experienced such "problems" with a recipe. It can't be both of us. It MUST be the recipe! The mousse actually turned "pink" after adding the crushed candy which "bleed". After cutting the cake, I can say it looked nothing like Marcel's version!

The cake layers cracked when I tried to remove them from the pan, then when I tried to stack them with the mousse, they broke and slid apart and the mousse was splurting out the sides! A *complete* disaster. I wrapped it in plastic wrap and bought a cake instead. A couple days later, I tasted the cake before throwing it out, and ohmylordy! The best cake I've ever tasted!! And this was without the ganache even!! Never did make the ganache, but ate the entire messy blob of a cake and it was FANTASTIC!! I will definitely try it again--with the ganache this time--but I wish I knew how to put it together better without the layers breaking and sliding all over the place! I'm a beginner cook, so I guess I just need practice... ?
