Easy, but kind of boring overall. Would not make again.

Very suprising! The poblano peppers maintained spice through the steaming, and added hint of flavor that paired well with the stuffing. Paired well with grilled corn on the cob.

I liked this alot, but I also changed a few things. I cooked the tomatoes with the onions the whole time, and I added a habanero. I also added cumin and oregano. The meat was a mix of shredded chicken thighs and chopped chirizo that I had fried and drained. I mixed in shredded cheese and then I covered the slit with sliced cheese. My girlfriend flipped out. I would make this again for sure.

Very easy and tasty dish. I added green chili's, garlic, red pepper, cumin and a spanish seasoning which REALLY helped out. I also used a chipotle lime marinated chicken. I would not shy away from adding spices to this dish.

I thought these were good and I'd definitely make again. I think that a little seasoning would help--maybe cumin and oregano. Also, the poblanos packed more of a punch than I'd expected. I made this with the refried black beans--a nice accompaniment.

I used seasoned shredded chicken from the store because I had it on had in my freezer. Instead of the water and tomatos, I added 2 cans or Rotel...gave it the perfect kick. I would either add more cheese next time and let it melt on top, or leave it out altogether. The 2 1/2 oz called for is not enough to really notice...so why add the fat when you can't even taste it!

To add more flavor sautee', over medium heat, 1 T. minced garlic and add 2 boneless chicken breasts dusted with chili powder in 1 T. each of butter and oil. Cover pan during the last 5 mins. I also used pepper jack cheese and increased the amount I used. Adding 1/3 C. sour cream is delicious. Serve with your favorite spicy rice dish.

I liked this, but was not wowed by it. I didn't follow the advice of not blackening the peppers because I like them charred and smoky - do not rinse in water- and even though a few fell apart a bit, it was worth it. Can't put my finger on what is missing- possibly cornmeal somewhere...

This was very easy to make, I used extra cheese and enchilada sauce insted if plum tomatoes. It did take along time to make, but it was worth the wait.

I just love making this recipe in the summer when we get wonderful fresh poblano chiles. It is worth the time involved in roasting the chiles over my gas burner. It has relatively few ingredients and is easy to prepare. A winner !!

I have made this a few times now and love it. I spice it up by using monteray jack cheese with jalapenos. Sometimes I make it with cooked shrimp instead of chicken which is delicious and I usually serve it with black beans and brown rice. I garnish the plates with sour cream sprinkled with chives which works well with the peppers and black beans.

I loved the filling, hated the poblanos. Maybe I didn't roast them enough. I think next time I try this, I'll just go the easy route and use canned whole chiles.

I made these for friends and they were very well received. To spice them up, I made the sauce from the chicken and green olive enchilada recipe on this site and mixed one cup into the filling (I increased the recipe to make 12 peppers) and poured the rest over the pepper before serving. I also replaced the jack cheese with queso blanco. When I complained to my husband about all the roasting, peeling, and seeding he protested "Oh, but they're so good."

This dish was very tasty. I added the chipotles like other reviewers suggested. I don't think the dish would have been as tasty without them. A couple of the chiles came out SUPER HOT! But you can't really tell when you buy them if they will be hot or not. My boyfriend liked them, so I'll make them again. Next time I'll use mexican cheese instead of jack in the filling. Oh, I also doubled the cheese amounts.

This was a great way to use leftover bbq-ed chicken. As per other comments, I added a little jalapeno and two chipotles in adobo. This was too spicy though -- and I am asian! Next time, I will omit the jalapeno. Very yummy.

I followed the suggestion of others and added chipotle and chorizo to the mix; it was very spicy but quite flavorful. (This was my first attempt cooking with chipotles - I like spicy food but I didn't realize how hot they were... Yow!) I also added some corn kernels (I had a leftover ear) and thought that was a colorful addition, although it didn't add to flavor much.

These stuffed poblanos are just amazing! The first time I made these, I actually added a few tablespoons of sour cream to the chicken mixture. I felt it gave an extra umph! The only time consuming part of this dish is cleaning the inside of the peppers after they are roasted. Well worth it!

I just learned to roast and peel peppers, and was anxious to try something new (I have chili rellenos down pat). This one is WONDERFUL !! I used a 14 1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes, drained, instead of plum tomatoes, and added 2 Tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro. This is really a treat ! I serve them with refried beans, and Mexican rice, along with shredded cabbage and diced tomatoes -- flour tortillas and salsa round out the meal ! We LOVE Juana's poblanos !!

I had clipped this recipe and found it when I was looking for something to do with fresh poblanos. The reviews convinced me to try it. It was a hit and would definitely make it again. Much fresher and lighter tasting than fried versions. I did double the cheese as the chiles were fairly large. Also added a bit of chopped fresh jalapena to the onion and chipotle in adobe with the tomato. Definitely not bland or boring. Served with refried beans, mexican rice and guacamole, wonderful meal.

Awesome dish! Leveraging the advice of the previous commentators, I added chipotle to the stuffing, and, because we really enjoy spicy food, we added a fresh Jalapeno pepper to the mix. To get things kicked off on the right foot, Given that there were no specific instructions for preparing the chicken, I marinated the chicken in cilantro, tequila, lime juice, salt, and pepper for one hour, then grilled it on the BBQ.

I heeded advice and wore rubber gloves to handle peppers. This was the only area where I encountered problems, as I had difficulty removing all of the skin from the peppers. I may not have blistered the peppers enough due to trying not to let them blacken so will take this into consideration next time. I also added the chipotle peppers and a little cumin. I think that they tasted even better the next day, so I would agree that they could be made ahead and would actually recommend it.

I used tofu instead of chicken to make it even lower in fat and it worked beautifully! Make sure to wear gloves when you work with the poblanos. My fingers were burning the rest of the night! It's great to make a few hours ahead and keep in the fridge until your ready to heat them. This one is a keeper!

I made this with red chile rice when we had friends over for cinqo de mayo and was told this was the best Mexican meal they'd ever had. I heeded posted advice though and kicked it up with a maggi chicken cube, diced broiled chorizo sausage and minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. It definitely is a keeper!

Here you go--I heeded the prior reviews that it was "bland" so I kicked it up by adding some chipotle chilies AND a little chorizo--that did the trick! I was home alone for the evening, had ONE poblano pepper in fridge and some leftover chicken and an open can of chipotle chilies in fridge from a previous meal...so I roasted my poblano under broiler, prepared the onion and chicken mixture, adding one chipotle chili finely chopped and about a half of a finely chopped chorizo...stuffed that into my roasted pepper, baked in oven as directed and--mmmmm! Nice and spicy and delicious. (too bad I was home alone that evening!!!) I added a little sour cream and cilantro after it came out of the oven. I guess for a recipe for eight people, you'd want to add maybe two or three finely chopped chipotles and one whole chorizo. Epicurious has me hooked on poblanos!

this recipe was edible but as others have said very very bland! I even spiced it up with some cumin and salsa. My guests enjoyed it but I was disappointed, especially with the time it took to prepare the poblanos for stuffing.

This dish was quite easy to make, once we had the peppers charred. The chicken and cheese balance well with the heat of the peppers. I also added some hot sauce and a dollop of fat-free sour cream as garnish. For an Easterner's tastebuds, this is a great twist on an old Southwestern recipe.I am making this again!

This was easy to prepare and makes a nice presentation with bubbly, browned cheese. I thought it was tasty if a little bland. The Chef thought it was good but way too bland. If you like your food a little spicier, you should add some chili pepper in the stuffing mixture or make a spicy sauce to pour over.
