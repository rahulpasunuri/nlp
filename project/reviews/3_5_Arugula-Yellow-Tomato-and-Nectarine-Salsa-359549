I didn't measure and made some changes to this recipe, but the idea of nectarine salsa, especially on top of grilled meat, is great. I've had watermelon and mango salsas like this before, but I think I like nectarine the best.

Yum! If your mouth doesn't tolerate spicy things well, I'd suggest either halving the serrano chile or omitting it completely. Other than that, this recipe is an easy and decicious one! I served it on some sourdough bread and everybody loved it!

Superb as is, but on a second go-round, I added a twist. On a toasted slice of bruschetta, I added a thin slice of fried halloumi cheese. Heaven on earth!

This was pretty tasty. I doubled the recipe but only used one pepper because I was worried about the spice. Turns out I should have added the second pepper. It was better the second day after the flavours blended although it got a bit liquidy. Served it on baguette with goat cheese as suggested and it was very nice. Next time I will add some sweet onion and maybe use cilantro instead of the arugula.

This was SO easy, and SO good - as good as the best fruit/peach/mango-ey salsa I've ever purchased. I added a couple pinches of xylitol (or whatever sweetener you use) just to heighten the sweetness even a teeny bit more. It was super summery and perfect!
