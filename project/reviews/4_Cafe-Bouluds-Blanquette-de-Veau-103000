This stew was delicious, not too heavy, not too light; not to spicy, but really flavorful. Takes a little effort, but would be easier doing it the second time. Really good!

We have a French exchange student staying with us and he told us blanquette de veau is his favorite meal. So I made this recipe for him on his birthday. He said it was just as good as his mom's (maybe he was being polite but he had 3 servings and finished it off). Everyone in the family loved it. Delicious! Definitely a keeper. The only thing I changed is I used leeks and parsnips instead of green beans (I just liked the idea of earthy root vegetables) and I used red pearl onions. When the liquid evaporated from the vegetables, everything started to caramelize a bit. Yummy!

I made this recipe especially for a friend. It was terrific; actually he said it was the best he ever had; no small compliment! The only thing I tweaked was to add some veal demi glace to the sauce to enhance the flavors. Everyone raved about it. This recipe is a keeper!!!

This was just plain blah. The white sauce is very good, but the boiled veal and vegetables had no flavor. There is a much better (and easier) "Blanquette De Veau" recipe on this site from Bon Appetit "Too Busy to Cook".

Question to the cooks: Why boil the veal in water for 4 minutes and rinse before boiling in the chicken stock?

Boring! I use these same ingredients all the time in other dishes but following this recipe exactly resulted in my dullest dinner to date. This was a waste of good veal; there are far more flavorful dishes out there on this website.

I have been using epicurious for so long, and only now have I felt so compelled to write a review! I know there are already plenty of raves, but seriously...This recipe is composed of simple, familiar ingredients but it is truly exceptional. I replaced the pearl onions with leeks, and the celery root with turnips. I did not include the green beans. I recommend using the leeks, they unravel and absorb beautifully into the stew. The meat was tender, incredibly flavorful, and a showstopper at my dinner party. I will make this for future dinner parties, as well as family Sunday lunches.

Oh my!!! This is a fantastic recipe. Absolutely delicious. Just as it is written...I will make this again and again.

Phenomenal. Tip: Don't let the small amount of liquid with the vegetables throw you. If you add more liquid, the cream sauce will be too thin. I made 4.5 pounds of veal and froze the remaining portions. To reheat: Defrost in the fridge. Put in an all metal saucier pan. Cover at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes.

This was delicious. I could only get "veal stew" meat @ WholeFoods so no clue what it was, but it took longer than 30 mins at very low simmer to get tender. I ignored all instructions on the stock, just went by visual. Used frozen peas instead of beans...sweeter taste seemed right with this. A really beautiful, delicate dish perfect for this spring day.

used veal shanks instead of shoulder. also had trouble finding some of the other ingredients, but it wound up tasting better than anything i have ever made. i even overcooked the vegetables.

This was awesome. I followed it exactly, except I used all of the chicken stock that I cooked the veal in or it would not have been "saucy" enough, just add more flour to the sauce. I used snap peas. My husband raved about it and I asked him if he was going to lick his plate!

Had good old Australian Lamb on hand. It cooked beautifully, fell apart in tender chunks. The flavour was delicious and I served it with basic mashed potato. Will be a great winter dish. Had a little left over so made some mini pies for lunch the next day. Not a spoonful was wasted

This was great and everyone loved it. It was a pleasure to cook.

Authentic and excellent. Made it several times using vegetables on hand but the celery root, pearl onions and mushrooms are a must. I usually omit the cream to keep it light and it still has that lusciously rich texture.

I've made this recipe several times, and it is by far the best blanquette recipe that I've found. It is rich but subtle, delicate, and a real treat. You can vary the vegetables depending on the "audience". Even the left-overs -- when there are any - are sublime. This has become my standard.

Absolutely divine! The taste is decidedly French. Serve this to guests and they'll believe they're in a French bistro. The dish has chicken broth but very little cream in it, so the richness referred to is more perception than reality. The preparation is simple and quick. Try this take on French comfort food.

This is a great blanquette recipe! I used a pressure cooker to cook the veal (10 minutes total!) and used potatoes instead of turnips. I didn't have haricot verts so I just omitted them and used dried porcinis instead of fresh buttons. Served it with brown rice. My husband, who is French, loved it and even said it was better than his (French) sister-in-laws blanquette de veau!

I thought this was very nice and especially liked the combination of vegetables. The flavor is very delicate, which is typical for a blanquette. I thought it needed a bit more lemon juice. Next time I might go back to my standard blanquette recipe, but I would definitely add the vegetables from this recipe.

Okay, I refuse to pay $9 lb. for veal to test a recipe, so I tried it instead with Australian lamb, which I can get for 3.80 lb. OH YEAH!!!! We can do this! Over, and over, and over, and over. Not only do I plan to do the veal, but also less expensive cuts of roast, chicken, rabbit, goat, maybe even duck or buffalo! I did substitute potatoes for the turnips as we don't care for them, and next time I want to try adding fennel. Get this! When I don't have enough left-overs for another meal -- I'm making pot pies with it!!

We loved this recipe and my wife, who doesn't eat veal even loved it with just the vegetables. It IS rich but perfect for the weather we've been having.

We found this to be rather bland and not worth the effort. Nothing special at all.

The sauce was delicious but very, very rich. I think next time I may de-fat the broth after poaching the veal and before adding the liquid to the sauce. I used tiny peas instead of the green beans. Otherwise, the haunting, subtle taste of the celeriac has motivated me to find additional ways to prepare this intriguing vegetable. My children were amused by how the hideously ugly celery root was transformed into a sublime delight, a life lesson, indeed!

Yummy to the extreme.
