Classic Korean comfort recipe. I use a higher percentage of Ginger to make it stronger. You can always weaken it with a little hot water. It's also refreshing iced. A mug of this (strong) with honey in the late evening works WONDERS for congestion in the winter. It heats the blood, so to speak, and you feel great afterwards. If you even feel the tiniest scratchiness in your throat, this tea will head it off at the pass.

This version is simply not strong enough for a great ginger tea. My preference is to use 4-6 slices of candied or fresh ginger, 2 cinnamon sticks, 2-3 whole cloves, 2 Tbs dry white wine, 1/4 tsp lemon zest, & juice of 1/2 lemon. Pour 2 cups boiling water over and let steep for at least 15 minutes, though you get better flavor if you let it set at least 30 minutes and re-heat in the microwave to drinking temperature. (It then has lovely strong cinnamon flavor and solid warming ginger flavor, with hints of clove) Sieve out solids and add 1 Tbs honey per cup to sweeten. Great restorative, good for the throat & whole digestive tract. If you like more ginger flavor, use fresh & grate or chop into smaller pieces, but digestive benefits will also come from using candied ginger. If you like less cinnamon flavor, use 1 stick or remove sticks after 15 minutes. You can also achieve better spice flavor (in a shorter time) by lightly toasting cinnamon & cloves, then letting spices set a few minutes with the white wine before adding other ingredients & hot water. For presentation, serve with cinnamon sticks or lemon slices, with candied ginger on the side for nibbling.

I make my own ginger-lemon tea thus: Grate one large gingerroot and cut a whole lemon into approximately 1" chunks and place in large glass measuring cup or pitcher. Pour over 4 cups of hot water and steep for 20-30 minutes. To use: dilute to taste, sweeten to taste; I prefer honey.
