My husband prepared this dish for us using oysters from South Carolina waters. He didn't use the lardo, but added a sprinkle of parmesan cheese; it was delicious..hoping to serve again unfortunately, we are back up north and won't have the same quality oysters as we did down south, fingers crossed for a good result.
