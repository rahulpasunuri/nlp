Short-grain rice. How can you go wrong? Make it all the time...only three forks because it is only rice, after all.

Au contraire, SF cook. The recipe uses short grain rice, which inherently makes sticky rice. Long grain rice normally used by many Westerners (especially in the Midwest and East Coast, and dare I mention Uncle Ben's?) is the non-sticky, loose particle rice that is not so easy to pick up with chopsticks. Perhaps you meant sushi rice? That also uses short grain rice, and gets seasoning from rice vinegar, etc.

This is a recipe for rice, not for sticky rice. How lame.
