Very good recipe. I subbed TJ's soy chorizo and omitted the cheese to make it vegan. Served with rice/beans/corn... yummm...

Nice change from a typical taco. We used Soyrizo instead. Would also recommend swapping out the feta with cotija if you can find it. Added chopped cilantro as well.

I have been making these tacos for almost 4 years now. The spicy chorizo plays off of the sweet yams, and red onions pickled in lime juice add a delightfully mild crunch. All in all it's a wonderful array of flavors and textures. If you have a little extra time, try substituting roasted butternut squash cubes (1/2") for the yams and swap out feta for aged white cheddar. http://michaelbeyer.me/2012/11/17/chorizo-butternut-tacos/

This recipe is in regular rotation at my house. Chorizo can be high in calories so sometimes I swap in spicy chicken sausage and it's almost as tasty as the chorizo.

So good, so easy and so imperative to get a good quality chorizo. I prefer the Columbian variety. A keeper!

okay, um YUM!!! And really easy! Instead of chorizo I used cajun- style pork sausage which paired very nicely with the sweetness of the yams. Also, as one reviewer suggestion, I didn't microwave the yams (that didn't sound good), so I roasted them in the oven for 30 minutes (drizzled some olive oil & salt/pepper). I also added yellow zucchini & fresh garlic to the saute. And the lime-marinated red onion makes this dish so good...definitely will make this again (you can even omit the sausage & just go veggie style)...

A pasilla is a different chili that is dried, a dried poblano is called an ancho chili.

I found this recipe by accident. I was looking for shrimp fajitas, and found this instead. My husband is a pechetarian so we didn't go exactly by the recipe. We had Trader Joes Soy Chorizo in the fridge. We had jalapenos instead of pablanos. (Still havenb't been able to find Pablanos), we had all the rest of the ingredients so I tried it. We go back to it over and over. LOVE IT!! Can be vegan if you want it to be. We have used cheddar or sourcream instead of feta, but lately we've used no cheese and it's still delicious!

This is a good recipe, however, not as fantastic as so many reviewers thought. I made it as written and I think it would be good to substitute crema/sour cream for the feta cheese next time. I definitely will make it again.

So super yummy! I would normally never consider cooking sweet potatoes in the microwave, thinking they would be bland but since they get mixed in with the chorizo and poblanos, there is no need to worry about blandness. The lime-marinated onions are fantastic and really make the dish. What's morethis is super easy!

Really good. My kids loved it. The marinated onions are key to the complexity, so would not suggest omitting.

Just made this for the first time (as is written). Easy to make after work, we all loved it and other than chorizo there's some good nutrition to boot. This will be a regular on menu planning.

The visual on this is amazing but not so much for the taste. Was very disappointed in the final outcome and would suggest a cilantro cream or something to pack a little more punch. Did use fresh chorizo but would consider getting a spicier version at one of my latino markets next time. The yams are great, just don't overcook. I baked them, peeled when 3/4 of the way done, returned to oven for a short time, and cut and placed in ice bath to prevent overcooking and color change.

This was soooo good! I added a jalepeno with the poblano's for a little kick. I also use reduced fat sour cream/lime juice/garlic salt as a little sauce on over the mix once it was on the whole wheat tortilla. I will make this again and again!!!

I love this recipe. The only problem is that it's hard to find poblano chiles.

This recipe is awesome! I hate sweet potatoes, but love them in this meal. I've made it 3 times in the past 2 months, and still haven't had enough.

Seriously, one of the best things I have ever made. I was a little suspicious of the ingredient combo at first, but upon the first bite... nothing but love.

I love, love, love this recipe. It's delicious, colorful, unusual, and easy. I don't have a microwave so I toss the yams with a little olive oil and roast them in the oven.

I just made these again and they are really good and pretty quick and easy to make. I did make one addition. I find the yam and feta a little dry so I added lime juice and cumin to some sour cream and drizzled it over the chorizo mixture before the onions. I think it really improves the texture.

This was excellent, what a wonderful and unique taste. A friend made this recipe for our Once a Month Cooking Club. She actually used sweet potato fries in place of the yams to save time since she was making 6 entrees at a time. Still delicious! I will make this again and again. Wonderful.

This was fabulous, especially for how quick it was. Followed the recipe exactly. I was worried the poblanos would be too hot, but they mellow quite a bit. The only thing I changed was sprinkling fresh lime juice on the fajitas instead of the marinade. This will stay in my rotation.

I make this at least once a month. I use a vegetarian chorizo (like "Soyrisa" and keep everything else as is. Easy, fast and healthy. I keep forgetting to buy the poblano chili and have to run to the market. But hey, the sacrifices we make.

excellent. i don't have a microwave, so i used a ridged grill pan to grill the sweet potato (not yams, please) and the poblano. otherwise, exactly as published. great fajitas.

Made this last night and the whole house loved it. Used goat cheese rather than feta because it's what I had on hand. Even the three year old had two. My DH raved. We thought the chorizo gave perfect seasoning to the yams and the red onions with the lime and salt were a perfect touch. Wouldn't change a thing, it was delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes on the site. I wouldn't change a thing either. I feel like the flavors were intense and delicious but not overwhelming. Delicious!

This quick and easy recipe was a huge hit both times I made it. The flavor combination is sensational -- don't change a thing!

I was really excited to try this recipe, but I was disappointed with the outcome. It was surprisingly bland. Because most of the seasoning comes from the chorizo, I might try it again using more chorizo relative to the veggies. Could also try roasting the poblanos and/or adding some spices. But probably will just move on to other fajita recipes...

This was a wonderful blend of flavors. It was easy and wonderful. I cur the yams even thinner and added more lime juice to beable to serve over all the fajitas. We will be doing this again and again

Very Tasty! Made it for a New Years appetizer, and put it in little Tostitos scoops for a bit size option... a big hit!

Delicious! I used soy chorizo and goat cheese instead of feta. I also added a jalapeno for a bit more heat. These are quick and very tasty!

Great recipe, I was pleasantly surprised by the combination and I used andouille sausage instead of chorizo. It was quick to throw together and I will definitely make it again

Fantastic recipe. The perfect blend of spice from the Poblano and chorizo, salt from the feta, tang from the lime and subtle sweetness from the yams. We will make this again.
