Excellent way to prepare game. I covered the pheasant and cooked for only 40 minutes total (used a meat thermometer). I will use every time my husband hunts.

Excellent! I have prepared this twice and on my third for our traditional "game night" dinner the evening before Thanksgiving. For leftovers, shread pheasant and make a ragu with sauce, serve over fried polenta or grits!

Yuk -- pheasant was moist but sauce completely overpowered it. Sauce was way too sweet and using Grand Marnier in it was a total waste because the flavor didn't come through at all. Worst dish I've ever made off epicurious and I would have given it a rating of less than one if I could. I will definitely not be making this again.

My wife has always been skeptical of the pheasant I bring home from my hunts-- worried it would be too dry. We picked this recipie together and it was a hit. Some pieces were more tender than others, but the taste was great. We subbed OJ for the grand marnier--I would add more figs and fewer apricots next time.

Will take some perfecting to get the pheasants done but still tender and not dry. Are pheasants naturally tender or tough? Is roasting the best way to prepare them? The flavors in general were good. We covered skinless breasts with sage leaves and bacon, then did everything else as directed. Tasty but somewhat tough.

LOVE THE APRICOT SAUCE! I used 3 skinless pheasant breasts and I think the cooking time was a little long. Also, I should have taken the other reviewer's advice and covered them while they were cooking. They were pretty dry and tasteless, but the sauce was the redeeming feature. I used orange juice and no dates, but it was fabulous. I'll probably try this again with the other two breasts in the freezer, but will not actively search out more pheasant.

The apricots in the sauce plus the fat in the sauce gave the birds a lot of very good flavor. The birds did require more time to cook than indicated though. I would make this recipe again.

Quick and easy receipe. I roasted one domisticated ring-necked pheasant with the legs. The apricot sauce is incredible. I want to try it with duck or plain old chicken!

Excellent -- a wonderful blend of flavors! My husband was very pleased (and he is rather particular about the way the pheasant he brings home from a hunt is prepared!) Will definitely make again!

Wonderful!!!!! I substituted dried tart cherries for the dates. My guests loved this (and so did the children)!! Will certainly make again as soon as I have more pheasant available.

A good easy recipe. I did not have any dates on hand, and it was fine without them. We will definitely make this again.

The pheasant was incredible! It was very moist and flavorful. I substituted orange juice for the grand marnier and added extra wine.

I made this EXACTLY as specified for Valentine's Day, and my boyfriend FINALLY declared me a better cook than his mother and grandmother. Since then, every restaurant meal he gets is rated "not as good as your pheasant." I'm making it again this weekend for his surprise birthday dinner. TRY IT!

I added white figs, raisins and used only marsala and orange juice instead of wine etc. It was really good!

My guests fell to their knees and sang my praises to the heavens. This one must be put on the restaurant menu.

This was a huge hit at my last dinner party! Everyone loved it. It was very nice with wild rice which balanced the sweetness of the dish. Since my husband actually hunted these pheasants and they were sans skin and low in fat, I cooked them with the lid on the pan and they were very moist. Also, I left the legs on and they were wonderful for guests with larger appetites.

This recipe may be fine as stated, but I had to prepare 8 pheasants for my dinner, and they turned out a bit on the dry side. I plan to try one of the other pheasant recipes next time.
