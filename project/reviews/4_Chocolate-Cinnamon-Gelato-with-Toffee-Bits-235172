I brought this to a party and my friend said it was the best ice cream she had ever tasted. Ill definitely be making this again!

Sweet heaven, this is amazing! Uh-may-zing! I didn't put the candy in, and I really don't think it needed it. I served it for Thanksgiving with pumpkin pie and homemade Amarula whipped cream. The combo was fan-frickin-tastic. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate. This recipe has secured a safe place in the permanent holiday repertoire.

wow! delicious. didn't have toffee candy so didn't put it in, but the chocolate/cinnamon combination is unbelievably good. it definitely needs to be chilled after being made in the machine. the extra time, I think, gives the cinnamon time to really shine through. I used Sharffen Berger 70% Bittersweet chocolate. From the 9.7 oz bar, I used three of the blocks.

Fantastic!!

I followed the recipe exactly and produced a very rich gelato that I thought tasted quite good. I added toffee bits and mini chocolate chips (1/3 cup each), which added nice texture. I will certainly make this recipe again - it's tough to find an ice cream recipe that doesn't call for eggs.

Great recipe. I'm a huge fan of cinnamon, but I probably will use a little less next time. It's all in what you prefer. The Heath bar bits were a nice little crunchy addition. I'm sure I'll be making this again!

There are a lot of good ice cream recipes on here, but this one is truly spectacular.

This was also my first time to make gelato, and it was divine. I love cinnamon, so the amount in the recipe was perfect. I used both Callebaut bittersweet and semi-sweet (about 4 oz bittersweet to 1 oz semi-sweet) which made a delicious dark chocolate base, almost like a truffle. I did sub half-and-half for the heavy cream, but it is still incredibly rich and creamy. Next time, I will probably increase the toffee to 1/2 c as my family loves toffee, but this recipe is perfect as is. I had no problems with iciness in following days. My only complaint is that it is so rich that I can't eat more than two spoonfuls!

Delicious! This was the first recipe I tried with my new ice cream maker and it was a great start. Followed the recipe exactly and it was very simple. I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate for the base and then I used Lindt toffee. Next time I would try Heath or Skor bars, as the Lindt was missing some of the salt I like in other toffees. The only reason this recipe gets 3 instead of 4 forks from me is that after freezing for 24 hours it developed an iciness that was not so good. I think others below have mentioned this, too. But the flavor was so wonderful I would definitely make this again!

First time making gelato and it was so yummy!!! Very easy, and sooo good. Rich and creamy and very much like gelato I have had out. Not as good as I had in France but very very close. Made with an ice cream maker and then froze for a few hours and it was great!

My first gelato recipe.Very easy and nice thick texture... I used Sharfenberger semisweet (62%) and it was very good.. used amt cinnamon called for. Faint hint taste in final product but well balanced.. Carmelized pecans would go well so will try if I make this again. Much denser than other icecreams i've made in my KitchenAid IceCream attchmt..

This was my first time making this and the family really enjoyed it. I used Skor candy and would make this again:)

Wow, this was amazing. I'm a bit of a fat-phobe, so I stuck to whole milk rather than the cream, and it was still fantastic and definitely creamy enough!

i used semi-sweet chocolate. I think it would be better without the toffee. But I loved the texture.

Oh WOW! Others were right- this is "the " gelato recipe!!! I am ready to open a gelato store after this--it is the best! I made EXACTLY as printed and it was perfet. After making it though, I can see experimenting with pecans and other ingredients. This is a recipe you must try!

Wonderful and so easy. I blended raspberries and pressed them through a sieve and added them to the mix before the chocolate. Amazing! This is the new base for gelato in my machine. I think you need to evaluate how strong your particular brand/age of cinnamon is to determine how much to add. Different brands are vastly different in strength. Overall, easy, quick and delightful!!

Everything needed to be upped a little. The cinnamon was so faint it was barely noticlbe. I added an additional 1/8 C sugar, 2 oz. chocolate, and 2 t cinnamon. You can even add this after it cools down. Stick a spoon in and taste, then adjust to your tastes. OVerall, great flavor and a wonderful texture. A big hit with everyone.

I recently made this gelato to the delight of my family. At the suggestion of other reviews, I cut back on the cinnamon (3/4 tsp) and wish I hadn't. You can BARELY taste the cinnamon, so it basically just tastes like chocolate gelato. It is still very tasty, though, and pretty easy to make.

By far the best use of my icecream maker to date.

This is delicious and a delightful combination of flavors that work well together. I used 1/4 c. 2% and 1 3/4c. of half and half instead of the stated 2 cups milk and it was just fine. I mixed bittersweet and semisweet as well.

This was so good. I used 2% milk and then added heavy cream. Just b/c that was all I had. I added candied pecans again, b/c I did not have toffee. I think my cinnamon was too old, could have used more. But I will make this again and again. So simple.

This gelato is delicious! Even though I made it with skim milk (entirely!), it was still fantastic. To compensate, slightly reduced the sugar and the chocolate...but not the toffee bits! Also, perhaps because my cinnamon was not very strong (pre-ground), I increased the cinnamon 3X...and it still wasn't overpowering.

Do not ever try any other chocolate Gelato, this one ie the one and only. Caramelized pecans are a must. Spectacular

This is the most fabulous, delectable gelato I have ever tasted. I have made this 3 times for company and receive rave reviews every time. I don't even have leftovers. I use half and half instead of all the steps for cream/ milk and it cuts down on time.

This is the best gelato ever, following suggestion from other readers, just 3/4 teaspoon cinnammon was just right. Instead of the toffee I added caramelised pecans you have to try it. Its to die for

Excellent! I used 1 tsp cinnamon, perfect. My husband's new favorite!

Fanstastic gelato; the cinnamon is a great addition, but we found 3/4 tsp to be plenty. It's difficult to think of anything else when this is in the freezer!

So rich, creamy, and tasty! We loved the texture and it came out smooth even in my old Cuisinart. I would rank 4 forks but went with 3 because I prefer the cinnamon at 1t or even 3/4t for the best results. Def a keeper, though!

The cinnamon was over-powering. I would suggest cutting back on it if you try this recipe. Also - I didn't get a great texture - dense but also kind of icy. I made it in my brand new Cuisinart Supreme commercial quality machine so I'm sure the churning was right. It was like a pudding before freezing. I think I actually liked it better when I tasted it warm.

The cinnamon flavor actually grows on you! The more we ate, the more we liked it. I only used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and I added some chocolate chips. I think I might cut the cinnamon down to 3/4 teaspoon next time. It also needs more toffee.

Wow this is rich and so tasty. It has a very luxurious texture almost like a ganache. It was very easy to make as well. Next time, I will double the recipe if making for guests.

a little too much cinnamon for my liking but still good. A very nice texture for how easy it was to make.

My husband loves these two flavors together and thought this was perfect. I actually added a little extra cinnamon and chocolate to make it extra special. My own personal preference would be to make this as an ice cream over a gelato, but that's just me.

Excellent gelato. I love the flavor of chocolate and cinnamon together, and the toffee is a nice touch. I will cut the cinnamon back a little next time - personal preference, but I would like it a little more subtle. But overall, extremely easy and tasty!

This gelato is soooo good. Simple and easy. I like toffee but next time, I'd like to try it w/ toasted chopped hazelnuts. A winner!

Best ice cream ever! Rave reviews by all who partook!

This gelato recipe is absolutely divine! I added hazelnuts just because I wanted a little crunch. It's rich, creamy, chocolatey and a bad thing to make when you're pregnant (like I am) because I just can't put it down. I would highly recommend it.
