We made this for Thanxgiving last year and it proved to be one of the most favorite dishes to the guests. I tend to aggressively spice so it ended up being a bit too strong for some feeble palates, but everyone else enjoyed it thoroughly. I will be making this recipe again as one of the 2 planned stuffings for this Thanksgiving. Very tasty recipe.

Being a Southerner I have a natural gravitation towards corn bread, so I was really excited about this updated stuffing. Of course it all begins with great cornbread, and the writers have done an admirable job with their methodology. What I found to be really interesting was that this is essentially "Mexican Cornbread", cornbread mixed with chili peppers and topped with cheese. Which is absolutely one of my favorite cornbreads. Thanks for the inventive adaptation.

This stuffing was delicious. I made the recipe as shown but substituted Aleppo pepper for the dried New Mexico chili (which I didn't have). I think next time I'd cut the butter by 25% to ease my conscience. I plan to make it again for Christmas.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. Exactly as shown. It was THE most delicious stuffing I've ever made and I had rave reviews from not only my Thanksgiving guests but those rifling through my refrigerator the following day. The cornbread itself is nothing to write home about alone, but, it makes this recipe. The chili combo is perfect.

Do you people(yes, you! the ones leaving reviews)actually cook? There is nothing confusing in this recipe! Masa the recipe refers to is Masa Harina Flour and can be bought in most grocery stores now. (There is NO mention of masa dough anywhere) The FLOUR is placed in the oven to lightly brown it BEFORE making the cornbread. Before you write quasi-angry, negative reviews... make sure you know what YOU are doing. And no, I have not made this recipe yet, though I did print it out today to use at Christams, as I think it sounds amazing.

Where we live (northern CA), masa is NOT "corn dough for making tortillas." It is a bag of special corn flour (called masa - it says so right on the package!) that you mix with water to make "instant dough" for things like tortillas and tamales. Therefore, if the recipe writer meant for us to use the pre-made dough as opposed to buying MASA (the flour, which, btw does NOT make sense in the recipe, unless she intended for us to toast it!), she should have made herself clear. Please do so, Bon Appetit! Now if anyone DID use the dough, please explain how drying it out in the oven helps the recipe. Thank you.

Too many chiles in this recipe. You never mix chiles that don't marry well. If you are using Polblanos you don't need Jalapenos or New Mexico. Most importantly,no black pepper. Poblanos are NOT AKA dried pasillas. Dried Poblanos are chiles ANCHO. Masa is corn dough for making corn tortillas. It comes in a flour called nixtamal in Mexican grocery stores or you can buy masa by the kilo in tortilla stores

I fixed this stuffing as a side dish for cornish game hens and it turned out great. So easy because you don't have to roast and peel the peppers. I weighed the peppers to make sure I had the correct amount and I used all 4 jalapenos. Everyone agreed that it was a very flavorful stuffing. Thanks BA!
