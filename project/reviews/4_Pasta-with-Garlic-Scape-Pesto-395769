Delicious! Made as per the recipe. Has more bite than regular basil pesto. I look forward to more scapes next summer!

Loved this. Never knew I could use my garlic tops! Added a 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves and 1/2 cup milk. Awesome. This iis compelling me to plant more garlic!!

I think if I were to make this again I'd steam the scapes first. I tried to quadruple the recipe as my hubby picked the entire crop the afternoon before we're leaving for holidays, so my poor Vitamix overheated trying to mash everything up. I added cream to tonight's dinner as one reviewer suggested and the pesto was quite delicious. I froze the other 4 baggies for future use.

I made the pesto for a pasta salad and yes the pesto itself was very strong but after I added it to the salad, it had a great flavor. I get a lot of scopes from my CSA share and this is a great way to use them.

This definitely has a very strong garlic flavor - and my family and I enjoy a lot of garlic. I had to add more cheese and oil and in the end I threw in some spinach and parsley to cut down the bite. But a good way to use garlic scapes.

Simpicity at it's best! What a wonderful way to use scapes!

This was pretty good. Definitely a great way to use up some garlic scapes. For the sake of flavor, I had to add more parmesan. And because it needed dairy to cut the super spicy/prominent garlic flavor I added about a 1/4 cup cream. As in other reviews, I found it to be a bit dry, so that was why I decided to add the liquid (milk) and added about 2 tbsp more oil. Overall, a good starting spot to create a recipe to your own taste.

Just made this with wonderful results. Some may find the flavor quite strong, so a tip is to freeze the pesto as this mellows the flavor a little. Dinner tonight!! Cheers!

I just received my first CSA share and had 4 garlic-scapes. I had no idea what to do with them and was happy to find this recipe. The flavor is amazing (bright, fresh and a little spicy) and the recipe is so easy. I halved the ingredients except for the oil--the pesto turned out dry, so I doubled the oil. A lovely recipe, I heartily recommend!

Great recipe with few ingredients - I substituted raw almonds because my husband is allergic to pistachios. I think the almonds must be drier as I had to almost double the olive oil. I had cut the recipe in half, however, because just two of us were eating. I will make it again soon as I have about 20-30 more scapes in my garden.

Surprisingly good for such a simple recipe. We don't do dairy, so no parm for this gal, AND it came out GREAT. A keeper for sure.

I found it odd the organic stores to no carry garlic scapes, but I wa so excited because every single booth at the Farmers Market had them This is delicious. I live in Albuquerque, so go to your Farmers Market in Alamogordo,

To: A Cook from Alamogordo. Have you wanted to make fried chicken but didn't have any chicken. Then you make something else that's as good but isn't fried chicken. If a recipe has 4 key ingredients and is named for the major one, it won't be the same with a substitution for that item. Why not just make a regular pesto until you come across garlic scapes. Like many Italian recipes, it's not about buying expensive and exotic rarities. While quite good, it's a basic recipe using an ingredient you might be growing in your garden that you didn't know to use and have previously thrown on the mulch pile. Waste not, want not.

The recipe sounds great, but what can be substituted for "garlic scapes", since I don't have access to such a thing? Thank you.

This is utterly delicious as is. Both of my young children gobbled it up. The pistachio really lends a nice flavor and it's much nicer than any other recipe for garlic scape pesto that I've tried.

Hmmm. I'm going to have to try this. Normally I don't cut off the scapes on my garlic. I let them go, and they make tiny garlic bulblets, which I plant instead of the cloves.

I look forward to making this every spring. It cuts short the long wait for summer basil pesto! I made this recipe with walnuts and put the entire results on a pound of pasta. You can freeze pesto for at least a year (mine never lasts longer because I eat it).
