Seems many people write reviews not knowing what they are talking about. This recipe is correct. Jews DO use smoked LOX, either nova (not salty) or belly lox (that is salty) both of which are smoked and different than cured.

i enjoyed this recipe quite a lot - nice departure from the standard matzoh brei.i might add a dash of hot pepper sauce, but otherwise it's quite good.

Just to clarify something -- there are two kinds of smoked salmon. "Warm" smoked and "cold" smoked. "Cold" smoked salmon is the kind used by Jews for things like laks and bagels, and is the kind that many Scandinavians prefer of the two. There is also gravlaks, which is cured, not smoked, salmon. It is cured with salt and dill. Gravlaks and cold smoked salmon are not the same.

One of your reviewer says that the traditional Jewish lox is cured not smoked. That is not my experience. Also this recipe is a combination of scrambled eggs, lox and onions [available in all good Jewish delis] and matza brie [scrambled eggs and matze] which is available in all Jewish homes. Lox, the smoked kind, does not respond well to heat, so I always saute my onions, then add my lox for a very brief time. Then I remove all that from the heat and scramble the matza and eggs, adding the lox and onions at the final moments so that in incorporates into the dish but does not cook more.

Traditional jewish salmon is gravlaax or "lox". It is cured, not smoked. Cooking it ruins it. Fresh salmon is a better choice for this recipe. Also, the water should be squeezed out of the matzos.

Adding some garlic and cayanne pepper really added to my attempt at this dish!
