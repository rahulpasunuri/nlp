Ease of prep. and cleanup was simple with aluminum foil over pan. I didn't have hoisin, used oyster sauce instead. Doubled garlic, added powdered ginger, used a bit of sesame oil with veg. oil. Also added some chilis for heat. Didn't have time to marinade overnight; just an hour. Still very good.

I only had 1/4 cup of hoisin left, so next time I'll go to the store to make sure I have enough. Very nice, light flavor and easy to make, but it needed the additional hoisin. Think I'll try the grill next time instead of the broiler.

Good, but not great. I didn't have sesame seeds, though I doubt it would have changed it from three to four forks.

I made this last night they were fabulous! I took another reviewer's advice and used ginger (I used that new kind in the tube, about 1 tbsp). I served with Jasmine rice - will definitely make again!

3.5 rating. I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I used 1/2 rice vinegar & 1/2 white wine vinegar. Very Good, very tasty. My fiance even ate with his fingers and he "never" eats with his hands even if they were ribs but not these. I rarely ever make the same dish twice but these I have to squeeze in again soon.

The beauty of this recipe is its simplicity-the ribs come out juicy and flavorful without any pre-cooking. These were as tasty as can be with everything just like it is. Hoisin is meant to be subtle-the garlic is its booster. Will do this again.

I've made this recipe (as written) 4 or 5 times now. It's great, it's easy, and it works everytime. The ribs are even more flavorful if you make them a day ahead and reheat. Great for parties!

We have made this recipe over and over again and folks LOVE it. Someone always asks for the recipe. First we cook the ribs in beer and water at a low simmer for about 45 minutes (don't over boil or they will be dry and tough) until very tender. Then marinate in the hoisan sauce for anywhere from 1/2 hour to overnight. We then throw them on the grill for about 10-15 minutes and baste while grilling and voila - great ribs. I just buy toasted sesame seeds and toss the seeds with the ribs after grilling. Make sure to serve with the boiled leftover marinade! We often boil the ribs the day before and then have a quick and easy week night dinner the next day.

I have made this dish many times, always to rave reviews. I have grilled, baked, or broiled the ribs, and they always come out great. I serve it with coconut rice (rice steamed with 1/2 water, 1/2 coconut milk), and with the boiled marinade over the rice it is fantastic!

These were really good, except my pork was too fatty. That is not the fault of this recipe. I may try with port chops.

Incredible recipe! Don't skimp on the hoisin sauce. Ginger pieces work well in the marinade also, just be sure to remove them before broiling. I have made this dish several times now and everyone loves it.

Baked the ribs at 250 degrees for about two hours. Grilled them for 30 minutes on medium heat. Ribs were good but not "wow". I would make them again but not a rush to share with others.

This is most tasty but I suggest that you check out the hidden fat benieth the first layer of a meaty and innocient game of the grocery stores

This is an wonderful. Easy and flavorful. I used pork back rib and it turned out great. My 9 yr old had thirds, and even wanted to eat the left overs the next day! (That never happens) Many of my party guests asked for the receipe. I will make this again, soon!

I marinated the ribs for only about 1 hour and the results were absolutely delicious. Another shortcut was using a dollop of ginger-garlic paste instead of pressed garlic. Quick, easy, finger-licking good!

This recipe is delicious! I have made it several times now!

Great recipe, follow the directions exactly. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I actually thought there was mildly too much honey, so I cut down to around 1/5 cup honey. This recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105305 has more "stuff" in it and is also very good, for those looking for a slightly different taste.

Delicious! I doubled the garlic as someone else recommended. It was great! Will definitely make again.

Yum! Yum! Excellent flavour. The kids loved it! I doubled the garlic. Also, cubed & skewered some of the meat for appys. If you want, skip the oven part at the end, and throw them on the barby. Make double the amount of sauce for sure! (: (:

Relatively simple to prepare and surprisingly short time in the oven. Makes a lovely presentation, too. I was short of hoisin sauce so my marinade had proportionately more honey - didn't suffer in the slightest.

Easy, delicious, great aroma. I didn't broil, just baked at 350 for 40 min. due to the size of the meat portions.

Overall good...Would make again..Maybe a little more honey...Some spice....

My husband and kids are not too adventurous when it comes to food, so it was great to find a new recipe that was a hit with all. Very easy to prepare, although I did not have rice vinegar so I used Rice wine and white vinegar combined. I also baked it a bit longer than suggested. This would also be good as an appetizer to take to a party.

This recipe is very easy and adaptable. We like to use the sauce for grilled salmon.

Terrific and so easy! I used boneless country-style ribs, which made it even more tasty. Perhaps because of that, they were done with the broiling, I didn't need the additional baking. I think this is a great recipe to make for company, and I bet it would be great on the grill.

Even though this recipe is really easy, I was somewhat disappointed with the taste. It seemed bland, also somewhat bitter. Results don't justify making this dish again.

The simplet recipes are very often the best. And this is definitely one of them. It's a sure fire pleaser! Try it with boneless chicken thighs, as well.

Very quick and easy to prepare. I used boneless pork chops and they came out very moist and tender. Also used sirloin tips with the same results. The marinade is probably useful for most meats.

Very tastey and easy dish. Would also be nice with a better quality of meat like pork tenderloin.

Wonderful and easy way to prepare ribs. The kids love it. Grill them if you are able.

Even though I had to go to 4 stores for Hoisin sauce (we are in Tokyo), it was worth it! We broiled it as directed then let it cook a bit longer than suggested in a foil covered pan. Bravo!

I did this recipe on the barbeque instead of in the broiler, and the results were wonderful. In addition, I had only marinated the ribs for four hours before cooking; I can only imagine how good they'll be when I have more time!
