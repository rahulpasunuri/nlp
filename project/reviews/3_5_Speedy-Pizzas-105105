Easy, versatile, and so good! I save a step by using spray oil both sides of the tortilla, put on my toppings, and slide onto my cast iron grill pan I keep in the oven - cook about 5-8 min. I'm sure it would work too on baking sheet flipped over so the tortillas slide off easily. Great results and you can use anything you've got around.

Another great alternative to using a tortilla is to use pita bread.

A hit. Fun to make, serve, and eat. We'll be making this versatile treat for years to come.

This was great -- easy, delicious and fast. What's even better is that it's versatile, so that you can use whatever ingredients you have on hand.

We do this all the time. It's great for low-carb, South Beach diet types of meals, especially when using whole what tortillas. Pitas split in half long ways and baked for about 5 minutes before putting on the toppings work about the same.

This is a great recipe because it utilizes ingredients on hand and is something satisfying that you can make quickly. It's one of those dishes you make when you can't think of anything else, or don't have much energy. I make it with tomatoes because my husband can't digest peppers--it still works very well.

excellent for a quick low-fat depending on what you top it with. I stil love Chicago style pizza, but as a quick snack or appitizer last minute it sounds great.

I made this according to the directions and found it to be easy and tasty, but realized that I would prefer using the toasting method for tostadas. I used vegetarian refried beans, monterey jack cheese, homemade salsa, avocado slices and chopped, mixed greens. Definitely not a pizza, but just as quick and delicious.

This is a great lunch or appetizer idea. I liked the way you cooked the tortilla. It was perfect and looked like the picture. We used BBQ chicken, basil, peppers, onions and Monterey Jack. I wll definitely make this again for a quick lunch. My grandchildren will love this!

Easy and Fun! This turned out much better than I had expected. We followed the recipe as shown but you could really top with just about any kind of cheese and even some grilled shrimp. This will become a great weeknight staple.

We loved this quick pizza recipe for a Saturday lunch when we were in a hurry for something great but light. We added anchovies and mushrooms and some basil leaves and all during lunch were thinking of other vaiations we could do another time. The thin crust made us think of our first pizza in Rome!

As a vegetarian, I'm really pleased that Gourmet seems to be including more meatless recipes. However, this one seems to be lacking something. I thought that the onion-pepper mixture would be more more flavorful, espcialy in that I used a top brand of peppers. This dish was tasty and unique but it cannot compare to the bobolis-style pizza I usually make.
