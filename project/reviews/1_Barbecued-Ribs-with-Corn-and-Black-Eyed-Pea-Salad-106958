We tried this as a quick weekday dinner, and it was very disappointing even though we weren't expecting a lot. Would not do this again. There are lots of other excellent & fast recipes out there.

Umm... of course it's quick - it's basically reheating takeout. I'm certain this is a nice recipe for corn and black-eyed pea salad, but it sure ain't a recipe for ribs.
