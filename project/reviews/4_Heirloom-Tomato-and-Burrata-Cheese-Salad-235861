Note to self: Scoop the burrata. Do not try to slice it ...

I threw this recipe together one evening when we had a surprise dinner guest and we were all blown away. I only had one small round of burrata which I gave to my husband who found it a little too rich; the rest of us enjoyed the salad with fresh hand-stretched mozzarella which was delicious. I served it with some simply grilled chicken breasts and the extra dressing was a perfect complement. My teenage daughter loved it so much that she has requested it every few days since its debut!

Before you go making this all complicated with reductions and herbs and fancy stuff, just try it as is... you won't regret it. That is, as long as you're using really phenomenal olive oil. I serve mine with some crostini.....

How can u go wrong with this one?? Used my own organic tomatoes and fresh oregano along with a balsamic reduction with fresh rosemary and brown sugar. Gotta love tomato season

I made this tonight for two. Used one large German Johnson tomato that didn't look all that great once I cut into it. I had to cut it smaller pieces than quarters. I did find the burrata cheese after much searching, and I would say it was worth the effort. I thought the recipe did not sound that great, so I made a balsamic reduction and added that just before serving. Wow! This was excellent. We eat a lot of heirloom tomatoes from our Farmer's Market, and this was the bomb!

Heirlooms are awesome! Perfect recipe as written, but for variety try grinding dried herbs de provence over the tomatoes and tossing in a few slices of Vidalia onion. I can serve this every day when fresh tomatoes are in season, and we never get tired of it!

This is a fantastic salad even if you can't find heirloom tomatoes. Definitely company worthy. The presentation is beautiful.

Hands Down, my favorite salad! This is awesome as is, however should you want to take it to another level and make it really special: drizzle with a good, thick, aged balsamic reduction. MMM, Divinity!

You can't go wrong with this, but the key is tomatoes from the garden or farmer's market and the cheese from a reputable cheese store. It's simple and fresh. I made this to go with the salmon with lime/butter sauce (from this site) and made the corn from that recipe as well. We were happy.
