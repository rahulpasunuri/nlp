I have made this now twice. Last time I was cooking and Needed more beef broth, I ran to the store and they were out, I went to Whole Foods and all they had was Pacific soup starter "beef pho" I never heard of if, I purchased it and added it to the soup. TRY IT!!! If you have made the soup before add the beef pho you will be pleasantly surprised..... will keep this one and make over and over!!!

This is an excellent thick soup worthy of 3 and a half forks, not quite exceptional but delicious. I increased the pearl barley to 1/2 cup, as others had suggested, and felt that the recipe could handle even more. I substituted carrots for the celery due to personal preference and used 14 ounces each of pureed and diced tomatoes. That seemed to be about right. I also followed other reviewers' recommendations and used an additional four cups of beef broth instead of water and some minced garlic instead of garlic powder. The sliced okra just about disappeared into the broth, so don't be afraid to try it. It seemed to add to the recipe, and my guests commented that they liked it. Even a semi-pro chef in attendance had favorable comments.

Really good recipe. Followed it exactly but used carrots instead of okra. I also added a dash of thyme and all beef broth per other reviews. To enhance the depth of flavor, I added the juice of half a lime and it really balanced it out. I also salted the meat and the veggies while they were cooking and added more salt and pepper to the soup.

This is a wonderful soup. It only needs a tiny bit of hot pepper sauce or it will blow your head off! My family loved this. My seven year old, who has very specific taste, said, "This is DELICIOUS!" I added 1 more cup of barley which added texture and absorbed some of the heat from the hot sauce. I did not add Okra as I don't care for it. DELISH recipe!

My family loves this recipe. Along with the barley, I use 3/4 C of a rice medley (from CostCo) which includes wild rice, lentils, brown rice, barley, etc. I substitute beef broth for the water. I add fresh carrots and omit the corn. I also throw in a can of green beans when I add the frozen peas at the end.

Great standby soup. I used only 1 14-oz can of tomatoes & it was great. Also added 1/2 more barley in last 45 minutes.

I have used this recipe for a very long time...choose a very good beef broth/base and lay a sprig of fresh rosemary on the top of your soup about 30 mins. before serving and cover it.....when you lift the lid to serve ......it smells soooooo good !

This is delicious stew. I made it true to the recipe (except no meat bones) at first, but then when the soup was finished, I cooked up more barley to add to it. Love the okra in it.

This is a nice hearty soup. LOVE the okra! I add a pinch of red pepper flakes vs. hot sauce and fresh garlic vs. powder. I ended up adding more water/broth as it is yummy soupier (if that's a word :0)

So good! I eliminated the bones, corn, okra, peas and hot pepper sauce (some because I didn't have it and some because I forgot). I also subbed tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes as recommended by other reviewers. Also, I added about a cup of red wine. I make a lot of soup and my husband raved about this! We'll definitely be making this again and again.

I have been making this soup for a couple years. I have made some adjustments thru the years. I use 4 cans of beef stock, 2 cups of water,1 can of tomato sauce instead of the the tomatoes,1 package of mixed vegetables replaces the okra and corn. To add a little intensity and richness to the flavor stir in 2 TBL of curry powder. Enjoy

I used 1 pound of beef stew meat and one pound of beef shank "for soup." I did not use okra since I have never had it made well and I live in Indiana, where it is almost never available fresh. Still keeping an open mind, though. Didn't use barley despite having some on hand. Used potatoes and corn off the cob, which is probably the last for the season. I used one large fresh garlic clove (honestly, who uses powdered anymore?) and haricot verts in place of the okra. Yukon golds replaced the barley, which turned out really well. I used twice as many potatoes as other reviewers who made the switch (4 versus 1 or 2) and thought it turned out well. No celery, but used thinly sliced cabbage when I added the fresh corn. The starch from the corn added a nice silkiness and the cabbage added pungency. I threw in a tablespoon of balsamic at the end, which punched up the flavors. I agree with previous reviewers that this needs double the time suggested to make the beef tender. I started preparing the soup at 3:00 PM on a Sunday and I wish I had started it at noon. Good biolerplate.

Rating: 3
This is reasonably easy and a good recipe. I omitted the okra-don't like it- and subbed in 6C of beef broth instead of the combination water/beef. I only used 1tsp of hot sauce which was plenty and 1C barley. I also cut the beef into much smaller pieces than stew meat and will go even smaller next time, definitely needs bite size for a soup. Otherwise a nice and easy soup, which I would give 3.5 forks if possible.

This is a wonderful start to a great beef soup but I wanted a lot more spice and depth. I made these changes; used tomatoes with jalepenos, lots of fresh garlic, heavy pinch of montreal steak seasoning, and cup of good red wine. It turned out GREAT!

Very tasty recipe. I was not very true to it, however. I put everything in a slow cooker in the morning, and it made a tasty dinner that night. I increased the barley to 1/2 cup and will actually increase it a full cup next time I make it. Also, I just used whatever vegetables I had on hand, including a baking potato that I cut into very small pieces. More barley and the potato made it heartier.

I just made this for the first time and my husband and I really liked it. I made a double batch (it made TONS for the freezer) and made a couple of minor changes. I also omitted the okra simply because I did not feel like it, and added carrots and red potatoes. I also added an addition 1/4 cup of barley, a small dash on dried thyme, and omitted the hot pepper sauce. But I feel like a stayed pretty true to the recipe. I also maintained the water/beef broth ration. I agree with another reviewer that this was a little heartier than I was expected- I wonder, if people want more of a veggie soup, if you could make it with the beef bones and leave out the stew meat. You would still get a little meat after you cool and shred the meat from the bones. My only complaint about this recipe is that I think it needs to cook much longer, maybe double the time, at an aggressive simmer, to get a flavorful broth and to tenderize the meat.

This has become an instant classic for our family. My wife, who never eats leftovers, continued to dine on this wonderful dish until it was gone two days later. I made a bunch of modifications to this recipe to customize this dish to the tastes of my family. I dropped the okra, corn and peas. In place of the garlic powder and pepper sauce, I minced three fresh cloves of garlic and one jalapeno pepper and sautéed them with the onions and garlic. I also added two sliced carrots to replace the other vegetables. Like several of the other reviewers, I used six cups of beef broth instead of the broth / water mix. Finally, I increased the cooking time to three hours which helped give the broth a richer flavor. I served the soup with Caramelized-Shallot Mashed Potatoes which also can by found on Epicurious.

This was very good! I added diced tomatoes with green chiles, and it gave it a wonderful spice. I would suggest adding the okra closer to the end so it doesn't get so soggy.

This is really a good recipe. I mitted the Okra, because I don't like it, and I substitued green beans for peas, because that's what I had on hand. I also added 2 cubes of beef bullion, because I did not have any beef bones on hand. The recipe is excellent, hearty and easy. I also increased the amount of barley to 1/2 cub, just to finish the bag, and the quantity is fine in relation to the rest of the ingredients I would actually rename this recipe to "Vegetable Barley and Beef Soup", because that more accurately reflects the proportion of the ingredients. Delicious soup nonetheless, and definitely worth making and enjoying!

I though this soup was good, but not great. I felt it lacked zip. I doubled the recipe, but forgot to add an additional 28 oz. can of chopped tomatoes, although I did add double the beef stock and everything else. I also did not use the beef bones but added 3 lbs. of stew beef instead of just 2 lbs. I added some dried thyme, mushrooms, 4 cloves of fresh garlic. I did not add the okra, substituting 3 Yukon Golds. Good for a cold day, but reminded me more of beef stew than anything else. I guess I was looking for a lighter, thinner, zestier soup. THis is thick, hearty and stew-like.

A great soup. I omitted the okra too becuase the frozen kind is just too slimey for me. BUT having recently tried cooking with fresk okra, I would like to try using fresh next time.

One of the best soup recipes I've tried in a long time. Took other reviewers' advice, omitted the okra (not because I can't get it; I just don't like it), added diced potatoes, celery & carrots, and doubled the amount of barley. Also took the advice to replace the garlic powder with minced garlic and added fresh rosemary. Yum! A great and easy cold-weather meal.

Hearty, simple, delicious. Don't mess with this one too much and it will be a hit. I did leave out the okra because it is hard to find in central Wisconsin and it really has no place in the food chain (no hate letters please) and I just dumped a half a bag of mixed veggies in, not separating the poor, delicate peas and everything worked out just fine. I gave it four forks because I thought it was outstanding in its class, maybe not "beyond compare" but definitely top-of-the-heap.

Liked this very much but made a few changes. I sauteed fresh garlic, onion and 1/3 cup of barley. With 30 minutes left, I added one small diced Yukon gold potato, 1/2 cup fresh carrots and 3/4 cup of sliced mushrooms, then with 20 minutes left, I added 5oz of both corn and okra. I also added another 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and S+P to taste. Thought it came out quite well; not too hearty or thick but not too "soupy". Excellent winter main course with a loaf of good bread.

surprisingly good since I don't like okra.

Absolutely phenomenal! A couple of minor changes: Substituted three cloves of garlic for the garlic powder. Added at the end of the onion/celery saute. Omitted the okra and peas and added three carrots a half pound of green beans and a large potato. Wait until the last 20 minutes or so before adding the corn and beans. Like another reviewer, added a couple of sprigs of rosemary - a nice touch. Really, really fantastic and makes the house smell awesome!

My wife thought it was great but I felt it was a little bland. After reading all the reviews I did make some changes. I Saute' the shank bones first and removed, then the stew meat with and an extra half pound in small batches so they browned well. With no meat in the pot, I saute' the vegatables and double the barley adding 2 chopped carrots all of which nicely deglazed the pot and returned the meat and bones. Next time I would substitute broth for the water and add a bottle of beer which should take care of the blandness and add a little more volume as this was close to being a stew. In place of the corn, peas and okra I substituted a large Russet potato diced to a half inch, 3 carrots sliced and two cups of green beans. As for the hot pepper sauce start with 1 tsp. and add to taste.

My family loved it. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today. I sauteed fresh, minced garlic with the onions instead of adding garlic powder. As a lot of the reviewers recommended, I used about 2/3 cup barley and substituted potatoes for the okra. I left out the peas. I didn't wait to add the corn and had no problems with it getting mushy. I would add 1 tsp of hot sauce and taste it before adding anymore because I used 2 tsp and some in my family thought it had too much of a kick. Perfect for a cold winter night.

Best winter soup ever! I like the okra for the texture it gives, and you otherwise don't even know it's there, I add more peas, corn and beef broth and a half pound more beef and 2/3 cup barley & it is perfect. Family LOVES it - Thanks!

This is a great soup for cold winter nights. Since my wife is not a huge fan of okra I substituted potato's which gave the soup a nice "hearty" texture. As another reviewer noted, wait until the last 15-20 minutes of cooking to add the peas and corn in order to avoid overcooking them.

I give two forks as I made the recipe as published. With minor changes it rates 3-1/2. Suggest do not add okra, corn and peas until last 20 minutes of cooking - that's all they need. I left 1/2 of okra whole as didn't want gumbo-like texture - I used fresh. For cooks who suggested okra was for southern tastes -according to Epicurious dictionary, okra was introduced to America by Ethiopian slaves. This is a commonly used veg in Mediterranean and middle east cooking.

Made this for the 1st time yesterday and it was delicious. Used all beef shank meat and bones for a tender chew and hearty, marrowed-flavor. Used 1 less cup of water and 1/2 cup of barley. Instead of separate packages of corn and peas, used 1- 10oz box of frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, carrots and beans) for extra color and texture. No okra, but used dried roasted garlic. Very easy and and child friendly too, my 1 year old loved it.

My husband thought this soup was one of the best I have ever made - I thought it was just okay. Of course, I improvised like most of my fellow cooks/chefs - I used a pound & a half of the meat, used 1/4 cup barley but agree with other cooks to increase to 1/2 cup, didn't quite seem to be enough. Also, instead of 4 cups water I think I would use beef broth next time to give it more flavor although I did use the bones but they didn't seem to quite do the job. I used fresh corn kernels b/c they were in the fridge & needed to be used up. I omitted the okra like most - where is that one person that likes this stuff??? I also omitted frozen peas b/c I didn't have any - definitely added tabasco to my bowl which seemed to give this soup that it needed for my taste.

This recipe was an excellent end to another snowy day! I improvised a bit, based on the other ratings. I deleted the okra (I too am a Nothern girl).

As a matter of fact, my neighbor is ditching her recipe and adopting this one. Kudos!!

This recipe is a perfect base. Twist it to your family's taste. We use Minor's Beef Base (paste) instead of broth, use fresh corn off the cob and green beans instead of okra, I guess only because we're northern. Anyway, usually leave out the FROZEN peas... this soup is really great if you grow fresh rosemary and can put two or three sprigs in the pot an hour or so before you eat....that's the secret.

I hate to be the lone dissenter, but this soup/stew recipe was simply not a good showcase for beef, and it greatly lacked flavor. I followed other reviewers advice and substituted a potato for the okra after simmering until my london broil was tender. Perhaps red wine, some fresh thyme or Herbes de Provence would have picked the flavor up more--at any rate, the recipe as is was third-rate. Bon Appetit published a beef stew with rutabaga recipe in February 1997 that I would recommend as a "three/four" forker instead.

Rating: 3
This was great. I changed things up a little, but the basic recipe works. I added brown sugar, port wine (while braising the beef to deglaze the pan), and again to add some body to the broth, cinnamon, and clove to take some of the acid out of the tomatoes and make the soup more festive for Christmas. Also did potato and carrot instead of okra. Finished with mushrooms late in the simmer, and some fresh cilantro added table side. Hope I can make it the same way next time...

This is an absolutely first-rate recipe, and so delicious! I substituted a half-package of frozen baby limas for the okra and sauted a large clove of chopped, fresh garlic with the onion, in place of the garlic powder. I omitted the hot sauce, since I'm not fond of that taste, although I did try a bowl with a dash of it, just to make sure I wasn't missing out on something terrific. I wasn't.

When I first tasted the soup I was disappoointed that it tasted greasy. Ideally, I think I'd make time to refrigerate it after the first hour of cooking to get the fat off. Then put it back on to cook for the final 30 minutes. Also, don't add the corn and peas until the final 15 minutes or you will have grey peas and soggy corn. The hot sauce is very necessary, but be careful as the amount can vary depending on the type you use and your personal taste. I would add cubed potatos at the 30 minute mark. Also, I left out the okra as I HATE the stuff. I will make it again
