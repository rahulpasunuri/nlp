These were just OK - I liked the texture, but they had a rather generic "cookie" flavor. I think I'll stick to pure peanut butter or oatmeal - this recipe does no favor to either type. The pecan addition just diluted the peanut butter flavor - it didn't come through in the final cookies.

Not enough peanut butter flavor - very bland overall. Nice texture, though. Baked in about 8 minutes even when I turned the oven down. Hoping they'll improve with freeaing.

These cookies are delicious and have a nice crispy texture with a slightly chewy center. I used fresh ground peanut butter and organic pecans for the nut butter. I was not overwhelmed with the nutty flavor and I think I might reduce the sugar just a bit when I make them again. I used level tablespoons for portioning and placed the rounded side up on the cookie sheet when baking and they looked store bought. Interestingly, the cookies in the top portion of the oven had a nice cracked surface on them, whereas those in the bottom third stayed smooth. Maybe better to rotate and change the sheet positions halfway through. Lastly, portioning 1 level tablespoon of dough made about 42 cookies for me.

I also added chocolate chips and they were super delicious!

Excellent . .. tried it exactly as the recipe stated and I'm quite happy to eat the batch all by myself.

The best peanut butter cookies ever! Be sure to use kosher salt it gives a great sweet & salty combo. I have added dark chocolate chips at times. They are good but I still think the recipe is best as is. The cookies hold their shape so I will experiment this weekend with hearts for my sons valentines day party.

A very nice rif on peanut butter cookies. I did deviate by using chunky peanut butter and only old-fashioned oats. It would be interesting to see the texture difference, but not worth buying two ingredients that I never use. The resultant texture was a great cripsy cookie (my personal favorite) with little pieces of peanut still present.

Lovely taste and texture. The pecans add more depth and complexity to the flavor. My one gripe is there is just a tad too much baking soda--enough to actually taste it in the cookie when it's cooked. I would use 2/3 tsp instead of 1 whole tsp.

Ohh-la-la! These are GREAT cookies. Melt in your mouth texture, wonderful complex flavor. Using both kinds of oats is key for texture - so worth it! And the pureed pecan yumminess sings in every bite. Taste gets an A, texture an A+, ease of preparation a B- (you must chill the dough for at least 3 hours), expensiveness a B+ (pecans and two kinds of oats add up), presentation a B (they don't look fancy), so overall the recipe is a B+.

Excellent moist peanut butter cookie. I made a batch and between my husband and 2 sons they were gone in 2 hours. Will include these in my holiday cookie tray for sure.

Quite possibly the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever - not at all dry. The pecans are a must! I only had old fashioned oats so I used them. Also I divided the dough and made some with 60% cocoa chips - came out just as great!

These are great - an upscale peanut butter cookie. Don't omit the pecans; they are what give them the unique flavor.
