Best cornbread recipe I've made so far. Only difference is I put a little less than 1/3 cup sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet and it was perfect (for my taste.) Moist and delicious...definitely a keeper!

One word for it, awful!!

I made this for the Southwest Corn & Green Chilies stuffing recipe and thought it was just fine. I nibbled a little to see if would be dry, as per other reviewers, but it was moist and surprisingly tasty for an unembellished, basic cornbread. I suspect the cornmeal makes a difference--mine was fresh from the store and probably not as dry as if it had been sitting in the pantry for six months.

This produced a moist and buttery corn bread. I made it to go in the stuffing, so I had to leave it out for a day. The kids could not keep their hands off it while it sat out. It is really delicious.

This recipe is tasty but it is a bit too dry due to too much cornmeal. The second time I made this recipe, I only put in 1 cup of cornmeal instead of 2. If you look at other recipes most are even amounts of flour to cornmeal or even slightly more flour ie 1 cup flour and 3/4 cup of cornmeal. If you are not making this for stuffing, I would also suggest that you add 1 can (450 g) of creamed corn and a small can of green chillies. With these additions and the modfication in the quantity of the cornmeal, I would rate this 4 forks.

Try evening out the sweetness with green chiles and sharp cheddar. When you put the batter into the pan, add half and then sprinkle that with grated cheddar and sauteed green chiles and garlic. Then smooth the remainder of the batter on top and top with more cheddar.

This cornbread had a nice flavor but it really was very dry. The recipe in "The Bread Bible" is much better.

I was looking forward to a good buttermilk corn bread because the only other recipe I love for cornbread is a sharp cheddar cheese cornbread.. however I found this cornbread really dry and not moist like it should be. I cut it in half and it rose pretty good though.

Wonderful!

It worked well to cut the recipe in half to fit an 8 x 8 pan. Nice corn flavor but a little dry. Next time I'll cook it for less time. It didn't rise as much as I expected.

I thought this recipe was good, but it wasn't as moist as I expected. Maybe this was because I didn't have buttermilk, and had to use regular milk instead. Still...I would make it again, it's very good.

I thought this recipe was delicious. Moist and flavorful. Much better than any other corn bread recipe I've tried. I did however cut the sugar by half.

Look no further! Perfectly sweet cornbread that begs for honey butter. P.S. If you don't like sweet cornbread and prefer to put the emphasis on 'corn', continue on.

This is a lovely recipe. Easy too. It's great on its own but I'm going to use it in a stuffing for my turkey.

If you like a moist, cakey, and sweet cornbread, this is the recipe for you. Very quick and easy, but in the future I'd cut the sugar in half and add some frozen corn kernels.

This cornbread recipe was very tasty. I ate some and then saved the rest for my cornbread stuffing with sweet italian sausage, raisins, dried cherries, apples, fresh herbs, onions, and red bell pepper.
