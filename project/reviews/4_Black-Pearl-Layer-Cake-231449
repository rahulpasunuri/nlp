This is a great cake! Interesting flavors and textures all add up to a great finish to Xmas Eve. I found this cake easy to make and assemble - it does take time, so plan accordingly. I had a few issues-all of which are my own fault. My first issue is that I used wasabi paste, didn't check the strength and merely doubled it per other reviews. The wasabi could be tasted in the ganache. It wasn't bad - actually quite good. My thought on the wasabi though, is that it shouldn't be tasted, it should enhance the ganache and add to the complexity of the whole. Next time, I will make as written, take my tasting notes and proceed from there. Second issue is the ganache itself. After covering the chocolate mixture and letting it sit for 15 min., it was hard to mix in the butter - I believe I let it cool too much. Also, the next morning upon assembling the cake, the ganache was too hard to spread - I had to warm it up a bit - I stuck the metal bowl in a warm oven for ~2 min. and that seemed to work. Next time, I'll watch the boil to make sure it doesn't boil too much (hardness?) and make sure the butter is incorporated when the mixture is still warm. All in all, what I love about this recipe is how easy it is to adjust to individual taste - more/less/no wasabi or replace with cayenne for a different taste; less ginger or more; more sesame seeds or none at all. Raves were heard round the table for this one and that's what I like! As a postscript, the ginger syrup is great to make for cocktails. I ended up making a separate batch and mixing it with bourbon and lime - nice way to end MY evening - cocktail in hand and feet up!

It got rave reviews from everyone who tried it at our party last night. Such complex flavors and textures that meld together into a delicious cake. We used some of the left over ginger syrup in the whipped cream rather than powdered sugar and vanilla. Turned out beautifully.

This turned out very well for me. I used 2 tall 9-inch cake pans, since I didn't have 8- in pans, and just cooked the cake layers a couple of extra minutes. If I made this cake again, I'd make three cups of the whipped cream frosting, rather than two. For those who found the cake dense and fudgy, I think, given the amount of leavening agents used, that this recipe is meant to be made with natural cocoa, and not dutch-processed (processed with alkali) cocoa. I'm guessing that using the latter would keep the cake from rising as much.

Rave reviews for this cake and I will definitely be making it again. I found the whip cream icing lacked body and was a little bland, so i will take another reviewer's suggestion to double the ginger. The flavours of the cake and the ganache, however, were to die for. It was actually even better the next day (and I had frozen the cake to make reveal day a little less hectic. Didn't hurt it at all!). A favourite for certain.

This cake is phenomenal! It's not over-the-top odd and it's just unique enough to make it stand out. This recipe wasn't difficult to make at all. I've made this cake over three dozen times, all with excellent results. Here are some tips to make it easier: Save yourself the $9.00 and don't bother buying a vanilla bean. You don't need it. Honestly, just double the amount of vanilla extract you put into the whipped cream frosting. Also, Nothing needs to stand overnight. I've made this cake from start to finish in one hour and the results are consistently incredible. Put the layers in the freezer for about 15 minutes to cool. The ganache doesn't need to sit overnight. The syrup doesn't need to sit for an hour either. The flavors will meld nicely as you are simmering it. Wasabi powder is fine to use, but you will never be able to taste it. Go for the paste instead and feel free to double or even triple the amount. The same for the ginger. I double the amount for the whipped cream frosting and yet it is still only subtly flavored with ginger. Lastly, although this cake recipe is fine (it's just a standard chocolate cake), Dunkin Hine's Dark Chocolate Cake mix is ten times better and cuts alot of time out of prep. Go for it! You won't be dissapointed with the results!

I have never reviewed a recipe on epicurious before but felt this cake deserved it. Wonderful. Well worth the effort - made the cake and ginger syrup ahead and froze the cake until needed. Made the ganache one day ahead and assembled the cake an hour before eating. Tripled the wasabi (and used paste not powder) and added an extra 2 tbsp chopped ginger. The flavours melded beautifully without being overpowering. A sophisticated take on chocolate cake.

I had such high hopes for this cake because of the interesting flavour combinations. Unfortuantely the cake was very bland. Maybe instead of using all boiling water, half of it should have called for hot coffee. The ginger syrup helped keep the cake moist but it was bothersome to wait for all the layers to soak up the liquid, and I became concerned when the layers themselves started to look too wet. For the cake layers themselves,the chopped ginger should have been grated in for better flavour distribution. The ganache had a good texture from the crunchy black sesame seeds. However, you could not detect the ginger or the wasabi (and this was after I had already increased the wasabi amount based previous reviews). The whipped cream frosting came together in a cinch, but again, no ginger flavour came through.

Rating: 0
This was a wonderful cake! I didn't want too exotic of a cake, so I left the wasabi powder and sesame seeds out of the ganache, and it was still a delicious and subtly different dessert. The whipped cream frosting was a great contrast to the intensity of the ganache and cake.

I think this is a really good recipe, but I don't think it's for everyone's tastebuds. I liked it, but even I have to say I can see what some of the other users mentioned as a "dirt" taste. Again, not for everyone, but a fun cake to make. I especially like the sesame seeds and chocolate combo.

I am a HUGE fan of Vosges chocolate, and my favorite bar is the Black Pearl. I was trying to locate my perfect birthday cake when I found this recipe and stopped all searches. The cake is wonderful. It has the interesting and unusual ingredients not found in other cakes, but it is not so "out there" that your guests will think you're crazy. The cake itself is quite easy to make. The ganache and simple syrup couldn't be more simple. However, since there are four components to this cake, plan your strategy. I made the cake one day. Froze it. Made the syrup and ganache another day. When I was ready to bring everything together, I just allowed the ganache to get to room temperature and it took no time at all. I will definitely make this cake again - it was a big hit.

This was a good cake. Dense in flavor. This was pretty heavy duty for a non-baker like me and prep was rought, but the end result was beautiful and tasty.

This is a spectacular chocolate cake. While the unusual ingredients might put people off if they know about them first, I've found that those who try the cake without knowing what's in it just can't stop talking about it. The chocolate cake itself is dense and fudgy with a well-rounded chocolate flavor. The ganache is rich without being overpowering and the little crunchy sesame seeds in the ganache and on the whipped cream frosting add wonderful little pops of sesame flavor with each bite. The wasabi isn't distinguishable in the ganache, but definitely adds a little extra something that people just can't place their fingers on. I've made this cake many times (including in several wedding cakes) and it's become my favorite cake recipe.

The only thing I didn't do was put the sesame seeds on the top. Since I had older guests at my Christmas party I thought they might think it was weird. Most everything else I did as written, except I also doubled the wasabi. I forgot to pour the ginger syrup on before putting on the ganache so I flipped the layers over and poured it that way, but did not use all of the syrup (which, by the way, I could drink straight - yum!). My layers were frozen when I put on the ganache and it firmed up quickly so it was easy to hold as I poured on the syrup. Also, I made the whipped cream right before serving so as a "complete" cake it was only together for an hour before serving. It really was fabulous and got lots of raves. It seems like a lot of work or steps but each is really pretty easy. Don't let this recipe intimidate you as it did me. Make it. It's worth it!!

I made this for New Years this year with a couple of changes. I have friends who are not able to eat wheat/gluten so I substituted Spelt Flour for the APF, and in place of the cocoa powder I used a hot chocolate mix. I went with double the Wasabi as other have suggested, but I think next time I will try 3X to try and bring the heat out more.

Rating: 4
Amazing! I will be making truffles with the wasabi ginger ganache, and this is my new chocolate cake recipe otherwise. definately double the wasabi, it is not overpowering in the least, quite subtle actually (I doubled it, will triple next time) I managed to make the whole cake this afternoon, I refrigerated the ganache to speed the set time to two hours, and I put the cake layers in the freezer to cool them faster (about 30 minutes) Since I was running late I only refridgerated the finished cake for about 45 minutes--it was perfect! I was able to complete the whole thing in about 4 hours (including liquor store run and making dinner-wild mushroom cream sauce over pasta)

One of the best chocolate cakes I have ever made! Doubled the wasabi and would probably add more next time. You can taste as you go. I used a swiss buttercream frosting and did not refrigerate. This kept the ganache texture perfect. No one guessed the ingredients but raved about the end result.

YUM YUM YUM... a friend made this one night to compliment an Asian inspired dinner I was serving. When she told me what it was, although an adventurous eater, I was a bit skeptical at first. WOW was I delighted right from the initial bite. The combination of flavors is phenomenal and everyone that ate a piece agreed it was amazing. Despite the involved process, I am looking forward to making this for our Japanese themed Mother's Day lunch.

I've made this cake several times and, although quite time consuming as given, it's still a favorite of guests and myself. To make it more manageable, I omit the whipped cream frosting and double the ganache. It's also a good, plain ol' chocolate cake as well as one that is easily halved. I LOVE THIS CAKE!

This is a one-of-a-kind cake for sure. My husband loved it for his birthday, but I thought it was a bit too gingery. Followed other reviewers advice on amount of wasabi used. Overall, an awesome cake, but I'd have to be in the perfect mood to have it again.

I used the basic recipe, but changed the flavors - substituted the ginger, wasabi and black sesame for vanilla, cayenne pepper and cinnamon for a Mexican chocolate theme. The cake, ganache and whipped cream icing are really easy to make - I think this was the tallest cake I've ever done, but it really held together well. The syrup feels like too much when you're brushing it on, but it's really not. I topped it all with Abuelita Mexican chocolate shavings. A big hit for a Mexican-themed summer party.

I was a bit skeptical when I first read the ingredients of this recipe, especially as I have never been a fan of wasabi. Follow other reviewers recommendations of doubling the quantity of wasabi in this recipe, you will not notice. This cake is AMAZING. A lot of work, but the perfect sophisticated chocolate cake that is not cloyingly sweet. The mixture of ingredients actually gives it a slight minty taste. Refreshing!

This cake was so good - great ginger flavor but still rich chocolatey goodness. I doubled the wasabi in the ganache, but still didn't tell my guests it was in there. It mostly serves to back up the ginger. Everyone loved it - the perfect cake to serve to a mixed group of foodies and people who prefer simple food.

I love this cake! I've made many desserts from this site, and this one has to be one of the best desserts I've ever made. The only change I made in the recipe was to double the amount of wasabi powder, as have several of the other reviewers. The cakes have the consistency of a tort- they are dense and flavorful without being dry. The filing is very complex and very delicious- the wasabi comes only at the very end, and if you weren't looking for it, you might miss it. Since my filling set up at room temperature, I think I will use it as a filling for "Black Pearl Truffles" at some point (perhaps rolled in black sesame seeds?). The frosting is light and flavorful, and perfectly balances the heaviness of the cakes. This was a big hit with my family- a very sophisticated version of a plain chocolate cake. Definitely a keeper. Do not be afriad of the wasabi, it's just delicious!

Made this cake for New Year's Eve dinner--I knew it would be time consuming, which is fine, but I just didn't think it was worth it. The cake itself was good, moist, etc. but to me the wasabi (which I doubled on the advice of reviews) made the ganache taste a bit like dirt. And the ginger didn't really stand out either. I'm a big fan of the chili/chocolate combination but was pretty unimpressed with the result here. Wasabi didn't add either heat or good flavor.

Rating: 1
I tried this because of the high rating and many enthusiastic reviews. Followed the recipe exactly and I disliked it mostly because the ginger flavor was too strong for me. I enjoy many different kinds of foods but when it comes to dessert I suppose I am too much of a traditionalist to enjoy something like this.

Rating: 4
Ah! I have been bragging that this is one of the few recipes that has a 100% here. No longer. (How could it be dry with all that ginger-vanilla syrup saturating each layer?) I just made it after 2 years of waiting for the right moment (and the kitchen remodel) - and it was an adventure in baking, right down to the search for 8" cake pans. I ended up with squares. It did not disappoint. I will admit I was already a fan of the Black Pearl chocolate from Voges. I have been taking slices of this cake around town to share with everyone I see. So far it's received rave reviews. I thought the wasabi was still weak although I did add twice the amount. Perhaps the type of the wasabi combination is the issue. Penzeys sells a couple varieties, with a wide range of heat and drama. I guess I would increase the amount before I increased the type. But it's so good I'm tempted to leave it alone.

I have been dying to make this cake for ages so made it for July 4th party. I followed the directions, other than making a double layer cake in 9in pans, but I was disappointed. Nobody raved over this cake or asked for the recipe. I thought it was somewhat dry, and although it was out of the fridge for a good 30 minutes before serving, the ganache stayed very firm. Apart from the wasabi novelty factor, there are better chocolate cake recipes than this.

I used the ganace for a different plain chocolate cake but wasn't really impressed. I knew there would be a problem when I added the corn syrup since the chocolate seized. I decided to turn it into a mousse instead hoping I could save the expensive chocolate I used. The flavor was rich and different but not as I hoped. I'll stick to my basic ganace recipe.

This is a great cake and it looked exactly like the picture..a first for me. I agree with adding more wasabi, I doubled it and still it dissapeared against the ginger. Still the cake was worth the effort..

One of the best chocolate cakes I have ever made. Moist, firm texture. Ganache was wonderful. Not too sweet. Flavors were very subtle. No one could tell there was wasabi in the mix but I think it added a special dimension to the overall effect. This cake served 14 people easily. Highly recommend trying this one. Finally, pretty easy to put together once you've got the ingredients. Have fun.

A little tip; Les Vosges chocloate in the wasabi/ginger/balack sesame flavor is carried in several stores no. My local Whole Foods has it. For those of you feeling time-pressed, you can just go and get these bars and melt them. I agree that a buttercream is way too rich, the whipped cream is jsut the right touch. It is a fantastic cake.

Rating: 4
I made this cake for the first time, and it was wonderful. I follwed the recipe almost exactly (instead using tube wasabi instead of powdered). I also used the amount of ginger the recipe called for, which was JUST right. It added a touch of ginger, but didn't overpower the chocolate flavor. I also used a whipped cream frosting, which I felt was better then buttercream because the cake is quite chocoately. Having a buttercream frosting would make this cake a bit too rich in my opinion. The only thing I would change is that I would let the cake sit at room temperature a bit longer then 30 minutes prior to serving. The ganache layer was still a bit too hard after 30 minutes,and I would have preferred it as a gooey chocolate layer instead.

I have made this cake and a couple of variations of it many times. It is one of my all-time favorite cakes.

Divinity is encapsulated in this cake. This was the first cake I ever made from scratch and made me feel like I could do anything after this! I also added extra wasabi and used fresh (from a tube) instead of powdered. I also added more ginger to the icing. I have made this cake for friends and for parties and all who tremble in fear of the wasabi end up loving it! It's amazing what the chocolate reveals in the wasabi, leaving grace notes of mint and almost floral qualities to the ganache.

I made this for a friend's birthday and it was loved by everyone. As soon as I told them what type of cake it was everyone got very exited but scared. I made the ganache the day before (doubled the wasabi as everyone as suggested) and left it out on the counter overnight. This made it very easy to spread. I also grated the fresh ginger for the syrup with a microplane grater instead of chopping it. This probably made the flavor a little more intense and I think the grated ginger blended well in the cake batter. The cake was very moist and rich so I decided to do a italian buttercream instead of the whipped cream. YUMMY!

Rating: 4
Thank you to all reviewers for the great tips. I doubled the wasabi, I think it could use even a little more. I added 2 more tablespoons of ginger, I could have added 3 or 4 more (Loved the ginger syrup!). I think I will try a good buttercream with ginger next time. The whipped cream was really good but maybe a little too light for the cake. I frosted with pink chenille swirls and sprinkled with black sesame seeds around the top.

Rating: 3
I made a ginger buttercream for this cake instead of the whipped cream, which didn't sound right, as other bakers have mentioned. I didn't have powdered wasabi so used prepared, and definitely felt it in the ganache. The cake turned out perfectly even though I didn't set the ganache overnight. Overall, this cake was delicious and decadent and the birthday girl loved it. We had it for breakfast for days afterward, yet it's so intense and rich, there was still half a cake left when I flew back home. But what I loved the most were the parts of the ginger-chocolate cake that I trimmed from the 3 layers' tops, dipped in the ginger syrup. So I have to say no, I will not put together this full cake recipe again. I would just bake the cake in a bundt pan and call it Done. The cake was moist and dense yet with plenty of rise, and the chocolate-ginger flavor combination was a knockout on its own. Maybe I'd add the ginger syrup and some whipped cream to dress it up, but I'd be happy to serve just the cake. NOTE: if you do a buttercream or other frosting, make sure you first refrigerate the assembled cake first so that the ganache is quite firm. This isn't necessary if you apply the recipe's light whipped cream topping.

I made this recipe for a mostly family picnic of unadventurous eaters so I did not tell them what was in the cake. Everyone loved it. I did not find it at all difficult and only slightly time consuming. The picnic was postponed to a week later after I had already made the ginger syrup and the ganache but it kept beautifully refrigerated. A week later I made the cake itself and only had to warm the ganache in the microwave to soften and gave it a good whipping with a whisk and it remained the perfect consistency while on the cake. Whipped cream was the perfect light foil for the richness of the cake. Although I did add extra wasabi per the suggestions I feel it was not important to actually be able to discern the wasabi- I think it's there for enhancement and not actual wasabi flavor. Also could not rationalize buying a container of three vanilla beans for $13.00 so I just added a touch of pure vanilla extract to the syrup which worked out fine.

Wonderful. I doubled the recipe (doubly doubling the wasabi), cut back a little on the chocolate in the ganache, and added extra black sesame seeds. Cake itself was just how I like it. Definitely keep in the little bits of ginger! I served the cake with ginger ice cream (well, vanilla ice cream that I softened, mixed with powdered ginger, and refroze), which complemented it perfectly.

This was a terrific cake - a good deal of work, but well worth it. I was cooking for 64, so I quadrupled the recipe and made 6 2-layer cakes (rather than 4 3-layers.) I used white sesame seeds in the ganache since I couldn't find black (which worked fine taste-wise) and tripled the wasabi, which I think was just right. I wish I'd cut back the chocolate in the ganache, as others have recommended - the de-topped cakes were fragile enough that I kept tearing off little bits at the edges when I tried to spread it. I did, however, follow others' advice on frosting and substituted buttercream for the whipped cream (I used the coconut buttercream recipe on this website, replacing the coconut with powdered ginger) which was a good call. my only caution is that the recipe makes a lot of frosting; you'll probably have some left over even if you halve it. so, a lot of steps, but in the end I had a gorgeous cake (I shaved chocolate onto the top) that wowed everybody. I would highly recommend making this cake for anyone whom you either really like or really want to impress.

I turned this into a cupcakes for a party: I baked the cupcakes for 15 minutes, cooled, then dunked them in the ginger syrup a couple times. I made the ganache ~2 hours before serving and folded a cup of whipped cream into it to turn it into a frosting. I also used a tablespoon of wasabi (and added another teaspoon to the cake batter), and could barely taste it - don't be shy with the wasabi. The cupcakes were delicious and unusual.

Rating: 3
Couldn't taste the sugared ginger in the cake, so will increase next time, but I did add ginger powder which helped to give it that flavor. Doubled the wasabi, but like a previous reader suggested, add to taste. Gave the cake a "refreshing" taste and palate-cleansing feel. The whipped topping was light and nice with the cake, though a buttercream would work just as well. I had not problems with the ganache -- made it according to directions and did not harden up as it did for others. Nice cake but not necessarily spectacular.

Absolutely the best cake I have ever baked! I followed suggestions of earlier posters and used more than double the wasabi, also increased the fresh ginger as I love ginger. Only made 2 layers from 9-in. pans. Sprinkled top with black sesame and shaved semi-sweet chocolate. Used only 5 oz of chocolate as suggested by a reviewer and the ganache was spreadable. Am obliged to make this again soon as my family complained I didn't bake enough cake. The recipe instructions may sound daunting - but don't be fazed...this was a real challenge for me as I don't really bake. But it turned out perfectly!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe that requires very little tweeking, but I offer two bits of advice. Firstly, I recommend chopping up the ginger to the desired size to make the syrup rather than doing it after the syrup is made. Secondly, the debate about the amount of wasabi can be cleared up by simply tasting the ganache as you go along. I ended up using 2 teaspoons of wasabi, but it was from a regular store, not from a real Japanese food supplier. The cake is super moist and strange, but delicious. Also important to note is that I served 15 guests and almost a 1/3 of remains. Overall, it is amazing and definitely worth the time and effort.

Rating: 4
Although this cake may be difficult to make, it is worth the effort. Everyone one devoured it! I did have a problem with the cake falling and ended up serving it in a bowl. Still, just as good. Next time I will only make the two layers as others suggested. The ganache alone is decadent, I will probably try it on something else. The fresh ginger in the cake adds so much flavor. Also, if you haven't tried Vosges Truffles, they are the most heavenly taste you will ever try!

Rating: 3
Absolutely loved this cake--smash success for a birthday party. The ginger flavor was perfect but the wasabi was a bit too hidden so I will add more next time. Also, the ganache was a bit hard even with setting the cake out at room temperature. I may turn the ganache into a buttercream next time.

Rating: 3
I made this cake just to try it out because I was very interested in the combination of flavors in the recipe. However, what I got was a very good chocolate cake. Unless, you knew there was wasbi in it, I'm not sure you could have pulled out that flavor. The ginger was good but if I were to make this again, I would increase both the ginger and wasbi (maybe even adding paste wasabi instead of powder) to bring out those flavors.

I made this cake for our Asian Fusion theme gourmet club dinner. Everyone really enjoyed it! I could not readily find black sesame seeds, so I added about 1/4 tsp of Asian sesame seed oil to the ganache - it was a nice hint of flavor - but if you do this, definitely do not add more than that. I loved the texture of the ginger in the cake, and the whipped cream frosting made it seem very light and refreshing. I increased the wasabi powder to about 3/4 tsp, I think that was fine. I might cut back on the ginger if I make this again. The cake was nice and moist, would be delicious without the Asian additions as well.

I've made this cake 3 times since I saw the recipe in the magazine. (twice for my family, once for my recipe club at work) Everyone loved it! My only complaint. I couldn't taste the wasabi, even after increasing the amount. The ginger however, came through and nicely complemented the chocolate flavor in the cake. Also did not use the black sesame seeds, as I couldn't find them in the asian food store.

I thought this cake was awesome! My ganache was great and spreadable, the ginger syrup was good, the frosting light and yummy... I made 2-9" cakes so used 1/2 cup of syrup per layer (as suggested by another cook) and it was not soggy at all. The only problem I had was getting the cakes out of the pans. They ended up sticking and so I had 4 chunks. Yes, I did butter/flour the pan. Next time I will use parchment paper. However, I was able to piece the cake back together and no one knew anything had happened. I will make this cake again...even if it is just for me.

Well, for better or worse, I made this cake without the ginger, wasabi, or sesame seeds. I made it for our Valentine's family dinner and I knew my little nieces and nephews would balk at anything exotic. It was the best chocolate cake I have ever made, or eaten and it's in my "keeper" file for good. I think the technique of brushing sugar syrup between cake layers could be used in a lot of layer cakes and I'm glad to know about it. I had no trouble with the ganache even though I made it just a couple of hours before using it. I've made the cake twice now, and people just love it. Great recipe, and I'm sure one day I'll get around to the wasabi, ginger, and sesame!

Regarding the last rater's comment about ginger: I thought the ginger syrup was the best part of this cake, and I LOVED the finely minced chopped stewed ginger mixed throughout the cake. Maybe, as you say, you didn't mince it finely enough. Or perhaps you didn't cook it long enough in the sugar syrup, which makes it very, mellow. I liked the flavor of the whipped cream frosting, but texture-wise I agree that it's too light for the rest of the cake. Mostly I think the ganache was a little too heavy; whipping the ganache prior to layering would probably make it less of a stark contrast to the light outer frosting. Plus, it was hard to get one's fork through that ganache layer it was so hard. Overall, though, I think this is a very innovative dessert with fascinating, unusual flavors. BUT-- if you're looking for an even more spectacular (and easy) dessert, try the Deconstructed Black Forest Cake from the same January issue of Bon Appetit.

What a wonderful and interesting creation! I wonder what anyone else thinks about the chopped ginger in the cake batter - too overwhelming when bitten into? Maybe my pieces weren't chopped small enough, or did I misunderstand the recipe and it wasn't even supposed to be there?! Also, the very light frosting was lost on the dense cake. Did anyone try any modifications besides adding more ginger? Thankx!

This was one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made. It was moist, and the ginger was delicate enough to make it very interesting. I'd double the wasabi in the ganache, though. We didn't think the flavor was at all pronounced. That said, it was lovely, looked perfect.

I tested this for my husband's 40 bday party. It was very yummy however I did make some changes. I was worried about all the reviewers comments on how the cake was so opted for Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Cake. It is my all time favorite cake. Very easy and made in one bowl. Also only made 2 layers. Used ganache on both layers and refrigerated a few minutes then put on the whipped cream topping. Also used ready made wasabi and as other people said I will double that when I make it again. I could tell it had wasabi but want it to be more pronounced. Also I did not use all the syrup. The Hershey cake is very moist and was afraid it would be soggy. I used half of the syrup. I would also double the chopped ginger in the icing. This is the most unusual cake and fairly easy to make.

The flavor was interesting, but the cake was extremely dense. Not a cake that you would want a big slice of. Ate a third of it and toss the rest out. It was good to try it once.

So good!!! I used only 5 oz chocolate in the ganache, to make it a little softer. I also used regular sesame seeds and they tasted fine. I doubled the wasabi powder and still thought the flavor could have been stronger. Cake itself had perfect crumb. Will make this again.

I am rating this recipe before I make it because it sounds delish! I am having trouble finding the black sesame seeds. I can only find white. I live in a small town, but even ventured to the city and still can't find them. I am wondering if you can sub regular seeds for the black? If not, I will keep looking. I only have 6 days to find them...

I love the flavor of this cake, but mine came out much too dense and hard. The ganache, even at room temperature, was impossible to spread (I had to heat it up), and the cake itself was more like a dense fudge brownie. Even when I left the cake out for an hour to come to room remperature, I could hardly cut through it. It tasted great though! Has anyone else experienced this?

WOW! This recipe looks daunting with its many steps, but it is actually very straight-forward. I didn't have 3 cake pans, so I baked the cake in a large sheet pan and cut small circles with a round biscuit cutter to assemble single-serving cakes. The presentation was spectacular. I saved the leftover cake trimmings/syrup/ganache to make a Black Pearl trifle down the road (soak cake cubes in syrup, drizzle with ganache and layer with the ginger whipped cream). I made all the components 3 days ahead, which was super-convenient but may have altered the consistency of the cake. Under refrigerated storage, the cake became VERY dense and moist, almost fudge-like. I don't know if it would've been a more typical sponge had I stored it at room temp or made only one day ahead, but the fudge-like consistency made it even more truffle-like. I am now inspired to modify this recipe to mimic other Voges truffles using different aromatic spices. What fun!

One of the most UNIQUE choc. cakes you could make. Impressive. Was hesitant about the wasabi and sesame, but they meld well and create quite complex flavors that aren't too overwhelming. But I used less ginger root than called for, and didn't end up using all the syrup... seemed like it was too much saturation and I feared it would collapse. Thoughts? I wimped out. Next time I'll try it differently. Also, didnt have time to let the cakes / ganache rest as long as called for because of time, but still turned out great for a dinner party. Be sure not to beat the cream too long or it turns to butter. Fyi.

Not being much of a baker this was quite the undertaking for me, but worth the effort. Made this for a birthday party and it was a HUGE hit. I have already had requests. The flavor of this cake was wonderful and will be making this one again

Oh.....my.....god. This is one of the best cakes I've made and/or eaten in quite a while. The ingredient list and method may seem a little long, but the cake was actually very easy and straightforward to prepare. The texture and flavor were terrific. I took the previous posters suggestion and doubled the amount of wasabi powder in the ganache. Good call, the extra wasabi came through but was not overpowering. I did not have 3-8" cake pans so used 2-9" pans instead. I had to increase the baking time by 10 mintues, but the cake layers were just fine. Also, if making the cake in 2 layers instead of 3 use 1/2 cup of the ginger syrup on each layer. You will think you're overly saturating the layers, but not to worry, you're not. Ginger, wasabi and chocolate are all 3 strong, powerful flavors, but they blend so well together in this cake that each one compliments the other to create a wonderful, mellow chocolate dessert. This cake is a keeper and a winner!!

The unusual mix of ingredients makes a lovely, decadent cake - just like the vosges truffle that inspired it. I used bittersweet venezualan chocolate to make one of the best cakes I've ever had. This recipe goes in the keeper file. Other recipes from Vosges would be happily received!

Made this cake for a dinner party. Got rave reviews, but could hardly taste wasabi. Will double wasabi for next attempt. All in all, a great dessert.
