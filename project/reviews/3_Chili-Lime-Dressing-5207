Made this to go with the cucumber, radish and green onion salad on this site. Used honey instead of brown sugar, and added crushed red pepper to mine. Since everyone has their own spice preferences, I think the chili oil/pepper should be added to taste.

i'm sorry that it took so long to respond, but once i print out a recipe i usually don't go back to check the reviews. the chili lime dressing was served on an asian greens salad and served with seared ahi tuna.

i know it was 2 1/2 years ago, so it's probably not worth asking, but i have to ask, you served it with what?

this recipe was a wonderful change from the pedantic grind of boring dressings. we served it as the first course of a "lime theme" client luncheon and it was enthusiastically received.
