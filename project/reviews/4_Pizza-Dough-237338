'1 envelope' of yeast is a very annoying measurement when the brand isn't specified. I found a similar recipe for pizza dough and worked out that there should be about 1.13 teaspoons of yeast.

This dough needs to be cooked at 425ºF to have any semblance of pizza dough. If you don't cook it at high temperature, it won't work out for you. It's really easy to handle, quick to make, and a new favourite!

The flavour and texture are somewhere between cardboard and frozen boxed pizza. Try the "Overnight Pizza Dough" recipe instead - it has flavour and texture that will make every minute you spend waiting for it worth it.

This recipe has served me well many times. Yesterday I doubled the recipe and added a teaspoon of dried thyme and about that much fresh-ground pepper to the mix, and it worked very well. I find that the recipe as written makes enough dough for one 14" pizza. Cooked correctly, the crust is firm and crisp.

Very floury tasting. I put the pizza in the oven for an extra 10 minutes just to try to get the raw batter taste out and nothing helped. This recipe is enough to make a VERY small pizza, so either double the ingredients or go 50% minimum.

I have made better crusts over the years. I thought I would give this one a try. It was a bit dry, the texture was a bit bread like for me and like that of box frozen pizza. I prefer it to have a bit of a chewy NYC style like texture. I will not be making this one again, unfortunately.

I will never buy pizza dough again, as this recipe is so easy. I use a pizza stone - one of those fundraising party obligatory purchases, the crust turns out crispy, and doesn't stick. (I, too, thought the recipe was a little bland. So I replace some flour with whole wheat. I increase the salt to 1 tsp, and add 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning.) Homemade pizza is now a regular in the dinner rotation.

Have been trying diff dough and diff cooking techniques for some time. I have combined this dough recipe with the Jim Lahey style as described in My Bread. His no-knead dough is incredibly easy but makes more of a flatbread style than I like. Adding oil helps browning and crispness. I rise this dough in the fridge overnight. Preheat oven to 500F. Oil a rimmed baking sheet and stretch out dough with fingertips to fit.One dough recipe = one full sheet. 20-25 min usually depending on topping density. Turn halfway thru. Crisps without need to get stone, peel or use cornmeal.

Rating: 4
Amazingly easy! Dough was not sticky at all. Even my kids were able to roll it out to make their own pizzas. Baked 3 minutes @ 475 on a pizza stone before adding toppings. Then an additional 5 minutes. Turned out perfect! I subsituted the sugar for garlic powder.

This was good, and so easy. The recipe, for me, worked out well -- not too sticky at all, incredibly easy to work with (I used the dough blade on my Cuisinart), and puffed up really nicely. This was still not a very thin, crispy, nor very bubbly crust (so if you're looking for that, move on), but it crisped up well. MY NOTES: I made two batches, as we were looking to make two pretty good size pizzas. Each ball of dough was light and airy and looked good with all of its little air pockets. So proud of myself. During the first round, however, we had a pizza-transfer disaster (still tasted awesome) As a note to pizza-making novices like I am, kitchens are in dire need of a pizza "wood peel" in order to successfully transfer any beautiful creations from counter-top to oven pizza stone. Second round was more of a success -- used all of the dough to make about a fourteen - sixteen inch round, built it on aluminum foil, and then baked it on the foil atop the stone. And thanks to cornmeal, it slid right off the foil. Until I find a dough that makes a thinner more bubbly crust, this is my go-to.

Definitely easy to handle, but overall too crispy for my taste and relatively flat on flavor.

A very easy recipe! I have made homemade breads and pizza doughs for years, and this is the easiest pizza dough I have made in a while! The food processor is the perfect tool for the job. As for texture, this dough is flexible...if you prefer thin, crispy crust, use a rolling pin and get it super thin. If you prefer a doughy texture, just put olive oil on the bottom of the pan and then roll it out a little thicker (1/4 inch thick). I added 1 t. sea salt and 1/2 t. garlic powder. Recipe is for about one large pizza.

I've been making pizza for many years and I am exploring new recipes with my teenage son (and with new ovens also). I would try this again with maybe half the olive oil. But the dough was easy to work with (it is more 'push into shape' dough than roll out dough). Personally we prefer a pizza with a stronger texture. This was somewhat crunchy, but more biscuity-crunchy than french bread-crunchy. The teenage son did make it in the cuisinart bread machine. We precooked the crusts for 5 minutes. One of them we pricked with a fork before cooking after experiencing too much dough puffiness on the first. So the second was different, depending on who in the family ate it, better or worse. This may be moot if you are not precooking the crust. I will continue to look for, and will try this one again also with more experimentation.

Rating: 4
Very good and easy to work with. I made this in a bread machine at dough setting and since I wanted to make 2 pizzas, altered the ingredients as follow: 1 1/2 c warm water, 2 1/2 teas dry yeast, 2 c bread flower, 2 c all purpose flour, 2 t sugar, 1 1/2 t salt 3 T olive oil. For added flavor, I added a clove of minced garlic and 1 1/2 t fresh rosemary chopped. Assembled pizzas about 3 hours eating. Brought to room temp before cooking. Excellent!

I have been making pizza dough from scratch for around 11 years. This IS my new stand-by. I followed directions exactly and cooked in a pan in the oven. The crust was similar to Pagliacci's Pizza in Seattle. A little chewy, a little crispy, and on the thin side. YUM!

Love this recipe. And love it MORE now when I use HIGH GLUTEN ORGANIC unbleached flour. WOW! What a difference. If you think it is airy and fluffy, try this flour. I use the brand by Bob's Red Mill.

SO EASY. i thought for sure the food processor would be a horrific mess after pouring oil and yeasty water into a couple cups of flour but no! to my surprise [not to mention delight], it balled up nicely and only took a sprinkling of extra flour to keep it from gluing itself to the cutting board upon removing it from the mixer. lacking a pizza pan, it cooked up brilliantly on a cookie sheet. so much better than the Trader Joe's goo-in-a-bag i had been buying. i'd give this one 11 forks if i could. huzzah!

My boyfriend and I tried this recipe out one night. We loved it. For a really flavorful and fresh crust I highly recommend adding fresh oregano and thyme to the mixture. Also I highly suggest broiling the pizza dough (once laid out on the pan) for about 2 min. then add all your sauce and ingredients and bake until golden. At the end if you want a crispy crust on top but soft on the inside broil again for 1 min. If you want 2 med. pizzas I would double this recipe.

I loved how easy this was. It was my first time making pizza dough and I was surprised how simple and fast it was. This is a definitely a dough that should be rolled out thinly, it didn't taste nearly as good thick as it did thin.

Rating: 3
This is good and gets bonus points for being so easy to work with. The texture is not authentic pizza dough; it's too airy and bready for that. It's not crispy like a thin crust either. However, it is easy to make, doesn't require overnight proofing and tastes good. Would probably be best used as foccacia bread or crust for sicilian pizza.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a great dough. I ended up dividing the dough into 8 pieces and rolling them each about 1/8" thick into rectangles (approx. 5"-6" x 11") with rounded corners. Overall it gave me about 3 pizzas worth and enough to feed about 5-6 people considering the thinness of the crust. The dough was fairly sticky after rising so I found it helpful to sprinkle the board I was rolling on _and_ my nonstick rolling pin with flour. Once I did that, the dough was like a dream. After I topped them I baked the pizzas on a nonstick pizza pan with holes in it at 425F for 11-14 minutes. I'm planning on making this dough again and rolling it out ahead of time for a make-your-own pizza party/game night. The pizzas were so great and the crusts so thin that I'm sure even my carb-conscious friends won't mind.

Good recipe. I use this as my pizza dough. Works best on a heated pizza stone. I've also put it on the grill. I double the sugar and yeast.

Rating: 0
Several suggestions if I may. Eliminate the sugar...no need for it. Yeast cannot utilize white sugar as food...substitute honey, about 1 tsp. The real trick to making authentic Neapolitan pizza is a long slow cool rise. Make dough as suggested, oil a bowl [and dough], cover with plastic wrap loosely and place in refigerator overnight. The dough will only slightly rise [maybe about 1 1/2 times it's original size]. Re-knead and allow to rise an additional hour in a warm place. Continue from this point. Your results will be much better! Also, if you can find 00 flour [specialty stores], use this instead of bread or AP flour!

This was a very easy and quick recipe. Although I think it would be better suited to a fococcia recipe. Maybe with some carmelized onions and rosemary? My husband and I prefer our crust super thin, and this rose just a little too much. I'll make it again, but not for pizza!

This is a great classic pizza dough recipe and good for rolls as well. HINT: To get a little more "bite" to the crust, add about 1 Tablespoon of semolina flour. (It's what's used in pasta and crusty Italian and French breads.) Also dust your pan or pizza stone with semolina flour before laying the dough on it.

I wasn't sure about this due to mixed reviews but I have to say that we really enjoyed this. I had to split the dough due to a cheese allergy for my son. I cooked sausage,red onion and black olives with fresh mozzarella. Cooked at 450 for 18mins on a baking sheet.:)

This is delicious! I've made it twice now and can't wait to make it again. I used 1 cup bread flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. I baked the crust at 425 on the top rack for 12 minutes.

I have been searching for the perfect pizza dough recipe... and this is it. I made a few changes and have included a few suggestions: I rubbed my hands with a small amount of vegetable oil before kneading the dough and ended up adding about 2 additional tablespoons of flour while kneading. I used bread flour rather than all purpose flour (which made the crust thicker, I don't really like thin crusts). When ready to use the dough I rolled it out between two sheets of parchment paper... no mess to clean up! Also, I sprinkled about 1/4 cup of shredded aged Cheddar on top of the dough before baking it at 450' for 5 minutes, using a pizza stone. I then added the toppings and baked for an additional 18-20 minutes. Perfect!

I was really looking forward to making this pizza crust based on the positive reviews. I've never made pizza crust from scratch before so maybe the disaster was my fault. But, the dough was incredibly sticky at first. I probably had to add about an extra cup of flour (1 Tbsp at a time!) before I could work with it at all. It was stuck all over my fingers. What a mess! Finally it got to the point where I could work with it. I set it aside to rise for an hour, but it didn't seem to rise at all--maybe my yeast was bad... I precooked the crust for about 8 minutes before adding the toppings. Then, I had to let it cook for more than another half an hour because the texture was still so doughy. The final texture was too chewy and odd. I will probably try this recipe again, but adding at least 1/2 cup extra flour to start and maybe a little less olive oil. And maybe I'll try a different kind of yeast.

A pretty good dough recipe, although a little too "bready" for my taste. My test subjects said it was good, but I could tell by the leftovers, there was a need for some tweaking. So I made it again, using 1 1/3 cups all purpose flour and 2/3 cups of high gluten flour. I also let it rise in the refrigerator for 24 hrs. The second batch was much more elastic, I was able to roll out very thin, topped, baked and it came out perfectly. It received raves from all, but most telling was the lack of leftovers. Im not sure if it was the high gluten flour or the 24 hour rest period, or both, that made the difference, but it was definitely an improvement.
