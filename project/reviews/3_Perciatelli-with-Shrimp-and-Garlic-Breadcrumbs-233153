I incorporated the recipe from briansnat from Morris County NJ for our first try. Enjoyed this dish enormously! Served it Christmas Eve 2008. I pulsed the anchovies with oil and additional butter and added the mixture just before mixing. I make my own pasta but even with store-bought this would have made a great supper dish. The garlic crumbs are wonderful.

This was so tasty! I only used 1/2 of the bread crumbs, and I am so glad because I am going to be making this in a few more days!

Another compliment from a speculative husband. I found that the zest from one lemon only amounted to two teaspoons so I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon to the pasta water. I also used store-bought breadcrumbs, so I had moist, but not soggy cubes.

This was disappointing. It wasn't dry as folks mentioned but just plain old blah! Even with all the garlic...which I hesitated to use at first but went with it anyway. What really disappointed me was how the wonderful, crunchy, golden, garlic breadcrumbs turned to mush once they were tossed in the dish...I even kept some off and served on the side, like I would normally serve grated cheese. Again even those turned to mush....next time I will just make alio oglio and toss in a few capers and shrimp...would be more flavorful..

Linquini with garlic breadcrumbs was long a standby of mine. I noticed this version here. There were some differences between this one and my own. Mine used a can of rinsed, finely chopped anchovy fillets and 4 tbsp of butter in addition to the olive oil. Mine didn't use shrimp shrimp or capers. The rest was pretty much similar. I tried this, adding the anchovy and butter from my personal recipe and the results were outstanding! I might lighten up on the ground lemon rind and cut it down to about a teaspoon of lemon zest, but other than that, nearly perfect. I really like what the shrimp and capers added to the dish. I've already made the changes to my own recipe.

This is an excellent pasta. I made the recipe exactly as written and didn't find the dish at all dry. My eleven year old son couldn't get enough of it. Don't compare this to a typical American red-saucy pasta dish; enjoy it for what it is. Sliced tomatoes with mozzarella, fresh basil, a twist of ground pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil complement this dish perfectly.

I'm not an American (I'm Asian) but I have to admit that I, too, apparently like a sauce-y pasta. I had to drink a lot of water with this pasta to get it down. I wish I'd taken the advice of the first comment and halved the breadcrumbs, maybe even quartered them

This was a nice change from typical drown in tomato or cream sauce pasta recipes. I made it one night during a desperation dinner moment using half the amount of dry, homemade breadcrumbs. It was fast, easy and a big hit with my fussy 11 year old!

OK, I admit it, I am one of those ugly Americans who likes really sauce-y pasta. So sue me - it's the American way, LOL! I made this last night taking everyone else's warnings about sauced pasta into account. After I grated the peel off the lemon, I squeezed the juice over the shrimp as they sauteed. When they were not quite done, I pulled them from the pan, splashed in some dry white wine and let it reduce to a sauce. I didn't add any leftover pasta water, but also added some chopped fresh spinach (which also added some moisture) to make this a one dish meal. It was not too sauce-y and my husband thought it was a nice change with the breadcrumbs adding crunchiness.

YUM! By the Way: I'm an American, my parents are American, my grandparents were American.....and darn it....I don't want a saucy pasta! I eat dry pasta and I am proud of it! Next someone will say "I find that Americans like their sauce to come in a jar labeled Prego". Don't get me wrong I am sure there are many people who like their pasta "saucier", but geez why make it America vs. THE WORLD thing.

This is good, I've been eating similar dishes for years. I think maybe you were a little hard on the other reviewer Lutine. He never said a thing about cream sauce he just simply said it was dry to him. Can't tell you myself if it was dry as I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I look at recipes as suggestions. If it seemed to dry, try the extra olive oil a splash of white wine is also a nice touch if you happen to have some around. That said I have found that Americans tend to like their pasta a bit more saucier than you would find in Italy where the sauce just clings to the pasta, not covers it. It is hard for many American taste buds to get use to. So don't, just add more sauce. The point is to enjoy. OH, cime di rape is turnip greens, broccoli rabe is also a nice addition as is kale, escarole or even spinach. My grandmother use to make a similar dish with rasins and pine nuts (pignoli) but no shrimp (it ain't Kosher), I can't remember what she used as a meat tho. Maybe she didn't use anything. Point is, this is a great dish to build on.

Just a note to the above review. In Italy we don't always prepare pasta smothered in creamy sauces. If you are in Naples and order spaghetti alla marinara (which is NOT the marinara sauce used in the US with tomato and garlic, but it's basically spaghetti with clams, seafood, muscles etc) you will get a simple dish with pasta and seafood, some oil and parsley, that's all. Same thing if you go to Puglia and order "orecchiette con le cime di rapa". Many pasta recipes are simple and for some can be defined as "dry" because they don't have a creamy sauce, but that's because their origin comes from what people had in their house (and few had heavy cream available).I am italian, I have prepared this recipe (with a few ingredient variations like I added cime di rapa (I don't know which is the english translation for that, sorry)or broccoli in bits, and my guests and I liked it a lot. I usually sprinkle some good extra virgin olive oil and freshly grated Grana Padano on the dished pasta.

This dish was extremely dry. I increased the water that I added by two cups and still it was to dry. Maybe if you added some olive oil to this it would be better. Neither my wife nor I liked this recipe. I will not make this again.
