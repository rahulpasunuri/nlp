I was looking for a meat-free show-stopper and this is it! I was more generous with the oil, spices and ginger, and added garlic slivers to the roasting pan. I also cut the shallots into medium lengthwise strips and they roasted up to a delicious caramelized crisp -- really giving the dish its depth. The walnuts and lentils bring superb nubbliness, and the lime and cilantro are mandatory. This will be a great main dish next time, served with basmati rice and a salad. Yum!

Definitely a keeper! I followed the advice of other reviewers and upped the amount of curry powder and lentils; also swapped out for pine nuts and added goat cheese. I did not have lime juice so used lemon, but I think the lime would really have added some nice zip. Will definitely make again!

I loved the flavors and it was so easy with pre-peeled and sliced squash from the store. But, I used red lentils and they quickly became mush. Have others used other kinds that hold together better?

Until now, I thought i didn't love butternut squash. This recipe was SCARY good....I had reservations about the lime juice, but it MADE the dish. Will serve this to my Vegan guests!

This is shockingly delicious. I did a couple of subs, acorn squash for butternut, pine nuts for walnuts, and added in some sauteed cabbage. the cabbage added a really nice texture. didn't have any cilantro.

Great recipe. Lime juice and yogurt are a must. I did what others suggested: tripled lentils, doubled curry powder (and used hot curry powder), added cumin and 4 garlic cloves and as always, more cilantro. Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow.

This recipe has become one of our family favorites that has been passed along to others. I have made this many times as the recipe was written. I do make the following alterations. I put a bit of curry in my lentils while they cook for added flavor and use extra lentils. Red onion tastes very similar to shallots. I do not add them to the butternut squash until 10 min. into the cooking time to avoid overcooking and burning them. We like a bit of extra curry in the overall dish. This is excellent even without any adjustments!!

I will likely make this again, but I did follow many suggestions from the other reviewers such as adding garlic, doubling the lentils and curry powder, definitely needed the yogurt and probably more as I thought it was still dry. Still wasn't thrilled about the taste and then remembered the lime juice. Then lastly added just a sprinkling of brown sugar and was satisfied. --Any suggestions to make it not so dry, yogurt helped but still seemed pastey.

I really liked this. Added minced fresh ginger to the squash before cooking. And i tripled the lentils. as another reviewer mentionned, the shallot does burn a bit while roasting, but I only had to discard the ones at the edges of the pan. Would probably be really good with dollop of yogourt or maybe goat cheese crumbled on top.

I substituted whipped acorn squash & rice for butternut because it was 'leftover' in fridge. I juiced 1/2 a lime & increased cilantro a bit too. Served with ground veal/pork kebabs....YUM

Excellent. My squash spends more time in the oven, but other than that I keep to the recipe, roughly speaking. Easy to make, super healthy and colorful.

Rating: 3
This was a really great side dish at dinner last night, very tasty with the lime juice and the curry powder. Next time I think I would double the walnuts to vary the flavors and texture a bit, and also you have to be careful that it doesn't sit too long, especially not covered, because then the whole dish ends up brown and lentil-colored instead of with vibrant yellow and green accents.

Rating: 4
It was awsome. Try it with or without the lime juice. It is super spicy right off the oven then taste subsides after it cools down which gives it another flavor. I also tried it on the stove, without baking the butternut squash & etc and it came out just as good.

OMG!!!!! Glad I doubled the recipe. I have not served it yet, but I have been picking at this dish. Fabulous. If my family does not like it, there will be more for me. Definitely a due over.

I made this with french lentils, and pan fried them a touch after boiling so they would be a little crispy, I also used pecans and parsely instead of walnuts and cilantro. Most excellent and very filling with brown rice.

Rating: 3
This is a great dish. I left out the nuts as I was hoping my son would eat it. I will add them next time. The recipe says that the lime is optional. I would highly recommend it. It makes a big difference in the flavor. I would like to try this with sweet potato instead of squash as some people have suggested.

Rating: 4
What a surprise! This was super tasty, filling and very healthy! I made some modifications to the recipe, though. I baked the squash 30 minutes alone, covered in foil with slits to let steam escape. Meanwhile, I sauteed the shallot in a little olive oil (1 tbsp) and added another half an onion. After they were soft and translucent, I added this mixture plus 1 cup of walnuts (double the amount the recipe called for) to the squash in the oven. I mixed it up a bit, then returned it uncovered to the oven to bake for another 15-20 minutes. I doubled the lentils and only cooked those for 10 minutes to avoid mushyness. I doubled the spice (since I didn't have curry powder, I used cumin, ginger, garam masala, cayenne and turmeric to equal about 3 tsp of dried spice), doubled the cilantro and was generous with lemon juice (didn't have lime on hand). Liberal salt and pepper after I mixed everything together at the end. WONDERFUL. Will definitely be making this again and again.

I really liked this recipe, and didn't do much tweaking. I used regular onion, and lemon instead of lime because that's what I had. Next time, though, I certainly WON'T be putting the onion and squash together in the oven because a lot of the onion burned and I had to fish out the non-scorched bits by hand. I'll be sauteeing those separately from now on. I upped the curry content and added a little cumin. What this dish seemed to need was yogurt (which some folks mentioned) so I made a sort of yogurt sauce with yogurt, garlic, cilantro and S&P and drizzled it over the veggies on basmati rise. I had some leftover French's onions from Thanksgiving and used them as a garnish for some crunch (oh, hush, now) VERY nice recipe, and flexible, too!

Rating: 4
Made this tonight and LOVED it! It's going on the regular list, as healthy, high-protein/low-carb vegetarian meals that taste good are so hard to come by. And it's so flexible! I expect to do a lot of tinkering, but for tonight I did this: Tripled the lentils Doubled the curry Added a block of sauteed extra-firm tofu Added four cloves of garlic Used parsley instead of cilantro Used lemon instead of lime Stirred in a few spoonfuls of plain nonfat yogurt just before serving, as it seemed rather dry.

Loved the varied flavors and textures in this recipe. I mixed in a cup of brown rice to make it a veggie entree. I added wine to the lentils because I didn't have lime juice and used some fresh parsley for the cilantro with good results. Also added a leftover dribble of half-and-half because the dish looked dry, but I like the idea of a dollop of yogurt. Will make this again and again--great way to vary the presentation of both squash and lentils.

I've made this dish several times, but with extra spice and with plain, old yellow onion in place of the shallot. Very tasty and filling. A great vegetarian addition to the repertoire.

I made this as a vegetarian main course and I loved it! My 2 year old also devoured it which is a huge bonus! I subbed red onions for the shallots, and pecans for the walnuts. I spiced it as written since I was also making it for a toddler. I could have used more curry for myself, but it was not at all bland the way it was written. Overall, a solid weeknight dish!

Really quite nice, and very filling. I served it over brown & wild rice. To dkaczmarek from Rosemount, MN: I owe you one. Your tip about microwaving the squash before peeling saved me not only a lot of time and effort, but quite possibly a couple of fingers!

This was great! I also increased the curry as others had advised. if you have a Trader Joe's in your area you can often purchase the squash pre-cut, will go much faster. This is a very South Beach Diet friendly recipe!

Pretty good. Like other reviewers, I doubled the curry and added two cloves of garlic. Nice side dish, or main course if served with naan.

Delicious! I doubled the curry powder and it was perfect. A little time consuming to peel the squash, but worth the effort. I doubled it for a vegetarian lunch for 4 and served with mixed greens. The cilantro and lime juice at the end add just the right touch. Next time I will try water chestnuts instead of walnuts to cut down on fat content. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was fine, but I wasn't wildly thrilled with the results. My biggest complaint is that I found the spice to be rather lackluster, though perhaps this could be fixed with a bit of experimentation. I wouldn't recommend multiplying this recipe by a large number, as the butternut squash becomes quite a chore and cooks very slowly.

Flavorful, complex, and very satisfying. I added a bit of garlic, and baked the squash longer than the recipe calls for. I will be making this again.

Absolutely delicious - great texture - and, as a vegetarian, this is a keeper. Have made it several times but I always use plenty of garlic and diced onions, sauteed, and butter. Really yummy - am glad I have found this recipe. Have made it several times and will keep making it. You must try it and don't be afraid to put your own touch to it.

This recipe came highly recommended by vegetarian daughter. The meat-eaters in the household REALLY like it--especially with daughter's recommendation of a bit more curry and a dollop of plain yogurt to finish the dish. IMPORTANT! Having learned the hard way about the perils of peeling winter squash, I URGE folks to try this method: Stab the squash two or three times, then pop it in the microwave and nuke it for about a minute and one-half--perhaps longer, depending on the size of the squash--rotating squash halfway through nuking time. Peeling will be vastly less difficult and far less dangerous. And for most dishes there's no discernible difference in time needed to cook the squash.

the pumpkin was undercooked after 40 mins, and the lentils werent very flavorful but the results were ok.

Oh my, YUMMY! Just made this for dinner with what I had on hand: sweet potato instead of squash, pecans instead of walnuts, onions instead of shallots. Served with quinoa as another reviewer recommended, and some kale that I seasoned with a bit of cardamom and allspice to compliment the curry powder. It was also quite easy to prepare (though peeling a butternut squash can give you carpal tunnel syndrome -- next time I'll try the prepped squash I've seen at Trader Joe's).

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner. Instead of squash though, I added roasted sweet potatoes. I then stuffed the mixture into roasted acorn squashes to make a main meal. Wonderful. Also to move away from the curry flavor I instead added chipotle powder to the roasting veggies.

This is a very good recipe and one that can be made into a vegetarian main dish by adding a grain to complete the protein. I added a little brown sugar and mixed in left-over quinoa wich complemented the flavors nicely. The dish is extradorinarly healthty-- I am a Dietitian and would feel comfortable recommending to my clients.

I clipped this recipe when it first appeared but never got around to making it, since I was afraid it might be a little too weird. I finally tried it, though, and it was delicious. Aside from chopping the squash, it's not much work, and easy to multiply. I had it over rice for dinner, and I'm thinking I'll probably make it again as something different for Thanksgiving. Great for vegetarians. The walnuts, squash, and shallots give it a really rich flavor, and it's quite filling.

This was really good. Unfortunately, it could be better the next time I make it. I did not follow to the T. I added plenty of diced garlic and turmeric in addition to the salt, pepper and curry. That was good. Then I added plenty of olive oil - next time a little less so that the squash mixture crips rather than almost simmering. Then I decided to add yellow split peas (I think they were peas) in addition to almost one cup of lentils. OK - the end result was not what it should be - it was more of a "mush" rather than a dish with "separate" ingrediants but, it was delicious. Next time just lentils, less cooked and less olive oil.

I'd suggest adding some more lentils and some more curry powder (although certainly not too much of the latter as it tends to dominate the mild flavour of the squash. The lime juice is just great with it.

Make sure that you test the tenderness of your squash before you take it out of oven. I relied on timing and forgot to check. It was delicious nonetheless. I zapped it in the microwave before serving. Very nutritious and little effort.

I think that this recipe is very good. The curry goes so well with the other ingredients. My only complaint is that it was slightly dry.
