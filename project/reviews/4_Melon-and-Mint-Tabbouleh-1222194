This is a very very tasty salad. I added chopped artichoke hearts to give it more substance. I think it balances out the sweetness of the melons well.

Wow! A wonderful change from the usual Tabbouleh, especially here in the dog days of summer when honeydews are so good. I made this for a dinner group and doubled the recipe exactly as written, which is kind of rare for me. As another cook said, it's important to slice the onion very thin, and I soaked the onion in ice water for half an hour after I sliced it to take some of the heat out (cutting it made me cry!) Really pretty garnished with a bunch of mint.

This was very good. Very important to make sure the onion is sliced very thin. Next time I would reduce the amount of onion as well.

I made this with cantaloupe over my family's summer vacation. Everyone liked it, and it was my three-year-old nephew's favourite -- he made sure it was Auntie's tabbouleh before he would take any.

I love this recipe and have made it many, many times. I have used canteloupe as well as honey dew melon. Both are great.

Very tasty and refreshing. I doubled the recipe to get 8 side dishes. Prepared it in the morning and let it sit in the fridge all day. Will do this again.

This was light and refreshing. Because the tastes are so subtle, it improved after it sat for a few hours. It's an intriguing variation on the usual tabbouleh. The colour is fairly neutral so I added slices of honeydew melon and lime as garnish to liven it up visually. I probably should have added some finely sliced red onion to the garnish as well.
