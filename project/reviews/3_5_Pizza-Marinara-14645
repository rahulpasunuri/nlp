I thought this was good and I'd definitely make it again. I think that it's a good starting point and that you can interpret it in many ways. I added a bit of mozarella cheese, which I preferred to just the sauce.

Made recipe almost exactly following recipe, just added green olives, pepperoni and mozzerella cheese. It was awesome though. So good I took a picture. The crust and sauce were perfect. I'll definately make this again.

Very easy and very good...made the crust and the sauce...but added what we like to the pizza...such as fresh mushrooms, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese...want to make it again with other topping.

To be honest, I didn't make this exact recipe. I used a favorite pizza crust recipe (similar, but made less dough), this pizza sauce recipe, and added a little parmesan. I cannot rave about the pizza sauce recipe enough. It MADE the pizza. Give it a try!

This is a fast simple pizza that's great for either an appetizer before a larger meal, or on it's own. A hungry person could easily eat a whole one though, so be prepared! =)
