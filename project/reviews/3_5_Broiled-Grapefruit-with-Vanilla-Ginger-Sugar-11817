Very simple. refreshing and light dessert. I only cooked my for 6 minutes and they were almost over done.

one of my all time favs; i have been making this for 7 years now! williams-sonoma carries the nielsen-massey madagascar vanilla PASTE which makes this whole thing work out sooo much better...gives you lots of little vanilla specks without the hassle. use food proc instead of grinder, or just chop chop & mix. amp with a 1/4 t. ground ginger & a little lemon zest for a bit of zing. love it!

We love this recipe. It is a fantastic dessert in winter. It is light and healthy which makes it a perfect finish for a heavy meal. I blend the sugar, ginger and liquid vanilla in the blender and it works just fine.

I attempted to make the vanilla ginger sugar in my coffee/spice grinder which was a disaster. The crystalized ginger is moist and does not grind up fine ... when I added the vanilla, it was obviously not correct to use vanilla extract, but the recipe doesn't say vanilla BEAN, which is dry ... so I used vanilla extract which was awful. Instead, I looked up broiled grapefruit in The Joy of Cooking which had a very straightforward recipe that was very similar, only it calls for sugar and ground ginger ... no vanilla at all. I am making the Joy recipe for a brunch tomorrow. This should have been easy, but I found it to be a waste of time and perfectly good crystalized ginger!

this recipe is fantastically easy. the heat mellows out the grapefruit just enough: it still tastes grapefruity, but with a little less of that puckering edge. to make it easy enough for a weekday breakfast, i simply top it with molasses sugar. i've served this to people who love grapefruit and people who are lukewarm about it, and both groups gave it a thumbs up.

Normally I like to leave well enough alone, and I have always loved the clean simplicity of grapefruit, but I prepared the broiled grapefruit for a small brunch and it was a big hit. I have since made it several more times, and have, of course, experimented with the toppings (adding such things as nutmeg, brown sugar, fresh mint, maple syrup etc) and have always liked the results.
