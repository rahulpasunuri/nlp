This was easy and delicious! The mint helps take away some of the egg smell--I always use it in frittatas. Like another reviewer, I too bought the mushrooms from the farmer's market and used fresh mint from our garden. This simple dish is wonderful for Sunday lunch, I will certainly make again.

I used 2 T of butter in addition to the olive oil and I added one more clove of garlic. I just happened to have 3/4 lb of wild mushrooms just purchased from the Farmer's Market. This was delicious and everybody in my house loved it. I served it with some crusty bread.

Totally blah. I put in less mushrooms than called for and more salt, and I added cracked black pepper, and it was still boring. The mushrooms seemed to completely overpower the mint and you couldn't even taste it. I thought this dish was ok but definitely wouldn't make it again. My husband, who is usually easy to please, didn't finish his portion and ate something else for the rest of his dinner. It was easy to make, at least.

So easy to make and really delicious. I would never have thought to mix mint with mushroom. Makes a great lunch or light supper with some crusty bread or fruit or salad. I have made this several times, substituting basil for mint one time and that was delicious as well. Any easy lunch you can whip up in minutes!

I used baby portabella's because that is what I had on hand. Added a little heavy cream. And, with a touch of fresh mint...it turned out delish!

I made this when we were having people over for drinks and light finger food. People claimed to like it but I think they were being polite. I found it very unspectacular and lacked flavor, despite the mint.

Tasty and easy. Concur 1 lb. mushrooms is probably too much, I used about three-fourths lb. and it was just right.

Used 3/4lb of the Trader Joe's frozen Wild Mushroom Medley, and this was great! Substituated fresh basil for mint. My 1st fritttata, this is a simple recipe!

Excellent - I used dried chanterelles and fresh crimini, and served it on a bed of greens with a simple dressing of olive oil, lemon, oregano, salt and pepper. A fresh, but filling, first course. Sancerre or a crisp Italian white.

This frittata turned out ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. 1 pound of mushrooms for this recipe is ridiculous. I used 3/4 pounds wild mushrooms, and it was still too much. I suggest using 1/2 pound of mushrooms, 3 garlic cloves, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Use the mint as a garnish in the end, as the cooking process takes away a lot of its flavor. Don't over sautee, or the eggs might stick to the pan when you try to take the frittata out.
