Love this recipe, so flavorful and satisfying, works great with chicken too. A lovely meal for a casual dinner party or any night of the week.

Absolutely loved this. Would definitely make it again. I had pork chops, so pan cooked them and reduced the sauce in the pan. Made mainly mashed potatoes with some celery root (so my kids would eat it). The sauce is amazing -- but I cut down the cayenne to 1/2 tsp, and it was hot enough for us. Lentils - yum, and especially good with the sauce drizzled over them.

This was different in a good way. Where I live, celery root is such an oldfashioned, pedestrian, and somewhat overlooked vegetable that finding interesting recipes can be a challenge. Cooking it in milk and serving it with a lentil stew worked really well - and since those parts of the dish can be made ahead - a super guest dinner as well. I had to make a radical change to the meat though, since I would be eating it all alone - i.e. a single serving. So I mixed the sauce and put it in my slow cooker with a pork chop (2-3 cm thick slices of pork tenderloin would work well, too, perhaps better) and gave it 5.5 hours on low. Not all that moist but very tender. I served it with coarsely shredded horseradish sprinkled over - it added a fresh edge to the spicyness and suited the celery very well.

Wow, it tasted like something from a fancy restaurant! I added one potato to thicken up the celeriac puree, but it was still a little runny. Tasted heavenly though. I got a lean cut of pork, so it wasn't as juicy as I like. The sauce ties everything together in this dish. Next time I will get a better cut of pork. Not difficult to make at all, just a lot of steps. Highly recommend if you want to impress

This recipe rocks! We are members of a CSA and often get different vegetables such as celery root that we need recipes for. We're also trying to include more legumes into our meals. I love that parts can be done ahead of time, and that you can choose to do only the celery root or only the legumes, or even only the tenderloins; they can all stand on their own as great recipes. A little bit of work, not too much. Everything was very flavorful. My only change was I didn't need to add milk to the celery root mash - the consistency was perfect without it. Will definitely be making this again.

We made this tonight and thought it was pretty good. It was a little bit of work so might not be good for a rushed evening. The changes we made to the recipe were to use a mixture of celeriac, turnips & potatoes for the puree, onions instead of shallots in the lentils and half as much cayenne pepper in the honey sauce. Next time we'll probably try to cut out some of the butter as the lentils and sauce didn't seem to need it.

I've made this several times and love it! You can do so much ahead that putting it all together is breeze and totally delicious. A winner!

Lovely, and so perfect for a New England autumn meal. Thank you, Sarah!

Very nice flavor combo! I only had 1 celery root and simply boiled it in water with a couple of potatoes (threw the root in 5 mins before the potatoes) then mashed them with some lite cream and butter. I didn't make the lentils (no time) but will next time as this dish was excellent. Loved the sauce for it's nice heat. A keeper!

I only made the celery root puree, but wanted to throw my two cents in that it was fantastic, easy, and got raves from my husband. Will use this simple and delicious recipe again!

I made the celery root and the lentils. The lentils were ok - nothing special - but tasty. The celery root was like glue, really awful. Not recommended.

Actually I only made the mashed celeriac to use with another recipe. It was delicious; however I used cilantro instead of the celery greens because it's what I had and it went nicely with the rest of the meal. However this recipe sounds intriguing (as I love lentils) so I will definately make as written soon.

Made this last night - delicious. Had to add a couple of boiled potatoes and beat them into the celeryroot puree to thicken, as it would have been to soppy. Otherwise unusually for me, followed recipe exactly; an interesting and different supper. Well worth trying and I will definitely make again.

Absolutley lovely, can't find the celery root in the little town i'm in, so i substituted potatoes, with half a sweet potato, and a pear roasted and then mashed . Also threw a little red wine to the sauce for the meat. Everyone loved it!

I made this for Valentine's Day -yes, my husband is too cheap to take me out ;) - and it was delicious. I'm always scared about pork being dry but this was juicy. But what really got me was boiling the celery root/celeriac in milk - it was so creamy, you don't have to add cream when mashing. Instead of the kinda runny, yellowish celeriac mash you usually get, this was a beautiful soft white pillow on which the spicy and sweet pork could rest. Please try the recipe as is, it's fab.

Really tasty. The sweetness of the pork and sauce are nicely counterbalanced by the savoury flavour of the lentils. I prefer a celeriac + potato mash (2/3 celeriac and 1/3 potato) to a plain celeriac mash which is a little too watery for my taste. I used 1 tsp not the suggested 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and that was plenty.

We altered this recipe a bit, didn't use any of the spices for the pork. Instead we used some cumin, coriander, and rubbed it with garlic. We also added some chicken stock to the celeriac puree to thin it out a bit, it turned an okay puree into something fantastic. The lentils we cooked as is. We also made a quick pan sauce of chicken stock, honey, the pork drippings and a bit of sherry to place over the pork. Fantastic!!! All together the dish was incredible! The leftovers were even better.

Fabulous! I am giving it 4 forks with this reccomendation--I would at least 1/2 the cayenne and in fact, next time around I may use an all together different spice. The spice overpowered the mild nature of the pork. Every other component and the grilling of the pork itself was perfection.

I thought this was a real good'n. Spicy and sweet. All the folks at the Trailer Park liked it 'cept for Irvin-Dean. He liked the plain meat though. Sprinky and Jackie ate it up!

Wow!! Made for New Years and got rave reviews. I might cut down on the cayenne pepper because it was spicy (and I like spicy!). But a great keeper! Never made celery root before and I think the puree is better than mashed potatoes.

What makes this dish so special is the honey/curry sauce and the tenderness of the tenderloin. An excellent recipe.

This was Christmas dinner this year and it was wonderful. Doing the lentils and celery root ahead of time is a good idea. Without the pork it would be a great meatless entree, though I'd still serve a little sauce with it.

Everything went together so well and it was easy to make. Being able to make the lentils and the celery root puree ahead was a real bonus. Everyone in our gourmet group loved it. I have made it several times since then... it's fabulous!

This meal was very good. It was so great to make because all of the dishes were part of this one recipe. The sauce was very tasty, and very spicy. I would definitly make this again. It is a sure-win for guests!

The pork and lentil combination worked nicely however I found the celery root puree took much longer than the recipe suggested which meant the other two dishes had to be kept warm. I served it with a wonderful new discovery, Cousino-Macul's 2000 reserve Cabernet. At $14 a bottle, the price couldn't be beat and the hint of spice perfectly complimented the pork.

The celery root puree was excellent. I made the lentils without bacon and they were fine. The sauce for the pork was very hot. It may have been the cayenne that I used. The other mild elements complemented the 'heat'.

This was easy (I made the lentils in advance)and absolutely delicious.
