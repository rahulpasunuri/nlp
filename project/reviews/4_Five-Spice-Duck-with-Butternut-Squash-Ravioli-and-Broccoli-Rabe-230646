This is a simple and tasty recipe that is a real winner. The smokey flavor of the bacon nicely complimented the duck. The suggestion about the plum jam and red wine was excellent. I served this with mushroom ravioli. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I had a kabocha squash, but didn't want to make ravioli. Instead I made a squash risotto. I also braised kale with bacon, onions and mushrooms. The duck flavor was outstanding! ( I also had farmer's market ducks). Instead of plum wine I had a homemade plum chutney which I warmed up in the microwave - it was a perfect sauce. The 3 dishes were fantastic together. I think I have my Christmas dinner....

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I couldn't find plum wine so I boiled down some white wine with some plum jam in it. I tried the wanton wrappers and it was a mess. They all stuck together and had a funny texture. I would just buy the ravioli or if you are really ambitious, make real ones.

This dish is wonderful. Given the oven time, it is a perfect dish to make for a dinner party. I used duck legs (thigh/leg). I've made this twice. I DO NOT recommend boiling down the plum wine. It is watery and a waste of wine. I was very dissatisfied with the result. The first time I made this, I had plum sauce to which I added red wine and boiled. So much better flavor and consistency. I think that plum or apricot jam with wine would work as well.

Just use wonton wrappers for the ravioli and go to town! :)

Very good. The spice rub is excellent and it could be used on chicken, too.

This was really good. I admit that I also bought the ravioli as I didn't have time to make it from scratch. (I also don't have a pasta maker.) I did buy my duck from an Asian store here in town. I used the leftover duck to render fat for Duck Confit, also on this site. And that recipe turned out excellent! I would suspect that you could also use it on duck breasts and/or legs that you could purchase from a butcher or a high-end grocery store.

Absolutely incredible flavors. My guests loved the duck. I didn't have time to cook the side dishes so I simply purchased some striped sun dried tomato ravioli and 2 pounds of yellow squash. For the Ravioli I drizzled pesto sauce on it. To bring in some of the duck flavors to the squash I took about 1/4 cup of the drippings from the pan and browned 1 minced shallot and 1/2 a medium red onion (finely chopped. I pureed this mixture and indented a small dollop of it on the pureed yellow squash. Delicious duck recipe, will be one of our favorites for years to come!

I had this at Ovio and it was amazing!

Yes, using purchased ravioli does make this dish easier, but so does stopping by a restaurant and asking for dinner to go. Take the time, make the gnocchi. Maybe, if you are a very skilled chef, you could even cut up your own duck!
