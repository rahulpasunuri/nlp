Tasted too much of mustard and vinegar for us. I ended up blending in some plain yogurt and mayo to lessen the effect. The peas were a nice touch though.

Made this for a potluck. Got many great comments. I am going to try it with shrimp rather than ham. I liked the idea of adding cilantro (from previous reviewer). I love the bright, fresh look and flavor.

Excellent and very, very pretty. I used black forest ham and was initially a little concerned, but if the ham is cut small, the smokey outside actually enhances the visuals.

Usually make macaroni salad the same as potato salad. Decided to try this just to be different. Good move! Just the satisfaction of taking a more healty approach was great incentive. Followed the recipe closely with the following exceptions. Didn't have large macaroni; used small. Would do so again, as more surface with which to absorb flavors. Also added just a "tad" of fresh cilantro out of the garden. Interesting twist! Also a pinch (plus) of dried pepper flakes; nice zing! Our guests broke out in a big grin when we offered to send some of the leftovers home with them (along with the recipe).

i've made this several times for bbq's & it's always been very popular. easy to make & much lighter than the traditional mac salad.

I didn't find this to be anything special and I won't make it again as I have another (not from this site) that I like better. I'm not a fan of celery so if I were to make it again, I might substitute watercress. I did as well find it a little oily so would suggest reducing the olive oil. Don't spare the salt!

Fresh is the word that best describes this salad. Light, delicious, and easy to make. Plus, it held well for several days,

Following other's advice, I used a little more mustard, lemon juice and vinegar with the same amount of olive oil. I also added some chopped celery leaves for added color and flavor. This is not only beautiful, but a nice, light version that is different from the mayo based recipes. Definitely a keeper.

This is good, but it does require a fair amount of salt--I wonder if some of the reviewers who found it bland skimped on this important ingredient! I added about 3 T kosher salt to the macaroni water and also added about a tsp. to the dressing, as well as 1/2 to 1 tsp sugar to make it more tangy.

This was wonderful! The girls in the office raved about the light refreshing taste. very easy to make. I did substitute red wine vinegar instead of the white but could not tell a difference.

I made this for my daughter who loves pasta salad and it was a real winner. The dressing was great.

Very good. Previous cook should have had more faith and used the dressing. I took it to a potluck picnic and everyone loved it.

This dressing was the worst I have ever tasted. I was lucky that I had my husband taste it before adding to the salad or else I would have to throw it away.

Absolutely fabulous. My mother-in-law was eating it out of my refrigerator from the tupperware container. Husband had thirds!!!
