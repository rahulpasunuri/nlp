I served the sauce with crab legs and it was to die for. It would be awesome with jumbo shrimp.

Made this as it was written...wonderful. The crab we had was very sweet or I may have tried honey mustard, but glad I didn't. Will make this instead of the cocktail sauce for other seafood.

This is better sauce for crab claws than crab legs! I used a wholegrain mustard to tone it down a bit which worked nicely

Made this for an annual crab feed in Seattle. Everyone loved it. You can vary the heat by reducing the horseradish or increasing the mayo. Delicious.

Very tasty. After reading the ingredients I was concerned that the sauce woud overpower the crab but it definately did not.

Just made this delicious sauce tonight with Alaskan King Crab legs. My guest RAVED about this and said Legal Seafoods better watch out! This is definately a dipping sauce I'll make again.

Did not have dijon mustard, but had honey mustard which cut the sharpness and gave it a sweeter taste overall. I later made it with dijon but prefer the honey mustard. I find the latter complements the salty, sea flavor of the crab legs.

A delicious alternative to the standard tomato based cocktail sauce to serve with shrimp! Not very complicated in taste or preparation, but a great basic dipping sauce with all sorts of stuff, like beef skewers, pigs-in-a-blanket, and even raw vegetables. Crab legs I think might be too "regal" for such a brash accompaniment.

I'd lost this recipe and am so relieved to find it on-line. The reviewer who said this would be good for fondue is right on the money. We have beef fondue every Christmas Eve and this is everyone's favorite dipping sauce! Try it with beef, folks. Try it with beef!

I love Crab Legs,so this was good with them!

I agree with the other cook below, this sauce is too overpowering for such an expensive seafood. You want something that brings out the sweetness of the crab, not something that covers it up - after spending all that money? We ended up melting butter at the last minute and drizzling the legs with lemon, so the purchase was not all for nought. When it comes to king crab, stick to the classics!

The mustard sauce would be good with something else, maybe a dip for a fondue dinner. But with the crab I found it to be a bit overpowering.

This dip was out of this world! I made an assortment of cold seafoods to dip (Crab legs, prawns, scallops....) and it was delectable. I can imagine it with fried fishes instead of boring tartar sauce. I wouldn't change a thing!

A really tasty simple sauce that can be quickly made from ingredients on hand. Enjoyed it with king crab legs and will try it with other shellfish. Also, used lite mayo and it set up nicely and was not runny.

A GREAT EASY TASTY SAUCE FOR THE CRAB LEGS - WHICH I WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN - TOO BAD KING CRAB LEGS ARE SO EXPENSIVE

To Park City reader: the restaurant's name is in fact mentioned-- if you look again, you'll see that it's Canlis, in Seattle, Washington

I've made this dish three times and all three times it was a hit with my guests. Tip: In a hurry? Cheat and use Dijon mustard with REAL mayo and add a little habanero sauce for kick.

Wouldn't change a thing! The dipping sauce is great as it is. Tried it with lower fat mayo and it is too runny and doesn't have the same flavor or body. I dont think we are meant to cut the fat out of all things. I sacraficed and ate a smaller dessert rather than skimp on this. Crab legs are an indulgence--enjoy!!

A lower fat, lower sodium version, healthier for us all, would be to substitute fat free Mayo and check the nutrition labels on the back of the Dijon mustard containers. There is an amazing range of sodium in prepared mustard. Prepared horseradish, too. Wish the restaurant's name had been mentioned.
