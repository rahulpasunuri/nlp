This was GREAT. Will definitely add to the dinner rotation, and can't wait to pass the recipe along to my family. I had to cook the chicken for 20min; it got nice and browned and was incredibly moist. My husband thought the artichokes were a little mushy (did eat a bunch, though, even though he 'doesn't like them'); could potentially add later if you're ambitious but I'm just going to keep cooking it as written. Can't wait to have it again!

Can't believe I forgot the parmesan...it was still delicious. I definitely had to broil for closer to 20 minutes. Served with Perfect Rice, also on Epicurious.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because of the simplicy and time. Perfect for a hard day after work or an elegant presentation for guests. i add a ton of crushed garlic and finish it before serving with fresh lemon juice. Extra cheese is always a plus. I find it takes 20 minutes to cook.

I love this quick recipe coming home late from work and starving. OR, when I have dinner guests and want to look like a genius. Chicken thighs are a must and all that nice fat keeps it juicy. I also add a ton of crushed garlic and fresh lemon juice. I use a bit of the oil out of the artichokes as well. Throw all in a bowl and stir. Dump it all into the broiler with no overlap in a layer. Just enough time to toss a salad and pour a glass of wine, By then it is time to turn them over and pick out a movie. Perfect on the plate. Go ahead; get freaky with the parmsean finish and a touch more lemon juice. :)

Not sure why this got such high marks. I baked rather than broiled.It tasted okay, but, frankly, didn't look all that appetizing. Too much of the same color. May try one more time broiling before I delete this from my recipe box.

Talk about quick and easy... Wow. Made just as the receipe stated and it was awesome. My husband didnt really like artichokes but after this he is a fan. I will try with breast next time for an even healthier meal. I am def. making this again!

This was so simple and really, really good. I served it with cous cous and it is a definite keeper!

I love this recipe. I think it is delectable and elegant (and I much prefer eating out at the nicest restaurant I can find to cooking). It is also very difficult to botch it as chicken thighs do not easily dry out. Disagree with others who felt that it was not special: how often do you serve an entree with artichokes? To me that gives it a cool twist. I throw cherry tomatoes on at the end and for me they add a nice touch.

Tasty recipe. More parmesan never hurt anything, though. I had to broil the chicken for closer to 20 minutes.

For a 20 minute meal this was great. It was so easy and tasty. I read the recipe incorrectly though and ended up not draining the artichokes. While I preheated the oven I marinated the chicken in the artichokes along with some garlic. I threw it all on the broiler and when it was finished served the chicken juices on the side. This is a nice dish to go to when you have unexpected dinner guests.

This recipe is so great and simple. I have tried leaving the thighs to marinate in the bowl with the artichokes and other ingredients for a while before broiling, and that makes it all the more tasty. This recipe does also work with breasts, although I think the thighs are best.

Rating: 3
This one's all about THIGHS, guys, and about a quick meal under the broiler. (Shillenbrand from Northridge's unmemorable result using breasts does not surprise me.) The recipe as given produces moist, tender, flavorful, perfectly cooked chicken. Be sure not to pile one piece of chicken on top of another or to put too many artichokes directly on the chicken, or the meat won't cook evenly.

If I didn't feel so incredibly full after eating too much of this recipe, I probably would have rated it a 4 because it was so easy to make and very good.

One of our favorite, quick, tasty, and, close to, elegant meals. Make it as it's written for guests or for a weeknight. Tonight it serves as the birthday dinner for my teenager. His request, served with Perfect Rice, also on this site.

Not bad, considering the small amount of work this recipe requires. But nothing terribly exciting either.

Incredibly easy recipe - great for a week night. Served it over buttered egg noodles, but will also try others' suggestions for serving with couscous or potatoes. Added a clove of garlic, which was a nice touch.

another 3.5 forks here. i made this with chicken breasts instead of thighs and followed another cook's suggestion to serve with cous cous. quick, easy, and satisfying.

3 1/2 forks. Thanks for the recommendations/modifications. Used nice thighs from Trader Joe's (artichokes from there too). Tossed with 2 minced garlic cloves. Baked at 450 for 30 min and 375 for last 15 min. Deglazed pan with chiken broth and poured juices over. Will become an often-used recipe for my family. Even my 8 year-old twins liked it.

Tried this for dinner last night and thought it was really simple and flavorful. The browning that you get from broiling the chicken and artichokes gives a great taste to the dish. I only made two small additions: added some garlic powder and fennel seeds when mixing the chicken and atrichokes with oil, salt and pepper. Great for a busy week night!

Don't be scared by the simplicity of this recipe, I made it as is and everyone (two teens and husband) raved. Served with Perfect Rice a big green salad and crusty bread for a rustic meal to share with friends. I would like to give 3.5 forks just because it was so easy.

Suggest rinsing the artichokes if they are marinated. The marinade overpowers the chicken. Also, broil the thighs for 7 min, not 5. Best part of this recipe: FAST! Serve with a flavorful couscous, like the NearEast brand.

Rating: 2
P.S. In the last 10 mins. I also poured in about 1/4 cup chicken stock to make a little "sauce" as it was very dry.

This recipe definitely needs "tricks" to make it "memorable"! I used breasts cut to thigh-size and tossed the chicken and artichokes in garlic olive oil (home-made, and a MUST for the pantry!), and baked at 400/375 as suggested by another reviewer. In the last 10 minutes I tossed in a couple of seeded/chopped tomatoes. When done I sprinkled with crumbs from crushed (home-made) garlic croutons and the shaved parmesan and served with buttered egg noodles. After these additions the dish had some memorabilty, but otherwise it would be very ordinary. My husband doesn't care much for artichokes but enjoyed this, I wasn't too impressed - seemed like a "pot-luck" dish. However I must say it made for tasty leftovers for lunch the next day. Perhaps letting the flavors meld overnight is the way to go. Won't rush to make it again, but a keeper for a quick throw-together and a 2nd meal.

Great, simple dish. I added a small can of peas at the end for color, flavor, and texture enhancement. Great dish.

Okay, the recipe seemed like it would be a little dull as written, so of course I tweaked it. A lot. First, I added a lot of chopped garlic and lemon zest to the olive oil to let the chicken marinate (I don't know of many dishes that aren't improved with garlic!) I took some of the ideas from other reviewers....baking it in a 400 oven and turning it down to 375. I used artichoke bottoms instead of the hearts and I added sun dried tomatoes, fresh thyme, white wine and bread crumbs at the end (another great suggestion from a reviewer.) Served it over buttered noodles. It truly was an amazing and very easy dish to make. But it is very different than the original recipe, so I am sure some people will take umbrage with my improvisation. But MY version is a definite 4 fork meal!

This wasn't bad. Very easy to make. I can't imagine why anyone would add another tbsp of oil at the end, though. Jeez!

Really terrific, easy, fast and everyone tore it up. Definitely in the rotation. Amazing what just a few ingredients can do.

Considering how quick and easy this recipe is, I very nearly gave it 4 forks. This was delicious and so simple to prepare. I didn't change a thing except that I used a 13 X 9 pan to broil the chicken. Came out perfect -- I agree that the last tbsp of olive oil may be unnecessary. Light, fresh, and a nice tangy flavor from the artichoke hearts (adding more wouldn't hurt).

This was delicious. I did make a few minimal changes. Instead of broiling I baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for half an hour than 375 for about 15 more minutes. I also cut up two small vidalia onions and added it to the mix. I did add a tiny bit of seasoned bread crumbs and some garlic olive oil during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. The onions were fantastic with it. I was so pleased with this dish, I will defintely make it again, and try the chicken broth idea some others had posted to make it even more healthy.

Rating: 4
Great dish. Delicious and very easy. The only changes I made were to cook everything in an oven-safe pan at ~450F for 30min and to add a little chicken stock to deglaze the pan at the end, as suggested by another reviewer. Super easy!

Rating: 4
Incredibly easy and delicious! I didn't have a rack so I just broiled it in a large casserole dish; took longer but kept more of the juice than I expect broiling would have. I didn't have to add the extra tbsp of oil at the end, anyway.

I love this recipe. The artichokes crisp up in the broiler and the chicken blends really well with the tang of the artichokes. It's so quick and easy too. I would definitely recommend.

Rating: 4
This was very tasty and different. The marinated artichoke hearts were a bit tangy and made a change from the usual chicken recipe. I used boneless breasts, browned them in a pan with a little garlic, then dumped in the drained artichokes. Covered and simmered 12 minutes. Then poured in a Tbs cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup chicken broth to thicken and glaze all. Shaved a little parmesan on top but forgot the parsley! Still tasted great. Served with buttered noodles and broccoli. Very tasty.

These were surprisingly good for such a simple recipe! Definitely a bistro-style recipe. I did make some changes based on the reviews. I added three cloves of minced garlic. I also roasted them in the oven at 500 degrees for 30 minutes. They came out perfectly  the skin was beautifully crisp and the meat was moist. Absolutely delicious. I also didnt bother to add any more oil to the drippings, but just poured it directly on the chicken in the serving dish. The only change Id make next time would be to slightly cut back on the salt. I served them with jasmine rice and buttered zucchini, but I think theyd be even better with mashed potatoes.

Easy, quick, yummy dinner. It did take longer to cook than listed. The parsley is key.

This was quite good. I used bone-in chicken thighs with skin, since boneless, skinless chicken pieces seem to dry out for me when I cook them. I tossed all together as directed, but roasted in a black iron skillet at 500 degrees for 25 minutes instead of broiling. When done, I deglazed the pan with some chicken broth instead of adding more oil. The result was a lovely, crisp chicken with a juicy interior (calorie watchers can discard the skin). Poured a bit of the pan juices over the chicken and the rice and topped with the cheese and parsley as directed. It really tasted like a far more complex dish than it is--very good and easy.

This was delicious but I found that the chicken had to cook almost twice as long a the recipe suggest....could be my oven, but good to know if you are trying to coordinate with other dishes.
