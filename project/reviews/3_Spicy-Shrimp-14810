This was average and I like spicy foods. Definitely shorten the cooking time to 5 or 6 minutes depending on the size of the shrimp. (When they are baked the water they retain will evaporate and they shrink.) Don't marinate for more than 1 hour. Half the Tabasco, add 1 T. of Worchestershire.

Even at just 8 or 9 minutes in the oven, dry and unappetizing. Yuck! I definitely wouldn't make this dish again.

I cooked the shrimp only 7 minutes and they were still dry (and tough). Perhaps marinating in the lemon juice for 4 hours was too much. Or maybe the recipe requires jumbo prawns - I used the 31 to 40 per lb. size .... The flavor was good, though. Next time I will saute for 3 minutes, like I do when preparing shrimp for a pasta dish.

The seasoning is wonderful. The preparation time is 10 minutes and it's perfect to make as an appetizer or an entree. The only problem is that at 425 the shrimp dry out if you cook them for the time specified. I would try it for 8 to 10 minutes instead.

This is the best shrimp recipe I have ever made. I increased the cumin and did them on the grill. I'll definately make these for our next party.

Easy to make just like I like it!!!.......about the review below, snow peas?.....bother?.....if this recipe was a bother you must literally hate cooking but I assume you're critique is for a different recipe.

Wrapping the snow peas just did not work, so I served the shrimp by itself. OK, but not worth the bother of preparing this dish again.
