this was great and so easy to make. it took no time at all to make the sauce. Its got great flavor and very spicy especially if you do in fact use the chili sauce. I used 2 different thai chili sauces that I had on hand--a garlic chili sauce and a sweet chilli sauce (I didn't have enough of one so I combined them). it was really good. if you like spicy this is a good one! we'll be using this again and again.

Didn't like the sauce very much and had trouble getting the chicken cooked all the way through. Had it on for about 40 minutes and the middle was still undercooked.

Wonderful and easy recipe! I also had no chili sauce so I substituted ketchup and 1/4 tsp ground red pepper. I also added 1 extra TBSP. of cider vinegar and substituted the orange juice for 3 TBSP frozen orange juice concentrate. I had enough leftover sauce to store and it stored in my fridge for 2 weeks until I used up the rest of it on pork tenderloin medallions. Absolutely delicious!

Was looking for a new way to do chicken and found this recipe which looked easy enough-and I had all but one of the ingredients on hand, so I tried it. I substituted an equal amount of ketchup for the chili sauce, but it worked. We loved it, even my two finicky kiddos. We've made it twice in one week. Make extra to have cold the next day. Yum!

These were delicious and easy! I didn't have molasses, so I used honey and brown sugar, and it tasted great! The orange added such a fantastic flavor! I will definitely be making this again.

Great sauce!! But I changed it a little bit, I added 1/2 cup of chili sauce instead one, I added 1/2cup of Honey Hickory sauce, and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce instead of molasses (not a big fan of molasses). The sauce had such a amazing taste, spiceness to it.....try it, but the recpie is excellent! Uma

I did enjoy the sauce grilled onto the chicken -- it was delicious. However, I thought it was too spicy just off the stove served on the side. (so much chili powder, it made me gag a little). Therefore, next time I made this I will make only half the amount to only use for grilling.

The sauce was really good. My husband usually prefers bottled sauce, but he really liked this. The orange peel and the chili sauce make this one special. I'm going to try this on ribs next.
