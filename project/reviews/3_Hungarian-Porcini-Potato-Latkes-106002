I grew up on Hungarian cooking. My mother never made this one. One question, what do onions have to do with this recipie? Are the reviewers refering to the "Foghagdma" which is garlic? I just don't get some people - no wonder the recipie didn't come out right! I would think that the onions would only make it taste MUCH BETTER wouldn't it?

terrible! I have made rosti before which is half the work of this recipe and tastes 10X better. If you are going to make this dish- do not add water like the recipe says- I'm confused as to why you would- it washes away alot of the starch needed to bond the potato together and reduces the flavour because the paprika gets washed out in the water. No matter how hard you try to drain the water from the potato you just can't get it all. Save yourself the dissapointment!

This was my first attempt at latkes, and while they weren't as good as my mom's, everyone enjoyed them! The mushroom flavor was wonderful and well complemented by the paprika. My latkes came out a little mushy, thouh - does anyone have advice for next time?

I've made this recipe several times following it completely... it is excellent.

I don't understand where the "bright people" were getting the onions from. Maybe that's why the had a terrible exprience with this recipe.

I added 50% more mushrooms and half a medium sweet onion (grated)... yum, yum! serve with low fat sour cream and apple or apricot sauce.

This is very good. I used more porcinis than called for, because, well, I love the earthy flavor they give. I'm not quite sure what the previous reviewer means by "onion" -- there are no onions in this recipe. The garlic enhances the flavor of the mushrooms and paprika. I will definitely make this again.

You cannot taste any porcini flavor in this recipe. The onion flavor overwhelms the latke. The latkes were a lot of work and reminded me of hash browns you can buy at McDonalds.
