Delicious and relatively straight forward. Didn't need as much garlic as specified. With this sauce, we needed to make sure that we didn't overcrowd the pot - the mussels wouldn't open otherwise - and the heat didn't seem to distribute evenly (it might have just been our pan).

the sauce was spicy with only 1 tsp of chile peppers and does not need any salt as the mussels are harvested from salty ocean water.reduce the leftover sauce,add some cream and serve over pasta with grilled shrimp.

Instead of bread, I served this over pasta. Amazing! Can't wait to make it again.

the hardest part of this was purchasing the mussels (this was my first experience with this ingredient). So simple and fast, yet delicious & elegant. I thought the red pepper and amount of fresh basil & oregano would be overwhelming, but the flavors were tremendous. I added a cup or so of tomato puree to the leftover sauce & then froze it - I think it will be very good as a pasta sauce.

Amazingly good. Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Turned my husband into a mussel eater. So simple to make. Also served it with linguine.

Perhaps I made it wrong...but I definitely felt it was heavily herbed and lack depth. I have made other mussel dishes that I much prefer over this one.

Outstanding, especially when you consider the simplicity of the recipe. And I did not have the chives, basil or oregano handy, but it was delicious none the less.

VERY good sauce. Saved it to go with pasta just like the other reviewers. Would be good really good with shrimp instead of mussels. Will definitly make again!

This is so simple to make and sooo....good. I upped the garlic and white wine a bit but received rave reviews. I'm looking forward to pairing the leftover sauce w/half and half to make a soup.

Terrific recipe on the first run-through. Next time (which the family says should be tomorrow) I will try more herbs, half the salt and red pepper, and a pinch of sugar. There's lots of leftover sauce, which was terrific over pasta.

This recipe is fantastic. I didn't have scallions or fresh chive so I sauteed some chopped shallots with the garlic and added some dried chives. I also added some fresh chopped Italian parsley with the freash basil and parsley. It was delicious. The mussels were great but my fav is the garlic rubbed bread dipped in the sauce its amazing!

This is wonderful. I had left over sauce so I added a small amount of half and half and fresh basil. I pureed this and had as a cup of soup. Wonderful again!

I made this for Valentine's Day. It was excellent! I only had 10 cloves of garlic and that seems to be sufficient.

Excellent. Would make again. Use 1 teaspoon of red pepper. Results in plenty of heat.

we loved this simple recipe. I only used half the red pepper flakes and added capers. terrific!!

I thought the garlic was going to overpower the dish, but it was heavenly! I only used basil of the list of herbs, and we bought some La Brea Bakery grain bread, which was great. Will definitely be making this dish again!
