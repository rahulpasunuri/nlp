This was a simple dish to make and a great way to use up leftover Guava nector. The sauce, a nice peachy color, was pleasant sweet and tangy. I believe the key is to boil down the sauce until it is very thick and sticky.

This wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't anything I want to eat again. It was too sweet, and bland.

I substituted the guava nectar with one can of guava shells in heavy syrup, YUMMY!

hmmm...i'm surprised at the lack of good comments on this dish. i have been making this recipe for about 2 years now & it is on regular rotation at our house. just the right combination of sweet & salty. i serve it with black beans & green beans as suggested--yummy!

It was OK but a bit sweet and missing something to make it special. All voted at the table to not have it for dinner again.

A nice chicken dish, although not fantastic.

It's Chicken with GUAVA sauce... Where's the GUAVA? Shouldn't it be SOMEWHERE in the recipe? While it is yummy, it was frustrating because I was looking for something to do with all the guavas from my tree. REAL guavas, I mean.
