Wow, amazing! Other than the time it takes to roast the veggies, this couldn't have been easier or quicker to make! I made it to accompany the turkey meatloaf recipe. Will definitely be making again to try on other things.

This was so easy and delicious. I am on a special diet that I can't eat salt, or oil. This gave the sauce so much delicious flavor! Adding some basil at the end

I can't stand ketchup, so this recipe gives you a great alternative with the red pepper sauce. I skip the ketchup all together except in the mix. Works out fine. The cremini, or baby portobellos, are key. The mest meatloaf recipe I've ever tried!

Outstanding for flavor and versitility! I even have my shortcut method when pressed for time: jarred roasted peppers, Muir Glen organic whole tomatoes sauted garlic, balsamic cream, lemon, and the best olive oil in my pantry. You'll never miss ketchup again!

Made this sauce with the meatloaf and really liked it. As a bonus, everything smells great when you're preparing it. I did make a couple minor modifications, using a couple of onhand vine tomatoes instead of Plum/Roma and using less balsamic. I look forward to trying the sauce with some other dishes, as suggested by other reviewers.

A good base, but I found this sauce to be a touch sharp tasting. I found I needed to add some light miso to round it out (which might sound odd, but it gives a nice body and fuller flavour). I also added some black pepper and fresh rosemary. Certainly worth making and then adjusting as you see fit (which could be not at all!)

I made this with the turkey meatloaf a while ago. I remember the meatloaf being a big flavorless disappointment but the sauce was delish. I am making the sauce tonight to top another recipe. I used regular tomatoes and otherwise followed the recipe.

Wonderful. Followed recipe exactly, unfortunately. I say "unfortunately" because these ingredients don't need to stay in the oven NEARLY as long as indicated. Had I not peeked in to check on them at about 35 minutes, I'd have had to start over, so... Careful! Otherwise, soooo good. Freezes well, too.

I fixed this a couple of weeks ago and can't get it out of my mind. It was so delish. I can't even remember what I served with it. The kids loved it also, on bow tie pasta with fresh grated parmasan.

This is an easy and versatile dish. I used the roasted vegetables and mixed it in with a little bit of chicken stock and added spicy italian sausage with penne. It was very good and easy. I also plan to use it to make a cream of roasted tomato and red pepper soup.

This is a great sauce to keep on hand and use instead of sugar laden catsup. It is great with the meatloaf but would be very good with grilled chicken, fish, on sandwiches, etc.

Is it just me, or was anyone else tempted to forget the sauce and just eat the roasted tomatoes and red pepper? I was slightly disappointed with the sauce after having tasted how amazing the veggies came out on their own -- the raw product was better. Then again, I foolishly added 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar as the recipe said, instead of "to taste." Just a personal preference, but I thought it was a bit much. Others loved the sauce though, and I'm sure I'll make it again.

I found this sauce to be bland. I thought it would add a nice kick as an accompaniment to the turkey meat loaf, but I think it tasted fine without it. The sauce didn't seem to add anything new the the meat loaf.

More dumbing-down by our friends at Gourmet magazine. This is a coulis. I don't think using the proper terminology will turn anybody away, do you?

This sauce is excellent. Goes great with the meatloaf!! I was worried that my tomatoes got burned on the bottom during roasting but when they were blended it was fine. Couldn't find plum tomatoes. Used cherry instead and it was great.

This sauce is *AMAZING*!! The turkey meatloaf didn't really need the sauce (it was great on it's own), so I had lots leftover -- served it over Parmesean Chicken from this site, slathered it on turkey sandwiches, even dipped breadsticks in it! I will definitely make this again and again!

The meat loaf was very tasty, a little dry though. Would cook it in less time. The red pepper sauce was fantastic and would make it again. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. Takes some time to make.

Very tasty, I added fresh thyme to the sauce

It WAS delicious with everything else after the meatloaf was gone. A definite keeper.

Delicious with the turkey meatloaf, and probably anything else too!
