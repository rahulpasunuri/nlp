I agree......I've been making this salsa for years with the Black Bean Coriander Cakes. Outstanding!!!!

Perfect with the Black Bean Coriander cakes. Any excess gets used up quickly in my house.

A great dip, and everything in it is good for you.

I have not actually tried this salsa yet.

Boring. No zip, no zest, all together unimpressive.

I am sorry, but this is aweful. I definately would not make this again. It is too dry and pretty bland. It needs to be kicked up a notch!
