Very satisfying, tasty recipe for short ribs that's very easy to put together. I might suggest 1/2 teaspoon black pepper instead full teaspoon, but other than that the recipe stands up very well as is. I substituted beef broth for chicken, seemed to make more sense. Very good on rice or mashed potatoes. Awesome!

Slow cooker modification: Brown ribs. Place in slow cooker. Coat with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, coriander - plus 1/2 tsp chipotle pepper, 1 T smoked paprika and 7 ounces of chicken broth. Cook on low for 6 hours. Refrigerate. Skim fat. Reheat (tented in foil) in 350 oven for 40 minutes. Remove meat from bone and soak in pan juices. Fill ramekins 1/2 way with noodles or rice and top with savory meat and any remaining pan juices.

Delicious and easy. It could use a bit less cumin. I didn't have coriander. And I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used tomatoe sauce. I did not add Anaheim chilies.

I used the boneless short ribs from Costco and took a little bit more effort to use diced fresh plum tomatoes,this dish dish came out amazing. It is a crowd pleaser and it tastes even better the next day. I served it with garlic roasted Yukon gold mashed potatoes. The whole thing was extra special. We enjoyed the whole dinner.

This is a great recipe that I have made over and over. Instead of the short ribs I substitute 2 lbs or so of stew meat. Otherwise, I follow the recipe and it's always a pleaser. Very good over smashed red potatoes.

Really, really good! Husband and 13 year old daughter loved it. I used frozen Hatch green chilies that I had on hand from this summer instead of the one's specified. I diced them and put into the pot along with the other ingredients, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Like another reviewer, I'd like to try this with a different meat, possibly pork shoulder? The sauce that this recipe makes is extremely flavorful, slightly spicy but not so much so that my daughter wouldn't eat it.

Oh my goodness. So easy and EXCEPTIONAL. I didn't include the green chilis, and I think I used more like 2 to 2.5 tablespoons of the chopped chipotle chilis. Served with tortillas, but would be great on its own.

Delicious sauce. I did not use the green peppers and I pureed the tomato/onion sauce. This would be a great sauce for a brisket also.

Very good - they have quite a kick and are so moist and tender. It makes a lot of very thin sauce that maybe could have been reduced. I don't think the pepper rings as garnish are necessary.

This was easy and DELICIOUS! At the suggestion of another reviewer, I added the chopped Anaheim Chilis earlier, about an hour into the oven time. Didn't have canned Chipotle's, so used Amazon Chipotle Sauce from the bottle. Served with a big round of corn bread, and an orange fennel watercress salad. Great Success! Will def make it again...

This was wonderful! I trimmed the excess fat from the ribs before browning and the dish was not at all greasy. Hard to go wrong with chipotle and lime. Served it with the Golden Corn and Saffron Polenta from this site - too yummy.

Rating: 4
Excellent + easy! I tripled the recipe and didn't follow the ingredient quantities exactly, but did use every ingredient. For instance, I dumped the entire can of tomatoes into the dish and was very approximate in measuring the onion and garlic. I also increased the amount of chipotles in adobo after tasting the finished product and realizing I wanted it to be a bit spicier. The result was a big success.

I made this into tacos. I shredded the meat into the sauce, added a can of black beans and cooked it in this manner during the last 25 minutes. I served it with good quality soft corn tortillas, and made a roasted tomato salsa with onion, cilantro and jalopeno, guacamole and sauteed onions with chipotle peppers and lime. Awesome!

This is a GREAT recipe! Especially good served over mashed (skin on) red potatoes. I've made this over and over again...always with raves.

Awesommmmmeeee. I adhered to the recipe (for the most part - used regular grass-fed beef ribs instead of short ribs, eliminating the need to cool & drain the fat), and the only thing I'd really do differently next time is adding the Anaheim chilies at the same time as the tomatoes instead of at the end. Mr. H was in heaven!

Rating: 4
Took the advice from another review and pureed the tomatoes and chipotle chilies. Cooked at 325 for 2 hours and 20 min at 400 then transfered ribs to a platter, used a fat separator with a strainer and poured the good stuff over the ribs with the leftovers in the strainer. Everbody loved it!

Rating: 3
This was a very good dish. I used chuck roast cut into large chunks rather than beef ribs since the chuck was half the price. I added a can of mexican hominey, drained and rinsed, after I added the tomatoes, which was a great addition. Will try it using pork shoulder or perhaps pork chops in the future. Would also most likely work well with dark meat chicken pieces. It was a bit too hot for my kids, so I will also likely cut back on the chipotle.

Rating: 4
I've made it several times now and have inevitably taken a freer hand. While always slightly different, it is a resilient recipe that consistently yields great results. Typically, I double the recipe or so as the leftovers might even be better. One twist I've added is a bottle of a slightly sweet ale such as Chimay (MacKeson is best if you can still find it) to counterpoint the Adobo sauce. However, I once stupidly used a bitter chocolate ale and had to throw the whole thing out.

The flavor wasn't the wow I thought it would be, though I substituted fire-roasted red bell peppers for the Anaheims. I'm betting that the leftovers will be better tomorrow. Served over carmelized shallot mashed potatoes. Good, but not great.

I thought this recipe was terrific, very flavorful and different. I don't know why this couldn't be made with a chuck roast instead of the ribs, which were somewhat time-consuming to trim, then de-bone and trim again. As far as the fattiness of the dish, I was able to put the pot into the snow so it cooled off quickly. It was a snap to then collect the fat and dispose of it. I will definitely make this again, and maybe serve it in a tortilla wrap.

This was a good dish overall, but myself personally and the Poker Guys agree the Chipotle and green chili sauce was not the best or a close third, but it was not a least favorite either.

I am sure krosswaugh from Toronto cooks wonderful Mexican food. The title of this recipe does not say Mexican and there are so many good ratings for this dish that it has to have something good going for it. I found it a few years ago and have made it several times. It is a family favorite. I use about half the chipotle as the brand I get is quite spicy. When the ribs are done I take them out and pour the sauce into a strainer over a fat separator. I then pour all the broth back into the pot along with what stays in the strainer, leaving the fat behind. A fat separator is a great kitchen tool for recipes like this. I then add the green chillies and cook a short time so they still have some crunch. I think the lime gives it a nice bright flavor. Lime is common in a lot of Caribbean recipes in combination with peppers.

Rating: 4
Funnily enough I made up a similar flavor combination, but with regular chiles such as jalapeno/Serrano combo instead of the chipotle. Chipotle is pretty overwhelming, and I think over-used. (Think McDonalds has a chipotle sauce=gross) Other chilies work better with the lime/tomato flavor. Trim your ribs before hand, and cool them after you've cooked to desired tenderness. It is much easier to scrape off the fat after they've sat in the fridge overnight, but this is just a rich meal regardless. Short-ribs are an extremely fatty cut of meat. I actually add about 1 cup of water mid-cooking as well, because I love a lot of juicy, flavorful broth. YUM! This also freezes well, I've kept it for up to 6 months!

I've lived in Mexico, been a successful Mexican chef, taught Mexican cuisine, been a Mexican food consultant for over 50 years. I would never use 'chili powder' or ahahein peppers together in a dish with chilpotle, nor olive oil-use vegetable oil,nor black pepper. When you are using chile chilpotle you have the proper flavour. You should never put two chiles together that don't marry well. Chili Powder should not be used especially when you are using such a wonderful chile-which means in Nahua-"smoked chile." And why on earth would you need black pepper? That's a European idea. Be careful of the amount of chilpotle- 1 1/2 tablespoons is a bit excessive in relation to the amount of tomatoes. And the tomatoes should be pureed. What's the lime juice for?

Can I give this 2.5 stars? My main problem with this is that I thought the whole thing was terribly greasy. I refrigerated over night, and there was easily a half inch of fat on top. Maybe my ribs were not "well-trimmed" (having read the "market tip" after purchasing) but I would consider doing this dish again only if I used my usual stew meat, or a roast or something, with less fat. As for the sauce, it was alright, but not out of this world. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made this with the Baked Cheese Grits recipe from Gourmet on this site, and they were really good (3 forks), but this one left me sort of cold. I expected it to be *great*, but it was just okay.

Fantastic flavors! I would suggest making a bit more sauce, but we used more ribs as well. Kicked it up a bit more with more adobo as well. I don't know if it was just our ribs, but I would also suggest lower cooking temp along with more cooking time. Mashed potatoes perfect to sop up the wonderful sauce. Make this recipe!

I cooked my ribs in 325 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours and then reuced heat to 300 for another hour. I served a lime crema on top of the beef short ribs. The lime sour cream mixture added a silkiness to the dish and worked well with the spicy ribs, I served the dish with carmelized shallot mashed potatoes and it was wonderful.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic! I served them over grits, with an orange, red onion and avocado salad. Next time, I think I'd use boneless ribs and possibly chill after the braise, overnight, so that I could get ALL the fat out before proceeding. Either that or I need to acquire a reliable fat separator gizmo.

I was a bit dubious about this recipe, my husband doesn't like coriander or cilantro...but he didn't even notice it! Initially, the flavor seemed a bit 'off' but I followed the directions.

I served it with creamy polenta, would be equally delicious with egg noodles or mashed potatoes. The presentation is nice, too!

I've always loved short ribs at restaurants, and wanted to try my hand making them at home. So as a post-valentine's dinner for my husband, I made this dish tonight. The only thing I did differently was use less meat (there was just the 2 of us), and I took the bones off before cooking. Excellent, tasty, perfectly seasoned. My husband was impressed, and I was too! I pared the meal with horseradish mashed potatoes and my husband's spinach sautéed in garlic, jalapeño and sweet soy sauce.

So yummy - made for the second time for Father's Day. Served with the Cheddar Grits recipe (Gourmet version) and it was divine! It's also a perfect timing match, because I started cooking the grits shortly after getting the ribs in the oven. Since the grits need an hour to bake, they finish while you're finishing the ribs on the cooktop. Left out the garlic, but kept all else exactly the same.

My family loved this recipe!! I used boneless shortribs and only the chipolte chiles in adobo as I didn't have the other chiles on hand. Didn't miss the anaheims, but would try next time. Also, be sure to use the low sodium broth. I again did not have on hand and used regular broth - felt the sauce was a bit salty. I didn't have much time, so after browning the meat with the seasonings, and cooking the onion and garlic, I put all in a crock pot on low for the day, then took the lid off for the last 30 min or so to let liquid evaporate and the sauce thicken. Turned out fabulously!! I would never hesitate to crock cook this again and can't wait to make it again! I layered the ribs in 2 layers, but in the crock pot they cooked just fine. Try to make enough for leftovers! Might try using stew meat in the future also!

This was fabulous. My son declared it the best shortribs he's ever had & is making it for his lady friend & family in San Diego. I left out the coriander & used chipotle chili powder, which is terrific. Also left out the extra chilis at the end as well as the cilantro. If you had 5 forks, I'd give it that.

Great flavor. Was in a rush so opted for an oven bag (325 degrees for 2.5 hrs). I used a can of no-salt diced tomatoes (undrained) and dried cilantro (what I had on hand)instead of ground coriander. Reduced the garlic and used a chuck roast like many others. Let cool until the next day and shredded the meat. Fat lifted off easily. Added some cornstarch to thicken.

In fact, I keep short ribs in my freezer so I can have them on hand to make this dish for entertaining (tomorrow night I'm making it for a business dinner we are hosting). It is a great do-ahead dish, where it can simmer on the stove while the last minute side items are cooked. I serve it with spanish rice and homemade roasted corn salsa. Delicioso!

my husband loved this. I liked it alot too. Just the right amount of spice. I don't think it was too spicy for most spicy adverse people. I do think there was a lot of liquid but I will use it as a sauce for rice another day. If I had cut back I couldn't have covered the ribs with the liquid.

I wanted to make this as a special Monday night treat for my special Monday night man, but I Failed to Read the Recipe Past the Ingredient List. Crap! I didn't let the ribs sit in the rub, just threw it on and seared them, and instead of braising in the oven, I just let it stew on top of the stove. I wound up having to add a lot more liquid but the ribs tenderized in about an hour, so if you find yourself in a hurry, this is a feasible option. Beyond feasible. Special Monday night man (who is also the Special Other Days of the Week Man) said he felt like he was "eating at Craft or something." If you do opt for the stove top method, as I did, I would recommend not increasing the liquid with all chicken broth, as I did. It came out a tiny bit on the salty side, and I think water would have done just fine. Or maybe I would use a nice sweet dark beer. Other changes were adding about a cup of chopped celery along with the onions and garlic, which had the desired effect of increasing the vegetable content a little bit although next time I think I will use parsnips or turnips instead, and making some "lime crema" (sour cream, lime zest, lime juice, and salt.)

Oh, my...this was so incredibly delicious. I used one cup of chicken broth and a whole can of diced tomatoes with the juice, but other than that I followed the recipe.

I've made this twice now and my husband LOVES it. My only suggestion would be to increase the tomatoes and reduce the stock, perhaps by half. I used a (drained) 14 oz can of tomatoes, which came out to 8 packed ounces. I'd add an additional can. You could probably even get away with omitting the stock entirely and not draining the tomatoes. And one other thing, I know I've never cooked this long enough for it to thicken down to a spoon-coating sauce, so I'm contemplating adding a bit of cornstarch at the end next time.

This recipe had very good flavor. The beef ribs at the market where I shop looked terrible, very fatty and not much meat so I like a few others opted for lean, boneless pork ribs. They were so tender they fell part, maybe too much so but they were really good over mashed potatoes. Will try again with beef ribs when I can find good ones and will also add a little more chipotle chilies, it could have been spicier for our taste.

This dish was excellent - meat fell off the bone, great flavor, no problem with it being too fatty. However, contrary to the experience of most reviewers, we found this extremely hot (and we do like spicy dishes). Next time I will try using less of the chipotle chile sauce.

This dish was easy, and delicious! The sauce did not thicken enough to stick to the ribs like a rib sauce, but it did not matter- I did use just a touch of flour to thicken it. I served it in a big bowl over white rice, which soaked up the sauce. The meat was so tender, it was falling off the bone! It was loved by all.

Like another reviewer, I used country pork ribs. Turned out great. Since I am on a low carb diet, I served this with mashed cauliflower mixed with cheddar cheese and sour cream - really good! I also used poblano pepper rings instead of the recommended pepper (not available). The only change I might make next time would be more chipotle peppers - I though it could use a little more of that hot, smokey taste.

This recipe could be made in the pressure cooker and would save a lot of time and steps. Good flavor, but too time consuming for an okay flavor.

While the flavor of this dish was good, I thought it was a lot of work/time to waste on a poor cut of meat. If I ever make it again, I'll use a much less fatty cut of beef. The short ribs produced copious amounts of grease that I tried to spoon off. Also, I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce never thickened up. It would have taken another hour of simmering at least, so we gave up waiting and just ate it. It was like a thin greasy chili, with not enough meat in it.

Used sliced red pepper rings and the flavour was still delicious. Used chipotle powder in the rub instea of chili powder. Excellent if you can find it! Great comfort food on a cold, snowy night!

What a great recipe!!! It was very good with garlic mashed potatoes the first time, but chose to go with the "mexican" flavors and served it with hot, fresh corn tortillas the second time. It won raves from my guests. This is a winner.

This is a fabulous recipe. I have made it 3 or 4 times since Christmas Eve and everyone LOVES it. I followed the recipe pretty closely and served it with steamed rice. Definitely one to keep making over and over.

This is a delicious recipe. My husband and daughter both loved it as well. However when I asked my butcher for well trimed 3 inch ribs, he informed me he was a butcher not a carpenter (smile) so mine were four inch. I did not add the cilentro, it is one of the few herbs I strongly don't like. I served it with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes with goat cheese and garlic. I also used what we call "green chiles", couldn't find the other names. It is a keeper.

I was unable to find short ribs and substituted country style pork ribs...wow!! What a great dish! We served it with cheese grits to soften the spicy edge. This will become a house specialty.

This was great! Someone from California asked if anyone had ever used roasted/peeled, etc. peppers instead of Anahiem chilies--well, we did and it worked out great. They were from my garden, and I had roasted them under the broiler and froze them in September. I defrosted, peeled and deseeded them. I also put them in at the beginning of the simmering rather than the end. We loved it!

We enjoyed this recipe and would make it again. Next time, though, I would reserve some of the chipotle sauce and use it at the table like a gremolata.

I thought this was great, and with short ribs, slow and low is the way to go. Let it go for hours, if you want (who cares if the meat falls off the bone before it makes it to the plate) - that's what braising is all about. As far as the Pot Roast comments, I'm sure it's good, too, but a pot roast and short ribs are hardly interchangeable.

We used boneless short ribs from Costco. Don't worry about over cooking, we cooked an additional hour. Remove as much fat as you can, it will be quite reduced after skimming off the fat but the flavors mellow, then add 1/4 cup cream (this is not a low cal recipe). Buy good quality corn torillas and wrap the meat (semi-shredded), top with cilantro, lime and maybe a little sour cream. Black beans as a side and a salad. Yum

I am also on a low-carb diet and this recipe fit the bill perfectly! I used boneless short ribs and they came out tender and delicious! The taste is similar to Chile Colorado, but I like this dish better. It was great served with sauteed spinach.

This dish is drop dead awesome. I could not get nice lean short ribs so I used a small lean pot roast and I also could not get fresh or dried Anaheim Chiles so I used fresh Poblanos. I can't wait to make this for my extended family.

This was absolutely delicious! I left out the Anaheim peppers, because I could not find these at the grocery. I also forgot to add the cilantro at the end. Nevertheless, the dish was fabulous. I served it, as suggested by others, with garlic/goat cheese mashed potatos - so yummy with the gravy.

Hey, some kindness here? Janet is allowed an opinion too, not everyone loves short ribs. Even if well trimmed they are pretty fatty throughout. Give people credit for trying something new and allow for individual opinions.

Thought this was a delicious dish--made a mistake and added beef broth instead of the chicken but it sure tasted wonderful. My husband thought it was too spicy but he ate it anyway! Even the dog liked licking the plates! (I have a dishwasher.) Would certainly make it again.

Very tasty and very easy!! We had it with mashed potatoes first time and rice the second. A little too spicy for my 8 year-old--will cut down on the chipotle pepper next time.

WAY to much fat, even after I refrigerated it to solidify the fat to better skim it off. Flavor was tolerable. Would not make it again.

Fixed this recipe for family and it was so outstanding I am having a dinner party and tripling the recipe. I hope I have left overs, but I doubt it. Superb!

All the positive aspects have been dealt with by earlier reviewers. Just want to comment briefly on the review by "A cook from California". Did this person pore through his thousands of recipes to find that it was "suspiciously" similar to one for briased (sic) ribs? Ever hear of parallel events in history? If someone has a useful criticism, let us hear it. Otherwise best not to demonstrate one's encyclopedic knowledge of Cookbooks of the World.

A great recipe! We will be making this again soon.

I have not made it yet. Have cooked pork country style, boneless ribs in crockpot with BBQ sauce and salsa. Since I am a lazy cook, I would try this in the crockpot. And would use boneless ribs. They shred easily and can be wrapped in a large tortilla. Have had the following available to add to burro-rice, black beans, refried beans and even papaya. Serve with a salad and flan for dessert.

This was a fantanstic dish! I was a bit skeptical about the ingredients but it turned out to be an excellent flavor. I couldn't find the fresh Anaheim peppers so I used the dried version. I thought it was going to be very hot but my 3 and 5 year olds loved it. I think I will try this as a pot roast since I really don't care for short ribs and the meat in my pot roast(shoulder) seems to be the same - fork tender.

This dish was absolutely fantastic! I made it with the green beans with marjoram,rebell peppers, and almonds (found on this site) , the arugula/radicchio sesame-scallion salad (also on this site), and garlic mashed potatoes. It was the best!

I agree with the other writer re: P. Ervin's comments. There needs to be a much better way of monitoring this section of your great web site.

We loved this recipe with its savory, spicy flavor. I could not find canned chipotle chilis, so I substituted a liquid chipotle puree and it tasted great. To reduce the fat almost entirely, you can chill this for a few hours or overnight, and the fat rises to the top and solidifies so that it is easy to remove. We ate 1/2 of this dish the first night, and on the 2nd night, I tried taking the meat off of the bones, and added 1 can of corn kernels and 1 can of black beans to the mix and sprinkled chopped cilantro over the top. It was more like a stew and was very tasty.

This was wonderful! Served it with safron rice and a green salad and threw in a potato for the final 25 minutes for my husband. The aroma was great and even my 16yo son thought it was a "keeper"

I would give this a 2 1/2. We are currently using home grown beef, from 4-H er, so it has an unusual taste. This recipe really made it taste great. Had plenty of sauce and plan to use left over sauce on a pot roast.

This was fantastic! Served with garlic mashed potatoes & sauteed green beans. I increased the quantity of short ribs from 8 to 12 (basically, made 1 1/2x the recipe for a party of 4) and found this was perfect.

this recipe was suspiciously close to Rick Bayless's briased short ribs with poblamo chiles, only this called for chipotle chiles and Anaheim chiles. That, aside, it was quite tasty and easy to make. Roasted the anaheim chiles first, over an open gas range flame and increased the rest of the proportions. Best served with polenta.

Easy and delicious. Even my friend who typically avoids beef came back for seconds. Made mine with chipotle peppers in adobe sauce which added to the slow heat. Served with garlic-goat cheese mashed potatoes and roast asparagus.

This recipe was fantastic. Even better warmed up later. Had to substitute dried chilies that I softened in boiling water for the canned chipotles. Served it over soft cheddar polenta in soup plates.

MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED THIS RECIPE. I WOULD PROBABLY MAKE A LITTLE MORE OF THE SAUCE--ADD MORE OF THE TOMATOES, CHICKEN BROTH, ONION AND GARLIC. THE SPICE WAS JUST RIGHT. I SERVED THESE WITH MASHED POTATOES.
