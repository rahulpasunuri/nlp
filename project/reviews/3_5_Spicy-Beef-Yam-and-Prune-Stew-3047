This should be called 'spiced stew' not 'spicy' as others mentioned, because the cloves and cinnamon are lovely but not 'spicy' My boyfriend and I LOVED it. I modified the recipe a bit: nearly doubled the garlic and added plenty of red wine (cabernet) and I chopped everything much smaller than suggested (ie: didn't throw the prunes in whole - I quartered them - same with the yams) I will definitely make this again!!

Made this per the recipe with the addition of a little crushed pepper flakes and it was great.

I added extra prunes for texture, chile flakes for heat, and red wine for depth. Fantastic recipe.

I was looking for a recipe for beef & sweet potatoes, and this one did the trick! Great over rice, nice flavour, although I think "spicy" is the wrong term- "spiced" would be more accurate.

I wavered between 2 and 3 stars. I added cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, a half-cup of red wine, a cup of chicken broth, and a quarter-cup of apple cider vinegar, and served it with rice. I didn't find it too sweet, as some of the reviews suggested. It was nice, but missing something.

Delicious! An unexpected combination of ingredients. They work! Served this with orzo.

Far, far too sweet for my taste. One could almost use it for ice cream topping! I much prefer the similar "Veal and Tomato Ragoût with Potatoes, Cinnamon, and Cream" from February 2001. I use Beef instead of Veal. It's much more balanced recipe.

Yummm... This is a cold weather favourite for me. It's not only simple and flavourful but looks beautiful with the bright orange yams. When I can find them I use bite size prunes to avoid them being too big or falling apart when halved. Usually serve a bright green vegetable on the side like broccoli for balance. This freezes well too.

This stew is amazing in the fall and winter. We let the stew cook on the stovetop for several hours-- it's even better the second day. My entire family loves this recipe. We make this every year for the holidays and through January and February. Very hearty, easy, and delicious.

Easy, great flavors and perfect for a cold night. I will be making again.

Four forks because it is delicious and so easy (so easy that I made it 4 days after a c-section). As others have said, the flavor is incredible, considering how few ingredients there are. Very good served over polenta.

This was amazing it was better as it cooled off. I removed the bay leaf and prunes before serving. I used only five prunes. A wonderful change. Thank you

A big hit at our pre-chrismas dinner party. My only change to recipe was to raise the beef:potato ratio. I staged the prep to have the beef done in the morning, and just before dinner threw in yams etc for final stage stewing. I am cooking it again this weekend.

I halved the recipe, subbed ground beef for the chuck, and threw it all in the crock pot. Despite these changes, it was still delicious! Much more than the sum of its parts. Will definitely be making it again.

Fragrant, colorful AND delicious. I will absolutely make again. I substituted carrots and parsnips for the yams and used a splash of caberet for deglazing after browning the meet.

The prunes don't work for me. Texture of the prunes was not nice - kind of slimy. Unfortunately, it makes a lot and we don't throw food out :( We froze and reheated but that didn't help. We won't be making this recipe again.

Quite interesting and nice for a change. A bit on the sweet side. I cut up my prunes and think leaving them whole might have them look better, when cut up they lose their shape and become unsightly. Would make again.

This is so easy and so flavorful! The colors are amazing--and this receives raves from my family. It's become a family favorite. PS: it freezes beautifully.

wow. this was a culinary spice delight-the combos were strange to me, but so yummy. i didn't have prunes on hand so i used carrots and it came out very good.

I've made this many times. It is a sweet stew, but the cinnamon cut the sweetness, I found. Delicious and easy.

Reeeeaaalllly good! I'd have given it four forks if it didn't have to simmer quite so long. Hubby loved it, which means it's definitely a keeper. Made it exactly as written, and I wouldn't change a thing.

i really liked this (3 1/2 forks actually) - especially since it is somewhat different than the traditional beef stews with carrots and potatoes. i also used red wine to deglaze the plan, cooked it longer, but also added a little chipotles that really blended in nicely with the yams and beef.

This is so easy and tastey. Used 1/2 cinnamon stick, and it turned out fabulous. Might be great over mashed potatoes, but it is great by itself

I added most of the spices other viewers suggested but added Cumin and 10 slices of Jalapenos. I did not have prunes at home so used dates (it tasted delicious!) Also added 1 1/2 C. wine with 2 Beef Boullions. It only took 1 1/2 hours to cook tender meat and to speed things up, I used canned yams since I didn't have fresh at home. Got many raves.

This recipe has a good base but the foundation needs to be built up. I will make the dish again but I changed up the recipe to suit my tastes. I coated the meat with a mixture of flour, salt and pepper before browning. I increased the garlic to 6 cloves finely minced and fried that up with the onion beef mixture. I made sure to salt and pepper the mixture each time I added another component to the recipe. I added a can of beef broth and partially drained the tomatoes before adding them. I charred and peeled two Anaheim chilies, then chopped them up finely and added them during the last ten minutes of cooking. I also found that this recipe needs at least 2 1/2 hours cooking time; the meat was not fork tender and a little tough with the cooking times specified in the recipe.

GREAT flavors, but their proportions need work. I like somewhat sweet dishes and am not a big meat eater, however, next time I make this dish (and I plan to) I will double the beef. It needs more meat. I will also cut the yams smaller and quarter the prunes (and adjust the cooking time accordingly). Their flavor is best blended with the meat and with such big chunks its hard to mix them together when eating. To increase the savoriness of the dish I may also add a bit of cumin next time, or follow the advice of another reviewer with a bit of red wine. Overall the flavor was great -- just a little too much of a good thing!

Too sweet for my taste - the combination of sweet tomatoes, sweet potatoes, cinnamon, and sweet prunes needs to be offset by another flavor. I thought perhaps something hot, or something tangy might be just the ticket.

YUM!! This turned out wonderfully. A great winter stew. Very good with rice.

I never liked beef stew until I tried this recipe. This is one I'll keep. I did make a few changes though. I doubled the amount of prunes and added more yams. I also like my stew a bit thinner so I added a bit of red wine for flavor and some water to equal a cup more liquid. I liked the way it came out.

This is a delicious fall/winter dish. I made it with the ingredients listed and it was very well flavored.

Yummy over noodles on a cold rainy night. Changed it a bit , ok probably a lot, by adding 2T Tamarind concentrate,2 sliced &seeded chilies,and I was out of parsly so cilantro did the crowning honors...got raves so I guess it worked, A KEEPER!
