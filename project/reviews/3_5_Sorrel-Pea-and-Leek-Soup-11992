I won't rate this recipe, because the deer got the better part of my sorrel and I didn't have anywhere near the amount the recipe calls for. I made the soup anyway, to use the remainder of the sorrel, and it tastes basically like creamed peas (the deer did not get the peas, thank goodness, and mine are very good). Which is to say: if you don't have sorrel, you'll get vichyssoise with peas, good but without the wonderful lemony element that is probably what earned this soup its high rating.

I planted sorrel about four years ago because my grandmother shared fond memories of the sorrel soup she enjoyed as a child and i wanted to try it. We bought some jarred soup from the store to give her as a treat, but she said it wasn't as good as she remembered. Gram was about 90 then and she passed before I had a chance to try making some soup from my crop for her. This was my first attempt. I enjoyed this soup and since I didn't have a frame of reference asked my european born spouse if this soup agreed with her sorrel soup sensibilities. She liked it very much! I'll enjoy this soup and remember my Gram.

Wow! Made with sorrel from our garden (this is my first time growing it) this is a fabulous soup. Followed the recipe exactly, but used light sour cream, and it doesn't need any modifications. A lovely green color, this would be perfect for a St Patrick's day luncheon. We will continue to grow sorrel so we can continue to make and enjoy this soup. To the lady who used yogurt instead of sour cream, these two products have completely different tastes and seriously different effects on the outcome of the soup. Yogurt would radically change the flavor. Try it agin with sour cream. You may be astonished at the results.

Perfect way to start the spring: go out in your garden and enjoy the sorrel. Great recipe! Wouldn't change a thing.

Hmmm, this was pretty good. Not as good as other pea soup recipes on this website. I pureed some soup with basil (good), some with dill (not as good), and some as stated (possibly the best). Also, the garnishes of egg and thin sliced sugar snap pea were nice.

This is a lovely use of sorrel. Well balanced and light enough for a starter. We've had it with sour cream, but appreciate the lighter flavor from fromage frais.

Why do people change the recipe, then write how much they hated the result? Anyway, this is exactly the way I make my potato leek recipe, actually, an old Polish recipe, I remember from my childhood. So, now, I plan to add sorrel, since just this yr I have become a fan of it in soups.

I haven't tried this yet but will - just noticed a couple of days ago that the sorrel is coming up nicely in our allotment garden here in Glasgow. We also have some leeks which have overwintered and are at their peak just now. The only reason I'm writing before I make it is to say to the previous reviewer socalqtpi from Pasadena, CA that he or she HAS NOT MADE THIS SOUP EITHER - almost every ingredient was substituted and the method was altered throughout. It's pretty rich, don't you think, to rate a recipe with one fork and give it lots of verbal abuse when what you made does not even remotely resemble what the other reviewers rated? So I will give it four forks in advance because I actually know what sorrel tastes like (delicious, especially in combination with peas). BTW, I always try and make a recipe as stated first time round and then substitute, if appropriate, when I make it afterwards - seems only fair.

This was a really good soup. Easy to make and refreshing for a summer dinner. We used sorrel from the garden, it grows like weed all year, so I am always looking for new recipes. Forgot to add the sourcream, but we didn't miss it.

This is really good soup. I served it hot, and it turned out it does NOT need egg as a garnish when hot. We did use chives as the garnish instead of sorrel (I didn't have enough sorrel) and it was perfect. Other than that, I made exactly as is, using baby peas, and loved it. I also didn't add the last 1/2 cup of water - definitely unnecessary. Enjoy!

As it's spring and I was ending our dinner party with a lemon cake, I jumped on the sorrel in the market. Made a small amount of the soup as they didn't have much sorrel, and my guests adored it. I added lemon just before I served it, making sure the balance was correct. The soup and the cake made perfect bookends to the meal.

Absolutely delicious. A great use for sorrel. I didn't add water, used 2 cups of chicken broth. I didn't have lemon, so left that out. The recipe says to thin with additional water, I found it was just the right thickness for my family. I served hot becase it's a cold, spring day here on the island in the Pacific Northwest, where I live. Will definitely make again. It doesn't need a kick. Far too many people don't know how to enjoy foods without an addition of hot peppers. I love hot peppers, but some things were meant to be subtle. Eat and enjoy!

I was so hopful about this recipe, but I just didn't get it. I found it way to tangy. I used yogurt instead of sour cream, but that shouldn't have made THAT much difference. I tried to love it. Def better cold, if at all.

Simple recipe, great taste, warm or cold. To a fellow cook from Los Angeles: sorrel is cheap at ethnic (European) grocery stores; I just got some last week at Jons supermarket--50 cents a bunch.

This is a wonderful and simple recipe, made it many times. Sorrel is very expensive in the US, in Europe it is called sour spinach and cheap. So, forget the sorrel, use a bag or bunch of fresh spinach instead and add enough lemon juice or white wine vinegar to give it a slightly sour taste. Serve with good bread, hot or cold, it's a lovely light meal.

Didn't add sour cream or lemon - cut back on the water. Very good hot or cold. Great use for sorrel.

I needed to use up some sorrel in my garden. I added some cayenne pepper. It was really quite bland without it. It needed a little something to carry the flavor. Cayenne or Tabasco would work.

This is a really divine soup if your sorrel is right out of the garden. It is such a hardy plant, it comes back every winter and has for years. Sorrel has such a wonderful, fresh lemony flavor; I wish I could find more receipes for it. I served the soup hot because it is cold outside here now. My family really loved it.

This soup was a nice spring treat but it needed quite a bit of lemon juice to give it enough kick. Great use for sorrel.

This soup is wonderful! It is also one of the most unusual soups I've ever had - definitely not mainstream, but well worth trying. If you don't like cold soups, try it hot. It works very well as a hot soup.

I substituted 1/2 spinach, 1/2 sorrel and parsnips instead of potato. Gave a much better flavor. Also used white pepper and cut back on the water. Delicious.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I was happy to use up some of the sorrel from our garden, but I thought this soup was rather boring and tasteless. If I do make it again, I'll try to jazz it up--maybe add some Tabasco or garlic or something to give the flavor some depth.

Quick, easy (especially if you have a huge sorrel plant in your garden!) and tasty.
