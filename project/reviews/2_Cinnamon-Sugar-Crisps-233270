I would definitly not make this recipie again as listed. The butter burns in the pan at 500 degrees and fills your house with smoke. I had to modify this recipie by melting the butter in a bowl in the microwave and brush it on both sides of the tortilla with a pastry brush. I also covered my pan in foil and changed the foil between batched. I made about 24 tortillas worth for a party and found this to be the best method. Don't wait until they are brown in the oven. They go from brown to burnt very quickly. They will still crisp up when you pull them when they reach a blond color. Very good served with cinnamon ice cream, whipped cream & caramel.

This was a quick and easy snack. I was craving something sweet but really didn't feel like a putting in a lot of effort and this was perfect. Looks and tastes kinda like elephant ears from the carnival only better b/c you can reduce the sugar. I used less butter and it still worked out great.
