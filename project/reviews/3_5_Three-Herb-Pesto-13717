Plenty of changes and it came out nicely: I halved the recipe, so about half of everything; did not have fresh mint so added extra parsley and a bit of extra basil; and skipped the balsamic vinegar. Only minced the garlic and that was fine, no chunks left or anything. So basically you end up with a more traditional pesto - which was very good. Will probably try the mint once the garden is going, and not just the few potted herbs!

This is a great pesto, but it overwhelms the delicate taste of the tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. Would be better used with pasta. For a truly outstanding tomato salad recipe, make the classic Insalata Caprese instead. You will be amazed at how great simple tomatoes and cheese can taste!

Delicious use of herbs for summer. Did fine in the cuisinart. If want it more liquidy could add more olive oil. I mixed the pesto with pasta and it was great!

This was pretty easy to put together but I had to add water to the blender to get it to puree. Still it was a great way to use up summer herbs. I marinated chicken breasts in it then grilled. It was good but my favorite pesto is always going to have a bright sunny hit of lemon juice in it.

Awesome! This is the only pesto recipe I have ever made, and it's the best. I also like pesto mayonnaise with burgers - it's simple...combine 2/3 cup mayonnaise with 2 tablespoons of the this pesto recipe and voila!

I have been making this Pesto ever since it come out in 1994. It is my favorite pesto recipe, goes with everything and it freezes well. Sometimes I add more herbs.

we love garlic and we love balsamic vinegar but this wasn't the recipe for us. both flavors were much too pronounced and really overwhelmed the herbs.

This is a wonderful pesto. The balsamic vinegar adds complexity to the herby, garlicky flavor. I'll most definitely make this again.

Excellent pesto!! This is a very delicious and versatile pesto that can be used as one would use basil pesto. Of course I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and used aproximately equal quantities of herbs. I would definitely make this again!!

I made this recipe at the end of last summer, in an attempt to use up the fresh herbs that were in my garden--plenty of basil, oregano, mint, and even some fresh parsley (which I added to the mix of herbs). It is a wonderful recipe. (I used extra-virgin olive oil, Grey Poupon, I believe.) I froze my pesto in small zip-lock freezer bags, laid them flat on a baking sheet, and froze them solid. When they were frozen solid, I took them off the baking sheet and stacked them in my freezer. This recipe is a winner, and freezes just beautifully. Your house will smell like heaven for a day or two after you make this pesto, too!

You need to specify what type of olive oil to use since there are so many out there. The type used can make all the difference in how it will taste.
