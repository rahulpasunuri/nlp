Just fancy enough to make you proud, but not too hard. I made with Lurpak (Danish cultured butter), in a madelaine pan. The timing was okay, maybe cut a minute off, since the madelaine is shallower than a true financier. Nice light texture. Question, I toasted whole raw almonds in their skins and put them in the cuisinet...is there a way to peel them first? I didn't, since these were for family, but if I made them for company, I would want to.Thanks

This is so tasty and incredibly easy. My only change was to add 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla (I can't help it!). And I used European butter, which I suppose could have made them cook slightly faster due to a lower water content. I made them in muffin pans. I would say definitely watch them closely in the last 7 minutes. Mine were cooked in 3 minutes less than the recipe called for. In the muffin pans, it makes about 18.

One more modification to add, in addition to brown butter: I also toasted the almond flour on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F, until light brown. Delicious!

So I made these with several changes and they were delicious! I used toasted pecans, and once the butter was browned, I steeped an earl grey teabag in it. Overall it had a great nutty/fruity flavor. I made these as a cake (added a little baking powder and honey instead of all the confectioner sugar) and covered with the lemon cream cheese frosting I found here too. Amazing, must try!

So I haven't made these yet, but I was researching a bit and a lot of other recipes for financiers say to use brown butter, not just melted butter. This is supposed to give them that nutty flavor some of the reviewers said they were missing. Hope this tip helps, I'm making them tonight!

Such a simple, classic, and delicious base recipe that yielded a lovely crusty exterior and a moist cake interior. In addition to the classic almond, I also added ground pistachios and pine nuts. Also, as suggested by the other reviewers, I browned the butter. In the absence of financier molds, I used two muffin tins. The final modification was a topping of fresh sliced strawberries on top of each financier before popping them in the oven.

Fantastic, classic financiers. I had to change the cooking times slightly (7 minutes, 6 minutes, and 5 instead of 7-7-7), but i'm pretty certain that's just because my oven gets moody above 400 degrees. I also don't own financier molds, but Wells' assurance that muffin tins work just as well is true. I used a regular, home-size muffin tin, cups filled about 3/8- or 1/2-inch, and they came out beautifully.

these were a little sweeter than i expected, but still very delicious. the batter was not thin as the recipe suggests, though perhaps this is because my almonds were not ground finely enough? i'll definitely use browned butter and toasted nuts next time, and possibly reduce the sugar as well. these would be delicious with some lavender thrown in too...

I made these in large muffin cups and they were so good. Very different from any muffin or quick bread I have ever made.

I echo all the positive reviews and add that these keep very well! Most of them were scarfed down, but one was forgotten in a ziplock bag for a week or more, and was still delicious.

I live in Paris, so we're surrounded by bakeries that have the most delicious financiers. But, this recipe truly rivals those found at the best bakeries. And to top it all off, it's too dangerously easy to make. My four year old pretty much made them herself. We also filled mini kugelkopf flexipans with this dough and they came out a bit more moist, but still delicious.

I have really enjoyed this recipe. Then again I love anything almond. I have reduced the sugar to 1 cup and even reduced the butter. They came out fine. I baked these in mini muffin pans.

This was the first recipe i tried. I have made many others. THIS IS THE BEST. I will often add one or three fresh rassberry or blueberry to the top. The one problem i have...family and friends devour them within hours. Enjoy. They are worth every effort to make and to share with others.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was fast and easy, and a very elegant finish to a meal. Next time I would use mini tartlet pans so the servings are more manageable (I used 4" tart pans- way too big) and there would be a higher proportion of crunch to soft middles. I added a sprinkle of chopped fresh apricots and served with creme anglaise (made with the leftover yolks!), very very tasty.

this was A VERY FATTENING RECIPE, so what i did was cut down a bit instead of 5 eggs i used 4, instead of 1 2/3 cup of sugar I used 1 cup. i also didnt have enough almonds so I used a bit of coconut. delicious!

these are wonderful little cakes.made them in small muffin tins but otherwise followed recipe exactly.nice texture outside and very tender inside.next time might toast almonds first or add about 1/2 tsp almond extract.also think these would be great made with fresh hazlenuts.

Very good but not heart stoppingly fantastic. I would brown the butter AND toast the ground nuts, and maybe add an teaspoon of almond extract.

I can't rave about this enough. 1. It takes almost no time, clean up is a breeze and 2. the most important, they are delicious! Just as the recipe described. They are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I made mine in regular muffin cups but next time I might try the mini cups too. It's true this is'nt a really sweet cake. Think of it as a breakfast or tea cake or eating at 1:00 in the morning cake. You get the idea.

I tried to make these for a party. For some reason, the batter only made 6. I even tried it a second time and it did the same thing again. the pan I used had nine 2 by 4 rectangles. Maybe a true financier is shallow? Please reply to JDugbo@aol.com. I would really like to try this again.

Made this as one of two desserts for a Valentine's Day party, and got great reviews. I used mini tart pans with removable bottoms, and for the butter,I cook it until golden brown and has a nutty fragrance, 12 to 15 minutes and then let it cool.

I love financiers, I found the recipe very easy to do. I found the little cake a little greasy and heavy. I used a bag of 125g of finely ground almond which was almost 1 1/2 cups! and it was a little too much almond (1 cup is probably the right amount, not 140g). I followed the baking time and they came out lovely. I also used a 12 muffins baking pan.

This is exactly like the financiers available in the patisseries near our place -- I was so excited to find it. The only issue I found is that the cooking time made these a tad too overdone for my taste -- next time I won't leave them in the oven after cooking. Could just be our oven, though!

I was somewhat disappointed with these - I found them to have a strange texture, and not at all sweet like I anticipated.

I love these. I made them in all sorts of shapes and they were all good but you get more yummy edges with the small ones. Just got to figure what to do with all the yolks left over, now.

The most delicious little cakes I've ever made! I made it using mini-muffin pan, one recipe makes perfect 24 pieces. Do follow the instruction on baking, except that I reduced it by half for my pan, all came out perfect. I'm not sure how fine should I grind the almonds but I still had tiny chunks of it that gives it a nice crunch. I also will be more generous on the salt, perhaps about 1/2 t. to give hints of salty taste on the crust. It's rather rich though but very yummy!

I baked these luscious little cakes for an afternoon tea, with finger sandwiches, scones and all the rest of it and they were perfect. Because of the baking process, the outside is lovely and crisp, with the inside tender and sweet. They are also very simple, and were adored by all who tasted them.
