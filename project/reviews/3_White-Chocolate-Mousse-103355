This is just basically whipped cream flavored with white chocolate. Used as a topping on another dessert is fine, but this is not a true mousse dessert. Might as well just eat whipped cream if that's the case. A proper mousse is made with fluffy egg whites folded into the chocolate- cream-(plus optional liqueur) mix. And in mousses using dark chocolate, even the yolks are mixed into the chocolate, and whipped whites and whipped cream are added to lighten and turn it into a mousse - and sometimes the whipped cream isn't even mixed in, but just dolloped on top. Check any French recipe website, that's what mousse is, classically. It's actually all about the eggs holding all the chocolate and liqueur flavors together in a tasty cloud.

Delicious. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate, which worked fine. I cut the recipe in half, added 1 Tbs. of lemon zest to the white chocolate/cream mixture and used extra whipped cream to the part that you fold into the chocolate. Mousse is so tricky, though. Keeping everything at a cool temp is key. I plan to use the mousse as a filling to a white cake with lemon frosting.

I made this to go with another strawberry shortcake recipe and it was wonderful! It was far better than just whipped cream!

I thought this was great. The first time I made this I served strawberries over it, and the next time I added blackberries to the strawberries. The white chocolate is subtle, and is a perfect combination to the berries! The most recent time I made this I added some key lime spread, and it was phenomenal! To those people who complained about this being not much more than white chocolate flavored whipped cream--what else would you expect when all you do is whip cream and add white chocolate? The recipe is delicious, especially when used with the right ingredients.

Easy. Delicious. Different. What else could you want in a dessert recipe. Served it with raspberries. Have made it several times and will again!

I've made this recipe for so many occassions I can't remember. It's so simple and the results are always leaving my guest requesting the recipe. Some hints... do not over whip the whipping cream; white chocolate butter is not appealing! Also, a little goes a long way. 4 oz. servings are more than enough. Topped with a raspberry sauce made from frozen raspberries, sugar and lemon juice cooked together, this is delicious. Add a little mint to the top of this and you have a very "Christmas looking" dessert!

Fantastic dessert, either alone or with berries. Very easy to make and impressive to serve. Rich and delicious.

This is not meant to be eaten as a mousse: it goes over the strawberry shortcakes....and with that, it is terrific! The shortcakes are not that sweet so it is just the right topping: but eating it alone would not be appealing, I agree

my 11 year old come up with the best review - "yuck, this isn't mousse" that is what I get for quick, easy and inexpensive. We froze the left overs. May be it is bette as frozen mousse.

I had such high hopes for this recipe. It sounded so good paired with the strawberry shortcake. I used excellent quality white chocolate and good local cream. And the end product... tasted like the super-sweet whipped cream that comes in a can. It was kinda depressing. Ah well. Live and learn.

This recipe is a compliment to the strawberry shortcake recipe included on this site - it's excellent in lieu of whipping cream, but I wouldn't make it as a stand-alone.

I don't understand why this is called mousse, it is more just a flavoured whipped cream. However, as such, I enjoyed it, as I've always found regular whipped cream really boring, and in future i will use this in it's place.

I agree with earlier reviewers - this is not really up to scratch for adults (unfortunately I only read reviews after buying all ingredients and decided to plough on ahead anyway). I would possibly make it for a 6 year old's birthday party but only because children have uneducated palates. Incredibly sugary and not really a typical mousse-more like a melted chocolate sauce. Never again!

This was a great dessert to make for people who are used to store bought desserts. I made chocolate cups to serve it in by melting chocolate and spooning it into a muffin paper. Refrigerate slightly and coat once more with chocolate. Peel the paper off of the chocolate and fill with mousse. Drizzle with more melted chocolate. Appearance is everything!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I love white chocolate. I followed the advice and served it with fresh blueberries and strawberries, which really makes it great. I served the whole thing over angel food cake which was very good--a kind of decadent berry shortcake.

Great recipe! Quick and easy, everyone loved it! Totally awsome with fresh berries. I don't think this lacked anything - a nice light dessert for spring/summer.

I'm a lover of authentic chocolate mousse. This was very easy, but it just tasted like whipped cream with some white chocolate in it. Great for kids, but I wouldn't serve it to guests again.

i would have given it four forks, but it lacked something. i don't know what. but a lot of the other white chocolate mousse recipes call for liqeurs, maybe that is what it lacks. but since i am not allowed to buy alcohol yet, i guess all that will have to wait. it tasted wonderful with some fresh fruit, especially berries.
