Wonderful - followed directions exactly = except for straining blueberry mixture before adding cream mixture. Froze beautifully and made exactly 1.5 quarts.

My suggestion is to strain the blueberry mixture before adding the milk and cream. I used a hand sieve over a bowl and this is very easy and definitely worth the small amount of extra effort for smooth and seedless ice cream. Someone else commented this recipe was too large for a 2 quart Cuisinart ice cream maker but - it worked fine for me!

Simple, fresh, outstanding. Add shaved chocolate at the end of the churning for more fun. T his recipe makes a bit much for my Cuisinart machine so I need to scale it back by a cup or so.

I substitute orange juice for the water which adds an overlay to the flavor that intensifies the blueberries. This as become my favorite ice cream flavor. Sometime I add a cup of chocolate chips about five minutes before my machine stops churning. Also, one hour chilling before putting the mixture into the machine is not long enough. Make sure the mixture is fully chilled before putting it into the ice cream maker.

i've been making this since the recipe was first published in 1990. it's my go-to ice cream recipe. you can substitute almost any other berry or stone fruit & have a wonderful ice cream that friends will rave about.

Fabulous!! I skipped the liqueur & substituted lemon peel for the orange, and didn't strain the berry skins out. After 2 days in the freezer, I let sit out about 15 minutes before scooping - - the texture is like a light Haagen Dazs. To make it richer I might try all heavy cream next time. Mmmmm. Love the color too - purple explosion!

I've compared this recipe with the other simpler recipe found on this website and haved decided that this one is needlessly complicated. All the extra essences and liquours really do not add anything to the taste of this icecream. The other ice cream tastes better and I tasted them side by side.

This was pretty easy to make & the flavors aren't bad. I followed the recipe exactly & thought that it was just a bit too creamy for my taste. Next time, I'll use less cream, more half and half. I also didn't strain -- as I enjoy the added "texture" the seeds and skins provide.

It tasted pretty good even with the reduced sugarlime zest instead of orange zest. However, watch out!!!! I put the the blueberry mixture in the blender too soon and it exploded in the blender beacause of the heat. It made a huge mess and the stains are not worth the ice cream.

This was fabulous! Rich and very flavorful. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still very sweet. Next time, I may cut the sugar a bit more. Like others, I also didn't strain and it came out beautifully.

My dad loves blueberries so made this for Father's Day dessert. It is delicious. I served it with cake-like pineapple-macademia nut cookies. But I agree with Bill: straining is not necessary. Plus, it was such a hassle for me and made a huge mess. Tried using cheesecloth: yuck! Next time I won't bother. I did (accidentally) use 2 cups 1/2-&-1/2, 1 cup cream, but still thought it was ultra creamy. Also used frozen berries. The color is pretty outrageous though - don't get this on your white table linens!

This was good and easy. I substituted milk for the half n half and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. It was not overpowering or too sweet. I also substituted the orange zest with some orange juice concentrate. I think it would have been smoother and creamier if I had followed the recipe exactly, but it was still quite good.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it is sooo worth it. This is a very rich and smooth ice cream, and as a bonus, it stays "scoop-able" in the freezer (unlike most other homemade ice creams I've made)!

I simplified this recipe significantly. No orange peel, no Grand Marnier, no straining, and it was still fantastic. Will definitely make again.

Really intense flavor - but not an ice cream you would want to eat every day. Very good dessert for a hot summer day barbecue.

Oh, my gosh! This was wonderful! Very creamy & indulgent. I used light cream instead of the heavy cream and the consistency was just right.

This is delicious and easy to make, compared to the other blueberry ice cream recipe I found on epicurious. For this I used an orange licquer (sp) called Citronage, and I think it worked ok, but using Grand Marnier would give this more oomph. I also skipped the orange peel part, but now think that is a needed flavor. Will definitely try this again...I made it for a date, and he just loved it.
