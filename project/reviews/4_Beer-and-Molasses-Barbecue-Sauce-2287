This sauce is wonderful! We used it as marinade and then as a sauce for wings. Just amazing! I had to substitute the chili sauce with cocktail sauce, ketchup and hot asian chili sauce because I was short on time. I'm not a spicy food person and the sweet followed by the little kick of heat is just right. You can control the heat with more cocktail or ketchup and less chili sauce. I will definitely make this one again!

Very easy, quite tasty. Coated some homemade smoked port in this sauce and it was awesome. Best pulled pork sandwich ever!!

The base recipe is wonderful. The first time I made it as written, it was a hit with guests. The next time I used chipotle Tobasco, it worked fine.Then I used adobo sauce from a can of chipotle peppers, wow, that was great and last night I made it again and used it with stout braised briskett. I used the stout in the recipe also and added asian hot chili and garlic sauce. Everyone thought I was a genius. I'm keeping this recipe handy. It is very adaptable and versatile. My wife does not like sauce and she even admitted it was "pretty good." That says a lot.

Have used this recipes for years. My family's favorite. Can change flavor by changing the beer used, dark...etc. Great on chicken, pork and ribs. No more store bought for us.

Use it on boneless chicken breasts and it was delicious. It really glazed the breast nicely and had a slight spicy bite to it. Definitely a keeper.

Have been looking for a great BBQ sauce; with some additions, this could be 4 star. The first time I made it, I followed exactly, the second time with these changes: Sauted 1 onion, 4 cloves diced garlic in a tbsp olive oil, then added beer, 2 tbsp each honey + molasses; same dijon, chili, soya; added 1 tbsp each worchestershire, cinnamon, black pepper, dry hot mustard; pinch of allspice, substituted: cider vinegar for lemon juice, and ketchup for chili sauce, & sambal oelek for pepper sauce. What I had on hand, and can be adjusted for extra sweetness (more honey/molasses) or spice (more sambal/chili powder) Simmers nicely while ribs were roasting; extra keeps well in the fridge! No more store bought for us!

Excellent mixture of ingredients. Try it, you'll love it! Used Guiness one time and a Sam Adams the other - both tasted excellent.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of the liquid smoke.I thought I had some and didn't. This is delicious. I used the sauce on ribs and there were no leftovers.

Followed the suggestions of the cook from Lake Tahoe as they sounded like modifications I'd agree with. I too used Guiness and added touches of Worcestershire sauce and honey, but I did skip the extra peppers as I thought it had plenty of spice already with the Tobasco called for by the original recipe. All my guests raved, and I personally found it so tasty that I was tempted to sample the chicken breasts I smothered it on.. even though I'm a vegetarian! Simply outstanding - will never buy bottled again and wouldn't think of looking for another recipe.

This was wonderful. I made it and poured it over chicken wings that I grilled. It was the perfect amount of spice and flavor. I would definitely make it again.

Excellent Sauce( I used it with the Clark's Barbecue Chicken recipe. It was great. I think it would be as good with pork or beef.

What a great sauce! Always a hit with guests. I have made the following modifications, which I believe greatly improve the flavor. 1) Double the recipe (you can never have enough) 2) Use Guinness beer (rich dark flavor) 3) Add honey (for sweetness) 4) Add Worcestershire sauce (for tang) 4) Triple the hot sauce and add habanero pepper flakes (to bring up the heat)

this is a very good sauce that was certainly easy enough to put together and would lend itself to several different meats. will definitely do it again, just as it is written.

Made this because I have not found a bottled barbecue sauce that I like. Really happy with this and used it all summer; on chicken steak, ribs. Fabulous!

Excellent sauce! Great with ribs and chicken, it has a nice tangy bite to it. This is a definite do-over!!

I've used this on chicken,beef, and ribs, it's outstanding. On my initial prep. I used a generic chili because it had spices added, however on my next prep I used ancho and chipolte powders and it was outstanding they enhanced the smokey note.

I made this sauce when the recipe was firt published in July 1996 and have used it so many times. It has a GREAT Taste and is best on Baby Back Ribs. If your looking for a Really Good Sauce then this is the one.

I used this sauce on ribs. If was wonderful. One of the best BBQ sauces I've had. It's flavor is full and strong, so I'm not sure how I would like it on chicken. It is, however, the best rib sauce I think you will be able to find anywhere. A must try.

I am always looking for new and interesting barbecue sauces. This one fit the bill! Wonderful taste!

This is a really great sauce for ribs! I've made it several times, once with a dark beer, which I wouldn't do again; it was much better with a regular light beer. Yum!
