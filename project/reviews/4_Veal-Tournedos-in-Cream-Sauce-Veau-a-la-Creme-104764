Wonderful dish. I used veal scalloppini and layered the meat, canadian bacon, and cheese a couple of times per stack. Wonderful! I also tossed some chopped garlic on top after it came out of the oven. A keeper! I also used the Julia Child method for creme fraiche mentioned above.

Go light on the Gruyere. This is a fabulous dish.

It seems to me that the bacon and gruyere taste was too strong for the veal that has a very delicate flavor. Everything was falling apart, it may work better with cutlets. I must say however that the veal was perfectly cooked.

Wonderful! I used prosciutto (because I can't buy Canadian bacon where I live) and a local cheese with a similar flavor to Gruyere. Really great flavor combination. Took the advice of other reviewers and made the creme fraiche with half heavy cream and half sour cream.

Turned out far better than I thought.Don't know what the other reviewer did wrong, but mine turned out fine.

Well, to put it in French, c'est degoutant. This is a mixture of tastes that does not work; and I needed to go for a three hour run just to work it off. Gross.

I made this dish according to the recipe and found it fast and flavorful. I loved how the sauce seemed to make itself in the pan - just give it a quick whisk and serve. My wife and I will certainly make this again.

Had this at gourmet Club last nite! Absolutely wonderful! Plan to serve it to guests next week with Julia's home made creme fraiche, because it is so easy and you can control how much you make!

Absolutely fantastic! It's not like lamb or veal tenderloins are on the weekly shopping list, but when they are... Follow the other reviews advice about the fraiche, it was all delicious. It was a little rich so I used all nonfat creams and cheeses...just kidding!

Wonderful dish! Made it for my mom and fiance - and everyone loved it. Used half sour cream and half heavy cream for the creme fraiche, worked perfectly. Will make it again and again as it was very easy.

Don't buy creme fraiche in the store. In her book "The Way to Cook," Julia Child recommends a mixture of equal parts heavy cream and sour cream to make a quick creme fraiche. I find this works great!

This was easy and quick. The taste is awesome. Suggestions are to put the creme on at the last minute in the oven. I also pan grilled green beans, yellow and red peppers (tossed with garlic pepper). I served the dish on top of grilled french bread with a little bit of garlic powder on the bread. I placed the veggies around the bread. I think my wife thinks I'm taking a french cooking class.

This was wonderful. I not only had to use the Alouette creme fraiche but I also had to use veal ribs. Still my family raved about this dish. We make it all the time now since it is so easy.

This was awsome! I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was WONDERFUL, in spite of the fact that we had to use Alouette creme fraiche (see Kitchen Notebook) because it was all that was available locally.
