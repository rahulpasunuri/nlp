This was terrible. The toatoes didn't work with the anise, and the addition of turnip gave it a less traditional flair. In 20 years of marriage, I've only had 1 cooking disaster like this, and it was in my first year of marriage. There is another recipe, from Gourmet 2004 (I believe) that is MUCH better.

I made this chowder and we love most seafood chowders, it was really good but i added a little more red pepper flake and more basil. The extra basil was great.

This recipe is time consuming but I had some halibut from a vacation which I needed to use. I ended up using 10-12 cups of clam broth, more garlic, at least 5-6 Tbls. of tomato paste (not optional)and only 2 dozen clams for the two of us (froze some chowder and will add more the next time. Use cilantro and serve with a crab leg for a Mexican style soup.

I would cut the recipe in 1/2 & still serve 6-with a salad. I would double the bacon pieces-but not the bacon grease - and add 1-2 more halibut fillets - and add 1-1/2 cup tomato juice. This recipe is good - but a lot of work - so you better like clams.
