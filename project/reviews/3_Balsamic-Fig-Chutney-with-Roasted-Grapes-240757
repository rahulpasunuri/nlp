I couldn't find chai tea bags only liquid black chai tea so I substituted this for the water and it worked great, albeit, half water half tea may have been better. No need to cut fruit just pulse it in the processor til you get the texture you want in the end.

I made this with a friend to give as holiday gifts, but could not resist opening a jar tonight with a lamb curry I made. It was delicious, although I would chop the grapes and figs a little more, as suggested. I also agree that I wish it had more sauce. My favorite part were the roasted grapes.

This was delish. My only feeback is to cut the figs and already roasted grapes into small pieces if you want a chutney that works better on crostini.

the flavour was good but it was too chunky and had no sauce component - I would add more water next time?
