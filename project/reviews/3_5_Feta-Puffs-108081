I used the rough puff pastry dough recipe found on epicurious, and came out very nice. I varied the herbs used, thyme, dill, pepper only. the other reviewers where correct, it filling does not ball up as it is a bit too runny, so I just spooned small amounts onto the dough strips. Since I served this for a dinner party, I made these a few days ahead and froze them (before baking). Then, at the time of the party merely had to to bake them (thaw first) and no mess to clean up.

Oops- I accidentally put all the egg in the filling instead of just a tablespoon-- adjusted for it by adding more cheese but it was still a little runny and hard to work with. Despite this, they came together nicely (but a little more effort to seal/process). I was worried it would taste weird and look awful but it didn't. Didn't have fresh thyme- used a dash of dried. Also, added about 2 T. minced fresh parsley and just dumped the herbs in the filling- much easier. It was great- everyone loved them, thought they were pretty and we were all disappointed when they were gone. PS. If you freeze these for later, be sure to omit the step where you brush the tops with beaten egg. Leave them dry so you can freeze them and do that step just before baking (only).

I thought these were OK, but I doubt I'd make again. They were very pretty--I topped them with the tips of thyme sprigs, so they looked like little flowers on top. While I thought the flavor was a little dull, I may try to fill these with something else in the future--they just looked so good that I might try a variation on the theme. FYI, I blended the cheese too long and it all was way to runny to form into balls. Luckily, I had a lot of feta, so I blended it all over again by hand--I'd definitely recommend this instead using the food processor.

Thought the filling was great. Need better options for folding up the pastry dough.

Definitely takes longer than the 30 minutes prep time mentioned in recipe. Filling did not roll into ball, but worked okay just spooning onto strips - also tried freezing dolops of the filling first - didn't stay frozen long enough to help much. Messy, messy, messy, but end result is good. Next time I will take the suggestion of folding a square over to make triangle -more containment, fewer edges to seal.

These just disappeared at a New Year's Eve party, and everyone agreed that I should make them again! I put the thyme in the cheese mixture, which made them really tasty. I also used sour cream in place of milk/cream. A ravioli cutter worked really well to cut them apart and it gave them a nice edge. I made my strips of puff pastry 2 inches wide. Brushing the tops with an egg wash really makes them golden and shiny when they come out of the oven.

It took forever to wrap the cheese mixture in the pastry since the cheese ends up runny and gooey and doesn't really form into balls. They ended up alright and went fast at my friend's christmas party... but would have been better with brie or a different cheese. I don't think I will make these again with the same kind of cheese...

I just baked a recipe which had been frozen for 3 weeks and they were as good or better than the originals.

Excellent appetizer, very easy and great presentation. I used sour cream instead of cream as suggested by another reviewer. For variety, I made half with double thyme in cheese mixture and half with garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. I can't wait to try other combinations.

These are very attractive looking, but don't taste as good as they look. There was not enough filling for the amount of pastry, so the result was super-bready. The filling was also sort of bland. I could be convinced to try this again, using more filling and possibly adding spinach to the feta. Anyone have other ideas?

I used croissant dough instead of puff pastry. It worked pretty well. I doubled the thyme and added the extra into the cheese mixture. This is a must. Everyone loved them.

I made these at the request of my brother. I was skeptical. However, the puffs were very professional looking, tasty little bites, and worth making again.

Delicious. This was a big hit. I will definitely make it again and again!

A whole lotta puff with too little feta. Cheese mix is delicious but even rolling the pastry (felt forced to do this so would end up w something less doughy ... fyi, did still puff well), turned out way too pasty. Plus: they're only good warm and since they cool off very very quickly ...

Meh...this was only so-so. The stuffing was way too dry, and rather bland.

My guests loved this one! I had never worked with pastry before and I was a little intimidated, but after it finally thawed, it was easy.

I made these for a group cocktail party. Went to get a second taste and they were already gone. Instead of the cream or milk, I used a tablespoon of sour cream. Followed the instructions, but brushed a light coating of egg around edges of each dollop of feta, and then put the second strip on top. Cut into squares and then used a fork to crimp around the edges. They looked like raviolis but when they baked the crimping puffed out and they were beautiful little puffy envelopes and I had no trouble with my cheese melting out. Only other advice, make two batches if you want to get a taste!

An absolute must in everyone's recipe box. Easy! Elegant! Delicious! Wow!

I made this exactly as written, and it turned out fabulous. The strips and squares were simple to create and stayed together well using a pizza slicer to really seal the edges while cutting. I had two sheets of puff pastry, so made a second set adding a dash of greek seasoning, which was also great. So easy and delicious. They go fast!

These were easy and fun to make. They looked beautiful with the fresh thyme sprinkled on top. My only regret? I should have made more, I only got to eat one before they were all gobbled up!

Made this for a recent party. I used dill instead of thyme. Was a big hit even with my teenage daughters friends!!

i have been making these puffs for the past five years using my own recipe which included half cottage cheese half feta cheese. To all the cooks who think the taste was blant, you haven't been using the right feta cheese. I recommend Bulgarian feta from a greek or other east european deli. It's actually less expensive and a lot more flavorful. I really like the fact that you can freeze them. I always made them the day of the party or the night before, and reheated them for a few minutes. Another suggestion is to cut the sheet into 20 squares and then fold each square into triangles. It's less work and looks better.

I've made this twice and it gets good marks for easy prep & looks good coming out of the oven, but I have to say they are a bit bland. I added minced parsley for color & used dried thyme. Pretty, but flavor needs a boost. Use a pizza wheel cutter so the sides can "puff" right--makes a difference & is easy.

Good basic appetizer recipe. Next time I'll fool around with some added flavors some others have mentioned to add a little variety.

This is agreat recipe for appetizer. I would do two things: 1-Mke the cheese balls small, 2-Add to the cheese mixture finely chopped italian parsley.

This went over very well with my guests, but I thought they were just okay. They just seemed a little doughy and bland - like they needed something acidic, like tomato or spinach. I don't know. It's almost like I wanted to dip them in marinara or something. I couldn't eat more than two because the doughiness got to me.

Love this recipe. I added bacon bits to the top when baking to add somemore flavor. It went over really well. I thought I would try sun dried tomatoes next time. Great appetizer.

Very good. I also used dried thyme with good results. The smaller you can make them the better. Fingers got a bit messy with the cheese filling while preparing. No problem though.

I was a dumbass and used filo dough. Guess I should read the recipe more closely. They came out a little on the burnt side for as long as I cooked them. They weren't terrible just a little crispy. I would definitely make them again using puff pastry.

These were awesome! To the cook from Manhattan Beach, I believe the recipe called for Puff Pastry not Filo. Anyway, I rolled out the dough and cut into circles to fit a Dumpling or Goyza press (any oriental market will carry) put a little of the cheese mixture in the middle and pressed together. It comes out as a half circle but it's easier than the other method and you can make more in less time! I also put the cheese mixture in the fridge and was easier to handle. Oh and Trader Joe's feta is very mild and tasty!

I entertain often. This is my new favorite appetizer. It's easy, delicious, looks like it could be served at a 5 star restaurant AND you can make it ahead of time. I put the feta/egg mixture in the fridge for 10 minutes, that makes it easier to work with. I don't bother making it into balls, I simply drop it by scant 1/2 teaspoons on the filo. I've used dried thyme instead of fresh and the flavor is still great. I've found 7 per sheet a little big - filo is so crumbly and you don't want your guests to have to take two bites, it should just be a one bite appetizer.

Very tasty and so simple. Will definitely seal the edges more firmly next time though.

Delicious. The best part is the bit of cheese that oozes out while baking and becomes a bit burnt on the baking sheet. Yum.

Yummy. These were simple and good. Next time I think I will chill before cooking and will try to seal the edges better. I'm not sure the cream/milk was really necessary - it made my mixture a little too runny to form balls. I will try these again, next time adding some sundried tomatoes to the feta mixture.

I made these for a party and everyone loved them. They were relatively simple to make, and definitely tasted better after they had been frozen 2 days before baking (the feta was not as strong for some reason). They were not overly cheesy and they came out very flaky. I used dried dill insteads of thyme and it was fine. I will have to seal them a little better next time because some of the filling came out the sides of some of them, but it didn't detract from the taste. I'll definitely make these again.
