I changed the recipe a little - I used 1 cup of egg beaters and I used spenda for the sugar. I add mixed Honey Roasted nuts, choclate chips and butterscotch chips (so much for saving on sugar!) They tasted good but were very hard - I think that you need the egg qualities - maybe you can do 1/2 egg beater, 1/2 real egg

Very bland, no real flavor and they got very hard very fast.

I did the recipe with whole wheat flour, added a hanful of dried cranberries and some lemon essence... fan-tas-tic!

MMM that *hint* of sweetness peeking through is what I think makes this an "adult cookie" versus the sugar loaded regular versions. Either wet or floured fingers & a heavily floured surface are absolutely crucial for working with this SUPER super sticky dough. I kept the 2nd bake to only 5 minutes per side as I found the texture was already quite nice by then and cookies just needed a light toasting to boost its colour. I'll also note that based on what I had, I substituted: pistachios for almond; amaretto & orange juice for vanilla & almond extracts; and added 2 tbsp of orange zest. Super fragrant!

Yummy! very quick, very easy, very elegant. I didn't bother turning it out onto a floured surface - I just kneaded it a bit in the bowl, placed it on a baking sheet liner, and shaped the log. I'm about to wrap them up as christmas presents, and start on a gluten-free batch - I'll report on that as well!

For a low-fat recipe, these were exceptional. I didn't have almond extract (used vanilla instead) and they still turned out very delicious.

Blah. Very unexciting. The flavor is nice (I love almond extract), but the texture in dry-- it really needs a little butter or oil, or something. The dough was like glue & tough to work with-- which wouldn't have been a big deal if they had tasted a little better. I'll keep searching for another recipe.

I had been searching for the perfect biscotti recipe to satiate my sweet tooth for cookies without being too bad for me- and this one was PERFECT. i halved the recipe when i made it and easily had about 20 thin biscotti. i also doubled the amount of cinnamon, which made them smell amazing, and baked for only 6 min. 30 sec. on each side. i would recommend this recipe to anyone- a friend said it was the best biscotti she's ever had...

This was just what I was looking for: a light, crisp cookie that didn't make me feel guilty eating it. I did a substitution, and it came out fantastic: I doubled the cinnamon, and didn't have any almonds, so I added a 1/2 jar of natural peanut butter. I know that added fat and calories, but the texture was softer, and it had a strong peanut-buttery taste. To dress it up, these would taste great dipped in chocolate; I'd definitely serve them to guests.

fyi - haven't tried it, but if anyone is on the weight watchers plan, it is only 1.5 points per serving

I agree with a previous reviewer. These were good but I would have liked something a little sweeter.I was thinking of adding some cinnamon chips. I did not have enough almonds for a full half cup and that may have made a difference too. But for a low fat cookie these were pretty good

Awesome...my husband says it's so much better than anything you can buy in the store. However, I always like to add more vanilla and cinnamon to mine :)

This recipe is simple and good. You really don't need the artificial flavorings, or to prepare the almonds in any way, and most people can measure 1 tsp baking soda faster than 0.75 tsp... They can be cooked in 80-100 minutes total including clean-up. Do not cut down on flour, since a softer dough will make the biscotti rock-hard instead of nice and brittle. I secretly love them rock hard, because I dunk in espresso anyway. But some people can't chew them like that. If only want to memorize one recipe, you should take this one. - By the way, raisins or cranberries make my kids complain, and coacoa makes them hard as concrete. After 2 years and 30-50 attempts, I still stick with the same basic recipe. - Did I mention that this is my favorite of all times? My wife HATES when I bring them to playgroup instead of sharing with her :-)

Perhaps I have too much of a sweet tooth, but I found this recipe to be pretty boring. I don't think it tastes very good with tea, although with strong coffee or hot chocolate, it was better. They did have a nice crispness and they look good. They would have been better half-dipped in chocolate or dribbled with icing. I think there are much better lowfat cookie recipes out there.

Very good, definitely a coffee/tea dunker! I added about 6 oz. of cinnamon chips instead of the ground cinnamon because I like chunks of nuts, chips and/or fruit in my biscotti. I also reduced the time on the second baking to 8 minutes per side, they're still quite crunchy.

This recipe was great! A hot cup of coffee, tea or milk are great with it.

This is a nice, low-key, "grownup" cookie. I ignored the instructions to shape a loaf--the dough was much too loose for that to be effective. I put it in a loaf pan lined with wax paper. I should have used 2 loaf pans--the dough rises a lot! I just cut each slice in half--doesn't do much for appearances but it tasted fine. Also I don't have a mixer with a dough paddle--it's OK, you don't need one. P.S. low fat is not low calorie. This is not diet food!

These turned out a little harder than most bisotti recipes I have tried, but they are perfect for dunking. Very yummy.

Im not that experienced at the whole cooking scene but i know what good food tastes like, and this biscotti...is GOOD FOOD!! and to those who think the cookie is too hard, dont blame it on the cookie! its the person eating the cookie or cooking it...YOUR SUPPOSED TO DIP IT IN COFFEE!!

I loved it. Never made biscotti before and heard how hard it was. This was easy for a cook-challenged German. For Thanksgiving I will put in some pumpkin, cut out 2 eggs and see how that works. I also want to try it with egg substitute. Has anyone tried that?? I love the fact the recipe has a break down of cal. fat etc. Thank you so much.

Not as tasty as most other biscotti recipes I have tried. Also would not recommend mixing in a mixer--makes the biscotti very hard.

Rating: 4
WOW -- first time making biscotti and it was surprisingly easy and quick. I braced for a rock-hard outcome, given other reviewers' comments. However, the result was just enough "crunch" for dunking. I will never buy biscotti again... and I look forward to experimenting with other flavors.

I have been making these cookies since they first appeared in Bon Appetit to rave reviews from all who tried them. To those who say they are too hard, this Italien treat is not for you.

To Chilliwack, BC: Yep, I know biscotti are intended to be dunked and therefore have a texture more firm than the average cookie. Yet biscotti should not be so unyielding that one cannot eat it absent a beverage. And these cookies surpassed any acceptable level of rigidity. I wasn't exaggerating in my review when I said a child at the school dinner could not bite the cookie.

To the cook who thought they were hard as rocks: are you aware that biscotti is intended to be dipped in coffee to soften it up???

I copied the recipe wrong and added 2 tbs butter instead of 1 tsp vanilla extract....well they turned out delicious anyway! I plan on making them true to recipe again soon, and may use these for gifts in the future...soooo good in chamomile tea at nite!!

This recipe is great, even my husband (hates lowfat anything) like these. Next time I'll make a double batch.

very simple and tasty dish. i used rum instead of the almond extract first time and it still turned out great. an easy crowd pleaser!

At first I did not like the looks of the biscotti and it didn't help that I was skeptical about it being good as well as low-fat, but after I took one bite, I was hooked. While not the most attractive biscotti I have ever seen, these certainly held their own amongst other, higher-fat recipes I have tried. This was scrumptious both dipped and plain. I couldn't stop munching on them, but I didn't feel guilty because they were healthy!

Rating: 4
wow, these are great and very simple to make. i sliced them a little thicker than recommended and cooked them for less time because i prefer for my biscotti not to be crisp. i will definitely make these again!

These cookies are delicious. While not quite as scrumptious as a full-fat butter biscotti, they are wonderful and do not have that make-do but not realy satisfying quality of many low fat desserts. I will definately make them many more times. The only change I made was to increase the amount of almonds by 50% - to 3/4 cup.

These are really great cookies. I added a simple drizzle of frosting (powdered sugar, water, almond extract) and they tasted even better. Next time I'm going to try them with toasted coconut and coconut extract...

I went to Lake Tahoe early this fall. A tree native to the area is the Jeffrey Pine, which has the most amazing bark, smelling of vanilla, almonds, cinnamon, and wonderful things from the oven. It's really something. The trees made me crave these biscotti (one of my recipe staples). I made them again the day I returned. Tasty!! Do try them -- they are gentle and go great with tea.

Great flavor! Tastes kind of like a crisp cinnamon toast. Everyone loved them!

I made this with the recommended accompaniment of Fruit (apricots and cherries) in Spiced White Wine, Bon Appetit, June 1996. The cookies went very well with the fruit and are great on their own. They are also great half done, after their first baking, when they are bit softer. I used less cinnamon than recommended, so the cookies just had a hint, not a strong hit, of the spice.

These are pretty good, but I have not yet found the ultimate. I'm trying Double Choc. Walnut Biscotti (also in this recipe finder) next and hope it's 'the' one. These turned out very hard and only made 20, but still worth making again.

This recipe makes wonderful biscotti. I have added a bit more cinnamon and doubled the almonds (guess they're not so low-fat now), and they're as good as any biscotti I've ever had. They also freeze well in ziploc bags, so that you can munch them over the course of many evenings.

Rating: 4
Everyone who has tried them has asked for the recipe. Not only do they taste good and are low in fat, this is the easiest biscotti recipe I have tried. For even more simplicity, I often substitute a tablespoon of almond filling for the almonds and almond extract; plus I only use 3/4 cup of sugar.

This is a terrific recipe to make and share as a gift with fellow bakers all year round. Coffee and tea drinkers both love the crunchy texture and dieters are grateful for the low fat content. A winning biscotti!

I've already made these delicious biscotti twice...in a week! But as soon as I made them, they are gone the next morning! My family love dipping them in their morning coffee or tea. The best part is, I don't feel guilty eating them, they are really LOW in fat.

This is my favorite biscotti recipe! The biscotti are hard and crunchy (the way I like them best). They're great dipped in coffee, and it's not too sweet.
