I put this recipe in my "never again" file. It took an incredible amount of time and only yielded about 30 cookies. They weren't the prettiest cookies on the platter and didn't taste all that great, either. In brief, not worth the trouble.

I have made this recipie every Christams since my son was four ans he is now sixteen. It is a lot of work but very worth it. These cookies our now a Christmas tradition for our family.

Delicious! I just used a black-raspberry jam that I loved instead of making a whole separate filling, and they were a hit. I've made three batches and ate most of them myself.

Pretty and Yummy may add almond extract next time...**TIP: roll dough out on baking parchment paper, cut out desired shapes, remove extra dough between cut outs, so only the cut out cookies remain on parchment...lift parchment paper with cut outs and place onto a cookie sheet; *placing sheet and all onto trey, bake. Not only do cookies lift off trey easily after baking but you can get them EXTREMELY thin since no handling of dough is required to transfer to cookie sheet :)

These cookies ARE a lot of work, so if you're faint-hearted about baking beware. But I don't get the review that says they aren't popular with children or adults. These are so loved by my family that I have been begged into making them with heart shapes for Valentines Day.

I made these cookies and they went before I could get the platter to the table. The batter is very sticky and hard to work with so the second time I made them I used whole wheat flour and they were even tastier and the batter was easier to handle.

Looked beautiful, but they were not popular with adults or children.

I'm a beginning baker, and have only made cookies from scratch one other time, and I was not only able to make this recipe but it came out fantasticly delicious and impressive to the eye.

These and the chocolate brownie cookies from the Gramercy Tavern were the best. I got raves and demands for the recipes. I will definitely be making these again!

While somewhat tedious, the results were worth it!! Everybody raved about these ccokies. My friends could not believe that I (who have made cookies from scratch perhaps 5 times in my life) could produce such an impressive sweet.

This is a very soft cookie dough. It is critical to have the dough cold and to refrigerate it whenever it gets too soft. A cold rolling pin and surface is definitly helpful. Plus, the cut-out stars are extemely fagile - I increased the size of the cookies and used the smallest star I had to cut out the center. Not worth the trouble! Rainbow cookies are much more impressive for the work.

Just the right amount of tart and sweet. I would definitely make them again.

This is a great recipe! I didn't have fresh cranberries, so I used canned whole cranberries and less sugar, mixed with strawberry jam for the filling. The cookies were delicious. I also made some hearts, which were lovely.

I made these for Christmas and everyone went wild for them. I doubled the recipe and substituted orange rind instead of lemon. They are time consuming but well worth it!

These cookies are time consuming but not difficult. I used grated orange peel instead of lemon peel as I prefer the taste of orange. I wouldn't make them weekly, but they are a rich, tangy, and delicious treat for special occasions. The filling would be excellent for jam tartlets. I would automatically double the whole recipe next time, and, no matter the quantity made, would increase the filling recipe by 1/2.
