A cook from PA: Explain to me the difference between sorbetto and gelato? And if fruit gelato does not use any cream, why call it gelato and not sorbetto? conoscere i fatti prima di parlare.

For the record, true Italian fruit gelato rarely is made with milk.

Pretty good, but a little too sweet for my tastebuds. I'll be using another recipe I have that takes less sugar.

This dish was just ok...For some reason the it didn't freeze in the ice cream maker, just turned to slush. In the end I just had to pop it in the freezer.

I've been making this recipe all summer with whichever fruit is best at the farmers' market . It's always delicious. I've always used powdered egg whites (I have small children) and they don't seem to compromise quality at all. Tip: freezed covered with plastic wrap TOUCHING the gelato beneath the container lid. Yummmm!

This recipe is transcendant. The flavor of the cantaloupe will knock you out. So refreshing for summer--use a ripe fruit.

While this wasn't as creamy as the cantaloupe gelato we had this summer in Italy, it was surprisingly good considering there is no milk or cream used. It had a very strong melon flavor and was very refreshing.

A easy recipe to follow and it also has a good flavor.
