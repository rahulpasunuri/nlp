So delicious! I halved the recipe, used russet potatoes and turnips from my garden. I added a lot fresh thyme to the pears because I love herbal flavors. Im sure sage would work well also. I used 1/2 the butter but added a splash of half& half and veggie broth to the potatoes.

This is so so good. Have made for guests many times and everyone asks for recipe.

Heavenly! Cut recipe down by 4 to make a smaller amount, but it was so good, I'll make more next time! Had freshly roasted and salted almonds with another part of the meal and they went really well.

I reviewed this from a couple of Thanksgivings ago. I was really craving this recipe tonight, but since turnips are not really in season, I made a batch with just yukons. Also had trouble finding the Bosc pears because it's the tail end of their season now, so bought a big bag of D'Anjou pears from costco. This combination worked just as well as the original. This is the absolute best mashed potato recipe. Just love it!

Great side dish with steaks. I cut the recipe down significantly since I only had about 2 lbs of potatoes. Also, I only pureed half of the pears. The rest of the roasted pears made an excellent dessert with ice cream!

I liked this dish very much, but my husband, who doesn't like "weird" textures, wasn't as happy about it. I only smashed the potatoes, rather than fully mashing them until smooth. He thinks if everything had been the same consistency (all smooth) he would have liked it. Also, I divided this down to make only 3-4 servings, for a weeknight dinner. I found 1 pear, 1 turnip, and 3 potatoes worked very nicely.

I made this recipe with sweet potatoes instead of the potato/turnip combination (the grocery store was out of turnips that day) and my roomate and I loved it! It's definitely a keeper. I love turnips, so next time I will have to try it without any substitutions.

My boyfriend and I just made these mashed potatoes. When we finished them, they tasted a little too sweet for our liking (we may have not added enough salt or gotten the proportions wrong), but we happened to have also made bacon. We added slices of bacon to the side and it was delicious! The saltiness of the bacon balanced out the sweetness of the potatoes very nicely. We will probably dice up the bacon and add it to the potatoes next time...If you want to try it with bacon, I would suggest not cooking the bacon until it is crispy. The juicy bacon was the best.

I tried this for Thanksgiving for the first time today and was crossing my fingers that it was good based on the other reviews here. Boy, did it pay off. I thought this was a delicious recipe. I was wary about the pear puree at first cause it sounded like such an unusual combination but it combined just perfectly with the taste of the turnips. I will definitely make this again and often.

This makes a lot of potatoes. I will cut recipe in half next year.

Talk about your perfect Thanksgiving side dish! It can be made ahead, is wonderfully flavorful and festive, and is pretty to look at. I added a bit of nutmeg to the pear Also, the recipe calls for way too much butter. I can't imagine how runny it would have beenif I had used 3 sticks. One stick worked beautifully. puree. Everyone had seconds. This will become a part of our traditional Thanksgiving menu.

WOW! Excellent dish. Wouldn't change a thing. It was big hit at Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it including my ten year old. It's a keeper!

This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I would do differently next time is reduce the butter by 1/2 cup; it was a bit runny. It did not ruin it. We had a 'Bon Appetit' party where everyone had to bring a recipe from the magazine. Everyone loved this.

I loved this dish. My husband made it, so I will have to try it again myself because it did not come out like the picture, it was a bit looser so it blended together more than shown. The taste was wonderful, it really was a nice way to serve mashed potatoes without being typical. I will definitely be making this again. Delicious!!

We had company from South Australia here for a few days. One of our meals, I gave her the option to choose our menu. She wanted an "American" dish. Since it is summer here, I chose grilled turkey legs with a honey mustard sauce, these potatoes, salad from our garden and cheesecake for dessert. We absolutely loved these potatoes. They were a perfect accompaniment for a dish without gravy. We will definately mark this one a keeper!

This was very good. Definitely a welcome change to regular mashed potatoes. The pears made a wonderful, interesting, slightly sweet twist...even my 3-year old liked them, and he won't eat plain mashed potatoes! The texture of the pear puree was also really neat. I was worried a little about serving this to a group that likes their standard mashed potatoes, turkey and green bean casserole every year, but it went over very well. I may always just add the turnips to my potatoes, it was delicious!!

This was sweet and savory. I would make more of the puree, everyone kept scooping it off the top.

A yummy and unusual potato dish. Was looking for a potato recipe to accompany a leg of lamb slowly cooked on the barbecue rotisserie (so no gravy) and this one was excellent. I halved the ingredients and really enjoyed the blend of flavours in this attractive dish. The pear puree was scrumptious!

Our whole family loved this dish for Thanksgiving! It was a bit time consuming to make, however, it was a nice diversion to the usual mashed potatoes, or mashed turnips, which I hate plain. Even I am now a turnips lover!! We ate these leftovers for days with Osso Buco and Roasted Cod. What a treat.

A lovely blend of flavours and a surprising way to perk up lowly mashed potatoes and turn them into something special. Yummy as they can be, aren't you just a little tired of garlic mashed potatoes?! I did make a few small changes and simplified the cooking method. Used rutabagas instead of turnips (personal taste preference); cooked potatoes/rutabagas in the same pot and mashed together (a good old potato masher worked very well); reduced the butter to a scant 2/3 cup (far too much butter as written!!!); added enough whole milk to give the mixture a smooth/creamy consistency; stirred in a generous amount of fresh ground pepper. Loved the roasted pears, but left the puree a little chunky and added a few dashes of nutmeg before folding into the potato mix. Garnished with a sprinkle of minced parsley, the resulting dish was alive with flavour and very attractive with swirls of contrasting colours/textures. My dinner guests raved about this dish and it was an excellent complement for a stuffed pork roast. Too bad the previous reviewer did not state why she disliked this. Please do not let those comments prevent you from trying this great side dish. This one is a true winner!

I thought this might be an different way to serve potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner and am so glad I tried it out first because we did not like it at all. I tried the recipe as shown with no changes or substitutions.
