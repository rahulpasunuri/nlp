This recipe is awesome. Instead of harissa, I use Thai kitchen roasted red chili paste. I also use boneless skinless chicken thighs. Instead of water I use chicken broth. I don;t rub the chicken just throw everything into the pan and cook for an hour until chicken is tender. Then sometimes I reduce the sauce more. I serve it with couscous and veggies. I am a personal chef and I have many clients who want this again and again.

This was just terrible. And I used fresh herbs and my homemade harissa. Not worth the effort. And I am someone who loves lots of herbs and spices in a dish. Will never make again. If you want a great recipe to use your harissa try the harissa marinated top sirloin tips at this site. (#359335)(and cook longer than they say.more like 1-1/2 hour)

Flavor is BORING! I added red pepper flakes just to give it interest. won't make it again

this is a great recipe. very easy and delicious. I love the cooking method. I used leg quarters, marinated overnight. to the sauce, after removing the chicken, I added a can of garbanzo, a handful of apricots, and thickened with some cornstarch. I subbed saffron for turmeric, since I thought I would get lost in the mariande. Served with rice. It made a lot of sauce.

It's not easy for me to please my husband with my cooking, but this recipe was the "key to his heart," as he told me at the end of dinner. I served it with plain couscous, but the sauce was perfect over it. Next time, I will add some raisins and slivered almonds to the couscous. I used sambal oelek, as I didn't have harissa on hand, and at the end, I forgot to put in the coriander, but it was perfectly delicious without it. I also would just leave the chicken in the sauce and serve it that way, as the broiler doesn't add to the chicken - we just remove the skin anyway.

Just served this for dinner to rave reviews. I followed the recipe pretty much to a T. I didn't have any cilantro on hand and added 1/4 cup of dried apricot to the sauce reduction (I like sweet and spicy meats). Comforting and delicious! I am definitely adding it to my favorites.

This was fantastic! Great flavors, and very easy to make. In addition to all the recipe called for, I took a few recommendations from other reviewers: added some dried chili powder to the other spices, a bay leaf to the onions, and cinnamon sticks to the reduction. Also, because a friend had made them for us, I added half a preserved lemon to the reduction, and some to the spice paste. The brand of harissa I found-- Pri Mevorah--turned out to be very tame, so I won't hesitate to add more next time (and I'm not a heat fiend). Re. the chicken, I bought 8 legs and 8 thighs instead of whole chickens, and had just enough spice rub to cover them all, so I think that was a good equivalent. I will make this again...soon!

I made this sans caraway, harissa & coriander (saving myself a trip to the market), and it was still delish. I may have addded too much water (I didn't measure 4 cups, I just made sure chicken almost covered), and thus may have diluted the seasoning because I did not taste the saffron like I expected. The color was still a nice orange. The meat had some residual blood inside, so next time I may boil, bake, broil. Basically, yummy dish with some EXCELLLENT gravy to boot! Wasn't expecting the sauce to turn out so well but I may become addicted...

This was FANTASTIC. Healthy and delicious. Comforting, but not with the fat and calories of comfort food. I bought Tunisian Harissa in France and was looking for an excuse to use it. I cut the amount of Harissa in half and would even consider quartering it - it's HOT! I lowered the heat by diluting with a little water and corn starch. I used chicken breasts and did not have the chicken in the broiler. Used couscous with toasted pine nuts and raisins. Will make this again and again.

Very tasty, with a rich, deep flavor. I had a hard time finding harissa until I visited Cost Plus/World Market (and picked up the last jar!). I've since seen other recipes that call for harissa, some as simple as spreading it on a roll as an addition to a gourmet sandwich.

After a couple of bites, my husband turned to me and said "this is 4 forks!!" And he was right! I made a couple of slight modifications: - I used a cut up whole chicken (discarding the back and the organs) - I made my own harissa - I rubbed the chicken with the paste and left it to marinate for 3 hours in the fridge. I made sure the get a good amount underneath the skin - Rather than 4 cups of water, I added a 14oz can of chicken broth - I replaced the cilantro with parsley Other than that, I followed the directions and we loved this meal. I made some quinoa to soak up all of the delicious sauce. We had A LOT of sauce left over and I'll use it with either some lamb or some pork later in the week. Yum!!

Wasnt so sure about it at first but came out really nice, especially if you make it the night before and it has time to come together. I added a cinnamon stick to the mix and about 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup kalamata olives when i reduced the sauce. Added a nice kick to it. Served with couscous and toasted pine nuts. Yum!

A delicious result, but where is the garlic, the preserved lemons and the big fat green olives - I added these elements to this excellent recipe and it made for a very authentic result. I do like the idea that the chicken can be simmered directly in the water (or stock - better!) without the need to brown at that stage. I cut the birds into 8 smallish pieces, and it was a quick dish to cook. Brown in a hot oven for a few minutes and it doesn't dry out.

Good, but I agree with the reviewer that all that great spice gets lost with that much water. I too will try it again and either bake or only use about an inch of water.

The spices in this are wonderful and I marinated it for a few hours before cooking. Unfortuantly all that great spice gets a bit lost once you add enough water to almost cover it. i think next time i'll bake or grill it instead or just add a small amount of chicken broth to braise it. Smells great!

My first feedback to this site! The other day I fancied something Moroccan, so went to Google and found this website and recipe. I cost me a bit to buy all the spices and herbs as I had none... but wanted to cook something nice for my girlfriend. It took a while to do the first time, and she was very hungry by the time I finally put it on the plate but my word did she like it! I reduced the sauce a bit much and I think it could benefit from maybe a few dried apricots and currants but when I tell you that I made it again this evening then you know how much I liked it! I served it with oven roasted peppers, corgette, onions and garlic and that set it off brilliantly. One of the best recipies I've ever cooked. Thank you!

this is a fabulous recipe! definitely adding it to my repertoire. i had harissa paste on me (in fact, i bought it on a whim, and was LOOKING for a recipe that included this ingredient when i came across this one). i skipped the browning under the broiler step--i left the chicken in the pot with the broth, and just boiled it down with the cover off. was just perfectly fine! and i served with a lemon herb couscous. my husband gave it a big thumbs up!

One of the best recipes I've tried on Epicurious (I've probably made about 20). I doubled the amount of paste made, used skinless chicken breasts, and the harissa recipe on the website (added more crushed pepper because recipe is pretty mild). Made sure to use all the paste left over and add to onions. Super flavorful.

Made this for my company's Holiday Party and was the most popular dish of the night! Even a self proclaimed "Food-snob-chicken-hater" loved this appetizer. It was especially great since it could be made ahead and required only baking on the day of the party.

I used purchased harissa, which was very HOT! The chicken was wonderful, but after reducing the cooking liquid to 3 cups, the sauce was hot enough to ignite the table napkins. Next time I'll use 1 tablespoon of purchased harissa instead of 2. Or I will use the harissa recipe on Epicurious, which is milder and very tasty.

This recipie is delicious! My husband requests it all the time ! We love it's flavor! I made it with saffron rice and prepared my own harissa using jarred bell peppers. Next time I want ti try the real bottled harissa... I heard its spicier!! Overall I love it!!

My husband and I love spicy flavorful foods and this really hits the spot! I make it with saffron rice and made my own harissa using jarred bell pepper, however it was that spicy so i'll have to try the real harissa! I love it ! My husband requests it all the time!!

I am an Indian and when i came across this recipe i thought it could be an excellent "chicken Curry" so i went ahead looking for Harissa but found none in the stores here I took help from the epicurious website and made my own Harissa as per the recipe indicated on the website, and this dish was a success. I however added a fresh bay leaf and that gave beautiful aroma while cooking the onions. Also adding chilli powder to the recipe helped me bind all the other spices together. Bottom line a definite recipe to entertain and do over and over again.

I thought the quantity was crazy - 2 chickens for four people. But my husband raved and ate half a chicken. Thanks for the tip on making the harissa at the same time as the sauce.

I have a husband who eats only boneless skinless chicken breast - and I modified this recipe to work with it. Substitute olive oil for butter, brown chicken breast for a few minutes brefore adding liquid, and reduce cooking time to 20 minutes. And he loved it!!

This is definitely a keeper. I do have some suggestions. I used smoked paprika rather than regular, which added a nice smoky depth to the sauce. I cut up one large whole chicken rather than using halves and used the backbones and wings to make a simple stock, (simmer them for 45 minutes with a peeled head of garlic and a cut up onion and strain) which I used in lieu of water, adding further depth. In lieu of butter I substituted 1/8 cup olive oil. We served this with steamed aged basmati rice and a Rioja and it was fabulous.

We are falling in love, and this was the first meal we made together. It turned out exactly as we'd hoped, and it wasn't too difficult to make. Our source says that the Tunisian variety of harissa is the best.

We love North African and Middle Eastern flavors, and this was an easy and tasty addition to the repertoire. Luckily, I had an unopened jar of Roasted Tomato Harissa from Lulu's. This worked nicely as a half-recipe using two cornish hens split in half. I reduced the braising time to 30 minutes for the smaller birds, using chicken stock instead of just plain water. I reduced the braising liquid to a highly concentrated sauce and then poured it over the cornish hens after their broiling phase. They kept nicely in a warm oven while we finished dinner prep - couscous with toasted pine nuts and raisins, and a green salad.

We had this dish last night and it turned out very good. However, I'd make a suggestion to ease preparation. If you can find prepared harissa, great! If not, don't go to the trouble (like I did) of making it yourself. The harissa recipe I used called for roasted red peppers, caraway seeds, garlic, olive oil, sugar, and dried red pepper. Instead, use one processor to prepare all the paste ingredients. Roast, peel, and chop 1-2 red peppers. Add to processer. Up the amounts of coriander, caraway, and garlic used in the paste, to your taste. Add all other ingredients. Add olive oil to make a paste. Then, proceed with recipe to "rub paste over chicken" and go from there. Served with couscous.

A great dish, but quite a bit of work (especially if you make your own harissa). My fiancee got me cooking about 1 year ago and this is my favorite recipe to date. It also makes the house smell wonderful.

I have never attempted to cook Moroccan food before much less anything more complicated than a grilled steak, but last night I made this with the Moroccan Spiced Vegetables and a Saffron Rice. WOW!!! This was so easy; very spicy, full of flavor and best of all everyone else loved it too. I would recommend this to anyone.

I make my own harissa and give it to friends, but I never really knew how to cook with it. When I saw the chef cook this on TV I thought I'd give it a try. I loved it! Mine was a bit spicy though, next time I'll use 1 tablespoon of harissa. In the reduction of the sauce, I added 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it a bit. It worked wonderfully. I'll teach my friends this one.

I don't cook often but tonight I switched with my wife. My experience has been that Moroccan food at restaurants was underwhelming (I expected something not Indian but exotic). This recipe was very good. I found that braising the chicken in the spices really resulted in a good result. The result was sufficiently spicy and along with cous-cous with peas and carrots was a perfect mixture. Finishing the chicken in oven was a good touch something we don't always do with other braised chicken dishes.

Couldn't locate harissa in my local stores, but undeterred, we just added extra cumin, coriander etc. We also added golden raisins, which we tossed in about 10 minutes before serving. Loved this recipe. Would like to make again with the elusive harissa.

I really enjoyed this one. I made my own harissa (and thanks very much to the person who earlier gave instructions), and thought that was a good way to make it as spicy as I wanted it. I used skinless chicken thighs, and didn't bother with the final bit of broiling it, and thought it was wonderful. Loads of flavor. I made it with the couscous with garbanzos and prunes also on this site, and thought they went really well together.

I really hate to ruin this recipe's perfect record, but I have to say that I can't quite understand the raves. I was so impressed by the earlier reviews that I made it (untested) for a dinner party and got a resounding "It was OK". It's not bad, but an awful lot of bother for what you get. I love Moroccan food and have made a number of Moroccan chicken recipes for guests over the years (the best is in Craig Claiborne's New York Times cookbook), but I'm afraid this is the only one I would not make again. Sorry!

This is incredible. I made it last night and the house still smells wonderful. I had my butcher halve two small chickens for me and remove the backbones. I broiled them as directed and I think that chicken with skin on is needed so that they don't dry out, yet will brown beautifully. I served the chicken with couscous in chicken stock and a pinch of cinnamon and Moroccan-style carrots (Epicurious). I made the harissa that is used in the Black Olives with Harissa (also Epicurious). Be sure to try this recipe. It's awe-inspiring.

AMAZING! This is one of the most delicious meals I've ever had! It is such a comfort feel to it without all the fat! You long for every bite and wish there was more when you are finished. I use chicken breasts instead of whole chickens. Ignore the broiling instructions if you do use only breasts. I use the full amount of harissa from epicurious' recipes. I also add one more red pepper. Just that extra zing. Everyone I've made this for asks for the recipes. Be sure to follow with Moroccan tea!

Very good. Suprised it was so easy to make. Served with couscous and should have made more for the wonderful sauce. There were NO leftovers. I left out the caraway seeds and thus did not need to use the food processor - everything made a paste quite nicely just with "smushing" with a spoon.

Homemade Harissa (since you already will have most of the components available to you from the recipe):Process/grind dried, hot, red chilies. Toast in a pan cumin seeds, coriander seeds and carraway seeds and put them into that same grinder. (these seeds should be in total about 1/4 the amount of the chili. With the processor going, add in some chopped garlic cloves and drizzle in olive oil until a medium thickness paste forms. You can keep theis in the fridge for a long time. Keep it in tupperware with a little oil drizzled over the top of the mix and then topped with saran wrap. If you do not have seeds, preground powders are perfectly acceptable. This is so much better and way cheaper than buying it and you can make the amount you want. I did not put exact amounts because I eye it and think about what would taste good. You should too. There is no wrong taste because all the bottled ones vary too.

This recipe looks like alot of work, but it's actually very easy, and the flavors are incredibly complex and delightful. The only real prep work is making the paste, which takes about 15 minutes. I prepare it ahead and rub it on the chicken pieces, then my husband sautes the onion and starts the braising process for me when he gets home from work. By the time I get home, I just set the chicken in the broiler and watch the liquid reduce. Easy and exotically delicious!

THIS RECIPE IS A DEFINITE KEEPER! THE PREPARATION WAS VERY SMOOTH. I USED A WHOLE CHICKEN IN CUT-UP PIECES, PLUS A COUPLE OF ADDED SKINLESS BREAST HALVES. THE RESULTING CHICKEN WAS FALL-OFF-THE-BONE TENDER AND THE SAUCE WAS VERY TASTY (SERVED OVER COUSCOUS).I SERVED IT WITH ADDITIONAL HARISSA, PICKELED CARROTS & CAULIFLOWER, STEAMED ZUCCHINI,PITA, ORANGE COOKIES AND MINT TEA TO FINISH.MY GUESTS ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE FLAVORS OF THIS MEAL. THE ONLY SUGGESTION I HAVE IS TO SKIP THE BROILING STAGE FOR SKINLESS PIECES...REALLY DRIED THEM OUT.

This dish is superb. I just made it for a small dinner party and people couldn't stop mmmmmm-ing over it. The only change I made was to use 2 whole chickens, cut into pieces instead of halves. I also had to make harissa (from a recipe on this site called olives in harissa, more or less) because there doesn't seem to be any in Hawaii. It was pretty easy. I served it with a simple couscous with just sauteed onions since the sauce is so fantastically flavorful. Definately try this one!

this dish is excellent. i suggest using skinless chicken thighs instead of the halved fryers. also, i tenderized the thighs with a fork and then let the mixture marinate into the meat for an hour in the fridge. i served this dish with rice, which was amazing with the braising liquid. i will make this dish at least a dozen times a year.
