An excellent recipe. I've made it now with both leg of lamb and leg of venison. It works beautifully for the latter, because the marinade and seasoning helps counter the toughness and strong flavoring of wild game. My only faint complaint would be that some of the odder measurements make it hard to double or triple for parties. Not a complaint, but a recommendation: save some of the cucumber pulp for a chunkier sauce.

Surely this is meant to say discard juice and reserve pulp?

easiest way to make your tsatziki sauce thick: use greek yogurt and press your grated or shredded cucumber in a potato ricer: gets rid of all the excess liquid, and leaves you with a very easy to mix in pulp.

Very good, quick and easy. However, I did make some changes to make it so. I used chicken and only marinated for half an hour to hour. I also didn't puree the cucumbers, just finely chopped and added to yogurt (didn't use greek) sauce just before serving. Nice contrast of flavors and with these simplifications took 30 mins to make. Enjoy!

I have continued to use the yogurt sauce recipe but I have adapted it further. I only puree one cucumber and strain the juice through cheesecloth. You can puree the raw garlic with the cucumber to get the flavors but not the sharp raw garlic taste in your mouth.I have found that straining the yogurt through cheesecloth did not make a big enough difference if you are on a time constraint, but at least pour off the clear juices from the top of the yogurt cup. Only mix in as much of the cucumber liquid as you need. I usually don't even use all the juice I get from the one cucumber. Season with lemon juice, salt, pepper and even ground cumin and coriander if it complements your dish.

I use chicken instead and it is a big hit. the sauce is thin but the flavor is very good. I have thought about using some juice and some pulp to make it thicker. Overall everyone I have served this to loves it!

Yeah, squeeze the water out of the cukes and use the pulp. I spent the money and bought bio-lamb, good food this!

This is the strangest sause recipy I have ever heard, just grate the cuccumber and then squeeze out the liquid, no salt needed, use the pulp. The yogurt sause should be very thick, let it site for about 2 hours or over night for a better taste.

I tried salting the cucumber (someone else suggested this to reduce sauce runniness), and after vigorously rinsing, the cucumber still tasted salty and horrible. Instead of salting, just cube the cucumber, and add it at the last min. to the sauce. It was great!

The lamb was excellent. I used fresh oregano and thyme from my garden in the marinade. The whole method described for making the sauce is a recipe for failure. I used chopped English cucumber which I heavily salted and left to drain for an hour. Then rinse them thoroughly. Put cucumber in a kitchen towel and aggressively squeeze out extra moisture. Add whole to yogurt sauce. That's what a Greek would do; and it won't be runny. If you use real Greek or Russian plain yogurt, you will have no worries.

I agree with the others, the sauce was too thin. To make up for this, I cooked some brown rice, mixed the sauce with that, and served it under the meat and veggies. Also, due to time and budget constraints, I made this with beef instead of lamb. It was still delicious!

I made only the Yogurt Sauce from this recipie. DELICIOUS! I used regular plain, low-fat yogurt and drained it through a cheesecloth and then followed the recipie from there. I could see it as a salad dressing too.

Tasted better than the Souvlakis I had in Greece. The sauce was easy and good, if a bit thinner then expected.
