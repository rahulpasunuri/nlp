This was wonderful. It was perfect with the maple syrup and sour cream accompaniments. will definitely make again

Pears were delicious but the cake was just awful. It was not sweet enough and almost salty. Cornmeal texture was very unpleasant. I think a lighter batter without any cornmeal would be a much better compliment to the pears.

Very easy and very delicious - this cake pleased all five members of my family plus a guest. It did not last one day!!

if you aren't used to the texture of johnnycake, you may find it not what you were expecting...but it's supposed to have a drier, more texture-y consistency! great with the sour cream, and the combo of pear and maple was unexpected. will make again

Very disappointing. I love upsidedown cakes, pears and cornmeal, but this was surprisingly dry and had quite an unpleasant taste.
