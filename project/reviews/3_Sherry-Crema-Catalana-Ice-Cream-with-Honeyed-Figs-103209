The taste of this is amazing, unfortunately I followed the advice of the poster who suggested to cut the butter fat. After substituting half the cream with milk, the flavor was great but the ice cream came out too icy. The taste is worth a second shot though, where I plan to follow the recipe more closely.

I plan to make this for a party this weekend, but am unfamiliar with the nuances of different sherries. Does anyone know if the Amontillado can be replaced by a cream sherry?

This is really tasty, especially the figs. It was sweet and tart at the same time, and the sherry added a lot of complexity. Our ice cream came out a little too icy, with odd texture, but that's more likely our inexperience with our ice cream maker than the recipe. Great flavor combinations.

I liked this recipe, but not enough to make it again. I had Amontillado sherry on hand and thought it would be a nice opportunity to use it. I have other ice cream desserts that I prefer to this.

This was outstanding and universally adored. One note: the alcohol inhibits freezing, so allow for plenty of time in the freezer - at least overnight.

A quick update from my last review. The second time I made the ice cream I made the recipe x 1.5 (used 11 egg yolks) and it fit perfectly in an 8-cup loaf pan lined with plastic wrap. Sliced nicely and easily served 10. Made the sauce recipe as written and it was more than enough. Everyone loved it!

Excellent. Followed the recipe exactly and at first it appeared it might be either too heavy/eggy tasting. After a few days in the freezer I served it last night with the sauce (had to sub fresh strawberries for figs) and it was wonderful. Every guest complimented on the flavor of both the ice cream and the sauce. They work very well together. I will be making again for a Spanish themed dinner party this weekend and plan to offer spiced coffee as well (liqueur 43). Thanks previous reviewer!

Delicious! I made this for a Spanish themed dinner party and got raves all around. Served it with "Spanish" coffee - spiced coffee with 43 liqueur and whipped cream.

the ice cream is too heavy, it's like eating frozen butter. i would recommend using half milk and half "half & half" to cut the butterfat. (that sounded confusing!!) the sauce really tasty, the intense flavor of the sherry blends very well with the sweetness of the figs and the acidity of the OJ.

I like Crema Catalana a lot because it's the most famous dessert in my country, Catalonia. It is sweet and delicious. I recommend you to try to do it, you'll see, you won't be deceived.
