Just another Pecan pie recipe

Rating: 0
Also used a different pie crust recipe. Overall, it turned out well. The only problem was that there wasn't enough filling--when I make it this Thanksgiving I will double the filling.

Rating: 4
Made this for my man, a boy from Georgia, who absolutely was in heaven over it. I made a different crust but otherwise followed the recipe precisely, though added more pecans. Next time I'll probably increase the wet ingredients to have more filling and I'll cut the baking time further (mine was done in just under and hour anyway, but will cut it to 50 minutes or so. But this one is a keeper, for sure - great result and really easy to make.

I've tried this twice in two weeks- was my very first pecan pie ever. Turned out well. It was really helpful to read everyone else's comments. I used pillsbury dough crust instead of the recipe crust. I toasted my pecans for 2 minutes prior to adding to mix and on top for decoration. I heeded the warnings about the cooking time. I think 45 minutes is best. I got rave reviews on the pie.

Did not use this crust recipe, so this is really a comment only on the filling. Turned out very well, quite traditional, and pleased the pickiest of the pecan pie fans in the house. Was the first dessert to go on Thanksgiving Day.

Very delicious, but there wasn't a lot of filling. We ended up putting extra pecans on the top, which were good, but the whole thing was too nutty (i.e. not enough filler).

The pie filling is fine but the crust is terrible. There are others on the site that are better.

Yum. A go-to recipe for classic pecan pie. I used more pecans (probably about 2 cups total) becuase I arranged the halves in concentric circles around the top. Made for a very pretty presentation.

Rating: 4
I made mine in a tart pan because I like the look...it looked fabulous, it tasted fabulous and held its shape when cut. This was my first attempt and my mother who has been making pecan pies for 65 years gave it 4 forks.

Yikes - I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and caution anyone thinking of making this for the holidays! I don't know if it's because the filling isn't cooked on the stove first or what, but this pie was terrible! I have made many different recipes for pecan pie and didn't know it was possible to botch one. This version is lumpy and not rich and has way too many nuts. Yuck - what a disappointment!

Rating: 1
This recipe was quite disappointing. The interior of the pie remained runny and unset while the crust burnt. The taste was ok, but consistency of the filling was poor.

Easy to make and delicious, but very rich.

I made this pie with a homemade crusts and with store bought crusts, and both were delicious! Every time I make this pie I get rave reviews, even from people who don't eat a lot of nuts! This recipe couldn't be easier or more delicious.

This is sooo yummy. I used my own pastry dough recipe, a 10 inch pie plate and doubled the filling recipe. I also toasted the pecans and reserved enough pecan halves to decorate the top of the pie. It is perfect with a dollup of whip cream. Enjoy.

I am baking impaired and this is a great recipe and so easy. I usually find pecan pie to be very rich and sweet, but this is just right. I use frozen pie crusts and in my oven takes about 15 mins more than recommended baking time.

another year...another success. pie plate was licked clean even with store-bought crust. the most delicious pecan pie i have ever eaten.

Loved it. My hostess grabbed the last piece for herself (I had my eye on it too but it was OK). And it was easy. The hardest part was getting the crust to be the right shape.

Rating: 4
My husband just ate two pieces. Normally, he would pass on pecan pie. I used my own pie crust recipe, added 1/4 tsp. salt to filling and cooked it for one hour. It is not super over sweet like other recipes I have tried. I like to use chopped pecans because they do not sink down into the filling when cutting a slice. Garnishing with several whole pecans brings it up a notch.

Rating: 3
The only problem I had was with the crust. It wouldn't stay together when transferring from table to pan. I had to flatten the dough inside the pan instead. But when cooked, it was great.

Rating: 4
This is an awesome pie and couldn't be easier to make. I'm adding it to my collection as the official pecan pie. I used a full cup of chopped pecans in the filling, and, instead of sprinkling chopped nuts on top, I arranged pecan halves in a circular pattern that covered the top. This makes it look a little prettier. It's great either way.

Rating: 1
I followed this recipe exactly, to the letter and the pie came out burnt. Yes, blackened pecans on the top. I will try it again with some of the suggested adaptations by the reviewers but in my opinion pecans, butter, sugar, etc. are too valuable to waste. The recipe should be changed to state an appropriate baking time.

Rating: 3
I have made this pie several times now, and it is DELICIOUS! It has become a #1 request among families and friends...suggest adding a dash of bourbon, and if there's anyone that has a chocolate-tooth, melt some semi-sweet chocoate, and drizzle on top! Once the chocolate reaches room temperature, it's hardens, and gives a little bit of chocolate taste, without overpowering the flavor of the pie...YUM!

Rating: 2
Very good flavor, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the texture is a bit odd, perhaps gelatinous...? I substituted half of the corn syrup for Lyle's golden syrup whic I thnk improved the taste.

Rating: 3
This was my first pecan pie. It came out very well, but I think I should have added the bourbon that was recommended by some of the others. I think it would have enhanced the flavor. I used a store bought frozen crust to save time.

I used the Buttermilk pie crust which was great. I'm not a pecan pie fan, but this tasted good to me. I added 50% to the pie filling and cooked for 1 hour. The filling was the perfect amount. My boyfriend loves pecan pie and he thought this was an excellent pie. Trader Joe's is reasonable on the pecans.

Rating: 4
Excellent pie; only complaint was that it did not fill the pie pan completely, leaving naked pastry at the top.

Rating: 4
This pie earned me the ultimate compliment from my picky husband: "It's better than my mom's." Pretty impressive! I used the Flaky Pie Crust recipe from Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything (the best pie crust ever, in my opinion). I used halved pecans instead of chopped and baked the pie for one hour instead of an hour fifteen--it was fabulous, and I don't even like pecan pie!

Rating: 4
This pie was very easy to make and tasted good, but when I ate another piece the following day, it really tasted delicious. My advice: make it one day in advance for all the flavors to come out. Great recipe!

I absolutely love the recipe...especially the crust! However, maybe my oven is off because it was overbaked at 1 hr and 15 min.

Loved this recipe as did my guests! I couldn't believe how easy it was to whip up on busy Thanksgiving Sunday. My father who loves pecan pie thought it was the best he'd had, ever!!!

I used my favourite "Flour Paste Pie Crust" recipe from the Joy Of Cooking (the recipe makes enough for two crusts, so roll out and freeze the 2nd crust) and then I made the pie just as written, and everyone said that it was the best Pecan Pie ever... and I must admit, I even impressed myself! Absolutely marvelous!

Rating: 4
This was one of the best pecan pies I have ever tasted! Everyone raved! I used store-bought mini tart crusts so I had pecan pie tartlets! HUGE hit! I definitely recommend this recipe.

Rating: 3
There are certainly many wonderful reviews of this, so I anticipated greatness. Following others' suggestions, I added a little whiskey (no bourbon on hand). I also threw in a dash of cinnamon and toasted the pecans beforehand (I highly recommend doing the latter). However tasty the pie came out, I wasn't satisfied with the texture of the filling. It was gellishly, mildly clumpy, for lack of a better description. Other pie recipes vary only slightly, and I might try another next time just to compare. Very tasty, anyway.

Rating: 4
Excellent Pecan Pie. I've made this pie for several years now and it always turns out wonderfully. I've even made this with ready-made crust when time and energy have been short and that's turned out well too. I usually chop a larger amount of the pecans, leaving fewer large pieces that can "stick out" and get burned.

Rating: 4
This was great my cooking helper accidentally chopped most of the pecans fine so I used them anyway and it was the best pie anyone had ever eaten

Rating: 4
delicious. think of a good piece of pecan pie, and this is what you get. it's a keeper recipe. i used all butter, no shortening. i also made 150% of the filling called for because at first it wasn't enough filling to fill the crust.

Rating: 4
Made the recipe with my own crust, for Thxgiving this year. Added about 2 T of Glenlivet just for fun, and it gave the pie the most *wonderful* undertone of flavor- I will always add Scotch from now on. Next time I'll try toasting the pecans beforehand.

Rating: 4
i made this pie for turkey day. after i had everything mixed i came back to make sure i was suppose to use white sugar and not brown. i noticed a couple of one fork reviews, and got quite worried. so i made some revisions. use an extra 1/4 c. of corn syrup, and 2 T. of grand marnier (or bourbon, whiskey, apple brandy etc . . . ) and 1/4 t. salt. i reduced the baking time to 55 minutes at 350 half the time and down to 325 the other half. i think even without the modifications, you need to reduce the baking time or the pie will be dry. it came out great and the grand marnier gives it a nice subtle something extra!

Rating: 4
i see above some poor reviews for this recipe. I have used it for years with certain modifications that may be helpful to others. For the crust I add in 1/2 cup sugar instead, and I don't use any shortening. Instead I use one whole stick of butter. The crust tastes buttery, and is not salty. I also try to use a pie pan that is not too deep. It really is a great pie with these modifications.

Rating: 4
THE PIE WAS A BIT CUMBERSOME, MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY, BUT NONE THE LESS AFTER IT WAS DONE AND GAVE IT TO MY FRIENDS, THEY LOVED IT ALOT. THE ONLY THING I REGRET IS THAT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ME TO ENJOY A SECOND TIME WITH AN ICE COLD GLASS OF OBERWIESS MILK AND I MEAN ICE COLD

My wife loves pecan pie that is the reason that I made it. But after having this particular pie recipie she had me throw it away. The crust was to saltyand thae filling was not creamy as it should be. The pie came out dry and hard. Granted that pecan pie is not one that I particulary like I've had better.

Rating: 1
I am a great, reknowned chef (in my family)and have made many of the recipes found on this site always with success. After making this one I can't disagree more with everyone who gives this FOUR forks. The crust is too salty, perhaps 1/8 t. would be better and it definately needs more corn syrup. An hour to cook this one is way too long. It is DRY DRY DRY-it is supposed to be pie not cake. By the by, listen up people, If your family or friends compliment this pie they are just being polite...It STINKS

Rating: 4
This is a great pecan pie, I will definitely make this again and this will go into my favorite recipe file! I used Pillsbury crust, but instead of using one crust, I rolled both together to create a much flakier crust--saved me the time in making my own crust! A definite 4-fork recipe!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I used only about 1/3 cup of crushed pecans. Advice to bake for 1 hr was correct. Also "perked up" the recipe by adding a splash of cognac.

This recipe gets rave reviews from guests every time. Cut back on corn syrup and sugar, increased pecans and used 1 t. almond extract instead of vanilla--gives it a marzipan taste. Also used Pillsbury foldover crust. Baked one hour. Fantastic!!!!

This is absolutely the best pecan pie that I have ever eaten. The filling is lovely and gooey, not eggy and sort of curdled like other recipes I have had. Like other reviewers, I cooked mine less time--probably about 1 hour.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I decreased the pecans to one and a half cups and didn't bother with whole pecans for the top - it didn't need it. My only problem was that I used a 9" deep dish pie shell (frozen-it worked great) and there wasn't quite enough filling. Still, it tasted fabulous.

Rating: 4
I found this recipe absolutely delicious and I normally don't like pecan pie. I needed a second dessert for Thanksgiving but wanted something really American for our German friends to enjoy. This was definitely it- they all loved it. (Although I had to go to quite a few places until I found both pecans and corn syrup!) I cut back on the sugar and corn syrup- good advice from previous posters. I also used my old standby recipe for the crust from the Southern Living cookbook.

this was a huge hit at thanksgiving! everyone said it was the best pecan pie they had ever had. that said, i baked it for the full hour and 15 minutes, and it would have been better with a shorter cooking time. i made the crust with all butter instead of shortning, and that worked well.

Can't believe I made a pie that tasted this good! This recipe made me seem like a pro. Only complaint is, the pie only needed to bake in my oven for about 40 min. Whoever said 75 min. owes me two crusts and a dozern eggs.

Crust is too short, but the filling is excellent! Flavorful without being too sweet. Would definitely make a different crust, though...

Awesome PIE! Only thing we didnt like was it had way too many pecans for our liking, even though I only used 1 1/2 cups. Next time, will try it with only 1 cup or increase the other filling ingredients.

I have made a pecan pie with my mom every Thanksgiving for years, always in search of the perfect pie. This one was unquestionably the best... turns out the other recipes called for too much corn syrup, explaining why our pies never seemed to set. This recipe will give you the perfect pecan pie!

I printed this recipe out for my sister to make for Thanksgiving. She had never made a pecan pie before and it turned out great. It was quite tasty and a good marriage of pecans and other interior ingredients. Often times, it seems, pecan pies have pecans on top and the "gel" layer below but this was all combined beautifully. I would make it again and I think my sister would too. Also, the crust was nice. It was thick and good almost had the texture of having nuts in it.

This recipe was so straight forward and simple anyone could make it...and the end result was pure decadence. What more could you ask for in a recipe?! Everyone gobble, gobble, gobbled it up at Thanksgiving. I didn't even bother making the pie crust from scratch and it was still out of this world. Definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe for the past 2 years for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other occasions. Everyone always begs me for the recipe!!! I do, however, use a different crust recipe. Also, watch out for the cooking time as the pecans on top may burn. But once you fix those 2 tiny glitches...you will love it!!

Rating: 4
I had read the comments here from people who had had trouble working with the crust, but I went ahead and made the crust anyway. What a disaster! I was piecing it together in the pie plate. I'd go with a different crust recipe. I'll trust that the pie filling is as good as the raves below....I made two of these for charity, so I won't be tasting it this time around.

Turned out great! I don't even like pecan pie usually but decided to use up some Georgia pecans I got from my mother-in-law. I used both chopped and whole pecans. I'll make sure to cover the entire top next time though because the sugar gets too dark otherwise. Also, I had a hard time rolling out the dough; it was too fragile. I pressed some of it into the pan and the crust turned out tender and perfect anyway.

We really loved this dish. It was my first time making a pecan pie, and I found it amazingly simple. The only problem I had was that the top started to get too brown before the very center of the pie had completely set and before the recommended cooking time was up. (About an hour of cooking time) I just pulled it out then and it turned out fine. In the future I might cover the top with foil part way through.

Best recipe I've come across - and I've tried many. Made my own crust using a regular pan and the filling was enough. Increased the amount of pecans to 2 cups and just broke them in half with fingers. I also mixed ALL of the pecans into the filling mixture before pouring into the shell. Really great recipe!

Rating: 3
Good pie, and I also added more pecans. Used a store bought crust, which I pre-baked. The only problem I had was when I cut into it, the filling seemed "globby" and not uniformly gooey the way pecan pie filling is supposed to be. It looked like the butter was separating from the rest of the filling too. (And yes, I did let it cool for 2 hours.) Still tasted good, and it firmed up a bit more the next day.

This is the first recipe for Pecan Pie I try and it's definitely a keeper. I did some modifications. I mixed in brown sugar with the white sugar and also mixed in some maple syrup with the corn syrup...the results were fantastic! The brown sugar & maple syrup gave it extra flavour and a nice color. I also topped it with whole pecans (rather than chopped) and it made a great presentation. The crust didn't turn out so well so I used frozen pie crust the next time which worked for me.

This was my first pecan pie, & I was amazed at how easy it was. I experimented a little & made one in a frozen pie crust & one using the recipe, & I really couldn't tell much difference so I will cheat from now on. My husband loved it also. I thought there was adequate filling in the recipe, though.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving for the first time this year. I have to say that the sweetness was absolutely perfect. I had two problems: My first problem was that there didn't seem to be quite enough filling..So I compensated by adding more pecans. That was a bad idea..the pecans sank, and caused the pie to be too nutty. Otherwise, it's an A+. Now that I know what not to do, I'll certainly make it again.

I made this recipe for my father, who lived in Louisiana while my grandfather was stationed at Fort Polk. He's very particular about his desserts and he absoulutely loved this recipe! So much so he had me give the recipe to my stepmother! He commented that most pecan pies are too sweet and this one reminded him of the pecan pies "down South".
