I made this as written, simply because by some fluke I had all the ingredients on hand. I thought it was ok, just ok. Nothing special. The basil turned dark and its flavor was lost; I would skip it next time. Actually, I would probably skip the corn too and instead add some toasted nuts and maybe some goat cheese to the finished bacon/squash/spinach dish - that sounds much better to me than this recipe.

I am surprised this recipe had so many glowing reviews. I was excited to have a full bodied use for butternut squash that utilized items I already had. I was epecting something really flavorful, but ended up with a pretty blah dish where everything just tasted like everything else. It was pleasant. I could get my 3 year old to eat it. But it was not a stand-out dish.

I make this dish every Christmas. The bacon gives the vegetables a really yummy flavor that pulls the dish together. It's a very colorful and pretty dish too. I always make it exactly as the recipe says. Every ingredient is important to the final product.

This dish was a huge success. I made it exactly as described and will do so again and again.

I rarely make a new dish twice; dinner is either something entirely new or on a very short list of weeknight favorites. This recipe is one of those few that is so good it's made it to the short list! Mostly because bacon is my husband's favorite vegetable. The bacon makes this warm vegetable dish so comforting and tasty. It is quite a large recipe (perfect for pot-luck side dishes) and we usually eat it for a main dish with several days worth of leftovers. Beautiful colors, too.

I made this for Thanksgiving using sage instead of basil. It turned out well, very tasty with good comments from everyone. I would like to try it with basil next time for a fresher taste, sage was nice with the bacon for a rich Thanksgiving dish.

I have made this several times and it's always good. Sometimes I'll use red potatoes instead of squash, and sometimes I substitute turkey bacon then add olive oil (and a little extra salt). It ends just as good!

Again, easy, delicious and travels well - but I use sage instead of basil. Leftovers make a great chowder - just add milk, heat, and season with salt and pepper.

I brougth this to Thanksgiving dinner, everyone raved. I thought it was just ok. I used pre-cut and peeled butternut squash and was afraid the smallish cubes would disintegrate when I stirred everything together. So I roasted the squash cubes and onions in the oven with the grease from cooking the bacon. The roasting gave both a beautiful color and a fuller flavor. Doubled the spinach as well. Not sure what the basil did to the dish, I didn't taste it at all.

Delicious. I did make a few changes so take my review with a grain of salt although I don't believe my changes affected the overall integrity of the dish. The most major is that I had to leave out the spinach. I wasn't happy about that, but with the recent spinach issues, I can't buy fresh and, well, I just can't EVER buy frozen... The other changes are that I used acorn squash instead of butternut (personal preference), and after tasting it, I added quite a lot more salt, and about a tablespoon of brown sugar to enhance the sweetness of the squash. I do have to say, I've never had to peel acorn squash before and WOW is that a pain!!! Worth it though.

This dish is a standard fall recipe at our house. I hate to review a recipe and then change the ingredients, BUT in this case because it is fall and basil is on the way out, we have made it with fresh sage. This is a perfect complement to the squash, bacon and corn. Also agree that swiss chard goes well. As far as waiting 15 - 20 minutes for the squash to cook, just cut the pieces a little smaller, pour a glass of wine, then sit down and enjoy the aromas. A fresh butternut squash should not be tough. This is a great dish, perfect for fall.

I made this (followed the recipe exactly) for our Christmas dinner and it was a hands-down favorite. Had several requests for the recipe...

Dang, this is good. I used Swiss chard in place of the spinach. It just seems more substantial for this dish. Next time I'll use smoked ham in place of the bacon.

This was amazing and everyone loved it! One of the reviewers said they purchased pre-cut squash but I couldn't find it at any of my local stores. Cooking the squash and cutting it up was the most time-consuming part. I also added some nutmeg and cinnamin at the end and my sister-in-law suggested that some brown sugar would be good too. I will make it again soon.

Very good. There are not many winter vegetable dishes after the potatoes and yams and if you're not a green bean fan well... I made this twice over Christmas weekend with and without the bacon for our vegetarian guests; everyone had seconds. Added some allspice as another reviewer suggested which added a nice dimension. Do not underestimate the amount of time for the prep work; I spent 25 minutes on the butternut squash alone. Other than this is was easy to prepare. Would make again for a holiday dinner.

Have made this a few times and just love it! Great recipe for those who don't really like squash (like me.) Can't go wrong when you add bacon :-)

A huge hit! I just made this dish for a group of ten, including in-laws from China. I was worried about picking a menu that would appeal to everyone. This dish was the star of the dinner - distinctly American in character, yet very friendly to the Asian palate. I made two changes to the recipe - added a dollop of balsamic vinegar to the simmering sauce, and then added a garnish of toasted pine nuts at the end. Delicious!

This was good. I love all of these healthy ingredients BUT we thought it was too onion-y so I'll cut back on that next time. Also, I made it without bacon in the interest of health consiousness . I'm guessing that the bacon would bring it up to 3 forks but I'm trying to be good...

A great holiday side dish...this was one of the big holiday treats this year. It's very simple and the flavors are so good together!!! i will make this one again for years to come. I used the pre-cut squash and pre-washed spinach to make this a snap to cook.

This was great! Simple, elegant, and very tasty. Be careful not to overcook the squash or else it'll get mushy and won't look as nice (but if you like your squash mushy, hey, go ahead!).

I first made this dish for Thanksgiving 1999 when my family was coming to Chicago for the holiday. Since then, it is a staple at every Thanksgiving & Christmas meal we've had. When I fly home to GA next week I've already been asked to make it. It's also great to take to potluck dinners.

Delicious and beautiful! I make this dish often in the fall, though I prefer to use delicata squash. The twist I put on the recipe is to carmelize the onions adding just a splash of balsamic vinegar right at the end, remove them from the pan and add them back in at the end with the corn and spinach. Also, I hate to mask the delicate flavors of the fresh veggies with so much bacon so I use about half of what the recipe calls for. When serving to guests, I top it off with freshly roasted pumkin seeds - their nutty flavor and crunch adds another dimension to the dish. I like another reviewer's idea to add feta - I'll try some crumbles on top next time.

Rating: 3
This recipe has the potential to be great. I used chopped frozen spinach (cuz that's all I had), canned corn (borrowed) and didn't have fresh basil. Next time I'll make it with everything called for. I was looking for a sharpness in flavor, which it lacked, so maybe I'll add a little Feta cheese next time. Still, it was very tasty.

Due to dietary restrictions, I left out the bacon and used a little olive oil. I cooked the squash about 25 minutes total. It was excellent.

This dish will be added to my Thanksgiving menu!Based on previous comments I went light on the onion, and liked the balance. Next time I'll add a little more bacon.

I used fresh corn off the cob and a bag of fresh spinach. My proportions were probably off -- too much onion, not enough bacon. Picky eaters ate it all, but somehow it didn't quite gel flavorwise for me. It was surprisingly moist though. Squash too way more time to cook -- I had to cover the pan for almost ten minutes to get it cooked.

After reading the reviews and thinking about it, I decided the spinach had probably been added more for color than taste. So, I left it out. Most stores now carry the precut/prepeeled butternut squash so I went with that rather than take the time to prep my own (cut down considerably on the prep time). Instead of the recommended 2.5 lbs of squash, I made it an even three to make up for the volume that would have been spinach. I used an entire 1 lb package of thick sliced apple wood smoked bacon and filtered the grease through a paper cone filter after it had cooled a little. I replaced the onions with about 8 shallots, peeled and quartered. Then, rather than steam or boil the squash, I roasted it for 30-45 minutes (shaking the pan every 15 minutes) in a 425 degree oven with the shallots, thyme, salt, pepper, 2 Tablespoons of the clarified bacon grease and 2 Tblspoons olive oil. When taking the squash out of the roasting pan and mixing it with the corn, bacon, etc. I had to a pretty delicate touch. The roasted squash was very soft and would lose it's body very easily unless handled carefully. All in all it turned out to be an incredibly satisfying dish. It left my kitchen smelling faintly of curry (even though I didn't use any!)

I tested out this dish in anticipation of Thanksgiving. I cut the squash into large pieces and boiled it (skin on) for 7-10 minutes before removing it and peeling the skin (the skin is really soft and easy to remove after boiling). Even with this additional cooking time for the squash, the cooking time for the dish as a whole is much longer than the recipe suggests. At first I thought it was going to be too dry, but the spinach and corn add a little liquid and help mold the flavors together. All in all, a pretty delicious dish. Definitely worth trying...I think it will be a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

I first made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2000 - everyone at the dinner requested a copy of it. Now I wouldn't do Thanksgiving dinner without it! It is WONDERFUL re-heated - you can make it ahead and warm it in the oven (which I recommend when doing a huge dinner) OR it is an excellent one-dish dinner! Try it you'll LOVE it!

My husband and I really liked this dish. It's a new and interesting way to use the abundance of winter squash. I did not have freah basil on hand, but I didn't miss it. My recommendation for peeling the squash is to use an Oxo Good Grips peeler. It made it much easier than a regular peeler and left all the squash meat in tact, although it still took a while. Squash needed a little longer to cook than time stated. If you don't like the texture of frozen corn, I would recommend using canned Green Giant Niblets; they have a good crunch.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. My only complaint is that the squash is such a bear to peel. It works really well as a breakfast dish too - just put a poached egg on top of a serving; it's delicious.

I think this dish would be more appealing in the summer, when fresh corn is available... The basil and bacon didn't blend very well--it turned into a cacophony of flavors.

i have been making thanksgiving for my family and my friends who can't make it home for the holidays the past few years and i have to say this one is always a HUGE hit, even with my vegetarian friends! before non-meat 'meat' products became so popular, i started off substituting good ol' BAC-O-BITS in place of the bacon. i added some butter so it would have a little bit of the fat texture and it turned out grand. i was pretty nervous about doing this sort of swap the first time--but it turned out great.

I would lean toward a four fork rating on this recipe. I have made it several times and everyone has always raved about it. Frankly, those who did not rate it high may have not had the best ingredients. My butternut squash has alwys been very good and I have used peppered bacon on at least one occasion. This dish gets even the most reticent vegetable eaters to eat something good for them (of course, this discounts the use of the bacon, but it really makes it good). it is a great dish. pt

This dish was simply boring, It didn't seem to have any flavor at all. I really can't belive people are giving this 4 forks. Remember gang, 4 forks is as high as it goes! 4 forks means it is up there with your very favorite recipes. It did have a nice presentation though!

I have made this dish several times and it has always been a hit. I always use low-fat bacon, and many times I make it the day ahead and just heat it up in the microwave before serving. This dish goes really well with the garlic mashed potatoes (Bon-apetit Nov.98) and turkey or beef tenderloin.

This dish was not only incredibly good tasting-it was quite colorful as well. I highly recommend this. The squash was a bit difficult to peel-but well worth the effort.

This is one of those many 3.5 recipes I find on Epicurious. I nuked the squash for a few minutes then dumped it into my big electric wok. That seemed to solve the problem another cook encountered with the squash taking a bit long to cook. I love these interesting and complex veggie recipes--you can serve them with grilled or roasted meat, warm bread and a salad and voila!--a meal fit for company.

When I took the turkey out of the oven on Thanksgiving, I realized I had not done the prep work for this dish. I chopped like a fiend and got it finished by the time the turkey was carved! It was terrific. This will be a favorite. I'm taking it to a pot luck dinner tomorrow.

Wonderful! I will be making these again. I did add some garlic though! After making it and eating I relized I forgot to put in the basil, but I think that the vegetables speak for themselves in this one. It looks beautiful on the plate too.
