This is an interesting recipe: sort of like Trout Piccata (without slicing the meat). You can substitute thyme for the tarragon, shallot for the green onion, and olive oil for the butter: it tastes great. Thanks, Bon Appetit.

From the first time in 2001 that I made this dish, it is still my husband's favorite. I have never changed a thing and he loves it. You know? I do too.

They had some nice trout fillets at the fish market, so I built my dinner around them. I made with a few small changes: I used rosemary instead of tarragon and replaced the green onions with half shallots and half green onions. And I rinsed the capers before using; this makes the taste less assertive. All in all, a great recipe!

The second time I made this,I drained off ALL of the bacon grease and used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. It is lighter and heart-healthier but retains the smokey tang! I chose rosemary over tarragon and added only half the capers. Superb!

Very good and easy. I would add fewer capers next time.

Outstanding! Fantastic! Delicious! Used two trout filets--toatal weight=1.25 lbs. Do not over-cook! two minutes per side is perfect. Pour HOT sauce over trout--will finish cooking! Husband LOVED this. Made for a Valentine's Day Dinner with oven- roasted Brusselsprouts,shallots,Baby Yukons&bacon. Super meal! Rich, but not an every-day meal.

It's a keeper. My family loved it. Easy to make, I followed the recipe and the trout was delicious.

This was delicious, despite the fact I don't know how to bone a trout. I cut back on the bacon fat & butter.

How can you go wrong with bacon and butter? Loved it! Grocery store didn't have tarragon so just left it out. Capers are a nice contrast with the butter and bacon. A definite keeper for me.

This was great! I had some doubts about the combination of ingredients, but it was truly tasty! My husband loved it, and he's not a big fan of fish. Also, I made most of this recipe while a) on the phone and b) accidentally drunk, and I STILL didn't mess it up--so it's a pretty easy dish!

This has become a family favorite. We make it again and again. It's delicious. I forgot this was where I'd gotten it from. The sauce is a nicely smokey and piquant - just what trout needs. Yum.

Fabulous. Heart attack on a plate, but fabulous. Made exactly as directed, and will certainly make it again.

I have to agree with an earlier review... I was reluctant to try the recipe because of the apparent mismatch of ingredients. But I, too, was blown away by the final dish. I had to improvise a bit as I didn't have any capers or tarragon at hand. I bumped up the amount of lemon juice and substituted a small amount of rosemary for the tarragon. The bacon, trout and lemon nicely balance each other out.Definitely a recipe worth repeating.

Followed the recipe precisely (but doubled it) and found even with 12 slices of bacon that I didn't get even a half teaspoon of bacon drippings. My children found the sauce a bit too sour and picked out all the capers. The fish itself was very nice and moist.

I must admit I was a bit skeptical about this recipe. The combination of flavors in the sauce seemed a bit mismatched. Wow, was I wrong. I made this last night and it was out of this world! The flavors all meld deliciously with the trout. To those reviewers who have issues with the fat content... Lighten up! (so to speak).

We have our own 1-4 rating system. My husband won't give anything a 4. He'll say it loves a recipe and then say, "Oh, 3.25." Nothing has ever gotten above a 3.75 from him, except this. He loved it. "4," he said. Good stuff. I guess I'll have to make it again.

3+ forks. I made this recently when I had all the ingredients on hand. It was excellent. I used an extra thick cut smoked bacon. I made a couple of adjustments though. I only had a half cup of green oinions and used 3 tbls of Smart Balance rather than butter. I would make this for company the same way, although I would use real butter as I don't mind clogging guest's arteries in the quest for great taste.

I used rainbow troutwhich were huge so I had to pan fry the fish one at a time. The sauce was awesome. Between the capers/lemon and taragon the aroma was fantastic.

We really enjoyed this dish-quite lively taste. I did not have fresh tarragon so I used fresh cilantro. Quite nice! Next time I would serve this with mashed potato rosettes with broiled crust.

Really good but I used parsley instead of tarragon. I've made this dish several times and get great reviews every time.

Would use less butter the second time but very tasty.

I used speckled trout for this recipe. The caper flavor dominated the taste.

one of the best trout receipes I have made

What a wonderful dish to make - takes a little work, but worth every ounce of energy! I bought a bigger pan just to make two filets at one time... it is perfect for a romantic dinner! Now my husband begs me to make it more often...

We always are looking for new recipes for trout because my brother is always in the fishing turnements and we alway get at least 2 or 3, My son and I love the skin, however my husband and his friends aren't allowed to have so much fat so what I did was, I cut the trout in half, did half the way the recipe called for and the other half I cut the fat down. Both turned out great, but I personally like the recipe and will make it again.

Some of us did not care for the tarragon paired with trout, although we all usually like tarragon. To justify this fat and calorie content, we'd have to love it, but the response here was "just okay".

It was easy to make and--best of all--my husband liked it and said he hoped I would make it again. I made no changes or substitutions.

Great flavor. As a sop to my conscious, I cut the butter in the sauce to 3 tablespoons. Will do it again.

Sauce was a little bit dry and a bit too tangy. We're going to try adding wine and reducing.

I suspected the bacon would be overpowering. But, the sharpness of the lemon and the aromatic quality of the tarragon (I used mexican mint marigold) blended the flavors into something very light and fresh tasting. I substituted tilapia filets. This is an incredibly simple dish, a great Satuday afternoon lunch. I served garlic mashed potatoes and onions baked in wine. I'd be tempted to give it a 4 fork rating. But, the definition of 4 forks is 'a dish beyond compare'. It's not often that I come across a dish that is actually beyond compare. This one is great, though. Good summertime fare.

This is wonderful but boy is there a lot of fat in this dish! I've reduced the fat and the great flavor remains. I also use a whole trout, bone in, head on and tail and dorsal fins clipped a bit. The whole fish makes a great presentation.

This is also great with catfish filets. Mississippi is famous for its farm raised catfish and this is a perfect recipe for them.

I thought the dish was delicious and easy to prepare. However, did not like the fish skin and I would remake it using skinless fillets.

This is a keeper. We catch some beautiful trout in Idaho and this is a favorite way of preparing them. Some good bread and a glass of your favorite white wine makes a perfect meal.
