This was very good. Has just the right amount of heat. I could not find Summer Savory so I used sage. I will make this again. Yumm!

I'm not sure why this turned out so bad for me. I halved the recipe and I didn't have any Bulgarian paprika so I used regular paprika. I didn't add the cayenne since my kids don't like spicy. I couldn't even eat it. The buttery meat flavor was just yucky to me. It actually tasted a little better before I added the butter and flour. I may have been able to eat it if I hadn't added it, but I couldn't even eat it the way it turned out. It just tasted like butter and meat.

My favurite dish, substitute noodles with rice. It's originally done with rice. White rice... don't get many noodles in Bulgaria :) haha

A terrific recipe. I followed it to the letter, but next time I may use a bit less oil.

This recipe came out great. The meat was tender and just spicy enough. I did not brown or flour the meat as some reviewers suggested. Because I like a smooth gravy, I did strain the onions prior to thickening the sauce.

Made this for a cool fall evening and everyone had seconds. Followed the recipe pretty closely except 1/2 tsp. lemon juice in lieu of lemon; 2 tbsp. hot Hungarian paprika, 1 tbsp. sweet, and skipped the cayenne. Served over spatzele...great!

I used to work for the Bulgarian couple who wrote this recipe and I have to tell you, I live it! I ate it more at work, than at home, though. When Bozidar would cook it, the entire resturant would smell like Heaven. Just the right spices ,and you can use rice, mashed potatoes, noodles or a bread bowl what ever you like. All are good. So, give it a try you won't be let down.

I used really good quality meat from my local butcher (O'Driscoll's) so this dish was fast and easy. I only had a Tblsp. of sweet paprika, so I mixed 2/3 hot paprika and 1/3 hot and cut the cayenne pepper by 1/2. Very nice for a quick meal on a cold winter night.

I floured the meat and browned it while the onions were cooking, then continued to follow the directions. I ended up simmering the dish for about 3 hours, 2 hours with lid on and then another hour or so with lid off, until the sauce was thick so I could skip the flour/butter paste step. Served with garlic mash potatoes

A great, easy recipe because you don't have to brown the meat! I omit the flour thickening step at the end and it doesn't suffer. Skip the noodles, and serve with a side of fresh spinach and it's a low carb meal.

As written, this recipe is only 2 forks (family very unimpressed). However, with a couple of changes the second time around, my family upped the rating to 3 1/2 forks. MODIFIED VERSION: Quite frankly, the lemon lends an odd smell & taste to the stew, so I omitted it. I used fresh savory, and doubled the amount. I also added 4 cups of chopped veggies (mushrooms, gold yukon potatoes, celery & mushrooms). I made sure the broth was nice & thick, and then served the stew over garlic mashed potatoes.

Oh man! I just finished a bowl of this and I have to say, mouth watering! The combination of the spices and the stewed beef with the egg noodles is so delicious. I have to say this is one of the best beef stew recipes on epicurious. Anyways, make careful preparation that you don't dry out the beef, that was my only qualm about this recipe, but it was probably my own fault. I followed this recipe exactly and it was amazing. Reminded me of a toned-down version of a Boeuf Bouguignon. To add more flavor, use very fresh sprigs of savory, thyme, even some rosemary, and I added some hot pepper flakes for spice. Good stuff and will make again for sure!

Quick to put togeher, uses ingredients I have on hand and tastes good. A definite keeper that I will make again. I put the noodles in the broth to cook instead of cooking separatly.

a little heavy on the garlic and cayenne for my taste, but worth trying again and again with a little modification!

This was the first time I used summer savoury in a stew. Although it very much resembles thyme its flavour is even stronger. The next time I'll use a little less. I was also thinking of making it with pork shoulder in exactly the same way. Perhaps only substituting white wine for red. I believe in those areas pork is more prevalent than beef. Anyway, a keeper.

Found this recipe while in search of a stew recipe other than a tomato or gravy based one. We totally enjoyed this served over steamed white rice. While the onions, garlic, and bay leaves were sauteeing, I seasoned, floured, and browned the beef in another pan then when the onion mixture had been browned and carmelized, I mixed the beef back into the main pan and continued the recipe as written. Loved the addition of lemon zest and I did reduce the cayenne to which I am glad. Sub'd thyme for the savory. Added cubed potato, carrot, and celery during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Next time will increase liquids to produce more sauce. Our best friend is Bulgarian so I'm curious to find out if this recipe is truly traditional or an adaptation.

Very good. I was only cooking for 2, so I used only 1 lb. of beef -- but mostly kept the rest the same. I used 3 cups of onions, 8 bay leaves, and discovered that I was nearly out of paprika, so used only 1 teaspoon -- I diced a small red bell pepper to make up for the lack. I didn't have any summer savory so I substituted thyme. I also floured and browned the meat, then removed it while I cooked the onion mixture. It was great. I made it a few days ahead, and then we ate it -- the lemon flavor became a bit more prominent (I liked it better on the initial tasting). Served it with homemade spaetzle mixed with peas to add some more vegetables to our meal. The sauce is delicous! Will definitely make again.

Doubled the stock, browned beef in wholewheat flour, fresh ground pepper & seasalt. Wondered about lemon, but was really good. Added chunky pieces of carrots, parsnip and celery served over basic mashed pototoes. Still enjoying leftovers and we hate leftovers!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe, except I salt, peppered and floured the beef. Then I removed the onion mixture from the pan and browned the beef in a little fat. I put the onion mixture back and continued with the recipe. Yummy!

I loved the recipe except I always brown stew meat first coated in flour. It sets up a great roux. Then add the garlic, onions etc. Pour in wine and stock to create the rich gravy. My kids adore this dish. Comfort food? Oh Yeah!

The comment "I'm not a stew person but I liked this recipe" convinced me to try it. It is very, very good. For my family of three, I cut the recipe in half and still had leftovers. Tonight, I've thickened the leftovers a bit with some cornstarch and added some lightly sauteed mushrooms; this will be going in puff pastry pie shells for a dinner of individual meat pies. I will definitely make this again (and I'm not a stew person!).

I cut out this recipe back in '97 and finally made it yesterday. It was delicious - my husband loved it and said that it was the best stew I ever made. I could not find summer savory in the grocery store, so I left it out. I cut the recipe in half because I only had about a pound or so of meat, except I put in 1/3 cup of the wine,since that's a small amount. I also was conservative with the cayenne pepper. I actually served the dish with white rice, which went great with it. This stew will definitely be served again and again in my house.

WHEW! If I had added all of the stuff the cook before me did, I'd have a wierd tasting dish, also. Great version of stew. It may not be authentic, but it sure hit the spot on a cold rainy evening! Sure did smell good, too. Family walked in the door drooling!

Weird flavor. I fretted over this for almost 2 hours adding salt,some sugar and finally sour cream to finish. I used more red wine than called for. Instead of the flour/butter mixture I floured the meat (thinking I was going to brown it:I must have been thinking of another recipe) but it thickened the sauce up fine. Very rich.

I disagree with Maria. Bulgarians do make dishes with beef, however, they use veal more then beef, which is drier. I believe the original recipe uses a can of tomatoes to thicken the sauce and does not contain lemon peels. The dish is traditionally served over mashed potatoes and rice and pees. Try it with veal, you'll like it.

I made the dish with a pork roast, but the flavor was still excellent. In fact, I believe the pork was more tender than the beef would have been. Like others who have reviewed, I served the dish over garlic mashed potatoes, but noodles would also work well. Might double the butter/fluor thickening agent if going over noodles.

I thought this stew was yummy. I added egg noodles directly into the pot and served it with garlic toast. I will definately add this to my personal recipe book.

I halved the recipe and that seemed to work out well. The sauce was zesty and the meat was tender. I would make it again but it s not something that you could eat frequently.

As a recipe per se, this was fine - but very Americanized!! In Bulgaria, we eat very little beef and rarely put it in a stew like this; this recipe is more like a "gyuvech", which is always made with pork. Also, we never serve such dishes "over noodles". Perhaps you are thinking of Hungarian cuisine?? The bay leaf part was authentic, though.

I would make this again although I would cut down on the bay leaves. It had a very different flavor but on the whole was easy to make and tastey.

An easy dish to prepare. A nice hearty meal for winter with a little zip. I would make it again. My husband loved it. Will make a good left over or as the recipe said you can prepared the day before.
