This recipe leads to a very wet stuffing. In future attempts I will lower the amount of liquid to about a quarter less than is listed in the recipe. I also substituted the pomegranate to apple.

This was an interesting variation but the pomegranate juice was too tart for many of my guests. I tend to agree with them and will try cranberry juice next time I make it. I also added pignolis which were a tasty addition

This was my first time making a bread pudding-type dish, and I followed the advice of the other reviewer and toasted the bread. My family loved it, and hardly any of it was left over. My only complaint is that I tried to increase the amount of the ingredients so that I could make enough to fit into a 13x9 dish, and I think I went a little overboard on the fruit ingredients. It came out a little sweeter than I expected.

In an effort to add more dimension to the regular TG feast, I've concocted similar recipes to this over the years. Three things I recommend - make this recipe a couple of days in advance of the meal. Give the flavors a chance to meld. 2) in a tiny bit of butter (it won't kill anyone), saute the pears separately, and 3) lightly toast the cubed bread. It's all good for you and yummy.
