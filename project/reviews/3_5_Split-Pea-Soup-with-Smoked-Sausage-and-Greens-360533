Yummy and hearty and simple. I followed the advice of a couple of other reviewers and sautees some onion, carrot, celery and a couple of new potatoes and added at the end when I had pureed and was putting back the sausage. Very tasty -- will make again!

Great starting point for a sausagy split pea soup. I find that adding in some of the other ingredients normally included in split pea soup (leeks, shallots, potatos) can really make this a great dish.

So good and easy. Makes a ton. I haven't tried to freeze it yet. As I've learned, whenever a recipe says to add sausage directly into water, brown separately, otherwise the water will suck the flavor out of the sausage--so take the reviewers' advice on that. I sauteed onions and carrots w the sausage. Yum.

I followed the recipe exactly and used Aidels Andouille sausage as other reviewers suggested. It was very flavorful and even better the next day. I ended up adding another 1/2 bag of cooked split peas because it seemed very thin to me after blending. I did not blend the extra split peas. I would like to try it with some sauteed onion and carrot as well, but it was delicious without.

I give this recipe 4 forks because it is such a simple base soup with tons of options for those that love to tinker with recipes. I've made it several times; today with chicken andouille sausage. I always take the stem/vein out of the bay leaf before I blend. I also always saute some diced carrot and onion and brown the whole sausage before adding the the peas and stock. A cold weather favorite. I have no idea how this feeds only 4... I'd say 6. I like my soup thick, so 8c is always enough broth.

Very quick, and smoky! I used a smoked Slovenian sausage from Azman Quality Meats in Euclid, Ohio. It's one of the most sinful smoked sausages out there,(get Lipitor ready), and did a great job giving the soup a sultry vibe. I used an immersion blender. Better than the old exploding blender. Hit it with some hot Hungarian paprika as well---maybe a teaspoon---to give it a back-bite.

Easy. Used deer andouille sausage. No additional seasoning needed. Fantastic. Thanks!

Made this recipe a few days ago and really enjoyed it. I would, however, add more peas or a little less water for a thicker soup. I also had issues pureeing the bay leaves, so I would remove them the next time. Last, I added some sauteed shallots (ran out of onions) and carrots to the soup once it was ready.

Super easy and really tasty! I used the Aidell's Andouille sausage and it added a nice little kick to the soup. I also used the dried bay leaves and didn't have a problem when I pureed them.

My peas weren't tender after 35 min so I let them cook for 15 min more but they still weren't totally tender. Also, it seemed as though I had too much broth. Did I make this wrong??? So strange. Good flavor though. I used a smoked ham hock instead and that was delicious.

Fabulous soup, my husband and I absolutely loved it! I used Aidell's Andouille sausuage, which gave a nice kick to the flavor, and since the market didn't have kale I substituted curly mustard greens. Like others I removed the Bay Leaves before I pureed the soup. Very easy to make, and simply delicious! This one is for sure a keeper.

This soup would have been a total cinch to make if not for the bay leaf glitch. My advice would be to make a bouquet out of the leaves and remove them before pureeing. Also, if you have an immersion blender, that would be the way to go. In my case, I had to transfer the soup in several batches to the blender, then strain it into a bowl, and then add it back to my pot. Kind of a hassle for an "easy 5 ingredient" recipe. Still, it was very good.

I used Kielbasa instead of the recommended sausage and it turned out great. I also added carrots to add some brightness and color. Great quick soup.

Best soup ever! I used raw chicken parmesan italian sausage, cooked it in the pot prior to starting soup. Perfecto. I used dried bay leaves and they were still too coarse after shredding. Next time I will place bay leaves in bouquet garni bag to make easily removable.

Simple and good, a nice twist from the usual ham. I didn't do the puree as I prefer the texture of the peas that way. I just cooked them a little longer adding broth to let them get a little mushy.

my husband loves split pea soup and LOVED the kale in this recipe. the flavor was as good as any split pea soup i've made, but the peas continued to soak up the liquid after i stored the leftovers. a little stock turned the block of peas back into soup for leftovers. the soup was better the next day!

Very easy and super tasty. We used dried bay leaves and they were not an issues when pureed. We'll definitely make this again and again.

Oh and about the bay leaves. This was the only flaw in the recipe. Pureeing the soup with those in it was not a good idea. I had to strain them out. I used fresh ones but I am sure dried would have been fine. Either way, next time I'd remove them before pureeing.

This is a great and very easy soup to prepare! I was a little worried because it sounded so simple, my four year old helped me make it! But it was absolutely spot-on-- one of the best split pea soups I've ever had. Two changes that I made: I did not find Linquica and I got confused and instead of buying Andouille I bought Polish Kielbasa, which was excellent in the soup. And I did not have chopped Kale; I had Swiss Chard from my farmer's market so I used that. In my opinion the greens were nice but certainly optional-- the soup is perfect without it! This will be a falltime staple in our house.

Are those fresh or dried bay leaves?
