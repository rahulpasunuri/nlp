I would make it again with these changes: boil longer, it is too sticky, needs to harden more. Spray cooling racks with cooking spray to help take them off the rack. Use popsicle sticks instead of forks, I did. This was for a kids Halloween party. Flavor and color are fine.

Although the flavor and color of the apples are great, the texture is definitely too sticky. I agree with the other reviewer who stated that the syrup needed to cook up another ten degrees. However I doubt that even the additional cooking would've transformed the syrup adequately. Because of the chewiness/stickiness, I would definitely recommend another candy apple recipe. Won't use this one again.

Too messy to bother with, although my husband liked it better than the kids. If I tried it again, I'd increase the candy temperature about ten degrees...It wasn't hard enough.

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. Great dessert for children. Children would have fun with parental help making these apples. Thanks Selina-Louisiana

These were very sweet & colorful, but I prefer caramel apples. Corn syrup is hard to obtain in Europe and is better used for other things (almond brittle).
