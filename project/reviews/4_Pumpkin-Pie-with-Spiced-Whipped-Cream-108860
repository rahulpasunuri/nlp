Followed this recipe with the following changes: Substituted a home made version of sweetened condensed milk found in an online search instead of driving 20 miles to get the can. Used Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream & graham cracker crust to cut calories/fat. Made my own pumpkin pie spice mix with plenty of nutmeg and fresh ginger. It was very well received at a community dinner I donated it to for Thanksgiving dinner. Next time I would make with pie crust to meet my husband's taste for extra fat! Why is he so lean?

Added a tablespoon or a good shot of bourbon and the pie stood out among the best.

I use the little 4" mini graham cracker pie crusts and it makes this even better! Paired with the spiced whipped cream, my guests can't get enough! Especially useful for serving at a party, as each guest gets one mini pie. This is a new family tradition!

I've been using this recipe for years it is by far my favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Will never use a different one. Made several of these pies for a friends fall wedding, not a single slice left, and was asked repeatedly for the recipe!

I eat it raw from the bowl...it's that good!!!!

Goodness, this was a big hit! I've made these four times so far. I altered the presentation, and the flavor, by serving this in the tiny personal graham cracker pie crusts. You can find them in the baking aisle and they're perfect for parties. The graham cracker sweetness goes extra well with the spiced whipped cream!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, but I substituted fresh roasted pumpkin (2 C.), and added freshly grated nutmeg, whirled it all in the food processor for about 3-5 min. I had an exceptionally smooth and wonderful pie! Plus, the whipped cream is amazing. I tried it in my coffee too - what a treat. Also, I made my own pie crust, not store bought.

Made it yesterday for Thanksgiving, and people really liked it, especially the consistency and not too sweet. I think I like a little more "pumpkin" and a little more spice. But, it was great! Making it again now for the post-Thanksgiving "left-overs" party since there weren't any left overs

I thought this was just OK. It is very airy (despite the sweetened condensed milk)-but not very "spicy." I guess we prefer the denser, more intense type of pumpkin pie. "Pumpkin Pie Lite" came to mind-and fine, if that's what you're after.

I have made this pumpkin pie recipe on three different occasions and everytime everyone wants the recipe!! It's super easy and tasty!

I did not make the spiced whipped cream, so this review is solely about the pie itself: It is delicious. The spices are really well balanced and the sour cream smooths out the pie to make it very creamy and delicious. I purchased a pre-made crust for this dish, which I did not enjoy very much, but since the crust was not a component of this recipe, it is not negatively affecting my rating. On my next attempt, I will try making a homemade graham cracker crust (my favorite pie crust).

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made. Smooth, creamy, and spicy.

We made our own crust from a John Ash recipe. This was superb! As other reviewers said, many people said this was the best pumpkin pie they had ever tasted. I'd have to agree. I was pretty impressed. It's a keeper. I did use fresh pumpkin (same quantity) & added about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. It was a "wowzer!" ;)

I didn't think this was any better than any other pumpkin pie recipe I've tried. I also made a hazelnut praline (crumbled) to sprinkle over the whipped cream.

WOW!!! So simple and so fabulous. I don't use sour cream and so I left it out, FABULOUS pie and the whipped cream is the kicker. RAVE reviews.

Made the spiced whipped cream to top my regular Libby's pie. Ran out of whipped cream before half the pie was even eaten. Super easy, will have to make more for my leftover pie!

Rating: 2
Hmmmm, not sure. It had a good taste for sure, but what threw me was the texture. It was TOO creamy and seemed underbaked even though it had plenty of baking time. It was like a cross between a pumpkin pie and an underbaked cheesecake. I don't think I'll make again . . . however, I will use the spiced whipped cream and stick with my regular pumpkin pie recipe.

made my own pie crust. used fresh pumpkin. great filling! this will be my go to recipe.

Rating: 4
Mmmmmmmmmmm! What a great filling, it was light and moist. I could have cooked it a bit longer but anyways, it was yummy. I love spices, so I will but a pinch more of the spices (not that it wasn't flaverful). The crust I did not by, I used anouther recipe for the crust and it sure was yummy. Everyone said it was delicicous and my aunt wanted the recipe! It was easy to make and the topping put it up there! Again, I would put a tiny-weenie bit more spieces in the whipped cream, that is however if I for some reason don't put extra spices in the filling. Overall, very good make 2 pies because people will be going back for seconds!!

Wow wow wow!! This was the best pumpkin pie! I took it to a my family thanksgiving, and everyone loved it! I wish I would have made two of these rather then one! I would change a thing about this recipe.

one more good trick for this recipe is to skip the sour cream. i did this by an accident but it still turned out amazing! for people that are trying to watch their weight and/or count fat, this would be best for you

Rating: 3
The whipped topping makes this pie very special. To be a four fork recipe, this really needs a homemade pastry. Also, the filling makes two pies, not one. There wasn't a bite left after Christmas dinner. The children loved it with an extra heaping of whipped cream on it.

Rating: 3
It seemed odd to me to prebake the crust for a pumpkin pie, but since there were no other review comments on that, I decided to follow the directions. I made my own crust (from America's Test Kitchen cookbook). Didn't think about using pie weights and the crust collapsed when pre-baking and I had to start over. Didn't pre-bake the second time around and it came out very good.

Rating: 4
This was the best pumpkin pie I've ever made! I followed the recipe except that I added a crunchy pecan topping from another recipe on this site--the pairing was to die for. I usually make my own crust but I was pinched for time so I used store bought & nobody could tell because the filling was so delicious. The spiced whipped cream is a must.

This pie was so easy to make and delish! I used a Marie Callendar's frozen pie crust. I will definitely make this again next year. I personally thought the pie tasted better chilled.

I LOVED this pie! It was a huge hit and I did double the spices as per the other reviews...great idea! I don't like pumpkin pie but this was so tasty!

Rating: 4
I made this recipe four different times during the Thanksgiving festivities and each time it turned out great. I used a regular frozen pie crust and had a little filling leftover, but I found that if you double the recipe and use two 9" deep dish crusts, you have very little leftover. I followed other people's suggestions to be heavy handed with the spices, which turned out great. If you use the spices for the whipped cream (and I really recommend that you do!), be careful not to go overboard with those spices, otherwise it is a little overkill with the spices!

Rating: 4
Amazing pumpkin pie. I was heavy handed with the spices and didn't bother with the cream - just served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

I only made the spiced whip cream, but it made my libby's pie so much better! Everyone wanted to know what I used to make the whipped topping taste so good, and my mom actually wouldn't leave my house until I told her my "secret" recipe. I should have made twice as much spiced whip cream because everyone wanted seconds.

I've been looking for a recipes like this. Can't wait to make it for my family this Thanksgiving. I'll let you know how it turned out.

So far, I've made 9 of these pies, used a graham cracker crust, everyone LOVED them! Getting ready to make 3 more. Wouldnt change a thing (did use fresh pumpkin), people telling me, it was creamy and the best pumpkin pie they've had. And honestly this is a REALLY easy recipe. Enjoy!

Made as written for a Thanksgiving dessert. Made two deviations: #1 We used gingerbread spice from Epicure instead of ginger, and #2 we bought the frozen normal sized TenderFlake pie crusts cause we couldn't find the deep-dish one. There was enough filling for three pies...and I think I like using the not so deep pies. Everyone LOVED it! They said it was the best pumpkin pie they ever had. I felt so proud. :D

Absolutely delicious, much better than store-bought pumpkin pie! Everyone who tried this loved it. I used the recipe as it's written.

This was my first attempt at baking a pumpkin pie. I substituted ground cloves for allspice and I increased the spices as others suggested and it was tasty but not overpowering. I used whipped cream with sugar and vanilla instead of the spiced whipped cream and it was delicious.

I mad this yesterday. I have always used evaporated milk in the Libby's recipe so using condensed milk intrigued me. I like his recipe a lot. Everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner just loved it! It was a big hit.

Wonderful pie! I agree with the other reviews...the spiced whipped cream is amazing!

The Pie was amazing! After reading other reviews I was generous with the spices and it turned out great! The Spiced whipped topping absolutely made the pie. I was assigned pies for my very large family thanksgiving dinner and I planned to make 6 but the recipe multiplied by 6 made 11 pies!! Just expect to have some filling left over. I am now on permanent Pie duty for Thanksgiving!

over all the recipe was fantastic and have made it multiple times and will in the future but the one correction i would add is to double up on all of the spices. you can get a slight flavor but not nearly enough. OVERALL GREAT!

I served this to a group who was indifferent to pumpkin pie and they fell in love!! The only change I would make is to add some vanilla in the whipped cream. Everyone else thought it was perfect, but next time I am going to add a little vanilla to the Spiced Whipped Cream.

I made this with fresh pumpkin (vs canned) and it turned out phenomenally well. Everyone raved over it and the spiced whipped cream. One gentleman who does not normally like pumpkin pie even enjoyed it. It is definitely worth the little extra effort to bake a pie pumpkin, and then puree it for the better flavor and texture. I baked my pumpkins at 400 degrees for an hour & a half.

I did a taste test between this recipe and the one on the can of Libby's Pure Pumpkin. Though this one looked a little prettier (and visually, my guests thought they would prefer it), the Libby's recipe pie won hands-down. The Libby's pie was smoother, richer, and more flavorful. The recipes are very similar, but the Libby's recipe calls for evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed; adds 3/4 cups of sugar; eliminates the sour cream; and the spice mixture is 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. cinnamon; 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves. It's right on the back of the can. This recipe is good. But the Libby's recipe is much better.

Rating: 4
Yum! An incredible pumpkin pie recipe, and the whip cream was amazing also. I made it with real pumpkin and freshly ground spices and it was perfect. I was a little discouraged by the batter but it turned out perfectly and the surface didn't crack like many other pumpkin pie recipes I've tried. I would make extra of the whip cream, no one could get enough of it!

I'm not a huge fan of pie, especially pumpkin pie, but I made this for my partner and ended up eating several slices before he even got to try it. It's so delicious! Instead of the suggested crust, I made a graham cracker crust, but I'm sure it's good either way. Definitely planning on making it again...soon!!!

I have made this at least five times now and every time it's been absolutely divine. My boyfriend claims it's the best pumpkin pie ever. The very first time I made it with a pumpkin from the backyard and I have to say it's been difficult to recreate the taste of those first two pies, so the quality of the pumpkin is crucial.

Rating: 4
This is the first pumpkin pie I've ever made and this was extremely easy to make and the results were delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the other spices listed. I also managed to use almost all the filling in the pie, resulting in a very pretty, very full slice. No problems with spilling. The spiced whipped cream was lovely. I am looking foward to making this again.

Oops - I reviewed the wrong recipe in my previous post. That review is for the Spiced Pumpkin Pie from this site. I followed this recipe as directed and the reult was an "OK" pie. Not bad at all, but not one I'd care to make again - I like more spice in my pumpkin pie. My guests really enjoyed this, though.

I made this pie twice and it's become my favorite pumpkin pie. Doubling the spices is a must. I also tried this with soy milk b/c my daughter has dairy allergies & the taste and texture was still very good.

A delicious, easy pumpkin pie recipe. I used the "buttermilk pie crust" recipe, also from this site - I can't recommend that recipe enough. BTW if you taste the unbaked pumpkin filling and it's really sweet, don't worry it's perfect once baked.

This was a great pumpkin pie recipe. Very easy to make. In the future I would use a little less condensed milk just to lessen the sweetness, also a little cream cheese would be a great adddition to the already creamy filling.

A classic pumpkin pie with outstanding flavour. I used low fat condensed milk and no flavour was comprised. This pie has a really nice texture, not gelatinous like some pumpkin pies can be. For something different, I tried a gingersnap crust, but next time I would probably use the traditional pie crust. Delicious!

This recipe is quick and easy to prepare, a definate advantage in the midst of the holiday chaos! The pie isn't a fancy one, but it gives a nice result and was a bit hit with the entire family. And my 5 year old & 2 year old - notoriously finicky eaters - not only had a great time helping to prepare this dish but actually tried it (something new!) and gobbled up every last bite (unprecedented!). I would definately make this again.

I made my own pie crust (flaky pie crust--bon appetit june 2000) and omitted all of the spices in the pie recipe. Instead, I used 2 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Really good! My husband went on and on about this pie. He loves pumpkin pie, but is really picky about it. He said this was the best one he'd ever had. It had a very nice consistency and has more of a "pumpkin" taste than cinnamon-y.
