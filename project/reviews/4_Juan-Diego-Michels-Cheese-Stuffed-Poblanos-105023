Forgot the missing instruction about frying the plaintains and blanching the grapes and just put the fruits into the sauce with the mango. The dish was delicious - a really nice change. I used a mix of queso fresco and Monterrey jack but liked the melted texture of the Monterrey jack better. Skipping the plaintain frying and using less butter to grease the peppers reduces the fat content significantly and makes for a pretty healthy dish.

I made this recipe as directed with the following changes: substituted banana for plantain (and put in the sauce towards the end), omitted the basil (I did not have any), stuffed the peppers with a combo of cooked shrimp, cilantro, queso fresco, jack cheese, and cumin, and layered the peppers as they fell apart when I roasted, peeled and de-seeded them. It came out amazing! I agree with other cooks that you can omit the butter and oil- just use a little oil for roasting/broiling the garlic and onions. I used about 10 cloves of garlic and 2 large onions so it was not as sweet. I also used canned tomatoes and put the entire finished sauce in the blender before adding to the stuffed peppers. Definitely time consuming but worth it! Next time I will make a double recipe and freeze a batch before final cooking.

Although the ingredients were a bit intimidating...I set out and tried to conquer this recipe...to my surprise it was wonderful to the palate. Simply delicious...although timely to make it was well worth the wait and preparation. I don't think I would strain the tomatoes next time.

I made this on the spur of the moment, substituting peaches for the mango and banana for the plaintain. I left out all the oil or butter, and sauteed the onions and garlic in cooking spray. I didnt strain the sauce either. We loved it, but I'd use the plantain the next time and cut the peppers to strips, rather than stuffing them whole.

Hrmmm, bizarre combination, though fruit is extensively used in Mexican cooking, this is the first time I've seen it in a tomato sauce this way. Queso fresco would be the cheese used in Mexico for this dish. I've also never seen butter used with chiles rellenos. I feel that the fruit would definitely be lost in this sauce. I lived in Colima for many years and never came across a dish like this, but who knows? I love to cook with fruit, I make a huge variety of authentic Mexican food, but I'm not so sure about this one. I guess I'll simply have to try it and see.

Thanks, cook from NY for that extra info. I would give this recipe 4 forks based on my own judgement, but my husband wasn't as thrilled with it. It has a real sweetness to it that might turn some people off. I thought the flavor was really very interesting - it is all a matter of your taste.

A great recipe. Unfortunately the first few paragraphs of the recipe from the magazine are missing here. They are as follows: Gently rub chiles inside and out with butter and arrange, cut sides up, in 1 layer in a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Stuff chiles with cheese, leaving chiles slightly open to expose cheese. Blanch grapes in boiling water 20 seconds, then drain and peel. Heat 1/2 cup oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry plantains in 2 batches, turning once, until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Preheat broiler....

I loved this recipe. Using queso fresco is a great idea. I am also thinking about adding baby shrimp to the cheese stuffing. I thought the fruit held up well in the sauce. I don't think this dish needs a lot of sauce-it is almost like a chutney accompaniment. I did add a little water to the bottom of my dish before baking because I was concerned about burning.

I loved the stuffed peppers, but while the sauce was tasty, I think the fruit did little for the dish. You could not even discern the mangoes and the plantains were just mush. The grapes held up, though. I will definitely make it again, only using the grapes and perhaps carrots for sweetness. I agree with the other cook, not enough sauce. The missing instructions are: Gently rub chiles inside and out with butter and arrange, cut side up, in a 13x9x2 glass or ceramic baking dish. Stuff chiles with cheese, leaving chiles slightly open to expose cheese. Blanche grapes in boiling water, 20 seconds, then drain and peel. Heat 1/2 cup of oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry plantains in 2 batches, turning once, until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Am I missing something? I don't see the instructions for stuffing the peppers, just for making the sauce. Comments from those who have made this?

This is a great blend of flavors! To make it easier and less time consuming, I made the following changes: omitted butter, pureed diced tomatoes, minced onion, and water-preserved garlic for 2-3 minutes then added these (without sieving--there were no solids) to oil and cooked mangoes and grapes in it once it was hot--turned out just as smooth, lovely, and delicious as the recipe, but took out a lot of labor. There were no plantains at the market, but it was wonderful nonetheless. It was still a little work, but well worth it with the modifications. Showstopper!

I loved this recipe. It is a unique and delicious combination of flavors. I did cut it in half, but my husband and I were thrilled with the results. I thought it did not make enough of the sauce, so I'd not encourage too much reduction of the sauce next time. We also believe it may be more authentic with mexican queso fresco, but the end result was outstanding and unusual and we will make it again for guests. Also it did not take nearly as long to prepare as the recipe claims.
