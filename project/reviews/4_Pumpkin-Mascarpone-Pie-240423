This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe. It is Delicious! The texture is perfect. I do bump up the spices a bit because I LOVE those flavors. I confess that I use Trader Joe's frozen crust..shhh.

With a few simple changes, this is our new favorite! I added one egg, reduced the ginger by 1/2 and eliminated the cloves. My guests look forward to my pumpkin pies every year and agreed this version was fantastic. For years I have been making the Ultimate Pumpkin Pie recipe from Epicurious, but the mascarpone gives this pie a more velvet, creamy texture. Amazing!

Made it for a dinner party and was a big hit. I added extra pumpkin and served with vanilla ice cream. Definitely making it again soon!

Yum! This was very easy to mix and a great change from the typical boring old pumpkin pie. I plan to try it next time with freshly roasted pumpkin to compare the difference in flavor between canned and fresh pumpkin

Absolutely delicious. I did skip the whipped cream because I didn't get enough mascarpone, but after reading the reviews I will definitely try it next time.

This recipe was easy to make. The crust was nice and flaky. The filling was slightly too sweet for me, but very smooth and creamy. Also there wasn't enough pumpkin flavor for me. I think the mascarpone overshadowed the pumpkin flavor, but I'm also one that really likes pumpkin.

I've made this recipe numerous times and have always received rave reviews. The mascarpone adds richness and a smoothness that is not always there in regular pumpkin pies. This is now the only pumpkin pie I make!

I've always found pumpkin pie bland and since it was never in huge demand in my family, never made it. But this year my daughter wanted to see what the big deal was. I changed this slightly, using ricotta instead of marscapone and increased the vanilla a bit. Made it a day ahead and got raves from my guests, who asked for small pieces (guess they've had the same boring experiences) then came back for more. I used fresh nutmeg and loved the kicked-up spice taste. Will do this again

I used my crust recipe but the rest was creamy and delicious- totally rad!

This was fantastic. I made a few modifications: 1. Made a 150% recipe - I hate how pumpkin pies are always so thin in the crust. 150% was slightly too much, I probably threw out 4 tablespoons of filling, but the curst was completely filled. Bake time was ~75 mins. 2. Used 2/3 light brown sugar and 1/3 dark brown sugar. 3. Used 1/2 canned pumpkin and 1/2 canned sweet potato.

This was a hit! I even used a prepared pie crust from Trader Joe's. There were no leftovers. The only alteration I made was adding a 1 1/2 teaspone of the spices. This is a keeper and definitely surpasses a traditional pumpkin pie.

I would prefer this recipe more in a cheesecake form with less pumpkin and a secondary topping spread on instead of the dollop of whipped cream.

Lovely melange of traditional pumpkin pie spices. Spread mascarpone topping on pie four hours before serving. This recipe is a "keeper."

This pie was delicious--rich and creamy. And the pie crust recipe is the absolute best I have ever tried and will be the only one I use going forward. The only issue is I could not find a regular pie plate--only deep dish--so the filling looked a little skimpy in the plate.However, no one seemed to mind. I may make this the next time as individual tartlets for something different and festive.

Excellent! It was a big hit at Thanksgiving. The crust recipe is absolutely the best and easiest pie crust I have ever made

I don't think the marscapone added much to the pie or the topping. I'll stick to my standard pumpkin pie recipe.

I usually do not like pumpkin pie but loved this recipe. Very light and flavorful. I have never made pumpkin pie before but will now! The whipped topping is excellent! I ran out of mascarpone for the topping so I used cream cheese.

Exceptional! Rich and fluffy- it got RAVE reviews at thanksgiving. BY FAR my favorate pumpkin pie recipe, and also a great crust. I will definatly be making this every year.

This was a good pie but somehow, I expected "more". It was spicier than I expected (and I measure precisely and know I didn't use too much). I liked the texture and it did taste better as leftovers than it did on Thanksgiving (I made it the night before serving). Our guests all said they liked it, and my husband loved it, so to each his own! Personally, I'd prefer to try some other recipes next year.

Cheated w/Pillsbury roll-out crust. Would have been better if I had made the crust (or Cook's). Marscapone really made it!

Delicious and simple. However, use the pie crust recipe from the November/December issue of Cooks Illustrated which really is a miracle (it uses vodka, which allows the dough to be easily rolled out, but, since gluten does not form with alcohol, keeps it tender)

Rating: 3
Nice change of pace, very light and agreed, more pumpkin flavor came through. I cheated and use (GASP!) premade crust and my husband's homemade whipped cream, but in the end the pie recipe still stood out as a keeper. Even folks who didn't typically care for pumpkin pie tried this one and were pleasantly surprised.

Delicious! Nice flavor and texture. The topping was yummy too! I will definitely make this one again. A real keeper.

So, I didn't use the crust recipe,and I didn't make the topping because I forgot the extra mascarpone, so I just used fresh whipped cream. The pie was fantastic!! The spiciness was great. Everyone said it was the best pie they had eaten. My only issue was that it didn't come close to filling the pan, and since the topping called to be served on the side, it looked weird.

I will definitely make this again--the texture is fantastic and the crust was delicious and easy to work with. Like most BA desserts, I found this too sweet, so next time will reduce sugar to 3/4 cup and increase pumpkin by 1/4 cup.

My neighbor told me about this recipe and we both made one this year. I am new to pie making and this was a breeze and all 10 peopleI made it for said it was the best pumpkin pie they have ever tasted. I read the reviews before I made it and found them very helpful although I don't suggest skipping the whipped topping it was the best part!

Easy to make and tasty. It is somewhat on the sweeter side, but I find most pumpkin pie tends to be that way. Somewhat disappointing as it tastes like a traditional pumpkin pie - only slight hint of the mascarpone.

delicious.

This turned out too sweet for my taste (no one else seemed to have this problem- maybe it was the organic brown sugar I used that was a little darker than golden?) The taste and texture were too similar to traditional pumpkin pie to be worth the extra money spent on mascarpone. The spices were nicely balanced, but overall it was not as special as I had hoped.

It was nice and easy, but my girls ages 10 and 12 and I thought the mascarpone took away from the pumpkin flavor....I have been using the Silver Palette Pumpkin Pie recipe for years and it is still the best!!!

Like the filling. Kind of like Pumpkin Cheesecake but more pumpkin flavor and texture. Didn't like it with the crust. Making it for Thanksgiving and doubling the filling and substituting the crust for a gingersnap crumb crust and may Brulee the top if I can find a blow torch by Thanksgiving.

An excellent, rich, moderately spicy pie! The market was out of regular Mascarpone, so I substituted Tiramisu Mascarpone (just a nice mild espresso flavor). Super!!!

Rating: 3
Yummy. I added additional spices and vanilla. Even without the topping (to save calories) everyone liked the pie - not too sweet and no too rich. I was hoping it might be fluffier, so maybe next time I will beat more air into the batter?

Love those refrigerated pie crusts . . . :) My husband normally bakes the pies and he has an honored family recipe that he loves. But even he admitted that this combination is superior. THought the mascarpone adds a nice fluffiness to the pie and the lemon juice really brings out the pumpkin. Fun take on the whipped cream, too. I'll do that for more than just this combination.

Lazy beyond belief, I used refrigerated pie crust and skipped the whipped cream. I really enjoyed the spiciness and vanilla notes as well as the almost cheesecake-y texture. I also agree that it's better the next day.

I made this pie for guests and everyone raved. I thought the mascarpone in the filling gave it a nice flavor and texture. I will make this again for Thanksgiving.

tasted just like regular pumkin pie...the whipped cream w/ mascarpone is wonderful, however

This smelled and looked better than it tasted. It was extremely rich! and very spicy. It could have used more sweetness. (but as is, good with a nice port)

This pie was great, and got even better the next day. I forgot the lemon juice and used refrigerated pie crust, but it turned out wonderfully. Im making it again this weekend it was so yummy and easy!
