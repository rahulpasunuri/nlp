Absolutely perfect as written. I chopped my olives up in the food processor and sprinkled them over the sandwich before the final grill, and that worked nicely to keep them in place. This recipe is a keeper.

Great, easy, and very flavorful. A superb sandwich!

This has become a regular on the summer rotation at our house. I agreewith other reviewers that it can be a bit heavy on the olive oil at times but overall is a simple and delicious meal. I have also made individual portions of this as an appetizer by cutting the baguette into crostini and using the oven broiler. It is always a big hit.

These are fresh, delicious, and OUTSTANDING. I will definitely make them again. I agree that you could use less olive oil if you are so inclined. The sandwiches are very fast as long as you don't have to personally pit the olives, as I did. I served them with a fresh arugula salad, as suggested, and followed with fresh peaches w/ honey and sour cream, also as suggested. The peaches were almost as popular as the sandwiches. I highly recommend this recipe!

Very quick and easy, my husband loved it after I pressed it in the Panini grill. I would use a lot less olive oil the next time.

We've made this twice. We use about 2/3 the recommended amount of goat cheese. It's a great, quick summer meal.

Very tasty. I'm very used to making panini, so I just used this recipe as an idea, and eyeballed the ingredients. I thought it was wonderful. I'd advise taking it easy on the garlic. Since it's barely cooked, it has the potential to be very overpowering. I'd substitute additional basil.

Terrible! Way too oily. Not clear on what to do with the basil. Mix in with the "herbs"? The quantity of goat cheese was overpowering. I wouldn't bother with this recipe unless you really really LOVE goat cheese and lots of it.

The taste was incredible, but we found it very messy to eat. I served it with Arugula mixed with alittle salt and x-virgin olive oil.

Delicious and pretty easy to make! We made them open-faced, and did them under the broiler instead of on the grill.

A perfect summer dinner! After having just returned from a trip through Spain and France, this was a great throwback to the wonderful Mediterranean flavours that we enjoyed while there! I also added a bit of fresh mozzarella (for gooey factor). The dessert suggested was a perfect finish. I'll definitely make this again!

Great recipe, even if you really alter it. I wasn't paying enough attention and I accidentally added the goat cheese to the oil/garlic/herb mixture (I had cut the oil down to less than 1/4 cup), so I decided to just leave it out and allow the flavors to blend for a while. I spread the mixture on some kalamata olive bread, chopped up some olives and tomatoes and stuck them firmly in the cheese, and placed the whole thing in the oven for about 20 minutes. Easy enough to eat and terrific!

This was the great find of the summer. We loved it!

YUM! Fresh herbs are a *must* for this recipe. modified it a bit by adding grilled eggplant rounds along with some fresh basil atop just before serving. this was a great, quick summer weeknight recipe, perfect with a pinot noir. as others have mentioned, its a really good idea to have all the prep work done before you start grilling.

I also made this on a griddle instead of BBQ and it came out great. Instead of a baguette I used ciabiatta bread and I used about half as much oil as in the recipe and it still came out oily. But I will definitely make this again!

This was such a great week night meal when modified a little. Instead of using the grill we treated them like regular grilled cheese and cooked them in a skillet less the herbs and added fresh spinach all on sourdough bread. Really wonderful grown up grilled cheese with very little preparation.

This recipe is excellent, however, have everything ready to grill. I felt a bit harried, taking off, adding and putting back on. I did use goat cheese and the taste with our fresh tomatoes and basil was wonderful. Yes, I did add it just the tiniest bit, I topped with mozzerella, which helped to keep the olives on. I will definitely want to make this again.

Pretty good as described but FABULOUS with fresh buffalo mozzarella instead of the goat cheese!
