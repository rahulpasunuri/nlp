I have made this several times for family and friends and it always gets positive reviews. I definitely make it a day ahead to let the flavors meld. I also like to add in fresh herbs like chives and dill and add some lemon zest and/or juice to brighten things up a bit as well as more of the mustard. This is a great alternative to a traditional yellow mustard based salad.

Whenever I make this potato salad for a potluck, the serving bowl comes home empty. About the only things I adjust in this recipe are: add more sliced toasted almonds, add more bacon (which makes the vegetarians complain, but well, you can please all of the people all of the time), use dill gherkins instead of the bread and butter pickles, make my own buttermilk, and make my own "ranch dressing mix". I've found that the best thing you can do to potato salad to "meld" the flavors is to make it the evening BEFORE and then take it to where ever you are sharing it. Might be an answer for those who are complaining about the bland taste.

I loved the almonds and radishes in this salad, thought I would not, and now would not omit them. I believe the pickle should be omitted, or at least drastically reduced. Next time I'd use dill pickles instead of the sweeter ones. The Ranch dressing mix sets this apart. This version of potato salad is tasty, but I like other potato salads better.

This recipe was okay, not great though. It was not what I expected, it was alittle bland.

This recipe is EXCELLENT. I made only a few changes by omitting the hard boiled eggs, radishes and bell pepper. Also changed the bread and butter pickles to Vlassic Snackums. As others had suggested, I decreased the cooking time to about 20 minutes as I had peeled and diced them before cooking. Everyone in the family really liked it, including my quite particular husband. I can't imagine anyone not REALLY LIKING this recipe. Bonnie

This is a great recipe ! I have been making potato salad forever, and I always thought my recipes were very good......until I tried this one. I left out the bacon and almonds (didn't have any ) but I did add a bit of fresh dill..Yummy ! This is the only recipe I will use from now on. Never any leftovers.

This is the only potato salad recipe I use, and my bowl always comes home empty. One recommendation - I always try and cut fat and cholesterol where possible, but this it not the recipe for that. If you use l.f. sourcream and especially l.f. mayo, the flavor will definitely be toned down. Just have a little less... or not. :)

This is by far my favorite recipe for potato salad !! I agree with the other reviewer - I do use the entire envelope of dressing. And I cut back on the eggs as well - but it always meets rave reviews and there are no leftovers !

This was really good potato salad - I omitted the hard boiled as I don't like hard boiled egg in potato salad - I added the entire packet of salad dressing mix (omitting salt) which is a must to give this recipe enough flavor!

This potato salad was okay. I may make it again. I do believe that adding the entire packet of Ranch salad dressing is necessary. I also added much more dijon mustard than was called for. Fresh dill of course will make this better as well. And anything with bacon is always good!

I made this for a party and received quite a few compliments, some from people who said they don't usually like potato salad. I recommend using new potatoes and dressing them while still warm for the best flavor. I also used fewer eggs... the recipe can easily be altered to suit your taste.

This is the only potato salad I make. There are a lot of steps, but I amend the ingredients depending on what I have on hand. I often will use plain yogurt instead of sour cream, as an example, or leave out the bacocn, although that leaves a smokey flavor which is really nice! Good texture. A real crowd pleaser!

This was actually kind of bland, which is surprising given the list of ingredients. I wouldn't make it again, it took too much time and wasn't worth the trouble.

From the ingredient list, one might think this is the end all be all potato salad recipe. I made it and took over to a BBQ last night and only half of it was eaten. It was okay. The ranch sauce is mediocre at best.

This potato salad is very different than any recipe I've ever seen. Why I choose it for my mothers's retirement party I don't know, but I'm gald I did! I trippled the recipe based on numeber of invites. I swear the bowl weighed 20 pounds. Beleive it or not I could have quadrupled it, there was not a spoonful left. VERY GOOD!!!!

My son wanted a "ranch" potato salad similar to one sold at a local deli. This one, while OK, was not spectacular. The dressing was creamy and wasn't absorbed completely by the potatoes. I liked mouth feel and the salad looked good...but I need to keep looking for the ultimate ranch potato salad. I used red potatoes instead of russets, and celery instead of radish and I misread the directions and used a whole packet instead of 1/2 a packet of salad dressing mix (I am glad I made that mistake, might have been even less exciting with only 1/2 packet of mix.)

The perfect recipe, not to heavy. It works great with barbecue. Now I'm elected, to make it, for every hoilday meals .

I thought it was very good - and liked the idea of cooking the potatoes whole rather than peeling and cutting them into cubes. Sure made it a lot easier! I also added sweet pickle juice to the potatoes when they were still warm which adds a little tang. My 17 year old daughter had only one suggestion (or two, depending on how you look at it) - more eggs, and add olives. Will be making this again soon!

I made this for a barbeque to accompany baked beans and cheeseburgers. There wasn't a bite left. My guests said it was the best potato salad they had ever had!! Used pickle relish to cut down on cutting time and didn't add radishes (personal taste)

Yes, first time I ever made potato salad and it was delish. My did not turn out runny even the next day. I omit the almonds though. I subtituted the roasted red bell pepper since I have them instead of the green peppers and worked great. Don't omit the bacon, i think it was the key to the taste.

I have now made this recipe twice, it is a delicious potato salad, but I must admit I have never made any other recipe (I grew up in Rome) I have not been able to avoid it getting watery the next day despite taking every precaution AND adding less liquid, Just know its a lot of work and wont keep long.

This is a great recipe. I couldn't stop eating it. I used the whole packet of ranch dressing, but it still needed just a dash of salt & pepper which finished it off nicely. Next time I'm in to mood for potato salad--this will be the recipe!

Made this recipe for guests, my nephew with his southern girlfiend, and she said it was the best she's ever had. Added 1/4 cup sweet pickle juice to the potatoes while they were warm. Thought a full package of dressing made it too salty, would only use 1/2 as per recipe next time.

Rating: 3
Be prepared: This takes a good 2 hours to make, but it is very good. I did not add more ranch seasoning as someone else suggested, and I ended up wishing that I had. It ends up just a bit bland and I had to use a lot of salt and pepper on it. So I would double the amount of ranch seasoning that is recommended. And I would add the crumbled bacon only just before serving, so that it stays crunchy. Other than that it was fantastic, and got rave reviews from my family.

My husband, who usually doesn't like potato salads, absolutely loved this one. It was a big hit! I did not use mayonnaise because he doesn't like it, instead, i used yogurt, buttermilk, and Salvadorean sour cream. It was absolutely wonderful! The almonds are so clever!

Pretty good recipe. My husband, a self named connaisseur of potato salad, had a neutral reaction to it. The toasted almonds are definitely one of the high points of the recipe. Another plus is that it really helped clean out the excesses in the fridge! I also used the whole package of Ranch dressing to give it some more punch.

Oh my! This is such an incredible recipe. I omitted the almonds because I didn't think they were necessary; this potato salad already has so many different flavors and textures.

Delicious - this has become our standard potato salad. The textures and taste are wonderful - the only thing- it does take a bit of time to chop, dice and crumble everything. The end result is worth it, though. Especially like the addition of toasted sliced almonds and radishes for a bit of crunch and a hint of flavor.

This recipe was delicious. I made it the night before, and my only complaint would be that the bacon wasn't that crunchy when I served it. I did not add the radishes, and instead added celery and red onion chopped very fine. Also, I seperated the yolk and blended that in with the sauce, and also added a dash of tobasco. Rave reviews, will make it again!

This is a great potato salad. It does have lots of ingredients which are easy to forget. It took a couple of tries to get them all in. I love the crunchy radishes and the chopped pickle. I made half the recipe to serve with grilled game sausages and still easily had 6-8 servings.

This is one of the absolutely BEST potato salads I have ever tasted, yet alone made! The almonds, radishes, and bread/butter pickles meshed fabulously with the dressing. Definitely a "keeper"!

I didn't like this potato salad at all. To begin, I didn't think the recipe made enough "dressing" to coat all the ingredients, especially after absorbing into the potatoes for a couple hours. I thought the dressing was very bland, even after adding more Ranch dressing mix. I am convinced it needed either more mustard, or better yet, a good shot of cider vinegar. I thought that the still-chewy bacon bits and the crunchy almonds were very surprising and distracting while eating. I didn't think that the radishs added much to the taste or appearance of the dish. And finally, I guess it's a personal taste, but I find that the taste of the green pepper totally overwhelms everything else in the salad. Needless to say, I will continue scouting for better potato salad recipes.

This was the best potato salad I have ever had or made. All of my guests said the same thing. I did not have any Ranch mix, so I just added a 1/4 cup of actual Ranch dressing, and it was great. It didn't make it too creamy. I also used red pepper instead of green and omitted the dillweed. I will definitely make this many times again. The toasted alonds slivers were a very nice touch.
