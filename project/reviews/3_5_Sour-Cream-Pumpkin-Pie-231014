this thanksgiving i made 2 different pumpkin pie recipes to see which was best. this one won out by far, everyone wanting seconds reached for this one. it was delicious and not at all hard to make. i made the dough 2 days before making the pie and kept it in the fridge, followed the recipe exactly and it was great. i made the pie the night before thanksgiving and will certainly make it next year. my only advice is: if you want to be ahead of the game, don't be afraid to make it 2 or 3 days before thanksgiving (we ate leftovers the day after, so the pie was already 2 days old, and it was better than ever -- the flavors were more pronounced).

I am soooo glad to find this recipe. I used to have the Gourmet cookbooks published in the '60s (a wedding gift to my parents), but I lost them during a move. I loved this recipe, even people who don't like pumpkin or sweets seem to like it, and it's just like a rich chiffon pie. I used a regular lard pastry for the crust. The only thing I found is that it isn't necessarily as appealing to the eye when baked. One of my brothers called it a "cowpat in a crust", based on its appearance.

Very tasty. Requires more work than regular pumpkin pie. I have made it 2 years in a row now and always get great reviews from friends and family.

I made this pie back in 2004 when the recipe was first featured in Gourmet, and I think that it was wonderful! I try to make a new pumpkin pie recipe every year for Thanksgiving, and this is one of the best that I ever tried. Maybe it takes a little longer to make than the everyday pumpkin pie recipe, but for me it was well worth it. I don't know why I bothered to make anything else the last few years.

not worth the effort. pastry was yummy but i prefer a shortening crust; butter is just too expensive for a pie crust. use it where it counts. and you certainly need the beans or ceramic pie weights as the crusts can puff up like a croisant. the filling was way too sweet; i prefer the natural flavor of pumpkin with minimal sugar. too many steps involved (heating sour cream, etc.) for a result that is very similar to libby's from the can. thanks for a different recipe to try, however!

When I finished making it I thought to myself that I probably wouldnt be making this again because of how long it took, but then I tasted it and am now looking forward to the next occation to make it. I loved the tang of the sour cream, but can't wait to try it with the creme fraiche.

I found the tanginess of this recipe to be very strange. The texture was poofy and whipped. I must have overbeat the eggwhites. Didn't eat even a quarter of the pie before throwing it out.

i didn't find it was a lot of work, but i did find that it took a lot of time. it is a delicious pie, but count on the recipe making twice as much filling - and when it takes almost 6 hours to make a pie you'll want to get more than just one out of it, so it's just as well i suppose.

i am so annoyed that this recipe produced twice as much filling as i could fit in my single 9" pie plate. i'll rate it tomorrow after tasting it though.

Nice pie. To the reviewer below who mentioned the risk of raw egg whites: the filling is baked after the eggwhites are added, so I don't see where there is any risk.

I love this pie. It's traditional, but lighter (whipped egg white), and with the sour note from the sour cream. And (thank you, Gourmet) the instructions are clear, and when followed, are certainly "risk" free, if not also idiot-proof.

This is a recipe for perfection. I have been making it for years, and every year it brings bliss to pumpkin pie lovers. Those who come to my table without a passion for pumpkin leave with a new obsession. The effort required is no more than any recipe that is not "add box A to can B." The texture is lighter than custard-type pumpkin pies, and the flavor is just as rich with an ever-so-mild tang to offset sugary sweetness. Do yourself a favor, and make this pie.

Too much work for result. Also, it's not very safe to incorporate raw egg whites; I used pasteurized whites. The recipe should at least mention the (small, but real) risk.

I thought the dish was good but the texture was more like quiche than pie- I substituted the crust to graham cracker with apple juice and butter which gave a great sweetness.

Definitely not your traditional pumpkin pie! The filling reninded me of a mousse or a souffle, it was light and not too sweet. My only complaint is that the pie was pretty long to make and its preparation required several bowls, I wouldn't suggest making it if you don't have a dishwasher!

This was absolutely the best pumpkin pie ever!! It was loved by all, including the ones who usually don't like pumpkin pie (my husband and I) and those who love "traditional" pumpkin pie. It was a fair bit more work than the regular kind, but definately worth the effort! The only pumpkin pie I will ever make from now on!!

I liked the light texture, from the beaten egg whites, and the sour flavor. I suggest using a sugar crust.

This is a great recipe--the tang of the sour cream is fantastic. I too used the whole can of pumpkin and adjusted the spices. Not sure what people are complaining about. It's not that much work. I guess if you want easy you should go watch Sandra Lee's Semi-Homemade. She makes all kinds of easy crap. Gourmet magazine is for people who love to cook and who love to cook complicated, intricate recipes (but a simple pumpkin pie, with your own crust is not complicated.) P.S. Use Plugra European Butter--it makes all the difference in your crusts.

Alot of work--and the family preferred the recipe on the Libby's pumpkin can.

While the texture and appearance of this pie were wonderful, I tend to prefer a sweeter flavor. It's unlikely that I'll make this again. Next time I'll go back to my favorite pumpkin "pie" recipe - the pumpkin caramel cheesecake from this site.

I thought this was yummy. Yes, it was a bit time consuming for a pumpkin pie recipe, but definitely worth the effort. The beaten egg whites gave the pie a lovely light texture. I used the whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin and doubled the nutmeg and ginger to compensate for the extra pumpkin. I could have added more cinnamon, too. I also used creme fraiche instead of sour cream; I think creme fraiche has a sweeter and more pleasant flavor.

I also used the full 15 oz. can of pumpkin in the recipe, which is another reason I bumped up the spices.

This was yummy. Yes, it was more time-consuming than the usual pumpkin pie, but worth the effort. I subbed creme fraiche for the sour cream, and increased the nutmeg and ginger to 1/2 teaspoon. Could've bumped the cinnamon up a little, too. Delish.

AMAZING!!!! This was my first attempt at a pie, and it came out wonderfully...Light, fluffy...By far the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted. The sour cream does not make it "sour" it just gives it a delicious tang. I've been told I now have a new annual Thanksgiving responsibility! (P.S. I don't know why everyone's complaining about the effort involved...Are they just used to store-bought crusts?)

While my Thanksgiving company agreed that this pie should becoem a holiday mainstay, I would only make this time-consuming pie again if it were my only Thanksgiving responsibility. Don't get me wrong -- the pie is absolutely delicious. It has a perfect crust worth using again for other recipes and a pleasantly tart and airy filling. But there were way too many steps for what turned out to be a pretty standard pie. Could it be made without precooking the filling?

Really delicious! Yes, a little more time consuming but so much better than the average pie. It's thanksgiving. Doesn't the family deserve a little splurge???

Way to much work for a pumpkin pie. Don't get me wrong, it was great but I don't have that kind of time to into a pie, when I have others to make too.

I'm not rating this recipe, but it does sound good. For the person from Germany, how about weighing the pumpkin as the recipe indicates 13oz. Good luck.

I only needed one fork. But, Carol and Arnie used 2 each.

I loved how sour it was. It almost made my stomach a little sour though. I'll make it a little less sour next time. Fun to make, and tasty!!!!!

I'll give it 4 forks, because the recipe sounds fabulous. Unfortunately I can't really rate the recipe yet as I'm still trying to figure out how much fresh pumpkin to use because the canned stuff is not available here in Germany. Can anybody give me a clue please???
