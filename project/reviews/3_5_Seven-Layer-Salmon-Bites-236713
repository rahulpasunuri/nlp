I made these yesterday for cocktail bites before Christmas dinner. Followed the recipe exactly and, quite frankly, I do not see how it could be improved upon. My only complaint is that 1/2 lb. of the smoked salmon I bought was not enough for the number of slices of bread measured exactly as instructed. I am sure the brand of salmon varies as to number of slices so I would advise having an additional package on hand if it is important to produce the number of pieces indicated in the recipe. In my case, we had exactly the right number of pieces. Everyone loved it and, of course, it looks very festive.

Really great, tasty, great presentation and everyone loved it. Will make it again next Christmas.

Made this for Xmas eve. Most loved it, though I though there was too much cream cheese on the salmon. I wish there are a way to make cream cheese mixture a bit thinner and lighter.

Made this for a gathering last night. I increased the amount of cream cheese as someone had suggested, I would do that again. Easy to make and impressive although expensive.

For the person looking for a different bread choice, try a rye, if that doesn't work, try a German dark break that is a little sweeter. I made this for a shower, used round cookie cutters-no roe, dill to garnish-it was lovely. ChefGrammie--I'm the real deal!

We made this as an appetizer for Christmas dinner a few years ago and it was absolutely delicious!! It wrapped and kept well and was a lovely snack for the next morning as well.

A real hit! For added taste, I make the cream cheese mixture in advance and chill overnight. I double the lemon zest, lemon juice, salmon roe and use lots of scallion greens in place of chives. After layering the bread slices, I put them in the fridge for a while which makes cutting off the crusts smoother. Last step before serving is to top with the roe.

These were very well received, although I did make a few changes. I added a little fresh rosemary and some dill to the creamcheese. I finally had to give up on salmon roe, so bought the black caviar and added a small dab on top. Looked and tasted fine. Next time I make these however, I think I will just make two layers of creamcheese and one of salmon.

For variety I used a bread made of rice and chickpea flours with excellent results, as well as the pumpernickel. Any dense bread that can stand up to the soft layers of salmon and cream cheese should work. Several of my guests asked for the recipe.

I was just wondering if anyone could recommend another type of bread that might go well in this recipe as I don't like pumpernickel bread?

I made these for a recent party and they got rave reviews. Many folks asked for the recipe. I didn't get a chance to trim the sandwiches to perfection but it didn't matter. We also made half of them without roe for guests who don't eat it. The cream cheese mixture turned out well but it could have used a little more taste. Not sure what else to add, maybe more lemon. I will definitely make these again - they are a great dish for a party.

I agree with one of the other reviewers that this takes a little more cream cheese mixture than it suggests. I also used Tobiko, which is milder and better. It actually takes a fair amount of time to assemble this dish, so be prepared if you are thinking of it for a quick party appetizer!

I brought this appetizer to our friends' home for Christmas dinner . It was a big hit! I used Wasabi Tobikko (flying fish roe) - the roe "pops" in your mouth, unleashing the wasabi flavor to complement the salmon. I used alder smoked Alaskan salmon - very red and rich. A very simple and delicious appetizer.

Very Good - Christmas Eve 2006. To make them even more festive I topped the salmon roe with a touch of wasabi roe I found at Trader Joe's. Another great make ahead hors d'oeuvers. Seemed to take more cream cheese mixture than indicated.
