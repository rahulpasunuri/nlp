Love this rice - however I substituted the liver, etc. with Italian Sausage - so good!!!

I made this along with Crown Roast of Pork with Creole Mustard Sauce, and it stole the show! Definitely worth the effort. It goes wonderfully with pork but could also be used as a stuffing or side with a variety of meats. Like another reviewer I used giblets to make the gravy but added a little (about 1/2 lb) browned Italian sausage to the rice instead of the giblets and livers. I'm certain it would be excellent with the giblets and livers, it just seemed in my case that it would've been too heavy with the rest of the meal. To save time, you can make the giblet stock in advance and freeze it. Don't worry if the gravy separates when you add the stock - it'll come together towards the end of the simmering time.

Almost like my mother used to make BUT it needs a little spice - perhaps some red pepper would liven up the dish.

The CROWN ROAST OF PORK WITH DIRTY RICE STUFFING AND CREOLE MUSTARD SAUCE was our first meal of January 2000 - what a delicious start to a new year. My children still rave about the meal-especially the DIRTY RICE. Delicious!!

This recipe was delicious used as a side dish rather than a stuffing.

surprised to see a recipe so fairly translated without the culture shock you would expect. this is a reasonable & acceptable version of an old cajun classic which I make often, as a transplanted cajun.
