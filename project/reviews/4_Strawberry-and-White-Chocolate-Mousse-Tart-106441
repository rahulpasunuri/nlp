very nice recepie, easy to make if you have people dining at your home. i changed the crust and it was great too.

This pie is absolutely fantastic! I made it with blackberries instead of strawberries, and it received rave reviews - even from my most picky pie eaters. I used good chocolate, and I think that really helped make the pie great.

This recipe turned out perfectly. This occurred despite the fact that I only had an 11 inch tart pan, so I just sort of guessed my way through enlarging the recipe. If I had to do it over again, I'd err on the side of a thinner crust. My crust was thick enough that you had to use some force with your fork to cut through it after the tart had been in the refrigerator for hours. Also, I made my own jam rather than use store bough jam for the glaze. Turned out fine.

This may be one of may favorite things ever! The mousse was delicious and light and the crust was buttery and sweet. The strawberries and jam gave it just the necessary tartness to complete the dessert. My mousse was firm but did start to breakdown after the berries and jam were put on top. Put them on right before serving for best presentation.

OMG! This was easy and delicious! I have an 11" tart pan so I upped the chocolate and mouse ingredients slightly to fill the crust. I had no problem with it setting. It looked beautiful when presented to company and tasted every bit as good as it looked.

I've made this a few times, but most recently for Easter. I actually used 8 oz of white chocolate and added a couple of sheets of gelatin to make it hold up underneath the strawberry. The mousse was still creamy and delicious. Came out perfect. Such a beautiful looking dessert and taste just as good.

I made this for an easter dinner party a few years ago and it was almost too beautiful to cut into. Had no problems but agree with the time complaints. For me it is worth the extra 24 hours advance preparation, high quality chocolate and quality strawberries.

Not sure if it was an error on my part or not, But I used the mousse recipe as a filling in a cake. Well after chilling overnight it wasn't set enough to use as a filling. If I had made this whole recipe, using the crust, instead of making it a filling in a cake, I think the mousse would have just kinda collapsed as I cut the Tart. So maybe I did something wrong, not enough whipping or what...I'm not sure...BUT I solved the problem by adding some cream cheese to the mousse, by whipping it all together with my stand mixer and that did the trick for me to use it as a filling in a cake. Before adding the cream cheese the mousse did tasted wonderful and it tasted just as good after I added the cream cheese

I have to agree with the Cook from Moscow that this is good but not really impressive enough to warrant the effort (the recipe is simple but it does take time, and whipping the cream and egg whites can be tricky in hot weather). Also agree with the Cook from Lawrenceville that the filling tasted more like whipped cream than chocolate. I just tend to feel that when a dessert is this loaded with calories it should have a little more oomph. I'd pick a cheesecake or a key lime pie over this one any day.

This took a lot of work and was just average. I won't make it again.

Fine, but not outstanding. I used a little cointreau in the glaze. Company didn't ask for seconds, which is never a good sign. I think the cooking time for the pastry is too long - I used 15 minutes with the beans in, and about 18 without the beans.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly. I did use a teaspoon of meringue powder for the egg whites because so many complained that the mousse did not "set up". I chilled the bowl and beater before beating the cream and made sure the melted white chocolate was completely cooled. I waited until just before serving to add the strawberries. My guests asked for seconds. I would definitely make it again.

I made this for a baby shower I threw on Saturday and it turned out great! I only have an 11-inch tart pan, so I made half as much more of each ingredient, so I would have enough pie crust and mousse. It was so delicious and it was a big hit. I will definitely make it again. The mousse set up just fine for me. I think I took it out of the fridge a little early, because it was difficult to slice, but it still looked lovely.

The best strawberry tart ever. I have made this for entertaining since 2002 and have received nothing but awesome reviews. It is my husband's favorite tart/cake and he asks for it for his birthday every year. I use whip-it (Sahesteif) a white powder which helps keep the whipped cream stiffer. You can find it in the imported isle of some grocery stores like World Market. The flavors of the lime and white chocolate combined with the strawberries is a symphony for the senses.

I personally don't like white chocolate but my husband loves and he loved this recipe. I made 2 major changes. First, I cheated and bought frozen pie sheets that I just had to roll out. Cooking times were 20 minutes with weights at 350 and then 10 minutes without weights. Second, I used a white ceramic pie dish so that I did not have to transfer the pie. This dish is 10 1/2 inches wide. I also used 11 oz of white chocolate and melted them with a half cup of whipping cream. I did not have any leftover custard and did follow other reviewers suggestions to make sure that you whip the cream and egg whites separately until both are stiff. I also put on the strawberries only an hour before serving given we live in very humid climate.

When a dessert takes this much time to make, I expect it to look as good as it tastes. It WAS delicious; however, (1) the mousse didn't sit up enough in spite of its day/night in the fridge and (2) the strawberries yielded their juices immediately, resulting in a slightly runny top. I won't try this tart again, but if I did I would (1) not make it during humid weather, (2) add more and more stiffly whipped cream, and (3) place chilled strawberries seconds before serving, not two hours ahead of time.

I made this for Easter yesterday. It would have gotten 3 1/2 forks, except for a few things. As one reviewer said, you must watch the crust while it is baking. I baked it for the stated amount of time, and it came out slightly overdone. You could taste the burnt egg yolk in the crust, which was a slight turn off. Second, when you whip the cream for the mousse, make sure when it says "when peaks form" it is stiff peaks. The more you whip it the better the mousse will set. Third, when you take it out of the tart pan I would slide it onto a serving plate before cutting it. It is extremely fragile, and while cutting into it the topping slides a bit and the crust caved in. Maybe if it was on a more stable plate it would not have caved. Given that, it WAS delicious and I would make it again. It is just a very fragile dessert and needs TLC. Oh, and by the way, I disagree with other reviewers who said this was time consuming. I found it extremely fun to make and the time between the crust baking allowed me to clean up before the next step (making the mousse).

This turned out gorgeous! My crust fell apart as I was trying to transfer it to the tart pan but I just patted it into place and it worked out fine. Melting the white chocolate is so easy in the food processor! Just chop your chocolate into small crumbles in the processor then add your HOT cream in a slow steady stream. Done! Easy. The recipe makes a little too much mousse but just save some in a custard cup for a treat for later! Delicious!

This is one of the best desserst I have ever made. Everyone loved it, and I plan on making it again very soon! The only complaint I have is that it is quite time-consuming (but if you have the time, it is WELL worth it). Oh, and don't buy a ready-made crust - the buttery, crumbly crust in the recipe is one of the main reasons the dessert is so yummy!

Made this dessert after picking fresh strawberries this wknd. V. Good. It was a little time consuming..Read thru the entire recipe so you can decide if your day can accomodate some of the steps. I have a very similar recipe that uses raspberries on top. This is a dessert that can be transported-refrig. it after arriving, but none the less will stand up to a little traveling. Nothing worse than layers sliding, etc. after a day in the kitchen! Consider doing a red, white and blue topping for the 4th! Great Dessert for a show-off event. You will be asked for the recipe!

This is a lovely dessert and is usually a crowd pleaser because almost everyone likes chocolate and strawberries. This last time I made it, I wasn't able to add all the mousse to the crust without it spilling over, so I ended up having to throw some of it away. Just be sure to add it carefully so it doesn't run over the sides.

Also not wanting to use raw eggs, I substituted the filling from the "BLUEBERRY-WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE TART" (Bon Appetit July 96). It was excellent. The crust in this recipe was tricky to work with (and I only baked for 24 minutes) but it came out picture perfect. Once I put it in the pan, I repaired breaks with water, and it was seamless after baking. However, the texture was less pastry-like and more like a cookie. It was good, and fit with the other flavors and of the tart, but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. If you use the alternate filling as I did, it will still have a creamy, mousse texture and it sets-up marvelously.

My whole family absolutly LOVED this dessert. It was fairly easy to make and looked stunning. The crust was great, and the rest was fantastic! Definitly a keeper!

The mousse really does need to sit over night and well into the next day. Put the strawberries on the next day about an hour before dinner. Delicious!

Made this one for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. Presentation was beautiful! WARNING: keep an eye on the crust because it doesn't need to bake for as long as the recipe states.

Good dessert, very beautiful presentation. Watch out when baking the tart, the time stated in recipe is too long. Crust dough was a little difficult to work with, and does anyone notice that the mousse calls for raw eggs that are not tempered with anything?? I happened to be pregnant so I used pasturized eggs. Not great the next day, so eat it up that day. Also, when taking it out of the fridge, cut ASAP as it tends to get vert soft very fast.

Great recipe except for the baking time for the tart shell. 25 minutes plus 20 more was much too long, most tart recipes suggest 15 minutes of blind baking with weights followed by 10-15 without the weights. I used this timing for my second try and was very happy with the result. My guest loved it!!!

Easy and tasty, but my filling tasted more like whipped cream than chocolate. Will try again using more chocolate. Had lots of jam/lemon juice combo leftover.

This is an excellent tasting and elegantly easy dessert. It has a good presentation and it will earn you many complements. I use Belgian white chocolate (Callebaut) with very predictable results. Transfer the dough carefully by rolling it on the pin, but don't worry if it tears. Just patch as needed with dough pieces. Use a fork's tines to crimp the edge after molding it with your fingers. Beware of the cooking time for the tart crust after the 25 minutes with the weights and foil. 15 minutes to 18 minutes is probably about right to prevent overcooking. Use white chocolate shavings after glazing as an additional final touch. Next time, I might try a mixture of white and dark chocolate mousses in a swirl pattern as a varient. It is very important to let the mousse set overnight prior to assembly. After assembly, return to the refrigerator, let the glaze set for at least 2 hours. Serve cold, as the mousse will start to run after 10-15 minutes at room temperature.

I really loved this - what a perfect "light" dessert for spring and summer. I received rave rviews, especially for the crust, so I will keep this as my crust recipe for any sweet tart. The chocolate flavor didn't come through on the filling, but still was delicious. My question - my filling was slightly grainy when tasted on its own. Any suggestions on what I did wrong? Thanks, and enjoy! Oh, and it made a beautiful presentation!

Absolutely Awesome! Brought this to a dinner party and people were asking to lick the plates! I didn't give the mousse quite enough time to set and didn't bother with the glaze but it came out absolutely perfect.

This dessert is a HUGE hit whenever i have dinner parties. I like making it because you can make it so far in advance that there is no immediate preparation when your guests are eating dinner. It's easy but SOOO elegant and yummy!

Took to families planning to finish with the berries there, but the berries got left behind! Fished out a can of crushed pineapple. Strained and put a dollop on each wedge - tasted great! Next time I'll make it with the berries. The crust IS delicate, have to be very quick lifting into the tart pan. Next time I'll try the previous reviewers recommendation to pat it in to the pan.

Fabulous!!!!! Beautiful and easy to make. Make this when you need to impress. Hints: don't over bake the crust (the crust is GREAT by the way) and don't use all of the jam, just enough to glaze.

This tart was absolutely delicious! It was such a hit during a big family get-together. The tart was beautiful, and it wasn't difficult to make. I especially enjoyed the buttery flavor and flaky texture of the crust, so I am now using that recipe for other tarts that I make in the future!!

This recipe is to die for! My only caution is to make sure you do not let any of the strained jam run down the sides of the tart as it will make the crust soggy. Also, the dough is very fragile. It worked better being patted in the pan then rolled out. I would make this again and again and again and again. Oh, one little hint- don't melt the chocolate in a pot, just chop it fine in the food processor. Bring the heavy cream to a boil and pour it in the bowl with the motor running. This way you will not have to wait the 15 minutes while it cools down. It works just as well.

Delicious! and looks wonderful too. My only concern was that the cream of tartar and egg whites did not come close to being stiff or dry; I mixed it all in anyways. Definitely prepare the day before to allow the mousse to set.

This was easy and beautiful! What a delicious crust, and it is very forgiving! Mine broke up as I put it into the tart pan, but pushed together very nicely. Definitely start it the day before, as it takes quite a bit of time for all of the steps, especially the crust. I've made it twice to rave reviews.

I took short cut and used a prepared pie crust. I also used raspberry jam instead of strawberry and added cinnamon & frangelico to make a sauce that I served on the side. Very light in flavor and easy to prepare.

A very tasty dessert. Followed the recipe to the letter. As an aside, there were some uncanny similarities between this recipe and the April 1996 cover recipe for STRAWBERRY-TOPPED LIME MOUSSE TART...

The taste of the white chocolate really comes through in this light and airy mousse. I added a bit of sugar to the egg whites to make them stiffer. The crust is also a very nice recipe.
