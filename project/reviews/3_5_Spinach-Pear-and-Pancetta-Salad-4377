The dressing in and of itself is delicious, but the pears in the salad add a lovely sweetness. My dinner guests raved and asked for the recipe.

This salad was fine, but needed something more. Toasted pecans or crumbled blue cheese might have helped.

I have to agree with others who posted that this was very unimpressive. The drippings combined with the oil made for a heavier, oilier dressing than my wife or I like. Definitely not a keeper

I made this for my husband and I and I liked it but my husband loved it. It is unique with the crisp pancetta. I thought the dressing needed more flavor.

I am a fairly novice cook, so pardon my ignorance but I just don't understand using bacon drippings in a salad, especially one that is light and crisp (maybe I read the directions wrong? oh well :) ). If I ever made again I would definitely substitute the dressing for a raspberry one or something lighter.

My family was unfortunately not impressed with this salad, although I had high hopes for it considering the other ratings. In fact, my husband, who usually would eat just about anything, told me NOT to make this salad again. I followed the recipe closely and put some walnuts and blue cheese on the table if anyone wanted to try them with the salad as another cook suggested. We'll stick with the salads I have found on this site that are excellent like "Spinach and apple salad with crispy almonds", and "Almond crusted goat cheese salad with raspberry dressing"

It was ok, the pancetta didnt do too much for it. Next time I would use bacon, if I even make this again. The dressing was alright with very little work. Also, maybe add some cherry tomatoes or some feta.

Big hit at Christmas Dinner. I am making again for Easter

I thought the pancetta would be too fatty or too salty but no...the salad is divine and a great accompaniement to any substantial main meal.

Loved this salad! Used suggestion of adding blue cheese and toasted walnuts and it was out of this world! Because of it's complexity, it's great with a simple grilled dinner.

I used Spanish Vinegar instead of Sherry Vinegar and it was still a great salad. I also omitted the radicchio. This was a huge hit!

This salad is wonderful, but it does give you onion breath! Just make sure that you're not eating it on a first date. I found the sherry wine vinegar at Whole Foods. This is one of the best salads I have ever eaten! Will definitely make it at my next party!

This is a wonderful salad. I use West Virginia thick sliced bacon instead of pancetta. Skip the raddichio...added chopped toasted walnuts and bleu cheese...it's a hit...everyone loves it!!

I made this recipe for a bunch of picky eaters and they all surprisingly loved it! I used bacon and made the dressing the day before which as said by a previous cook, allowed it to mellow out. I served the dressing on the side and left out the radicchio(it wasn't missed).

This was a great addition to the Thanksgiving table and a wonderful departure from all the starches! I threw it together at the last minute with what I had on hand (bacon and whole grain dijon mustard instead of pancetta and dijon mustard) and it was terrific.

Love this recipe! I tried making a different salad for Thanksgiving last year and was booed at the table. I use Seckle or Forelle pears if I can find them.

This salad was delicious. The dressing mellows nicely if you make it a day ahead. I substitued white wine vinegar and it was fine. Requires an enormous bowl to hold all of the salad comfortably, but six adults polished it off (with tiny helpings to 4 kids, who did not care for it).

This salad is tasty and colorful.

Williams-Sonoma is my source for Spanish sherry vinegar. Try them on the internet. I've learned to keep 2 bottles on hand. One in use, one in supply. I think I've seen another brand in a gourmet type grocery store (Beyerly's).

I REALLY like this salad. But I am out of sherry vinegar - where can I purchase some? Please help. Thanks

Great! I used Asian pears and would suggest to use these unless you cannot find them. They are so crispy and perfect in the salad. My guests loved it!

As far as I'm concerned, anything with pancetta is bound to be good. My family laughed when I told them that I made this recipe because "100% would make it again". As someone who is domestically disabled (I passed Foods 9 only after I swore an oath never to enter the kitchen again), I figured that even I couldn't possibly mess it up. And I was right. This recipe is easy, attractive and full of interesting flavors. It made me look damn good!

A big hit at our office Christmas brunch. It want very well with both the "breakfasty" dishes and the more "lunchy" foods. I used Asian pears and found that they definately needed to be peeled. They didn't have an intense pear flavor... can anyone tell me if this is typical, or were they just not ripe enough? Had many requests for the recipe, and many new converts to Epicurious!

Made for Thanksgiving and it was devoured in less than 5 minutes by our guests (the entire bowl of it!!). That's one of the best compliments a cook could have!

Just fabulous! I added a bit of crumbled blue cheese which added a nice flavor contrast against the pears. The dressing is great and nice to be able to make ahead.

I rarely rate these recipes but HAD to do this one. Made for Thanksgiving (like 80% of others!) and got nothing but raves. Took to a girlfriends dinner party (a gourmet chef herself) and her spouse ate 3 helpings of salad so couldn't eat the dinner she had slaved for hours on. This is now going to be my "standard" spinach salad.

Fantastic! I served this at a dinner party with friends and they all asked for seconds. I gave the recipe out and they used it at a Christmas Eve gathering to rave reviews. I used bacon instead of pancetta and less oil-more vinegar.

I made this recipe as the salad course for Christmas Day dinner. While I really love the contrast of ingredients for the salad, the dressing needed to be tweeked. With half my family in the kitchen, everyone had a taste of the dressing and all thought it was too bitter so, I added 2 tsp of Cream Sherry and 2 tsp of honey to take the bitter after taste away and everyone loved it.

This salad is so delicious - I passed dessert to finish what was left after Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it. I've made it since and substituted bacon and a pippen apple in place of the pancetta and pear which was equally good. The bitter, salty, and sweet flavors of the salad are all complimented by the mustard and thyme in the dressing.

Rating: 4
The bite of the vinegar against the sweet pear and crunch of the pancetta is great. Served this as the first course on Thanksgiving, rave reviews all around. I used baby spinach and was able to find the sherry vinegar. Easy and elegant, you can make the dressing up in advance. I'll make this one again.

A wonderful salad that I honestly didn't expect to taste so great! Made it for Y2K-eve dinner, and it was certainly elegant enough, although I'm sure it would be just as good with a cook-out dinner. The flavours are very balanced and have an unexpected contrast to them. It is very important not to over-crisp (that is burn) the pancetta, though...

I love this salad. I often make it for company and everyone seems to really enjoy it. All the flavors come together well. I recommend using Asian perars if they are available; they cost a little more but they are so delicious.

This is my absolute favorite salad! I made it for 20 people last Thanksgiving and had to give the recipe to ten of them. Everyone loves it! Don't use red wine vinegar instead of Sherry...the Sherry vinegar is key!

Rating: 3
Our guests were impressed with presentation and flavor. Can substitute Sherry vinegar with red wine vinegar. Place raddichio around edge of individual plates and place salad in center. Fanning of pear slices on top nice if you have time.

The dressing is sooo good!

This dish was very well-received at my father's New Year's party. Use country dijon with the full grains.
