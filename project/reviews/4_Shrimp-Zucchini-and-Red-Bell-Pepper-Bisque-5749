Amazingly simple. Used Penzey's seafood stock instead of clam juice... ate as a main course with bread to sop up broth. Used a form to keep shrimp mixture and the wow factor is amazing. We had chilled a Crement, such a perfect pair!

This recipe was unbelievable! It takes a little bit of skill to pull off, but it was totally worth the time/multiple pots. The key to using the full amount of veggies is to cut them into matchsticks and time the cooking of them so that they and the shrimp are definitely still a bit underdone before you ladle the hot soup over them. The shrimp will continue to cook and the veggies will soften slightly, so you have to make sure they are all cooked correctly. I used 1.5 lbs of shrimp and their shells. Awesome.

I forgot to add that I only included a small zucchini and 1/2 of a large red pepper and included 1.5 lbs of shrimp...also based on other reviewers that the veggies were overpowering. It completely worked...I might add some shallot to it next time.

I made this for our NYE party, served in small glasses. It was a HUGE hit! Based on other reviewers I added a few dashes of hot sauce to add some spice plus I threw in a couple dashes of ground ginger. Gave it great flavor and it simmered on the stove for about an hour before I served it and I think that helped the flavors meld even more. Will definitely make this again!

My husband made this for a dinner party this past weekend. Wow! It was fantastic. He left out the zucchini and added a few drops of hot sauce (Red Hot) It looked great and tasted even better.

I had my doubts initially, but this is really good, and makes a lovely presentation. I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the zucchini. I added a quarter teaspoon of ground cayenne, which I think was a successful addition, and I substituted finely ground white pepper for black pepper. I used frozen, homemade clam juice, which is a little more briny than the usual bottled stuff. Also used frozen, homemade shrimp stock instead of water. I tasted the soup shortly before adding it to the shrimp and bell peppers, and I was disappointed, but once all the elements are combined the finished soup is great. Will definitely make this again.

Good, not great, too many veggies watered down the seafood flavor. Will make adjustments next time.

I have made this almost every year at the holidays since it first appeared in the December 1998 issue of Bon Appetit. In my opinion, it is delicious as is and does not need hot sauce as other readers have mentioned. To shorten prep time I buy raw peeled and deveined shrimp that still have the tails on and then just cut the tails off to use in the broth (instead of buying shrimp with the whole shell in place and then having to remove it - takes too much time). This is one of my all-time favorite soups.

I have now made this twice. It is just as good as the first time. It made a great starter/soup for Chritmas dinner of Prime rib. The presentation is wonderful. All guest will be clambering for the recipe.

I followed the previous reviewer's advice and skipped the zucchini and added hot sauce. I also made a broth from crab shells and used this in place of the clam juice. The result was just excellent and my guests just raved about it.

I would make this a 4 fork, with the following change: Add Louisiana Hot Sauce to the ingedients, otherwise this is lacking in any WOW sensation. I make this at our restaurant, but forget about the zucchini, and add the Louisiana Hot Sauce to the Bisque Mixture. Gets rave reviews.

We had this with the zucchini pancakes with chive cream also on this site - a fabulous combo!

I used crab legs instead of the shrimp, made the stock with the crab shells and my husband loved it! Being able to make it a day ahead made preparation a snap!

A delicious soup. A little time consuming, but if you begin the day before, the preparation is quite easy and the flavors are out of this world. Well worth it.

a bit tedious to prepare but worth the effort

This soup is rich and special - great first course for a special occasion, and really not that complicated and time consuming when you make the liquid part the day before, reserve the uncooked shrimp meat, then saute it with the zucchini & pepper just before serving. In the future, I plan to use less butter as the soup took on an oily look when I served it. It has enough rich flavor from the madeira to do without all the butter called for.
