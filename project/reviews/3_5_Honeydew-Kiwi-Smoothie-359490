This is very refreshing and the tartness of the lime & kiwi are mellowed out by the sweetness of the melon and honey. I like my smoothies a little on the thin side so I added 1/2 cup of lime sparkling water and it was delicious!

not having kiwi in season, I tried the following (large quantity) variant, and loved it: 1 seedless watermelon, 1 canteloup, 1 honeydew, a dash or two of maple syrup, juice of 4 limes, a small bag of ice. Pulverize fruit, lime juice and mint in the food processer in batches, and pour into a large punch bowl. Using some of the fruit mixture to get the ice started, crush the ice in batches in a blender, and add to the fruit mixture. Add maple syrup to taste. Allow to sit at least 30 minutes in the fridge so that the flavors blend.

I tried this recipe and after awhile some ingredients settled to the bottom. So what I did was, shake the tightly sealed bottled and you guessed it right. It tasted as good as I made it hours ago. Niiiiiiice :)
