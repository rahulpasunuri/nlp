Simple. Delicious. We all loved this. And it did NOT stick to to my non-stick pan (I used grapeseed oil as I normally do). This will become a regular!

Um... SO GOOD! I made a few adjustments: couldn't find watercress so I skipped the salad, but I kept the avocado -- and I couldn't find bulk peppers and didn't want to buy a package of 4 peppers just to use 1, so I just used crushed red pepper (found in African markets). I reversed the battering order - egg, parm cheese, THEN flour, the egg was thick enough to actually cover the cheese and then keep the flour sticking to it. I also used enough olive oil to thickly coat the pan and fried until golden on each side. Delicious! When done, I cut up the avocado into chunks, and sprinkled a little parm cheese, salt, and a couple good pinches of crushed pepper plus a Tbsp of the remaining olive oil and tossed with a fork. I served it with seasoned green beans. We ate the spicy avocado mix with the fish - I'm glad I didn't mash it into a guacamole, the full texture of the chunks was nice with the fish. Topped with a sprinkle of lime! My husband loved it.

Whoever said it would stick to the pan, you were right. The fish was good because the Whitefish I used was very fresh, but the recipe itself was not too exciting.

I was scepticle as to how I could fry fish covered in parmesan cheese in a pan without it sticking. I tried it and needless to say, I should have listened to my instincts. It stuck to the pan & I had to finish it off under the griller. Do yourselves a favour and follow the instructions until you reach the part where you fry it in a pan. Put it under the griller instead and voila! beautiful, fluffy fish. Use some foil & there is no dirty pan with stuck on cheese to clean.

I made the fish part and instead of serving salad I served boiled rice, it came out very tasty, simple recipe for busy work nights. My husband love the salty flavor the parmesan rendered the fillet.

I made this recipe in minimal time and it was a hit. I actually deviated from the recipe by omitting the flour (realized I didn't have any, last minute--yikes!), so the dish might be even tastier than we found it to be. My white fish fillets were thin so cooking time was only ~2 mins per side. Give it a try!
