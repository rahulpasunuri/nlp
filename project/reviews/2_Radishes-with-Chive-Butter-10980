This was awful. No matter how much additional chives, lemon zest, or tabasco I added, it still tasted like a hunk of butter on radish.

I am not sure if I will make this exact recipe. The flavors were pretty good, but needed something. I will probably tweak it with blue cheese or olives. The filling was too stiff and it burst out of the pastry bag! I ended up just spreading it on the radishes with a knife. This is no small feat given how slippery the filling is. By the time I got the filling on the radishes, it was a soft gooey mush. Maybe the trick is to let the filling get extremely soft, pipe it on the radishes, top with parsley,chill until firm, then serve. Warm butter and cream cheese is not appetizing.

I left out the butter & parsley, just used low cal cream cheese mixed with some blue cheese. The rest of the recipe is fine. Very easy and can be prepared a day before.

I made this for a Christmas appetizer and it was delicious! Was easy and a hit with everyone. I made the filling and piled it in the middle of a pretty plate with the radishes around it.
