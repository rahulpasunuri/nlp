This wasn't terrible, it just wasn't particularly interesting. I expected a lot more based on the reviews. I have a bunch left over, and I think I will try adding a little vin cotto or pomegranate molasses to give it more zip.

This was so tasty! There was some caramelization on the bulb and a little crunchiness on what was left of the stalk on the wedges. I used pre-crushed/minced garlic and this was so easy. It was even better than I'd imagined.

Made this as part of my Thanksgiving menu and it received raves. In fact, I'd doubled it (we were 14) and there were no leftovers at all. Delicious!

OMG!!!!!! I have made this no less than 5 times. Preparation is minimal and the results are incredible. Elegant enough for a dinner party but perfect anytime. The flavors are superb. Even better the next day......if you are lucky enough to have any left over.

I added spicy chicken sausage to make this a main course. Great!

This was my first making fennel and it was a great discovery. Made the recipe as is and it was just great. It was even better the next day!

This dish is so delish! I've made it twice and haven't used the crushed red pepper, but I've added herbs such as dill and oregano. The end result is addictive, I could munch on this stuff like french fries! Tonight I added it to a salad with clementines and avocado and it was divine!

Brought this to Thanksgiving, and it was delicious!

I didn't think I'd like this much, because I don't like the taste or smell of licorice, but this dish was incredible. Roasting the fennel totally changes the taste, nothing at all like licorice. This recipe takes almost no time to prepare, yet the overall effect is complex. I also found it took less time than indicated to roast. Will be buying fennel again!

Bursting with flavor - sweet, hot, bold, and spice- filled. There was so much going on. Great experience.

This was fabulous as one of the side dishes on Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Have made many times since then. A keeper!

I had never cooked fennel before & after trying this recipe, I'm a convert. I made it JUST like the recipe & really enjoyed it!

This was incredibly savory. I omited the crushed red pepper since I was serving to a 6 year old. I also had to substitute green olives for the Kalamata. STILL... it was an exceptional dish. It did not convert my husband to liking fennel so the search continues. I will make it again very soon, and I will serve it for company as well.

this is outstanding. It takes virtually no effort, and results in a dish that reminded me of the fabulous antipasto you find at only in Italy.

Easy, easy, easy and is a wonderful flavor. Had this as one of the sides for Thanksgiving and there was nothing left though I made enough for twice the number of people we had!

Wow - this was definitely the winner this year for Thanksgiving. Didn't have a big enough oven, so essentially 'caramelized' on stovetop in heavy pan. The olives really gave an unusual but delicious flavor. Nice and rich.

The prep was more time-consuming than I thought it would be and the results weren't worth the effort. Also, it cooked quite a bit more quickly than the recipe suggested.

This is an incredibly easy recipe and is a great side dish. Very flavorful, I would suggest care with the salt as it seemed a bit salty to us.
