Great recipe - we make this all the time! Serve with halved cherry/grape tomatoes. Also, we omit the salt and increase the pepper.

Don't make the mistake I did and put in 2/3 cup of pre-grated cheese. It was way too salty and I had to add more basil and nuts to absorb the salt.

Really quick and simple. Served it with extra thick (2inch) pork chops. It was easy to cook with the boys. The only comment I would make is that I used 1/3 cup more pesto. What the recipe calls for is just not enough.

I gave this review 2 forks but only because I thought the pasta needed more than 2/3 cup pesto to 1 lb pasta. I tasted it after adding 2/3 cup and it was bland. When I added more pesto, it was very tasty and I would rate it 3 forks.

This was great. I used the entire pesto recipe for a pound of pasta though, but reserved some to cook with chicken breast as seasoning. Could have fed many, and tasted wonderful

Hmmm.... everyone else seemed to love the pesto recipe. I haven't used this recipe, but it seems right to me.

this was disgusting. I will never make it again, especially the pesto.
