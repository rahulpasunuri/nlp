The recipe sounds delicious, but we don't love red peppers. Do you think it would work if I replaced it with sundried tomatoes, or even artichokes? Any other suggestions? Thanks!

We love tuna steaks. I thought the olive spread was good also, but the olive spread overpowered the delicate taste of the tuna. The spread would make a great hors' douvres on crackers.

Wasn't crazy about this dish. I don't understand, how many cans of tuna equals two steaks? I didn't see any conversion on the can. Also, it didn't stay together, it fell apart. Next time, I am thinking about putting some egg and breadcrumbs into the mix to keep it together, any otner ideas?

I added 6 olives instead of 5(as i love them)....should have sticked with 5...and i think my plum tomatoe should have been a bit bigger..aside from those errors I think the sauce has all the wham and taste!....Will try again and serve with a sprige of thyme, a few roasted potatoes or polenta with a tasty side of greenbeans ...keeper

The vinaigrette is awesome. We serve the fish with roasted potato wedges, which are also great with the vinaigrette.

YUM, YUM, YUM...I don't know what the person from NY did to it, but it's fantastic. I've made this several times with different fish and chicken, also, and once for a party of 30 people (tuna that time!) Never fails to impress!

Absolutely fantastic dish!! My husband loved it and keeps asking me to make it again. You have to like olives to enjoy this. This one is definitely in our list of keepers.

Delicious! I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I used green olives instead of black and left out the scallions & peppers -- I don't like red pepper anyway. Also, I didn't wipe out the pan before warming the dressing. It seemed like such a waste of flavors. Since the sauce was strong, I served it underneath the sliced fish instead of on top. The cooking time might have been okay for a thicker cut. Mine was 1 inch. 4 minutes on each side gave me a perfect medium -- pink, no red. I disagree that this sauce would be good for any white fish. I think it would overpower a lot of white fishes. This is not a delicate sauce. It was perfect with the tuna, though.

I disagree with everyone. This recipe is a great way to ruin a delicious piece of fish. It seems to bring out the "fishiness" of the tuna. Also, the cooking time stated in the recipe was too long and dried out the fish. It might be a good sauce for some other meat but not for fish.

Great recipe! I used sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. This sauce would be good on any white fish.

This is one great recipe and easy to make. I served it with Jasmine rice and a vegetable side dish. The 97 Foris Vineyard Pinot went well with this dish.
