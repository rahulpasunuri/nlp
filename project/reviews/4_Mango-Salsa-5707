I loved this as a base, a canvas to build on. Added: jalapeno for bite, red pepper for color, vidalia, NO oil, minced fresh mint leaves, smidgin of honey, a splash of pear infused white balsamic, some Jardines Peach Salsa - not a lot...gently. I'm not a fan of cilantro. Lots & lots of fun to build from this excellent base.

If you don't like the texture of the red pepper they can be easily peeled with a regular vegetable peeler.

I added fresh pineapple and a little sugar and served it over fish. It was delightful.

This is a really good, simple salsa. For an alternative, that is great served warm over fish, try this: http://imunchie.com/thisheartdreams/munchies/warm-mango-salsa

I forgot....I also added finely chopped jalapeno. Can't serve salsa in Texas without chili peppers.

Made this salsa for an "Appetizers Only" dinner party and it was a BIG hit. So easy to make too!! Served it with rice chips, instead of the usual corn chips, tostados or crackers. Was somewhat inexperienced in how to select the right mangos but an internet search solved my problem. Will DEFINITELY make again.

This salsa was PHENOMENAL! My husband and I made blackened Mahi-Mahi fillets and spread this on top...AMAZING! We like some kick in our food to brighten the flavors so we added a small, diced Thai chile and could not have been more pleased! Great recipe!

Terrific although would recommend substituting tomatoes for the red pepper and I used a small red onion which worked well. John Brigden

Added roasted corn, created a nice sweetness. Go easy on the salt, it doesn't act well with the mango. Delicious nonetheless. Worthy of a try.

i made this to serve with the filipino london broil and i don't think it was a good match. i added some jalepeno's and left out the oil and while it was a good salsa, it didn't knock my socks off. i think it would be better with fish or chicken so will try that next time.

Liked it a lot. Added avocado for the grown-up version and left it off, as well as the onions, for the kids version. My 4 and 7 yr old liked it very much

Very good! Made with tomatoes and red onion instead of bell pepper and green onions. Also added one jalapeno and left out the olive oil! Served with cod, brown rice and steamed asparagus. It was a fairly quick, easy, and healthy dinner!

Very tasty, made as directed about three hours ahead. A good mix of flavors and textures.

Really tasty - but was missing SOMETHING - I can't put my finger on what - I feel like one little change and this would be perfecto- Went perfectly with the Filipino London Broil.

I used parsley, rather than cilantro, as suggested. I also added a few leaved of pineapple mint--wonderfu!!!

Quick, easy and savory. I used parsley in place of the cilantro as I'm a bit adverse to cilanto... very delicious and flavorful!

I recommend adding an onion and some garlic and substituting the bell paper for tomatoes. The bell peppers' texture is quite jarring in contrast to the softness of the mango.

So tasty! My boyfriend LOVED this salsa. I served it with Macadamia Nut & Lime Crusted Mahi Mahi - perfect match. We used the leftover salsa on quesadillas the next night. So simple, too.

this recipe was an excellent starting point...I added minced serrano peppers and used one finely chopped red onion instead of green onions, also omitted the olive oil.

Loved this salsa. Added a can of drained black beans and a 71/2 oz of canned corn. Spectacular!

We LOVED this! I did halve the recipe, and felt that I could have used less cilantro. Would definitely make it again.

Can something this delish & easy be legal? Bunco devoured this as a dip. Tres fab! But would be lovely with pork or with any meat. Better than Whole Foods Mango Salsa! But this is worth the effort to whip it up!

I mixed this with an equal amount of commercial tomato salsa and served with chips. Big hit!

Added 1/2 chopped jalepeno and omitted oil. Perfect accompaniment to grilled salmon steaks. Even my almost 2yo daughter ate it up.

Great recipe - have made it lots of times, but never with the oil - it's really not necessary and without it, it is completely healthy (until you eat it with a whole bag of tortilla chips!)

Exactly what I was looking for. Did follow others' advice and add some jalapeno for the needed kick. Served this with Cheryl and Bill Jamison's Spice-rubbed pork chops from this site. It made for a pleasing weekend family dinner.

I served this as with grilled mahi mahi. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a minced jalapeno. My family loved it. Very refreshing on a hot summer evening.

I have made this recipe 4 times with the Bombay Sliders on this site. The mango salsa alone is easy and incredible, but along with the Bombay Sliders...out of this world. Guests have raved about it each time. I highly recommend the combination!

This was delicious and very colorful. I would have given it 4 forks if the jalapeno was included in the original recipe. I also added salt and a clove of minced garlic. We served it over grilled chicken that had been marinated in olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, garlic and jalapeno peppers.

I've also added black beans and served with tortilla chips as well as corn chips. YUM!!! Can't wait to try it with pineapple and with pork!

Really easy. I would definitely take the suggestion of adding a seeded jalapeno or other hot chile. Also, make it at least one hour ahead.

Love it! I used somewhat unripe mangoes for a crunchy texture. Excellent with grilled fish.

Very good. I added about a cup of chopped pineapple and 2 Tbl. of mexican hot sauce. If you throw it in the food processor it makes a great spead for spicy pork.

This was delightful. I too added jalapeno and it gave it a nice little kick. My family's only complaint was that I didn't make enough of it!

Jalapeno is must for this dish. I make it frequently and serve it with grilled mahi-mahi or grouper. This has been a mainstay for me for years. If I serve it to a crowd, I have to hide it from everyone till it goes on the dish it intended for! They want to eat it with chips ... or just eat it.

Ha! OK- diced up a banana, added ancho chili powder....if I only had a little coconut and coconut milk!

We added some jalapeno and served it over grilled Dolphin. Also had tortilla chips with it. Loved it, will make again.

I have been using this recipe for about 5 years! I add jalepeno (2 minced) and/or a tiny bit of habenero if we want it really hot! It goes with just about any meat. And once, when I was living at home for the summer my dad ate the leftovers on bread as a sandwich!

Ditto the previous comments. I used 1/2 fresh pineapple, chopped red onion and added a little jalapeno. The pineapple cut some of the sweetness of the very ripe mango. Yum!

Throw in a fresh chopped jalapeno, and instead of two cups mango, use one cup mango, one cup papaya. Lovely.

As if this salsa really needed any more glowing feedback, here goes; fruity and light, perfect for dipping or an accompaniment to something spicy. I'm serving it with an Indian curry.

Nice, fresh taste. Could use a little more "heat". Add 2 tsp. finely diced fresh jalapeno pepper.

Yum Yum! I would do this again. I only modified it with ~.5 teaspoon of soy sauce. We had in over grilled tuna with lime butter, yummy!

This was a sweet and tangy addition to my grilled mahi mahi. I loved the combination of the jalepeno and the sweet mango. I used a little more jalepeno b/c I like the heat. This was delicious and turns an ordinary meal into something special.

Fabulous and very easy...I too added minced jalapeno and used red onion rather than green. Served it with Glazed Grilled Salmon from this site and my guests were licking their plates. A real keeper!

This is great as a side, especially with cajun chicken or salmon. I added some finely chopped jalepeno peppers and extra coriander. You may also want to add a splash of wine vinegar. I would suggest using mango that is not too ripe because it is then too sweet.

Served this with grilled salmon and shrimp and it was a big hit with my guests! I plated the salmon steaks, then placed a small spoonful of mango salsa on top of the salmon, and then arranged two large shrimps on either side of the salsa. Made an impressive/colorful plate. I didn't put a lot of salsa on the fish because I wasn't sure how it would go over. Each of the guests asked for additional salsa before finishing their fish, so I took that as a winner! Also, I added half a jalapeno for a little kick (seeds and all).

This was wonderful! I served it as an hors d'oeuvre with some blue corn chips and it was a hit. I will make it again for sure. I'm planning to try it with salmon as one person suggested below.

Served with salmon and it was a big hit with my guests and adds a really nice dash of color to the plate. I think I'll play with the ingredients a bit next time and try some of the other mango salsa recipes on this site for variety - but overall this was an excellent base recipe.

I enjoy being a bit deviant. I added very finely chopped Ginger and subbed the Bell Pepper with a Jalapeno. The Ginger ought to be really finely chopped. Also used a bit of Honey to balance out the flavours. I served this with a Pyramid of Shrimps... Total success.

This is a great recipe...I've been making it all summer with one change (maybe two)...I add a jalapeno pepper to it. Yum! Also, when I have no green onions I've used red with very good results.

Great on grilled salmon over chipolte and white cheddar mashed potatoes. Throw some fresh greens around the edge of the plate and you have a beautiful plate. Plus it is fabulous on chips.

Wonderful flavor; nice mixture of sweet and tangy. I used refrigerated mango slices with the juice rinsed off - made the whole process very simple - and the perfume of the salsa alone could make a grown man weep with joy.
