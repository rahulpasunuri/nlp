SO delicious! i think the key to this is good quality fish & vegetables.

That is really good, very refreshing. I used a Japanese eggplant, as they were local fresh. And yes, you do need the aoili.

Super easy, just the thing in summer. This took no time to prepare and was tasty, although not the most "wow" fish dish I ever made. I think the fact that I made aioli from scratch was critical to its success (the dish needed generous dollops of aioli to jazz it up, so homemade was critical).

Easy and delicious... am always surprised how long eggplant takes to grill -- be patient! Skewered the cherry tomatoes for easy grilling. Also cut up a red pepper. Used garden-fresh herbs (thyme, tarragon, basil, oregano & rosemary) along with some fennel seeds, and drizzled in some 18 yr (syrupy) balsamic. Would definitely make again. Looking forward to my lunch of leftovers. Don't forget the aioli (1/2 cup of mayo, 2 tbs olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 cloves of garlic, and 1 tbs lemon juice).

This is a great recipe. I made everything on the stove top and it still turned out fabulous!

Excellent dish. I used Ahi Tuna since there was no Albacore available. Cooked a chicken breast for my friend who doesn't eat fish and she loved it with the Aioli and veg. I thought the Orange scented couscous was extremely bland and would do my own recipe next time. Otherwise, an excellent dish.

Wonderful dish. No albacore available so we used wild alaskan salmon with great results. Definitely make the aioli, even a tiny bit makes the dish rich and wonderful!

This was easy to prepare in a short amount of time and tasted delicious. Skipped the couscous and served it with bread. Aioli is important.

This was amazing. My husband said it was one of the best dishes he's ever had. I was tempted to skip the aioli, and was very glad I didn't. It was so easy and so tasty. We dipped the fish and the grilled veggies in it. We used the leftover couscous in the suggested Moroccan Chicken Salad with dates and mint. It was really good, too. We also used the leftover aioli and tuna in sandwiches.
