Easy and very good recipe that can be made up to 48 hours before enjoying it. For our European palate though (we are a French-German family),it was however way too sweet. I would reduce the sugar to 1/8 of a cup to truly bring out the full flavor of chocolate. The cardamon creme anglaise was a hit too - with a bit less sugar as well! Sugar covers the taste of natural ingredients, if you reduce it, you will bring out more flavors.

I love dark chocolate, but if I make this again I would lighten it up by using a slightly sweetened chocolate (instead of bittersweet). The cardamom creme anglaise is unbelievably delicious, and i've made it separate from the souffle for other chocolate desserts. But even with that served in abundance, i thought the souffle still needed to be a bit sweeter. The anglaise gives this rating an extra fork.

I wasn't as wowed by this recipe as other reviewers. I made the recipe base the day beforehand, which may have been problematic. Although it was subsequently warmed up to room temperature, it was very dense and difficult to fold into the egg whites. The batter only half-filled six 3/4 cup ramekins. It was difficult to tell when they were cooked. They ended up needing 22 minutes in a 350° oven. If I make these soufflés again, it will be in an attempt to improve upon the first time, not because they were that tasty. The cardamom creme anglaise was fantastic, absolutely top-notch.

I made this again tonight because we had a couple friends over for dinner, and this is the favorite dessert of one of them. I'd forgotten how much I like it myself. The Cardamom Crème Anglaise pushes an already great dessert into the top echelon of desserts Of note: The Crème Anglaise recipe makes too much for the souffles. The souffles have to cook for a lot longer than 12 minutes--more like 20 minutes at 350 in my oven.

i made four of them, and it took only two people and about ten minutes before they were gone.

This is a good recipe, I think I would prefer semi-sweet chocolate but this was still good. The cardamom creme is definitely what makes the dish.

Impressive. Super easy. Tasty. Creme Anglaise is essential. Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

This is the very first souffle I've attemped. Really terrific. One thing I learned is that the beating of the egg whites to form white peaks is essential - beat a little longer than you think is needed and increase the beating speed after the froth forms. The cardamom creme anglaise is wonderful, but I'm sure you could substitue any creme topping. If you use the cardamom topping, this souffle is a super ending to an Indian-inspired meal. Lastly, this is a perfect guest recipe because it can be made in advance and then baked after dinner.

This is the second souffle I've made, the creme was the icing on a very delicious souffle and I'll be making them again very soon

My first souffles and they came out beautiful and delicious! The cardamon creme anglaise added that special something. I also made them a second time using a strawberry creme anglaise which was also nice.

I made these to bring to a friend's house and they were very easy and quick to make, especially considering the results. I do think that the linked custard is what makes this dish though.

To the cook from London, generally when souffles are served in restaurants, the waiter will serve the souffle on a plate and the sauce in a sauce boat. You can then punch a hole in the top of the souffle and fill it the sauce

I am dying to try this but could some one please describe how the creme anglaise is served with the souffles? Little souffle dishes sitting in puddles of custard? I find it hard to picture. Thanks!

These souffles were really delicious, especially with the creme anglaise. The cardamom flavor really complemented the chocolate and brought the dessert to a whole new level. I made them for a dinner party and everybody loved them. I got credit for making a fancy dessert, when in actuality the recipe was about as easy as they come. I will definitely be making these again. (I didn't have 3/4 cup souffle dishes like the recipe called for, so I tried making them in both a 2/3 cup souffle dish and a 1 1/4 cup dish and they both turned out fine.)

This was the first souffle I ever made and it turned out easy and so very delicious! A must-have for my recipe box!

This is the best individual souffle I have ever made, not too sweet, and very easy. Guests rave over it, easy enough to prepare the base and sauce ahead and finish off at a freind's home, just as dinner is being cleared. Yum, I am addicted!

This was amazing. It was so easy and it was the best desert ever. Not too sweet. I served it with cinnamon whipped cream instead, which was good becase it needed someting light, and the cinnamon was a nice addition.

This dish was unbelievably delicious--decadent and simple and rich. It was my first souffle and very easy and quick. My husband is generally appreciative of my cooking, but he almost fell out of his chair with this treat. I caught him gazing at them later, trying to resist a second helping.
