While this dish was flavorful, the stiffness of the cream cheese was not pleasing to the texture of the dip. Probably wouldn't make it again, or would try to figure out a way to make it creamier.

This is delicious. I made as described, except in the rush I forgot to add the salt and pepper at the end. Went very well with crudites, crackers, and fresh veggies. Also what little was left over tasted wonderful cold the next morning. This recipe has made it's way to my "sure thing" list.

This wasn't bad, definitely better when we let it sit in the fridge for a day before we served it (I then warmed it up again in the oven before serving). I also didn't use the anchovy paste (vegetarian). We added more scallions and parsley too add crunch.

This sounds like a must try. I will be making this with some chicken wings. http://www.kwlifefull.blogspot.com/Thanks

Loved this dip and it will be something I will make again and again. Next time I might experiment with using shallots and letting them carmelize a bit. I also upped the anchovy paste, but that's just a personal preference. The other thing I did was that after I finished prepping it in the skillet, I scooped it into an oven-proof serving dish and let it sit in a 250 oven until my guests arrived. I think this step gave it a nicer consistency.
