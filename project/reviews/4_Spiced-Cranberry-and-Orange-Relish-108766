So different! Prior to this I had thought I did not like cranberries. I made it for my Thanksgiving dinner and a guest requested that I make it for her Christmas dinner as her whole family could not stop talking about it. That Works for me as it is about the simplest thing that I have ever made. Give it a try you won't be sorry.

As previously commented, this is quite sweet, but delicious. I tweaked the recipe in several ways: - Doubled the cinnamon and cloves; - Used 2 tsp. ground ginger instead of stem or crystallized (though I'd use those if I had them); - Added 3 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar at the end. These edits cut the sweetness and made the relish more brightly flavored.

this recipe is excellent!! instead of 2 navel oranges, i used 1 large clementine and added the ginger with all the other ingredients in the food processor.

This recipe is great. I use 1/3 cup rum to replace 1/3 cup of the water and throw in a handful of golden raisins. I have used a similar recipe for years with always rave reviews.

The flavor of this recipe was very good, but it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. I added more cranberries and orange to balance out the sweetness and it was great.
