Even with a pretested candy themometer this did not set right but did have a smooth flavor. I was planning on gifting these during the holiday season but couldnt cause the presentation and overall consistency was not there. Darn. I did eat the whole pan anyway, it was a sacafice LOL.

I am a very experienced candy maker with a digital thermometer. I made this recipe exactly according to directions, and just like almost everyone else the result was closer to a praline than a caramel after a few hours. I tried reboiling some of it with some corn syrup and it turned back into caramel, albeit a sauce. One thing it did have was great flavor. I used Pusser's Navy Rum. It's the ONLY dark rum I know that actually maintains great flavor in recipes. I recommend trying it instead of Goslings, Myers, et al. I'm not going to waste good ingredients on this one again.

Hey, call them what you will--butterscotch, caramel, praline...They are delicious. Some turn a little grainy, but the majority are slick and smooth. We love them!

I followed the recipe exactly. Caramel came out very soft, but tasty. By the next day, they were grainy just like a praline. So I told people that's what they were. They ate them anyway..and loved them. I may or may not make them again.

I added cinnamon with the extra rum and vanilla. Turns out, this is NOT a caramel recipe. It's would be more correctly called a butterscotch recipe with the brown sugar, low temp, and butter all added in from the start. Sugar caramelizes at 320 degrees F but this recipe calls for cooking the sugar only to 248 (firm ball). Next time I will find a real caramel recipe where the butter, rum and cream get added after the sugar is caramizled in water...

Here is some research I found on making caramels: "best made with 100% or some amount of pure, white granulated cane sugar, which will be clearly marked on the label. Brown sugar contains impurities that prevent caramelization, but you'll still see it in some recipes...Stir with wooden spatula or spoon over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves...occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. It is essential that all sugar completely dissolves before the sugar comes to a boil. This includes the sugar crystals that cling to the sides of the pan, otherwise the mixture will crystallize once it boils, turning the caramel gritty." Reviewers who complain of a gritty texture probably heated the mixture to a boil to quickly. Hope this helps others with success!

The flavor was really yummy, but mine also turned into a grainy, sugary, new orleane praline texture (also like maple sugar candy). But the flavor was so good I'd like to try again. I may stop cooking a few degrees short of 248 next time. In my Fannie Farmer cookbook, it also says to constantly wash down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals, which can turn the whole thing sugary. (This vaguely makes sense from what I remember in high school chemistry.) Does anyone else have tips on making caramels or candy? Oh -- also, I had no rum so I used Maker's Mark bourbon instead, and it was YUMMY.

The way to make this more "gooey" is to finish at a lower temperature than the recipe is calling for. Another caramel recipe in this website calls for finishing at 242 degrees F, which is soft and chewy, and you're not supposed to stir at the end. That's what's possibly making this recipe crumbly.

Disappointing--too sweet, not gooey enough, with barely a memory of the rum flavor. It's also too dry and crumbly (as several other reviewers have commented). I'm going to guess that part of the problem is the absence of granulated sugar. A stab at revising the recipe to the flavor and consistency I expected would be 1 c brown sugar, 1 c granulated, and 5-6 T butter. To increase the gooeyness and accentuate the rum flavor you could probably replace some of the brown sugar with molasses, too. But I'm not sure I feel like wasting any more ingredients to find out whether it would work.

I was so proud of my homemade caramel. While it was still warm, I put it on apples and it was delicious. After three hours, it was turning to sugar on the bottom. By the time I made my turtles and ate one, the caramel was completely sugar -- like a New Orleans praline. I obviously need more instruction! I've found some other recipes that I'll try next time.

These were amazing (I don't think I'm sharing with anyone who doesn't live with me and already knows about them).

I'm also at high altitude, so I checked my trusty Joy of Cooking on that - they say subtract one degree from the final temperature for every 500 feet above sea level, which I followed exactly. (i.e. I'm at 2000 feet, so I cooked it to 4 degrees less than directed.) Mine ended up a bit on the soft side, but were still quite acceptable. And tasty!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect. I make candy quite often and found this recipe very quick and easy. I cut it into bite size pieces and wrapped them in waxed paper wrappers. Tip: Make sure your thermometer is calibrated or better yet, use a digital thermometer. This will help avoid some of the problems that other reviewers had.

These are super easy and very tasty. Everyone I gave samples to LOVED them! I made these twice in the same weekend. The first batch turned out more like taffy, as mentioned by the other reviewer but I thought it was because I let them cool, uncovered, all night before cutting them. My husband loved them this way! The second batch I did not cook to as high a temperature so they were much chewier. The only problem was that half of it was perfect and the other half gritty. My grandmother could have eyeballed it and told me what I did wrong.

Did not waiver from recipe and watched temperature very closely. Had to freeze caramels to cut them and when I plated them, they pooled into one giant blob. Not sure what could have happened but not something I'd make again.

I thought it came out too soft and kind of gritty, I'm going to try it again, though. Any ideas how to make it more firm?

I was expecting these to be soft and chewy, but mine hardened to more of a toffee consistency. Maybe 248 degrees is too high for someone living in a "high altitude" area. Any suggestions?

Just a question before making these: it doesn't say anything about wrapping them. Do they keep without being individually wrapped?

I made two batches of these and offer them at work. Turns out to be a big hit. For my second batch I used Frangelico instead, and top 64 skinned hazelnuts on top before the caramel cools. You get a double dose of Hazelnut flavor in those.
