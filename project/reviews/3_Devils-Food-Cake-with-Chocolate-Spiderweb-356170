Cake texture was perfect (velvety) and the web/spider design was easy and great (guests loved it)! The frosting, however, was horrible. It was glossy and runny and needed quite a bit of espresso to really get the flavor. In the end, I made a whole new batch of frosting, using a different recipe.

This is a fantastic cake recipe. It can be used for cupcakes also. It's always been a hit. Don't over mix...that's the key.

The best part about this cake is the decor (spider and web). The frosting is too thin and sweet. The cake is a bit dry. Oh, well!
