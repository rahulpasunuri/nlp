I made two batches of this recipe yesterday, and the first batch was terrible: the chocolate separated from the base, and I think it did so because the base was way too well done (recipe indicates 30 minutes baking time). I baked it for 25 minutes, still too long. And the overall cookie was too sweet. Here's what I changed for the second batch: I used 1/2 cup of sugar to reduce the overall sweetness, and I baked the base for only 16 minutes (started at twelve minutes, added three minutes, and finally added one more minute). As one other reviewer suggested, I did use 8 oz of bittersweet chocolate instead of 6 oz and used Lindt brand white chocolate, which drizzled really well. The outcome was fabulous. Really tasty base, the chocolate did not separate, and they were much easier to cut. I will definitely make these again.

Super easy, fun, and so delicious! I made a batch Friday, and by Saturday night, they were gone. The family loved them.

Best Cookies I have baked so far. I have baked them about 20 times in the past 4 months and completely love them every time again. I enjoy baking them and not just for the holidays. Made 3 batches for a bake sale and they where sold out in 20 minutes. I completely adore these cookies!!!!!

Great holiday cookie! Very simple, quick, and tasty. Definitely a keeper. Will definitely experiment with some variations -- toffee bits, nuts, etc.

Love this as a twist on regular ol' peppermint bark. Made these today as little coworker gifts. I took suggestion of making it in a 10x15 pan and it only took about 10-12 minutes. Do watch these closely in the oven.

these are excellent but watch the cookie part. No way it takes 20 minutes to bake. More like 12 to 15. Very good, minty tasting cookie

It was so humid when I was trying this recipe, that the candy canes started to melt before I could crush them. So I tried it with toasted coconut. And then I put them aside for five days. And finally, I tasted them before they went into the freezer....SO GOOD! I'm sure that any topping you like (nuts, candies, fruit) would taste good on top of these cookies. They're crumbly, so sit somewhere were you dab up the crumbs.

the first baking compliment EVER from my mil,and these were so easy! kids loved smashing the candy canes and my white choc chips melted easy in the microwave. Just delicious!

I was hesitant to try this recipe because I wasn't sure how the peppermint bark would be with such a large shortbread base. It was absolutely delicious. Out of all the cookies I made during the holiday season, this was my favorite. It is such an easy recipe, and the bark comes out fragrant and tasty. I made no alterations to the recipe and had no problems with it. It's a good recipe if you need to whip up some cookies in a snap!

Tried this recipe lately with some hesitation. The last peppermint chocolate cookies I'd made had a toothpastey peppermint buttercream filling, so I wasn't sure if peppermint cookies were a good idea at all. I tried them because they looked so pretty in the picture, and I wanted something Christmas-y. I'm glad I gave it a chance. They're delicious, a perfect balance of flavors. They were also fairly easy to make.

Excellent holiday cookie. The peppermint and choc. are great with the very buttery short bread. I've made about 10 batches of these cookies during the holiday season this year and everyone has raved. Followed the recipe to a tee. Don't try to use white choc. chips to drizzle as they do not melt well. I found that a white choc. candy bar worked best.

Made this with bittersweet chocolate for the first time. It is FABULOUS! I will bring it to a company Christmas party and then make it again with dark semi-sweet chocolate. I want to get it out of my house before I eat the whole thing myself!!!

This recipe is wonderfully easy and so festive! I baked the shortbread on a 10 by 15 cookie sheet instead and reduced the cooking time by a few minutes. They turned out perfectly! The shortbread gave these cookies a toffee flavor and it was quite intriguing! They were a hit with both adults and children alike :)

This cookies were fabulous and really easy this is my second year making them, and I am not good with melting chocolate and had no trouble with these- happy holidays

This recipe was voted the "Best tasting Cookie" by 30 very discriminating female cookie testers out of 30 cookies tasted. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 12 by 17 inch jellyroll pan. The shortbread part was much thicker than the the picture shown with the recipe so I called it Peppermint Bark Shortbread instead. I thought this was an error in calculating the pan size but I read this happened with others who used the recipe too. I made the recipe 5 days before it was voted on and stored it per recipe.

I used white chocolate as the base and dark chocolate as the drizzle. Not a bad recipe...a little hard to flatten the dough though.

I thought these were OK, but everyone at work loved them. I like the shortbread from the chocolate-dipped shortbread recipe better.

These bars are delicious and easy to make, as well as an attractive addition to any plate of holiday cookies. Everyone liked them (unlike the triple ginger cookies featured in the same Bon Appetit article).I kept them in the refrigerator and they even taste good cold.

These little shortbread bars were absolutely great. Instead of the suggested candy cane pieces I used Andes Peppermint Crunch chips (not quite as strong as candy cane pieces) and wow! Definitely on the A-list!

SO FABULOUS!!!!! I made these for the holiday gifts we gave to my family. They were a hit!!! I made the shortbread base early and froze it. When I defrosted it to make the rest I heated it in a 500 degree oven until it was hot. Then I proceeded as the recipe said. FABULOUS!!!

These were relatively easy and a great, great success! I did use more chocolate (8 oz) and melted it first. The only thing I'll do differently next time is to use more candy and/or peppermint oil. I didn't have any trouble with the chocolate falling off, but I actually screwed up and forgot to chill them until about an hour after I'd put the chocolate/peppermint on top. No idea if that helped, but there you go.These are rich and fantastic!

These are awesome! I used the large bar pan from Pampered Chef and that was the perfect size for the dough. I did add 2 oz. extra chocolate. They broke apart beautifully and look impressive! And they're tasty!

These are awesome! I used the large bar pan from Pampered Chef and that was the perfect size for the dough. I did add 2 oz. extra chocolate but the white chocolate was plenty for a slightly bigger pan. They broke apart easily and looked very cool. No problem with the chocolate separating from cookie base. Very yummy!

After reading the other reviews I went out and bought a 10 X 15 inch pan--then I couldn't make the dough fit the pan and ended up putting it in a 9 X 13 inch pan. When it was all done I thought the thickness was just fine. I did add more chopped chocolate (about 10 oz. total and let it melt in a turned off oven for a minute or 2). The cookies were very well received and I thought they were delicious!

I am Alanya's oldest daughter, Rose. My mom made these fr a cookie swap at work and she says everybody loved them! I know that me and my younger sister did, too! And not only will we make it again, we are making it again. I cannot see any reason why this recipe would not be given at least 3 forks. (However, we did add x-tra chocolate!)

I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. THe dough was actually very wet. None of the separation problems (used mini semisweet chips i had in the house -- maybe that helped?). BUT I couldn't get the white chocolate to melt. It just globbed. Trying it again tomorrow to bring for Christmas as that didn't seem to be anyone else's problem.

It was really easy to make, visually appealing, and tasty. I melted the chocolate first before trying to spread it on the cookies.

This recipe is exceptionally easy. And it's a pretty presentation if the chocolate stays on. I had quite a few of my cookies break apart because the chocolate just didn't stay on. The shortbread crust was good but for whatever reason mine was really crumbly in texture. I'll try them again and see if it was my ingredients or the recipe, since my family did like the cookies.

Great cookie loved by all. Definitely a keeper! I did vary the recipe, given the comments from others about the dough being dry. I used my own favorite shortbread cookie recipe as the base and added 3 tsp peppermint extract to the dough. Instead of putting it in a pan, I rolled out the cookies and cut with star shaped cookie cutters. I also added a couple of teaspoons of peppermint extract to the chocolate, which I melted in a pan over hot water. Then, I followed the rest of the recipe per instructions. Mmm mmm good!

These are great. I also used a half-sheet pan instead of 9x13 to get the thin shortbread crust. Because the dough is a little sticky, we put a second piece of parchment on top to roll it out to an even thinness, using a small glass. We also melted the dark choc over the stove and spread it on which made it quite easy. It did require about 10 oz of chocolate with the larger pan and about 3/4 cup of crushed peppermint candy. 2oz of white chocolate was still enough for the accent. Taste is great!

I'm not sure what I did wrong that the rest of you did correctly, but I have very few pieces of this cookie in which the chocolate layer did not separate from the base. They taste very good, and I will serve them to family, but there is no way I could put these out for guests, etc. The chocolate will have to be held onto the base while being eaten; they are disappointing.

I made this recipe twice. The first time was alright, but that was my fault! I didn't follow the cooling directions of the recipe which resulted in stale cookies and broken pieces. I also used "middle of the road" chocolate. The second time I made this recipe it was fantastic. I followed the recipe and used High quality white and bittersweet chocolate. And I followed the chill instructions! They are delicious. I have been looking for a good bark recipe for years!

Easy to make. I used chopped peanut butter cups as a topping, plus white chocolate chips on top of semisweet chocolate (which kids loved).

Rating: 0
I followed the recipe as written and agree that making them in a 9 x 13 pan makes the cookie base too thick. I baked it for close to the recommended time (took them it out at 27 minutes) and they seem to be too dry. On my second batch I'll use a larger pan and will bake for less time. Like another reviewer, a couple of cookies had the chocolate top separate from the base, but seems a small problem. The flavour is nice and they were easy to make, just needs a bit of tweaking.

I also made these for a cookie exchange and luckily there were a few extras for me and my family to taste. I used a jelly roll-style pan too, but followed the rest of the recipe. My only problem was that cutting them into squares made a huge mess and broke many cookies into too small pieces. The way the recipe suggested you do it, cutting them into abstract shapes, would have been much better, but I didn't think that would look very good for a cookie exchange. Anyway, excellent cookie.

As someone else mentioned, I too used melted chocolate and spread it over the shortbread crust. It turned out wonderfully too. I only had unsweetened chocolate, so I melted it in a double-boiler, mixed about 1/4 c powdered sugar with it (and used 8 oz of chocolate instead of 6 oz). It gave it a nice dark-chocolate like taste. Then I sprinkled it with peppermint-flavored chips (like chocolate chips, only peppermint). Turned out wonderful.

On my first batch, the dough turned out really dry so I used some milk on my hands when patting it down on the cookie sheet. For any other cookie I would have thought I had overcooked it, but the dough turned out perfect! Crunchy, caramel-sweet and delicious. I would definitely recommend flattening out the dough as much as possible (my second batch was good, but a little thicker and didn't have the same taste). I also used a lot more chocolate: 12+ oz. of bittersweet and probably about 4-6 oz. of white chocolate.

I made these for my cookie exchange. I used a 10x17 pan and baked the first batch for 25 minutes. I also used toffee for the first batch instead of peppermint. When I had the white chocolate finally drizzled on, we tasted it and, bummer, we thought it was way too dry! So, I made the 2nd batch and baked for 20 minutes. I did this one with the peppermint. It tasted much better. What really changed the whole cookie was letting them sit overnight in the tray, outside. It was 28 degrees here in Ohio, so that's way colder than my refrig! The next morning, we tried them again. What a great cookie! even the toffee batch that was very dry was good. By the time I did the cookie exchange, it had been 3 more days. I had cut them and stored in containers outside the whole time. Time is a good thing for these delicious cookies. Both the toffee and the peppermint were ooohhhed and awwed over.

I don't know what was wrong with me today but I was apparently unable to follow a recipe. I baked them in a jelly roll pan (on accident) but took them out after about 20 minutes because they smelled done. I also melted the chocolate in the microwave and spread it on top once the cookie had cooled (because I wasn't reading the recipe) and in the end everything turned out great. Very festive and foolproof recipe. I think I would do it the exact same if I made them again. A 13x9 sounds like the cookies would be too thick.

Very pretty Christmas cookie. I used a jelly roll pan (10"x15") to made thinner cookies and baked for about 20 minutes. Some of the chocolate has separated from the shortbread, but most turned out fine. Delicious!

Great recipe, but I agree with the previous reviewer -- I felt like I undercooked the base, too (although it was still good!). Next time I'd bake it longer. And I used extra white chocolate to drizzle on top.

Rating: 4
They turned out lovely, although I think I may have undercooked them slightly (my own fault and not the recipe's). I used an extra couple of ounces of white chocolate, as 2 didn't seem like enough to keep the peppermint shards in place. They were pretty fun to make too; I felt like the Jackson Pollock of candy. When I make these next time, I'm definitely going to use less of the shortbread base, though, as they ended up very thick and square-like, rather than the cookies they appear to be on the picture.
