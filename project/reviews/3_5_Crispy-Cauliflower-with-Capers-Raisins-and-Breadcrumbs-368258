Followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used panko. Despite the addition of such savory ingredients like capers and anchovy paste, I thought this tasted bland, and didn't think the raisins added anything. I consider myself to be a beginner cook, so user error could be the problem!

Anyway you make this, it is awesome. And cauliflower isn't exactly my favorite vegetable, but this is great. Even if you just do the roasting it is good, but the accessories make it great. And I didn't even use anchovies - didn't have any.

Love roasted cauliflower and loved this preparation. Didn't change a thing except used Panko crumbs, reduced the amount of oil. I did use anchovy paste, which really adds depth of flavor. Next time I'll reduce the Panko to 1/2 C unless the cauliflower head is really large.

Fabulous! Tasty and very easy! Used slightly less olive oil than called for and substituted panko for breadcrumbs.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for using regular raisins (not golden)and capers (no salt-packed.)It was still great. The directions are very easy to follow; I have never made cauliflower before! My boyfriend who "hates cauliflower" had seconds. Go figure! I will definitely make this again!

Just made this tonight and it was terrific! I followed the reviewers who substituted Panko for the breadcrumbs...it was really divine! This is a keeper and will be making this again!

Loved it and didn't change a thing except the substitution of Panko for the fresh breadcrumbs. I made half just for the two of us and we nearly ate it all. Have to laugh at reviewers that leave out half of the flavor ingredients and then rate the recipe!!! Will definitely be making full batchs of this one again.

What a great way to eat cauliflower! i used panko bread crumbs. Next time i will cut up 3 heads of cauliflower cause 1 was no way enough for 4. and i will use all the head ..just cut into 2 inch chunks. i used a no oil no stick pan to cook the garlic and capers. roasted the cauliflower and turned the oven off, & left in oven till we ate ...like 4 hours later. Combined just before serving...so the bread crumbs stay crunchie,

I thought this recipe was excellent! I enjoyed the roasted cauliflower flavor and crunch of the breadcrumbs. Will definitely make again.

We made this for Thanksgiving and it was so good, I made it again tonight! Just read that you can toss it with spaghetti for a main dish. I think I'll do that with the leftovers (if I can keep them around that long!) as far as pans go, I don't know what others are talking about--I used a rimmed cookie sheet & an 8" sauce pan. Then put it all in a bowl. I didn't have anchovies so I omitted them and I used Panko breadcrumbs, because I love them!

This was a definite do again for our family! My husband doesn't care for cauliflower and actually liked it and wanted more. I too only used a baking sheet and pan. Although I also omitted the anchovy paste and capers because I do not care for them either. I am anxious to try this recipe on a larger group.

This was DELICIOUS. I would have been happy eating a big bowl of this for dinner. We will be making it again for Thanksgiving.

Followed the instructions and it was excellent and quite easy. I'm not sure what the other reviewers were referring to with all the pans and work. One sauce pan and one baking sheet was all that was needed. The salt-packed capers and anchovies add great depth to the dish. Will be making for thanksgiving.

I offer another opinion. I have to admit I didn't make it quite as written BUT it was a HUGE hit in my house ...and we are no big fans of cauliflower. I nuked the raisins in broth, I used bacon instead of anchovy because I don't like it and left out capers because again, I do not like them. I thought the dish had great texture, the breadcrumbs (dried foccaccia) were wonderful and the raisins gave a love sweet flavor. Have made it a couple of times now and love it!

This is way too fussy. I love cauliflower and I was really excited about making this, (especially since its in season now) but was totally underwhelmed. Lots of work for flavor that just doesn't come thru, and as someone else says, lots of dirty pans. I should have just roasted the cauliflower with olive oil and curry and kosher salt, which is minimal work with maximum yumminess.

Way too much work and too many dirty dishes for OK results. Raisins did not add anything to the dish.

Waaay overkill. A little more simple would have been just as good, if not better. Raisins simmered in broth and anchovy paste? Didn't get what it added to the flavor. Raisins were a nice sweet addition, however, didn't get the added flavor of anchovy. When I roast cauliflower again, I will stick to oliver oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Maybe, throw in some breadcrumbs.
