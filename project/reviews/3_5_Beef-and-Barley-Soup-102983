I've made beef and barely soups many times, my advice here to people getting pasty/stew like results: Cook the barely separately in water, and DO NOT MIX IT IN the soup. Spoon the barely into bowls then ladle soup over. Do not store the cooked barely in the soup either. This REALLY helps prevent the barely from eating up the liquid soup you worked so hard to get.

I used filet mignon just as the recipe said and the only good thing was it didn't take as long to cook compared to stewing beef. Using 1 cup of barley made the soup too thick so I had to keep adding more chicken stock at the end to make it more like soup rather than the pasty stew it had become. Overall, it tasted OK but I wouldn't rush to make it again.

The combo of veggies worked surprisingly well. I took advice of another reviewer and added 3 cloves crushed garlic and a couple of tsp of Worcestershire sauce. Also added a tiny bit of fresh rosemary. This required longer cooking (90 min) until that moment occurred when the flavors release and blend and go from 'mixture of ingredients' to become 'soup'. I increased the liquid with an extra cup or two of beef broth - glad I did, because it thickened up a lot the next day.

This recipe is in my roster of things to make lots of and freeze for later. While there is a lot of chopping involved, the hearty and tasty soup is well worth it in the end, and it heats up perfectly! I don't modify the recipe at all, it suits my taste as is.

What a comforting and delicious soup this is! I don't eat a lot of beef, but when we do have a roast with any sort of leftovers, this is what I immediately think of! This is a terrific base recipe that you can alter to suit your taste or use what is on hand. I always make mine with leftover roast beef. The yams add something special and I would never have even considered adding them to a soup! Delicous and comforting! Easy to make. You can't go wrong!

I made a couple of changes to this recipe. First off, I used grass-fed beef shank and got it going at about 10am for a dinnertime of 7pm. (everything I list is organic... yes it does make a huge difference) I used beef and mushroom broth instead of chicken. I omitted the celery (because it's nature's joke-vegetable... yick) and added cabbage. Everyone went nuts over this "stoup" (it was really thick). My husband and 6 year old begged me to make it again about a week after the first batch. Delicious!

I used olive oil rather than butter, added chopped garlic and some worcestershire sauce and it was great!! It was exactly what I was hoping it would be on a cool day!

I made this soup the first few times with the filet mignon. While still delicious, the filet is too pricey and a waste of money as it ends up getting tough anyway. The last time I made it I used beef chuck for stew, simmered it in onion soup mix and water for about two hours till tender then added it to the soup. PHENOMINAL!! Even better the next day.

While the initial flavour of this soup was lovely it didn't last long. The barley swelled up so bad & so quickly the soup was soon like paste and the taste was gone. I love soups but this one won't make it to my recipe collection.

This was hands down the best beef barley soup I've ever tasted. I didn't have a yam so I used a regular potato and used italian barley which was so nutty and yummy. I also used a london broil instead of filet mignon and it was perfect. My 9 year old ate it cold the next day and she is a picky eater. The vegetables really added to the soup, amazing!

A fantastic soup, and yes, the filet mignon is worth it (I've tried without, and just not the same). I include carrots, and generally use more stock than called for. Even better if you can make it in advance. Serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese, a nice light salad and great crusty bread.

This was a terrific, meal on a cold rainy Vancouver night. I used carrots instead of sweet potatoes, and sirloin instead of filet. The whole family loved it and did not even want side dishes.

This recipe didn't disappoint as a colder-than-usual-Summer-pick-me-up. I omitted the broccoli and cauliflower, and added carrots, parsnips, and corn. I used a cheaper cut of beef, and just allowed it to simmer longer than called for. Will definitely make this again, although hopefully not until next Winter. Delicious.

Very good, tasty and hearty. Great for winter!

I made this with leftover beef from some steaks that we had grilled a few nights before. I agree about adding the broccoli and cauliflower just before serving as they do get mushy when over cooked. My husband isn't much of a soup eater but went back for more even after dinner! Definitely a successful meal.

This is a lovely, more refined and subtle soup than many of its kind. The combination of vegetables and using filet mignon rather than hearty stew meat may initially strike you as unlikely, but this is one to take a leap of faith with. As many others suggested, I added the sweet potato, broccoli and cauliflower near the end of cooking time and the results are better--particularly when reheating leftovers.

Very savory and hearty soup. I did use the filet and loved the difference. Much more tasty and tender than regular stew beef. I also used carrots in place of sweet potato and thought that the red potato and turnip were plenty of starch. The cauliflower did fall apart at the end and I added it last. But, it added texture and thickening to the soup. Loved it with homemade foccacia bread and salad.

With all the raves this soup ganered, I expected more. I don't know where I went wrong, but I need more savoriness. May try to make again, maybe adding garlic. But I'll more likely just move on to another beef barley recipe. I did only use stewing beef, since my local grocery was out of filet mignon . . . Could that have made the difference?

Everyone loves this soup! i would like to serve it at a casual dinner party but need suggestions as to what to serve with it besides some bread.

This is a delicious soup. Based on other reviews, I added the broccoli and cauliflower in with the beef, and the texture was perfect. I also used a parsnip in place of the turnip, and it added a nice sweetness. The sweet potatoes came out a bit too soft, so next time I might add them in a bit later than is called for. Otherwise, this is a very flavorful and hearty soup that I would definitely make again.

The first time I made this soup, my 8-year-old son came and whispered in my ear, "Mama, I don't like this soup." I was surprised and said, "You don't?" "No," he bellowed, "I LOVE it!" I used boneless top sirloin and seared it. Used carrots instead of sweet potatoes, added a bit more stock, and added the broccoli and cauliflower later. It's a fabulous, filling meal.

Wow, what an explosion of veggies. Wonderful and so tasty. I used the organic vegetable, beef and chicken broths. Also I seared the beef tenderloin prior to adding to the liquid. Definately a keeper. I am going to share this one with the gals at my fitness club, 440 Fitness located in Burlington, ON. I know they will love it.

I substituted the beef for lamb. Absolutely delicious!!!

Overall, a good flavorful soup with a good blend of vegis. Next time, I would sear the meat first, then add everything else in all at once,(except for the parsley. They also have you cooking the vegis too long. I would make it again with the above alterations.

Very good flavor! I had a problem with lack of liquid. The vegetables need to be larger than 'chopped', less barley or ?? While simmering, I had to keep adding stock to keep the soup from drying out and sticking to the pot. Definitely use filet mignon, it's worth the expense.

I've made this soup several times now and I do not add the beef or the cauliflower or broccoli until the soup is done cooking. I add it when the other ingredients are done. However, I do this as I freeze it for my personal chef clients. However, I would still not add the broccoli or cauliflower until the soup's almost done. But it is totally delicious, albeit expensive. I also do not follow the exact amounts. I use more beef, more vegetables, but I love this soup!

Absolutely fabulous, the mixture of vegtables is devine, but I added the brocholli and cauliflower the same time as the beef. My guests all requested the recipe

Oh yes, yes, yes. If you like beef and barley this is divine. I was skeptical about the vegetables used (yams, cauliflower, broccoli) but it all came together. I did use a bit more stock.

It was okay. Alittle dry- I tried adding a lot more thyme and oregano. I also had to add alot more chicken broth when cooking. Also make sure that you cut the vegetables into one-inch cubes because they will fall apart quickly.
