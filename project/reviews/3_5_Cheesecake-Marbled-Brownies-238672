I have been making these brownies exactly per the recipe since they first appeared in Gourmet in 2007. We are a family of chocoholics and cheesecake lovers, and we all give these rich and decadent brownies an enthusiastic two thumbs up. I personally think it's plenty chocolate-y enough--but, for those who don't, it's easy enough to add a tablespoon or two of unsweetened cocoa to the batter to amp up the chocolate ratio. I think there's a nice balance between the chocolate and the cheesecake flavors, and I like the ying and yang of that. I've posted this "frantastic" recipe on my blog: http://www.fransfavs.com/2013/02/cheesecake-marbled-brownies/#more-5519

I did as other reviewers suggested and added an extra ounce of chocolate, and 2Tb of cocoa powder. Even with all the extra chocolate my husband still put chocolate chips on top. Also added a couple Tb of sour cream to loosen up the cheesecake part. Tasty, but definitely not perfect.

I did make one change, I used milk chocolate chips instead of unsweetened. They were fabulous! Everyone loved them. Must refrigerate before eating would be my only other suggestion! Will make again.

This is a great recipe! Some reviewers say that it's not chocolatey enough, but I think it's a matter of preference. So try it out as the recipe calls for before making any changes. But I may go for double chocolate by adding semi- sweet morsels into the cheesecake portion. It's pretty easy and I've brought it to a couple of potlucks who liked it!

I didn't follow the brownie portion of the recipe as I prefer mine with cocoa rather than melted chocolate; instead I subbbed my favorite brownie recipe and otherwise made as written. I would have liked a higher cheesecake-to-brownie ratio, so I might work on that next time. After baking for 32 minutes and serving straight from the fridge (a must), I thought these were great, very fudgy and decadent. Everyone ate them up.

These haven't come out of the oven yet, but a couple of observations, mostly echoing previous reviewers. First, I have never liked brownies that use melted chocolate for chocolate flavor, so I used my favorite cocoa powder brownie recipe instead. Second, these do not swirl like the picture! I think the key is to do as others have suggested - reserve some brownie batter to dollop atop the cream cheese layer, and then swirl. Otherwise it looks like toasted marshmallow on top, not the nice, dramatic, marbled look we're all going for. Will post a rating/review tomorrow once I've tried them.

These are amazing. The secret, as I think some posters have mentioned, is to chill them in the fridge. They are good warm/room temp, but chilled they become more fudgey and are to die for.

My daughter, Laura, made these delectable brownies last night. our whole family is endulging in these brownies. (I think I might gain twenty pounds.) She used 3 ounces of unsweetened chocolate instead of 2 and it made all the difference. They are perfectly moist and beautiful.

Such a hit at my BBQ! Keeping this recipe on hand for many future brownie needs.

Made these brownies and was very impressed. I took the advise from the other reviews and decided to double the amount of chocolate stated i melted half with the butter and choped up the rest and added it before i added the cheesecake batter. I swirled both mixtures with a cocktail stick and baked for 35mins. will defo make again.

These brownies were really cakey, which I didn't love, and the cheesecake topping was too thick to swirl easily! Many seem to like it, so I'm not sure if I did something wrong! I will say, though, that these were pretty tasty with dulche de leche and fresh strawberry jam (separately!).

Delicious- made my whole house smell amazing. Did come out a little more cake-y than I had hoped for however, might use more chocolate next time to increase the richness.

This recipe was easy and very tasty. I would have liked a different brownie taste, but I think that is very easy aspect to adjust. This recipe is great because you can substitute your favorite recipes into this basic format.

Rating: 2
The recipe is simple and good, and the cheesecake swirl concoction was tasty. However, swirling is very difficult without some sort of special tool. And in spreading it as best possible, it made the brownies cook unevenly. Make sure the cream cheese mixture is soft and at room temperature. Try to spread it evenly with some sort of tool.

YUM!!! I made these for a gathering one Sunday afternoon and was delighted at the simplicity and taste. The brownie part was a bit too thick and I would rather have a thinner brownie (larger pan?) or more cream cheese, though. They were delicious warm but I think they would set up more if refrigerated and the brownie would be less cake-like. OVERALL VERY GOOD. Would (and will) make again. Oh, and I saved some of the brownie layer to dollop on top of the cream cheese and swirl. Beautiful.

I baked up a ton of these guys for a graduation banquet to feed 100+. Simple, elegant, delicious. Needless to say, this large-scale bake-a-thon led me to some observations that may help others. Like other reviewers, I added chocolate chips for a deeper chocolate flavor, and sour cream to the topping. Otherwise, I kept everything as the recipe states. * This recipe doubles or triples beautifully. * Melting butter and chocolate in a large mixing bowl in the microwave (checking frequently) is quicker. * To get the best marble look, hold out some of the brownie batter. After you've smoothed the cream cheese topping on, drop bits of the reserved brownie batter on top, THEN swirl into the cream cheese. My first attempts to do as the recipe instructed created a brownish unattractive mess. * For the most attractive pieces, refrigerate until firm and THEN cut. * It's true what others are saying about the chocolate flavor; it's more like a German- chocolate cake than a deep brownie flavor. I'm looking forward to serving these at the banquet if my own family will just stop sneaking off with them.

Delicious! I baked them for 32 minutes, and they were very fudgy. The cheesecake swirl was really good too, although it didn't swirl very easily. Make sure the cream cheese is softened all the way through!

You definitely need more chocolate for this recipe...I used 3 oz of semi-sweet chocolate and added about a handful of chocolate chips as per other reviewers suggestions and these were really tasty! I couldn't even imagine it with less chocolate, I might even add more if I make them again. Also, 30 minutes in the oven was perfect. I served them warm with ice cream and berries and everyone gobbled them up.

These were okay. The cream cheese saved it. Could have been more cholatey tasting - adding chocolate chips would definitely help. My batch didn't look as pretty as the picture.

Made it yesterday. We loved it!!!! Did have to change the recipe a bit. I cut the sugar in the brownie part by 2/3 of a cup and added 1 ounce more chocolate semi sweet and 2/3 cup bittersweet chocolate pieces. In the cheesecake I put a 1/2 cup sour cream. Oh I doubled the recipe so all the changes are for a doubled recipe. All in all FABULOUS!!!!!!!!

These were pretty good!I live at a high altitude, and so left the brownies in the oven for longer than the recipe called for, and they were still a little soggy in the middle. Other than that, great, easy recipe! Perfect for a small, sweet snack though it is probably not the thing to make when you are craving chocolaty brownies!

this recipe is very average, there is nothing special about it. The brownies turned out fine, but they had very little taste. I also think there should have been more cheesecake added to them, there turned out to be very little. The brownie base could defineltey have been richer. I won't make these again, but they're fine for something quick and easy that kids will enjoy.

I used whipped cream cheese instead of the regular, even though it is usually not recommended for baking. I added 3 table spoons of sour cream to the cheesecake batter, and topped it with chopped pecan, chilled in the fridge overnight. It turned out FANTASTIC. I agree that the brownie could be sweeter and richer. Definitely going to make this again! And next time I will add cocoa to the brownie batter and use semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened.

These were amazing! I did slightly alter the recipe though to make pumpkin cheescake brownies. Which turned out to be one of the BEST desserts I have ever tasted. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the brownie batter and doubled the vanilla in it. Then I added 1/2 cup organic pumpkin, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese batter. Mine baked for about 38 min. A keeper for SURE!

Despite dodgey reviews, I was drawn to this recipe by the simple fact that I love brownies, I love cheesecake, and they look so pretty!!! I let the cream cheese sit out overnight, which allowed for it to really soften, used bittersweet chocolate, as I couldn't find unsweetened, and substituted brown sugar for regular. The recipe was extremely easy to make, and I found that 35 minutes at 350F was perfect. I thought they were delicious warm and at room temperature, and although I would have liked to try them cold, I didn't have the chance, as they disappeared so quickly from the plate!!!

I made this recipe before reading reviews and made it according to the recipe with slightly more chocolate and added about 2 tablespoons sour cream to the cheesecake mixture to make it more creamy. I will probably put it in the refridgerator now and then add chocolate chips next time I make it.

Loved, loved, loved it- cooked ten minutes less like others recommended- I even only had half the cream cheese listed, so I made a 1/2 batch of the cheesecake part & added it to the regular amount of brownie batter & it worked just fine, it just didn't have quite as much marbled effect. very, very good!

This brownie was a big, gooey hit at a recent picnic. I added about 2 tablespoons dutch process cocoa that I had mixed with 2 tablespoons warm water to the chocolate mixture to boost the chocolate flavor. I didn't add extra time like some people did, but they cooked just fine.

GREAT RICH BROWNIES!!! I baked for 28 minutes--35 would be way too long. I added a canned frosting (sour cream chocolate) & some finely chopped walnuts on top. These are sinful. I keep in refrigerator as the frosting would get too soft if left out.

I agree with the others. This needs more chocolate. I disagree with the recipe for serving warm. Have you ever had warm cheesecake? Chill these babies and you will love them. I give the updated version 4 forks.

Quite good, super-fast and easy-to-make brownies. I love a dessert recipe that doesn't require me to drag my KitchenAid out in my tiny NYC apartment kitchen! Next time I may significantly decrease the sugar and use bittersweet chocolate instead - I would have liked a darker, richer chocolate taste to contrast with the yummy cream cheese. I also have to disagree with the recipe: we thought these were particularly delicious cold from the fridge.

Made these for my book club and everyone wanted the recipe. Very fast and easy to prep w/o a lot of clean up.
