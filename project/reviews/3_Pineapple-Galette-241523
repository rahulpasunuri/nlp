As I always do with a new recipe, I made it as written. It was simple and a good everyday type of dessert. I will add some pineapple preserves as a glaze when I make it again and brush the folded over pastry with an egg white wash for an all over glazed look.

Really delicious. I used tapioca flour as suggested by the previous reviewer, and that worked well. I had fresh apricots on hand and put a row of them in and garnished with some giant raisins. The flavors were outstanding. Only issue was that it took much longer to bake than the recipe suggested - at least another 15 minutes.

I'm usually intimidated by pastry but this was easy and turned out terrific. Didn't have semolina, so I pulverized minute tapioca in the coffee grinder and used it instead--no juice spillage and perfect thickening.
