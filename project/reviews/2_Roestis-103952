I'm sure this recipe is good, because I make the same thing at home, except that it isn't a recipe for Rösti. This recipe is for Bratkartoffeln ("fried potatoes" in German). Rösti (or Roesti, if you lack an ümlaut on your keyboard) are actually made with grated potatoes, something like a latke or hashbrowns.
