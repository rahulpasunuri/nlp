A couple of variations: I doubled the recipe and replaced 1/3 of the flour with ground oats I had in the fridge. Also, I used half frozen blackberries and half frozen cherries. Finally, I added a substantial amount of vanilla because I think every batter recipe requires it. Very excited to take these to a brunch in a few minutes! (I have to say, though, the batter is SO fantastic...why is it always the case that the batter beats out the flavor of the muffin any day?!)

too dry. once adding in dry ingredients, the "batter" became like PIE DOUGH!!!! I should have used my own "recipe". Combine wet ingredients and add to dry until barely mixed. Needs an additional 1/2 cup of milk/cream.

Merely edible. The brown sugar, all butter and no oil, and a 400 degree oven made the tops an unappetizing brown color and CRISPY. The texture was heavy. The sweetness a muffin should have just wasn't there. What a waste of my beautiful blueberries.

I made these muffins the other day and they came out delicious! I omitted the cinnamon and added vanilla extract,nutmeg,and lemon zest. I also put in less sugar. They came out soo good for the first time making them. I would definitely make them again! Don't over-cook them or they will be dry :)

Just made this with blueberries I picked today. Left recipe as is, except I added some vanilla and made it into a loaf instead of muffins. It is excellent. I am thinking that it will be gone soon, but if not, it would make a fantastic french toast! I will make it again!

I made thise receipe this morning. Not too impressed. The batter was a bit dry and even after I added extra blueberries. Also have to agree with the other poster that said blueberries & cinnamon don't mix. I might try this receipe again but use pie filling apples instead.

Excellent recipe! Followed it to a T. Made them for Mothers' Day, and they were a hit with everyone. I'll be making them again tomorrow actually, because the 4 dozen that I made over the weekend were gone in a day or two, and my family wants more. And I'll probably keep referring back to this recipe in the future!

These were great! I edited the recipe and they still came out moist and delicious. Here's how I made them into cherry almond muffins: I substituted chopped (thawed) cherries for blueberries and I added a tsp of almond extract instead of the cinnamon, then put sliced almonds on top of each muffin before baking. I also used half whole wheat flour and all skim milk. These are very versatile and highly recommended.

I had blueberries that were not very sweet (go buy blueberries in the winter). So I made these. The only change I made was to use mini muffin pans. I will keep this recipe and as another reviewer mentioned use the base for other addins.Everyone loved them and appreciated the bite size.

These muffins are good. My husband liked them and told me to keep the recipe. I think I prefer my old recipe for muffins with a crunchy top but this one is good for a change.

this really is a great recipe. minus the cinnamon and blueberries and this works perfectly for any type of muffin you want. i make them with my 2 1/2 year old son and we use chocolate chips or apple or pear or banana and nuts. the recipe does make a small batch, perfect for at home when you don't want to be eating muffins all week! if you want to make a dozen huge muffins just double the recipe. i found 25 minutes to be the perfect timing.

Good muffin recipe. Mine came out small and baked in about 20 min in my oven... Luckily the wonderful smell of them baking made me check them before they burned! I added a bit of cardamom along with the other ingredients since I developed an affinity for cardamom flavored baked goods while living in Sweden and the flavors mixed nicely.

Rating: 4
Very good! Doubled recipe as suggested. Substituted a little ground flax seed in place of about 1/4 cup of flour. Used slightly less butter and added applesauce. Used skim milk. Added some dry buttermilk powder (few T). Didn't use quite as much sugar and the muffins were still plenty sweet enough. Used fresh blueberries, lots extra. Came out similar to a cobbler! We used the tart less-ripe blueberries (and lots of good ones, too) that we picked today, in this recipe, and the muffins were still sweet enough.

Rating: 2
After reading all the reviews, I decided to skip the cinnamon and use lemon zest. I also subbed greek yogurt for the milk. They have a good flavor, but I agree with the other reviewers, these are small muffins. I'll make them again but i'll fill 9 instead of 12.

This worked just fine as written. However, like other reviewers noted, it is sweet and cinnamony. Were I to make it again, I would cut back on both. but, even if you did nothing, they are good muffins. and super easy to throw together when guests are coming over!

This is a great recipe! I used spelt flour since I'm allergic to wheat, used fresh apples and frozen raspberries instead of blueberries, and added a little extra cinnamon. They are delicious! The only complaint I have is that they are a little dry, but spreading a little butter on them fixes that nicely

This recipe was THE BEST! We did change it a little though. We didn't want to use the cinnamon so we used a tablespoon of vanilla extract. We also put three cups of sugar in stead of 1 cup. Also put some white sugar in too. We used frozen blueberries. DO NOT LET BATTER SIT BECAUSE BLUEBERRIES WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM!!!!!!! ALWAYS make a double batch! You would be surprised how quickly they go!

These muffins are phenomenal!!! I took A Cook from Los Angeles's suggestions and used buttermilk, then dusted the tops with raw cane sugar. Also, like Muttlover171 I did not wait long enough for the butter to cool. It made no difference. I didn't have a 1/2 cup muffin pan, but a 1/3 cup so mine took only about 17 minutes to cook. These blueberry muffins will definitely be making an appearance at my party and on my road trip next month!

My daughter and I pretty much did everything wrong in the recipie and the muffins were fantastic.

These were great little muffins. I definitely could have left a few minutes off of the cooking time, but all in all they were solid and a great way to use up summer blueberries.

Phenomenal recipe, the best blueberry muffins I've ever made or eaten, and everyone I've made them for feels the same way. Rave reviews all around. The batter tastes like streusel topping, and the muffins are dense and moist and not overly sweet. Great, great stuff!

Really good recipe. Better than any muffin I've had from a bakery. I used Softasilk cake flour, 7 tbspns butter, and half and half rather than milk because that's all I had. I also used an entire pt of blueberries. The extra fat and berries made these extra delicious I'm sure, but they are likely just as good as the recipe is written. I will definitely make these many times more.

I won't rate the recipe since I changed it quite a bit, but I really liked how they turned out. Per many of the suggestions already offered, I cut the sugar to 2/3 C, added just a touch of cardamom, a 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla, added even more blueberries (about 2 cups total. With fresh berries the batter does not turn purple. Added 1/2 C. Grapenuts and some wheat germ/ground flax seed for a little fiber. Intended to add the orange zest, but forgot - I think it would be a nice addition. Not as cake-like as many muffins, but plenty tender. Sprinkled some cinnamon-sugar on top and they had a nice delicate crunch.

Rating: 4
These muffins are quite good - I took some of the dry mixture out and rolled the frozen blueberries around in it and then added it to the rest. The blueberries did not bleed as much. I added some orange zest to the batter, it added a really nice flavour -- blueberry and orange taste great together.

I've made this recipe twice now, once with blueberries, and once with apples. Apples are far better! Recipe is good, but improves with tweaking. The most important thing, as others have said, is not to overbake. 12 muffins were done in about 16 minutes, and 9 larger muffins in 20 minutes. I didn't use muffin liners, just greased the tin lightly. Neither rose all that much (no muffin tops). First time, I used fresh blueberries, substituted one tablespoon of applesauce for some of the butter, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, left out the cinnamon, and sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking. Second time I used cut-up peeled Granny Smith apples, substituted two tbsp applesauce for butter, included the cinnamon, and added 1 tsp vanilla. These were incredibly moist and succulent, and the cinnamon flavor was perfect. YUM!

Rating: 2
I thought these were OK. I'm glad I cut back on the sugar but they were still very sweet. I also think the cinnamon should be a hint, not an overwhelming flavor, so IF I make these again, I'll keep the cinnamon at 1 teaspoon, per recipe.

Rating: 3
They are just delicious, but I feel sad about putting a whole cup of sugar into just 12 muffins. They were deliciously sweet, I might try to use 3/4 a cup and see if they taste as good. Moist and delicate. I also cranked the temp up to 500 for the last 60 seconds of baking to make a brown the tops and make a crust. Very delicious.

Had a weekend away in the country with friends and brought a batch of these up with me for our country breakfast. DEEELISH! (my mouth is watering right now thinking about them). The muffin was just the right consistency and so moist. I will definitely be making these again (probably this week!)

Rating: 4
Really delicious! Like the others, I would use some whole wheat flour, at least to alleviate my conscious! I added a bit more cinnamon, and some vanilla, for good measure. For those who found that their batter turned purple... I saw a trick on Food Network, and tried it and it worked like a charm! You just put a little bit of flour in a bowl and toss in your frozen blueberries - when the blueberries are coated a little bit in flour, they don't run when baked.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe. I too reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups, added a couple of tablespoons of applesauce to the butter (reduced by 1 tablespoon) and used frozen mixed berries (chopped into small bits first). I made half of the recipe in mini- muffins and the other half in regular size. Yum for my kids and yum for the grownups.

Rating: 4
These are amazing! I'm a student living in a house with 5 boys, and when I baked these, they were gone pretty quickly. The muffins were really light and soft and moist in the middle, I didn't have a problem with the batter going purple, maybe because I used fresh berries? Didn't make any modifications to the original recipe, but will try the sugar on top for extra crunch the next time I make these! I think it might also be good as a base for any berry muffin, the muffin batter tastes soooo good.

Rating: 3
This one is a keeper...with a few changes. Whole wheat flour is a must (too cakey with just old white). Apple sauce instead of the butter (so they won't be greasy). And up the spice like other reviewers had suggested: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp dried ginger, 1 tsp vanilla extract. Zippy! Oh, and I like a hearty muffin so I made this into 9 muffins instead of 12.

This is my second review. Since I make this so often, I have been changing it up. this is the only recipe my kid will eat.

These did not turn out as well as I had hoped. As we needed more than just 12 muffins, we doubled the recipe. We also used dark brown sugar instead of the suggested light brown. That may have been the fatal flaw, I have no clue, but they turned out hard and flat. They did not rise at all and looked much more like scones than muffins. I do like the cinnamon bit, though I think I will just add that to my normal muffin recipe.

I was a little concerned about these might be too sweet so I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup. Everything else I did exact per recipe. They turned out great...definitely will make again.

This may have ended my search for a good basic blueberry muffin recipe. This is the 3rd muffin recipe I've tried, and it is very good. I left out the cinnamon, because I'm making it for kids and wanted a less complex taste. Mine turned out moist and fairly light, not dense as others have commented. The only negative is that the batter (and hence, the muffins) turned purple when I mixed in the blueberries, even though I folded them in very carefully (maybe this is because I used frozen blueberries?) On the second try, I may cut the amount of blueberries somewhat and mix the berries with some of the reserved dry ingredients before folding them in.

I just put these in the oven and if the batter is any indication of the end result, they will be delicious! I love the thickness of the batter and the hint of cinnamon. I added half a tsp. of vanilla, simply because I love vanilla. Next time I may add a full teaspoon, but I used a stronger vanilla than normal and didn't want to overpower the muffin. This is a quick and yummy recipe that I recommend for breakfast, brunch, dessert, etc. ;)

These are really the best! I used frozen blueberries and sprinkled raw sugar cristals on top before baking. Fantastic!

Best muffins I've ever had. I made one batch with blueberries for a brunch party, and tasted one. I knew they would be gone instantly, so I made another batch with diced apples. Both turned out wonderfully, very easy. I can't imagine ever going back to more standard "white" muffins.

These muffins are great! I was not sure about using brown sugar with blueberries, but I was delighted with the result. The muffins did not have the cakey consistency that white sugar often yields. YUM! I made one addition - I added about a half cup of Grapenuts which added a suptle crunch. A good add.

Used raspberries instead of blueberries.. Recipe is okay but the flavor doesn't pop. Also, recipe didn't make enough batter for 12 normal size muffins. Also, cooked in 13 mins in a convection oven.

A+ for sure, provided that high quality, fresh blueberries are used and you don't over cook them. I paired this recipe with scrambled eggs, Applewood smoked bacon, and the killer, a fruity, crisp, blanc-de-blanc champagne and fresh squeezed blood-orange juice.

I made these muffins with frozen blueberries and worked great. Not only were they extremely easy to make, my son loved them too! Nice brown color from the sugar, foil muffin liners ripped, but paper didn't.

Simple, Quick and delish.. not more to say except they are a little heavy on the fat content if that concerns you. I think they would work well with rasberries as well but have not tried that yet.

Yum. Moist and delicate and gooo-oo-od! My changes: I used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and cardamom instead of cinnamon. I also dusted the tops with coarse sugar before baking.

This recipe was a huge hit with my husband. Since we are just a household of two, he took the muffins to work, where they were also a huge hit. We love this recipe! I made one modification though. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on to the tops of the poured batter before baking. Yummy!

Yum. I'll definitely be making these again. Used 2% milk instead of whole.

I hate baking and these were a snap. Definitely ramp up the cinnamon!

Yummy! Quick and easy. I only had fat free milk and it worked out fine. I also only baked for 20 minutes and that was perfect. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. Add more cinnamon for a bit more zing. Applesauce makes a nice addition, will try that next time.

Tasty, and very quick and easy to make. I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon-sugar before baking. They were done after 20 minutes in the oven, and would have been definitely overbaked if I left them cooking for the time recommended in the recipe. I'll make these again.

I made these exactly as written and was a bit disappointed. They didn't taste much of cinnamon at all, although the were okay, otherwise.

Saw this recipe in the back of the magazine, realized I had all the ingredients on hand, and one hour later they were coming out of the oven! Very tasty and fast and easy to whip up. Lots of brown sugar flavor, which was different for a blueberry muffin.
