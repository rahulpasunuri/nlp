I followed this recipe EXACTLY. I even weighed the onions. I hated it. It had a weird taste. Save yourself the time and effort and buy a sauce. If you have to make one, make a homemade mayo.

Oh my gosh! This was such an amazing sauce! I was looking for something to put over homemade artichoke ravioli and this was IT! I used half and half which made it a little "lighter" as well as omitted the onion reduction step. The scant amount of onion juice helped thin the sauce a bit too. Topped with freshly grated parm and this was a fantastic dinner!

I thought this was a great sauce. Cut it in half for four. My suggestion would be to put it over filet mignon. It does tend to be thick. So pan sear the filets and use additional white wine to deglaze the pan. Add this to the sauce to thin. Finish the filets in the oven and serve the sauce very warm.

I made this recipe following the instructions, but prepared to do some thinning afterwards if it was really necessary. Unfortunately, we both found the flavour overly sweet and rather cloying, disliking the taste so much that we didn't want to use any more wine or cream on the project. It was a real disappointment, but a matter of personal taste I suppose.

This was a very nice sauce. I served it with pan-fried chicken breasts, and roasted veg and potatoes and it went over very well. However, when I make it again, I will use a lot more wine and eliminate the roux. It was too thick, and the onion puree and cream should be sufficient to thicken to the proper consistency.

This recipe is great with some modifications. I was looking for a sauce to use my fresh tarragon from the garden. I roasted an elephant garlic along with the onions (the garlic should be added to the oven about 30 min after the onions.)I pureed the onions and garlic but did not reduce the puree by heating. After adding the puree to the roux, I still needed to add extra wine to thin the sauce. I used only tarragon (not the other herbs)to keep the flavor simple. I will use this sauce on pasta with shrimp or other seafood. Definetly will not use it on beef!

Amazing! Who could ask for a better treat! Definately try it and do add more wine to thin out the sauce a bit. It is such a wonderful treat and heck who can't use more wine in their meal.

I have to disagree with the review from the cook in France. This is an incredible sauce for those looking for a special treat! I did add more wine than called for, and perhaps this answers the previous reviewer's concerns of too thick of a sauce. This is a bit unconventional for red meat, but certainly worth it! A full 4 forks!

I was not expecting such a thick, gooey, creamy sauce, especially since it is suggested to accompany steak. It came out with the taste and consistency of cream cheese or sour cream. Maybe it might be good as some kind of spread for crackers, but definitely not on beef.
