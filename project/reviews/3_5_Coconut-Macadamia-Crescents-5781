These are my favorite cookies to make during the holidays and they're a perennial favorite among friends. I use unsalted nuts and cook less than 20 minutes. They take more time than most but are well worth it

I was surprised to find that these cookies were so SALTY. The crescents took quite a while to make and I couldn't even eat them. My husband claims to have liked them, and ate the whole batch. If you do try this recipe, I would try UNsalted nuts.

These cookies melt in your mouth and are fabulous. I made them for a party and everyone loved them. They would make wonderful holiday cookies! You can't eat just one, or two, or.....!

these are one of our favourites; a little difficult to shape as they dont hold together well but maybe a little sprinkle of water would help- regardless these are so yummy.

These cookies are great, especially for the holidays. I found the 20 minute baking time was much too long. Make sure to take these cookies out of the oven as soon as they start to turn golden or they will come out too dry. I babysat them pretty much the whole time. But they were well worth it! Also, I found I had to use a cookie sheet with sides on it or they cooked way too quickly. Good luck.

Although my husband was not as impressed with these due to their lack of chocolate, I thought they were phenomenal.

This cookie has a light, crumbly texture and a subtle coconut flavor. Unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problems with the dough, even though I chilled it overnight. Once you start working it into a crescent, the dough held together just fine. My husband, who doesn't prefer coconut desserts, loved them, as did the rest of my guests. These cookies, with their crescent shape and rich taste stand out in an assortment. These are a keeper!

I can't think of one person (who have tried these cookies) who can only eat one -- and I have made these cookies for many people.

I'd make this dish again, but with modifications--whan I made the dough, it totally crumbled and was impossible to work with--it was way too dry to shape into anything! So I added an egg, and that made the dough manageable--and the cookies came out fine--tasty, in fact!

I made these last year for Christmas and everyone loved them. Searched for and found them on your web site to make again this year - thank you!
