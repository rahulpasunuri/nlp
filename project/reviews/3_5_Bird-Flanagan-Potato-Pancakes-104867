It was good. But I think it's missing something and I don't know what. One thing is certain. I ate too much :-S I think it would be better if the potatoes were mash and not grated. Even though they were cooked, they had a slimey feel to them, which I didn't enjoy. I won't make it again.

Though it's a Polish and Russian tradition as opposed to Irish, applesauce along with sour cream is an amazing topping.

Simple and tasty. I've made this several times and have found it to be a good fast dinner. My one trick to get more of a pancake texture is squeeze the liquid out of the potatoes. Then let the starch settle out, and decant the liquid away and finally mix the eggs to the starch. (One of my friends always does this when making latkes)

If you follow the recipe exactly, this turns out more like sticky hashbrowns than pancakes. That's not a bad thing, just not what I was expecting. The flavors were great together. Great with a little sour cream. Next time, I'm going to shred the potatoes finer, add an extra egg and make individual pancakes.

Fantastic! I made it for St.Patricks Day, with lamb. I left out the Canadian Bacon, and added chopped mint into the potato mixture. It was colorful and added a nice, subtle flavor.

What a great recipe! There is a definite lack of "elegant" cooking in Irish cuisene, but this recipe is just that. The combination of these ingredients souns like it would be bland, but they combine to provide great flavors, as well as a good texture. The great mix of colors provides for easy plate arrangement. This would be great with a classy dry white or an easy pint of Guinness. Over all, a very nice gourmet dish.
