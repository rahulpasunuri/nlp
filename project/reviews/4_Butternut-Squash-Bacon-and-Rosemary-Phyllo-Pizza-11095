Despite this pizza's good taste, I'm only giving it two stars for two reasons: When you make the pizza as directed (i.e., using phyllo dough sheets to make a pizza vs. using ready-made phyllo cups), the recipe is not that easy (or maybe I should say, quick to make) nor is the pizza easy to cut up and serve as an appetizer. I made this for a party. The pizza easily crumbled apart as you cut it and the squash, being cooked squash, wasn't easily sliced into neat pizza squares. You really had to roll it up and eat it, making it not the neatest appetizer at a party. Making it was more time-consuming than I thought, what with individually buttering each phyllo layer. I probably should have known that, but previous reviews suggested this recipe was very easy to make. I'd make it again...it was tasty...but only in individual, pre-made phyllo cups.

I have served this squash three times in the last two weeks. I used phyllo cups instead of the pizza method. My husband claims that he has fallen in love with me all over again thanks to this dish. It is so simple. I just mix the squash with the onions and garnish with the bacon and put in a phyllo cup dusted with parmesan and heat in oven. A wonderful holiday treat.

I also used the phyllo cups and served them as hors d'ouevres at a cocktail party. They were very pretty, and delicious too.

Absolutely delicious. Used proscuitto instead of bacon, added sauteed mushrooms, and made individual phyllo shells using a mini muffin tin as this was easier to serve as appetizers. Made approximately 60 pieces.

A big hit. Not as time-intensive as it might sound (do the squash the day before). Really great flavors, and a nice change from the standard appetizer fare. We'll have it again, no doubt!

A tasty, but rich, variation is to turn it into a tart--ala the greek feta tart with phyllo. The tart made a gorgeous Thanksgiving treat. I added an egg (lightly beaten) for more glue. Yum!

great flavor combination! i used a lot less butter than the recipe called for (just pam between phyllo layers) and it was still quite flavorful.
