This cake was excellent. I took it to a party with Greek Yogurt Ice Cream (also a Bon Appetit recipe), and it was a hit. Next time however I would cook it for a few minutes less to keep it from being too dry.

I agree with juliagulia1, this cake was very dry. I carefully monitored the timing in the oven and pulled it out as soon as was done. I also agree on the egg whites in that they didn't lighten the very dense batter at all. Would it help if the oven temperature was lowered to 325 degrees, similar to a pound cake? Or to add the whole egg vs. separating? It is a shame because the cake looks great and the flavors are well balanced. I served with fig perserves, which became necessary just to make it edible.

I loved this. The cake was wonderfully textured and had subtle but great flavor. This makes a great morning treat with Grek yogurt and honey.

For the reviewer you found this dry and heavy, the only response I can think of is that you may have overcooked it slightly. When I made this according to the recipe, it came out absolutly wonderful, my all time favorite cake by far.

I was really excited about this cake after reading the reviews. My cake came out very dry and the egg whites didn't seem to lighten up the batter much. I would not waste the money making this again as the ingredients are not cheap.

Exquisitely textured and truly delicious. Like another reviewer, I also used Sambuca (except I didn't reduce it). Other modifications were using almond meal in place of the toasted ground almonds. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it came out beautifully. The only difference was that I used Sambuca since I didn't have Pernod or ouzo. The texture and crust was wonderful. It has a lovely anise flavor that didn't overwhelm the almond flavor.

I made this for a Greek Easter lunch, and it was a hit. Easy to make, and very tasty. Instead of serving it with yogurt, I made an anise-almond buttercream and served it as a frosted layer cake. Delicious.
