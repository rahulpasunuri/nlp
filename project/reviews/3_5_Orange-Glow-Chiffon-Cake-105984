mixing the whites to the right stage is what makes the chiffon cake a success, I bake chiffon cakes all the time, this one is delicious and really fluffy and light as a feather... recipes do not explain the egg-white mixing well ... it is important to reach the stiff peaks, but glossy stage... also folding carefully and softly is important...

This was great with a compote of sliced oranges, juice, and zest after homemade dim sum. Like angel food cake but richer and moister. I only needed two extra egg whites to make 1.25 cups total.

I baked three of these cakes for a friend's wedding. They were beautiful and very light tasting, dusted with powdered sugar and garnished with reddish-orange roses and jumbo strawberries. Served with strawberries and creme anglaise. Fabulous recipe!

Turned out great! I made this recipe with unbleached all-purpose flour (weighed, not measured by volume). Also, I made only a half recipe, and baked it in a 9x13" pan, since I didn't have a tube pan. (A tube pan holds 16 cups, my pan holds 8.) It was perhaps a bit thin, but it cooked nicely.

Very good texture and flavour. It took ten minutes longer to bake in my oven. Very nice with a tropical fruit salad on the side, I sprinkled it with icing sugar and it looked pretty.

Just delicious and beautiful. I also love all the chiffon cakes from the Cake Bible but this may be my favorite. I serve it w/ a tropical fruit honey "salad" and people just love it. It's perfect at the end of a heavy, spicy meal. I definitely use the superfine sugar and I have a angel food cake folder (from Vermont Country catalog) that makes the folding a breeze.

This is a lovely spongecake. I found it the slightest bit plain with just powdered sugar (next time, I'd serve it with sweet berries and whipped cream). Not too sweet -- didn't follow the bottle cooling technique. Oh, and I used half sunflower/half canola oil and it was just fine (not worth buying another bottle of oil for one cake).

This was delicious. A light and refreshing cake with delightful orange flavor. Of course I don't even want to know how many calories each slice has. Yes, I would make this again. The tips at the end of the recipe were very helpful.

This was a very delicious cake, very light and fluffy! I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and put about 5 daisies in the middle and about 8 around the bottom of the cake and it looked so cute!! Great for a spring party! I did not have the problem with inverting it over the wine bottle, although I did have to ask my boyfriend to help cause I was a bit too 'blonde' to figure it out. :o) But it sat like that for a good 2/3 hours while cooling and no problems.

Pointers for success: Do not follow the directions for inverting the cake over a bottle. After being precariously perched hovering over my counter, the cake came out with a nice plop not 5 minutes after coming out of the oven leaving rather large irregular shards of cake clinging to the pan. To add insult to injury the middle hole in the cake turned out as large as the wine bottle I had it inverted on. Some Cake bible! Needlessly long and arduous directions. Taste was too sweet - cut back a little on the sugar if you're going to attempt this recipe.

Extremely delicious and easy cake! It rose up beautifully, and the orange flavor was nicely pronounced. I served it with whipped cream and fresh berries to the delight of my family.

The result was just great. I skipped vanilla, as we are not keen on it. I served a slice with fresh orange pulp, mango, banana and a bit of honey.

Excellent!! A cake I would definetly bake again. In my country I can´t find cake flour, so I used 2 1/8 cups of all purpuse flour and the result was great. I made a glaze of orange juice and powder sugar, and served each piece with fresh berries and Amaretto.

Excellent flavor & texture and very showy volume. Take note of POINTERS FOR SUCCESS:Do not underbake. I just moved and am calibrating the new oven. Easy to underbake. This goes into my permanent file!

This is an excellent recipe, well worth the modest effort required.

I have made all of the chiffon cakes from the Cake Bible, and they are all wonderful. They are tastier than angel food, yet still relatively low in fat, and they keep well. This cake is especially nice served with fresh fruit and fruit coulis or creme anglaise for a fancier presentation, but it's also great plain.
