This is a great recipe...infallible. I brush the pizza dough with olive oil before I bake it for two reasons, to seal it from the tomato juice and for flavor.

Best pizza dough recipe. Added a little olive oil. Used bread flower. Only needed to knead for 5 minutes. Even better from freezer.

This is a great pizza crust recipe. Very similar to the pizzas we ate in Italy.

A must for any pizza lover. I froze it after the first rise, defrosted and it was perfect. Pre-baked to hold more toppings, try it with pesto!

This was good. I'd definitely use it again.

Very very good. Definitely coat the bowl with olive oil because the flavor is picked up just enough to make this great. Tip: Use inverted sheet tray if you don't have a pizza stone. Be sure to preheat it in the oven at 500 for at least 30 minutes.

This is our FAVORITE pizza dough. Have tried lots of pizza dough recipes, but only use this one since trying it the first time. Simple, 4 ingredients, but has a wonderful flavor. No sugar, but a slight sweetness comes out. It is THE BEST pizza dough you'll ever use.

overkneaded dough makes pizza that works better as building material than food...its pretty easy to tell if pizza dough is kneaded completely, but it does take some practice... poke your dough with a your finger up to the first joint (flour your finger first) if the hole pops back all the way, or almost all the way, its kneaded. if it doesnt pop back much keep going, and if you cant poke it, yove over shot. also when rising, your dough is risen when pokign the dough in the same way it doesnt respond at all, the hole just stays there

Easy and reliable - have been making this dough for six years. Even easier is to make it in a Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook (about 5-7 minutes kneading). Perfect every time. Tip: Freezes great. After the first rise, divide the dough, wrap pieces in oiled plastic wrap and freeze them. Then, in the morning before work, take out the dough, remove from plastic wrap and place in an oiled bowl covered with plastic and put in fridge. When you get home, the dough's thawed, risen and ready to go. I make this for many of my busy clients.

my crust looked beautiful, and it was just thick enough. my family loved it. my husband told me for a bit of an artistic flare, roll it out, on cornmeal. for the cook from warrenton, the water could have been too cold, or you may not have mixed it all completely. i started one dough and had to redo it because my first one was the same as yours. i used bread flour the second time too and i think that may have helped.

The ingredients aren't perfect, but the directions for how to combine the ingredients for the dough and let it rise are. I added a pinch of sugar to the yeast mix, and olive oil. Great crust, crispy and chewy.

I made this pizza dough in a Sunbeam 1.5# bread machine. I used Breadmachine yeast (of course) and added 2.5 TBSP of olive oil to the liquid ingredients, and 1 TBSP sugar along with oregano, thyme, and a little sage. What was amazing is that it was ready in 90 minutes! It made a thin crust that crisped up along the edges, which I'm assuming would turn out different if I were to refridgerate it overnight and then let it rise in seperate portions for another hour before rolling it out... I baked it at 525 degrees for like 3 or 4 minutes before putting the sauce and toppings on. It only took 12 minutes till the pizza was done... Also, if anyone's interested, I'm vegan so instead of cheese in this pizza I used mashed potato flakes and soy milk and then added soy margarine, lemon juice and salt... after the baking it is very cheese-like... awesome to have pizza again!

I don't get it. Everyone else loves this recipe, but my crust was so tough I needed a chainsaw to cut it. What happened? Over-kneaded? Help...

This is a good recipe, a keeper. I did use bread flour like the Georgia Cook, and added dried oregano to the dough. I let the dough rise in a warm, humid spot (in my microwave with the light on and a cup of hot water) and it was ready in about half the time. Otherwise, i stuck to the directions and the crust turned out excellent.

I am hooked on this dough. It's simple to make. I use a 12 inch panso it's thin and crispy on the outside but the outer crust is still chewy.

I liked this recipe very much... I purchased a pizza stone yesterday and this was the first thing I made with it! I was very good and crunchy... But where is the baking time on the recipe????? I baked mine on the pizza stone at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes, and it turned out good my family enjoyed it very much.

This has got to be the better of of the Pizza Crust that Epicurious has.. Love it

This has become my staple pizza dough recipe. It's easy to make, gives a nice crunchy dough with a chewy inside (if rolled thick) or a thin crispy crust if rolled thin. I use quick rising yeast so the rising time is reduced by half, and precook my crust for a few minutes before I put my ingredients on top so it doesn't get soggy. I've done it with only white flour or half-half whole wheat and it always comes out great. I've also used it in a stromboli (basically rolled pizza) with great success.

This is how the pizzarias make dough: Use a basic recipe but it has to have some olive oil in it (not extra virgin)1: use high gluten (14% protien flour)..can be ordered on-line 2: mix with electric mixer (use dough hooks) for at least 15 min. Dough must stick to fingers when touched but not be too sticky. 3: rise for 2 hours covered on counter, then rise 4-24 hours in fridge, covered 4: bake at 525F on preheated pizza stone, lowest rack in oven 5: before baking, brush crust with 2 Tbsp olive oil, 1 clove crushed garlic, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp oregano. 6: add sauce 7: add combination 1/3 provolone, 2/3 mozzarella 8: add topping sparingly Just like from the pizzaria; chewey, tasty, crisp on bottom. Guaranteed

The finished product was far too dry and flaky. Add some olive oil to the dough and it would be much better.

This is a good recipe, but I prefer to add a 1/4 cup of parmesan or romano cheese. It makes the crust a lot more flavorful. Also it's a good idea to have a pizza stone in your oven, if you like crispy pizza!

It is fast and easy especially if you have a bread maker. It is what you put on it that makes it fantastic.

It was easy to make. I like the thin crust. Needless to say it was a hit!!!

Very nice pizza dough, tho I prefer a thicker crust so I would double the recipe next time, and make 1 large pizza. For those who have got used to newer trends with herbs and cheese, they could easily be added. This was also an easy recipe to make.

I made two batches. The fisrst time I felt it was just okay. The next time, I added some of my own touches. Add oregano (approx. 1 tsp.) to the mix and try some olive oil (1 Tbsp.) about 2 minutes before the dough is finish

This is your basic pizza dough recipe. The review above mine is odd to me as there really isn't anything you can do wrong to make a bad pizza dough really. I highly recommend this , and you'll make a great pizza! Just make sure you let it rise 2 times! Enjoy!
