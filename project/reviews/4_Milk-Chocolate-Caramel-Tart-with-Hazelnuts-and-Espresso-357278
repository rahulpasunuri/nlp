Awesome recipe. I didnt find the cacao nibs so i just sprinkled toasted hazelnuts on top. mine didnt look as light colored as he photo either but it didnt seem to matter. This was so delicious and elegant looking. Easy too.

Beautiful tart, comes together quickly. A no-roll crust that browns nicely, the caramel is quickly made, as is the topping. I didn't add coffee to the chocolate, instead chopped up dark chocolate covered coffee beans to sprinkle on top. Of course it's sweet! Made mine in a 10" round tart pan.

I don't understand the negative reviews of this at all. I just made it for the third time and my husband, I and everyone with whom I shared it thought it was absolutely delicious. I love everything about this tart. Yum!

Finally got around to making this and was not disappointed. Everyone loved it. I always make a recipe as written first before messing with it and was impressed. I am a dark chocolate lover and will make this with dark chocolate and a sprinkling of salt next time. It is exquisite. The crust is so wonderfully tender and buttery. Did I say it was wonderful??? I had a piece at room temperature and after chilling. Either way is fine, IMO.

Really excellent but I made a lot of changes: (1) I used a round tart pan. (2) I used bittersweet chocolate primarily because I think it makes it richer. (3) I doubled the recipe for the chocolate layer. The original recipe made a very thin layer that did not begin to fill up the tart. (4) I did not use the expresso powder because I don't like coffee. (5) I did not use the cacao nibs because I could not locate them. (6) In the caramel layer, I substituted 2 teaspoons of sea salt for the 1/4 tsp salt so I would have a "salted caramel" layer. It got rave reviews.

Made this for my mother's birthday - a definite hit. She has asked that I make two for her bridge party this weekend. Yes, it is sweet - but this is desert after all. I did not use the expresso or cocoa nibs and served with whipped creme fraiche, which cut the richness of the chocolate.

HORRIBLE! What a waste of time! Sickenly sweet. The caramel did not set. The chocolate did not set. The crust was way too hard. When I attempted to cut it just oozed everywhere, ended up throwing most of it out :(

I made this recipe exactly as written using the recommended size tart pan. The flavors are wonderful, although I found the crust and subsequent layers in the long narrow pan to be too thick and hard to cut through after chilling. I made a second batch in a wider tart pan (and shortened baking time) and had a hit on my hands with the thinner crust and layers...much easier to cut and serve. My guests enjoyed it. I served it with a B52 coffee drink.

I'm not a baker and I approached this recipe with trepidation. I followed the directions carefully and it turned out wonderfully. Didn't have the time or inclination to search for cacao nibs, so I substituted chocolate covered coffee beans. Yum!

The tart was great, there are a lot of steps in making this but it is relatively easy to make. I doubled the chocolate layer because I didn't think there was going to be enough but left the caramel layer as is. I think it was perfect. It got rave reviews from my friends.

Awesome - turned out perfectly. S.O thinks it has too much crust and not enough caramel. Did not stop him from eating lots. I would probably make with dark bittersweet chocolate next time because I like it better than milk.

Very, very good. I agree that you need to be careful with the sugar as it darkens - it can get too dark very fast. The crust tasted good - there was just too much of it and it was pretty thick, so next time I'll just disgard the extra and make it thinner. Otherwise, my family loved it!

I made this the other night and it was excellent. I was worried about the tart crust being too bland because it was so simple but it was delicious. I used liquid expresso and the coffee was weak, but I anticipated for that to happen and added a little extra. Simple, lovely, delicious!!! Serve it with expresso to knock it out of the park.

Super recipe -- easy, beautiful presentation. I used the round tart pan and it was just fine. I made it on Friday pm for a Saturday lunch and kept it in the fridge until I served it -- it was perfect.

Wonderful... made it as written then made it with bittersweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate, it was even better with the bittersweet chocolate!

I made this for Valentine's Day and my husband and I thought it was absolutely divine. I didn't have the cacao nibs but we didn't miss them. The crust is the perfect degree of crumbly and buttery, the caramel filling with the hazelnuts is the perfect degree of crunchy/chewy and the chocolate topping is just so good!! I can't wait to make this again.

I used a round tart pan and it came out just fine. Straight out of the fridge it was a little to hard to bite into. Room temperature the next day was perfect. Loved the combination of flavors.

A friend brought this to dinner this weekend, and it was amazing! All of us thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The buttery crust balanced the caramel and chocolate nicely.

Horribly sweet. Will not make again for this reason. Otherwise easy to make, came out of tart pan beautifully. Everyone who tried this, adults and kids, said it was just too sweet. Will toss the extra.

I just made this to take to a dinner party tonight. So far I am guessing it will be a winner, albeit extremely rich. I would suggest to be careful when you hit the amber color with the caramel as it will overcook quickly. It was just a tad overdone, which would have worked fine with milk chocolate on top, but I wanted the chocolate flavor to be more intense against the caramel, so I redid it, and then used 2 parts milk chocolate and one part 85% cacao chocolate for the topping. The risk with using a caramel that is lighter in color is that it will be softer. I was willing to take this risk for the sake of flavor. I added a little vanilla to both the crust and the caramel. Next time I will add ground hazelnuts to the crust. Skipped the cacao nibs because I did not have them. I will serve with a dollop of whipped cream sweetened only with a tiny bit of powdered sugar and a little frangelico. Based on how the components tasted individually, I think this will be a big hit. Regarding the tart pan, I wouldn't stray from the long thin rectangle, because it may get messy. Could easily work in individual tart pans.

This recipe was about milk chocolate. Adding the espresso defeated the purpose of using a really good milk chocolate, which I wanted as the dominant taste. Next time, I'll leave out the espresso.

This Recipe was EXCELLENT!!! the only advise I would give is to make it 1-2 days ahead so the caramel sets.

I haven't made the tart, but the amount of espresso poweder is not high enough to make the tart taste like coffee. Espresso powder and chocolate interact to make whatever you are making more "chocolatey" Sometimes chemistry is fantastic!

I did not have instant espresso (I finished it in another recipe and forgot I had to buy some more, which is a shame because I love mokka) so I just heated the cream and proceeded with the chocolate and butter as per the recipe. I also did not have any of the cocoa bits, so I used sifted powdered cocoa which, I'm guessing, gave it some of the bitter flavour the expresso would've given it. It was fabulous. I did not miss the coffee flavour, so for the lady worrying about the coffee overwhelming the chocolate flavour, do like I did (although not voluntarily) and omit the coffee. Also, I do not own a pan as the one asked for in the recipe, so I used an aluminum (throwable) pan. I cut the corners, folded down the sides and removed the tart with hardly a scratch :). I shall make this tart again when I have guests over for Valentine's.

i am going to make this tonight but have considered your question ... i think you would have issues with cutting and serving - the surface area of the trianngle from a round tart vs. the smaller bar of a rectangle tart would probably give you issues with it holding its form + this thing looks divinely decadent so it might also be too much for a serving

Would someone who makes this let me know how strong the coffee flavor is, please. I would like to make it for my son, who likes caramel and milk chocolate, but not coffee.

I'm curious to know if anyone has tried making this recipe in a standard round tart pan?
