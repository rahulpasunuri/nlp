Thought this was so-so in flavor. Not crazy about cinnamon and nutmeg on my brisket. I didn't bother trying to thicken the gravy, as I prefer an au jus type anyway. Instead I fork-mashed the onions and apricots that had cooked with the brisket to give it body and didn't add the second half of the apricots, as they can cause digestive issues for many people. My brisket was moist and tender. It is imperative that you keep the sliced meat in the gravy.

Delicious. This recipe was a big hit at our Seder. "The best brisket you've ever made." My shortcuts: I did not marinate overnight, and I did not try to thicken the pan juices with matzo meal. I did purée the veggies that were cooked with the meat, and they made a beautiful oniony slightly sweet topping for the meat. My sister scraped the gravy boat. I omitted the second dozen of apricots. Thank you Bon Appetit for a fabulous and simple recipe.

The brisket was exceptional. I served it at a dinner party and several friends who are experienced meat-cookers commented on how fantastic it was.

Made this for Passover and it was lovely. I marinated overnight and followed the instructions as written. The resting step is key - the meat came out so tender. I used a larger brisket, and increased the cooking time accordingly. The matzoh meal did not work for the thickening roux but the sauce came out very nice (but not thick, not at all).

I made this brisket for the very first Passover Seder that I hosted myself (along with the homemade Matzoh Balls and soup also from Epicurious recipes) and it was a SMASH HIT!! I'll make it again for sure!

Handy to make ahead and just rewarm it. Mine came out a bit dry, I think I should've basted a bit in the original cooking and when reheating. Absolutely delicious, though.

Based on the reviews from the toughest critics, family, this brisket was a big hit. I'm just sorry there weren't any leftovers!

This was exceptional, especially the next day. All the flavours blended together beautifully for a very interesting and unique taste. I left the meat and gravy together, and the meat did not dry out, as others who separated the two for storage commented. I didn't have cilantro, but I don't think that detracted from it at all. It was, as they say, FOR FAINTING!!

I made this for a casual cocktail party. I didn't have enough juice to make the gravy so I mashed up all the sauce and fruit stuff to make a chutney spread and served it on a platter with soft cheese, the Chutney spread and slices of slightly toasted French bread for apps/snacks it was great. I am making it again for a summer afternoon party with a Greek theme and pita bread instead of French. I am sure it will be as well received as last time. Definitely a keeper for my cookbook.

I made this for second night Seder. I got rave reviews across across the board! Easy to prepare, luscious gravy, however I did not thicken it with matzoh meal, just a nice au jus. I made it 2 days ahead, stored briskit and sauce seperatly, and then reheated the two together. I will deffinitely keep it in my Passover repitoire.

Delicious flavors, but the meat was a little on the dry side.

I thought this turned out great- between three and four forks. It was moist and delicious, and everyone seemed to love it. Even the kids (who are picky eaters) liked it. I will definitely make this recipe again.
