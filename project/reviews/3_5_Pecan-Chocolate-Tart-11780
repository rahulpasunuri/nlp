I'm relatively new to baking tarts, so that may have been a big part of the problem. I had a very hard time with the pate brisee. I had to add 5 tablespoons of ice water to get the dough to finally form a ball. Sure enough, when cooked all the extra water made the dough very tough and so chewy that its texture was like pasta - yuck! Also, even though I used a 9 inch tart pan instead of a 10 inch part pan, the recipe still did not make enough pate brisee to fill the pan with an overhang to fold back inwards. On the bright side, the filling was absolutely delicious.

I did a test run on this tart in preparation for Thanksgiving and it turned out great! The crust is flakey (I did it in the processor, rather than by hand). The filling is surprisingly light but rich. I took the advise of the others and decreased the amount of suger, syrup and eggs and think I may not next time. I could have filled my tart shell a bit more.

Reduced sugar and syrup to 1/2 cup each and eggs to 3. Turned out very nice... the caramel was a little difficult as it clumped in the eggs. I had to whisk for a long time to incorporate it. I toasted the pecans first. I will definitely make this again.

It is almost Thanksgiving so it is time to make the tart again. I always start hearing from my family a couple of weeks before, "Momma are you gonna make the tart again?" Do I have a choice. This is so easy and looks and tastes so good. It also makes a nice gift for someone and travels well. One of these days I will have to make the Banana Rum Ice Cream but for now I'll make do with the Vanilla. The one change I do make is to use Maple or Rum extract instead of Vanilla.

The first time I made this (for Thanksgiving) it was wonderful.... However, when I made it again for Christmas, I had problems with the syrup being too hot for the eggs and What A Mess I had. I had to start over. In the future, I'll use the crust recipe, and the melted chocolate. But I think I'll use the recipe on the Corn Syrup Bottle for the rest of the filling. It isn't that different from this recipe, except you don't have to cook the corn syrup and brown sugar before adding the eggs.

I made this for Thankgiving and served it with whipped cream. It was quite a hit. I'll make it many more times

I had a slight bit of trouble with this recipe, and during the hectic holiday season, that's not what I needed! My trouble came when I added the warm caramel to the egg mixture. The recipe said nothing about letting the caramel cool to room temp, or bringing the eggs up to room temp, so when I combined them, to my horror, the caramel immediately clumped. I was using a bowl and a whisk, so I ran and dumped it in my KitchenAid bowl and used the whisk attachment. It eventually came together, but not before the eggs became foamy from all of the beating. This left a foam on top of the tart which overbrowned and looked SO ugly. Everyone who tried it said it was delicious, and my husband who normally doesn't even like pecan pie ate it up, so I guess it was OK. If I make it again in the future, I'll make sure the egg mixture and the caramel mixture is at room temperature before I combine them.

I made this for my family at Christmas, and they loved it! Actually easy to do, but makes a great impression on the eye and the taste buds.

I've made this three times already since downloading the recipe two weeks ago. It's simple, and wonderful. Everyone I've served it to wants the recipe. I do have to say, I have always had egg/sugar mixture left over, so last time I cut it down to 3 eggs, 1/2 cup each of brown sugar and syrup. It worked fine. I think it would also be great with macadamia nuts, I'm got to try that next.

I came bck to epicurious.com because I couldn't find my issue of Gourmet from which I'd originally made this. It's a definite winner!

This is a great holiday recipe or one to make through out the year!! Very easy and tasty. It was a big hit for Christmas, and one I will definitely make again to share with my friends. Hint: It's excellent warmed up and served with vanilla bean ice cream.

Just a wonderful tart! Very sweet and excellent served with vanilla ice cream. We even enjoyed it as a wonderful morning sweet with coffee! I am making it again for a dinner party!
