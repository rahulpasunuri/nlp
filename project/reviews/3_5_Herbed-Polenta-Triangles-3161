I'd make this again because it's so delicious, but I was whisking for about 40 minutes before it even began to thicken enough to 'pull away from the sides'. Great dish though!

This was easy, fast and delicious. Also, it is easy to experiment with, just replace the herbs with whatever flavoring you'd like. I've tried different herbs, adding shredded parmesan, and melting half of the butter and sauteeing some minced shallots before adding the rest of the ingredients.
