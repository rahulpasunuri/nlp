SUPER! My first fruitcake (making and eating), and what a wonderful taste. Did not use alcohol, but still moist and flavorful. I added ginger/candied ginger since we like that flavor. Thanks for this!

My first Fruit Cake ever and so, so marvelous. I ended up making 3 batches this last Christmas! I substituted brandy soaked fresh pineapple for the citron, and used red and green cherries for a Christmas touch. The recipe is perfect for I 6ea 5X3 pans - makes them gift sized. Did not line the pans with foil - only used shortening - worked perfectly.

This recipe is a KEEPER! I always do a trial before I make large batches. It got everything I look for in a fruit cake: good color,moisture,mild liquor taste and a good balance of the spices. I am a well seasoned baker and cooker and definitely recommend this recipe. If you are a beginner don't be afraid it is perfect. I have many years making fruit cakes and all I can say is that this recipe is perfect. I added the brandy sauce that someone posted earlier and it made the cake even better. If you find it not dark enough don't worry the sauce will give that extra little darkness that you may be looking for. Liquor tends to brown the cakes when they are still hot from the oven. Wrap it as tight as you can so the sauce really penetrates the cake. I really love this recipe!

This is a little sweeter than I would prefer, but a nice recipe anyway.

I made this again...was a hit with family and frinds. Made a slight change...since I don't like raisins and pecans, I tried with walnuts and dried ceanberries...was justas good. Does need some pecans for the texture

Absolutely amazing! I've found myself wanting to make it again after the holidays just because its so yummy! I too nixed the candied fruit in favor of assorted dried (figs, dates, currants, crystalized ginger), and used both pecans and walnuts. I think this time I'll try the suggestion of soaking the fruit in brandy first, and perhaps making a brandy glaze (4T butter, 2T water, 1/2 c sugar, boil 5 min over med, stirring; remove from heat, stir in 1/4 c brandy) drizzle over top. A holiday must, but why wait for the holidays?

I onlyused this recipe as a general guideline to recreate a cake I ate years ago so my rating is rather symbolic, but it IS a very nice starting point to make your own fruit cake. My version has no molasses, the juice of an orange instead of lemon extract and loads and load of assorted dried fruit (apricots, plums, dates, raisins and cranberries, walnuts, usually, no candied fruit, ever). I only use just enough batter to hold the fruit together. Oh, and I soak it in brandy, both the fruit and the cake. Just delicious.

I got very positive reactions to this fruitcake, one person even claiming that it was like her grandmother's! I used honey instead of molasses, which made it lighter. I also used only 2/3 c of brown sugar and it was still sweet enough. I will try with more, perhaps different, nuts next time.

How do you go about "soaking the cake in Brandy/rum?" Any advice appreciated! Thanks, Marisol

fantastic. i wanted to eat this the next day for christmas dinner, so I soaked the fruit beforehand in orange brandy (simply covered dried cranberries and currants with the alcohol and microwaved for a minute or two). to make a more elegant dessert, I sliced the loaf lengthwise in three parts, and made it into a layer cake with an airy creamcheese icing (1 pk cream cheese, whipped with whipping cream and a couple tablespoons of confectioners sugar until smooth and airy). before spreading the icing on, I drizzled each layer with orange brandy and garnished the big fluffy mound of a layer cake with wisps of lemon rind. my guests loved it, some claimed it was the best fruitcake they had ever eaten.

WOW!!! this is a wonderful recipe!! It was my first time to make fruit cake and a few were scared but they were the ones that loved it!! I tweeked it a little bit for my taste by using dried apricots,pineapple,c herries and craisins. I also didn't have lemon extract but I had orange oil. This was wonderful right out of the oven and after soaking for a few days in brandy. It's a keeper, thank you!!

My husband is not a fruit cake fan, but this was a hit with everyone! I replaced the candied fruit and citron with an assortment of dried fruits. Excellent.

This is an excellent recipe. So easy to make and the texture was wonderful - not heavy or dry like many fruit cakes I've tasted in the past. I soaked the fruit in brandy for 3 weeks before making the cake, then used the infused brandy to drizzle over the cake when served... and it was an absolute hit.

I will definitely make this cake again, although I dont like fruit cakes this one is really good! I just put the dried fruit of my liking and it turn out great!!! try it.

First of all, I must say, this is the best fruit cake I've ever tasted. Nothing like those frisbee-like things that get passed back and forth every Christmas. Now, a couple of things I would change. I think the cake is just too sweet. Next time I make it, I will definitely reduce the sugars. Also, I think it has a bit too much candied fruit. I would reduce the fruit by half. It seems like more fruit than cake. Instead of lemon extract, I used vanilla - I just love that rich flavor and aroma. For me, this was a very good starting point, easy to personalize.

I made this last year with several substitutions - hazelnuts instead of walnuts, cranberries instead of raisins, and a mixture of chopped dried fruit instead of candied fruit. I soaked the thing in kirsch for about a month. It was fantastic and it disappeared quickly! This is one fruitcake that won't sit around for years.
