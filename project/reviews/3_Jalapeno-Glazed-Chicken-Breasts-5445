DELICIOUS! EASY! WE LOVED THIS RECIPE. I USED ONLY 1/2 TBL. MINCED JALAPENO BECAUSE MY HUSBAND DOESN'T LIKE BURN-YOUR-MOUTH-OUT SPICY FOOD, AND IT TURNED OUT PERFECT. HE LOVED IT AND ASKED ME TO MAKE IT AGAIN. HE GAVE THIS 4 FORKS! THIS IS A WINNER.

I've made this with both Knott's Berry Farm jalapeno jelly and the one I made following Chef Deborah Scott's recipe. My family has liked all versions. Her recipe was printed in the San Diego Union Tribune this year. Since her recipe doesn't use pectin and I don't judge jelly readiness well, my jelly looked like juice, so I used cornstarch to thicken it for this recipe. I didn't add a jalapeno to either jelly, but added more honey to mine - it was very hot. I've used both fresh oregano and fresh cilantro, both very good. I also tried the lime juice, but think that it didn't matter whether I used vinegar or lime for taste purposes. To New York, if you want to make the jelly, I can e-mail you Chef Scott's recipe. Her fried Brie is on this site, too.

Great recipe; I substituted one tablespoon of lime juice for one of the white wine vinegar tablespoons, and sprinkled chopped cilantro on top of the cooked chicken breasts.

I hope the inventor of this recipe dosn't cringe; but i couldn't locate jalapeno jelly, so... i used duck sauce mixed with some jalapeno salsa. Followed the rest of the recipe as it was. Seemed to work out fine, very flavorful. Desperation is the mother of invention!

Increase the vinegar to 1/2 cup, then turn your chicken every two minutes and brush with sauce. You will get a more tender chicken breast.
