Great recipe! I made the cheese burekas for a party and my guests loved them. It's pretty easy once you've figured out the folding technique. One tip: Less butter can be used without sacrificing much on taste.

This is a great recipe! I followed the phyllo dough part of the recipe exactly, but I changed the filling quite a bit. That is what is so great about Burekas; you can fill them with whatever you please. Delicious! Tip: I folded the phyllo dough three times to form a pocket, and then put in the filling and continued folding.

Fun to make and fabulous! Used the recommended spinach filling with a little extra feta, as we're big cheese fans. Had some friends over and everyone took a turn folding. After 20 minutes in the oven, burekas were flaky and tasty. Highly recommended!

Burek is word used everywhere Turks went, I guess. Balkan countries have burek with spinach, potato, cheese and ground beef. In Bosnia last one is the only one considered and called burek, and is the best (if you're not vegetarian). Mix of chopped onion and ground beef with ground pepper and salt is spread over hand made phyllo, rolled and baked. Served with yogurt or kefir.

Had a wonderful time just making them, and recomend using two sheets of phyllo dough. Also, we experimented using feta, exotic cheeses of various designs, and anything else that tastes good on its own. An entire cup of butter is excessive but you must make sure to coat the outside with egg so that it stays together.

A truly authentic and delicious mediterranean dish! I highly recommend it.

This dish is reminiscent of the spanikopitas I love from my favourite Greek restaurants. I made this with spinach, fried onions, garlic and basil for a party and almost everyone demanded the recipe. Try adding your favorite minced cooked meat, cooked rice or beans (great for using up leftovers) or coarsely chopped, hard cooked eggs. For a novel dessert or sweet snack try sweetened Marscapone (any decent supermarket or Italian grocer should have this in stock) and any mild fresh cheese with your preferred dried fruit (raisins, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, whatever) and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before baking. Definitely a keeper and I will make this again. Thank you.
