I agree that this was truly unique. The tanginess of the sherbet caught me off guard at first, but with that tanginess is the just-right caramel flavor, mmm. I used dehydrated cane juice instead of white sugar, which gave the sherbet a good coffee color and probably added to the caramel taste. I also added at least a half a cup of dark chocolate chips and a teaspoon of vanilla. I thought both additions worked very well. One other thing: while this recipe isn't low fat, it is worth noting that it's much lower in fat than regular ice cream, while satisfying the same sweet tooth. Also, I ended up with about a pint and a half of sherbet, at least a full cup more than the approximate yield.

The most unique sherbet that I've ever eaten. Wonderful texture and a flavor that stands alone in the dessert world.You don't have to love buttermilk to enjoy this.
