Had this for Thanksgiving this year and not a crumb left by day's end. Added 1/2 red, orange, green pepper as was concerned about not having enough to go around. Used cornbread from Whole Foods. It was delicious and thoroughly enjoyed by all.

We modified this recipe by eliminating the egg which made it a tad healthier. We loved it and will make it again next Thanksgiving.

Meh. Full disclosure - I had no celery, which I'm sure is a significant contributer to the flavor and texture profile. Still I found this muddled in both taste and texture. I added spices to the cornbread to amp it up - powdered garlic, cumin and chipotle chili pepper. Glad I did or it would have been so bland. I'm gonna try it again with more modifications...include the celery and add some bell pepper and white bread cubes...maybe cilantro. This recipe definitely needs a boost.

I made this for Thanksgiving also, one thing I noticed is the shopping list didnot include conbread, fortunatly I had a box of Jiffy mix which worked out well. I did use about 1 1/4 cup of broth. It was great!

I made this on Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I used cornbread from whole foods that I cut into pieces the night before and put them in a plastic bag to dry, and followed the directions to dry further. Also, I did not add the entire can of broth at once, only about half to begin with then added with the baster as I cooked. It turned out perfect. Thank you !

everyone liked except me, found the corn bread made it too sweet. And if it's not stuffed in something it's not stuffing, it's dressing.

I liked the idea of this dish, but the recipe needs a good bit of tweaking to get a really great product. First, the Skillet Cornbread recipe is just bad... dry, mealy, and flavorless. The result is a finished product that just doesn't really wow. Second, the 4oz of chorizo is not nearly enough. This needs at least double that amount.

How much cornbread do I use? I will get store bought....

I made this last Thanksgiving and will make it again this year. Huge hit! Everyone asked for leftovers.

Excellent one skillet dish. Always preheat corn bread batter in a greased skillet on the surface burner for a few minutes before baking in the oven. Makes for a delicious crusty bread.

4 forks from the Poker Guys, served with Turkey sliced with a smoked gravy. Big Hit!!

If you want to stray from the traditional stuffing by adding some spice to your dinner party, this recipe is it. I did take another cook's advice by added a little extra chicken broth to keep the stuffing moist. It worked. The consistency was just perfect. I served this to 5 Foodies and they all loved it!

Our family loved this dish although we made changes to the corn bread recipe after the first attempt, following the recipe, we found it to be too dry. We used our son's recipe and substituted olive oil for the butter and omitted the egg. We've been eating Spanish chorizo since we were children and love it. Consequently, we added twice the amount call for in the original recipe. It was great and it will become a staple item in our Thanksgiving and Christmas menus from now on.

I strongly recommend the addition of a small can of corn and blackbeans

Delish! Used Soy Chorizo rather than "real" since we're vegetarians here. Came out wonderfully.

this was a huge hit it had an amazing flavour but mine came out dry. It could have done with the fact that I didn't cover it tightly with the foil or I didn't toss the egg/broth mixture. I lost my internet connection and did not read the last part of the directions! I will definately make this again.. but will add another cup of broth and another egg!

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. However, we had to toss the "skillet cornbread" and start over with a better cornbread recipe. The "skillet cornbread" had an undesirable texture and a thick layer of grease...not good enough for the main ingredient. Other than that minor setback, it was delicious! I also used chicken chorizo from Whole Foods that gave it just enough kick alongside the subtle sweetness of the cornbread. So, definitely don't skimp on the chorizo. Once you get the cornbread right, you can't go wrong with this recipe. The flavors work perfectly together. The key to this stuffing would be keeping it moist with a good cornbread recipe. Either way, drizzle it with a little gravy and problem solved. If you're lucky enough to have leftovers, simply reheat and serve with over-easy fried eggs for a yummy breakfast.

I made my cornbread from a Joy of Cooking recipe but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The flavor were delicious but it was a little dry. Next time I would use more stock and possibly another egg.

This was a wonderful recipe. I substituted a box mix of cornbread and dried it as specified in the recipe. I also added some store bought "stuffing" squares to make it a mix of textures, and because it didn't seem like there was enough bread vs. other ingredients. I couldn't find the Spanish chorizo, so I fried up some fresh Mexican chorizo instead, which was delightful. It gave a spicy taste to the dressing that wasn't overpowering. I also added more broth than was recommended so that it wouldn't get dry in the oven. The piece de resistance: I used the scrapings of the chorizo to make a variety on "country gravy." It's listed under Chicken Fried Skirt Steak with Country Gravy. I nixed the cloves and the sage, as the chorizo was spicy enough. The gravy took the flavor of the dressing into the stratosphere. Highly recommended!

Instead of doing the Skillet Cornbread, I used a packaged cornbread mix. Then I crumbled it up and baked it according to the original recipe. I just completed the recipe as written. I received many requests for this recipe by our party's attendees. It went so fast, I had to make another batch so my wife could sample it. Don't be afraid to experiment - that's what cooking is all about!

In response to the cook from Frisco: Click on where it says, "Skillet Cornbread" in the ingredient list. It's a link to the recipe for the cornbread used in the chorizo stuffing.

Although this recipe sounds delicious I did not try it. Corn Bread is not in the list of ingredients nor does it tell you how much to use. Id think that would be a pretty important feature in this recipe.

This is way good! I made it with the adobo turkey recipe also from November 2008. It is a perfect vehicle to soak up all the delicious adobo gravy. I didn't have any chorizo on hand, so I used some jalapeno chicken sausage, which worked really well. I did find I have to bake it a little longer than called for because I wanted it a little crispier, but other than those adjustments, I did it exactly as the recipe called for.
