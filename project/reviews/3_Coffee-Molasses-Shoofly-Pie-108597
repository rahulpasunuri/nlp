This is the worst pie I've ever tasted. The taste of molasses was overpowering and the filling looked unappealing. I am an accomplished baker and followed the recipe exactly, but this pie is not worth the work or the calories!Very disappointing since I've had great success with recipes from this site.

I was disappointed. It looked perfect, but tasted nothing like other shoofly pies I've had before. Very bland - not even the finest ice cream could help this one.

I used the gluten-free four mixture from this site (primarily brown rice four), my own (simple) crust recipe and kept everything else the same. It was amazing! Four full people ate all but one slice the night it was served!$

This was very easy to make, and it tasted pretty good. But I thought this pie was nothing special. I don't regret making it, but I don't think I'll make it again.

One time I made this pie with a few of the wrong ingrediants, just because they were what I happened to have in my house, and the pie turned out AMAZing. The flavor was so much more warm and intense. I used dark brown sugar, dark molasses, and dark corn syrup. Also a warning: be sure to do as the recipe says and prepare the filling while the crust is baking so that the filling can go directly into the hot crust. Otherwise, the bottom layer of the pie will end up all runny... or the pie could end up exploding in the oven.

Nothing to write home about but it is worth trying. It's sort of a cake in a pie shell, but moist and chewy. I could see baking this without crust in a small pan to serve as a crumble. Quite a simple recipe and good results, if a bit bland - do serve it with ice cream. All liked it.

This is truly a great pie. Reminiscent of the Amish made ones I used to eat growing up. It's updated with the addition of the coffee flavor, which is an excellent enhancement. Rave reviews everytime I've served it.
