I think this looks great, and I want the reviews, even from those who tweak, but I do not believe their 'fork' rating is credible, since they aren't rating the actual, original recipe. ** please comment, though, I love the ideas that i get when I am missing an ingredient or two.

I agree that the honey is too sweet for this recipe but found agave sweetner to be an excellent substitute; less sweet and lower on the glycemic index too!

I disagree with the person who doesn't want people who change the recipe to refrain from commenting. I love to read how people may have changed and improved on a recipe.

I wish people who don't follow the recipe would refrain from rating the result as their opinion is irrelevant.

Try grilling baguette slices, spread with fresh Chevre, followed by arugula (tossed first with a bit of good olive oil , honey and balsamic)sprinkle with fresh crackked black pepper. Layer couple of fresh fig slices and top all with crisped prosuitto . So good..

I adapted this for a neighborhood get together. I wanted something easy to eat while standing on the patio so I toasted some sliced baguette, spread it with the cheese/honey mixture, and topped with a slice of fig. It was very pretty and popular (and stretched my figs to serve more people.)

Figs are already very sweet. Adding the honey on top is overkill! The presentation is nice, however.

I took the suggestion of other reviewers and wrapped the cheese stuffed figs with prosciutto and grilled them lightly. Drizzled with honey and pepper, and served over greens. So I guess I made a different recipe, but boy was it good!

This was an excellent combination of flavors. I did not combine the honey and pepper. It was just easier to do that separately. I served over baby mesclun greens.

Such a versatile little recipe! You can use any type of cheese and substitute maple syrup for honey. I loved how quick and packed with flavor this was! Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details.

Delicious and what makes it even better is how quick and easy it is! I did not combine the honey and pepper first, instead I sprinkled the cut figs with pepper, then drizzled with honey straight out of the container (less cleanup!). I put them on foil in the toaster over for 3 minutes at 350 to warm them just a bit and soften the honey and goat cheese.

Overly rich. Figs are incredibly sweet and heavy fruit; the honey seems to be overkill. Pretty colors and easy presentation, but wasn't really a recipe that used the best of what the ingredients had to offer.

This was wonderful, thank you! As an alternative, you can stuff the figs with goat cheese (or sheep) and wrap them in Prosciutto, secure with a toothpick and either BBQ them or bake them until cheese is warm and prosciutto has become slightly crisp. Yum!

This is beautiful, quick, and out of the ordinary. The pepper honey is a delicious contrast. We tried them with both the goat cheese and some Danish blue as suggested by another reviewer. As written they're heavenly, with the slight salty sharpness of the blue cheese, devine!

What a lovely combination of flavors! I made this dish for my husband who loves figs - I never liked them before, but I have been converted! My 9 year old daughter loved this as well. It's insanely easy to make and looks great!

Unbelievably delicious !!!! A great appetizer. I have made this with fresh figs, as in the recipe, and with dried figs when fresh are out of season. For dried, place figs in a large bowl, pour near-boiling water over to cover and let soak about 40 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Pull stem top up a bit to "inflate" the fig. Slice horizontally almost all the way through and insert goat cheese dipped in peppered honey in the opening.

I tried this the first time with goat cheese, and a second time with blue cheese, and it was SOOO much better with blue cheese. You really do need a sharper taste to contrast with the sweetness of the figs and honey. Such a great fresh appetizer!

So easy and so elegant. Guests loved them. Made recipe exactly as stated. Buy the figs the day before or better yet the day of. They don't keep more than 1-2 days. Absolutely will make this again.

Super simple. Super fast. Super appetizer/dessert! Didn't have goat cheese on hand, but had fromage blanc. Yummm. If you happen to have fresh figs on hand and want to wow people with just a tiny bit of effort,this is perfect.

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner I hosted for my friends. They loved it so much! This also gave me the idea to put goat cheese and pepper on top of dried apricots, just as a snack. It's also delicious, I just wouldn't recommend adding the honey because dried fruit is already so sweet.

I loved it! Served it on an anti pasti platter for New Years eve.Some loved it some said don`t bother next time. You can`t please all of them most of the time. I have already made it 2 times since then and still think it does not need any adjustment at all.Peppered honey was the greatest.

10-7-07 Wow. How lovely. I bought 6 figs at a nearby, and following these directions I cut them into quarters but didn't cut all the way through so they sort of opened up like flowers. I was surprised to see they had a beautiful rosy flesh. They were small, so each one held only maybe a half or even a quarter teaspoon nugget of goat cheese. Served on green plates they were absolutely gorgeous-- could have been on the cover of Gourmet. Not only will I make them again, but because I know the fig season is very short here in NJ, I bought some more goat cheese and intend to go back & get some more figs today!

For the cook in DC: the Dupont farmer's market and Eastern Mkt have beautiful figs when in season. But best of all: COSTCO sells gorgeous organic figs in a small case for a decent price. I liked this recipe but it needs an accent.... another great use for figs is with the undisputed king of cheeses, parmigiano reggiano. It gives it that salty taste base with the beautiful depth of parmesan!

Love figs and cheese. For the person in DC looking for figs - I am surprised Whole Foods does not have them but keep checking because they usually do carry them. It could be a clueless employee not realizing they have them. However, Costco does have them and I am sure Wegmans will too.

You can find fresh figs in season at any Middle Eastern grocery store.

Try to find figs at a roadside stand, right off the tree. Soft & ripe. The darker honey (peach orchard) was needed, not wildflower. Not necessary to add the pepper. Serve on baby greens to hide the 'weep' and you'll enjoy!

For the DC cook who asked when to buy fresh figs - they are in season right now. You must have a local farmer's market you could go to (there is a great one in Falls Church). They sell them here at the farm stands in VA Beach, and my neighbors tree is full of them. I couldn't give this any rating since I cannot stand goat cheese; I make mine with with feta or blue cheese, no pepper, bake them at 350 and serve them warm with honey. Better yet, wrap them in prosciutto slices before baking. Yum!

Can anyone tell me the best time to buy fresh figs? I tried to find them the other day at Whole Foods & they looked at me as if I had 3 heads (the employees, not the figs).

I'd give this 3.5 forks if I could. We served this to a gourmet cook guest and her not-so-adventurous daughter as an appetizer. We all raved about it. I could even see it with chevre circles on good baguette slices or crackers topped with a fig compote sweetened with the pepper honey when fresh figs are not available. Sometimes simple and fresh is the best.

I absolutely love fresh figs and am always looking for new ways to prepare them. This dish was pretty underwhelming and bland - I tried it with both calimyrna and black mission figs with equally bland results. The fresh figs would have been better all on their own. Also, if you do make this, I prepared the figs about 30 min in advance of serving, which I discovered makes them "weep" a bit - when I served them they were sitting in a small pool of fig liquid. Serve these immediately if you make them!

the concept was good, but the pepper gave it a funny aftertaste that my guests didn't like. next time, i'll stick with the classic pepper-free version.
