Hubby and I loved this! Stumbled across it by doing an Internet search for steak and asparagus. I made a half recipe of the vinaigrette (I also added some minced garlic & used jarred ginger as another reviewer did) and still had plenty leftover for another use. As some others did, I turned this into a main dish salad by creating a mix of spinach and other greens that I tossed with a little of the dressing. I used my George Foreman grill and also grilled a half bell pepper and some sliced grape tomatoes that needed to be used up. I didn't have fennel seeds on hand so I can only imagine how much better it would have turned out, but it was still great! Now that I have fennel, I'll be esp. eager to make again.

Delicious! Love the vinaigrette -- I subbed the vinegar: half red wine vin and half rice vin. Also subbed jarred ginger paste for the fresh. This is a new family favorite!

I agree with other reviewers that this could easily be an entree but would feed about half as many people. Like others, I didn't use all of the dressing, but it was so good that I'll find a way to integrate it into another recipe. I didn't have red onion or oranges on hand and I used my grill pan on the stove, but it still turned out delicious.

This was superb. I excluded fennel seeds, but that was it. The orange slices are key. I made half the dressing and still had leftovers.

Some confusion... Why make so much spice rub when only 1 1/2 tsps will be used, far less than results from the amounts of whole spices called for? There was quite a bit remaining. And why "sprinkle each side with salt AND pepper," when the steak has already been rubbed with a a powder that is already pepper-laden? Also, the only way I know to keep an onion slice intact on the grill is to skewer it; otherwise, as it cooks, it tends to separate into rings. Skewering is almost impossible with the thin slices the recipe calls for. I just went ahead and made them thicker, skewered them, and cooked them for a longer time.

Made this because we had leftover grilled steak, and all the other ingredients. I didn't call it a salad, which then made it sound better to the husband. Essentially just used the steak with the grilled veggies. Grilled some bread slices & topped 'em with blue cheese as a "side". Because I made the full recipe of dressing, I have to think up a use for it with something else -- hope there's some ideas in the rest of the reviews!

A friend of mine made the steak salad for a garden potluck. It was wonderfull and would recommend making this salad.

What a great salad!! It all came together beautifully. I wasn't sure about the dressing at first but found it to be the component that ties the entire salad together. I tossed a little dressing with a mesculun mix then plated it with the oranges. After the steak and veggies were done I arranged it on top of the greens and oranges. I reccommend seperating the charred onion rings and distributing in the salad. Layering the flavors are a really good idea with this salad.

I am surprised that this recipe didn't receive a 100%. It is a sleeper! It can be made in very little time, and it is really outstanding, especially for carb watchers.

My bookclub ladies loved this recipe. Next time I would use less pepper in the rub, thought it a bit too spicy. Loved the dressing, also added manderine oranges. Great cold as well.

My husband and I made this dish just last night and we LOVED this! The dry spices were exceptionally delicious and I we loved the dressing (don't tell anyone but we were licking the extra dressing off the plates!!!) My bagged salad I had planned on using to make this a quick and simple meal, actually went bad so we didn't do this over a salad but rather a meat and veggie dish and it was great that way as well. Look forward to making this again!!

Oh yum! This was tonight's dinner, and it was fabulous. I followed the recipe completely, and the results were great. I did use my grill pan as it's still cold outside, but I look forward to grilling the meat with those spices. And the smells in my kitchen...fabulous! How fragrant! That vinagrette alone is a winner. I served this on fresh spinach and with Columbia Crest Two Vines Syrah.

I served this as a steak entree, asparagus side, and green salad with grilled onions and tangerine slices. I did not alter the dressing at all and it was delicious. I lightly steamed the asparagus ahead and then grilled it with the steak and onions. I served this for company and it was loved by all.

I've made this a couple times and serve it as a main course rather than a salad. On a bed of lettuce, it makes a filling meal. I omit the chicken stock from the dressing. The dressing has a very bold taste (not subtle, as someone else commented) but I think this matches the beef and asparagus well.

This is absolutely one of the best summer salads I have tasted. Be sure to buy a fairly thick steak so that it slices finely across the grain for serving. Also, 5 minutes a side is too long for medium-rare unless the steak is thicker.

Great recipe as asparagus is in season right now. I did make a change to the recipe and used chicken breast in place of the beef. Also I decreased the amount of hoisin sauce as suggested from previous reviews. I ended up adding the remaining hoisin and didn't think that it was overly sweet at all. Probably depends on what brand you use. Substituted an Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar from Trader Joe's for the white wine vinegar. Also used 2 additional tablespoons of olive oil, as the vinegrette was quite watery. Used canned mandarin oranges. Everything was grilled on my Krups panini grill. We liked it alot and will try it with beef next time.

I agree with the cook from Hong Kong that the hoisin sauce was overwhelming -- cutting the portion to no more than 1/3 cup would make for a more subtle dressing. The dish lacked a balanced flavor & I will be in search of another recipe to try...

This was absolutely delicious.

Though this dish was wonderful, it felt more like a main course meal rather than a salad. The only thing I did differently was toast the spices in a dry heated pan before grinding them. Will make this again.

I had just used the asparagus I had the day before I decided to make this, so I ended up using fresh green beans that I had on hand. Blanched them so that they were tender-crisp and they worked well. Made this dish for a friend who was visiting from out of town and it was a big hit! Can't wait to try it with the asparagus, and I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe - REALLY GOOD!!!! KIMBER

A delicious vinaigrette. Perfect for the ever popular fusion food these days. I found the hoisin sauce a little too overpowering (or too sweet) so i added just a dash more vinegar.

This is the kind of dish that makes anyone feel like a world-class chef. It is nearly impossible to present this dish the wrong way, and the flavors are spectacular. My husband and I thought it was scrum-diddly-icious!

This was excellent! I made it as called for (with the hot chinese mustard) and it was tasty but not too hot. One note: The recipe says it serves 6 -- maybe we are pigs but 3 of us polished it off.

This is an impressive salad that is so easy to make. I also used mandarin oranges and they were a big hit. I tested this out on my husband and we both agreed it would be a good "company" recipe as well.

We took the advice of other reviewers, serving this on a bed of greens and using the mandarin oranges. We completed the meal with garlic bread from the grill, taking most of the preparation out of the kitchen. This was a delicious and light meal that we'll enjoy often throughout the warm weather months.

I love this recipe. So easy and a nice presentation. I decided to use tenderloin steaks for company. I also used the manadarin oranges, just because I happen to love them. I will make this one again and again. A sesame noodle salad was a perfect starch to serve with it. I also decided just to steam the asparagus.

We blanched asparagus spears for 3 min. and chilled in ice bath and dried. Coated with the dressing and served on a platter along with cold sliced mustard and horseradish crusted beef tenderloin. It was a great millenium dish

I admit I was apprehensive because I am not a big hoisin fan. I was pleasantly surprised that this was so delicious! I doubled the recipe and brought it to work for two days for lunch - what a nice change from lunchmeat!

We have made this recipe twice now, and it has become one of our very favorites ! An acceptable shortcut to the fresh powdered spices is McCormick's line of "Grill Mates." We think that the "Spicy Montreal Steak Seasoning" blends perfectly with the hoisin vinaigrette. Can't wait to make it for company !

I never liked red meat until this recipe! It is so quick and easy. We use canned mandarin oranges rather than segmenting oranges to save time. Excellent!

If the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, then this dish has definitely done it! My man raved about this one. I served your "Shrimp with ponzu sauce" as an accompaniment, overtop mixed greens with orange slices. The spice rub is the best feature, methinks. Loved it.

This recipe was yummy and unusual. I used flank steak instead, though, and it worked well. To save time, I blanched the asparagus ahead of time and let it marinate in garlic oil, then just tossed it on the grill for a couple minutes. I also added a bed of mixed greens, and with the orange slices and some sliced tomatoes, it was a beautiful presentation. Great and healthy.
