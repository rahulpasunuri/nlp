This recipe makes FAR more than 6 servings, but it's worth it! It's refreshing on a hot summer's day and really does taste more like cantaloupe than cantaloupe, as at least one other reviewer commented. The only problem I had, however, was that it froze too solid. Not a huge problem for me because I just sliced it into squares and served it on plates that way... it made for an attractive presentation with slices of fresh, locally grown star fruit (carambola) and a few blueberries. Overall, I would make this recipe again, although I might cut it in half. I used Moscato di Asti, a sweet sparkling Italian white wine, to add a little more sweetness because my melon wasn't so sweet. It's a fabulous way to use a less-than-perfect melon and have it come out tasting like it really was a perfect melon!

If you are looking for a cool, refreshing summer dessert (without having to turn on the oven), this is it! Very easy to make and quite flavorful. I used water and followed the recipe to the T. My blender is SUPER strong, so it turned into liquid cantaloupe so there weren't any chunks in it. Served over chopped fruit, it was impressive.
