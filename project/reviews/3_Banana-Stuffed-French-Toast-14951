I do not see why so many reviewers were flummoxxed by this fairly straightforward recipe. I used stale toast bread bought at the convenience store (here in Japan it is sliced an inch thick) and a very ripe banana. It worked perfectly, and was delicious. I also just used regular milk, and didn't measure how much I used. No problems! Yum!

Anyone could make this recipe really tasty with the following tips..... I found that cutting the banana on the diagonal makes the slices fit better in the pocket, as well as covering the entire bread surface. Also, switch the half and half for whole milk, it absorbs better and makes everything less heavy tasting. Also, it isn't necessary to let the bread slices sit for 15 minutes once you switch to the whole milk. Probably 5 minutes would do it. I personally use a non-stick grill pan, which I think make it less susceptible to burning. I topped with drizzled honey and halfed strawberries. This was amazing!!

What a soggy mess this turned out to be. Too much half&half, I'd cut it down to 1/2C if I ever make this again. I would also use berries or some other fruit with a strong flavor if I make it again. Could not even taste the banana. Not worth the effort. My regular french toast gets raves, this one certainly didn't.

wow! what a disaster. i'm a very experienced cook, i worked under the city's 5-star pastry chef. i can make just about anything and this recipe left me completely inept in the kitchen. i even drove a half hour to get the day-old brioche, but it didn't seem to make a difference, i had trouble with the soaking up of the batter, the outside became mush while the inside had yet to get a thing. in the skillet, the bananas never softened, the outside almost had to be burnt in order to be edible and the inside, which i had spooned batter into the middle and it refused to cook, therefore it was just dripping egg, i had to open the bread and serve as regular french toast with bananas & cinnamon on top. nothing like a filled french toast. yuck, can't imagine where other cooks got the idea that it worked out. useless recipe.

I didn't have challah or brioche handy so I used baguette instead and slit each slices so I can stuff the bananas. I didn't like the outcome of this recipe --it was too soggy for my taste. I followed the instructions as is and it took longer than 15 minutes for the bread to soak up the liquid --I even had to discard some. Maybe it's because I'm using baguette. Next time, I'll use the challah or brioche bread instead.

I made this for brunch and got rave reviews. I grilled the banana and just laid it on top of the French Toast. Yum!

You are essentially 'butterflying' the bread... taking a thick slice and slicing through it again in the same direction, making a 'pocket' to hold the banana. As long as the bread is still connected by the crust in at least one place, you're good to go!

This recipe sounds so good. Just wish I could follow the instructions and make it. The description of how to cut an stuff the bread makes almost no sense. Would love a clarification, as the concept sounds d-lish...

This recipe is great! Yes, there is a flaw in the recipe with the preheating, but this is one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever had. Make it for company and they will love you.

Despite the apparent flaw in the recipe (the oven need not be preheated, except perhaps to warm finished toast before serving), I love it -- as does each person who's tried it the 6-7 times I've made it. I sometimes soak the bread overnight, refrigerated, and saute it in the morning, with equal results. Your guests will be inspired.

This has got to be one of the most poorly written recipes I have ever seen. There are other recipes on Epicurious that make a lot more sense and are basically the same thing. I simply love this web site!
