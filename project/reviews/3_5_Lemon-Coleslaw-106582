I love all kinds of slaw. I have now made this one two ways: first, with full fat sour cream and the low fat mayo; second, with reduced fat sour cream and low fat mayo. These differences were just about taking advantage of what was in the fridge. Without a doubt, the regular sour cream/low fat mayo version resulted in the best, creamiest texture. It's not a bad way to go, because it's really not a lot of sour cream at all. The lemony flavors in both are delicious and improve over a day or so. Finally, technique: cut the cabbage with a good knife into small squares. Let it rest, sprinkled with salt, in a colander for about 20 minutes. Press off excess moisture with a towel. Then add the dressing. The dressing will cling and won't be watered down.

I have made this recipe about 5 times now, and it has become my favourite. It took me a long time to find a nice tasting lower fat version of cole slaw. This is an excellent recipe, and I agree with the other reviewers: refreshing. The lemon taste is not overwhelming, and really works with the cabbage.

Whoops, my review was wrong--I did leave out the water--didn't even notice it. Definitely would not add.

I gave this 3 forks because after all it is cole slaw, but what a difference. This could be a side dish for a fish meal also, like the slaw we had at Walt's Fish Shack in John's Pass, FL. I followed the recipe exactly, served to a crowd and it was delicious.

Delicious and very refreshing! I didn't add the water but other than that I made it exactly as written. I'll be serving it with pulled pork and grilled fish.

I've tried several coleslaw recipes and this is my favorite so far. Made it to go with the shredded pork wrap recipe (which is delightful!). I used fresh ingredients, not from a bag (not that I wouldn't if I was in a pinch but you know... it's in a bag) and followed the recipe almost exactly. My husband was sent to pick the parsley out of the garden and also accidentally plucked a bit of summer savory and lemon thyme, so I threw those in as well. It was superior coleslaw experience. I am eager to try the lemon coleslaw with fish and glad to see that others enjoyed this combination.

Because of a diet and limited items in the fridge, I had to change it up a bit. Thanks to those who provided alternate suggestions... Really yummy and fresh! omitted: mayo, water, scallion, parsley. Substituted: yogurt for sour cream added: finely diced radish. delicious!

I really like this healthy slaw recipe. I use either pineapple or orange juice instead of water. It is very refreshing and light instead of the usual slaw which is cabbage mixed with a pound of mayo.

A yummy and different coleslaw! I used some red cabbage for more color and it looked as good as it tasted -- great!

Great slaw to go with the shredded pork (included in that recipe). Would be very unlikely to serve as a stand-alone slaw. Saved some time with bagged slaw and bagged shredded carrots.

This coleslaw is a great variation of traditional coleslaw. Per other reviewers comments I eliminated the water and used a little bit of pinneapple vinegar and cilantro instead of parsley. I added it to toasted blackened mahi mahi sandwhiches. Fantastic! the next day the coleslaw was still very good, but a little bit of extra liquid had accumulated which I drained off. Still very good. This recipe is a keeper.

As amended, this was a great cole-slaw... I used a red-cabbage, regular Sour Cream and Mayonaise, 6 teaspoons of lemon juice and no water. Didn't add the scallions or parsley either. This imparted a great balance of creamy and tanginess. This will be a staple recipe for me.

I'm with Casa Grande. The dressing was pleasant but very watery. The green onion was unnecessary and odd, and the parsley turned into ragged, limp shreds of blackish green vegetable material in about two minutes.

I was not very impressed with this recipe. I followed it exactly, except for using regular mayonnaise and sour cream. The dressing was very watery. After I refrigerated the slaw for an hour as directed, it was almost starting to get soggy. I liked the lemon flavor, but it did not have the crunch that I was looking for. Using less water or more mayo/sour cream might help. However, I won't bother making this again. There are many other side dish or salad recipes that are much better.

An excellent slaw recipe, very refreshing. I usually increase the amount of sour cream to equal the amount of mayonnaise to make it a bit creamier.

I don't often give four forks but this recipe is really good. For those who thought it too lemony, perhaps you didn't use fresh lemon juice. Bottled juice tends to be too acidic and just doesn't compare with the freshness of fresh juice, especially where the flavour is a main ingredient, as in this dish. I didn't know coleslaw could be so good - most are too sweet and gooey. This is just perfect.

This was very lemonly and refreshing--served it with grilled fish and zuchini. A great addition to a summer menu. I used the Italian parsley, but next time I think I'll try fresh dill instead. I also used the packaged slaw mix and lemon juice for half of the water.

Yummy!! I also subbed in extra lemon juice for the water. Makes for a very lemony slaw, but very refreshing. I used an 8oz bag of pre-sliced coleslaw mix from the grocery store and the dressing was the perfect amount. I also skipped the scallions and parsley as didn't have any on hand. This is an easy recipe to make vary, and defintely a keeper.

I love this - not too wet and mayonaissey, great with seafood on the grill, and a little extra black pepper.

Nothing special, anyone could have conceived it. Apart from that, I thought the green cabbage was a bit stringy uncooked. When using raw cabbage, I believe savoy cabbage is a better option.

This was great fresh alternative to slaw! I usually don't like slaw made with mayo and other "white" products - too sweet, too heavy, and not enough bang for the buck. Here I actually liked it. I think the restrained amount of sugar, sour cream and mayo was excellent. I used the full fat version and everyone loved it. Think the lemon was an especially nice touch. Really added a freshness and it wasn't bitter. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Have made this wonderful recipe several times. On the 2nd try I used original Hellmann's and it really did make a difference. The 3rd time I was out of sour cream and substituted low-fat vanilla yogurt (Stonybrook Farms), omitted the sugar and substituted cilantro for parsley. My guests declared it the best slaw they'd ever eaten. It's wonderful in the Shredded Pork Wraps (Gourmet, June2002).

Dear cooking Friends, Please don't ruin this recipe by using low-fat or reduced calorie mayo - they taste awful and are full of sugar. The best mayo is "Trader Joe's" or Hellman's/Best Foods. Also, go eaasy on the zest, if you get any of the white pith in it, the slaw will turn bitter very quickly. I have made this at my hostesses' request at every event I've been to in the past 4 months. People were dancing around the table. Key is good mayo and careful on the zest.

i served this on the 4th of july instead of the usual mayo heavy coleslaw - reviews were 50/50 - some loved it others hated it - personally, i think is a nice refreshing change i think i'll stick to the eastern carolina style we normally eat... while it was fine to serve once - it's not really a big time keeper -

I loved it and will use this coleslaw recipe again, even without the pork wraps. I'm not big on sweet slaw, which you find so often here in the South. People tend to dump sugar in it and drown it in mayo. This recipe is light, refreshing, and plenty moist if given at least a half hour to absorb the flavors. I used a bag of angel-hair cabbage instead of shredding my own, and the quantity was perfect (for the dressing). I also used fresh cilantro (just a touch) instead of parsley because I didn't have any parsley on hand. This dish was yummy!

Thought it tasted wonderful and was also impressed with the appearance, the different shades of green and the bright orange of the carrots. Used some Napa cabbage as well. Made with pork wraps and loved it on its own as well.

With the exception of using full-fat sour cream and mayo (I wasn't about to buy the other stuff for one recipe) and using cilantro instead of parsley, I followed this exactly. It was terrible. I will definitely stick with my husband's coleslaw. We will, however, start adding cilantro. Thanks to the cooks who suggested it.

Perfect with the pork, wrapped in wheat or corn tortillas. I also substituted cilantro for parsley. Next time I'd use an oil-vinegar dressing, but the lemon flavor is excellent.

Unique flavors, simple to prepare, and a light refreshing side dish to most summer-time entrees. I used fat-free mayo and sour cream because that's what I stock. Several reviewers mentioned that there wasn't enough dressing. I bought a bag of preshredded cabbage and used 3 of the 4 cups along with the other ingredients and and it was adequately moistened. Next time I'll try it with cilantro vs parsley as suggested.

The lemon adds a refreshing brightness to an old stand-by. I found that the dressing mixture wasn't quite enough to lightly coat all the cabbage, so I added a bit more sour cream, mayo, etc. I used reduced fat versions of those things, rather than the non-fat, and sprinkled in a few celery seeds. For some reason, this didn't keep very well though. It was great the day I made it, but the next day it became bitter, and the day after that it turned brown and had to be thrown out. I kept it cold and covered, so I don't know why this happened, but I was disappointed, as it makes quite a big batch, most of which went to waste.

Not bad for low fat, it definitely needed more dressing, though. I made it with the pulled pork wraps and it went very well. I added extra zest and lemon juice and sugar.
