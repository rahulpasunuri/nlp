This was simple to make and delicious. I found it to be a little too oily, but it's fantastic in that it does not remind me of a vegan dish, with all the umami flavours. I recently started consciously reducing my meat intake by limiting meat to certain days. Tomorrow is a meat day, so I am thinking to enjoy this with some salmon fillet if I can get my hands on some at the market...

I love this recipe and don't find it to be bland at all. I serve it as a side with steak and green salad. I chop/blend the pine nuts in a spice grinder which creates a better paste than when I've just chopped the nuts. I also halve the oil and have never had to add the extra pasta water.

The salsa does not seem to meld with the pasta well, even after cooking them together. Maybe the salsa needs to be pureed, rather than finely chopped. Do use less oil.

I'm with the reviewers who said this was bland. I added 1 minced garlic clove, juice from 1/2 lemon, and crumbled feta cheese. With these additions it was OK, but nothing I would bother making again.

I made this last night. I added garlic and sauteed prawns as someone's suggestion. I think that without the garlic and prawns it would have been a bit bland. It was very easy to make though, and will make it again.

When I tasted the salsa on its own I was worried the flavour was too strong, but it was perfect when mixed with the pasta. Next time I make this I will use about half the olive oil though. It was far too oily for me.

Just a good, simple meal. I add about 1/4 cup of sun- dried tomatoes and some garlic. I put the olives, tomatoes, pine nuts, garlic, parsley and pepper flakes in the food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Stir in the capers and olive oil and you're done. Sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan.

This is easy, easy easy. And very good!! It is now a family favorite-- even my picky, vegitarian daughter loves it.

I've made this several times for myself, loving it every time. But it's so easy to make, I felt almost guilty serving it at a dinner party. I did it anyway, and EVERYONE loved it. I disagree with the other user; it's nowhere near bland. Try kicking up the hot pepper flakes, or adding more olives. Oh - good olives are key. No canned stuff.

yes, it's easy, but pretty bland. I added garlic shrimp and still it was boring. Not a keeper for me.
