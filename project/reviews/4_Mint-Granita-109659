I was looking for a vegan dessert for my son and while testing this, my husband noted how close this was to a mint julep. WOW! We make this with a tiny bit more sugar and put it in a chilled martini glass with a shot of Maker's Mark and it was delightful. It was great and I'm making a quadruple amount for the 4th! We grow mint and I probably used more than was called for. Yum!

I really liked this, but my husband was not that crazy about it. I found it refreshing and different. I think I would add a little less sugar next time.

This was delicious! I added the zest of the lemon as well as increasing lemon juice to 3 Tblsp. I served this alongside a pasta dish made with peas, mint, and lemon. It was a great pallette cleanser and all were delighted with it!
