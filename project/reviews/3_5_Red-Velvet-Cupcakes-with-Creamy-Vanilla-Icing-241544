6 tbs of food coloring is unnecessary and adds nothing but more undesirable ingredients. This is all show and no taste or texture

I had to use flour instead of cake flour so I thought perhaps the cake was a wee bit dry because of that. Also, I had only 3.5 TBS of red food color but the cake was still quite red to my pleasant surprise. I'm wondering if anyone has an even better recipe otherwise this recipe is alright.

This is a great recipe for red velvet cupcakes. The frosting is also amazing! There is an error in the cupcake recipe. Add 1 1\2 cups of butter or 3 sticks of butter and NOT 1 1/2 sticks. Good luck!

My daughter saw so many cupcake wars, she became obsessed with Red Velvet. So for her birthday I made these cupcakes - we have never found another Red Velvet cupcake (from a recipe or a bakery) that tastes as good as these. Go with the suggested frosting - you need to plan ahead, but it's worth every bite!! Now this is our go-to red velvet recipe I have to make every year.

This recipe was just OK. As others have mentioned, without the icing the cake has no taste. It was dense, which I liked but was dry and bland.

Baked cupcakes in heart-shaped silicone molds. For the food coloring, I used Betty Crocker Gel Food Colors- 1 tsp. gel disolved in 6 tbl. of water equals the 6 tbl red food coloring that is called for. The frosted and sprinkled cupcakes were valentine treats for neighbors. :)

I didn't have time to read the reviews, so followed the recipe as written. The cupcakes were dry and a bit on the chewy side. It took me 23 minutes for the cakes to be ready. Will look for another red velvet cupcake recipe. Had such high hopes since I made them for Valentine's D. The icing was tasty, and went well with the cupcake. I don't think a cream cheese icing would have complimented the cupcake.

I forgot - I halved the icing recipe and it was more than enough for about 20 cupcakes.

This is a great recipe at altitude. These cupcakes still rose quite nicely at 6000 feet. For those at altitude: the first time I made these I used only 1 teaspoon of baking soda which gave very light, airy cupcakes that bordered on the dry side. The second time I accidentally used 1 teaspoon (plus a pinch) of baking powder, resulting in a much more dense, moist cake. The cocoa flavour doesn't come out at all so next time I'll try doubling the amount of cocoa. The icing is simply fantastic. I highly recommend using a real vanilla bean - adds those beautiful black flecks and a lovely, subtle crunch.

I've noticed that baking in different climates will produce different results, even with the same recipe. I found that the original recipe was on the dry side, and wasn't very flavorful. I ended up adding 3/4 cup sour cream, for moisture, and increased the amount of cocoa by 3 Tbs. I actually used this recipe for whoopie pies, by baking the 1 Tbs sized mounds on a parchment lined sheet pan at 350 degrees for 8 minutes. sandwiched with cream cheese frosting, these babies were a hit :)

I think this makes a wonderful cake that always elicits rave reviews ... and seconds. I agree that it is the icing that makes it spectacular. One way to cut back on the cost is, if you happen to be in the South, buy your red food dye there. I bought a 16 oz. bottle of Sauer's red color in South Carolina and I still have many red velvet cakes to go. Beat's the hell out of buying batches of tiny bottles of red food coloring.

I had great luck with this recipe. I made these for a benefit and it was a huge hit. I agree with another reviewer, the frosting is exceptional and in fact, without it, the cupcakes wouldn't have been worth the effort, the frosting is what makes these really great. Yes, it was time consuming and a lot of work but I was asked to make these for a wedding!

These cupcakes are very good. After reading several reviews I used margarine instead of butter (to get a moister cupcake) and I finished them with a vanilla simple syrup (because I like very moist cupcakes). I also prefer cream cheese frosting - so I skipped this vanilla frosting. My family really enjoyed them.

Mmmmm, these taste nothing like they do at Magnolia Bakery. They're not particularly chocolatey, or sweet. They don't really taste of anything, except maybe a little vinegar. Pretty disappointing considering the time and effort they took to make. I'm not sure if I'll even bother making the icing...

Made mini cupcakes from this recipe without the cocoa but added chocolate chips to the batter just before popping them into the oven. This recipe made about 100 minis. They were a hit and incredibly cute even without frosting (which resulted in everyone eating more as they felt less sinful...)

Can someone tell me why the icing comes out looking oily? I've made it three times. The first two it was perfect. The last time the icing looked oily and shinny, as if it had separted a bit. It didn't taste nor feel oily. IT tasted great. But it just looked strange. Was the milk mixture not cool enough, did I over beat the butter?

We thought these were lame. I have been using the Ad Hoc mix (Thomas Keller via Williams Sonoma) to rave reviews. I thought I could do better on my own with this recipe. WRONG! First of all the color alone costs as much as the mix as you need 3 bottles of it at about $5.00 a bottle. The cupcakes were more like muffins in taste and texture. I only made one pan of 12 and threw the rest of the batter away. I know I measured correctly because I did not have enough flour so I measured it again after I purchased new flour. The recipe was kind of a lot of fuss and the results were red muffins. I think Magnolia is over-rated and a media/tourist circus so I guess it's no surprise I didn't like these either.

Rating: 4
Moist, tender and very red. I ended up with enough batter for 36 cupcakes! I'm not sure if that was because I whipped the batter so much that it was very fluffy, but even so, I think this recipe will make more than 24 cupcakes. In case you are wondering, 6 Tbsp of food coloring is 2 fl. oz., which is two small bottles!

After reading reviews I was a bit nervous about making these but it was worth the effort. Amazing and I did not have any of the problems that some others had. I did not have cake flour so I reduced the amount of all purpose flour by 2T per cup. Came out perfect, great color,tase and texture. Icing was the perfect match, not too sweet and not gritty at all. Will make again and again.

This was a fun recipe to make! The end result looked gorgeous but was missing the flavor and moisture that I expected. Still- they went fast when I brought them to work! I will add some vegetable oil next time for sure, and more cocoa powder. I will definitely make this again (with minor changes). Thanks for the fun recipe!

I admit I have never tasted an "official" red velvet cake so I had no pre-conceived notion of how these should taste. While the end result was moist, I found them to be slightly sour.. vinegar-y. Perhaps that's part of their appeal to some but I didn't care for it at all and wouldn't make them again.

Due to this recipe, I became the cupcake girl at the party. I actually MADE the best cupcakes I have ever had! I paired this with an easy sweet vanilla icing, and next time will make these cupcakes with cream cheese icing. These cupcakes take a ton of food coloring, which is expensive (but worth it if you want to impress someone). The red food coloring can get everywhere if you are not careful. MAKE THESE! Also top with either flaked coconut or flaked white chocolate and brace yourself for compliments.

Good but not great. I am an experienced cake maker and followed this recipe exactly. The cake was neither as moist nor as flavorful as other red velvet cakes I've made in the past. Sorry, Epicurious, but Cooking Light's cakes are better than this one!

These were quite possibly the best red velvet cupcakes we have ever had. Moist, rich and a beautiful deep red. I did change the recipe a touch - - Reduced the flour by 2 tbsp and increased the unsweetened cocoa by 2tbsp. - I was about 1 - 1 1/2 tsp short of red food coloring so I added about 1 tsp almond extract and about 1 tsp of water. - reduced the sugar by about 1/4 cup - used 99% egg white instead of whole eggs - 1 cup of the liquid from the carton Followed the rest of the instructions and the result was delicious! I guess my cupcake tins were a bit larger then normal as the recipe yielded 18 cupcakes for me.

These cupcakes are a huge hit every time, and always turn out beautifully. I halve the recipe for the cupcakes and frosting, and follow the directions exactly, except for adding some coffee. I've also made it as a triple-layer cake, which turned out beautifully also.

I've rated and reviewed this recipe before, but wanted to add that I just won the Blue Ribbon at the Kentucky State Fair with this recipe. As per other comments and my own earlier review, I added a little more cocoa, reduced the flour to compensate and added some espresso powder. I used most of the bottle of red gel coloring (the kind you use in royal icing for cookies) and the color was a very nice russet. The creamy vanilla frosting is the perfect frosting for this cake - make it exactly like the instructions and it comes out perfectly.

Terrific! My daughter and I made these today and discovered the cupcakes were great even without frosting (we just had to try one...). Found recipe makes about 32 cupcakes just like another reviewer noted. We also found that 2 1 ounce bottles of red food coloring gave us about 5 tablespoons of liquid. Added 1 T of water and still had a great deep red color.

These took alot of butter and careful timing. I read the recipe beforehand and had high hopes. I made them as cupcakes so I was sure to watch my time so they didnt overbake. Disappointed is a mild word to describe how I feel about these. They took precision timing and for what? A texture like that of a foam cushion, on the dry side and not much flavor other than a vinegar aftertaste. I even subjected family to try them....they agreed. No, I won't be making these again. Now the frosting recipe that you can click into at the bottom of this recipe? THAT"S A KEEPER!!

I always prefer to use butter in baking, rather than oil, so I was happy to find this recipe. Many stores now carry convenient 1C and 2C cartons of buttermilk. By making 2/3 of the recipe I yielded 21 regular-sized cupcakes, which was perfect for my friend's dinner party. I only had 1T of old fashioned red food coloring, but used water for the rest, rinsing the coloring bottle to get every drop of red I could into the batter. The cupcakes were still a lovely light red color. I also made a cream cheese frosting, as I preferred the extra tang and contrast to the subtle cake.

Never again. I'm an experienced baker and used this recipe to make two 9" by 13" layer cakes. (I did not double the recipe but instead made it twice, just to be sure.) The cakes tasted pretty awful -- weirdly floury, sweet but not in a good way. There isn't much cocoa flavor, which might be the point in a red velvet cake but to me is more of a liability than an asset. For the second cake I added a tablespoon of cocoa, which improved the flavor marginally. But really, I thought both cakes were terrible. (The technique of adding baking soda and vinegar at the end seems extremely weird to me.) Side note: Despite using 6 tablespoons of food coloring, the cake appeared a light brown. (Not blaming the recipe for this one -- maybe it's because I used a type of natural food coloring I found at Whole Foods, since the Center for Science in the Public Interest recently published a report about how horrible food dyes are for you.) I hoped this cake would be red for my child's birthday, but oh well. On the bright side: The accompanying icing is excellent, and the video showing how to make it is very helpful. But be warned: the icing melts easily.

FABULOUS! I've never baked anything from scratch (besides some chocolate chip cookies) and this came out really beautiful. I made the cupcakes for 4th of July and my boyfriend's birthday and they came out truly lovely. The batch made me 32 cupcakes and I had a lot of left over icing, as well (which was equally fantastic!). Thanks Epicurious!

This is a really great recipe and the end product, with the frosting, is fantastic.

First time I made this recipe- Red Velvet anything and it turned out really really well. I followed the recipe to exactly what it said, though I did have an issue of having only 3 tablespoons of red food coloring instead of 6 because I underestimated the amount the food coloring in the bottle- but what I did was I actually compensated by replacing the remaining 3 tablespoon of red food coloring with 3 tablespoon of water and it turned out fine- not as red, but still red. Also, I used this recipe not as a cake but as cupcakes instead. I placed it on the third rack of my oven @ 350F and left it in there for 24 minutes and it turned out moist and fluffy! No needing to rotate or adjust. This also works really well with the Creamy Vanilla Frosting as well- suggest you do both and you will be happy! :)

I made these in my Thermomix, so followed the ingredients and not the instructions. I beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, added the eggs one at a time, then the cocoa and red food colouring mixture, then added dry and wet alternately in two batches with the vinegar soda in the end. This is a beautiful colour. It is a lovely texture. It is not dense and it is not light. It is perfect in weight. But, the flavour was not exceptional. It was delicious (3 forks) and really missed the mark on the exceptional in taste. I am tasting it without the icing. When I breathed deep into the cupcake to smell it (I know, who does that?), it had an ammonia scent which scared me a little (not for long, but a little). It was odd for it to smell like that. Maybe the food colouring? This batch is HUGE. It made 8 dozen mini cupcakes. Now, for the icing. I haven't made it yet.

In response to LittleBuddy from California, your cupcakes may have turned out dry because in making 36 instead of 24 each one would have been a smaller volume of batter and thus baked more quickly.

The cake is so delicious, moist and beautiful. I made regular size cupcakes and mini-cupcakes to have small bites for people at a birthday party. I could not find the courage for the icing; maybe next time. The amount of red food coloring seems right, too. I've seen other recipes with 1/3 the amount (?). The preparation process in this one is unique, so it was fun to try a new method.

I loved this recipe. It was moist and very delicious. The icing was mmm...mmm.. good. I followed it to a "T" and everything was perfect. I really enjoyed making it. I love to bake anyway. I made this cake before from a different recipe and it turned out dry. It tasted good, but dry, nothing compared to this one. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I will make this again, that's for sure. For the negative comments about this recipe, maybe you need to follow the whole directions correctly.

I followed this recipe almost exactly - I cut it in half because I only needed a dozen cupcakes for a luncheon. After reading the reviews - after measuring the flour, I took out a tablespoon and added one extra tablespoon of cocoa. I added one teaspoon of espresso powder. These were splendid! I've not been a fan of red velvet cakes - they always tasted bland to me but I had a request to make them. It ended up making 15 cupcakes. They were moist and flavorful. The Creamy Vanilla Frosting was wonderful - made it exactly as the recipe (except for cutting it in half) and I had plenty of frosting and a little left over. I'll have to add these to list of treats to make often.

This recipe was great! I followed the recipe to a T (3/4 cup butter as in recipe) and the cupcakes and frosting turned out amazing. I didn't find the cupcakes dry at all and people actually commented on how nice and moist they were. The frosting was to die for, I'd never had butter frosting before. I thought it would be heavy and sweet but it was actually quite light. This was my first time baking anything from scratch; I had fun and was impressed with the results. It's time consuming but pretty easy to make.

The actual cake in a red velvet cupcake is decidedly unremarkable- it's the frosting that is larger than life itself. (not the cream cheese type). When I first had one at a farmer's market- I couldn't figure out if it was an impossibly stable vanilla whip cream- which I'm pretty sure defies the laws of nature. I tried this recipe and had never heard of the weird milk and flour step (which when it cools looks like an enormous glue stick from kindergarten). But when you add it to the creamed butter and sugar, it disintegrates all the grainy sugar granules and turns the pale yellow color bright white! This is it folks- follow the instructions exactly and you'll have a superior frosting far easier, and I think, better than any of those complicated meringue ones. Brought these as cupcakes to a Thanksgiving dinner for the kids and the parents still call for the recipe years later!

i'm not a huge fan of red velvet, but i thought these were pretty darn good. i made these for a client and they said that they were fantastic. i noticed in the reviews below, that some people are adding more cocoa or wanting more cocoa. understand that adding cocoa will dry out your cake, especially if you take away any sugar, which is a moisture component. if you decide that you want extra cocoa, take out the same amount of flour, maybe even a tiny bit more. hope this helps anyone out there!

My friends and I have been having this Red Velvet addiction after eating them from a local gourmet bakery, Sprinkles. Except we pay $3.00 for each cupcake, personally I thought it was overpriced. So when i saw this recipe I had high hopes espcially because it's from a well known bakery in NYC. Even with all the bad reviews I still wanted to make it. I followed the recipe as described, the cake was okay, I personally think it needs a bit more cocoa. And the frosting was not what I expected. I knew it called for 4 sticks of butter, my gosh every bite made me feel like I was about to have a heart attack!! Way too much butter, I was hoping it was a lighter tasting frosting, but I guess not. I think I'll stick to the Sprinkles Red Velvet cupcake for now and pass on this recipe. If you're in Orange County, California gotta try Sprinkles, Red Velvet.

I don't usually like red velvet cake but I made this recipe as cupcakes and loved it. Cupcakes are very light and you can taste the chocolate notes. I made it with two separate icings and wish I hadn't used any. My cream cheese icing overpowered the cake. I made the creamy vanilla icing used in this recipe and didn't like it at all. It's a lot of work for rather boring icing. I will make this cake recipe again and serve it plain with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and homemade sour cream ice cream.

This recipe makes enough batter for way more than 24 cupcakes...but it was late at night, and I was too tired to stay up long enough to bake another pan-full. The cake comes out very fluffy and moist. I was hoping for a slightly more "dense" texture. Also, I think the recipe could've used more cocoa and/or sugar. They tasted pretty bland. I probably won't be making these again.

Since I didn't watch the video (or read the comments) I used the 1 1/2 sticks of butter as directed. I also did not use the full amount of food coloring, instead I used 1 TBSP of food coloring and 5 TBSP of water. It was plenty pink colored for our purposes. I made 12 cupcakes and one 10" round cake with the batter. The cake was delicious, very tender and moist, probably the best cake I've made from scratch. The cupcakes were too delicate to handle and fell apart. The frosting, is, well, over the top. I would cut the frosting recipe in half and use it quite sparingly, because the cake has plenty of flavor and gets overwhelmed with the heavy butter frosting. Overall, I'd make this again, but I wonder about changing butter because mine turned out so well.

I didn't get a chance to view the video before I made these, but as per other reviewers, I used 3 sticks of butter (1 1/2 cups). I also switched the pans midway through.

I used the 1.5 CUPS of butter (3 sticks) used in the video and the cake was delicious. I only had about 4 tablespoons of red food coloring on hand and so made up the difference with a little water and the cake was extremely red. Next time I think I'd swap a couple tablespoons of the flour with a bit more cocoa to punch up the chocolate notes a bit more. A full recipe was just right for a 9x13 and didn't spill over the top. That took about 40 minutes to bake.

The batter was so delicious! It lost something of the subtlety of the cocoa flavor after baking, but I blame that on my blind following of the baking time. I think they were done after 15 minutes. I used mascarpone frosting topped with a cocoa powder heart and then ate about a dozen of them over the next few hours. As other reviewers said, I also got 3 dozen cupcakes from this recipe.

I just finished making these after reading most of the comments. I believe that the written recipe is incorrect for the amount of butter. It should be 1.5 cups of butter -- as indicated if you watch the video. So, mine turned out fantastic. I even halved the recipe and got 12 very generous sized cupcakes which were fluffy and delicious. You can skip the red food colouring if you wish -- no big deal. I think next time I will make mini cupcakes !!

These cupcakes turned out OK for me however I hadn't noticed the amount of food color the recipe called for until I was well into it. I used the two small bottles that I had on hand which worked fine but at the price of food coloring these could be pretty expensive cupcakes if you use the full 6 Tablespoons called for.

I made a third of the listed recipe, which was just enough for six jumbo cupcakes.

I divided this recipe by a third to make about 10 cupcakes. I used double the amount listed as per the instruction video, and the cupcakes turned out lovely and moist (but not oily). I iced them with cream cheese icing and they were delicious!

I made this recipe for friends and they absolutely loved it. I don't eat this type of cake but the batter was moist and tasted good. It makes way more than 2 doz cupcakes. This is the ONLY recipe I will ever use. I have made 4 cakes with this recipe. People are giving my cakes and cupcakes as gifts.

I made the cupcake version. Absolutely perfect. Switched the pans midway as instructed. Used extra red food coloring per one reviewer. Delicious. Just use a different frosting as the "creamy vanilla" should say "heartattack frosting" instead.

This turned out delicious! Just the right tang from the buttermilk with a mild cocoa flavor. I did cream cheese frosting instead. I did one stick butter creamed with 8 oz cream cheese, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and one pound confectioners sugar. It was fabulous and I have had rave reviews ever since.

What a great recipe! I made teh cake followed the directions exactly, using whole milk, regular buttermilk (not the lowfat) and fresh eggs. Very very good! It was one of the best cakes I have ever made.

I tried this recipe following the directions given in the video AND the recipe here and they turned out PERFECT!!! I MUST note that the amount of butter that she uses on the video, 1 1/2 Cups, is the correct amount of butter. DO NOT use only 3/4 cup of butter. They will turn out too dry. I baked these the night before my sister's baby shower, set them out on paper towels to absorb some of the oil on the bottom of the cakes, and frosted them the next day. I did not use her frosting recipe (seemed like too much butter) and instead used Paula Dean's Cream Cheese frosting, and they were delicious!!

This was a hit at my daughters birthday.I made a cake instead of cupcakes, it was my first red velvet cake! I found it easy to make and loved watching the video while I baked. (I'm a visual learner) :) The cake looked beautiful, just like I bought it from a bakery and tasted better then any cake I have made before. The icing was different and delicious. I even had people ask for the recipe of the icing. Make it! you'll love it!

I have made this recipe for 35 years & have never had a problem, you definitely need to use cake flour & sift the flour. I am known for making birthday cakes & this is the one my 3 children always want for their birthdays. The frosting is a must, it really makes the cake. Have never had a problem with the cake being dry or the frosting being greasy. You do need to refrigerate the cake.

I'm not sure why so many have an issue with this cupcake; I have made these cupcakes several times and they've always been wonderful and very well received. I follow the recipe almost exactly, except I use a 1oz bottle of red food coloring rather than 6 TBS. My cupcakes have never been dry and my frosting has never tasted greasy...I'm not a professional, just someone who is picky but does like to bake and these are some of the best cupcakes I've ever made.

I have made this cupcakes four times and people love it!! Everyone asks for the recipe and can't get over how simple it is to bake. The creamy vanilla icing is my children's favorite icing! I made 40 cupcakes for my girl friend's 40th - easy as pie! My daugther says yum, yum, yum!!

Ugh. I don't know what happened but I just finished making 2 doz. of these and they're TERRIBLE! I live right down the street from Magnolia Bakery and what I just made are no where near what they have at the bakery. These cupcakes are tasteless and the centers sunk when I took them out of the oven. I had high hopes for making these at home. Completely awful! I guess I'll have to go to the bakery to get my red velvet cupcakes...

I too was surprised by the many poor reviews this recipe received. I prepared the cupcakes and frosting precisely according to the recipe instructions with great results. Because I was baking with the company of three young children I decided to multiply the frosting by half so as to have enough for tasting and piping decorations. This turned out to be a wasted effort as we had loads of leftover frosting, even though the recipe yielded three dozen cupcakes.

The creamy vanilla icing is my favorite icing of all! and I have try many. I have made this cupcakes three times so far and people love it!! I am at high elevation so I am still having some problems to make the tops rise a little more, but other than that this cupcakes are one of my favorites!!!

I made these for a superbowl party and not many made it on location. They're not overly sweet and the texture is extremely light. They're work to make, but delicious.

I don't really know why this recipe got so many bad reviews...I tried it and they turned out great - especially the frosting - which was a little sweet for my taste. A cupcake is still just a cupcake - not a fancy french pastry so it should be appreciated for what it is. All of my tasters enjoyed it as well.

As a previous reviewer noted, the butter measurements are incorrect. I assume it was a typo. Either way, if you want good red velvet cake, use the recipe right out of joy of cooking. It's a good one.

These cupcakes were light and tasty. I even added a little blue to make purple cupcakes for my neice. Cupcakes definitely bake for closer to 18-20 min even if you only have 1 pan in the oven

I really wanted to try a Magnolia Bakery recipie before buying the book and see what the fuss was all about. I added more butter as suggested, but the results turned out to be REALLY GREASY. I was not expecting anything low-fat, but it was just very oily. The flavor is excellent though... and quite simple to make. Next time I will use 2 and 1/2 sticks of butter. The icing was also very very greasy. I piped the icing on the cupcakes, and the grease just seeped through my piping bag... not good AT ALL, totally think it is over- rated. I even used vanilla beans to make it extra- special, but was not worth it. There probably is a more successful red velvet cupcake recipie out there... If you have it, let me know!

This recipe is COMPLETELY wrong. Whoever did this should be banished from bakers heaven. I bake red velvet cakes on a daily basis and just by looking at this it is COMPLETELY wrong. 1 tbsp Cocoa powder 1 1/2 cup sugar 2 1/2 cup cake flour 4 eggs 1 cup buttermilk 1/2 tsp salt 1 tsp baking soda 1 tsp vinegar 1 oz red food coloring 1 1/2 cups crisco oil 1 tsp vanilla Mix dry ingredients together and sift USE THE FULL 1 1/2 cup of oil put this into a bowl. Mix with sugar and add eggs one at a time until mixture is light and fluffy. Alternate flour mixture with buttermilk. Add red food coloring and stir in. THEN use mixer to completely blend in to prevent splattering. Add 1 tsp vinegar last when completely mixed DO NOT OVERMIX! Will make 2 9" cakes. This is the best recipe and I am from the South so I know my red velvet cake! :-)

This recipe was featured in a Valentine's Day e-mail -- what a mistake! Even after correcting butter amount and adding melted chocolate, these were blah blah blah. Look elsewhere for chocolate cake including "Devil Dog Cake"

Dry cupcake. I'll stick to my red velvet cake recipe I've used for 40 years. My sister raves about Magnolia Bakery....but she admits the charm is that they have a cute name and sell cupcakes...not that they taste great.

Rating: 0
The reason for the negative reviews is because the recipe should actually have 1 1/2 cups of butter not 1 1/2 sticks of butter. If you watch the corresponding video she used 1 1/2 cups butter. I didn't realize till after my first batch, but I did notice that my butter sugar mixture was not getting fluffy so I added an additional 1/2 stick of butter and had already reduced the sugar by a 1/4 cup. Hope this is helpful.

These were terribly boring. I sincerely hope this isnt the real Magnolia's recipe. Hmmm maybe I should open a bakery.

Very average cupcake, not much flavor, and a bit on the dry side. I don't like to use red food coloring in these amounts as it's artificial and may even be an allergen. There are recipes for Red Velvet Cake and Cupcakes that use beets - and they aren't bad. Why not just use Dutch- Processed cocoa and get a reddish tint naturally?

The ingredient ratios are off! I increased the amount of butter to 1-1/2 cups (3 sticks) and the cake turned out great! The Creamy Vanilla Frosting needed 1/4 teaspoon of salt, which I added to the flour/milk mixture. Made a 15" heart shaped single layer cake (from a 10" square & a 10" round, baked 30-35 min.). It received rave reviews from ~30 at a Feb baby shower. The mother- to-be specifically requested red velvet cake; she and the baby each had a piece.

I made these for someone who loves Magnolia, which I have never understood--their cakes are bland and dryish and tend to be rather leaden, and this was no exception. I was a professional pastry chef for many years and I just don't get it. My theory is that Magnolia's stuff just tastes like the thrown- together, heavy, sugary treats that relatives made for kids' birthday parties in the 1960's and 70's and that the nostalgia is what people enjoy. The baked goods are deeply mediocre.

My husband and i loved these. I made them as cupcakes.

The cake was moist but like the last reviewer stated, not very flavorful. Merely a vehicle for consuming the vanilla icing, which was delicious.

I didn't think the cake was very flavorful, i have much better cake recipes that i would make over this one. Very disappointed.
