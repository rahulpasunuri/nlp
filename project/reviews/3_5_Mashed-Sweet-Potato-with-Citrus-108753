I used two sweet potatoes, and coconut oil in place of butter. I also added a little cinnamon as another reviewer suggested. Very tasty but a little flat. I'll definitely make it again, but I may skip the nutmeg and add a little jalapeno, cilantro and lime next time.

I didn't like the taste of orange on this recipe. Next time, I will stick to the traditional sweet potato.

Made this along with the Turkey Cutlets with Brussel Sprouts and Cranberries and a Brown Bag Apple Raspberry Pie - easy, good, and not ridden with guilt over added calories.

My husband, who thought he hated sweet potatoes,loves this recipe so much that he wants to have it at least once a week. Very low cal--no need for the butter.

This was surprisingly good for how simple it was, not overly sweet or heavy - I might even consider making this for Thanksgiving! The only change I made was to add a dash of cinnamon.

So easy and good! I loved it and my one year old daughter did too. I doubled the recipe and it was the right amount for a family of three, with just a little bit of leftovers. I did less than half of the orange peel, and all the OJ, and it was perfect.

LOVED this recipe. To save a lot of time, I microwaved the sweet potatoes for 6 minutes . I used a food mill so I didn't need to peel. I was a little worried about too much orange flavor, so I left out the orange zest and it turned out wonderful. Easy, healthy and delicious, will become a staple in my house.

for those who thought the orange was too prominent try adding a small amount of buttermilk or sourcream

Great recipe. To save time I chopped up the potatoes and boiled for 12 minutes. Came out great and was very fast.

Omigoodness! I made this to accompany a honey and lemon roasted chicken... DELICIOUS! Fragrant, creamy and delicately flavoured. A snap to put together.

I quadrupled the ingredients for a dinner party and used sweet potatoes and yams, 3 to 1. The melded flavors of the potatoes and the oranges are fabulous. This dish perfectly complemented our baked ham. Will definitely make it again.

I doubled the recipe and it turned out perfectly--people just loved it. The orange was delightfully present but not overwhelming. This dish is fragrant and quite velvety. This blend goes well with everything from pork chops to spicy lentil loaf. Pure comfort food--and here's a real compliment, I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for a Christmas dinner and it was received really well. Its a nice alternative to the really sweet sweet potatoes that one normally serves at a holiday meal.

I served this today and it wasn't a big hit. Everyone said it was ok, but not anything special and didn't particularly like the combination of the citrus taste with the sweet potato.

I like this so much I make it all the time. For the one who thought there was too much orange, taste as you add the juice and stop when you think it's enough. I've found that when I triple the recipe I have to go easy on the OJ

These are good with just the right citrus touch. We'll enjoy them again.

It was OK. I tripled everything in the recipe except didn't completely triple the zest, but the orange taste was still WAY too dominant. It was nearly all you could taste. I ended up adding brown sugar at the last minute, not thrilled with the outcome.

YUM! I was trying to find a recipe to recreate orange peel sweet potatoes from Whole Foods and this is better.
