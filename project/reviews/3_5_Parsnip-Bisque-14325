Loved this recipe! Made it as a first course which I brought to my in-laws for Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception -- I added a healthy dolop of sherry into the cookpot and stirred it right before I served it - it was WONDERFUL! Goes especially well with ham.

Tasty, comforting, but a bit one note- and it looks like booger baby food.

Very good recipe, although I left out the brown sugar (it was already very sweet). Also, it needed to be cooked down a bit after I pureed it, otherwise it would've been too thin. I left out the cream, because in my opinion the heavy cream just dampens the flavors, and in this case wouldn't add much in the way of smoothing the texture -- it was already smooth. Finally, it's a rather rustic and rich dish. I would make this as a soup course for a lighter meal, or for a meal in itself by garnishing with chestnuts and maybe some parmesan puff pastry and a side salad.

This was okay, but it is a very pasty-looking, rather ugly soup.

This is amazing, even with using half the cream and sugar.

Wonderful and different. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I took other reviewers' advice and reduced the cream, but still added the sugar and it was great. I ended up snipping some chives on top and making some homemade croutons for a little different texture.

Made this for the soup course at T'giving. We melted parmesan on a silpat to make little crisps that were the perfect garnish. We floated it on top and drizzled some really great olive oil on top. The cheese melted down as you ate it.

As creamed vegetable soups go, this was truly excellent. The taste of the parsnips really comes through. My vegetables took a long time to roast, so I'd recommend either increasing the heat and/or the cooking time. Halving the cream (I used 15% milk fat), as recommended by other reviewers, kept it silky without overwhelming it. In place of brown sugar I added 1 tsp each maple syrup and pear cognac. I also roasted a couple of cloves of garlic and garnished with chives.

Very good. I used 1 full onion as I like the taste of roasted onions and I believe they work well with the sweetness of the parsnips. I used half the cream and thought it was plenty.

wonderful! i loved the cream...but to each his own! this soup is much richer than it looks...it won't take much to fill you so beware if serving it as a first....i made the mistake of filling the bowls too full the first time i made this and my guests were stuffed before the main had arrived! it is very lovely and delicious....and easy! it works all on it's own if you want a quick dinner for two on a cold night....very cozy.

This was quick, easy and delicious. Forget the cream and thin the soup with extra stock if you need to. Be sparing with the sugar; the parsnips are naturally sweet.

Very good technique for root-based bisques. I found the extra 30 min of roasting unnecessary. I just threw all the vegetables together for 30 and then in the stock for 20. Great result, very full flavored and satisfying. Will make again.

Went over very well at Thanksgiving. Even my finicky family members asked for seconds. Made the following changes: used veggie boullion instead of chicken broth. Took the advice of another reviewer and prepared the veggies a day in advance. Used sour cream (about 1/3- 1/2 cup) instead of cream. Skipped the brown sugar (the parsnips are sweet enough by themselves).

I had the parsnips and only decided yesterday evening to make this bisque and unfortunately didn't have leeks or celery about. I substituted with carrots and shallots and otherwise followed the recipe precisely, though cut back the cream to about 1/4 cup. It's a terrific bisque, full of flavor and delicious. My kids loved it, too! A definite keeper, and I look forward to making it precisely according to the recipe next time (aside from the cream - 1/4 cup is more than enough).

This soup is really good, second only to the "Szechwan Carrot Soup" on this site. Made exactly as is but without the sugar at the end. Great winter soup!

Another thumbs up for this incredibly sophisticated soup. Great depth of flavor. Used a tad more parsnip than called for. It did not seem to need the brown sugar but I added just a teaspoon -- the roasted vegetables are naturally sweet. Garnished with snipped chives. Agreed with all the other cooks -- this is a keeper!

Add my praise to the list. I made it exactly as written. I was worried it would be a little under-seasoned (I normally dose things liberally with herbs), but in the end it was just delicious as-is. (I still might add a little fresh rosemary next time I make it, and a garnish of minced parsley for color).

I would give 3.5 forks. I was actually expecting this dish to have just a bit more of the rich flavor of parsnips that I love so well. Perhaps I roasted too long? I did use miso in lieu of chicken broth and it worked wonderfully. My fiance absolutely loved it!

Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Good texture, full of flavor. Just the thing for a cold winter's night!

Spectacular addition to a traditional Christmas dinner. All guests went home with the recipe. A must to try!

For anyone who loves parnsips, as I do, this soup is a great way to enjoy their flavor. The flavoring is subtle enough, however, that even those who think they don't like parsnips will enjoy this soup.

I've made this bisque at least a half a dozen times, but recently with vegtable stock rather than chicken stock, which seems to give it a more intense vegetable flavour. It's close to the top of my list for wonderful first course soups, and I have a very long list.

This soup had a delicious flavor. The only problem was mine turned out not quite thick enough. Next time I will increase the amount of parsnips and decrease the amount of chicken broth.

This was delicious! Obviously, it's only as good as the freshness of your parsnips. Mine were VERY fresh and sweet, so I didn't add the sugar at the end. Also, I only added 2 Tablespoons heavy cream at the end because I didn't want the cream to drown out the parsnip taste. The soup required no salt at all, and I dressed it with a few drops of cumin oil at the end (1 T ground cumin soaked in 2 T canola oil for a few hours. Use only the oil portion). This is simplicity itself to prepare and we'll be making it often.

I've served this soup at four separate dinner parties, and never told the guests what it was before they tasted it so that there would not be any preconceived notions. Everyone raved, with the best description being that it tasted like "restaurant soup". Once you tell people what it is made with, they are amazed at the simple ingredients, which create an incredibly rich taste. It is also a perfect match with so many different foods because the flavor does not overpower the rest of the meal.

This bisque is wonderful. Using less cream works well and I recommend a bit of colorful garnish such as chives or Italian parsley.

This is a country root vegetable soup with a lot of class. The presentation of this bisque with the meal your guests are anticipating enhances the entire epicurean process. I would serve this over and over again. No changes,its beautiful.

This soup was superb and very elegant; great for a nice dinner party. I did not even have to use the entire amt. of cream suggested, used only 1/3 and it was still great. The brown sugar makes it!
