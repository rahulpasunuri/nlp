I have made this recipe at least three times and liked it every time. BUT why not use fresh tarragon, 2tbs, as I have? Great flavor and quick cooking.

Easy, tasty dish. No complaints, is exactly what you would think. Will make it many more times.

This dish was very flavorful and well-balanced. We made it exactly as the recipe calls for, with the exception of seasoning the veal chops and refrigerating them about four hours prior to cooking. Will definitely make this again and will again pre-season the chops with the S&P and Tarragon as well...MMmmmmmm.

This recipe has possibilities but as written it has too much liquid in general . Also too much lemon for our taste.

Great recipe. The sauce was a bit too liquid but very appreciated at dinner party.

I made this recipe using a large veal shoulder blade chop, so I cooked it longer than the recipe said. Also added a splash of balsamic vinegar. I boiled the sauce down after the meat was done and it got to just the right consistency for pouring over the meat. The family loved it and the sauce was delicious with the delicate flavor of the veal. Will definitely make this one again.

This recipe was quick and easy, however I never got to the "syrupy" stage. The taste was fine, but I didn't care for the "soupy" consistency of the sauce. I made with pork loin chops and the flavors worked well.

YUM! This gets a 4 for ease & speed. I had some fresh rosemary so I used that instead. No problem to get to the syrupy stage -- I deglazed with the wine then added a little broth. I think I cooked it a little longer than prescribed. We had pasta but it would be great with mashed potatoes.

I used beef broth instead of chicken this time...much richer. Also, I deglazed the pan with about one quarter cup of the broth. Once it was all but evaporated, I added the wine and additional tarragon. Much closer to a "syrupy" consistency.

This is a short ingredient recipe and easy to make. Absolutely declicious. However, I have prepared this dish twice and have not been able to get to a syrupy stage. I've thickend it with a slurry made of flour and the liquid from the sauce. Worked well. I doubled the recipe for company and doubled the lemon juice, big mistake. Served this with couscous and vegetable medley. Was liked by all.

Excellent and simple. I've substituted pork loin chops and they work splendidly.

A delightful dish, flavorful, simple. Accompanied the dish with a Sangiovese red wine and vegetable medley.
