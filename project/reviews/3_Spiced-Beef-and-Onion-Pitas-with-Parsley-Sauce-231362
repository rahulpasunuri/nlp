I agree that it is overall lacking something. I add paprika to the rub and that helps a bit. I also add roasted red peppers. The pita totally falls apart and becomes a tasty mess so it isnt the best lunch to take to work. I do not agree about the sauce. I LOVE THE SAUCE! I love it with parsley and cilantro. I also love it with the mint that someone suggested. This does seem like a take on shwarma but I like it!

Added a small clove of garlic to the sauce and a handful of fresh mint leaves. Caramelized the onions and served it over coconut rice. Quite nice.

I think this recipe is a bit twisted, forget making the Parsley sauce, add parsley and hummus and you basically have a " Shawarma "

Definitely agree with others who felt this dish was missing something. A tangy tzatziki sauce would make it better.

The best part were the onions of course. Parsley sauce was okay. All the flavors went together well, but definitely missing something.

Not bad, but overall lacking something. The parsley sauce was ok, but not really worth breaking out the food processor for. The best part of the the recipe is the spice mixture on the beef. I will use that for fajitas or tacos. If I make this again, I'll add carrots, lettuce, or something else.

Even my parsley hating husband liked it! I may add bell peppers in when cooking the onions next time.

use cilantro, not parsley if you want an interesting kick

It was fantastic. The spice mixture was wonderful. Fresh spices are essential. I don't think that fresh pitas are essential, but you definately need to find a decent brand. The pitas I used were about a week old.

The spice mixture was interesting but not "spicy". Parsley sauce needed to be kicked up. Pita fell apart easily

Tasty, fast. The spices on the beef and the brightness of the parsley sauce elevated this from an otherwise average sounding dinner. We really enjoyed it; fresh pitas and fresh parsley are essential.

A fast and tasty recipe. Seemed overly simple but the spices on the beef and in particular the parsley sauce made it a little more special, a better than average supper. We really enjoyed this, very fresh pitas and very fresh parsley are essential.
