Thank you for the reviews, everyone! I wanted to taste the Earl Grey more too and so I tried some edits based on your feedback. In a food processor, I ground 2 tsp of tea from a tea bag that I snipped open. I used 2 teabags of early gray in a 1/2 of hot water and used that for 5 tbsp in the wet mixture but only 1 cup of buttermilk to balance the moisture. I thought the scones came out lovely and did have a hint of Earl Grey (I didn't have lavender but that would be delicious). I also drizzled on a glaze for the top with 1 tbsp meyer lemon juice, 1 tbsp cream cheese and 1 cup powdered sugar. It took it up a notch.

I put lavender colored sugar on top, they were very good!

The scones were fine in that they were light (not dough bombs, as scones can be) and fluffy BUT despite the fact I brewed extra strong tea and put in twice as much as called for, it could not be tasted at all! I even topped the scones with lavender sugar, which offered a tiny hit of the floral tones I was hoping for. Nice scone, nice texture, but true to scones the world wide - lacking in flavor. Perhaps using a professional aromapaste or essence oil of bergamot mixed with lavender flowers would help?

I'm always disappointed when scones don't offer more flavor. I know that they are traditionally flavorless, but they always let me down. These were flavorless as usual, but quite dashing. I used pretty much all of the 1/4 c of tea and a bit less buttermilk, but it still didn't make a difference-- The only way you would know tea went into them is if you were told. I baked them in 2.5in rounds for 17min at 425 and brushed and sugared them beforehand. Lovely little sides, def not the centerpiece of a tea party.

These scones were delicious. Ran out early and bought some Earl Grey with Lavender at Peets Coffee & Tea. Had a little trouble grinding the tea finely, because the lavender bits didn't want to grind up. The scones did taste of tea and lavender because I used a teaspoon to measure out the two heaps of the tea instead of a measuring teaspoon. I also let the tea steep for longer than three minutes. I liked the lighter texture of these scones.

The cream (for brushing) is actually brushed on to the scones and sprinkled with sugar BEFORE you bake them. This is very common in scone recipes. I added 2 tsp dried lavender to the recipe and it was delicious.

As far as scones go, these are perfectly acceptable. I confess I used regular Earl Grey, since I didn't want to make a special trip for the lavender variety, but I really can't detect *any* Earl Grey flavor in my finished product. In their favor, these scones came out delightfully light with just the right amount of sweetness. They were not as dense as I expect scones to be. Still, two forks, because they were indeed good, but by no means remarkable. These could probably be bumped up to the next level with a more intense dose of the tea?

Here are the missing directions: NOTE: The heavy cream should be brushed on when the scones are pulled from the oven and the sugar would then be sprinkled on the top. Allow the scones to cool and the cream and sugar will set in. The scones should be baked for 20-25 minutes.

This recipe is incomplete-- there are no baking instructions, nor are there instructions for the final two ingredients in the recipe. I had to make it up, and I must say it didn't go very well. Help!
