baking powder? No, no and no. An unacceptable recipe for Passover and not so special you'd run to make it the rest of the year

I think the problem is that they don't let the mixture sit for at least 30 min. before poaching. I use the recipe on the matzo meal box and add flavorings to enhace and they are always perfect.

If it doesn't work for Passover, it doesn't work for us! Schmaltz is nice, but where's the seltzer?

I've been searching for the perfect matzo ball and even decided to render my own chicken fat to try these bad boys, but I was let down. They were a bit chewy inside and had little flavour. I've eaten the balls at the Second Ave Deli and either I wasn't able to represent them properly or there's some smidgen of family secret missing from the recipe.

This recipe has been published many times. It cannot be used for passover because of the baking powder. The matzoh balls made from the mixes, Streits, Goodmans, Manischevitz, are consistently good and save much time and anxiety. I recommend them and I particularly like Goodmans, 50% less salt matzoh ball mix. With the mixes you always know what you are going to get. I also like to put a very little bit of cinnamon in the mix but of course you could add anything you wanted.

These are very fluffy, which is nice. But, they aren't as flavorful as I might have hoped. For a slightly firmer, but richer recipe, try this one: http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=108017. I might try boiling them in stock next time.
