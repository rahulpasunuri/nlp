This was my first attempt at tahini salad dressing, I added dried mint and paprika. Very little sea salt & some agave syrup for flavour. I sort of eyed everything but it turned out great, definitely worth doing again.

I liked this recipe but I'm looking for something a little thicker. I followed the recipe. It may have a better consistency if stirred by fork. I thought the garlic was too much and i love garlic. My husband liked the garlic. I think I will try the posted recipe from bon appetit from another review..

True tahini has minimum seasoning in it and this recipe is way over seasoned. Try to put a dash of salt, a bit of dried mint, juice from half a lemon mixed with the same quantity of cold water. DO NOT put garlic! Garlic ruins the true tahini taste and makes it extra perishable.

Keeping in mind previous "too salty" comments, I put in 1/2 the salt & just a pinch of sugar. I also did a little more lemon and water than called for in the ongoing "reduce calories" battle. This is my new fave dressing and it's even better the next day after the garlic has had its way.

used less salt. about a 1/4 tsp. was o.k. served w/ felafels, pitas, yogurt mint dressing, and other toppings. mixed leftover dressings together a couple of days later and had w/ toasted pita chips.

This was WAY salty. I suggest trying it completely without and titrating up if necessary. I also found it improved with the addition of about 1/3 cup of thick Greek yogurt. I am about to go out in my garden and pick a small handful of spearmint leaves to mince and stir in. I hope this mix will dress my grilled eggplant righteously.

This tasted terrific -- my husband said it's one of his all-time favorite dressings, and he's very picky. I took advice of previous poster and just stirred in a bowl -- there's really no reason to dirty up a mixer for this recipe.

this is very easy and delicious. will definitely make again and again. I love that it has no oil. We had it over a salad of cucumbers, tomatos, avocado and green onion. A keeper!

I'm a sesame lover big time, and the sesame flavor is strong here, BUT the quantity of lemon juice gave this dressing an objectionable bitterness. I added a teaspoon of sugar to compensate somewhat, but am in search of a better recipe. In my opinion, this one fell short.

I had never made tahini dressing before, and have only eaten it out a few times, but remembered that I really enjoyed it. I thought this recipe was really good. I served it as the dressing for a mixed green and vegetable salad with poached salmon and lemon mayonaise. It was very good. I will definitly make it again.

I much prefer the variation that I found in a Bon Appetit 1996 (I think)Spinach and Onion Salad recipe. I get and give a rave review to both the salad and the dressing. Here's that version of the dressing: Vinaigrette 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 3 tablespoons tahini (sesame seedpaste) 2 tablespoons coarse-grained mustard 1 teaspoon honey 1 small garlic clove, minced 3/4 vegetable oil

This is the traditional tahini recipe. The only thing I have found is that its much better making by hand (using a fork) instead of using a blinder. You get a better consistancy and you can adjust the seasoning to you taste.
