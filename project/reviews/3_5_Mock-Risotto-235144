I really liked this recipe. It's simple and quick. Love Asiago cheese, and it really does come out like a risotto. Not quite the same, but good as a side dish, and quick enough to made any weeknight.

This recipe lives up to its name -- it is a quick and easy recipe that tastes like the more labor-intensive versions of risotto. Easy and tasty. What more could you ask for?

This is an easy and time saving recipe for risotto and I could not tell the difference from the original tedious recipe. I increased the rice to 16 oz. and the cheese to 1 cup but before I put in the cheese added more chicken stock to cream the rice up a bit. This is very good with the Lamb Stew with Leeks and Baby Artichoke recipe located on this site.

I enjoyed this recipe. Nice way to make rice that's a little less pedestrian than plain rice, but not as much work as a regular risotto. I've made it several times; it's particularly tasty with fish.

Adequate but quick risotto recipe.
