A delicious, cooling and elegant dessert. It's lovely in early fall when grapes are in season. The one tip I would offer is in regards to the grape skin (others here have mentioned it can be distracting, and I agree). You can make sure there aren't any bits of grape skin in the final product by pushing the puree through a fine mesh strainer before adding it to the other ingredients. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

instead of using grapes, I used equal amounts of mango puree and mango nectar in place of grapes and grape juice, and omitted the cinnamon. the result was fantastic. at some point I intend to make it using grapes, but the mango variation was amazing and I highly recommend it.

The flavor is wonderful. The bits of skin are on the one hand interesting and on the other distracting. My grape pieces were not bitter but they didn't add anything positive. There are way too many grapes in this recipe. I had about a cup of pulp left over so I added a few more grapes, sieved out some pulp and made a second batch. I liked the second batch better with less skin. I think in the future, I would not blend as much and sieve the fruit so that more of the skin could be removed. The flavor still is a winner!

This was very good and fun to make. I will be bolder with my use of cinnamon next time and more exacting about skin removal. I thought a little skin would make it taste fresher, but it only left us with bitter bits of skin to awkwardly pick off our tongues. I made this using the zipper bag + rock salt method of ice cream-making and it turned out perfect.

This sorbet is excellent! The cinnamon really adds a nice touch to the grape flavor. However, the next time I make this sorbet, I will make sure my grape puree is very fine (I had one complaint about the grape skin).
