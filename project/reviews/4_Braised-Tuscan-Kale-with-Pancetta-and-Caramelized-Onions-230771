I have made greens for most of my life, growing up around cooks in the kitchen with various techniques. This recipe holds its own against that of my grandmothers. Wonderful and consistant. 4 Thumbs up!

I have made this recipe several times and every time it is a hit. I have even substitued bacon for pancetta and it was just as good. It is however quite time consuming to make and not exactly healthy but very tasty!

A little salty, but everyone loved it! My husband, who's never eaten kale before, thought it was great! About to make it again for the second time :)

I made this as a side for Thanksgiving last year and everyone wanted the recipe and asked that I make it again-- it was fantastic! The combination of greens and salty pancetta work as a perfect compliment to any meat dish.

best cooked kale i've eaten! I made this while cleaning out my fridge, so I had to use bacon instead of pancetta, shallots instead of onions, dried herbs and fresh parsley. I didn't braise it nearly as long as stated. Oh man this was delicious!

Delicious! Perfect for a snow day. I smashed and peeled whole garlic cloves rather than putting the head in. That gave me the option of keeping the garlic in, which in the end, I did. I didn't use any additional fat beyond what rendered from the bacon. So good!

I made this for the first time last night - delicious! I served it in a small mound on a bed of flattened brown rice with a poached egg on top for a very satisfying vegetarian supper. I added some slow roasted tomatoes as a garnish.

Though it was a lot of prep work, the dish was delicious. I made it as written except for using 4 T. butter instead of 6, and also chopped 4 garlic cloves and added them to the onions instead of slicing a whole head in half and removing at the end. Note, if it isn't apparent from the ingredient list, this dish is RICH! Though I served it with braised chicken thighs, I imagine it would be delicious over some hearty whole grain like barley, farro, or brown rice.

First of all, kale, especially the lacinato/dinosaur/tuscan variety, is delicious. It has more flavor and texture than smily ol' cooked spinach. This recipe is wonderful. Just to clarify some nutritional misinformation below, vitamin C is NOT fat soluble (the only fat-sol vitamins are A, D, E and K), and despite the reviewer's best efforts to be healthy, fat actually improves the absorption of the fat-solutble vitamins and phytochemicals found in kale (and most other vegetables). It also makes it taste so much better! Go for it, use some fat, your body and your taste buds will thank you. And, please, leave the nutrition advice to Registered Dietitians.

wow. This was an absolutely delicious dish. I made a few alterations but mostly kept it the same. I couldnt make it to the store that can actually slices pancetta for you, and had to deal with the thin, pre-packaged slices, which i fried and then crumbled before putting back in the saute pan. i didnt put in fresh thyme, but had some dried that i sprinkled in. I also omitted the bay leaf. for the garlic, i saw the other review and so i peeled the garlic before putting the cloves in (and then i left the garlic in after, because i love garlic!) probably one of the tastiest side dishes i've ever had - i served the dish with chicken, and it was great!

I added halved kalamata olives and a quick squeeze of sun-dried tomato paste near the end of the cooking time and it was sublime.

I wanted to write a review on this before I even got a chance to taste it, but realized that wouldn't be fair. Here's why: Fait, just like kale, is also not to be feared. Kale is PACKED with vitamins A, C and K, all of which are fat soluble. So, by all means, make this without the use of fats, and go ahead and try to benefit from the nutritional values of kale while you're at it.. However, after tasting the finished dish, I found the taste a little muddled. The only alteration I made was bacon for pancetta. I would recommend omitting the olive oil and reducing the amount of butter by half. It was very tasty, however. I would make this again and play around with the recipe. Let me know if anyone tries it that way and if you found this post helpful.

delicious! I never have parchment paper and thought it would be more efficient to do this without running the oven, so I put the blanched kale in my slow cooker, brought all of the other ingredients up to a simmer (following the recipe) then added it to the cooker and cooked on low heat for about 2 1/2 hrs. At that point it was delicious but I kept it cooking with the lid off for about another hr to evaporate some of the liquid. The only other change I made was reducing the amount of pancetta by about a third and cutting the butter in half. Took it to a birthday party and folks loved it.

This recipe was great, even though we didn't make it as written. Didn't add extra butter, oil, or pork fat. Let the kale braise in pre-cooked bacon and chicken stock on the stove top on low heat for about 45 minutes. Didn't put it in the oven, and it still tasted perfect with our beer brined pork chops and apple sauce.

I made this the first time without the panchetta or bacon. I just used a little olive oil to brown the onions in and added about 4-5 cloves chopped garlic at the end of browning. I then added a can of organic fire-roasted diced tomatoes and less chicken broth and braised it in the oven. With about 15 minutes of braising time left I added 2 Wahoo fish steaks to the Covolo Nero and continued braising. I then kept the fish warm and reduced it on the stove for about 20 minutes, at this point I then added a drained can of great northern white beans to the kale mixture along with salt and fresh pepper and served the fish on top of this. It was delicious!!! Tonite I'm making it as a healthy side dish (without the panchetta or extra oil).

We wanted to find a rustic Tuscan side dish to accompany our braised beef cheeks. This was exceptional! Forget everything you ever knew about kale, and how it tastes. While this was nearly a 3 hour (considering store bought stock) endeavor (lots of time in between phases to get other things done in the kitchen) it was well worth it. The taste was complex, even sweet. The biggest challenge for me was dealing with garlic bulb (which they don't have you peel), and the skins that I had to dig out of the kale. At the end, they have you discard the garlic and the bouquet garni, but I found myself sifting through looking for skins during the cooking process. It was a huge hit, however! Would definitely make again.

Low (lower) calorie recipe: I used 3 strips of Niman Ranch bacon instead of the pancetta and no extra oil. Very tasty this way too!

I made a soup based on this recipe. Terrific. Do not fear kale! It's delicious and healthy.

Unbelievably delicious. I have only tried this recipe using regular kale. It also works well using smoked ham instead of the pancetta.

Hey, this is good! Yes, cavolo nero is also good prepared in a simpler manner, as the first rater suggests, but, I was looking for a something new. As the paragraph at the top suggests, this would be good with game or risotto, something rich.

I made this dish for a party I catered. It was a GREAT success! Will be making over and over again.
