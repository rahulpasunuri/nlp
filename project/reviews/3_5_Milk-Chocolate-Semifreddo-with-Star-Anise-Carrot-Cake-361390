I was sorely disappointed with this recipe. Each part was made exactly as written, not a single minute change. The semi-freddo was grainy and rather bland. The cake was tasty with rather sophisticated flavors tantalizing the tongue. The carrot "soup" which should have brought all together was mediocre. How could Charlie Trotter be so off his genius? After discarding the milk chocolate semi-freddo I made an orange semi-freddo hoping it would redeem the dessert. In the end, for the effort involved, I say nix.

This is a fantastic, simple, wholesome recipe.I made it with a gorgeous bunch of carrots from our CSA share. Each component can stand on its own, but the presentation with carrot puree and semifreddo is fantastic.I will certainly make the cake-part regularly. I did use dark rather than milk chocolate. If I did the full recipe again I'd make the carrot juice myself to really highlight the fresh sweetness of the carrots.

This was the first time I'd ever made a Charlie Trotter recipe, and it was very successful. I didn't have pure carrot juice, so I used carrot/orange which went well. There are many elements, but each is fast and easy to make. Though the milk chocolate semifreddo is sweet, it goes very well with the cake -- suprisingly. It was a hit at my dinner party!
