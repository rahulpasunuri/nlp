Elegant, unusual recipe. I served it as part of my holiday buffet, but didn't return the mussels to their shell as described. I served them in a large bowl with the chervil oil drizzled over them. The shells take up too much room both in storage and on the table and do not really add anything beyond aesthetics. Too much needless work returning them to their shells, too. The mussels (my way!) were well-received and praised by many. Lots of copies of this recipe were passed out and emailed the next day.

I'M A CHEF IN N.Y.C. AND MADE THIS RECIPE FOR A RECENT DINNER PARTY.VERY TASTY!MY GUESTS LOVED IT THE PLATTER EMPTIED VERY FAST.I SUGGEST YOU SAVE SOME IN THE KITCHEN FOR YOURSELF.ALSO TRY REPLACING CHERVIL OIL WITH CHIVE OIL. IT MAKES FOR A VERY GOOD COMBINATION.
