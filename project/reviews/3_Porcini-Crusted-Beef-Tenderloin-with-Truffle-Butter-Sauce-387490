I am a big fan of both porcini mushrooms and black truffles and made this recipe for a Sunday dinner. It is pretty simple to make - not too many steps. I didn't have truffle butter or oil, but I did have a little jar of truffle tapenade, made with minced mushrooms, olive oil and truffle oil, so I used that instead and it worked well, imparting that delicious truffle flavor! I served with roasted root vegetables - small onions and potatoes, and also some steamed romanesco. It was a delicious meal. I ended up with quite a bit of the sauce leftover though. I'm going to try freezing it, but not sure if that will work out...
