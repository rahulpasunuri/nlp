The trick to this recipe is that you make it a day or two ahead of time. Once the chile and lime have saturated the mix, it is DELICIOUS. I, too, was underwhelmed at first, but marination is the key!

I was'nt thrilled by this either. I took the general Idea and tweaked it into a Jicama rst'd red pepper salad w/ citrus vinaigrette. I serve it to students at Skidmore college in Saratoga Springs NY and they love it. I also post a wikipedia information sheet after being aske what "Gee-ka-mah" was a 10000 times.

Salad was okay, but not good enough to be worth the preparation. I wouldn't make it again.

I must have missed something -- I made the recipe exactly as printed, and neither me nor my guests were impressed. It looked nice, but was bland and unexciting.

This was great. I added 1/2 tsp sugar to the dressing as it was pretty tart. Also put slices of avocado around with the oranges, and served it on a bed of lettuce.

a very easy dish to prepare, and everyone seems to love it. i use a little less salt, add a bit of fresh cilantro, and once the ingredients are assembled, sprinkle a dash more cayenne on top for extra zing and color.

Tastes good, filling, easy to make & it looks great too!

I served this with a spicy chicken dish and people loved it. Very surprising and substantial, like the other reviewer, my guests cleaned their bowls.

This recipe provides an excellent contrast of flavors, textures, and colors, and is very easy to assemble. Our guests scooped every last bit of the dressing out of their bowls!
