This was a waste of good ingredients. The flavor was flat, not even much tomato flavor. If you are looking for a chilled soup, try something else, perhaps something that starts with sauted onions and chicken stock.

I did not like this recipe much at all, and I thought I would since I make a chilled beet and yogurt soup that I love. I felt this tasted too acidic and didn't work well as a chilled soup. I ended up the next day adding a can of pureed tomatoes to it and heating it on the stove as a hot soup with a bit more tomato to yogurt ratio. It was better this way, but definitely not something to make again.

Very tasty. A perfect soup for a hot summer's day.

Delicious. I used half fresh tomatoes and half canned diced tomatoes; I used low-fat yogurt, and found the soup was thin-tasting, so I added 1/2 cup sour cream, and that did the trick. I also added 1/2 tsp sugar, and that took the edge off the acid. I also used about half the basil the recipe called for, since that was all I had. I'm not sure I would have wanted much more, even if I had it.

Extremely nutritious, easy, cheap, and tasty- always a good combination of factors.
