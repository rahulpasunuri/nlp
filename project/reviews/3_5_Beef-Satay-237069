This was a delicious summer dinner! I also added 2 T. of coconut aminos (soy sauce) and a dash of olive oil. It was a quick preparation with tamarind paste I had on hand and 1 t. of powdered turmeric instead of fresh. We served it with rice, a curry almond sauce, zucchini and fresh peaches. Divine!

lovely aroma and very tender beef. Will certainly make it again!

The theory of making the satay works well, but the marinade just didn't taste good. The only substitution I made was to use dry turmeric (newly bought so as fresh as possible). The taste was blah, we won't be making this again.

Nice nice flavor. Using jarred tamarind concentrate worked very well. One suggestion: stroke most of the marinade off the slices of beef as you skewer them. I left too much on, and the meat was too wet to get any grill charring. But tasty!
