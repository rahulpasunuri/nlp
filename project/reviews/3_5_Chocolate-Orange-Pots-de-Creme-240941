I was a little dissapointed with this recipe. It was tasty, but an extremely thick texture that was just sooo heavy with the dark chocolate. I had some blood orange curd in the fridge for a different dessert (also on epi) and I put some of that on top along with the whipped cream. This made it decent because the orange and cream helped cut the flavor. Maybe if you're an insane chocolate lover this would be good, but I prefer something more like a ganache that's at least had some air whipped into it. Plan on mixing with other flavors/fruit or else you might be a bit overwhelmed.

I made this for a dinner party, and it was received to rave reviews. It came out rich and creamy (even without straining - I don't have a sieve!) and delicious. I'd never made any custard-like thing in a water bath before, so it was a little tricky for me, but altogether quite manageable, and definitely worth it. I will definitely make these again!

This is a knock out and so simple! I used Bernard Callebaut orange leaf and also added orange zest to the cream mixture during heating to add extra orange intensity and removed it during the sieve process. This is now on my great desserts with little effort list!

I added 1 tbsp of Triple Sec and grated zest of an orange. It was very tasty, rich and creamy.

I have only very basic baking skills and this recipe was so simple and the result is a decadent, seemingly-professional dessert. I skipped the straining step (I didn't have a sieve) and it was fine. I also couldn't find orange bittersweet chocolate so I got regular bittersweet chocolate bars and added 1-2 tablespoons orange extract while melting.

Really easy which is a plus. but was a little disappointing. Followed recipe as written but just didn't have the flavor/smooth rich texture I was looking for. There are better recipes and better tasting chocolate to be used. Will not make again. Sorry - didn't hate it just didn't love it.

This was a very easy and quick to prepare and the taste was great. The orange flavour was not as heavy as you would think and the cinnamon gave it a bit of compexity.
