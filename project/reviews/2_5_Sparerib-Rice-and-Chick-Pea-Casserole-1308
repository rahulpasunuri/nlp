I think spareribs are too fatty for this dish. Chicken would be a better meat, or a leaner pork. I also wasn't thrilled with the flavor of this dish. The rice needed something 'more' either spiciness or maybe even a little tartness.

I would make this dish again, but it needs some work. Or, it could be the cook. The meat was overcooked. I think that browning with 50 minutes of cooking is too much, or at least it was for me. I will have to play with this. Salt and pepper to taste would be a good addition, but then, I like fresh ground pepper in most everything except Key Lime Pie.

I tend to like dishes with complex flavors, this was not one. While the meat was tender this dish does not present itself well. This is more of a comfort dish, not something you would prepare for company.

Easy to make. The vinegar gave it a really good flavor. Will definitely make it again.
