Excellent! Based on reviews, I did add cucumber, which added a nice crunch. My meat and potatoes husband was even very complementary (he was nervous about "just a salad" for dinner). I am looking forward to making this for guests.

Great variation of classic spinach salads. We used mostly leftover dark meat turkey with a Point Reyes blue cheese that crumbled well and had a good tangy taste. The dressing is wonderful.

This is incredibly fast, easy and delicious! Any nut would be good. The combination of blue cheese, nut and dressing is excellent. I also added a little chopped cucumber for crunch.

This was a nice surprise. I took one reviewer's advice and also added toasted pecans (instead of the pine nuts) and added dried cranberries. It was a good use of leftover turkey.

Great and aggressive combination of ingredients. I agree with "Jeff from Chicago" that this is not for timid palates, save it for adventurous types! I also cut the oil in half, and served it as a salad as well as a main course with pasta. (Added ingredients to hot pasta, saving spinach and cheese until last so they were just wilted/partially melted respectively). Excellent both ways. It could also be kicked up a little with approx. 1 tsp. chile/garlic sauce.

Outstanding! What a great Saturday-After-Thanksgiving lunch treat. We prepared the recipe exactly as written except for the addition of a little hard-boiled egg that needed using. The dressing was a especial hit. This goes into my recipe box.

My guests are still (a year later) talking about the salad I made using this dressing. I combined baby greens, toasted pecans, dried Cranberries, and crumbled Stilton and dressed it with the Worcestershire-Chutney Vinaigrette. The flavors were perfect together. It does make a LOT of dressing, though.

An extraordinary entree salad that we will be delighted to feed to guests! We made this with leftover "London-broil Turkey breast" (i.e., grilled boneless turkey breast) that we then sliced 1/2" thick and re-grilled briefly, cut into squares and added to the salad. Hint: Add only enough dressing to coat salad, otherwise there is too much! Use nothing other than the Stilton cheese recommended. We will try this salad with smoked turkey but we do not feel it is necessary. Enjoy! We did!!!

My family and I found this recipe too sweet. I will not make it again. I believe that the chutney was the cause of the sweetness.

Amazing salad. I used leftover turkey I had hickory-roasted whole on the Weber. I wasn't particularly impressed when I came across this recipe on the site, but I happened to have lots of fresh spinach and pine nuts on hand (as well as copious amounts of the aforementioned turkey), so I gave it a whirl. Glad I did. There are lots of strong flavors at work here--it may not be the best salad for kids or timid palates--but they all play off one another wonderfully. The smokiness of the turkey is a natural complement to the faint fruitiness of the Stilton (try not to substitute!). The pine nuts provide a crunchy counterpoint to the otherwise soft ingredients, and play up the nutty notes in the Stilton. The chutney dressing is intensely flavored, but does not overpower the other ingredients, which are themselves strong flavors. It's clear that this salad was created by someone with a well-developed sense of taste combinations. I paired the salad with bread and a South American malbec that was fruit-forward yet had enough backbone to stand up to these bold and wonderful flavors. The hint of smokiness typical of malbec wines from South America made it a perfect marriage with the hickory-infused turkey. I could go on and on, but but you need to start cooking!

Stop looking!!! You will never need another recipe on how to serve leftover turkey or even chicken. This is a truly wonderful recipe and very easy to put together. I did not have Stilton cheese on hand so I used an aged white chedder. I also was fortunate enough to have fresh salad spinach growing on our deck. The toasted pine nuts add a wonderful addition to this dish.

I this probably a dozen times. it's my husbands favorite. For someone who doesn't have dressing on his salad I find that preety interesting.

I cut the oil by half since it IS peanut oil! I couldn't see what difference (in taste) that could have been gained by adding more. Even the kids liked it - but not the Stilton. Maybe cubes of a more mild cheese (butterkase?) might suffice. This is a great use for leftover turkey, and light enough for the day after the big feast!
