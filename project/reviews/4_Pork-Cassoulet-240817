Made this dinner party favorite but used duck bacon. The flavor was amazing and gave a bit of autenticity and richness to the dish. Plan to make it again for our Holiday Book Club meeting in December with lots of red wine and French bread.

I forgot to say, actually I did use 1/3 of the bacon.

It's amazing fun to make, with a good high right around #6! Typical, beautiful French meal - looks digusting, tastes incredible. You need to trust that there is not too much liquid when you put it in the oven, just follow the instructions. Wouldn't change a thing - though I did use veg. broth. You can easily make your breadcrumbs in the early stages.

Its not really fair to rate this recipe because I changed it to much, and I wouldn't call it cassoulet. I used pancetta and italian sausage though 1/2 the amount that it calls for with the bacon. I also used pork stewing meat altho I did add a couple of pork knuckles for the richness. I used flageolet beans, more garlic, and I added leeks and rapini in the last hour of cooking. I made sure my bread crumbs formed some browned crust. It was very good, though not sure what I would call it, its definitely not cassoulet

The first time I make a recipe I make it to the exact measurements. This way you get the feel of what the chef wanted to convey. This was very good and I do not see the need to make any changes. I would make again.

A note to the so called "foodie" before me who chose not to try this recipe, yet felt superior enough to rate it and berate it. You really missed out. It is a great recipe. To those of you finding it too soupy, make sure the cover is OFF for the last hour. I added extra panko

Given that people had to make a lot of modifications, and that it seems to have turned into a stew i.e. lacking a good crust, this looks like typical "bad foodie" recipe writing. (As opposed to good foodies.) Which is too bad because the flavors look interesting. Unfortunately, I've been burnt by other bad recipes on site, so am in no mood to extend myself out there and make a dish that sounds good and turns out a flop...

Absolutely Delicious!!!!!!!! Pretty much stuck to the recipe - except I always increase the amount of garlic. A winner!

We really enjoyed this hearty dish and it is so good left over. Nice change from potatoes, rice and pasta. As per other reviewers, 1/3 lb of bacon seemed to work just right.

Made this for dinner on a chilly Saturday afternoon and it really warmed us up. After reading these reviews, I too cut the bacon to about 1/2 pound. I used panko breadcrumbs and it really thickened it up.

Delicious! Pork was very tender. I followed the recipe as written except I did take about 3 cups of liquid off before I put the whole dish back into the oven. If I hadn't done this it would have taken a long time to cook off all the liquid. I made bread crumbs for a french loaf. This is a don't skip step! The bread crumbs add some substance to the broth. Yummy!

The photo does this incredible dish no favor. It was fantastic. I roughly doubled it, using trimmed pork shoulder, less bacon (five thick slices for the doubled recipe), fresh tomoatoes, and a bit less than double the liquid. Dried thyme works well. My dinner party guests all had seconds! Easy and delicious.

Easy and really good. I thought it was a little too soupy, but I kept it overnight in the fridge before heating and serving for dinner and it came out perfect. The beans soaked up enough of the liquid to make a great consistency.

I liked this a lot. A couple of changes: I didn't have canned beans, so I used a half a bag of dried and did the boil/soak method while the ribs were cooking. I used only three strips of bacon (really? a whole lb?) and baby back ribs. Came out great, tasty, lots of leftovers.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful! I used half the bacon and added Italian sweet sausage. I made this for New Year's Day and everyone just loved it! I don't think it needs duck confit and all that other authentic stuff. This is superb as is. I will make this many times for special occasions and cold wintery days.

I loved this meal. I've made it twice. Once with pork shoulder the othe with pork butt. Both were excellent, but very different from each other. I'll make this over and over.

The only thing I will change next time is cut the bacon in half. And that is because it is a rich dish.

really good. i did it with a grilled Toulouse sausage instead of the pork shoulder (because that's what I had) and it was great. just cooked the sausage separately and threw it in at the very end (whole).

My family loved it on this cold night. I will use less broth next time, but otherwise it was perfect. I used half smoked sausage/half bacon and we enjoyed that. Definitely will make again and share the recipe with others.

O.M.G. This was fantastic!! Like other reviewers, I used low sodium everything, 12oz of thick sliced smoked bacon, boneless country style spare ribs (PER-FECT!), and followed the recipe exactly. Well, I used a TAD less chicken broth just to make sure it didn't turn out too soupy. It was perfect. Used panko bread crumbs and only pressed/stirred them in twice during the final hour of cooking. Pefect flavors, perfect thickness. Nice country-style french bread along with, to sop up the goodness. Can't WAIT to do leftovers tomorrow!! More for the freezer too. Did 5 servings, could easily be 6.

Simply delicious with our meat CSA's country style ribs. Recipe is very forgiving with respect to bean/tomato proportions (like if you thought you had two cans of beans but only had one, and you had a 28 oz can of tomato but not a smaller one).

I used Pork chunks (masa de puerco) browned them throughly added all the remaining ingredients and set it to boil for a while. I omitted the salt as advise by other reviewers and used 1/2 pack of bacon. At this point the pork seemed tasteless. I let everything cool and broke up the pork chunks. Popped it in the oven for that last hour and boy oh boy it was WONDERFUL - not only was I relieved but wow!!! What a lovely flavor. It was stew like - not soupy. My pinicky husband even said to add it to our recipe box. Woo Hoo & Thank you!!

This was excellent. And easy to make--especially for cassoulet. We doubled the recipe, froze the leftovers, and it is still a treat whenever we have it again.

I love traditional cassoulet but rarely make it because it's so much work. This is an exceptional recipe, really flavorful faux-cassoulet that takes very little work for the quality of the dish. I follow others' suggestions to make it less rich and less salty (sirloin chops instead of ribs, 1/2 the amount of bacon, low/no-salt components). I also cut back on the liquid and increased the amount of bread crumb mixture to make it a bit thicker. Sometimes I toss in a turkey kielbasa or whatever smoked meat or ham I happen to have on hand. Turns out great! I have made this multiple times, served to company, always a hit.

Oh, how I love this recipe! But I only gave it three forks because mine looks nothing like the picture or the description, even though I followed the recipe to the T. We added the breadcrumbs and they didn't sit on top like a crust, because it was like a soup! However, they did serve to thicken the soup. The best pork and bean soup I've ever had! Just don't call it cassoulet. ;-) We'll make it again and again.

Made this last night and we loved it! It's a great weeknight dinner but would definitely be good enough for company. I made a couple of changes: didn't use country-style spareribs because they're just waaaaay too rich and fatty but I had some boneless pork sirloin chops in the freezer and they worked very well. Thanks to earlier reviews, I didn't add any salt at all and it was perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious!

This is much better the next day or later. I pulled some out of my freezer a while back and it was amazing. This is the second time I've made it and I think I will cut back on the liquid next time. I used kielbasa instead of bacon.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe to the letter, saving the last hour of cooking, and let the pot sit in the fridge for two days before finishing it off. My two emphatic comments are: WOW, is this ever rich; one might consider cutting back on the bacon. And WOW are country style ribs ever a scrappy cut of meat. Or perhaps I got a lousy break, I'm not very familiar with this cut. They added a lovely flavor, but between the bones and the sinew, I ended up picking them out before serving, removing the meat, and putting that back into the stew. I may try a different cut or a different recipe altogether next time.

I thought this recipe was eh, but then again, I'm no expert in the kitchen so it could be my own fault. I just thought it ended up being a lot of work for an end result that wasn't very exciting. My boyfriend gave it 4 out of 5 - he thought it was good. I was a bit disappointed, though.

Made this for guests last night. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. Perfect to make the night before except for the last hour of cooking. I agree with other reviewers that using low sodium stock, no salt added tomatoes and cutting back just a bit on the bacon keeps the dish from becoming overly salty. Will definitely make this again and again.

Of course, this is not your traditional cassoulet, but when you consider that it's made in 3 hours instead of 3 days, it's pretty spectacular. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender. We just used spoons; no one needed a fork. I adore thyme, so I added even a bit more than was called for, but I think most people will find the recipe amount sufficient. I also used up the entire carrot, instead of just 1/2, and I liked the added color. Other than that, followed as written. A very simple way to get a truly delicious meal.

I was looking for a dinner to make without having to go to the store. Had some pork in the freezer and thought maybe soup would be good. Came across this recipe (you know how broadly epicurious seaches) and decided to give it a try. Am I glad I did! Quite yummy! I'm happy to have the leftovers. Made it as written with a little less bacon. Can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.

I made this recipe on the spur of the moment last weekend. Outstanding! Followed the recipe exactly, except substituted dry thyme for the fresh. Will definitely make again

We really enjoyed this. Definitely do not add salt until you've tasted the finished product. I used packaged reduced-salt broth and no-salt-added tomatoes, and only 1/2 lb bacon. Any saltier and it would have been too much. Next time I will use homemade, unsalted broth.

This was good, but didn't live up to the other reviews, IMO. Maybe I used too many beans - I cooked some dried ones instead of using canned. We ended up calling this "French pork and beans" and everyone got sick of it before it was all gone. Shoulda frozen half of it like a previous reviewer said. I'd probably try it again, adding some kind of yummy sausage and maybe tripling the amount of garlic. Other than the dried beans, I followed the recipe to the letter.

This is an excellent dish and very comforting on a cold evening. I followed the recipe as written with one exception. Like the other reviewer, I used only 12 oz of bacon rather than 16 oz as called for (12 oz is plenty and the dish didn't suffer for less). My only comment is that the recipe calls for kosher salt to taste. Additional salt, in my opinion, is unnecessary due to the salt content if using a packaged chicken broth and the salt in the bacon. Next time I would omit the kosher salt altogether. Otherwise, this is a wonderfully flavorful and delicious meal.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I would make this any time. I didn't add the breadcrumbs at the end so there was a lot of extra tomato sauce but I took it and "ate" it as a bowl of soup. Yummy.

I made this almost exactly as written (I left out the clove and only used 12 oz of bacon instead of 16 oz.)It was absolutely delicious. Very flavorful. A great dish to make during the cold months when you want some "comfort food" to cook on the stove and enjoy the wonderful aromas and heat up the house. It made a LOT !! It would easily serve 8. I froze half of it and just reheated some for tonights dinner and it came out beautifully. This recipe is definitely a keeper !!

An excellent version of a cassoulet. I used the pork shoulder which worked well, and added a pound of sausage which was a Boudin Blanc -- a French sausage. You might be able to find it at some butchers, but we made it ourselves, and it was a great compliment to this recipe!
