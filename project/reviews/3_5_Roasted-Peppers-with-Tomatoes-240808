Four forks because it is so easy and delicious too. I didn't have capers so I made it without. I added italian seasoning on top prior to putting in the oven.

I'm a big fan of the Silver Palate and after fixng this dish, I'm surprised I am the first comment. I found it a delicious way to use items on hand. My only change was to use PAM, rather than oil. Thank you Shelia for an easy tasteful dish!
