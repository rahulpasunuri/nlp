I make this once each fall and it is WELL worth the effort. I have tried other cassoulets, foreign and domestic, and nothing comes close. It also comes out slightly different each time depending on the amounts of bacon, lamb, sausage used. All are fabulous.

We loved this recipe. We did the recipe with two cooks over a weekend - sharing the work (along with the wine) which made it much easier. We followed the recipe very closely (especially skimming off the fat), but we'd suggest tweaking a couple of small things. Perhaps a little less bay, a little more thyme, and we might cook the beans a bit less next time ... thank goodness for a publicly funded health care system - we're worried about our cholesterol levels after this fabulous meal!

I have had my eye on this recipe for some time. I made the confit myself, and my 7 year old (after tasting it) said "can we have this for dinner every night?" Having never made cassoulet before nor having it, I followed the directions precisely. The aromas that filled my house for almost two days were, well... I think my 7 year old says it best again: "it's like heaven!". So final assembly and in the oven she goes, and we are all waiting with great anticipation, only to be sorely disappointed. The beans had not softened up completely, the duck that had been melt-in-your-mouth delicious was much less stellar in the end. The richly flavored sauce didn't hold up either. Even now, 4 hours after dinner, the dish is in the oven, barely simmering (like when I made the confit at 250F, and still the beans aren't any softer, altho the flavor does appear to have improved). In tracing my steps and re-reading the recipe, I am at a loss when it comes to figuring out what exactly I did or where I went wrong that turned what should have been an amazing dish into scrap. I would love to make this again, but have no idea where I could improve because it appears to have fundamentally failed. -Defeated In Seattle :(

This for me was a blast to make, lots of work but it was the real deal and worth it. I followed the directions to the letter and it was fantastic. Great presentation. I prepared the Duck Confit recipe from Epicusious 1999 and used the entire duck leg in the Cassoulet. outstanding! I had a dinner party for 9 so I had to buy a 9 1/4 quart Le Creuset Oval. I was able to get the Garlic sausage from "The Three Little Pigs" web page. The only variation was I used a whole lamb shank as I couldn't get mutton bones and added the meat after browning. Rave reviews!

Having just completed making Julia Child's multi-page version with duck, lamb and actual Toulouse sausage (Marcel & Henri brand from SF), I appreciate what Michael Lewis was attempting to do. Wish I had read his before I embarked on this monthlong journey, as I confit'd the duck myself earlier this month. Michael's colorful descriptions may irritate some sensibilities, but I agree about the disgusting duck rind. Had I read Michael's, I would have kept i n bigger pieces for easy removal instead of little triangles (per Julia) so that they get lost in amongst the beans. Fishing them out, once the beans were cooked, was awful, as I couldn't bring myself to leave them in.

One of the fussiest, most disorganized, hard-to-read recipes I've ever made. Still, having made cassoulet before I wanted to try it since it was adapted from Julia's recipe. The dish was delicious, but there are lots of cassoulet recipes that are easier and just as delicious. It's farm food, for heavn's sake. It's a pot of nicely flavored white beans with some sausage and duck confit baked in. No reason to get so baroque about it. Departures: I never shred the duck; everyone gets an identifiable leg, skinless, on the bone. The whole bottle of wine added to the stock would be way too much liquid, I didn't use it. Mutton bones? Ha, not in any grocery in my country. And why boil the pork fat first? Just skim the beans as you cook them with the fat. One hour of cooking wasn't enough to heat it through, expect 1.5 hours. Last thing: find a better recipe.

Loved making this, loved eating it. Next time I'm gonna make my own duck confit-buying it was too damn expensive. I also used duck fat instead of goose fat - couldn't find it!

I realize the chef was attempting humour, and I thought cooking should be enjoyable, I found the grade school descriptions extremely juvenile and unnecessary. The traditional recipe in itself is a lesson in degrees, you do this, do that, add such and so ingredients the best you can find and give it time to meld together. The ingredients listed are all complimentary of the dish, and outcome is very nice. Not many people have goose fat around, but it is an extremely tasty cooking by-product which makes it really special if you have it.

I recently invited a number of Vaishnava (commonly known as Hare Krishnas) to a dinner party at my house. For those of you who dont know it, Vaishnavas practice strict vegetarianism as part of their religion. I am a practical guy and as far as vegetarianism goes Im ok to with the occasional bending of the rules. A little chicken broth here, a beef bullion cube there, maybe a little pancetta in the salad. But Im sorry, this recipe just goes too far. For starters, did you know canard is French for duck? It sounded like some type of squash to me but its not. But I was already at the store and had seven Hare Krishnas coming for dinner in 6 hours so I went with it. Hey, chicken broth, duck, almost the same thing. Well I knew I was in trouble when the butcher started cracking the mutton bones. How the hell am I going to explain this to Goswami? I wondered aloud. As I made this recipe, I got more and more worried. I guess I should have read ahead before I chose this meal. The part entitled Nasty Work was a dead giveaway. You never see that in real vegetarian recipes, except maybe for ones with pumpkin in them. The dinner party was pretty much the disaster that youd imagine. My Vaishnava friends are very gracious and no one said anything. But they just moved the canard around the plate and cleaned me out of bread. So a word to the wise. This recipe, though delicious, is NOT vegetarian.

Meant to say as well: I used unsmoked pork belly and a small ham hock (with skin) to cook with the beans rather than the pork rind and bacon, since I had both handy, but it gave the same effect, I think, without quite as much of a mess.

We made a half recipe of this, halving everything but the duck confit and the spices. It still filled a 6.5-quart casserole and was definitely more than 5 servings! It fed 4 adults with leftovers enough, probably, for 4 more. We made a few small changes--duck fat instead of goose fat, soaked the beans in cold water overnight--but the biggest change was that I cooked the soaked beans and the meat mixture in the morning, and then did the deboning, assembly, and second cooking at night--8 hours is 8 hours, right? So it didn't take two days, unless you count the bean-soaking time. I was very pleased with the outcome and am looking forward to the leftovers.

Made this last year to bring to a football tailgate (!), and tripled the recipe. Got the confit mail order from one provider, the Sausicon Toulouse from another. I ended up using duck fat instead of goose fat, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. Took a long time, cost a small fortune, and was not headache free. I used an enormous cast iron dutch oven. Problem was, it wouldn't fit in my oven! Off to the store to buy a slightly less gigantic dutch oven, which worked out better. Finished it off, then packed it into the pickup for a trip from Boston to West Point for the game. Reheated over a propane fire ring and served to good reviews. Who cares what they thought; I certainly liked it and would make again.

Awesome flavour. I generally try to avoid recipes that use the words "pork rind" and "nipples" in relation to one another, but I'm awfully glad I made an exception in this case. Time consuming to be sure, but share the workload with a friend and a glass or two of wine in Stage 1 and you're well on your way to a stellar meal. I didn't substitute anything, other than using the fat I scraped off the confit for the 1 cup of goose fat. Speaking of the goose fat, it's likely that glutenous ingredient, plus the nine pounds of meat, that brings on a bout of wind that could knock a buzzard off a sh*& wagon, so, to steal a line from Simon Hopkinson, time to tether the duvet to the bedposts... plan accordingly.

My family requests that I make this dish each and every fall season. It is well worth the effort. If there is any left over, it freezes beautifully.

I love this 'haute' beans and weenies. Clearly one knows that the best meats will deliver the best flavor. I suggest the best BEAN - FLAGEOLET. If you are making a large batch (who wouldn't make a gigantic cassoulet?) mix the classic white beans with flageolet. The specialty groceries in my area charge an outragous sum, but I can find it cheaply in bulk at an Italian market. Flageolet beans are a beautiful pale green and have a mild grassy flavor.

PLERASE use tghe suggestions made by the cook from N.Y. on 2/13/04 and the cook from Chicago on 10/22/03. It won't work without their suggestions.

Excellent recipe and well worth the time invested. I tried swapping in a few different ingredients - smoked pheasant and andouille sausage - turned out great and have been making it every winter!

I have made this cassoulet several times, and every time it turns out wonderful. In the interest of time, I've made some short cuts and found they did not affect the flavor. I've left out the pork rind entirely, or substituted salt pork, and haven't used the bones since the first time. The bacon can be cut up before cooking and ground cloves, etc substituted for the bouquet garni. I've used chicken and vegetable stock and canned tomatoes. I've generally not shredded the duck meat, because I like the chunks, and used many different kinds of sausages, including chicken. A much lower fat version of this can be made too, with olive oil instead of duck fat, ommitting the pork rind and almost all the bacon and cutting down on the confit. Only a small amount needs to be used to flavor the entire dish. As long as really quality ingredients are used, like good sausage and fresh beans, this cassoulet will stand up to all sorts of variations, and will be the best you've ever tasted.

Quite good. Two of my guests had three helpings! I had to do a few substitutions and changes. First, I did not do the second cooking of the beans. Second, I had problems quickly finding the slab bacon. Rather than use the bacon, I used smoked ham hocks. Kind of a pain in the butt (however, any recipe that takes that long is going to have a few hassles). I also defatted the leftover broth from the meat and used a small lamb shank. BTW - what type of pot/pan did people use to cook the cassoulet in? I ended up heaping the cassoulet in to a 13x9 pyrex baking dish. Didn't quite have enough bread crumbs and parsely to adequate cover the dish. BTW - 2 1/2 confits is about 7 legs. At ~$4 a piece, this is an expensive dish. So much for French peasant food belonging to peasants!

I've seen many recipes for cassoulet through the years, and because I love beans, I've always wanted to try it. So after a week of preparation, and more of my grocery budget than I care to admit, it finally came together today. I did like how the beans were flavored and had to hold off eating them with before assembly. The meat mixture didn't really hold my interest, however. I would definitely omit the sausage - of any kind - as the the casings interfere with the texture. Speaking of texture, I would skip the second cooking of the beans, as I now have a $50 pot of mush. The bread crumbs no doubt contributed gluiness. Also, I would suggest draining the meat in a colander and refrigerating the broth to separate the fat. All in all, my 16-year old daughter tells me she liked it better when it was just 'duck' (I had to fight her off the confit).

This was way too much work but the guests ate every last bit and the taste was superb. I doubled the recipe for our group and by the time I had shredded 10 confit duck I could hardly use my hand. Sifting bacon was not necessary and I skipped the pork rind. Substituted breakfast sausage and the thyme therein worked beautifully. Removing the fat was the key - I made this over three days and the extra night in the frige allowed another skim of the coagulation. I will be making this again.

I made this to compare with a cassoulet I made in Normandy earlier this fall. There is a lot to be said for the excellent ingredients available to the French cook. This recipe passed with flying colors with my guests who were tasting Cassoulet for the first time. It paled in comparison to the French version made in a very limited kitchen but with the best ingredients. I agree with the previous writer. Take some of the fat out before serving.

I researched several cassoulet recipes before trying to make one for the first time, and Lewis' humor and in depth instructions grabbed me. I took liberties with a few of the ingredients. I used flageolet beans (delicious) and skipped the pork rind and lamb. I did use duck confit and andouille sausage. With the multi-day build up, I was expecting culinary fireworks. Instead, it turned out very subtle and nuanced. I will make this again, but in much larger quantities! It was gone too fast!

The 'Larousse Gastronomique', which Julia Child said would be her only cooking reference book, if allowed but one, states that "Purists insist on several refinements, such as rubbing the cooking pot with a garlic clove and, above all, breaking the gratin crust serveral times (seven times in Castelnaudary, and eight times in Toulose)." I thought that little bit of Cassoulet trivia was entertaining, and a reminder of how very SERIOUS this dish is. 8) Enjoy!

I made this dish for a dinner party of 12 and it was delicious. I didn't have to use any beefstock to cook the meat, but maybe I had less meat than the recipe called for? I used a little bit of cuck confit but mainly venison in place of most of the duck and the sausage.

This was one dish featured at an "everything French" dinner for 35 guests at my home. Very well received and most guests went back for seconds. I made the duck confit myself and omitted the pork rind step in a double batch. This dish is tedious to prepare but resulted in a stew with a very complex and satisfying flavor. The duck and fresh thyme are essential to the result.

Though I've rarely met a cassouley I didn't like, this is a real winner. Particularly since we are able to get artisanal sausages nearby and we make our own stock and confit.) But shouldn't the big skim of fat from the tomato mixture be removed? I certainly did.
