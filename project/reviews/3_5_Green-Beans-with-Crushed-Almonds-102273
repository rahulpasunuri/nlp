This recipe was delicious, except I thought ground almonds might create a messy presentation, so I just used sliced non-blanched almonds. Be careful to keep the heat low enough so as not to burn the garlic and nuts, especially before adding the beans.

Good enough that the kids asked for seconds of their vegetables. Easy enough that I would make it again.

Very good! I doubled it for four people. No leftovers. Lots of compliments.

So quick (used slivered almonds) and the green bean flavour was still clean. Will definitely use again.

Love this recipe. I make it all the time now. Never again will I buy canned green beans...

A great side dish. I served it with rabbit and it was a huge hit. The almonds are a great extra touch.

I received loads of compliments on it. Instead of grinding the almonds, I bought slivered almonds and toasted them under the broiler for a few minutes. Yum!

I thought this was good, but I tasted the garlic much more than the almonds.

I quadrupled this for a crowd, coarsely ground the almonds, and used 6 garlic cloves. Also, I used both freshly ground sea salt & pepper. Being sure to not grind the almonds too fine is key as well. Definitely a pretty side dish for entertaining & very delicious.

I think we've made this at least a dozen times now. An absolute staple, it's the only way we do green beans these days. So flavorful and really a novel twist on an old classic. Again and again guests rave about these -- truly a must.

I added some baby carrotts to this recipe and steamed them for about 6 minutes and then tossed the combination into the butter mixture. It was a super hit! Very nice color, and yes I added salt and pepper and sprinkled with slivered almonds.

This was a great complement to the rib roast with herbed marinade and salt crust recipes found on this site. I followed the recipe exactly as written . The taste was mildly nutty as expected and was a great foil to the well-seasoned roast. Paired with regular 'ole mashed potatoes and gravy, you can't go wrong.

Sooooo simple yet sooooo flavorful. I didn't crush the almonds (just used sliced ones) and I think it was perfect.

super easy and delicious - as the other cook explained, seasoning with salt and pepper is key. I also doubled the garlic portion like the others, and used slivered almonds. this will be my regular green bean dish from now on.

This recipe was good, but I spiced it up a bit by adding a ton more garlic and balsmic glaze. I sauteed the garlic in butter, then added the almonds. Last I added the balsamic glaze and beans. My gourmet club raved about it.

I can't believe I'm giving a recipe that is so basic a three-fork rating, but it deserves it. I made the recipe as stated, and it was delicious. My guests couldn't get enough. This is a nice dinner-party side--it looks and tastes great, but it's very simple to prepare. I'll definitely make again.

I took everyone's advice and used sliced almonds-- definetely a good idea. Also, I toasted the almonds for 2-3 minutes in the oven before I used them in the pan- also a good idea. Great side dish for fish.

I followed the recipe and doubled it. Too many crushed almonds absorbed all the butter and left the beans dry. If I made these again I would definitely follow advice of other reviewers and try sliced or coarsely grated almonds.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and crushed the almonds. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought that these were the best green beans I've ever had! They weren't too mushy. They weren't too crunchy, either. They were perfect! I'm not sure what I did, but they ended up with a smoky flavor that was fantastic! My only complaint was that the almonds weren't crunchy after they were cooked. They were soft. Perhaps I didn't use quality almonds.

This has become a regular item for me to prepare! It's so easy and good! It's easy to make for large crowds. I have been using Sunkist Oven Roasted Sliced Almonds. This works well and saves time.

I made this side dish with toasted, slivered almonds, and it was wonderful! The almonds were a delightful addition to the green beans. It is very easy to make and a real crowd pleaser! There was none left!

THESE ARE GOOD! I tried a similar recipe to this awhile ago and found the ground nuts made the whole dish gritty in the final product. So I took the advice of previous reviewers, and ground them coarsely (leaving out any of the fine powdery nut) and that did the trick. My husband went back and scraped out the last couple of beans and nuts from the pan he liked them so much! Also, if you liked this recipe, try "Green Beans with Pecan Pesto" on this site, another good one.

Great green beans! I toasted the almonds, but only chopped them up fairly coarsely. With such a simple recipe, seasoning with salt and pepper is very important (to the folks who find this recipe bland).

Rating: 4
For a green bean recipe, this is great! I have made this twice, once as written and again with toasted almonds crushed to a coarse texture. The ground almonds were definitely inferior. I may throw some chopped shalllots in with the garlic when I make it again next week. This recipe multiplies well for larger groups.

I bought pre-toasted, sliced almonds from the store and made this for 30 people, it was a huge hit.

After slaving away over stuffing and gratin potatoes for Christmas dinner (I'm the only one in my family who cooks!) I prepared these simple green beans as a side dish. They were a huge hit and I would definitely make them again -- for a holiday dinner or just a weeknight meal, they're that easy. I doubled the amount of green beans, increased the butter to 2 Tbsp. and used 2 cloves of garlic. But most importantly, I used slivered almonds (instead of crushed whole) and I think they were a great addition. A great way to dress up green beans.

Delicious and simple. For simple everyday meals I do without the almonds but use ample amounts of garlic and substitute vegetable oil for the butter. Goes well with other Chinese stir fried dishes. .

This was so delicious and easy. I used slivered almonds (for the consistency and looks) and toasted them first. I would use just a touch of garlic next time because the almonds, butter, and garlic together were too strong for the beans. Can even make this without garlic. Or try shallots.

I didn't have almonds so used walnuts instead -- very good. It was easy to make, and nothing overpowered the fresh green bean taste.

This is a wonderful way to make green beans, a real winner! I used frozen baby green beans (Trader Joe's) and slivered almonds instead of ground. It definitely intensifies the flavor to lightly toast the nuts first.

A great veggie dish, I roasted the almonds before grinding them for added flavor. My family loved them!

This was quick, delicious, and appetizing. I also toasted the almonds.

I have been looking for a side dish that won't over power my main dish and this is it! It's got great flavor but isn't over bearing and can go great with everything. I also toasted the almonds.

An "okay" side dish somewhat on the bland side. More garlic might help. I roasted the almonds before grinding them.

The best green beans I've ever had. My kids (ages 3 and 7) both said, "Can we have these every night?!"
