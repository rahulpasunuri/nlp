I gotta go with "A Cook from Republic fo the Rio Grande" on this one...I used two whole chipotles, seeds and all plus about a tablespoon of the adobo sauce. I also used corn instead of Hominy and added two cubed sweet potatoes that I par boiled before adding. I din't use the water the recipe calls for and used an additional can of diced tomatoes with juices. I added a touch of vegetable broth (in lieu of water). Will definitely make again! So easy!

A good meal for winter? No. Ever notice that cuisines gets spicier the closer they get to the tropics or equator? That's because spicy food opens up the pores and makes you sweat, which makes you cool down. Spicy food is perfect for summer. Or mostly year round down here in South Texas. BTW, are there really people who think one chipotle is hot? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA I always err on the side of too much spice in recipes from people north of the Pedernales River. In this case, I used the two chipotles (with seeds) to get the right mix of flavor, and threw in some dashes of Cholula hot sauce, to get a good amount of heat. Water is also way too bland for a recipe like this, beef broth too heavy, chicken too weird and wine all wrong. So I used my last bit of vegetable broth. It made the dish a bit more complex, and much more savory than it would have been with water alone. I also used frozen white corn instead of hominy. Nobody in my family likes hominy.

This was good, very good. I doubled the recipe. I don't think the regular recipe would be enough for 4 hungry people. As it was, my husband and I polished off a good portion of it. I added a 7 oz jar of piquillo peppers I had in the pantry, and served it with fresh cilantro, some cotija cheese, and warm corn tortillas. I think THE HOMINY IS A MUST, it wouldn't be the same with just regular corn. For the double recipe I used 2 of the chipotles and some sauce. It could have been spicier, but this was good if you are not sure how people are with spice. Next time I will add one more. I was hoping to have enough to freeze, but with what we ate tonight, and lunches for tomorrow, there won't be any left! Next time I will quadruple the recipe!

I make this in a crock pot and it's a wonderful make ahead dish. Just do everything up until simmer for an hour and a half. At that point, put the dish in the fridge, and the next morning, pour it into the crock pot and set the crock pot on low. I shred the meat when it's done cooking, then add the hominy and put the crock pot on high and simmer for fifteen minutes and serve. It's work the night before, but coming home to a house smelling of chipotle beef stew is a nice reward. And a salad rounds out the meal.

This was a great winter dinner. I'd recommend removing the seeds from the chipotle peppers or using no more than 1 pepper. I also used a combination of boneless pork and steak tips instead of stew beef. Very tender and delicious. Definitely use beef stock instead of water and added extra onion and red pepper strips for more of a stew consistency.

I didn't make this so I'm giving it the average # of forks so as not to change the rating. I saw a comment asking what size can. For those who found this too hot--the recipe calls for 1 to 2 CANNED chipotles (read 1 to 2 peppers) not 1-2 cans.

I thought this was fantastic! I cooked it in the crock pot for 4 hrs and then added a can of corn (instead of hominy) for about another 3 hrs. It is spicy (I added 2 peppers w/out seeds and 2 tbsp of sauce), but not too spicy. This will definitely be a family tradition.

This recipe was so simple and tasted great! I have made it a couple of times and added more chipotle peppers on the second batch to give it a little extra kick. It also freezes very well.

I expected more from this dish but something was just missing....

This was a tasty dish. No offense to others but the amount of chipotle was just right for me. Added a splash of bourbon toward the end and cooked uncovered to evaporate the alcohol a little bit. Also, due to lack of planning, I used corn in place of hominy . Still great.

what size can for the chili`s ?

A great alternative to "regular" beef stew. I added some red and yellow peppers an hour or so into cooking and used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I also let it simmer for a lot longer, maybe 4 hours, and it was very tender. Nicely smoky!

My husband loved this -- it reminded him of menudo -- and I thought it was good. Browned the meat, deglazed with a bit of beef broth and sauteed the onions/garlic. Then threw everything (beef broth substituted for water) except the hominy in a crock pot for 4 hours. Then added the hominy and cooked on low for another 3 hours. Very tender meat and great depth of flavor. Used both peppers but seeded them first to take some of their fire away. Served on a small bed of pasta and even my 3 year old gobbled it up. Might try adding some red pepper chunks next time to add interest, but overall an easy and tasty dish.

We loved this. A very nice twist on stew. I did recipe per exactly per instructions. Served it with tortillas and cheese (in case husband wanted to roll it up all together).

THIS DISH IS VERY EASY AND DELICIOUS. IT'S HEARTINESS IS WELCOME ON A COLD WINTER EVENING. I SERVE IT WITH FRESH TORTILLAS FROM A LOCAL GROCERY, A CRISP GREEN SALAD AND COLD BEER! WE HAVE MADE THIS DISH OFTEN SINCE WE FIRST READ IT IN GOURMET A FEW YEARS AGO.

this was a good recipe for us. i used one pepper and one tbsp, but ended up adding more sauce later. i, too, cooked it whole. toward the end i shredded it in large pieces and served it over pasta. it was very good.

i really really liked how easy this was - i had a chuck roast, cut into cubes, etc. 2 things i did different - i put the tomato mixture on top of the onion/garlic mixture and cooked it for about 15 minutes - just to take the "raw" taste out - then i added the beef and put the top on and simmered for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. also, just cause i didn't have any, i didn't add the hominy - it was excellent just the same - fyi - i gave it a 3 cause a 4 to me is just waaayyy up there...

Fabulous recipe! I used stew meat and simmered for an extra 30 minutes to really tenderize meat. 1 chipotle and 1/2 tablespoon adobo sauce is plenty of heat...Subbed some stock for the water -- hominy is great in here! I like the texture more than corn kernels. Oh, and I skipped the pureeing step -- with the increased simmering time, the stew was pretty homogenous without dirtying the blender. Perfect for the frigid weather.

Great recipe. Although it's an easy dish to prepare, I was feeling particularly lazy and did not cube the beef. I browned the adobo-seasoned chuck roast on both sides and threw the onions in at the end. I upped the garlic to three cloves and substituted beef broth for the water and threw a few sprigs of fresh cilantro into the salsa. This simmered for over two hours and I shredded the beef which was by then fork tender and served it with rice, refried beans and a salad. The spiciness was just right for us but may be too spicy for some. Just to be safe I'd tone it down to one chipotle and one spoonful of sauce if company was coming over. I can't wait to taste it reheated tomorrow. I'll be making this again and again.

This was pretty darn good. Used chicken broth instead of water (a good idea for ANY dish). Did not get hotter the next day like everyone is saying.

I liked it,including the hominy. My husband,who is Mexican,liked it a lot. Used the smaller amount of chipotle and sauce. For those who cook ahead of time,or have leftovers,be aware that it will get spicier as it sits.

My wife and I were extremely pleased with the end result of this recipe. One of our favorite restaurants in Columbus is Cuban and this was as good as anything we have had there. We served this with a side of Cuban-Style Black Beans (also on this site) and white rice. It was a great combination. As many others, we also substituted corn for the hominy. We used two chipotle chiles and two tablespoons of adobo sauce and it was spicy, but just right.

As the author knows it was very cold in Chicago last evening and I finally got around to making the stew. It was delicious and perfect fro a chilly night. I used the other reviewers' suggestions and substituted corn for the hominy - worked very well. Thank you - am taking recipe with me on a trip today to make for someone else.

One chile and 2 spoons of adobo does it for me. This delicious dish is fiery, and well it should be. I doubled the cumin seed and added roughly 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro at the end of the cooking time. Kudos to the author of this recipe!

This was worse than a 1 fork!! My husband & I both thought this stew was terrible. I did the 2 chilies and 2 tablespoons of sauce so the sauce was very spicy. It sat overnight before we ate it and the meat didn't seem to absorb any of the flavor. The only other ingredient of any substance was the hominy which was oh so flavorless!!

I made this last night with 2 chillis, seeded, and it blew the roof off our mouths--I thought I liked spicy foods! Still, once we mellowed it with a little sour cream, we really enjoyed the flavor. I liked the hominy, but my husband was not pleased--I'll use some corn next time.

A fiery dish! Next time I'll use one pepper. I would also use a better cut of meat for less prep time. For variation and to tame the heat, corn would be a good addition as would pinquitos beans. We thoroughly enjoyed it the second day too.

Tasty, hearty and very easy to make. Even the kids cleaned their plates. I used one Chipotle pepper and one tablespoon of adobo sauce. That gave the dish some kick without being too spicy for the kids. No fan of hominy, I substituted a can of corn, drained and rinsed--the result was colorful and delicious. I served it over rice. This dish is great to prepare the night before. I got it to the point of adding the corn, then refrigerated it overnight and finished it quickly the next night. I think doing this also mellowed the slightly bitter, smoky taste Chipotle dishes sometimes have. This dish will definitely become a regular at our house.
