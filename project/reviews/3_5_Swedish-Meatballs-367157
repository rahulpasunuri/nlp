I've made this before as per the recipe and found the meatballs a bit too salty, the sauce a bit bland and also insufficient for accompanying noodles. This time I used only a teaspoon of salt but i doubled the allspice. I also doubled the sauce. Finally I added sliced mushrooms sauted in truffle oil to the sauce and it turned out great. Will def make again

I would definitely make this again, but I would increase the allspice and nutmeg and double the sauce recipe. Also, browning the meatballs on a rack on a jellyroll pan for about 20 minutes in a 500 degree oven saves loads of time and work.

I thought it was delicious. However, I did add more allspice to the gravy for flavor, and yes, you do need more gravy for noodles

I thought was just ok, but my comfort-food loving husband LOVED this. Will make again for his benefit for sure. I left out the nutmeg (hate it!), reduced the allspice a bit, and doubled the quantity of sauce based on previous reviews - glad I did. Served over egg noodles.

I made a large batch for an open house and they were perfectly delicious.

Having made this recipe several times, I have a few suggestions. First, cook the bacon THEN remove it and saute onion in drippings. The recipe doesn't say but chip the bacon into the meatballs. Use much less butter, if any. Finally, the way it is served at IKEA is over egg noodles with lingonberries on the side. Definitely 'kid friendly'.

I really liked these, and passed the recipe along to my mother, who replaced her decades-long Swedish meatball recipe! The bacon, allspice, and nutmeg was a pleasantly surprising flavor combination. I thought 1 Tablespoon salt was WAY too much so I added a scant 1/2 Tablespoon and it was plenty salty. Next time I would double the sauce. I served with egg noodles.

These really were a lot of work. I subbed turkey for the beef (only cause a guest didn't eat red meat) and added a bit of sherry and tomato paste to the gravy (when it needed a little more "umami" flavor). They were a huge hit at the new years eve dinner we attended! Kids and adults went crazy! Served over buttered noodles.

Only OK...not worth making again, nothing special. Made exactly as noted. Blah!

Made these for a potluck, and everyone was so glad not to have the same old chili sauce & grape jelly concoction over pre-made meatballs that I have been asked to make this again already. Nice combination of seasonings, and I also added a bit of chopped fresh dill to the sauce. Yum!

This is an absolutely divine recipe for meatballs, I will make it again and again. I agree with the other reviews, it is a tad time consuming but the end result is truly worth it. The only variations I made were to use Panko bread crumbs and turkey bacon. The salt level was perfect for me, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, but I did have approximately 1.25 pounds of ground beef, and 1 pound of ground pork. Thank you for the amazing recipe.

These meatballs were delicious, and a big hit at a recent cocktail party. I would pay attention to the salt in this dish though. I cut the salt in half, it was too much for my liking. Also, store bought bread crumbs and stock tend to have salt in them already.

This was very unexpected 4 forks! Made a few changes, added garlic to onions, added and extra 1/2 c of bread crumbs because it looked too loose. used whole pound of pork. baked at 450 for 20 mins. used bacon fat for base, 3 tb of flour, 3 c beef stock, added mushrooms, sherry, and estonian mustard. finished with 3 tb of room temp sour cream. served with buttered egg noodle with parley and green onions. husband approved!

Spectacular! So very good. We followed the recipe with the exception of adding about 2 tbls vermouth to the gravy which really made the flavour pop. We did end up adding a bit more flour to make the gravy thicken to our liking, as well. We served this over egg noodles tossed with butter and about a 1/4 cup finely chopped flat leaf parsley. We also served it with a small side of heated lingonberry jam. It was a bit time consuming, but so absolutely worth it. So full of flavour. We will definitely make it again!

Excellent meatballs. The bacon is a nice touch. You can really taste the nutmeg and the pepper. My wife thought they were a little sweet - the sugar, and I think the bacon I used, is a different flavor. And absolutely add the cream at the end, almost at room temp, right before serving to avoid separation.

These were mind-bogglingly delicious. I used turkey instead of pork, otherwise followed the recipe. The gravy us so amazingly flavorful.

Really lovely, tender meatballs! Was a last minute decision and didn't have any bacon. Substituted butter for bacon fat. Still delicious! Also got tired of pan frying (had guests and didn't manage to prep this beforehand)so stuck in oven on baking tray and then continued with simmering. Yummy.

Yum yum these taste just like swedish meatballs should, only thing is maybe they're a little too greasy I'd cut back to 1 bacon strip next time (and I only used 2 tbsp butter not 4). I did make mine slightly too big, the suggested 1 tbsp size is just right. Also, the recipe neglects to tell the reader one very important tip...anyone who's ever cooked traditional European comfort food using sour cream knows it MUST be almost completely cooled before adding it, otherwise it separates immediately.

My husband loves these! But cut the salt in half, or they are almost inedible. I added a clove of garlic with the onion and cooked the finely minced veggies and 2 slices of minced cooked bacon together with some butter. I baked the meatballs in a hot oven until almost cooked through and then finished them in the sauce, which I doubled. I serve the dish dish with boiled potatoes and loganberry preserve. Yum!

I actually only used one slice bacon to cut down on the fat, and my family loved them. Served with egg noodles soaked in beef broth and a little butter, salt and pepper.

This was good...I cut down the salt by half, and added an extra slice of bacon. I was also generous with the sour cream. Served with egg noodles and sauteed brussel sprouts.

Good, a little time consuming, a tad salty for my taste. Would cut salt, and add a few more breadcrumbs.
