I was looking for an alternative to my kid's often requested 'cheesy noodles'. I used this recipe as a base but made a homemade alfredo sauce to add to it (butter, whipping cream, parmesan) instead of saving the water. We also grilled some chicken breasts and sliced and added them on top. The arugula was a nice addition as I like the spiciness of arugula and we've got a ton in the garden right now. In the end, we felt like the beans detracted from the dish. The pasta mostly tasted earthy like the beans. Perhaps it was the type of organic beans we used :) I used four cloves of garlic and could not taste the garlic at all. I would not make the recipe as written. It would be horribly bland. I will use elements of this recipe in the future for pasta recipes (butter and garlic, wilted arugula) but would likely not add the beans again. With the alfredo sauce, the dish was far better.

This was incredibly bland. I added lemon juice and italian seasoning and it still had next to no flavor at all. Very disappointing.

I don't like reviewing a recipe that I changed but the changes were simple and the recipe was essentially the same. It was quick, easy and delicious. I used penne,spring baby lettuce and 2 extra garlic cloves. I added green beans, white wine and parsley. yummy and light.
