Love this! Served with Grilled Rosemary Garlic Shrimp (Gourmet, June 1994) and fettuccine alfredo per request of friends, and it was fabulous. Wouldn't change a thing!

This has become my go-to recipe for our mushrooms. I cut the sugar in half, to suit our taste.

Made this yesterday for a dinner party! It was a huge hit and friends asked for the recipe. Marinated meat 1 1/2 days. As most BBQ'rs know...9 minutes per side would result in well done not med rare. This is a keeper!

This has become a Thanksgiving staple in our house - not only to serve with the meal, but also for use as a sandwich topping the next day. Very easy to make, and very flexible. I've substituted different vinegars and mushrooms and have always gotten a delicious outcome. Highly recommended!

This is a strong recipe, easy & quick to prepare. As noted by the other reviewers, the flavors can be adjusted, especially the sugar, but that is no reason to shy away. We served it with a pine nut & pesto risotto & broiled salmon which was unanimously acclaimed. The only thing I would change the next time is to add some color to the plate, even if the color wasn't edible.

Unbelievably simple. I made this last night, but I was only cooking for myself. I am usually so bad at this, but I eyed the amounts, just making sure that the ratios were somewhat comparable. It turned out incredibly! I put in about 1/4 stick of unsalted butter, one large shallot, two scallions, and just slightly lowered the amounts of vinegar, soy sauce and sugar (although the sugar I only put about a tablespoon in, based on what the other reviewers suggested). It really turned out beautifully. Make sure to season to taste. Once the vinegar/soy/sugar mixture reduces, it takes on a lovely rich dark brown color, and becomes almost like a glaze. I served it over breaded pork chops and wild rice. The sweetness was the perfect contribution to the dish. So SO very easy and delicious...and I'm a rookie cook if ever there was one!

Made this with slightly less sugar and it turned out fabulous. I've been standing at the stove eating the rest of it out of the cast iron skillet. I will serve it over risotto sometime.

Tasty. The sauce added depth to the mushrooms, though I don't think it needs as much sugar as called for because of the reduced balsamic. Be careful though, I salted the mushrooms as directed and even with low-sodium soy found it almost too salty.

Yummy. Because of cost and laziness, I took another reviewer's advice and skipped the portabellas. Not a dish-ruining mistake, but I'll bet they would've made this even better. Next time.

Next time I'd use only the Cremini. The dark gills of the portabellos make the reduced sauce look like ink, even though I scraped out as much of that as I could before cooking.

Really nice side dish when you're preparing a special meal. Those mushrooms really reduce in size!

Tasty enough to be eaten by itself!

Very yummy! The sweetness of sugar mixed in with the tasty vinegar and soy sauce made the mushrooms delicious. We added them to our baked potatoes but I found them to be perfect by themselves. I was eating the remaining mushrooms out of the bowl.

I read the recipe a few weeks ago, and forgot some ingredients, i.e. the scallions, and only used portabella. This was wonderful. I served with chicken wrapped in prosciutto which we overcooked, to the point of inevitable, but these were so lovely they freshened it right back up again. Fantastic recipe, the taste is superb. Can't wait to try it with the scallions! I also used a good quality balsimic, and far less mushrooms than mentioned. These are so rich that you can quarter this recipe and 4 people will be content as side dish. Going to try again tomorrow for brunch on bruchetta. Next summer a keeper for barbeques - with burgers, steak pork, and chicken.

I'm not sure why everyone's been raving about this - although I used all sorts of mushrooms in the dish, it was a shame that the sauce was so intense that it covered the flavours of them all...all I could taste was the vinegar. My husband liked it over steak. Would choose a much lighter sauce next time.

Simple and delicious. Can really throw in any mushrooms you have on hand. Served this as a brunch side for Easter with quiche and a green salad.

Delilcious! The sauce was wonderful and I only used Portabella mushrooms. will definitely make again!

This is the first dish I've ever reviewed beacuse it is also the first dish from this site that my family has demanded that I make again. It is so easy I will do so often! I substitued button for Cremini because there were no fresh to be had and backed off the sugar a bit. Served it over polenta with a nice zin. The pefect Autumn meal!

Really liked this dish, especially with lamb loin chops. I halved the sugar and would recommend making more of the sauce because it was yummy!

Delicious! And an easy and fast meal. We served it over polenta surrounded by stir-fried sugar snaps and red bell pepper strips. It needs the color for presentation, since it is a "brown" entree. You could also garnish with chopped herbs for color. A wonderful dish!

I thoroughly enjoyed these mushrooms with a grill NY tenderloin but they were a bit sweet. When reduced balsamic becomes syrupy and sweet so next time I will half the sugar. Other than that very yummy

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Although I had not made it before I used only 1 -2 T of the soy sauce since I wanted the balsamic vinegar to be the predominate flavor. I am looking forward to making it again and again.

Rating: 4
wonderful dish. I made it into a meal by toasting sourdough bread and rubbed it with a garlic clove on one slice, then spread goat cheese on the other, then added slivered fresh basil, roasted red peppers adn then the mushroom mixture. My husband raved! I also didn't use butter to saute the mushrooms but a spray of pam and a teas of olive oil.

These mushrooms are out of this world! They are intense and sweet and were a huge hit at a dinner party. I agree with the reviewer who said that they are good enough to be eaten on their own as a vegetarian sandwich (perhaps on ciabatta bread?). I took it easy on the sugar but used all the other ingredients as written. I also continued to cook the mushrooms long enough to reduce the sauce to intensify the flavors. Can't say enough good things about this recipe - just YUMMY!

Rating: 3
Very good. Didn't use quite all soy mixture and put less sugar in, and they were delicious.

Rating: 4
I have made these mushrooms about 4 or 5 times now. They are always a hit and are good on any type of grilled steak. I have never used the Crimini mushrooms in the recipe and add less sugar. It turns out great without the sugar too. YUMMY!!

A superb blending of ingredients, rich, very pleasing to to all the senses. The portabella mushrooms, in particular, are a must, the perfect choice. The "grilled flank steak" an excellant accompaniment.

I served this to a group of mushroom lovers along with a grilled sirloin steak - everyone loved them. Two days later we had steak sandwiches on hard rolls with the leftover steak and mushrooms -another great meal. These are good enough to serve as a vegetarian sandwich.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic! Made this along with the grilled flank steak recipe and the mushrooms were the big hit (the steak was good too). Intended to make a full recipe but ended up making only half (after already chopping the shallots) so I had twice the amt. of shallots, and I omitted the scallions as my husband does not care for them, but the dish was wonderful

Rating: 3
Wonderful! The balsamic adds a very bold flavor to these. I'll admit - I used white button mushrooms (they were already in the 'fridge)and it was still wonderful. I look forward to making this again with the correct mushrooms - it can only be better!

This is real good. My friend cooked it for me and it is real good!

One of my absolute favorite recipes. Have made it with the portabellas and creminis, and with the criminis alone, and it's delicious either way. Dying to try the cream of mushroom soup suggestion, but can't manage to have any leftovers!

Made this for a dinner part of eight. Not a single mushroom was left over! Served with marinated flank steak (which also consists of balsamic, soy sauce, shallots & sugar). Next time, I'll make the mushrooms ahead and just heat them up and reduce the sauce. Fabulous flavor - easy to make.

This is a excellent way to fix mushrooms. I used regular brown mushrooms, and it worked fine. Definitly would make this recipe again.

This was fabulous. Our grocery store doesn't have shallots, so used green onions and cut down on the sugar as suggested. I plan to make again today!

I made a half recipe and used shitaki mushrooms along with the other two. Only used about a teaspoon of sugar and would probably drop that next time. Served over steak, mmmmm mmmm good!

This is a favourite recipe of mine that has consistantly thrilled the tongues and choppers of friends many times. Everyone for whom I prepare this always--without fail--ask me for the recipe. And the gals for whom I've made this have always returned for seconds. ;-)

These mushrooms with the balsamic vinegar were delicious beyond compare. I took the leftover mushrooms, added some chicken stock and some milk and cream, pureed it and had mushroom soup to die for. This recipe is the start of many a wonderful dish.

This was an alright recipe. I agree with many of the reviewers before me - strong sauce. What I'm going to do is to put far less balsamic and far less sugar. It's sweet enough as it is. I may venture into it again with some drastic measures.

This was really good. I had 1 1/2 pounds of button mushrooms in my fridge for awhile and needed to use them up. Since I had shallots and green onions too, this recipe was perfect. I love balsamic vinegar and did not find it too overpowering. My only mistake was serving them as a side to pasta w/ marinara. They didn't seem to blend very well. I kind'a figured they wouldn't go together, but what the hey! When Thursday's roll around, sometimes it's whatever I can find! This would be great with steak, or anything with a teriyaki sauce. Bon Appetite!

This was wonderful! Used button, cremini and portabella. Cooked less than 3lbs of mushrooms but used the entire sauce recipe. We kept the leftovers and put them over hamburgers the next day. If you don't like balsamic vinegar that much, try adding a little at a time to the sugar/soy sauce mix. This is going in my "loved it" file!

Great recipe. I used white button mushrooms instead of cremini and white onion instead of shallots. Delicious side dish for grilled steak.

Excellent! The balsamic wasn't too powerful for me, Baby! This is an ideal side for any type of beef. I wouldn't change the recipe at all.

This is an excellent recipe for Protabella mushroom (I don't use the Cremini). The balsamic is pretty strong but if you use it as a topping to a grilled steak it is superb.

Made this dish for a dinner party where I had a vegetarian, didn't even use the cremini, just the portabella. Fabulous. Everyone raved. Served them with carmelized onions,horseradish potatoes and Gordon's (great recipe on epicurious) Pot roast recipe (for the carnivores at the table.) Excellent!!

I served this over pan fried polenta and it was delicious. However, I only used 1/2 the butter and next time will decrease the amount of balsamic, which was a bit overpowering.

Absolutely delicious. I made it with the flank steak but it would be just great with any meal. And regular mushrooms will do. I added some fresh garlic and served it over the steak. Yum. Their is a lot of cooking of the mushrooms and they shrink dramatically, so get lots!

Simply the best I've ever eaten! These mushrooms are so good and so easy, I will fix them for everyday meals as well as for special dinners. It goes great with grilled chicken or pork, too. I substituted white button mushrooms for the creminis and left out the shallots, and it was still WONDERFUL. These mushrooms are addictive!

I thought the balsamic vinegar was a bit overpowering, so I added more soy sauce and WOW! Please note that I was using Lite Soy Sauce. I suggest marinating it overnight. The leftovers were better the next day!! I will make this again and again.

I made this recipe on Christmas Eve with roasted pork loin. It was fabulous -- everybody raved. In retrospect, I probably would have cut down the butter a bit too. It tasted even better reheated the second day with leftover pork. The sugar and balsamic had really set in. I strongly recommend it -- would be great with mashed potatoes.

My family loves this dish, but sometimes cuts back on the butter to no real loss of flavor (using about 3/4 stick)

This is great with grilled steak or a roasted filet mignon. The flavor is somewhat sweet, but that's what makes it taste so good. I wouldn't accompany it with another strong side dish, it's too good to be outdone by another side.

We loved it! What a wonderful flavor... I substituted oyster mushrooms and shitaki mushrooms for the portabellas and served it on top of crusty french bread with grilled tomatoes (bruschetta style). It was a hit with every guest.

Delicious! Felt it was time for a change from the regular sauteed mushrooms with the steak so decided to try something different. I used regular white mushrooms as didn't have any portabella and couldn't find cremini mushrooms. Very quick and easy and better than I expected. Will definitely become a new favourite!

We tried this recipe last summer when we had guest over for a cookout. We also cooked the flank steak as suggested. What a treat. Last night we tried to find the recipe again but could not find the June '98 issue of Gourmet so we had to "guess" what the ingrediants were. I must say that my "guess" did not compare to the original so I decided to try to find this recipe on the web. So glad that it is here. Alex Indianapolis
