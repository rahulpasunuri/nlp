My husband and I love these,we always have to make a double batch. Because we share with family and neighbors. He doesn't frost them though we like them the way they are with out the glaze.

Helpful tips: The dough is easier to work with based on the temperature of the butter. They rise! So be cautious of the size. Avoid wax paper. Pam is your friend. In taste and form they seem to be a distant cousin of a biscuit. Use Driscoll's berries! They worked wonderfully!

The boyfriend was just complaining about the rose petal ice cream I brought home almost two years ago... So when I found this recipe, I was anxious to try it out -- to change his mind about rose-flavored things... But I only had blueberry jam on hand, so I ended up making thse with the blueberry jam and lavender extract in the icing instead. The scones were delicately textured -- fluffy, even. The blueberry jam went surprisingly well with the lavender glaze, and was even better the second day. I guess it's a "purple" thing. Even the boyfriend loved them...

I haven't made these yet, but for those who read the 2008 review by "dawnkv1 from pasadena" and are discouraged, thinking that rose water is "poisonous" or "for external use only" and don't know otherwise, there are several different kinds: the rose water meant for skin care, rose water meant for culinary purposes, and rose extract, also for culinary purposes. King Arthur Flour has a great selection, and I highly recommend the orange flower water (fiori di sicilia) for almost anything and everything baked (esp. french toast).

Darling scones though fairly labor intensive. Making the mix is easy but the dough is so sticky that it's hard to get them out of the heart-shaped cookie cutter and even harder to cut them horizontally to drop in the raspberry jam. I used a fancy but thin/running jam and that caused it to run out the sides more than I would have liked. Made these last Valentine's Day and really disliked the overpowering taste of rose water so this year I substituted 1/4 tsp. almond extract and it complements the raspberry very well! Tip: I would flour the work surface before shaping the dough and I would flour the knife and the cookie cutter each time you cut out a scone to help with the stickiness. Even with this I found it hard to manage the scones didn't keep their shape as well as I would have liked. With the icing, they make for REALLY cute Valentine's treats.

These were soooooo delicious and soooo easy! Great presentation. Delicate and crispy on the outside and light & soft on the inside. Made exactly as noted - except rose water... Delicious with or without the glaze. YUMMM!

This tasted really good, and the only comment I would say was that I had to put way more cream in it than just a cup. Instead of having rose water, I put a raspberry tea bag into the 3 T of cream and put it in the fridge overnight. That added an additional flavor to the glaze instead of just cream and sugar.

I couldn't get the heart-shape (or any shape for that matter) to stay. I ended up reforming all the dough into a 1/2 inch thick circle and cut them in the shape of pie slices. And, rather than fighting to cut them in half, i just had 'tops' and 'bottoms'. As a result, I had to bake them 5 minutes longer, but they taste wonderful!! I found rose water, but it said 'external use only' and rather than poison my husband on v'day, I skipped it - the glaze was perfect without it.

The shape of these scones didn't hold up too well for me because I think I patted the dough too thin. Since the dough was sticky it was hard to cut in half and insert the jam without ruining the shape of the hearts. The scones tasted good however and a few came out looking perfect.

I was very pleased with the result of this recipe. These scones are fairly easy to make and require very little preparation time. They make excellent snacks or party deserts. I certainly plan on making these again!

Not impressed at all. Very biscuity. Heart shape held well but I will not make these again.

This was a good basic scone. What really made it delightful were homemade raspberry jam and LOTS of rosewater in the glaze. Also, used whole-wheat flour, which balanced the sweetness of the jam and glaze well.

I make these again and again! This time, I pressed the dough into the bottom of muffin pans, pressed out thin (make sure it has high edges!) and filled with jam -- I didn't put a cover on them. They turned out fantastic! Perfect size, and it kept the jam from leaking everywhere!

I am 11 years old. I picked this recipe out and made it. The dough got sticky -- I think you should add a little more flour. I made the indentations and it worked out really well. I liked its taste and its crispiness, and the glaze added a nice touch. I didn't get 12 scones, but I did get enough to feed my family (of four, with some seconds). It's a good intermediate recipe for kids, but not for beginners. I will definitely make it again.

I love these. Everyone who tries them loves them. I double and make them in mini scone pans, pat half into bottom, indent with thumb and add raspberry jam, then cover with triangle shaped pieces, makes 2 bite scones. Mmmmm.

I'm not entirely sure that I would catagorize these as scones--perhaps more along the lines of biscuits. They were good, though not fantastic. They might have been improved by rolling out the dough thicker than 1/2" before cutting. I would recommend eating them warm, even though the glaze doesn't set, as they taste much better fresh from the oven.

Delicious and easy to make! My husband typically hates scones, but he had seconds on these. Will definitely make again.

I started making these for breakfast with doubt, they turned out just great.Every body in my family liked them, from my 5 years old son to my picky neighbor who asked for the recipe rightaway.The only change I made -thanks to all reviews- I made a deep identation in the centre of each scone before baking and filled with jam, there were no jam on my tray after baking ,all in the scone.The glaze covered the jam filling so everybody was in for a nice surprise when taking the first bite out of these delicious treats.

I made these for an office coffee break and they were a big hit. The scones were so flavorful and moist!! Ingredient-wise, I used all of the ingredients except for rose water (can't find here). Because I needed more than 12, I cut these out with a 2" cutter and ended getting 18 scones. I also took another suggestion by indenting the scones and filling the dip with jam. My jam did run out but that was because I didn't make the holes deep enough. Because mine were smaller, I baked for 12-13 minutes instead of the 18. These scones were incredibly easy to make and very scrumptious.

I have to admit I'm not typically a fan of scones but thought I'd make these for the kids on Valentine's Day. These were no better or worse than the average scone I've had. Like the other reviewer said, keep the knife floured, and you won't have any problems getting the jam in.

I loved this recepie. I prepared the scones the da before and refridgerated them. The next day I cut them and put the jam in and glazed them once cooled. They were just gorgeous! Next time I'd like to try them with orange bloosom water and different jams as well.

Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have many problems cutting into my unbaked scones. I kept dipping my SHARP paring knife in flour and that seemed to work fine. I did put parchment on my baking sheet, so the excess jam was easy to clean up. The only change I made was I used lemon oil (1/8 tspn) in lieu of the rose water. I didn't have any on hand and I needed to test the recipe (I'm making them for my sister's baby shower). The glaze was great with lemon! I think this scone recipe is terrific anyway, because the scones were still moist even 2 days later. Terrific!

Made these hearts for VAlentine's day, they ended up more like a cookie, but still good.

These scones were quite a hit. Some came out kind of misshapen, and the texture was a bit biscuit-ish, but the glaze and the raspberry filling made up for it. I found I didn't need nearly the whole cup of cream to make the dough come together -- maybe that was why the texture was like a biscuit? In any case, I'll definitely make these again.

Four forks for taste and two for presentation. mine also bacame all lopsided and the jam seeped out onto the pan. i also had to use more cream than suggested to make the dough. Very yummy though (and sinful!)

I, too, could not cut the scones, so I just created double the amount with half the thickness of each. I thought they were otherwise easy to make and really delicious. All of my family agreed! I also made some of them bite-sized which turned out to be fun!

I would definitely make these again, they were crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. I sifted my dry ingredients well and used organic products. I didn't cut these in half as the recipe suggest, I slit them down the middle on the top and filled the slit with raspberry jam. I glazed them as suggested. I may even try them with apple inside or with strawberry jam and chocolate glaze. I think they can be made with many different toppings and fillings. They are a very versatile treat. I recommend them to everyone who loves scones.

First time making scones and they turned out well. I made these for a Valentines treat and earned a few valintines of my own as a result.

Just made these. Made the same "cutting error" as the other reviewer, and scones ended up lopsided, with the tops sliding off the jam and bottom during baking. I guess you should cut all the way through and then place the top back on? I am disappointed in the presentation, though the taste is great and will try again. Unfortunately, cannot serve to guests, as planned.

Hi Cindij; you'd be better off to make the scones the night before & then re-heat in the AM.

I've never made scones before but a friend says this looks good. Can I make the dough and cut these out a night ahead, then fill with jam in the morning and bake? Thanks to whoever can answer this.

I could see no way to "split" the dough. It was very soft and sticky. I ended up stacking two cut-outs with the jam in between, and they came out great. This recipe made only 6 as compared to 12. Jam inside scone is nice touch.

I failed to mention one thing about the scones - In some specialty food stores is an imported(from Greece)Rose Petal Jam. I use this with chocolate desserts as well and it's almost beyond words! Heat up some of the jam and brush on finished scone for flavor AND scent!

To New Hampshire - I learned from an apple grower in Peterborough to boil down fruit by 1/2 (minus seeds)to make super thick sauce for ANY application, including this. Email me back, let's talk!

This was a great breakfast/tea time treat! They came out fluffy and rich, and the glaze added a nice amount of sweetness and moisture (I also ate the scones without glaze and it was just as good.) The first time I made these, I didn't have raspberry jam so I made half with strawberry preserves and half blueberry preserves. The strawberry was too liquidy and just seeped into the scone and out onto the pan. I have since made them with raspberry preserves and that is much better. In addition, I misunderstood (I think) and cut into the scone starting at one end and cutting all the way so that it was half open...this made it so the scone became lopsided and a lot of the jelly oozed out...I think what they meant was to just cut a slit INTO and all the way through the scone, so that the scone keeps it's shape (maybe that was clear to everyone but me.) Delicious!
