I made this last night and it was EXCEPTIONAL. I pretty much stuck to the recipe with a few exceptions: I used fresh marjoram, not dried, added some fresh thyme as well, and more garlic (about 3 cloves). I also added a splash of dry sherry in addition to the red wine and chicken broth. I served the dish with mashed cauliflower topped with crispy carmelized shallots and roasted asparagus. It was AMAZING!

This was fantastic. A couple of notes I made - I enjoy mushrooms for the taste but not necessarily such big chunks so next time I will chop them up much smaller to make almost a mushroom sauce more so than ragout. I added a couple of large cloves of garlic per other comments. I also used sunflower oil infused with white truffles and added a little less than the 1/4 tsp since other comments seemed to think it was quite strong. It was wonderful. I served the carmelized shallot mashed potatoes (from epicurious) with it and it was fabulous!

I prepared it lastnight as per the recipe, but with shitake mushrooms. It was good but not great. I made it again tonight with baby bella mushrooms, substituted the chicken broth with beef broth and the dry red wine with chardonay...AMAZING. Tastes just like a restaurant I just visted and was trying to find something close. I think I just found it.

My husband loved it. I made the ragout using the crimini mushrooms, but also some rehydrated dried morels. I used salt free chicken boullion base to season the strained morel liquor in place of the stock.

This recipe is amazing! Will have a hard time making any other sauce with filet mignon from now on. My hubby said it was the best sauce I've made with a steak... and I've made a lot. Definitely serve with mashed potatoes, I highly recommend some caramelized shallots on the side or in the potatoes. So delicious!

What an elegant and delicious meal- the whole family thoroughly enjoyed it.

This is so incredibly outstandingly delicious--completely worthy of a special occasion! Yet it is so easy, I would make it on any given weeknight. I followed the instructions to the letter with just one exception: I used 'Herbes de Provence' instead of the marjoram (as marjoram is part of this blend) and I recommend it if you have it!

I made this dish tonight for dinner and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I used 2 cloves of garlic and a combination of shitake, cremini, oyster and button mushrooms. I agree with many of the other reviews about the truffle oil. I tasted the ragout before I drizzled it with the truffle oil and I have to agree that the truffle oil definately adds another dimension to the dish. Don't leave the truffle oil out!! I'll be making this one again.

this was good but not as good as at least one of the other filet recipes on this site. it was easy and relatively quick but just wasn't as special as the port wine and cranberry recipe here.

Made this for Valentine's dinner. We LOVED it! So easy too! My market didn't have crimini, so I used baby bellas, which tasted good. Also, I didn't find pure truffle oil, I bought olive oil infused with truffles, and it still tasted good, I can imagine how great it will be with the real truffle oil.

This was amazing. I would suggest doing two cloves of garlic instead of one. I used a full bodied merlot. I would also suggest a side plate of Gouda cheese slices. FOR SPICY: to add a little heat put a tsp of red pepper flakes when you saute the garlic. it gives it a little kick, but not too much

I made this recipe for Valentine's. Both myself and fiancee were so impressed with how delicious the sauce turned out. Everything was well worth the expense for the filet and the truffles. My brother managed to eat the leftovers with a stake that wasn't quite to par and he said it didn't even come close.

Rating: 4
This worked out nicely. Instead of truffle oil, I shaved some fresh white Oregon truffles over the Mushroom Ragout before serving. Also, I added a little extra cream (actually half and half) at the end of the process to achieve the desired consistency with the sauce. I grilled some strip sirloin steaks over wood charcoal. They were cooked on the rare side of medium. I cut them into half inch strips. I then heated some olive oil and poured it over the sliced steaks to bring them to medium rare. All-in-all, very nice.

Rating: 3
Very good, mild sauce that went well with the filets. I couldn't find any truffle oil, but if I ever come across some, I'd like to try the recipe again with the oil. Even without, the mushroom ragout was delish. Served it with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
Holy cow! This recipe is exceptional! I put it on top of risotto con parmigiano-reggiano (found on this site) and they were perfect together. The risotto sucks up some of the ragout and the flavor together is fabulous. Do not leave out the truffle oil. Although it is good without it, the oil ads that spike of flavor that puts the recipe over the top. Felt like we were eating at a 5 star restaurant. Soooo good!

I honestly have not tried this recipe. It does sound good but!!! Truffle Oil??? Come on.. Bon Appetit..you know better. There is no such thing as Truffle Oil. It is olive oil with other SYNTHETIC ingredients added to it. No truffles.Truffle Oil is a big scam with a big price tag. For those of you who doubt , check it out on the web.Im sure this recipe would be just fine without the "Truffle Oil"!

This dish is, in a word, absolutely euphoric! I have prepared it many times to rave reviews with the recipe as written, don't substitute or use an inferior piece of meat. It is especially a treat with the lobster mash potato recipe on this site. I have had this with merlots as well as cab's, and have found the latter a bit heavy for this dish.

This was delicious recipe- however I couldn't find truffle oil in the middle of a snowstorm so I omitted that. Sauce was very good anyway.

Rating: 4
Oh, mama, what a dinner! I must preface this by saying I did not use tenderloin (only because the stores were all sold out of filet mignon the night before Valentine's Day), so I used ribeyes instead, and as I couldn't countenance frying ribeyes in a pan, I grilled them (in the middle of a snowstorm!). I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter, however, and I can say that this is just stupendous eating. I made the lobster mashed potatoes too, and was so intoxicated by the whole smell of the mushroom wine sauce and truffle oil that I put truffle oil on the potatoes, too (what the hell). Nothing like gilding your lily! This is an amazing dish. I'd give it 10 forks if I could.

We also made this last night for Valentine's Day--the steaks cooked surprisingly well on the stovetop and the mushrooms were delicious. I used a mix of exotic mushrooms and they were wonderful with the truffle oil--definitely splurge on it, it's worth it!

My wife and I prepared this for our V-day dinner this year and the mushroom ragout is my new favorite mushroom sauce. I'm not a big fan of sauces on steaks, but this one complements perfectly. It was also our first foray into the world of truffle oil which may prove addictive.

Great recipe. Don't skip the truffle oil, it's the main idea here. I used another nice trick - I cut a "pocket" in the fillet, started it on a pan to seal it, stuffed the pocket with shavings of black truffle and finished it in the oven. Amazing.

Fabulous dish as is. Please don't skip the Truffle Oil! It is an essential component to this dish. During dinner, I ate one little mushroom that I unwittingly omitted from the anointment with Truffle oil. I missed the seductive flavor in which only Truffle Oil can impart in that one bite! Relish it! Savor it! I served it with roasted potato slices topped with creme fraiche and caviar and a plum tomato and fresh mozzarella salad with capers in a balsamic vinagrette. Also, I typically do not drink Merlot, but we opened a wonderful '97 Napa Valley Merlot and it really was a great match.

I am a very unexperienced cook. I found this recipe and decided to try it out. I was amazed at how wonderful it turned out. I have sinced used this recipe five times!

Made this dish for my boyfriend, who travels and dines out extensively. He thought it was the best fillet he's ever eaten. The mushrooms are simply to die for! Made with the rosemary potatoes and asparagus. All went together without a great deal of time or exhersion. Very nervous about cooking a fillet stovetop. Was a 3" thick fillet, so after cooking on the stove, popped in the oven with the potatoes for 5 minutes. Used portabella and button mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe verbatum. Turned out beautifully.

If I could give this a "five fork" rating, I would! This was incredible, honestly the best thing I've ever cooked, and possibly ever tasted! I made it on Valentine's day and served it with roasted red potatoes and creamed spinach. It made for a beautiful presentation. I ended up using shiitake mushrooms along with button mushrooms. I think next time, I will put more shiitake since they have so much more flavor. The steaks were cooked to perfection, I followed the instructions to the letter and was so happy with the results, as was my husband!

Rating: 4
Made this for a Valentines dinner and it was a smash. The sauce is so flavorful and with the added truffle oil, it's simply delish. For such a simple recipe, it's a great dish to serve since you can make the sauce ahead of time and the steaks do not take very long - just remember not to overcook because they still cook when you let the filets sit for awhile before you serve them. If you are doing this in mass you can also set the oven to a very high temp, like 425 and place the filets on a tray lightly coated with the peanut oil.

Truly a divine dish for a special occasion. I used 6 different wild mushrooms-- including lots of black trumpets which I love-- and thought the variety really added to the complexity of the dish.

Made this for V-day...VERY good. Made the ragout a few hours ahead of time and reheated when filets were cooking---the only thing i'd change would be not making it ahead of time. Still was awesome though. And a little truffle oil goes a looong way. Mmmm...definitely romantic for Valentine's day!

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, and he loved it! I think it is the first time in the three years I've been cooking for him that he exclaimed "Mmmm" on the first bite. Although he didn't like the mushrooms, I will cook with them again for the flavor, but leave them out of the finished product. I couldn't find a filet mignon, (supermarket strike here in So Cal) so I bought a porterhouse steak and cooked it in the sauce at the very end for a while to sear in the juices. A definite keeper!

Seriously, this filet mignon/mushroom combo is amazing! I wish I had made double the amount of the mushroom ragout. My husband usually doesn't like "ruining the pure flavor of the meat" and he even wiped the pan the sauce was cooked in with his last piece of meat because he loved it so much. The BEST mushrooms we've ever had. I didn't use the Truffle Oil either, the store was sold out of it and it was great. I'll make this at least once a month!

Do not be stingy with the truffle oil. It makes the dish 4 forks. I also steeped the mushroom stems in the broth for about 20 minutes while the mushrooms were cooking to get more flavor. Started the filets in a iron skillet, then transferred to quick 375 oven to finish them off. Buy the meat from a quality butcher and you can't go wrong.

This is definitely the recipe to show just how much of an epicurious diva you are. Just be careful when using salt. When seasoning the steaks, only use 1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper on each filet. The truffle oil and reduced sodium broth is sufficient enough. The truffle oil really does add a nice touch. The mushrooms will melt in your mouth (However, my husband simply inhales them). An inexpensive cabernet is ideal as opposed to cooking wine. Might as well sip the remainder with brie & crackers as an appetizer. Enjoy & Happy Valentine's!

This is just a response to Waldorf MD regarding wine. I, too, am NOT a wine expert, but I do know that cooking wines tend to have salt added to them. I would avoid it and just use a bit of the wine you intend to serve with dinner. (assuming you drink wine with dinner that is...) If not, then admit your ignorance at a local wine shop and ask them to recommend an inexpensive wine to go with this dish. If its a shop worth your time (and potential money) they will give you a decent recommendation. Good luck. I will be making this for a post-valentine dinner!

I Made exactly as written, and we didn't care for the mushrooms, althought the steaks were good. Overall, We prefer the filets with merlot sauce, also on this site, which I usually make with mushrooms also. Somehow the flavors or red wine and beef which conpliment each other so nicely seemed to get lost in this combination.

First let me say I use the 4 fork rating sparingly-I don't toss it around. The mushroom side was incredible and paired with filet mignon was to die for...skipped the truffle oil (too lazy to go and get it) so I can't even imagine what it would have done for this already tasty dish. I feel almost 'food drunk' from this-will make again & again.

My husband made this for Valentine's but I watched over his shoulder just in case. (He's great with scrambled eggs.) Also had the mashed potatoes which were knock-out. I agree that grilling tjhe steaks would be a nice option, but would hate to give up the great brown stuff from the skillet that enriches the sauce. (Not like you're saving washing a pan . . . ) I also wonder if using half-and-half is why the sauce didn't reduce quickly enough fro some people. It is practically dish water, while heavy cream is thick and rich. Just a thought.

This WAS delicious but not a 'dish beyond compare'. I also grilled the steaks which worked out great. Next time I will thick slice the mushrooms instead of quartering them. I had the heat on med-low and the liquid in the ragout almost disappeared. The truffle oil that I bought at a gourmet foods store ($7 for 2 oz) was 'truffle infused olive oil'. They told me at 2 places that's what you buy?? What did the rest of you buy? I served the filets with Tomatoes and Feta Cheese with Herb & Garlic Dressing from this site and Oven Roasted Potatoes from The California Cook cookbook. Wonderful dinner.

YUMMY! We grilled the steaks instead of pan frying them. This is the first time I used truffle oil and it was quite delicious. I'm sure it would still taste great without it, too. I used half and half (10% cream)instead of the whipping cream and it was fine. The boyfriend loved it!

The mushroom ragout was delicious. I couldn't get cremini so I used baby bellas and button. The sauce needs to simmer longer than indicated. My husband isn't crazy about mushrooms but after one bite delcared it great. Be sure to use UNSALTED broth, I didn't have it and it was a bit too salty. If you don't have unsalted be sure to salt lightly where indicated.
