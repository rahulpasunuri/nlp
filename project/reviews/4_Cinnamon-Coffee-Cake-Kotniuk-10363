I'm a huge fan of this recipe and have made it multiple times for guests. Very flavorful, and has a nice airyness to it. I add an apple, but otherwise keep the recipe the same.

In my infinite wisdom, I pulled it out of the oven 10 minutes early because I thought it was getting too dry. Big mistake. The center collapsed. However, it was still delicious and very, very moist. Making it again tomorrow for an event and will actually follow the recipe on cooking time.

Zowie, is this cake sweet. I put 3/4 cup sugar in the cake instead of 1 cup and I didnt use the entire 2/3 cup sugar topping and it was still waay sweet. I put raisins in which was a mistake; more sweetness. If I had had nuts, that would have been a better choice. Used a generous tablespoon of cinnamon in the topping, although I ended up not using all of it. The cake rose and kept its shape, didn´t fall and wasn ´t swaybacked, which is a plus. It formed a carapace of sugar and looked done way before it was. I broke through the sugar crust after about 40 mins and the cake was still liquid. When done, it was moist, with a good texture. I used the sandwich method to marble, but it didn´t... came out with a darker layer on bottom and a lighter cake layer on top. Ok cake, but if I did it again I would further reduce the sugar and add apples and nuts or some other variation... cranberries?

Read all the reviews and then did my thing. Added I Tbsp Grand Marnier and the zest of one navel orange to the batter, omitting the vanilla snd upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp and added chp pecans and chocolate chips to the cinnamon.sugar mixture. Since it was not a large batter, I oppted to use a 9 inch springform pan which was perfect. A ten inch pam would have produced a flatter and much less impressive cake.Did 1/2 the batter. 1/2 the cinnamon/sugar.nuts and chips, Dolloped on the remaining batter and used the back of a spoon dipped in cold water to smooth the batter. Ran a knife blade through to marble and baked for 50 minutes... a perfect cake which came out of the pan like a dream and looked beautiful.The only problem is that I can't stop eating it. Will play with other variations. T am hard to please, but this recipe sure did!!

To further answer junekarbow's query about double-acting baking powder, this refers to the powder creating those oh-so-necessary gas bubbles when in the presence of liquid and then heat. I didn't have sour cream so used vanilla yogourt and still got an airy result. I also added too much sugar to the butter and quickly had 1 1/2 times the recipe. This filled a 9x13 pan. Will experiment with berries next time.

Rating: 3
This was my first attempt at a coffee cake using a new springform pan, and the result was moist, fluffy and golden. However, even after reducing the sugar quite a bit, it was still WAY too sweet for my taste, and next time I think I will reduce the sugar by at least one-half, possibly more if I am adding sweet fruit or raisins. Other than that, a great basic coffee cake recipe.

Rating: 4
Easy and forgiving recipe that produces a light, fluffy and moist coffee cake! Some modifications: used light sour cream, reduced sugar in batter to 3/4 cup, increased vanilla to 1.5 tsp, and increased cinnamon to 2 tsp - all with great results! some notes for those making this for the first time: the batter is relatively thick so swirling can be difficult; the sandwich method mentioned by the other reviewers is definitely the way to go! also, when the baking soda reacts with the sour cream, it will foam up - this is completely normal, just make sure you have some room to contain the foam; I mixed them in a one cup measuring cup and it overflowed a little bit.

Rating: 4
Great coffee cake recipe! I used a 9" spring form pan and as others suggested, sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar in the middle and on top, draging a knife through to swirl. I sprinkled chopped pecans on the top and then the rest of the sugar, and swirled it. The result was like having a candied pecan toppint. Yum!

Okay -- I'm back again to rectify my original review of this recipe-- having made it once more since the first time (the bf and my Mom both LOVED it, so I had to re-make it to give it a second chance and see what all the fuss was about), I can say that it IS a great coffee cake recipe, and it'll be a staple in our breakfast rotation. The second time 'round, I added 2 diced apples sauteed in butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, and mixed them in along with the original filling, and spread that between layers of cake. To the cake itself, I added 1/8 tsp of almond extract, and topped the cake off with a crumbly mixture of butter, flour and sugar. Heavenly. Which is probably why it inspired so much nagging guilt regarding my first review of it... ;-)

Rating: 2
I really had high hopes for this one...especially after assembling the batter and seeing its light, fluffy consistency, and even moreso after tasting a spoonfull of it. The end result was actually just so-so; all the flavor that was present in the batter was reduced probably by half in the baked cake. The texture was extremely light and fluffy -- it wasn't gummy by any means, but it wasn't cake-like either. The swirled brown sugar cinnamon on top created a very thin, crispy sugary crust which cracked upon slicing and biting, which was nice. Overall, a puff of ethereal coffee cake with a muted cinnamon flavor. Eh.

Help!!! These tasted great, BUT I made them twice today, and they collapsed both times. I adjusted for altitude (added a tablespoon of water, a tablespoon of flour, and subtracted a tablespoon of sugar) The first time I doubled the recipe, and figured the collapse was due to a ratio problem with baking powder and baking soda being out of proportion. But made again the second time, seperately, and had the same results. Does anyone know how I can correct this?

This is a delicious and very forgiving recipe, so I give it 4. I misread the recipe and only used 1/2 the butter called for and it still turned out well. The cardamom is a lovely addition...I added one more tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp cardamom plus pecans and layered as suggested by previous cooks. Super-easy.

This is really yummy. Being genetically incapable of following a recipe without fiddling, I made a few changes. I used whole-wheat pastry flour, light sour cream, applesauce in place of half the butter, and a bit less sugar in the cake. I also folded in a chopped apple and baked it in an 8" square cake pan.

0 Forks. Followed recipe exactly. This cake tastes weird, and gross. There's a funky aftertaste, and the parts where the brown sugar was "swirled" have the consistency of raw batter. I baked it for 50 minutes, and the rest of the cake is cooked. Very disappointed. I may have done something wrong, but I did follow the recipe carefully.

I used my Thanksgiving cranberry sauce and whipped cream (instead of sour cream) to make little muffins. Sprinkled walnuts over batter in tins then a heaping spoon of cranberry sauce, sprinkled w/cinnamon, ground clove and some brown sugar. Baked about 13 minutes. Tasty little treats!

Wow this was a wonderful coffee cake. I've started making a coffee cake every Sunday night and my husband has it in the mornings for breakfast. I've experimented with different coffee cake recipes and this one has been the best, for sure. The cake has a really nice moist cakey crumb. The only thing I would adjust for us personally is to maybe cut the sugar slightly, because we just have a little less of a sweet-tooth than the average person.

Fantastic coffee cake. My husband's response was "this is the best coffee cake EVER!" Both kids loved it. Used 1/2 of turbinado sugar in the batter and 1 C of greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Next time I am going to add diced apples to the sugar mixture. Definitely put the sugar mixture between two layer of this thick batter. Fabulous!!

I made the recipe as written and was as happy as everybody else with the results. But it reminded me of a Rhubarb Bundt Cake that I made years ago from the Minnesota Heritage Cookbook available from the American Cancer Society, which was printed in the newspaper. Same type batter, but the filling was 10 oz rhubarb, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tb sugar mixed together. You spoon the batter into the pan by thirds, and sprinkle half the filling between each layer, ending with batter. The rhubarb gave a jolt of tartness amidst the sweetness of the cake. Im going to try it this way next time.

I doubled this recipe to make for a large group. Baked for close to 75 min (which felt really long) to get a clean toothpick from the middle. Edges were a little well done but it was moist throughout the rest of the cake. With the sugar sprinked on top, it looked "darker" than I anticipated. I covered with foil after 45 min. Used a 10x13 glass dish. Added 2 tsp of cardamom, 1 extra tsp of cinnamon, and 2 cups of chopped walnuts. I struggled to "swirl" it so the sugar mix ended up more blended into the batter and then sprinked on top, but all rave reviews. It got gobbled up quickly and everyone was asking what the spices were. I would make again. Good for brunch or with coffee. Not too sweet.

Rating: 4
Although I doubled this recipe, I pretty much followed the recipe except I added pecans which gave it a really nice flavor and instead of putting the entire sugar and cinnamon mixture on top I poured in half the batter then sprinkled and swirled 1/2 the sugar mixture and then put the remaining batter and topped that with the rest of the sugar mixture and swirled again. Everyone loved it, I will definitely be making this again. With doubling the recipe it also took about 20 minutes longer to cook. At the 45 minute mark I covered the top with foil so it wouldn't burn.

Do NOT make this recipe in muffin tins like I did. The topping went directly to the bottom and stuck, and we couldn't get the muffins out. Also, the topping was a little too sweet. I did add pecans, and that was the best part. I may try this again in a cake pan, but I will SWIRL otherwise all the stuff will sink to the bottom.

I read the other reviews and saw ahead of time that layering the "topping" would work out better than swirling. The batter was too think to do that, so I ended up mixing it all together in the bundt pan. It worked out well, despite that. I put a bit of the "topping" in the pan first, then the batter. I also added a bit of cinnamon, ground cloves, and ground ginger to the batter. It was delicious! Great made-from-scratch coffee cake!

I wanted a mildly spiced, comforting, easy cake, and this filled the bill. To make it even easier, I didn't bother with the separate cinnamon sugar mixture. I mixed the spices in with the batter directly. I also fiddled with the ingredients becos of dietary constraints. I substituted 2 cups of wholewheat pastry flour and 4 tspns of baking powder. Added 1/2 tspn of ground clove,a dash of ginger and 2 tspns lemon peel. Cut the sugar to 1 cup (used brown only), added walnuts and 1/2 cup of canola oil instead of butter, and baked it for 45 mins. My worries about how it'd turn out were unfounded; the cake was mildly spiced and yummy eaten warm with a glass of milk.

I have made this recipe several times was great success. I also bake the cake in a 10 in. springform pan, cool and then top with powdered sugar.

I've probably made this coffee cake a hundred times and it couldn't be easier. I add a cup of chopped pecans to the topping. The nuts help cut the sweetness of the cake. I like to put it in the oven while I'm getting ready for work so I can take it to work still warm from the oven.

This is simply a wonderful recipe and has been one of my standards over the last three years. It never fails to draw raves. I use a springform plan and usually double the recipe. At times, depending on my mood, I also increase the sugar/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture amounts. It tastes as if you slaved in the kitchen for hours, when the only significant time investment is cleaning up all those bowls.

I loved the way this came out!!I used a springform pan; made one layer of batter, sprinkled filling and walnuts(I need walnuts in coffee cake); then added the rest of the batter, topped with filling and walnuts and swirled just a little. It tasted so good and was very beautiful! Everyone I shared it with LOVED it! I will make this again and again.

This is a terrific coffee cake that can be used for company as well as for a family weekend breakfast treat. I made it mostly according to the recipe, with some additions: To the batter I added orange zest from one orange and about 2 teaspoons of Grand Marnier. To the topping, I added 2 big handfuls of chopped pecans and 1/2 package of dried blueberries that had been soaked in orange juice. (I drained the juice before adding the blueberries.) As noted by other reviewers, the batter was thick and fluffy, and had to be spread in the pan rather than poured. Due to batter consistency as well as the additions to the topping, I layered the crumbly topping between two layers of batter. The cake baked beautifully even with all the additions. Cooks note: the eggs were at room temperature before beating them into the batter. I also used the only flour I had on hand, which was bread flour. These factors may have contributed to the spreadable vs. pourable batter. Also, when preparing the pan, I lined the bottom with parchment paper, which seemed to help in removing the pan.

I thought this was a great basic coffee cake recipe. I made it exactly as printed, and it turned out great. I did use a 9 in springform pan, which made it much easier to get out of the pan (it's pretty fragile). I think that next time I will add some chopped pecans or walnuts and a little butter to the topping for more flavor though.

Doesn't get 4 forks because it's not particularly creative. If, however, you're looking for a good, easy, quick coffee cake - this is the one. I added walnuts - the added crunch and flavor were good. As far as the swirl/layer discussion - I really don't think it matters. If your batter is thin enough, swirl away. Otherwise, glob half the batter into the dish, mush the streusel into it, glob the rest of the batter on, and then add the rest of the streusel. This is pretty much a can't miss recipe. Also - I used light sour cream to no apparent detriment, and skipped the vanilla because I was out of it. (The vanilla, not my mind...)

Easy to make (other than cleaning the myriad of bowls) and delicious to serve. The cake expands a lot while baking.

I'm biased because I love cinnamon, but this coffee cake was great! I'm not sure I made it right - the batter was really, really thick, so I couldn't pour it into the pan, I just spooned big globs of it in. Because of that, I also had a hard time "swirling" in the cinnamon mixture (also, there's a lot of of the mixture, but it's so good, you shouldn't skimp!). If you can put in half the batter and then half the cinnamon, and then repeat, as other people have suggested, that would be a good idea - but it didn't seem practical, given how stiff my batter was. I sort of swirled, sort of stirred my cinnamon in, but the outcome was delicious!

Rating: 3
Wow! I needed to use up some sour cream and never dreamed how delicious this recipe would be! I think the trick is to cream the butter well. I ended up with a hugely fluffy batter. I read the previous recipes and was torn between swirling vs. making a separate cinnamon layer vs. evenly mixing the cinnamon throughout the batter. In the end, I think my batter would have supported the swirl (I tried to fold in the cinnamon before I "poured" the batter, which in the end disturbed the swirl when I was dolloping everything in the pan). Delicious!

Rating: 4
This was great and I'm adding it to my regulars. I'm not a big baker and this was very easy. Next time I will double the recipe and add walnuts to the cinnamon mixture. As another person mentioned, the cinnamon mixture doesnt exactly "swirl", so I half the batter in the pan, add the cinnamon stuff, then add the rest of the batter on top. I made it in a bundt pan which was a bit big for this recipe but still worked out okay. My guests were very favourable.

This is a great recipe. We made this about 3 times and found that baking in a 9" springform works the best. Chopped pecans are a good addition and pressing them gently into batter keeps them from rolling to middle when cake rises.

This was the best cake I've ever made! I used a springform pan which worked out really well. I didn't cut down on the amount of sugar called for, and even though I usually don't like very sweet desserts, this was perfect. The cinnamon-sugar topping doesn't really swirl through the cake; I just stirred it into all the batter. I'll be making this again!

I used to work in a bakery and have earned a reputation for bringing outstanding desserts to parties- this one was an embarassment. It had a bland taste and lacked the textured crumb topping that makes coffee cake so good. For the first time ever, no one offered to take home the leftovers. My advice: don't bother with this recipe!

We served this for an impromptu brunch and it was wonderful. It came together fairly quickly and was moist and delicious.

THis was a great coffee cake. Moist sweet not too sweet and crumbly. I used spelt flour instead of normal flour (more fiber and protein, but increased by 1/2 cup) Also had to use lowfat yogurt-no sour cream. It came great. REally yummy...my husband like. Very easy to do.

This was delicious. It was nice and moist inside with a slightly crunchy exterior. I used a 10-inch springform pan and used the technique in the directions. I simply spread the batter in the pan, spooned the topping on, and then ran a butter knife through the dough to swirl it. It has kept well too. I baked it on Monday, and we'll finish it today (Wednesday) with no discernible change in quality. I think this cake would freeze well for the person who wanted to make it ahead of time.

Easy and delicious. I used a 2 quart glass casserole dish and lowered oven temp to 325 for 45 min. Came out perfectly golden on outside, moist and light on the inside.

My husband said he was going to finish the whole pan. You cannot "pour" this mixture into the pan, you have to spread it. It's very thick, which made the swirling quite difficult. Now that I know how it turned out, next time I will try to spread half the batter, sprinkle half the cinnamon-sugar over it, spread the rest of the batter on that (which might be difficult) and then sprinkle the other half on top of that. Having some on top made such a nice, crunchy crust. I'm also going to put chopped pecans on top, and I might cut the sugar in the cake by just a teeny bit because it was almost a little too sweet with the extra cinnamon-sugar.

This recipe is excellent! A perfect "night before" recipe for a special breakfast. It is delicious, moist and has the added bonus of being very easy to make with minimum muss/fuss. I almost messed up and added the soda and powder to the flour--I'm glad I started over. I know it shows ignorance on my part, but I've never added baking soda to sour cream and had it puff up like this before--it was fascinating!

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and did not swirl the topping, just put it on--BIG MISTAKE! The topping was not integrated into the cake and 1/4 of the sugar just fell off and tasted awful. The cake was super moist and delicious and it would have been a total masterpiece if I had swirled it the sugar. I did reduce the sugar in topping to 1/4 of each and there was still so much. also used light sour cream and beat everything with a mixer. Used a regular cake pan sprayed w/ cooking spray instead of greasing w/ butter which I always find makes things slip out much better than butter, which it did with no problem. However, if you have a springform pan, that would work well, but not necessary. Can't wait to make this again.

Wonderful recipe for a moist coffee cake. I made it in a 9-inch springform pan and baked for 55 minutes. For the topping, I followed another cook's advice and cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup.

I've made this twice, and both times thought I had enough sour cream and didn't. I substitute apple sauce, using a smidge less than the amount called for because of the extra moistness of the apple sauce. I also didn't have a cake pan and used a pie plate instead. Worked okay, but did spill over a bit. Very delish cake... Great for a weekend morning.

This is easy and terrific; I wouldn't change anything. The cinnamon swirl, in spots where it didn't swirl, made for a crusty sweet cinnamon topping.

Everyone's idea of the perfect coffee cake seems to be different in our house but I have found that this coffee cake pleases everyone. It is very moist and tender and it is the only recipe I have tried that is gone almost immediately. Thank you Stephanie and Epicurious!!!

Moist is right! I baked this for a co-worker's birthday. It was a BIG hit at work! People wanted the recipe and it was gone fast. I wasn't sure about my technique of "swirling the sugar mixture into the batter", but it came out wonderfully! Very easy to make too -- my husband was disappointed I didn't bake two!

This is one of those super easy recipes that makes everybody happy. I threw it together Easter morning as a last minute treat and we couldn't get enough of it. Even better on the second day. Might be even better with just a little less sugar--the white sugar in particular is a little distracting from the cinnamon goodness.

Very easy to do and still so moist the next day!

This was rather easy and a big hit. I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon in the batter. I would definitely make it again.

Easy to prepare. Moist (without being greasy), tender texture. I have made this as part of a brunch buffet and everyone enjoyed it, though some thought it was a bit too sweet. I would definitely make this again.

I made this for our work donut day, using plain skim yogourt and got rave reviews, it is so moist!

Excellent coffee cake, very moist & tasty. I didn't have any sour cream in the house so I used a non-fat vanilla yogurt. Can't wait to make it again. My family of 4 polished it off in one day!
