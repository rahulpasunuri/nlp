Fabulous. Made it with extra onions.

Delicious!! Everyone raved! I added more onions and did the carmelizing on the stovetop rather than in the oven.

I've made this tart twice to absolutely rave reviews. I added more onions as we couldn't get enough!

Made it as a light supper, my wife and I scarfed the whole thing! Recipe called for just barely enough onions, could see making a bit more.

Delish! Everyone raved about this tart and you can never have enough onions!

I could have eaten this entire tart by myself. It was sweet and savory at the same time. Instead of using crème fraîche, I used the sour cream that I already had on hand. I also increased the amount of onions I used (maybe 2 lbs? I didn't measure it precisely).

I served this as an appetizer for Easter dinner, it was a big hit and I plan to make it again for Mother's Day (I really loved it). The onions probably took almost 3 hours to caramelize, be sure to allow enough time.

Absolutely delicious, I agree make more onions, we were picking them off the tart:)

This was delicious. Since creme fraiche was not availbale at the Publix stores I made it using equal parts of heavy whipping cream and sour cream. Allow this to set on counter covered for at least 12 hours. It was an acceptable substitute. Guests raved and licked the platter clean. Must do again

Fabulous!!! We had to stop ourselves or would have finished the whole thing. Made the recipe as is and served w white wine and a big salad. Roasting onions takes time but is oh so worst it. Maybe a bit less intensive to do it on the stove. I will try that next time. The fresh time is the magical ingredient... I may try it w something lighter than crème fraîche next time. Sour cream maybe?

Made this exactly as written and it was excellent! A mandolin made the onion slicing so easy I beat the prep time by a mile. Only change I'd recommend is using more onions and I think roasting them is better for the honey glaze...

This was good, but it's unclear when roasting the onions if the time is 30 min.TOTAL or 30 min. PLUS plus 30-45 more. I had to carmelize mine on top of the stove to get them done in time.(We are at 7,000 feet, however.) It made more than 6 servings for apps, just cut them smaller.

This was quite good--and easy. Maybe 'cause I'm such a slow chopper, I never come close to their "active time"--but this one was under an hour. I doubled the bacon and added a half pound of asparagus to the onions, and it still could have used more stuff. Next time I wouldn't bother roasting the veggies, but rather saute them. The crust held up nicely.

This is a great recipe, quick, painless, and makes a great presentation to take to a dinner party. I make a vegetarian version of this that I found years ago. No Bacon, no honey, red onions instead of yellow, and balsamic vinegar instead of wine. Keep the thyme, and top with goat cheese instead of creme fraiche. Just a different twist on this recipe. I t would be great to make both kinds for variety!

This was an absolute hit! It is great for a winter's night dinner with soup or I could envision having it for a brunch or even a luncheon. Caramelizing the onions in the oven did take some time but well worth the effort. I think you could make the entire tart hours, if not a day before, cover and refrigerate and then bake. Enjoy!

First of all, this recipe was included in a section of the magazine entitled, "Weeknight Cooking", yet the prep/cook time was 1 hour and 40 minutes. Yikes! If I ever make this recipe again, I will definitely caramelize the onions on the cooktop in a saute pan rather than going to all the trouble of doing it in the oven for 45 minutes! This recipe was waaaaaay too labor intensive for an "average" result.
