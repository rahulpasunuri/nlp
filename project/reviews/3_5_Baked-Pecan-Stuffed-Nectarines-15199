wonderful recipe. so easy to make. i used brown sugar which made the dish seem richer. it is difficult to find desserts that match well with a french sauterene. leave out the icecream. it is a perfect match with the sweet wine.

I prepared this dish with walnuts as pecans are very difficult to find in France. I also cooked it in my Weber BBQ. I left them in a little longer and my guests were thrilled. It was perfect because after the "food" was grilled, I stuck the fruit into the Weber, closed it up and removed them just in time for dessert without having to run back to the kitchen from outside.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always well received. It's the perfect end to a light summer meal. It tastes like a cobbler without the fattening pastry.

I, too, made this dish without the egg and with the addition of butter for binding. I also left out the sprinkling of 1/2 tsp sugar, but that was because I forgot. The dish came out wonderfully and and without the additional sugar, made a wonderful breakfast dish.

Ditch the egg yolk--made this with and without it and never missed it; you can add a tbsp or two of melted butter for binding, if you want, and make sure to use dark brown sugar for the best flavor. This is a truly perfect dish, simple, attractive, and delicious, but make CERTAIN your nectarines are juicy and ripe--baking them will soften them, but can't add the ripe-fruit flavor. This, served with homemade nectarine ice cream, is a truly heavenly summer dessert. Add a simple caramel sauce (I like Better Homes & Gardens' microwave version) and extra pecans and you have the best ice cream sundae in the world.

Easy to make and very tasty. Needed something else in addition to ice cream to round out the plate so I added a petite sweet bun.
