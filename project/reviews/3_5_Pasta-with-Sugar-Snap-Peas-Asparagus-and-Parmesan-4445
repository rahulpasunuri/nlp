This is one of my favourite springtime recipes. I love it with salmon. Very fresh and light. I have been making this since it was originally printed in 1992.

Excellent. Like all recipes, I don't always use the same measurements "suggested" in the recipe. Use fresh ingredients and a good quality pasts.

Fresh peas from the garden + fresh asparagus? A delicious taste of spring/early summer! I followed the recipe except I warmed the olive oil with probably 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes while cooking the veggies/pasta. Served 2 as main dish with salad, and plenty of leftovers for a great lunch tomorrow!

Very nice spring side dish. I loaded up on the asparagus and pea pods and used less of the bowties. It was great with grilled steelhead trout. Next time will play with seasoning by adding some garlic and/or red pepper flakes for a little more pizazz.

Another Bon APpetit recipe I have made many times. Initially I followed the recipe as written and it was great. I have varied the vegetables depending on the season to include proccoli, peas, green beans almost anything green which can be cooked tender crisp. I have also used roasted garlic olive oil. A wonderful recipe which you can have fun with.

A very tasty accompaniment to my baked halibut! I followed the recipe exactly, using sugar smap peas. Note to myself...next time add a few fresh or frozen green peas to add additional color and texture.

I found this dish to be really bland. Neither my husband nor I were impressed. I did add a little lemon juice after eating a little bit of it for a little zip. That helped, but not worth it to make again.

Really good. I skipped asparagus and did a combination of sugar snap peas and shelled peas. I also sauteed crushed garlic in the olive oil. Definitely use grated cheese, not shredded, which just clumps.

I used fresh peas from the garden, omitted the asperagus and added a little goat cheese and roated peppers. Excellent - healthy - fast. Great meal for anytime!

I infused the oil with garlic and red pepper flakes before adding to the pasta veg mixture. My veggies turned out perfectly. I just boiled the asparagus for 2 minutes and transferred to a bowl of ice water, then drained into a colander. I didn't add them back to the boiling water, I just drained the pasta and peas right over them in the same colander. Turned out really perfect. You may need more cheese than is called for. My husband and I ate the whole thing in one night for a nice veggie dinner. It was great.

Perfect side dish for a summer meal. And so easy. The sugar snap peas and parmesan cheese really make the dish

One of my old standbys. I've been making this dish since 1992! In fact, the whole meal that was featured in Bon Appetit (salmon, tiramisu) was terrific.

A good, easy recipe that takes advantage of the fresh flavors of the vegetables. I garnished with fresh chives.

Nice fresh, seasonal dish and easy to prepare in under 20 minutes, but why not add a handful of chopped fresh herbs for interest? Basil, chive and certainly parsley would go well here. Also, why not tossed in finely diced red bell pepper for a little color. Dont forget salt and freshly ground pepper. Finally, if you insist on making this dish in one pot, stress the importance of draining very well.The Pasta/vegetables should be very dry before being added to the oil mixture; its the difference between a glossy sheen and a soggy mess.
