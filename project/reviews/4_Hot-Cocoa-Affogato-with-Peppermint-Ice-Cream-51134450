This was a hit for a Christmas dinner. Rich, warm, and very tasty. Saving this for future cold weather desserts.

This was one of several desserts I prepped for Christmas. It was great because it was easily prepared a day ahead and was quickly assembled on Christmas. It looks great, is delicious and was quite a hit with kids and adults. Because the cocoa is warm, rich and chocolatey and vanilla-y and the peppermint ice cream is cool and minty, this one dish captures a great array of the kind of characteristics many of us look for in holiday treats.

Luscious! A keeper! But the proper name should be Peppermint Ice Cream Affogato with Hot-Cocoa... affogato means drowned in Italian... it's the ice cream that's being "drowned" by the hot cocoa, and not the other way around...

Decadent. I make it nightly for my teenager now. So easy to just eye the ingredients. 3:1 ratio of milk to cream, a dash of espresso and unsweetened cocoa (a nice quality cocoa), handful of chocolate chips, mix enough sugar to taste. Remove from heat and add a dash of Mexican vanilla. We've used it over several different ice creams.
