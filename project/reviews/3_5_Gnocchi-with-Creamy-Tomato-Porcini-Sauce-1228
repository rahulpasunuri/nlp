made this recipe just as written but did add some fresh shitakes along with the porcinis and I made my own marinara. Will definitely make again. Simple but would serve to dinner guests.

Delicious comfort food (even though I used tomatoes in my marinara that had celery and "spices" by mistake). And sooo easy! Leftovers were great with orecchiette pasta.

Very delicious recipe. It is the perfect dead-of-winter comfort food - a little more refined than my usual (scrumptious) homemade tomato sauce, but heavier, as well. Nice enough to serve for company but easy enough to do on a weeknight.

Easy and very good. I chose this recipe b/c I was making homemade gnocchi for the first time and wanted a super simple sauce that would be more special than pouring it straight out of a jar. This definitely fit the bill. I used Rao's Homemade marinara sauce - expensive, but worth it.

This was such an easy recipe to execute and so simple to make--I followed it to the letter, though I used my own marinara as I keep it on hand and didn't need to get store bought. I put this over some whole wheat gnocchi and served it with some warm garlic bread and red wine and it was hard to stop eating it! One thing I would recommend with the porcini mushrooms--either make your own stock with stems and water or add an additional cup of water to the reserved liquid to dilute it down. It was a VERY strong flavor of the porcini mushrooms and overwhelmed the dish itself. Next time I make this I will probably just make my own stock and it will be perfect!

This sauce is very delicious and incredibly simple. Ill definitely be making this one again. I used homemade ricotta gnocchi, which was good but next time Ill try potato. I agree with previous reviewers on making your own marinara. The taste of fresh sauce is too good to pass on when it is so quick and easy. Large can of tomatoes, few crushed cloves of garlic, half an onion, with some of the extra porcinis cooked for about half an hour with some left over poultry herbs I had lying around bound with cooking twine. Great recipe.

This is the most spectacular sauce for pasta, made my own gnocchi, cooked it for my son who also happens to be a good cook, he was amased. Can't wait to do it again for friends

Very nice. Followed some of the reviews here and made my own tomato sauce by sauteing onions and garlic in the butter, then adding soaked mushrooms, then fire roased crushed tomatoes, mushroom broth, and cream. Sprinked asiago over the top. Nice, quick, and wonderfully rich with only a little cream.

My husband and I loved this dish. The sauce is delicious and so easy to make.

This was a good recipe--full-bodied, hearty, and simple to make. For me, it was a bit too heavy, however. To cut the robust flavor of the porcinis with everything else, I'd be interested to hear any suggestions. Overall, quite good and definitely easy. I didn't mind using the porcinis despite their cost. I don't feel the recipe would be nearly the same without...

This is without a doubt the best porcini/tomato sauce I"ve ever made. I can't wait to make it again. I used my own marinara made with tomatoes I roasted, pureed and then froze. Wow!

Sorry, to my last review, I neglected the most important point: no marinara (or tomato sauce). The sundrieds and the TB of ketchup suffice, making it a rich and scrumptious.

We love gnocchi, so I am often in search for something other than pesto. This was delightful, although I will admit to many changes. I sauteed a small onion and two garlic cloves before adding the porcinis. To that mixture, I then added 6 chopped sun-dried tomatoes, which had been packed in oil. (I even used a little of the tomato oil with the butter to saute.) Naturally, I needed to add more cream and broth, and I did this to taste. At the end, now don't laugh, I added a tablespoon of ketchup. The sauce needed to be slightly cut, which the ketchup did quite nicely. It was superb and would be lovely with an arugula/ rucola/rocket (depending from where you hail!) salad and a crisp Sauvignon Blanc for a ladies lunch or book club dinner.

This is a wonderful recipe - except- the idea that any one is using a packaged marinara sauce is just silly. I made this tonight and it was GREAT but I first took the 3 minutes to make an italian tomato sauce. (BTW - I am living in Italy - but tomatoes onions and fresh garlic is the same anywhere.)Take a 1/2 an onion and 2 cloves garlic olive oil fry them til they start to turn color add the porcini mushrooms (after having soaked them the 20 minutes) fry together a bit add a can of great italian tomatoes or add a few fresh ones. Cook a bit. This TAKES NO TIME and is NO BIG EFFORT! add to taste a little red pepper a little porcini bouillion maybe a little thyme, cook a bit you can also add the water from the porcini (Drain the water in a filter or a paper towel or a cheese cloth - it have dirt in it from the porcini) Follow the rest of the recipe add cream or add milk & cream 1/2 & 1/2. The Recipe is brilliant but don't be silly and not make the tomatoe sauce yourself - it is ridiculously easy! I just followed the recipe after that and it was STUPENDOUS. But of course if your basics are bad then your meal is bad. Tomato sauce is EASY, EASY, EASY! And better than canned/bottled(if your tomatoes are good - use a good brand of tomato) If you use good tasting ingredients then your food will taste good. Bad tasting ingredients - the meal tastes bad. Easy! Have fun. This is JMHO - but living in Italy you see that NOBODY buys a bottle of marinara sauce - it is so easy and FAST.

great recipe. As the taste is influenced by the marinara, make sure you use a quality sauce, preferably fresh. Easy enough to prepare during the week. works with fettucine or other pasta as well as gnocchi.

I was not nearly as impressed as I thought I would be, given the rave reviews this recipe has garnered. I thought it was merely okay, not nearly good enough to justify using porcini.

This sauce was fabulous!! The porcini mushrooms added so much flavor. Would make it again and again.

Wow was this good! I doubled the sauce but only used 1 oz. of the porcini mush. and it was just enough for our tastes. I used one pound of medium shell pasta since I had it on hand. I agree with a previous reviewer that this is like something from a fine restaurant. I can't wait to try it with gnocchi.

This pasta dish is quick, easy, delicious and fattening. I would definitely make this again on occasion.

This recipe and another one from this site inspired this PRE-Packaged variation...And, it turns out great. I used 5-Brothers Alfredo with mushrooms (instead of cream and porcini), canned tomatoes with a tiny bit of the liquid (instead of marinara sauce), a little vodka, spiced it up with a little crushed red pepper and let that simmer...and reduce to thicken (if needed). Then put on top of any cooked el dente' pasta or pre-packaged gnocchi add some parmesan cheese and it's WONDERFUL!

I frequently make this recipe. My 3 yr daughter LOVES it. While a bad pasta sauce will kill this dish, I do find that this recipe will jazz up a so-so sauce. Since I usually make this easy dish at the last minute and since I don't keep cream in my fridge all the time, I often substitute evaporated milk. I use about a half cup and let it reduce down. I use a wild mushroom mix from Whole Foods (cheaper than all porcini and tasty too). Gnocchi is hard to find. As we don't have a Trader Joes in TX (major boo-hoo!), I get mine at Cost Plus or Central Market.

I used fresh mushrooms (7 oz, fried without oil), and fewer of the dried porcini. Instead of the canned marinara sauce, I sauteed shallots and garlic in the butter and added a can of peeled tomatoes and some anchovies paste. This may turn out to be our favorite way of eating gnocchi!

I think this recipe depends on the sauce you use, and it came out pretty nasty with the one I used. Like a glob of starchy canned tomato sauce.

This was great. I used a wild muchroom mix (yellow, porcini, black chanterelle) instead of all porcinis. I also sauteed a large clove of garlic in the butter before adding the mushrooms.

I found this sauce to be good, but a little bland and not the best use of the wonderful flavor of porcinis. I doctored it up with some chopped roasted garlic and chives which helped. Also, the cream separated when I added it to the sauce. Nothing the food processor couldn't fix.

This is easy and delicious. The gnocci available at trader joes (imported from italy) is very good with this sauce. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream to lighten it up a little bit and it was still delicious. Tastes like a fine restaurant-style entree.

This is a staple at our dinner parties. Everyone always raves about it. If only they knew how easy and fast it is! Note: the dried mushrooms have very fine grit that is difficult to completely remove. However, we've found a method that works. After soaking the mushrooms, remove them from the liquid and rinse them well under running water. (Be sure to rub the gills gently to get any grit that's hiding.) Then, strain the remaining mushroom soaking liquid through a coffee filter. We put the filter in a wire strainer over a bowl. Works great!
