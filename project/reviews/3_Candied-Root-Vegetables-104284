No smell of gasoline in my rendition, although not as "candied" as I had thought. More sugar and less stock may lead to a more syrupy texture. Also don't cook too long like I did, or the vegatables will get mushy.

The proportions of the ingredients was off and my stock cooked off in less than 5 minutes, burning half of my root vegetables. Also, what wasn't ruined tasted like it had been doused in gasoline. Yuck.

Made this today for Easter and everyone loved it. Didn't use the turnips though!

Just made this for Canadian Thanksgiving; really didn't like it. I followed the directions exactly but the broth never did caramelize. No one enjoyed it. Unfortunately most of it went down the garburator.

Excellent. No changes required. Easy and extremely tasty.

Made this for thanksgiving and it was delicious. However, next time I'll delete the turnips. They didn't taste that great.
