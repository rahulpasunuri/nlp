I followed recipe save for the vinegar, I ran out of red wine, so I use white wine vinegar. Also added some basil. It was absolutely a delicious sandwich filling, I used the recipe for the focaccia, and that was the only complaint from the family. We like a spongier focaccia. It was very summery and flavorful. I recommend a little longer than 30 min. for marinating. I went for an hour, it was perfect!

I added some olive oil, salt and some fresh chopped basil. Then served it on thin slices of toasted bread that I brushed with olive oil. Very simple to make and taste great

Very simple but very flavorful. I used sliced sourdough instead of focaccia and served at a lunch. Everyone loved them. Also, I marinated the tomatoes for a few hours (instead of 30 minutes) in the refrigerator in order to minimize last-minute preparations.

Delicious and great for summer. I've also made it substituting romaine and basil for the arugula. Different flavor but equally as good!
