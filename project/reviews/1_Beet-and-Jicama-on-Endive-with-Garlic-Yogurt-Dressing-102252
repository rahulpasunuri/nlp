Thought this sounded interesting as a salad... I cut it down from a recipe for 50 to one for 2 so the quantities might have been off a little. I used what was called for from the sugar through the fennel,tossed the beets and jicama, then spooned the vegies onto the endive without the liquid. It just wasn't very flavorful.
