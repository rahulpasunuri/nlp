Shall prepare again BUT didn't want to make it super-sweet (American-style) so used 3 TB water & 2 TB sugar + 1 TB lemon juice for 2-1/2 cups fruit & DID strain. Served warm, in wine glasses, atop passionfruit, rasp & lemon gelato-a beautiful colour!

Used in Pepperidge Farm pastries with extra whole berries, fresh whipped cream, & mint sprig. Later, filled pastries with white chocolate mousse, topped with extra blackberries and raspberries, topped with fresh (from the morning) whipped cream and a mint sprig again. My husband and two children (9 & 7) loved it...I thought it was pretty good too. It is a great sauce which an be used in a variety of ways.

Very easy and good, although I would add a little more sugar next time. It's great over Belgian waffles with powdered sugar and angel food cake and whipped cream.

I totally agree with the first reviewer. Delicious and SO easy. I strained it because my husband hates the seeds. We served it on lemon ice cream and that was good, but I think I'm going to make a cheesecake to go with it next time.

Very easy to make. Beautiful color. Wonderful flavor. This sauce and a pound cake is all you need for a quick and elegant dessert.
