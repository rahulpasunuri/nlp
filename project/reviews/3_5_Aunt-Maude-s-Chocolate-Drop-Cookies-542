Following the directions exactly, I found this to be an easily put together recipe for crowd-pleasing cookies. They were wonderfully moist with a very light chocolate flavor, like you'd find at a bakery. I know I'll make them again!

I really can't decide if I'd ever make these again or not. When they were first baked, I have to say that I agree completely with the previous reviewer who said they tasted like health food cookies, and I was seriously disappointed with them! They were very dry baked dough blobs and lacked any depth to their flavor at all--they reminded me of previous experiments with replacing all the fat in a cookie with applesauce, both in flavor and in texture (actually I've gotten much better results with some applesauce experiments than these came out full of fat!). However, after sitting in a sealed container for 24 hours they're much moister and taste much better as well. Now I'd call them "just fine" but nothing to enter in a cook-off. I think the sour cream gives them a very old-fashioned sort of flavor, which is interesting, but I'm not sure I'd ever trust these to moisten up again when other cookie recipes come out great right away....

My dad grew up eating these, they are his favorite cookie (which means my grandma's recipe is the best). The problem is, i don't have her recipe! I was overjoyed when I came across this, but they are definitely an acquired taste. I say forget the frosting, but definitely add chopped walnuts to the dough, that is how I remember them being made. While no one can beat grandma, these are pretty close, will definitely make them again!

I wanted quick cookies I could make with the ingredients I had. These turned out to be cakey balls with icing. They were certainly quick and also tasty, but not savory. I told people they were healthy cookies to make them seem better. Oh well, they're pretty good with coffee.

THIS WAS A GREAT COOKIE! MY KIDS LOVED IT AND MY HUSBAND BROUGHT SOME TO WORK TO SHARE. SOME PEOPLE ARE SO REDICULOUS BY MOCKING THE WAY SOMEONE MISSPELLS A WORD, ETC. WHY NOT FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO WITH YOUR TIME AND GET A LIFE! SO SOMEONE DOESN'T SPELL A WORD THE WAY YOU THINK IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SPELLED. GET A JOB AND A LIFE AND LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE!

Aunt Maude really knows how to design a cookie! These are really chocolately, and I made them for my boyfriend who loves chocolate - he thought they were "delicious." I'll definitely make them again. I did get a little worried after I added the dry ingredients, because the mixture was not homogenizing, but after I added the sour cream, it convalesced nicely.

These cookies are heavenly!! My little girls just love them and beg me to make them often.
