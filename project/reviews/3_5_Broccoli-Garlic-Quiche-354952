A good guide for making a broccoli quiche. I make my own crust and roll it really thin--and I don't prebake it (this is my usual routine for any quiche). I used a cup of whole milk, not half/half, and sprinkled the cheese in BEFORE adding the broccoli. It was a bit garlicky but was enjoyed by all nonetheless.

Terrific! I chopped up the steamed broccoli into tiny pieces, and mixed all the filling ingredients together before pouring it into the crust. Mine cooked a lot faster (crust completely done in about 30 minutes, another 30 minutes for the filled quiche) -- might just be my oven, though. Kids and hubby devoured it!

I've made this quiche at least a half dozen times now and it's wonderful each time. So, so good. It's wonderfully rich and full of great flavours despite being fairly simple. Making the crust from scratch is definitely worth it. Smittenkitchen.com has a great overview of how to make a perfect crust. Highly, highly recommended!

This turned out exactly as promised. I used slightly less cheese than it called for but this was a (minor) mistake. Don't skimp.

LOVED this! Changed things up a bit so that I could bake two whole pies: didn't alter anything, except that I used 8 eggs instead of 6 and 2 c. 2% milk instead of the 1.5 c. half-and-half. Sauteed 1/8 of a yellow onion and the garlic, then added it and all the cheese to the egg mix. I divided the broccoli between the two baked pie crusts (1.25 c. broccoli florets/pie), then poured all the egg-cheese mixture on top. Baked with aluminum foil covering the pie crust edges x 40 minutes, then removed the foil for the last 5 minutes. Served with breakfast potatoes.

I followed the recipe exactly. This is the worst recipe I have made from Epicurious. The ingredients did not fit in the pan and the baking directions leave the top edges burned before the custard is set. Not even the dog liked it.

This is great for a luncheon or late afternoon company. You should definitely use the butter crust; the favor is amazing especially with the other ingredients. I can hardly wait to try this again with some of the suggestions of other readers (like the bacon and/or saute the garlic). Oh, and it chills and microwaves the next day at work--so good.

My family LOVED this quiche. I didn't want a vegetarian quiche so I added crumbled bacon (three strips cooks crips in the microwave). It was so popular I've made it twice since.

Made recipe per directions. Used a deep dish pie plate and all ingredients fit. Did take longer for me to bake the quiche than directions indicated. I prefer my cheese incorporated into the egg rather than sitting all on top. Will mix it in with the broccoli and eggs next time. Otherwise it was pretty good.

I used a frozen pie crust, so next time I would make my own just to give it an extra push. Otherwise this recipe was perfect. I loved the garlic and cheeses and the texture was great. I enjoyed it both at room temperature and warmed up. Definitely a new staple. I would love to play around with the additions, maybe some bacon or ham, onions, whatever you have on hand could easily be added to this. But as is is also very lovely.

Okay-not much flavor-even added more garlic-could use pancetta or something also not very fluffy

I've made this several times and it's wonderful. Take head of the suggestions to not overmix the dough. I found that the dough required less cooking time then recipe stated. I added bacon - you can get away with less salt you do so. Also I found that I didn't need the full liquids required and used 2/3 of the eggs/milk.Used homo milk and all spice instead of nutmeg. I always make 2 and freeze one for later.

After reading the comments about the amount of filling, I cut back to 4 eggs, 1 cup of milk and half+half combined, approx. 8 oz. broccoli and probably a bit too much garlic. This mixture filled a frozen 9" deep dish crust very nicely (prebaked), and no overflow. Came out bubbly and browned on top. Next time I would consider sauteing the garlic a bit, maybe with some onion, before adding to liquid.

very good recipe! The subtle nutmeg taste made it so delicious!It is better than any other quiche recipe I have tried!!!

I added marinated sundried tomatoes to it for added taste and replaced half and half and the cheeses with Non fat yogurt and fat free cottage cheese. very tasty, yet a bit lower in calories. I also find it a convenient break fast, as you can keep it in fridge and warm it in toaster oven the next day. love it!

I didn't bother to chill the crust and all that. Just got it together in the food processor and spread it out into the pie tin with my fingers and baked it for ~35-40 min. I subbed boiled collard greens in for the broccoli and used one less egg and 1/2 c less milk. It turned out great! Love the flavors of the cheeses with the flaky butteriness of the crust. Also pretty easy in the end with these shortcuts.

Agree, this is a good way to use up veggies you have on hand. I'll try it with bell pepper next time. I don't think you need to pre-cook the broccoli, though, since it goes in the oven for 45-50 min. To make it a little healthier, I used 1.5c soy milk instead of 1/2-n-1/2; and instead of butter, a cube of Smart Balance (which admittedly tastes nothing like butter, but it was OK). I thought the proportions for a 9-in pie pan were perfect.

My hubby, and well I, are picky when eating veggies. This is a GREAT and tasty way to incorporate them into meals. Also if you put it in the fridge, if there are any leftovers, it tastes better the next day too!

Wow! I thought this was delicious - it did make too much filling, so I filled a small casserole dish w/the extra custard, plunked in the few extra broccoli florets, topped w/cheeses and baked it alongside the quiche. The filling alone is super rich & flavorful - very cheesy, a little kick from the cayenne, some depth of flavor thanks to the nutmeg. This is going in the recipe file for sure.

The proportions on this recipe are incorrect. You're going to need a 10-inch pie crust, or larger if you want a touch more broccoli. Otherwise expect to waste time and/or ingredients.

A very tasty dish. I did add sauteed onion and cheese to the filling. Just make sure you have a deep dish pie plate. I did not and ended up making two quiches, the filings of which both overflowed and baked around the outside of the crust. Would have been prettier and maybe a little more tasty if all the filling remained in one pie. I used the butter pastry recipe, too, and it really made the quiche.

I've made this quiche before and thought it was okay, but having just made the Mushroom and Fontina quiche recipe from this website, I will be sticking to that one from now on. Check it out!

Yummy--more flavorful than expected. Used 1/2 c. 1/2&1/2 and 1 c. 2% instead of all 1/2&1/2 Still tasted plenty rich. Otherwise, made it to recipe.

Super easy and one of the few quiche recipes that both my husband and I think is better the next day. I often cook and deliver dishes to my in-laws. After my mother-in-law raved about this dish, we sampled again the next morning and liked it even better than the night before.

Great recipe; easy to modify for all but the Julia Childs Palate club. I used smaller pie pan so used only 4 eggs and 1 cup of half/half. I used non-fat half/half, to reduce cholesterol, and could have used Egg- beaters without losing much taste. I use some swiss in place of some cheddar, for lighter taste. A tasty and pretty variation is raw, short asparagus spears, pointing to the rim, with a few cherry tomato halves in the very center. A scattering of capers couldn't hurt!

I made this last night for dinner in addition to a baby greens salad. Sooo good! I used the flakey pie crust recipe from this website. I added half of a thin sliced onion that I caramelized adding the garlic in the last 30 seconds. I realize this is alot of work for a quiche, I had the crust already. Browning an onion gives this recipe that extra boost I think it needs to be a show stopper! Yummy!

the dough recipe was great -- made it the day before, refrigerated all day and overnight and all the next day. baked blind, then poured in the filling which was wayyyy too much. not wanting to waste i poured it all in anyway, which meant a good amount of spillage onto the cookie sheet and basically an entire lost egg (do not forget the cookie sheet). i thought it was going to be awful, but it was actually delicious. the dough was really flaky. i used extra garlic which was good but probably unnecessary as it yielded a distinctly garlicky quiche. i'd definitely make it again, though i'd probably slightly reduce the filling amounts next time around.

Also just wanted to add that it is a very easy recipe, the only time-consuming part is letting the dough chill in the refrigerator for a total of one and a half hours.

I served this to my family tonight with a salad. I did everything exactly as the recipe said, with a few minor changes from the advice of previous reviewers. I added an extra clove of garlic, doubled the salt, and mixed half of the cheese in with the filling. Oh, and my mother can't handle pepper, so I only put in half of the cayenne. Also added a little bit of white pepper. It was very good, and everyone at the table said so. I agree that it was good, but I think it could be better. Like a previous reviewer said, it was a little one-note, but definitely worth making. I've never made crust before, and it turned out beautifully.

I don't usually write reviews for recipes that I totally butcher... but let me just say that you CANNOT substitute the heavy cream with Vanilla Slimfast. Nope. I don't recommend it. Other than the vanilla essence it was fabulous - added minced onion. RIP Gourmet Magazine :****(

Delicious! Perfect dinner paired with a salad. I did use prepared dough for the crust. I also added leeks sauted in butter. My husband and I loved it, but my 5 yr old daughter thought it was a bit too spicy (cayenne). I will definitely be making this again.

Although I used a prepared pie crust (Marie Callendar), I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was good, but the flavor seemed pretty "one note" to me. I feel like it needs additional ingredients to add some layers of flavor.

I have to say, I didn't like the garlic in it. So odd, cause I regularly use/like garlic. Instead of half and half, I used half heavy whipping cream, half 1%. The quiche turned out perfectly light and fluffy, browned a little on top, it really was pretty:) I did use an organic store bought crust due to time. I look forward to making this in the future, maybe sans garlic, or roast garlic prior. definitely good for the basic recipe, and modify additions!

This was the First Quice I've ever made. It turned out okay, crust burned a little (made it a bit thing I suppose). I should have also added more garlic. But was pretty good.

This is a fairly good recipe. I doubled the garlic and added a small red onion that I'd sauteed in a little oil. Next time I would double the salt and mix at least half of the cheese into the custard.
