I loved this flavor combination- it elevated simple chard into something absolutely delicious. I could have eaten the whole pot in one sitting. I used a bag of rainbow chard from Trader Joe's, which was only 10 oz, so that changed the ratio of chard to "extras" considerably.

I made this with 1/4 of the chard, not measuring anything but just guesstimating. I used the chard stems (mine were quite small) because I didn't want to waste them, but definitely do cook them a few extra minutes before adding the rest of the chard. I didn't use a fancy paprika, which I guess would have made it better, but it was still fantastic. It was very colourful and pretty and likely my favourite quick chard sautee I've tried.

This is a great everyday recipe for swiss chard. If you have a farm share/csa, then this recipe if for you. Adding apples is also good for this recipe.

I would add more onion, but this was very tasty and easy to prepare.

A wonderful dish - I have made it many times and everyone I serve it to loves it.!

This is excellent. I've made it with onions and with leeks. I think it's even better with the substitution of leeks. The second time I made it, I added a slash of cider vinegar to give it a bit of acid. This is an excellent weeknight dish.

Delicious and easy! Substituted 4 thinly sliced garlic cloves for onions, left out paprika and just threw the raw almond slices in with the raisins, and it turned out wonderful. Served with Chicken with Roasted Lemons, Green Olives and Capers for an amazing easy dinner worthy of guests.

Quick easy & very tasty. I'm always looking for new twists on greens, because they're so healthy.

Wow, my husband actually ate the chard and asked for seconds. I am still kind of stunned. I did not use the paprika but I added a tiny splash of high-quality balsamic. I used sliced almonds, although I was tempted to switch for pinenuts- the almonds were just right, though. On top of the yummy taste, the dish was very pretty. Definitely making again!

This is the first time I've made Swiss Chard and I am now a convert. I love Swiss Chard!!! This recipe is delicious and is a great first intro to Swiss Chard. As others wrote, I omited the 1/2 cup water, there was enough left on the leaves after washing to cook the leaves. This is a fantastic recipe and will be a staple at our house!

An easy, flavorful way to add chard to the menu. Carmelized the onions and added the golden raisins and paprika. The chard had plenty of water clinging to the leaves; tossed them in and cooked them for about 5 minutes (no additional water added, no lid.) Finished by incorporating a little salt, pepper and chopped almonds. Delicious!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM. My husband and I LOVE this dish... the flavors all complement each other so well and so interestingly. The smoked paprika is a MUST... I like teh idea of previous reviewers to sautee the stems with the onions - I have had this recipe before with whole swiss chard leaves and it was very good (though harder to eat). If you like smoked paprika, and appreciate a good swiss chard, try this recipe!

Loved the recipe as it is. I threw out the ribs, but it was a lot of work removing them and I would try it again with the ribs included to cut down on prep time. I've done this recipe with regular raisins, but it is way way better with golden raisins.

Rating: 3
I threw out my stalks because I didn't read the reviews first, and next time I'll put them in as suggested. I used regular raisins. I overcooked my chard... I think 7 minutes is too long. I'll make it again and thought it was very good.

Rating: 4
Chard is in season now, and I found this recipe to be a great way to showcase its deliciousness and versatility. As suggested, I chopped up the ribs and sauteed them with the onions - how can you throw away such healthy and wonderfully-colored stuff?! I also toasted the almonds in the oven, rather than in a pan, to cut down on the amount of oil. This dish is warm and hearty, great for a fall meal. I can definitely see it going well with a Thanksgiving dinner.

this is very good, but not great. easy to make and healthy for sure.

I made a mistake in my review. The raisins are plumped in hot water, drained and added at the end in the traditionsl dish. Only the nuts are heated in the oil at the beginning. Sorry for the error.

This is a modification of the classic Italian recipe for spinach with raisins and pine nuts -- which I prefer. The flavor mix in this recipe did not work. We liked the almonds, but the flavor of the raisins got lost in the bitterness of the chard and the onions added nothing. The classic Italian method of heating the nuts and raisins in the oil and then adding the greens might result in a better dish. Someone else can try that, there are many much better chard recipes on this web site.

Excellent, this is by far my new favorite chard recipe, the sweetness of the raisins (i used plain) work wonderfully and the almonds kick it up a notch

Rating: 3
Excellent side dish! All the flavors worked well together. I would add half the water next time and cook 2 minutes less as the chard was overdone. I agree with using the ribs ... why throw them away?

I make this at leat twice a month. It is wonderful as written. Very amenable to substitution. I have substituted ass sorts of different dried fruits, wild blueberries from Trader Joe's may be my favorite (great for the anti-oxidants) also hazelnuts are a great substitution for the almonds.

I love the taste of chard ribs (esp. red chard), so I chopped them up and added to the onion stage of this recipe. Still delicious! Will make again.

This was an excellent side dish to a vegetarian turkey and stuffing combo I got at the Whole Foods deli. I had to make do with regular raisins and slivered almonds due to limitations of what I had on hand, but nonetheless my wife and I both thought it was a delightful blend of flavors.

I didn't have smoked paprika, so I used regular and cut back a bit on the water. Other than that, I prepared as directed and was really pleased. As was suggested, I finished it at serving with a splash of high quality balsamic. Delicious!

I'm not a big vegetable person and so have been trying to increase my intake. I happened to have all these ingredients on hand and so followed the recipe pretty exactly, though I only had one bunch of chard so the proportions were a little off. Really nice mix of flavors--the chard being a little bitter, the raisins sweet, the almonds added a little crunch and the onions were nice and smoky. Easy to make and very tasty. What more could one want?

Very tastey. I used butter in place of the olive oil, only 1 pound of Swiss chard, regular paprika and 1/4 cup of water. Next time I will omit the water and sprinke feta cheese on top!

Excellent! I have made this a number of times and have even had raves using variations including dried figs, currants, and even substituting other greens for the Swiss chard.

The tastes were good, but the texture was soggy and unappealing. I would try it again, but only with heavy modifications.

I found this recipe after finding some gorgeous rainbow chard at the farmers market. I had it as a vegetarian meal, and my partner ate it as a side. Good and very healthful.

I found this recipe to use all the swiss chard in my garden, and it was fantastic. I used hazelnuts instead of almonds and it was wonderful. I highly recommend this recipe

this is an excellent preparation for Swiss Chard. I added nearly a teaspoon of high quality cinnamon. It was delicious. I also chop the stems and cook them a minute after the onion. They add a nice color.

This is a wonderful side dish. I have made it with many variations using different kinds of greens, different dried fruits like golden raisons, dried currants, dried cherries, sun-dried tomatoes, dried pomegranate seeds, etc. as well as different nuts and seeds. A splash of basalmic vinegar also finishes this dish deliciously!

This was great! Mixed this with pasta and topped with both feta and parmesean which made a great meal. Used sweet paprika, and truffle salt.

Yay! Great taste and healthy. Paired with brown fluffy rice and Hormel ready roasted chicken from a local grocer was a great dinner. Next time I'll serve around Thanksgiving and pair it with cranberry on the side.

this was absolutely delish! We didn't have raisens so we substituted dried cherries and it was so good that we're planning to make it for a dinner party tomorrow. Thanks!

Rave review! I cooked it for Thanksgiving and t was perfect. Changed a couple of things: I used a few fresh grapes instead of raisins (which were alreay in the stuffing) and chestnuts, roasted and sliced, instead of almonds. I also recommend using the stems if you parboil them well before.

This is one of the best chard recipes I've tried. I make it a lot with raisins and pine nuts which is why this caught my eye. Really liked the combination of the almonds with the smoked paprika. I finished it with a it of sherry vinegar to balance it out. Really delicious and will be something we make regularly. Like others I used the stems...no sense in throwing those out!

One of my absolute favorite recipes. It is a delicious way to prepare these healthy greens. The smoked paprika really gives a unique flavor.

This was a wonderful way to eat chard. I did substitute dried cranberries and slivered almonds and added more olive oil, but I would have been lost without this recipe. I can't wait to make it again!

Excellent. I'm so glad I discovered this easy preparation for the bushels of chard in my garden! Turned this into a main dish by tossing the cooked chard w/rotelli pasta and topping w/a little crumbled feta. The saltiness of the feta worked well w/the sweet raisins and crunchy nuts.

Nice recipe. ok w/o water. Sautee stems with onions.

Rating: 3
I liked the contrast of flavors. I used the stems, sauteeing them with the onions as suggested, but added a bit too much salt and paprika (my own fault!). The raisins saved this with the sweet contrast. I used marcona almonds which were great with this dish. next time I will add less seasoning..

Rating: 3
This was very good! Hubby and I followed the recipe to the T, and we decided that next time we plan to add extra smoked paprika, and extra raisins. We felt, for our personal taste, it needed a bit more of both. But otherwise, we LOVED it! I had a second helping, and hubby had a third! And then later on snuck the last lil' bit and ate it as a late-night snack! Eager to try it again, with the few tweaks, after which I may consider it a rating of 4 instead. ;)

Delicious! I didn't have smoked paprika, so I used the regular kind. Also, I sauteed the chard stalks with the onions as suggested. And I toasted the almonds for a few minutes in the toaster oven, this gives them more flavor.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, but don't waste the stems; they offer good nutrition and texture. Cut them from the leaves, then slice them about 1/8 of an inch thick and add them to the onions, so they will be sauteed and soft before the leaves are added to wilt. By the way, smoked paprika is becoming mainstream. I've seen it by both McCormick and Spice Islands in the supermarkets, and Sam's Club carries a large jar (Spice Islands) at a very attractive price.

This was a winner - we ate every bite. Like the previous reviewer, we did not need the full half cup of water either. Could not find the smoked paprika, so we subbed chipotle chili pepper. Will make this one again for sure.

I used shallots instead of onion, and I didn't add the 1/2 cup water -- the wilted chard mixture didn't need it. Very good flavor. Served with ginger baked chicken and sweet potatoes.
