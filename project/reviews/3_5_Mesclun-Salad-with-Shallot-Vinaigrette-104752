I've already chosen to make it several times. It is simple and pure and it is perfectly appropriate for basic greens to accompany a more complex meal. I would not have thought to add this much mustard on my own so I am most grateful for this recipe. Oh, and use Trader Joe's dijon if you can find it near you. Rated the very best dijon available in America. And it is made in France!

Excellent french vinaigrette. I didn't measure the shallots, just used 2 large ones. I also added a pinch of salt, pepper and some flat-leaf parsley. Like others, I made it in a food processor -- came out lovely. Used it to dress a mixed baby green salad with almonds, pears, and canned tuna

This was my first time using shallots in a dish. I think a splash more of the vinegar would have been better. It was slightly bland and the shallots made the spicy kick a bit much for me.

A fabulous basic! And, I just now realized the full potential of my mini cuisinart... Threw it all in and with the press of a button it was done! especially since the shallots I had were uncommonly potent. I have used lemon juice with a dash of sugar in the past when I didn't have good vinegar at hand.

Really classic French-style shallot vinaigrette. It's my go-to basic recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I paired the mesclun salad with blue cheese, dried cranberries, pistachio nuts, and pear. This is a great lunch!

I used the vinaigrette with a mesclun salad with pears, pecans, avocados and pears. Twelve guests raved about it. I emulsified it with the kitchen aid and the whisk attachment, a tip I learned from a chef friend. I think that helps.

This is a quick and easy recipe that I tried at Christmas time. It quickly became the family favorite! I use it again & again.

my husband's favorite--he is disappointed if we have any other dressing! I sometimes cut the oil just a tad, maybe up the dijon, depending on the bitterness of the greens. We love it

I used a little less oil and it still worked well. Baby spinach with some thin sliced red onion was delicious. Quick and simple. Husband also enjoyed it.

This is excellent - I've made it many times. I sometimes increase the olive oil to 1/2 cup if the shallot taste is too strong. This dressing is also spectacular on bibb lettuce or with spinach.

It was too spicey for some of my guests. I would not make it again.

Finally, a salad dressing with a kick! My French friend loved it. Just 3 forks though, I think just a little less shallots & it would be perfect.
