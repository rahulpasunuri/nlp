made this without the marrow and it was FABULOUS, I will try it with the marrow next time, but I can't imagine it can get any better.

You absolutely HAVE to have the marrow in the sauce. It adds a richness and complexity that makes this dish so delicious. Otherwise the sauce is simply a red wine sauce. Go the extra step - your guests will notice the difference.

We've made this dish several times now and it keeps getting better. Rave reviews from our guests and it is so easy to prepare!

I received a standing ovation for this dish. Have the butcher tie the meat for you in advance.

Wonderful sauce! I did leave out the marrow. I just didn't see the need for it. I was great without it.

I made this and omitted the marrow- just made the sauce, and it was delicious.

For some strange reason, I just spent 3 days of my "free-time" in the kitchen making Espagnole Sauce, and Demi-Glace. I have no clue why I bothered, other than the store I was in had the right amount of bones for the recipe, and it was fun. Now I am going to be on the lookout for marrow bones.
