Excellent, easy to prepare, crunchy and delicious.

One more thing--in response from the cook from New Orleans (4/22/06)--I used pancetta and lightly pre-cooked it before putting it in the mixture. It worked very well.

Amazingly delicious recipe. HOWEVER, I followed the instructions quite closely and the cakes did not hold together. I tried adding egg...more bread ... but it turned out that all I needed was a bit more corn flour(/starch). So if they are looking a bit crumbly, before you put them in the pan, just keep mixing in teaspoonfuls of starch until the mixture looks properly sticky ... but the flavor is simply wonderful! And the mayo is also great (save some for sandwiches the next day ...!).

An absolute hit. Very easy to make, and totally delicious. These would make very nice canapes, scaled down of course, with a dab of the mayo on the top or as a dip. Have a go - you will not be sorry!

This is an extremely versatile recipe - I have used baked proscuitto or bacon bits in lieu of the raw bacon in the recipe. I also use crushed almonds, and bake the cakes on parchment paper at 400F for about 15 to 20 minutes.

The flavor is delicious, but the cakes fell apart and I am unconvinced that the raw bacon really cooked. In addition the almonds burned--just too much trouble for so many "issues". I was afraid to hold the leftovers since I thought uncooked bacon could be a problem. Not worth the hassle...

Loved the almonds, but really hated the dish, including the mayo. Followed the recipe exactly, but the flavors and texture just didn't work for my family. Threw much of it away. Needless to say I won't be making it again.

Sorry, I meant to say that the only trouble I had was preventing the cakes from falling apart (see the review below).

This recipe was delicious. I didn't know if I was going to like that mayo but that was the "it" factor to this recipe. We are actually using some leftover mayo to spread on tuna salad sandwiches. One problem I had though was making the cakes from falling apart. I chopped everything so maybe next time I should put it through a food processor? any ideas? Will definitely make again though, this was excellent.

This recipe is super delicious. I am making it for the second time tomorrow. I made it without the bacon though for my vegetarian friend's benefit. It was great.

My sister made this as the 1st course of a 4-course meal & I still wanted more. The almonds were a delicious surprise to the yummy shrimp cakes. The lemon soy mayo was delicioso! We liked them soo much we convinced her to make them again at our Christmas Eve Italian Seafood tradition this weekend!!!! They were soo YUMMMMMMY!!!!!!

This is so delicious that when I served them at a dinner party, all the guests clamoured for more! They are very easy to make and the taste is excellent. I will certainly make them again.

These were very easy, and very good. We had problems as some other did with the cakes burning, but we just turned down the heat a bit and it all worked out. We will definitely make these again.

I thought this was really tasty and different. I used turkey bacon instead and it turned out great. The almonds were a nice touch. My young daughter loved them. Definitely would make again.

This was a wonderful recipe that my bunko group loved. Just emailed it to everyone. It looks a little odd when you chop everything. Trust the process- it works well and tastes fabulous. Cooking time was accurate.

My husband loved these cakes. As for me, I'll eat almond crusted anything. I made a lemon/basil/mayo that I found with a crab cake recipe to go with them, (which was quite delicious), but since the soy mayo sauce is getting such rave reviews, next time I'll make it. Served with a green salad, a perfect and elegant dinner.

did anyone cook the bacon first?

Fabulous! This was a special birthday lunch, very special. The plates looked like they had come from the dishwasher, every speck was eaten. Nothing but raves from the guests and I have to include my own. Easy, quick and well worth the time and expense. Perfect

I brought this dish to share with a small gathering of friends and EVERYONE loved it! For ease and speed, I used pre-peeled frozen medium-sized black tiger prawns. I didn't have white bread on hand, so used whole grain. I also used a little extra garlic (always do). It was FANTASTIC, and relatively easy to make. I am sharing the recipe with family and friends who have requested it.

the soy mayannaise was superb and I have used it in many other applications, the cakes were a bit dry and blah

To Jeez - what is wrong with Gulf Coast Lady using shrimp for shrimp cakes?

Rating: 0
Jeez, GulfCoast lady . . . sometimes you have to splurge. Usually certain things are more expensive than other things for a reason: they're better! To always cut corners is bad for one's self-esteem. It's like a daily reminder to yourself and your family that you/they are not worth it.

I'll make this again with some changes. My husband loved it. We like crab cakes and shrimp is a lot cheaper than crabmeat. The mayo is a little bland. I agree that adding chopped cilantro is a good idea; adds flavor and color. I would not use large shrimp again. Medium are a lot cheaper and, since they are chopped up, who knows or cares. Why almonds? They are expensive here. When I got the oil hot enough to keep the cakes from getting greasy, the almonds browned too much. Any ideas out there? Next time I will use coarse pecan meal or Japanese panko.

I resisted the temptation to "improve" the recipe and they were delicious! The lemon soy mayo is a great recipe and usable with other dishes. My husband loved them and has pronounced this dish a "keeper!"

Next time I make this recipe I will add 2 garlic cloves and a dash or two of hot sauce to the cakes before cooking. Also, if the bacon used is thick sliced and smoked the flavor is a bit strong. The mayonaise is better after chilling a few hours. My family liked this recipe very much and I will certainly make it again.

I decided to make this dish because it was one of the few shrimp or crab cake recipes I have seen that didn't require inordinate amounts of bread crumbs. It also contains bacon, cilantro and scallions, which are some of my favorite ingredients. The dish was surprisingly easy to make, the cakes turned out beautifully; they were moist and flavorful. This is a rich dish, but one worth making. Two of us made a meal out of the shrimp cakes and a light salad. The only variation I would make to the recipe is that the cakes seemed to need more time cooking than indicated.

Genius is the person that created this recipe. I love the cakes, reminds me of Dim Sum (my sis says it tastes like omlet), but the soy-mayo makes it out of this world. I did them 1/2 inch thick. Served with a wheat berry salad. Make extra mayo...everyone loves mayo.

I just tried this recipe last evening. The shrimp cakes were spectacular although they took a lot of time to put together. Once the shrimp is peeled and all the ingredients are chopped, however, they cook very quickly. I whipped the lemon soy mayonnaise in a small food processor, which made it very creamy. I liked the shrimp, almond, and cilantro flavors together. I can't see that the bacon added much and it's not something I often have on hand. I wonder if coconut would work with this one? I'll definitely make these cakes again.

An easier prep is to process in order, the scallions, cilantro, "squeezed out" bread, the cornstarch and seasonings, then the shelled shrimp coarsely processed before forming into patties. Some cayenne was good too. But overall, a fast and tasty comfort food. We're going to try a wasabi sauce next to serve alongside the good lemon mayo.

This just didn't work for me and my husband. It seemed like it would be right up our alley -- shrimp, nuts, bacon, all of it fried -- but it was just kinda feh. A bit of work for something that just didn't taste like much of anything. Oh well.

Loved this! I thought the sauce needed some crunch, however, so I diced up a little bit of onion and also added a little cilantro for color.

To Connecticut: Start with uncooked shrimp & bacon. Follow the recipe and they'll get cooked toward the end of the recipe. Good Luck!

This sounds deliteful, but I would need to know if the bacon is cooked or raw, and also the shrimp. Thanks Colleen

This recipe was out of this happy world! Very fast and easy to do. Did not have cilantro so substituted fresh basil. The bacon I had was maple smoked so I left the sugar out and I didn't have cornstarch so I used 1 tsp flour instead. Served with a bit of fresh arugula for a quick dinner. Try this!!
