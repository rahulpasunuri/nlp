this did not work for me at all! i'm not sure what went wrong, but what i did learn from this is 1) it's rather disgusting how much oil eggplant can absorb, 2) make sure the eggplant is cooked all the way through! it will probably take longer than the recommended time, and 3) make sure the tomatoes are top - notch! less than superior tomatoes will make this dish very bland. with how much work went into this, i think it will be a long time before i give this a second try.

Very tasty and vegetarian (vegan) to boot! I've made this many times and usually find the last 3 tablespoons olive oil to be too much.

This was a nice dish, and adults and children liked the flavors. I'll make it again.

The preparation is time-consuming, but worth it. We cook a lot and are always trying new recipes. But when we have dinner get-togethers, we find ourselves coming back to this recipe when we want a sure-fire hit.A great accompanying side dish is the asparagus risotto, also from the same issue. It too gets requests from repeat dinner guests.
