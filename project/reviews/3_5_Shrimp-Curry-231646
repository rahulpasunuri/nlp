I thought a bit bland for a Curry. Will make the adjustments others suggested - more curry, add a little green Thai curry paste, cumin, garlic. Also, just hand chop the veggies - a food processor turns it into mush to fast.

Like others, this was very bland when made as per recipe (this was using chiken stock instead of water and half the amount). However, once you add additional spice - cumin, tumeric and corriander and double the curry, it was very tasty. So, I only gave 2 forks as the recipe as written is just OK. The final product once seasoning is adjusted, was delicious and easy to make.

Everyone was correct, about half the water was the amount one should use. Other then that I made it exactly as written and it was VERY delicious. My only fault was not making enough rice. Oh, I did add some salt..It really needed it.

i made my own curry powder for this. and used about 10 times what was required. next time i will make this the day before i want to eat it without the coconut milk. add it the next day, cut the serrano peppers thinner to add more spice, and put some orange peppers & other veggies in it. it just did not thicken enough for my tastes. and it needs way more spice imo. i also doubled the amount of shrimp. and used it on jasmine rice instead of basmati, which was a good call. yummy, but needs slight improvements.

I used this as a base to create a thai curry i had in a restaurant and it was delishious. After Step 1, I added 2 tsp of Curry, A pinch of tumeric, 1 tsp of green chili paste (for some zing) and finely chopped fresh corriander. Then I added only 3/4 cups of water with the coconut milk. I also quickly stir-fried my favorite veggies is a wok (peppers, brocoli, mushrooms & onions) in oil and a bit of curry powder. I think this made the big difference... IT WASN'T BLAND AT ALL! The Veggies and Shrimp on rice with that Sause was a HUGE Hit.

I used about half of the oil that the recipe called for & it was still very delicious. Easy to prepare. Served with rice & a warm Asian slaw w/spicy, peanut butter dressing. Yummy!

This was disgusting!! I love indian food and I found this to be very bland.

i decided to try this recipe despite the numerous reviews describing it as bland. i figured people's palettes vary. i found it to be very very boring. i added garlic to the onion stage, in addition to doubling the curry, & adding 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of ground cardamom, 1 tsp of cumin & 1 tsp of sugar to the sauce. what ultimately saved our experience, was our pairings of braised lentils (also from this site) and a vinho verde. rather than make this again, i will be looking for another curry recipe. boo.

I loved this dish. I will definately reduce the water next time, and add extra curry powder and a third pepper, but for all intents and purposes as a quick and easy dish..it rocks!

I agree with those who said the water needs to be reduced but next time I'll use 1/3 cup. I added carrots sliced on the diagonal and snow peas, also didn't use a food processor and just chopped the onions.

didnt love this. Perhaps because I had to omit the chilies (was cooking for my kids too) but it was just totally bland. I added some peas to give color and some chopped garlic too but it was just so so. Kids liked the "sweetness" of it, but didnt really seem very Thai inspired to me.

This was a fabulous, easy dish that impressed many. I took the suggestions and added garlic (in the onion stage), some pineapple chunks, and doubled the curry powder. This is going to make the regular rotation in our household.

You can safely double the amount of curry in this recipe -- especially if you are using a milder curry. Also, I added pineapple with the shrimp and omitted the lime juice. Red bell pepper would be a nice addition, as well as cilantro as garnish.

Agree with the suggestion to cut down the water to 1/2 cup. Thought it was a bit bland and runny. Will add more curry powder and garlic. Will try the sweetened coconut milk next time. Thought it could have been sweeter.

DELICIOUS! So flavorful, easy to follow instructions. I didn't have a food processor so I finely chopped by hand. Still quite good. Made it several times, always a hit!

We love this recipe. We make it again and again, although I have often substituted chicken for the shrimp in a pinch. I would say that the recipe doesn't really remind me of Indian food as much as Thai, largely because of the coconut milk sauce. Then again, it was in an issue about London, so perhaps it's a bit of a hybrid.

Delicious! I used coconut milk, water and lime. Fab!!!

I followed the recipe closely and when finished, I felt it lacked the flavor I was expecting of coconut-based curries. I was surprised that the recipe did not call for tumeric, coriander, mustard seed, cloves and other similar ingredients commonly found in these dishes (it also needed more salt). I don't think I will use this recipe again.

Great recipe!!! Subbed Lemon for Lime & frozen melon for coconut milk and it turned out fantastic!!!

I did this the first time with a combination of defrosted frozen shrimp and some tofu, which was terrific. Last night I used tofu only (no shrimp) and tossed in some sliced zucchini a couple of minutes before it was done... Unorthodox, of course, but this dish seems to lend itself well to improvisation. Love it. And it's cheap with just tofu!

My husband is from the Caribean and we are big curry fans thanks to the Indian influence... I loved this recipe but talking about changing recipes: I was shure I had the coconut milk and then i didn't! Well, i used A RIPE MANGO instead and the result was DELICIOUS! I also added some basil leaves to serve and a bit more garlic and ginger as other suggested. May be was the quality of curry i use: it's a Madras i get in Trinidad... AND i made this in less than 20 min! (and i don't own a food procesor!)

I am a big fan of curry. After reading the reviews I used 2 Tbs of good quality curry, added garlic, and some additional spices like Balti and cayanne. The result was quite good. Don't skimp on the salt, however, since after all the added flavorings it still need a kick when serving with plain basmati rice.

I am not a curry fan but I love this recipe. This so easy to make and tastes great. I add a clove of garlic with the onion and a sprinkle of red hot pepper flakes at the end. This dish will convert any non-curry eater.

I'm not sure that the recipe itself flawed but the use of coconut milk seems to lend itself to a Thai-style curry rather than Indian? I followed the recipe precisely and didn't like the flavor - too bitter. Perhaps I don't like the taste of madras curry powder. If I make this recipe again, I'll either make my own yellow/turmeric curry paste or use one of the canned yellow or red pastes instead of madras curry powder.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. Easy to make and I love the raw curry (the pureed onion&ginger). I like to add quartered mushrooms and minced garlic to the onions & ginger in the sugar, salt, and oil. I also add cilantro at the end and crunchy bean sprouts on top. I also sometimes use jasmine rice or rice sticks, or bean thread noodles to accompany this yummy dish.

This was my first attempt at a curry.I was looking for a recipe for shrimp, and thanks to my favorite "Coconut Bundt Cake with Powdered Sugar Glaze" (also on this site), I ALWAYS keep unsweetened coconut milk in the house. I didn't have the serranos, so I used bell peppers instead, and a fresh jalapeno. I thought it needed more curry powder, but maybe the no-name brand I use isn't that good. It was a little time consuming for me, but worth it. My husband liked it too, but thought the sauce was ugly- it broke.I didn't add any water-it seemed to be the right consistency. Maybe I'll use less oil next time or throw in a pinch of flour to emulsify the sauce. Definitely will make it again.

Forgive me for those who don't like us to alter recipes--I love this dish, however, I use red curry paste and low-fat coconut milk, which turns out fine (you can add a slurry if your version is too thin). This dish went from yummy to awesome when I added a couple of Tbsp peanut butter and some green beans. Deelish!

Rating: 2
This recipe was definitely too bland to be an Indian style curry - but it has potential! I changed the recipe by using 2 T curry powder, 1 t garam masala, 1 t cayenne, 2 T minced garlic (which I added with the curry powder, masala, and chilis). I also added about a cup of frozen asparagus from Trader Joe's. Don't settle for bland curry!!

My husband and I loved this recipe and would serve it for guests. I upped the curry powder also and wondered too if I could use curry paste. Has anyone tried it? I also only used 1/2 the water and the curry was thick and flavorful even though I did use the low fat coconut milk.

Wow--lots of comments on this one. I think this was a great base, but a little too bland. I would definately make this again after the following alterations: more Madras curry powder, some cayenne, ground coriander, ground cumin. Just throw in a few shakes of each. I also added a handful of fresh mint and fresh cilantro near the end. With these modifications and a big bowl of rice for the sauce, it was excellent. I will try next time adding in cooked broccoli and potato at the end. For a quick curry, no complaints.

This was really great. I chopped up the serranos and simmered the sauce a little longer than it said. I used scallops instead of shrimp and served this over basmati rice. It tasted just like a meal I got at a Thai restaurant recently. I will definitely make this again.

I tried this receipe because of all the postitive reviews (except for the one to Micahel from a very grumpy Canadian.) I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. I followed it to the letter but didn't care for the taste so I threw in a heaping Tbsp. of pureed garlic, about 3/4 cup 35% cream, a heaping Tbsp. of Patak's Mild Curry paste and about 1/2 tsp. sweetner. It was then delicious but seems like a lot of changes to a receipe. PS Not all Canadians are grumpy.

Had the leftovers for lunch today. Even better. This was nice and simple and quite good. Don't give up on the sauce too soon. Mine needed more than the stated time for the sauce to thicken and the flavors to concentrate.

It is tasty and simple. I used half cup water instead of a full cup in the curry sauce. I spiced the shrimp the way we like and sauteed it with a little of the olive oil and 1/2 cup dry white wine. And then mixed it together. I boiled couscous in chicken broth instead of making the rice. We enjoyed it and would make it again sometime.

A girlfriend and I got together to try this recipe. We got a little chatty and had a little wine, (which sounds like some of you might try:) ).. we cut down on the water and accidently chopped the peppers! The sauce was a little thin but MAN-o-MAN! It was tasty!

Rating: 3
Despite the silliness of some of the comments below, this is a simple, delicious curry which van easily be prepared in 30 minutes. Depending on your taste and those who you are serving it to, it may be a bit bland. But it is so easy to simply adjust the amount of curry powder or chile. I plan to increase both when i make it again. My wife is not fond of the texture of onions, so the use of the food processor is a big plus for us. I agree the sauce is a tad thin. But it's still delicious served over rice with fresh scallion and some chutney.

I know that there are a lot of reviews for this recipe, but I want to add that I found it a delicious, simple dish. Like many other reviewers, I added only 1/2 cup of water, and I boiled down the sauce to thicken it. I had some roasted poblano peppers in my freeser, and they added a nice kick to the sauce. Also, I broke all the rules and added some Thai fish sauce, which gave it some needed depth. I will certainly make it again.

Good base recipe to play with and adjust to your own taste. Isn't that what home cooking is all about? I love getting suggestions from some of the reviewers. Sometimes just simply additions that a tired end of the workday cook might not think of. Thanks to those of you with helpful suggestions and descriptions. To you other negative bores. Walk away from the computer and back to the stove. I can't believe how self righteous and snobby some of these reviewers are. If you didn't like it fine - just say so, but to jump on other people about their opinions... well I do find you amusing and I'm glad you live elsewhere !!!

One word: Delicious! Great combination of flavors. I did not use all the water called for in the recipe, as I felt it would have made the sauce too thin. Next time I'll sprinkle some shredded coconut over the top.

I made this for two with a little more than half a pound of shrimp but the full sauce--better too much than too little. Next time I might try leaving the water out to make it thicker, although it was very flavorable. Served it with basmati rice and a side dish of bok choy from THE GOURMET COOKBOOK, using baby bok choy, flavored with soy sauce and oyster sauce. Perfect and easy accompaniment.

This recipe was pretty good. I cut it in half, but used the entire can of coconut milk and no water. Even cooking it for awhile, it was still a little runny (but that's what the rice is for, right?). For some reason, I've never been that keen on shrimp in runny sauces (although my husband liked it) so next time I will try adding some cooked chicken instead.

I've been looking for an easy curry recipes for a long time and found it with this. I did add veggies - green and red pepper and frozen peas - and am very glad I did. I'm thinking fresh basil for next time. I lost my chile in the frig and didn't have curry powder so I used curry paste and added red pepper flakes for the hot factor. It was great.

Rating: 4
I decided to alter the recipe to make it vegetarian, so I used eggplant and mushrooms in place of the shrimp. I cubed the eggplant into bigger chunks so it wouldn't cook down too much, and I threw them in after cooking the onion/ginger mix for about five minutes. It worked absolutely beautifully (though I'm anxious to try it with shrimp to compare at some point). I also substituted a little cayenne for the chilis--I'm a wimp with no problem admitting it! I wish I had had more than one small lime, because I love the brightness that it adds to the flavor, but I just can't express how much I liked my version of the dish! I wish I had followed the advice of one of the previous commenters about using less water, but I kinda freaked when I put the coconut milk in because it was sort of a solid blop, so I threw in the other half cup of water. Well, it was absolutely no big deal - it dissolved right away. I cooked it longer to thicken it and to finish cooking the veggies. Try it - it is a great concept, even if you play with the ingredients like I did! Happy Eating!

Well we don't consider ourselves "unadventurous" eaters or cooks so sorry if this wasn't sophisticated enough for some of you guys but we loved it. It was pretty fast (some of us work kinda late) and VERY tasty for what it is. We'll definately make this again; maybe half-and-half with shrimp and scallops. I DID use low-fat coconut milk because I already had some on hand and it was fine; I did 'cheat' with a little cornstarch to thicken a tiny bit. Also we didn't feel like an extra trip to the store for chilis so we added dried red pepper bits and it gave it just enough bite.

To cook from Canada: I think we need MORE "inane and senseless" comments on this website. If all we did was talk about the food, then this is the last place I'd come. As a French-trained chef, I find most of the "serious" commentary on this site to be nothing but a display of misinformed attempts at "culinay one-upsmanship," most likely perpetrated by a bunch of pretentious, foodie-wannabe hacks. I only read the comments looking for someone who can "bring the funny." Who really cares if "my 10-year old loved it!" or whether "this one's a real keeper!" Most people can read a recipe and evaluate it themselves, rather than relying on the opinions of a bunch of strangers, and how many forks they gave it!

This is a good/basic, quick/easy and relatively mild shrimp curry that works well for a weeknight supper when time is at a premium, and also for those with less adventurous palates, or those who are new to making curries. When it comes to curry and the degree of heat, each to his own and there is nothing wrong with that! This recipe may be easily adapted/spiced up according to your individual tastes. Although I did enjoy this, I have far better recipes, so won't be making this one again. To the cook from Sacratomato: Your post is a big put-on and a very sad/feeble attempt at comedy. With all those unappetizing changes, you were not even close to the basic premise of this recipe and definitely made no viable suggestions. Obviously, you did not make this dish. So, why bother rating/commenting on it at all? Perhaps, you only wanted to see your lame/sarcastic words in type? I have nothing against a little tongue-in-cheek humour, but your comments do not even register on the funny scale! Your statement, "I will use this on my family..." almost sounds like a threat or a form of punishment. PLEASE, spare us your theatrics and find a different venue for your immature sense of humour. To the cook from Chicago: Ditto the above! Such a poor decision to ride on another's tattered coattails! To the rest of you: I apologize for my rant. I am usually able to ignore or take these kinds of senseless/inane posts in stride. However, they seem to be increasing with considerable frequency and these two pushed me beyond "put up and shut up"! Where are the site moderators???

ok, i didn't really have any shrimp, so i used tofu, left over from when my girlfriend left me last week. stuff takes on any flavor, right? didn't have any shrimp buillion, so i used chicken. didn't have any limes, onion, or curry powder, either, but i used some Grandma's Famous Chili Powder. seemed to do the trick. i did find an undrunk marguerita in the fridge. didn't notice the lipstick on the rim until after i put it in. oh, well. no coconut milk either, but i did have a potato. i put it in the blender on high and about 10 minutes later the blender started smoking. i turnied it off and, i gotta tell you, it DID smell sorta like coconuts. anyway, i must say that this whole dish is awesome! i will use this on my family over and over....

The recipe I'm referring to includes Kaffir lime leaves that another reviewer added in addition to Thai basil. A real knock-out!!!
