I made this last night for dinner and both my hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Since it's cold outside, I changed the grilling portion. I lightly coated the veal with flour seasoned with salt and pepper, and sauteed the cutlets in a nonstick pan. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit.

I added about 2 Tbs capers to the sauce. We really enjoyed it.

I agree - quite bland, unless of course, you make it this way: This sauce is amazing!!! I used a rose leftover since I didn't have any white that I wanted to use ($29./bottle a little much).. I Used Tastes like Chicken flavor to make the buillion, and used a couple of T/flour and 4 T/water...Also sauteed cipolinni e shallots in a little oil with garlic in the oiled cast iron pan for the veal. Removed once browned, before adding the floured/s&p'ed veal and added this onion/garlic mixto the sauce at the last minute. This was amazing!!!! Used my little T. pasta from Milan.

This recipe was really bland. The sauce was completely non-descript. I had my reservations when no garlic or onions were called for but thought ok, let's try it. FAIL. Will continue looking for a different piccata sauce.

This is not a real Piccata recipe. This is essentially an uncooked white sauce recipe. Piccata is made from frond left over from sauteing floured cutlets in oil which is then deglazed with wine, stock, lemon juice, with the addition of parsley and capers, then reduced and finished with butter. tsk tsk Gourmet magazine.

An excellent recipe for either veal or my veal(less) friends - chicken. Quick - easy - and nice presentation. You need crusty bread to sop up that last bit of remaining sauce on the plate!!!

I'm really surprised at the good rating this dish got. I made it last night with chicken instead of veal. The sauce was very bland. The noodles accompanying the dish were very good.

I personally think that this recipe was easy to make and delicious! I am only a young teenager and I was able to make this for fathers day, and let me tell you, everyone enjoyed it! It goes really nicely with the noodles they recommend and some sauted mushrooms.

No! Don't use roux for Veal Piccata; it's a white wine reduction finished with butter. Capers are excellent, but it becomes lemon caper buerre blanc.

Rating: 3
Very good, made with chicken. Even the husband (beef guy) liked it -- a lot. Followed the sauce ingredients & proportions, but added 2 Tblsp. of capers at the end with the parsely. Although I realize this is marked as a low-fat recipe I couldn't resist the following: when veal/chicken is done in the pan, toss the sauce into the fry pan and add 2 Tblsp. water for 30 seconds & deglaze. It gave the sauce a nice golden color and added a lot to the flavor.

A family favorite I make over and over. If I don't have veal, I use chicken breasts or pork tenderloin pounded to very thin cutlets. Delicious!

Sauted the veal in a butter/olive oil combo after treating with an egg, milk, flour, bread crumb bath. The veal was yummy. Added mushrooms to the juices to pre-cook and left in the sauce which I doubled. Delicious outcome. Will do again!

Fairly simple to prepare, but delicious. A nice, lighter alternative to the heavier versions with flour coatings. The grill marks on the veal and lemon make a nice presentation too.

Listent to Bethesda. He/she knows what he/she's talking about. Dust the veal with flour and saute in butter. Deglaze with white wine, chix broth, lemon juice and capers. Add some parsely. YUM.

As-is, nothing special. I use this recipe as a starting point but it's an excellent starting point so I've given it 3 forks. I prefer chicken to veal, but you know, whatever floats your boat. I pound the chicken, dip in beaten egg, then coat with panko. Now I make this recipe pretty much the way it says, only OF COURSE YOU NEED CAPERS. My wife LOVES this recipe - wonnerful!

I found this recipe to be quite bland. While I agree that most piccata recipes are quite similar (and easy), this turned out average at best. There's better out there.

I've used a lot of piccata recipes, they don't vary too much (it's a classic). I happened to want to do something a bit more sophisticated this time when I referenced this recipe, and added capers and prosciutto. It was excellent. we also like to add a little cornstarch w/ water to thicken, because we love to serve over pasta and have a thicker sauce.

Rating: 3
I too added bread crumbs to the cutlets and my family thought it was wonderful. I will make this again soon.

What an excellent way to prepare veal piccata! Using the grill pan ensures quickly browning the meat without drying it out. I made double the sauce and served it over angel hair pasta. Delicious! A green salad and crusty bread to soak up the sauce rounded out the meal nicely.

I have made this a number of times, very easy and for my wife who prefers to not eat veal I use chicken, one pan, two different dinners.

This dish was so delicious.I would definately make it again. But I would really recomend also serving some kind of vegetable like corn.

Perhaps I did it wrong? When you add the flour/water to the sauce is it supposed to bubble like a wittch's cauldron? Otherr than that, a fine recipe

Rating: 4
Well I Didn't use neither veal nor chicken, I substituted for Pork Tenderloin Madallions. I first pounded each madallion about 1/8 inch thick, and seasoned them with freshly cracked black pepper from the mill and kosher salt, dusted them in flour sauteed them in butter "let it simmer for a few minutes before adding your lemon juice and white wine and then I added capers aswell for the last finishing touches before transferring to platter! To easy to screw up...Terrific Stuff!

Rating: 3
DELICIOUS!!! Made some changes, as in adding flour to meat after browning, redusing the sauce, then returning floured meat to pan to warm through and thicken. very tasty with the buttered noodles as suggested, and with green beans with toasted almonds. Chardonnay was a great addition to the meal.

My botfriend took me to his favorite resturaunt for dinner the other evening.I had this amazing Garbarone Limon (I think that was what it was called.LOL) Basically it was a shrimp"piccata" with some garlic and sauteed squash, it was absolutely amazing had to make it for myself at home. The piccata sauce recipe with this dish was exquisite and so easy to alter and make for my dish. Definitely will use this recipe again, and again!!!

This recipie has become one of our favorites. I make it quite often since my husband always requests it. I have to admit though I ussually use chicken since we are not big veal eaters. A definite suggestion for any occasion. and so easy to make

Rating: 3
We also added capers and garlic, and lightly dusted the veal with flour before adding to the pan instead of adding the flour to the sauce. And your veal will get more tender if you soak in milk. Lovely flavored dish, the lemon and capers and veal and the rest. One of my favorites and this recipe is a good one with our alterations.

Excellent Recipe, however I like to add Capers, fresh Garlic, and crushed chili peppers to the sauce.

Rating: 2
Very nice, simple dish. On the advice of an Italian friend (whose mother makes veal frequently)I let the veal sit overnight in half-and-half to supposedly make it extra tender (and it was!). Not overly special but very nice and a good dinner if you need something to serve to a less adventurous friend.

I am not rating this recipe as i really did not follow it. I used the same ingredients but used the technique from Cook's Illustrated recipe for chicken piccata. It is in their magazine and their Italian cookbook. I don't care for uncooked (essentially) flour sauces. I much prefer to lightly flour the veal before sauteeing and then quickly reduce the wine and chicken broth in the pan after sauteeing shallot and the lemon slices and finally enriching with a bit of butter. Don't skip the lemon slices. Along with capers they add the needed zip for a very tasty dish and they make a lovely garnish for presentation..

Rating: 4
I've made this with veal and with turkey cutlets. It is a wonderful recipe. I would, however, highly reccomend deglazing the pan in which the meat was cooked, with the sauce. It makes the sauce a wonderful brown color and adds great flavor. Of course I did add capers and some garlic, other that that I made the recipe pretty much as written.

This was great - and very easy to make. A good dish for during the week but delicious enough to serve to guests on the weekend.

This is a classic dish which my mother (of Italian descent) used to make. I dredged the veal cutlets in flour before cooking, which I think is pretty standard picatta technique. Other than that, I followed the recipe. A fast, easy dish that is perfect for a dinner during the work week.

I used chicken and a tip from a chef friend of mine that i really like. What you do is take 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons pecorino or romano, and four tablespoons of chopped parsley. In a bowl stir the cheese and parsley in with the well beaten eggs. Then dip the cutlet(salt & pepper them first) into this mixture, dredge in flour and lightly fry in a little oil (i used olive) it is so fantastic. Adds a very good flavor to the cutlet.

I was looking for a fast receipe for a last minute dinner party. I used chicken breasts I had on hand instead of veal. It turned out wonderfully, very flavorful and satisfying. I didn't even notice until later that it was low in fat. It was rich and delicious.

This was very good! The only thing that I was concerned about was that my veal looked grey after cooking it. Overall, the flavor was very good. I made it with the chive noodles, which were yummy.

Just a tip to anyone considering a veal piccata dish - also check out Bon Apetite's "Instant Veal Piccata" and "Piccata with Pinenuts and Capers" and then read the reviews until you find one that is compatible with your tastebuds & pantry. I made the veal piccata by adopting many of the reviewer's tips (capers, sauce made from the veal, dusting of flour). Still a very simple dish -and I'm excited to try some modifications.

Enjoyed this recipe very much.. The lemon adds just enough flavor and is not overwhelming, like some piccata dishes. Would definitely make again!

I ran across this recipe and decided to try it because piccata recipes are so quick and easy. After reading all the reviews I did a little doctoring. I made a full recipe of the sauce and 2/3 pound of the veal for 2 people. I prepared the sauce, then pan seared 'flour-dusted' veal scallops. I added 1 T. unsalted butter to the pan and sauteed 1 T. minced shallots + 1/2 tsp. minced garlic. I used a little fresh lemon juice to deglaze the pan and stir up the brown bits. Then I added the thinly sliced lemon to the pan and then the sauce to reheat. I finished by adding 1 tsp. capers and the chopped parsley. The flavor was EXCELLENT and the consistency was perfect! I did not give this 4 forks because of the changes I made which the recipe needs to give it flavor. We had leftover sauce but I do suggest doubling it if you're serving 8 people. 3/4 cup for 8 people is not a lot!! I served this with brown & wild rice and Roasted Tomatoes with Shallots and Herbs - Cooking Light 1/2002.

Agree with the "caper theory". Excuse the pun! Easier and quicker - cheaters method. Use one packet Chicken Gravy Mix. (One packet only 80 calories total!) Add the lemon, wine, and capers to taste. Throw in a can of artichokes and/or mushrooms (canned or fresh). Mmmmmmmuch Better!

I make chicken picatta - MUST use capers! Rochester, I agree with you about the cream, but whadya got against capers?? Only about 10 calories per tablespoon, no fat, bless their delicious little hearts. Like garlic and lemon, they are a guilt-free requirement for this dish!

Looks like we're narrowing in on the truth. Salt and pepper veal then dust with flour. Saute 2 minutes in butter and remove. Deglaze pan with white wine, add broth and reduce, add lemon juice and capers. Add veal and accumulated juices back into pan for 2 minutes, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.

Simplicity -- I want Veal Piccata -- not stew! A must, however, is the lemon, wine and CAPERS! And, for me, the sauce must be made in the skillet after the veal is prepared. Ah! Delicious!

Rating: 2
To make life easier, and maximize flavour, make the sauce in the same skillet as the veal. Deglaze with a cup of wine and 1/2 cup of veal stock. Reduce by half and then add a little heavy cream, and a good pinch of lemon zest. All you have to do now, is decided when to add the capers - a must for this dish.

IAF, I agree wholeheartedly. There is so much emphasis these days on adding more ingredients than necessary...I blame this on one particular TV chef. Italian food is about simplicity...enjoying a few, fresh tasteful ingredients, combined for a dish that doesn't attack your tastebuds.

I haven't prepared this recipe but wanted to comment on the numerous reviews which suggested onions, garlic and the kitchen sink. This may result in a good dish but it is not veal piccata, which is simply veal (perhaps lightly floured) sauteed with a sauce made with pan drippings, lemon and parsley.

Tried this on a work night and was surprised that it was so quick and very good. I did however add a little onion, mushrooms, and garlic to the sauce. Was this defeating the low fat "premise" of the dish? Don't care, it was great.

I think this recipe is good, However I would do similar suggestions. Lightly flour the veal or chicken before browning and after you saute, cook some shallots and deglaze pan with your broth and wine and then add some flour or cornstarch if needed to thicken a bit. Should be very thin consistency. Capers are a must

Rating: 3
This recipe is good, but the addition of garlic and onions is essential as suggested by another rater. Also, Picatta in my mind has to have some capers in it. I did all these things and it turned out very good.

Instead of making the sauce in a saucepan, I used the same skillet as the veal. Add some shallots, 1 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of beef stock. Let it reduce by half and add some heavy cream, 1 tablespoon of lemon zest, and 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. PERFECT.

Very easy and good. The sauce was much better once it thickened a bit. The sauce should have started with garlic and a bit of onion.
