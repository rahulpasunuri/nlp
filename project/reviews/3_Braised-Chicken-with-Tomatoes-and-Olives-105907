Don't bother; make the other "braised chicken with tomatoes and olives" recipe that is on this site.

It's a good, basic recipe for a simple meal, but I followed the recipe as written & the chicken came out still bloody inside. I'd double the cooking time once you add the chicken to the tomato olive mixture.

Loved it! It was so easy to make: the only thing I changed was to bake rather than fry the meat so it is not heavy:)) The combination with the spagettini was a great idea too (if you could get them fresh made rather than packaged it will be much better)

Very good. I made it as written, but after tasting it I added a very large handful of minced, fresh basil which really added a lovely flavor. I will make it again, but only with the addition of the fresh basil.

I really enjoyed this recipe, in large part because I used it as a base to which I added some favorite ingredients. As many chefs have noted, isn't that the fun in cooking anyway?! Some suggestions--add 1-2 sliced shallots to the onion mix, extra garlic (which is always good), a bit of oregano and lots of cracked pepper to the tomato puree, and roughly 3/4 of a hearty red like Pinot Noir to the pot before simmering. The result: a rich, hearty sauce and tender chicken thighs. Yum! Will definitely make again--was great as leftovers too.

It was so delicious that I am making it for the second time today! I added a little basil & oregano as suggested by others. Also, added a few drops of yellow food coloring to the hot olive oil used to brown the chicken, in order to enhance the browning process. Gives a nicer & more even brownish color.. Also, I braised it for 40 minutes.

This recipe, as written, is quite boring. If you add red or white wine, some tomato paste, and a lot more herbs (thyme, basil, and/or oregano) and more olives, then it's interesting -- but then you've got a whole different dish.

With a some white wine and a bit of extra time simmering this recipe was a winner!

This was easy and very tasty, well liked by the whole family. The leftovers were even better than the original dinner; I think the flavors married in a more interesting way. I added white wine to the sauce. I also used bone-in breasts as well as thigh and leg pieces; the sauce is a bit strong for breasts, but the meat was very succulent.

Having read all the reviews advising that the sauce needed to be "jazzed up", I didn't even try the original but added white wine, tomato paste and oregano. The result was fine, nothing special, until paired with the spaghettini with lemon and garlic, a spectacular pasta accompaniment. I will commit the pasta tomemory but serve it next time serve with different Italian tomatoe-sauced chicken dish.

I disagree with the previous reviewer--I think that the sauce was very flavorful. HOWEVER, I did double the amount of olives and did add a bit more thyme. I also thickened the sauce by simmering it, uncovered, for about 15-20 minutes to concentrate the flavors. The chicken remained tender and absorbed flavor from the sauce. I made it for some friends and we all loved it.

I really enjoyed this simple recipe. Took the previous reviewers tip and deglazed the pan after sauteeing the onion and garlic with 1/4 cup of red wine and used skinless boneless chicken thighs to cut back on the fat. I also used 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried Italian herbs in lieu of the fresh thyme

OK, so the best thing about this recipe is that its supposed to be served with spaghetti with garlic and lemon (an amazing combo, belive me), but the way this chicken dish tastes if made according to the recipe given here, I can't possibly think of anyone wanting to duplicate it exactly. The problem is that its way too bland (for my tastes, anyway) and the recipe doesn't give enough time for the ingredients to reduce or simmer down to a thicker consistency (or perhaps the intent was that it shouldn't!!). In any case, what you end up with is a simple sauce - something that you would have thrown together anyway even without the help of this recipe. Still, the combination of ingredients is delightful. However, a recipe like this one seems to be crying out 'Better me!' or in common parlance, 'Make me better!'. Add some wine to it and let it reduce - it gives it a great taste. Also, if you can chicken giblets to the sauce (try frying chicken livers first, and then pureeing it with chicken stock, and then adding it to the sauce) it makes a world of a difference. In any case, I personally thought that such a recipe would force me to throw in my own ingredients, which is a great thing when it comes down to it!
