This recipe is fabulous. The vanilla beans make the taste almost elegant and the specks are a nice touch. I think next year I will make two. Mine was gone because it was so delicious.

I found this cake to be a bit too sweet, and the chiffon texture was so light and airy that it seemed to collapse into nothingness as you ate it--evryone took seconds because the "firsts" only amounted to a few bites, so the whole cake (which I served with strawberries instead of sorbet) only served six people! Next year I'll go back to the tried and true Manischewitz Passover sponge cake recipe, also made in a tube pan. It has more substance (though isn't heavy), a richer, less sweet flavor, and it serves a huge number of people.

Great recipe. Made it yesterday for tomorrow's seder and my family has already eaten it! Will have to make another one. To the reader who substituted vanilla extract for the beans - The reason most people would use the vanilla beans is that the extract isn't kosher for passover. Enjoy this one!

This is my all time favorite Passover cake recipe. It is so good that I would almost make it during the year. But I have made a change in the recipe. Instead of grinding a vanilla bean with sugar, I use 1 Tbl vanilla extract added when I beat the egg yolks. All the sugar is then added at the same time. My neighbor recommended this recipe with the substitution and I thank her every year.

A delicious cake with vanilla specks. Beats the pants off Passover sponge cake! Almost like a heartier angel food cake. If you don't have time for sorbet I recommend strawberries and non dairy topping.

To answer the other reviewer, almost all Passover sponge cakes and tortes do not use the yolks, only the whites. Using the yolks would not make the cake rise as high. You can freeze the yolks for another recipe.

Your recipe has a missing line!!!! You fail to mention where the egg yolks go.
