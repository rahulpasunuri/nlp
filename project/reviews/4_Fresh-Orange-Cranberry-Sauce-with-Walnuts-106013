Delicious! Used a 10 oz. bag frozen cranberries, 1/2 cup agave nectar instead of sugar. A pinch of cinnamon and tiny pinch of allspice. Will serve with Ham and Turkey.

I have made this recipe for ten years now, and made some adjustments along the way. I have found I have needed to double the recipe as it is a crowd pleaser and wonderful in turkey ciabatta sandwiches the next day. It is a little to sweet for my taste so if I am doubling the recipe - reduce sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Also I add 1 Tbsp freshly minced ginger for additional spice. Use fresh orange or tangerine juice if it is available. I usually top it off with a cinnamon stick resting on top of the sauce. Add 2 Tbsp Grand Marnier once cooled.

Have made this for the last several years to rave reviews. What we don't eat on the holiday is added to fruit cup the following morning, even more rave reviews.

Delicious! A nice blend of tart (I make it with 2/3 cup sugar) and sweet, raw and cooked fruit, smooth and crunchy. A Thanksgiving standard.

Fantastic! I made this exactly as the recipe instructed and it was a hit. It was a WONDERFUL accompaniment to Ina Garten's Herb-Roasted Turkey Breast for the Thanksgiving feast. I make it year after year and everyone loves it. My 10 year old nephew said to his mom one year, "Hey, Mom you should try this, it's really good."

Absolutely love this recipe! I used two cups orange juice for two bags of cranberries, 1 3/4 cup sugar, the zest of a whole orange plus sliced up the orange minus the pilth. Added 1 tsb fresh ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp ground cloves. Topped it off with 2 tsb Grand Marnier. Fantastic!

This recipe is a hit every year for Thanksgiving! Instead of regular oranges I use mandarin oranges and omit the nuts and my family loves it!

I have made this recipe so many times.. super easy AND delicious. Like others I reduced the sugar. I'm making it tonight because it's good anytime of year. PW

I tried the recipe but didn't cook it since we like the fresh taste of uncooked fruit. Very easy too for those who don't have time. Total prep time 10 minutes. I didn't toast the walnuts. Superfined the sugar in the cuisinart first then pulsed the other ingredients with a tablespoon of Grand Marnier and a pinch of cinnamon until minced and mixed.. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and 1/2 cup orange juice. It sat over night and was incredible.

This has become the traditional cranberry sauce at our family Thanksgiving. Super easy and so yummy! The orange really works so well with the cranberries.

really simple and good recipe. I only added 3/4 cup sugar but still was sweet. Maybe the orange juice I used was sweeter. I also added about a teaspoon of grated ginger, something I learned from a Ming Tsai recipe of cranberry sauce.

This is my new cranberry sauce recipe! I added twice as many toasted walnuts because I love the way they taste!I also added just a pinch of ground cloves. So Yummy!

I will certainly make this again. Followed as writtn, this recipe comes out very sweet. Next time I will try reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup to make a tangy-er sauce. Very easy to make.

This was a wonderful change for our thanksgiving table. it was a bit on the tart side so those who usually dont eat cranberry sause still didnt.

After reading the reviews, I went out and bought a small bottle of Grand Manier and forgot to put it into the dish!! As a result, I thought it had a "citrusy" taste to it rather than the tart cranberry taste that I love. It was certainly very good but wanted a depth of flavor that came with the addition of the liquer. Oh well, there's always Christmas! Definitely a keeper though.

Fantastic!! My husband's mom used to make cranberry orange sauce and he wanted me to try and make some. I found this recipe. I made half a batch omitting the nuts since no one eats a lot of sauce. Everyone raved about this and my husband said it was the best he has ever had. There was none left, so I had to make another batch the next day for the leftovers.

great , easy to make , even for a first time cook. Adding the Grande Marnier a definite plus. I made it without walnuts --offered more diverstity.

i followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to use half OJ, half grand marnier, and it worked out very well. i used almonds instead of walnuts, though, since i had themon hand for another recipe.

Loved it. I used 1/2cup Splenda instead of sugar. It was perfect, will make it again for the holidays. This will be my new cranberry receipt. TOSS the old one away, this is a keeper.

Excellent cranberry sauce and sure to become my new standard recipe. Omitted the nuts, used half orange juice and half Grand Marnier, used all the zest/flesh from one large orange and decreased sugar by 1/2 cup with lovely results - not overly sweet with great texture/consistency and the liquer added another layer of flavour. A definite keeper!

This is a great recipe, and VERY easy. I left out the nuts, and it was just fine. Even my 4 year old son liked it.

Wow! When it comes to cranberry sauce I got stuck in a routine of making a "true" fresh cranberry sauce (pulsed in the processor with oranges). But this was waaaayyy better...the cooking intensifies the flavors without removing the texture. I used pecans instead of walnuts...but that's just a personal preference.

This dish is my absolute favorite way to serve cranberries. It's perfect with pork or turkey, really even by itself if you like cranberries as much as I do :)

This stuff is fantastic! I can sit and eat a whole bowl full of it, and nothing else! I used black walnuts, sort of by mistake, but they were delicious in this dish. And it's so beautiful, too. Love it!

Being a Cape Codder and a lover of cranberries I was anxious to try this recipe. It didn't disapoint! My husband is not a nut lover so I didn't add the nuts. Sure it would be a delicous addition.

It's incredible as a side dish! And it's to pork and turkey what jelly is to peanut butter.
