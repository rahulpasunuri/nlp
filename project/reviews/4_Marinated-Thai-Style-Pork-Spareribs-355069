There is nothing like great Thai ribs. And Thai ribs are nothing like the sauced American ones. I love them both, actually. About the marinade prep- if everything goes in the blender, there is really no need to do more than give a rough chop to the ingredients. Slicing a cup of shallots is hard work- I din't even chop them. They are small and grind right up in the blender. Thai cooks use a mortar and pestle, but the blender works fine.

My 12-yr old picky eater called these, "the best thing I've eaten in 3 years!" They were delicious!

Wow! These were super easy and incredibly tasty. I added a little honey for some extra sweetness, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. When I took then out of the oven I thought maybe they had burned, but they were perfect. My husband wants them again tomorrow.

These were delicious but I'd advise to marinate for the maximum amount of time. I only did it for 2 hours and they were lacking a bit of flavor

Followed directions 100% and thought these ribs were terrible. Too much Ginger and a very strange flavor.the only reason for giving one fork is because they were tender.

The only mistake I made is that I didn't make more! So LOVELY!!!

I made these ribs to take to a Super Bowl party yesterday, they were a big hit, and I will definitely be making them again. When the ribs are baking it perfumes the kitchen. As Rachael Ray says YUM OH!!

This was a very flavorful and simple marinade to make. I will definitely use it again on ribs and probably steaks

Seemed like a lot of scallions. I assume you use both green and white parts?? I did and we thought they were delicious!

I made this last night and they were delicious. I did have my supermarket butcher cut the rack as recommended in the recipe which was a time saver. After reading previous reviews, I too only baked for 1 hour which was perfect; I wouldn't go any longer. And I didn't make the dipping sauce (not needed). I served these with Spicy Thai Noodles with Ginger Peanut Dressing (a FoodNetwork recipe) and paired with a Heflrich Vin D'Alsace Pinot Gris, 2007. Delicious. This recipe is a keeper. www.WithaSouthernTwist.com

I had never cooked ribs before, but this seemed like a good recipe to try them out on. I only cooked them for about an hour instead of an hour and a half. I followed the recipe exactly. The marinade smelled so nice! The ribs turned out scrumptious! I'll make these again for sure.

I marinated the ribs a bit longer. Almost 6 hours. My husband and I enjoyed them but don't think I will be trying this recipe again. We like more of a BBQ flavor on ribs. Also I agree the cooking time can be reduced. I followed directions and ribs were slightly dry. ALSO we DID NOT like the sauce the goes with it. Tasted it and ended up throwing it out.

I couldn't get spareribs in my market, so I used a flint steak (pork) instead and cut it into sizes similar to the size of spareribs anticipated here. It was delicious. The cook time was less... more like 45 min or 1 hour. I also accidentally omitted the garlic and found it was outstanding without it. Really great marinade.

These are absolutely the best ribs I've ever had. I've made them three times in the past two months, and the experience was the same each time. Highly recommended for rib lovers!

This is relatively easy to prepare and delicious! I only marinated for an hour, but next time I will marinate overnight. There was still a lot of flavor. Did not rotate the ribs as they were cooking, and they turned out fine. Served with jasmine rice, and thai vegetable stir fry. Did not make the dipping sauce, maybe next time...

When I made the marinade it was a little bitter. I was wondering where this bitter taste was coming from (what ingredient)?? Ideas on what could be eliminated?

Very easy and tastes fantastic! Only had time to marinate ribs 1 hour before cooking, and they were still perfect.

I prepared this recipe as stated, and it was the best. I had a birthday party for my brother. I got rave reviews from all my guest. This will be a keeper.
