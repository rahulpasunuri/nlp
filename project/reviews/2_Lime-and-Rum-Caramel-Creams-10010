This tasted less of lime and more of egg yolk. I couldn't even swallow more than two bites. Very disappointing.

This was a great dessert!!The lime flavor was wonderfully fresh!!! The rum flavor was not that strong, but I did not used dark rum which was called for.I made it in a 13 by 9 inch was witha double batch of sugar for the bottom, AWESOME!!!
