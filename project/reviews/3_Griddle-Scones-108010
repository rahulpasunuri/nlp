This is a great simple recipe that works well for camping or we use it on our boat as the dry ingredients can be assembled in advance and zip-locked. I never have buttermilk and simply add a tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to regular milk and let it sit for 20 minutes before using it. This works fine every time. The secret to making great scones is to handle them minimally (don't knead them too much)and to not disturb them while cooking. The more you handle them, the less fluffy they will be. One reviewer said they didn't have much taste, but she had substituted canola for the butter. I would suggest there is a correlation there. This basic recipe has an infinite number of variations. We add currents, raisons or dried cranberries with white chocolate chips and I'm sure there are no end of possibilities. These base recipe goes great with homemade jam and Devon cream. There is also no need to use butter or vegetable oil for cooking, as they cook beautifully in a dry cast iron frying pan on medium heat. Do not turn them too early, you can tell when to turn them as they will start to puff up a bit. A quick peak to see if that they are not burning helps as well.

This is a great rustic breakfast item...it is basic...which is good as it is a tasty platform to add butter or jam to. Very simple to make and will travel well. We are thinking about using it with a chicken soup...more like a biscuit than a scone really. Overall, very pleased

just made these at the cottage for dinner, used some for an accompaniment to the main course and some under strawberries and white chocholate pudding for dessert. The buttermilk really made them fulffy. I did not knead or roll, I dropped from spoon into cast iron pan. Did not need to use too much oil in the pan, just a bit with the first load and then they were fine, They were a hit. I did not have buttermilk, so used skim milk with 2 Tbsp. vinegar in it and mixed up and let sit, I also used canola oil instead of butter. I just read some of the reviews, I agree they are bland, but if you cook at all, and read the recipe ahead of time, you know they will be plain. If I wanted to jazz up for a dinner scone, I would add some more salt and some fresh or dried herbs maybe some dill and chive. For dessert scone, I may add lemon zest and some sugar. But, for what the recipe is, they are very tasty, everyone liked the browned crust and my husband and son ate them as they were without even buttering them. They are also a great cottage recipe as we have not totally stocked everything up for the season yet and are working on what I remembered to bring up in the cooler and the basics (flour, salt, oil, vinegar etc.) that I already had up here.

This is a staple at our house. My 5 year old insisted that we add some mini-chocolate chips (about 1/4 cup), yummy.

Bland, indeed, they're totally tasteless! I followed the instructions to the letter and these are just little flour platforms for jam and butter. You will need the maple syrup and the rest because these don't taste like anything except flour. Even adding raisins didn't make them any tastier. There are definitely better scone recipes out there.

Quite good. I had to keep them on the griddle for quite some time longer than estimated -- I think my range is a bit weak, though. I also might have made them too thick -- I wouldn't recommend exceeding the 1/2" thickness. Very buttery -- great with jam. Devonshire cream would make them heavenly, but might be a little much after the 1/2 stick of butter.

These scones are so easy once you learn to make them. They taste wonderful and everyone in the family loves them. We have them weekend mornings and sometimes for dinner. Important to follow directions.

not sure what might have gone wrong...but it's a for sure that this recipe was a loser at my house. double checked ingredient list and i am sure i followed it to a tee. non-descript and bland...that was the vote from the entire household.

This makes for good eating. It's not too sweet as it is, but you can spruce it up with raisins, currants, cinnamon, brown sugar, etc. You can also use milk, soy milk, or sour cream instead of buttermilk.

I was so excited to see this recipe. My uncle use to make his "fried biscuits" for us on Sunday mornings. Unfortuntly, he passed away many years ago and never wrote down the recipe, I'm pretty sure he didn't use cream of tartar. These are great served warm with butter and maple syrup. Thanks for this blast from the past.
