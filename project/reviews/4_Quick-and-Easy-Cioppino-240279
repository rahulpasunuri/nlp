Just made the recipe as written. Taste: not too bad. What threw me was its appearance. The red wine turned the whole thing an odd shade of purple...quite unappetizing. If I choose to try this again, will definitely use white wine instead.

This was so good my husband asked that I add it to the household repertoire. Followed the recipe without any alterations; quick, easy and wonderful on a winter week night.

i made this for new years eve last night and i was very disappointed...there was no flavor. i followed the instructions and i even let it simmer (w/out the fish) for 3 hrs to try and build flavor in the broth. i was so suprised after all of the rave reviews. i used cod, shrimp & clams. my friend from italy said he would have added 3-4x the amount of clam juice and possible some seafood stock.

We enjoy this dish frequently. Quick, fresh, and tasty. You can adjust ingredients to suit any taste. You want crab? Add crab! You want to use a cheap merlot instead of a bold zinfandel? Go ahead! This recipe abides. Whatever you do, be sure to serve crusty bread and butter alongside. Herb Caen described his ideal San Francisco lunch thusly: "A bowl of cioppino, fresh sourdough and butter, a glass of chablis, and take the afternoon off." Amen, Mr. Caen.

We used small clams in place of mussels and basil in place of dried thyme. We used a feisty Bourgogne Red. It was still excellent.

Gotta with agree with StevyD...where's the CRAB!?

I understand that names no longer mean anything and that Clam Sauce can now be made with Reindeer meat and still be called Clam Sauce. Yet in my family, ever since they arrived in San Francisco from Genoa, Italy in 1904, the cioppino we've always made was based on crab. Live Dungeness crabs from the Bay or nearby. Shrimp was alway present along with chunks of fish, and from there other seafood items were occasionally added but only rarely. For my family and many others, without crab, it's fish stew (Cacciucco maybe) but not cioppino.

fennel flavor mysterious, elusive, not obvious- perfumed the kitchen---quick, easy, healthy and delicious! i used a frozen medley of shellfish--mussels, octopus, calamari, shrimp and clams, and muir's organic canned tomato products for better flavor--oregano instead of thyme and skipped the clam juice this time---OMG this is sooo good, fresh and bright!

Good - I would thinly slice the onion and fennel instead of processing it, and double the red pepper next time. We love our cioppino here in SF and this is a good base for a quick version. Definitely serve with a simple salad and crusty fresh sourdough.

Really easy and quick cioppino recipe. Doubled the garlic and added 1/2 lb. of shrimp; used hake for the fish. Served with a salad and crusty rosemary bread. Everyone enjoyed it, so will definitely make again!

was ok. Not great at all. You can deffinately taste that this is a "quick" Cioppino. Does not have the depth and flavor a real Cioppino should. But with a bunch of fresh sea food you can't go totally wrong.

This was awesome. Very easy, and surprisingly good. I think I added a bit more than 1/8 t of red pepper and it had a great, light kick. Also, I used 3/4 c of mussels, clams, shrimp and scallops. Highly recommend!

This was great! Only reason I didn't give it a 4 was because I changed quite a few things. First off, I chopped up about 3 bell peppers, grated a medium onion, and used 2 tsp of whole fennel seed. Cooked that with 1/2 tsp Aleppo pepper flakes and an additional bay leaf. Skimped on the black pepper. I left out the water, drained juice from 2 6-oz cans of clams (Trader Joe's) and 1 6-oz can of crab meat (ditto). It comes out to about 10 oz of juice. I evenly chopped about 1/2 pound of Gulf shrimp and quartered 8 sea scallops. Added to the pot which simmered for about 40 minutes (to develop the flavor better, plus I was busy peeling and deveining shrimp haha) and cooked for about 2 minutes, then turned on the pot, added the two drained cans of clams and the can of crab meat (it doesn't give you lots of chunks, but it gives a nice flavor and makes it more like a stew, which I like). Overall, very delicious. This was incredibly filling, though, which is definitely due to how much seafood I put in!

Rating: 4
Very delish! I skipped the fennel as I'm not a fan and added julienned bell peppers and zucchini. I used shrimp, scallops, and haddock....very tasty and quick. Make sure to serve with an extra large loaf of crusty bread because the bread is a fantastic way to sop up the broth.

Rating: 4
Add me to the list of fans of this recipe. Is it the best Cioppino I've ever tasted? No. But it IS dinner- party-worthy and sooooooo easy you can sit down and enjoy your guests as they arrive. Easy to prepare to the point you add seafood beforehand; take 5-6 minutes to finish & serve. I also used the Costco seaford combo, plus cod, since that was what was available. Halibut would definitely be better. I served Asparagus w/Serrano Ham as the salad course, lots of good bread with the soup and Honeydew Melon in coconut Milk for dessert. Raves all around.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used a seafood combination sold at Costco that includes shrimp, mussels, scallops, and calamari rings. I think the broth would have been better had I used fish as well, but it still was delicious.

This was delicious. I made it for my husband tonight for our third anniversary. I needed a quick after-work meal that would be impressive and yummy. Here are the changes I made based on other recipes and what was on hand: I added two green bell peppers, doubled the garlic, added 1 lb. chopped fresh tomatoes (since they are in season), substituted 1 1/2 cups dry white wine for red, and used 2 lbs. total of combined fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, halibut, and jarred crab meat. The only thing I didn't like was the jarred crab meat I used -- it made the dish a bit too salty and the soup seemed too thick and stewy. Next time I will skip it or use fresh crab in the shell.

I used TJ's mahi mahi and calamari instead of mussels. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. If I was to make any changes it would be to saute the fennel and onions an extra 15 minutes. This is a very good recipe and I will make it again.

Loved this. I didn't have fennel or mussels so I used shrimp, red snapper and calamari and sauteed the seafood before I put it in the soup. Would use more seafood. It was a light soup and I will include it in my summer meal rotation.

Super easy and quick to make with lots of flavor! Doubled the amount of red pepper for some extra kick. Used Shrimp, Clams, Bay Scallops and Calamari. Scallops changed the color so wouldn't use them again.

We just finished dinner and loved this dish. The only change was we added extra garlic and large onion and instead of fish we use mussels, bay scallops and precooked shrimp. It was all really good but we agreed that I would use more seafood than what's called for. VERY easy, I made this in about 10 minutes and then had time for a glass of wine before it was ready.

Delicious and simple! I used squid, scallops and clams - added clams first for ~6 mins, then squid with the scallops for ~6 more mins and all were cooked perfectly. Grocery store didn't have clam juice so I used seafood stock instead. Also I used san maranzano tomatoes. Fiance and I though the stew itself could've used more flavor on day 1, but was amazing leftover as all of the flavors mixed more. Also I added the garlic to the food processor without crushing it, which I'll make sure to do next time to get more flavor.

This stew ALWAYS turns out well! I make it w/out the fish (just mussels, scallops, and sometimes shrimp and/or clams). The tomato base is light and tasty and can easily be made ahead of time. I've even made it a week ahead of time and then frozen it. Just re-heat the day of serving, and at the last minute toss in the fresh seafood. Either way, it is always a hit and guests rave!

Indeed easy to make and tasty enough. I liked it better upon reheating with a generous squeeze from a lemon. But not particularly flabbergasting to me. I'm not dying to make it again.

This is the easiest cioppino I have ever made. And one of the best. Trying to use sustainable seafood and my local fish market I made it with tilapia, little neck clams and sea scallops. As many others, I used fennel seed as the fennel bulb wasn't available. This is a great recipe.

I made this for the first time on New Year's Eve. A group of us were staying at a friend's beach house and it seemed an appropriate dish. I doubled the recipe and the only change I made was to use half clams and half mussels. I used halibut for the fish. It was out of this world -- everyone swooned. We ate the leftovers the next day while watching football on TV. The only change I would make would be to add more garlic and maybe throw in some crabmeat and/or squid. Everyone wanted the recipe -- a definite, definite keeper.

i'm just learning to cook and this is one of the easiest, most delicious meals i've made so far. i used halibut and replaced fresh fennel with fennel seads since my local stores didn't have any. it was absolutely fabulous, and even better the 2nd day! serve with a baguette and you're set to feed 4-5 people.

This was as easy as the title infers and completely fabulous. I used mussels and clams (no fish) and I doubled the recipe. Since I used the clams I did not double the clam juice. Had this dish for lunch the following couple of days as well... DELICIOUS!

Delicious, healthy and perfect for a fast, after-work dinner. Substituted 1.5 lbs scallops for halibut and used a Cabernet, nixed the onions (hubby's request) and clam juice (didn't find any), used fresh jalapeno and Pomi chopped tomatoes. Parmesan crisps, mesclun salad and the remainder of the cab on the side took the edge off -10F outside.

This recipe was very good, especially the effort-to -taste ratio. Made some changes to add more flavor 2nd time around. 1. Spicewise: roast in small saucepan 1/2 tsp each aniseed and cuminseed,stir for 1 min until toasted and fragrant...then grind in spice grinder or mort.n pist. Add 1/2 tsp dry oregano to mixture and 1 tsp sugar... Add spices to recipe with salt, peppers,bay leaves. etc. 2. Liquids: Substitute 1 cup low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 cup beer for the water. 3. Herbs. Chop 1 tablespoon each cilantro and fresh basil...stir in with seafood. I also threw in 1/2 lbs large prawns... whatever floats your seafood boat would work at the end. Will make this recipe again. I also got the "way better than a restaruant" review from my wife. Good recipe!

Rating: 4
Really as quick as it states. None of the other recipes had the fennel bulb; it added volume and a delicate flavor. I crushed/pulverized the fennel, onion, and garlic in food processor so the base consistency was smoother. Was a wonderful lunch for guests. I added (in the following cooking order) crab legs, clams, snapper, shrimp, and scallops for more variety. Served with garlic sourdough bread. Amazing and healthy. I made it again 2 nights later!

Rating: 4
This is a really great base. Used a different combo of seafood ( bf went crazy at the fish shop) - oysters, scallops, mussels, clams, crab, and some sort of white fish. Found it was slightly lacking in flavor as made - maybe my herbs were old? - so we just kept adding herbs, more wine, and a little bit of olive oil until we liked it. Served with toasted, buttered sourdough bread (essential) and we were happy, happy people.

I made this with a few personal adjustments and it was delicious. Instead of the mussels I added bay scallops, shrimp, and crab meat. I also boiled the shrimp shells and added the stock to stew for more fish flavor. I didn't add a full cup of wine but added a can of diced tomatoes and used ground fennel seeds since I couldn't find fresh fennel.

Delicious! I added 1/2 lb. medium shrimp, head-on, and 1/2 lb. bay scallops. Also used 2 lbs. mussels because that's how they sell 'em. Added a little bit extra clam juice just to cover all the shellfish. Made some garlic croutons to go with it. Phenomenal.

This was delicious!!! After the first time I made it, my boyfriend requested it for his birthday dinner! I've made this twice now and I made a few changes. I didn't have any fennel bulb, so I used about 1 tsp of fennel seeds instead. I omitted the fish, and instead added little neck clams, shrimp and scallops. It was incredible. Make sure you have a nice crusty bread to go with!

Rating: 4
This recipe was easy to make, and so delicious! I don't particularly like fennel, but it's quite subtle and adds a fresh, full flavor to the dish. I recommend using a food processor to finely mince the onions, garlic, and fennel prior to sauteing it so you get a nice thick broth where the only chunks are fish. Also, I added a can of minced clams to give it even more. It made about five servings. I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to make, and very filling and tasty. I needed to add a little more liquid towards the end of cooking as the sauce boiled down a little too much. Just needed a bit more water, splash more wine and a bit more tomato and juice and it was good to go. It is a very thick stew, but all the better for sopping up with crusty buttery bread!

Great recipe. Leave any fresh fish (shrimp, etc.) for very last as they cook the quickest (2 min or less). The mussels need at least 5 min. I make this once a month during the winter. A great crowd pleaser, and a super simple one-pot wonder!

This soup is freakin' amazing! And so easy. My modifications were to use Tilapia, because it's way cheaper than halibut and holds up well, and to add some shrimp and bay scallops. I also added some Italian seasoning at the end, because I thought it was just a little bland. I will definitely make this again.

Great, quick & easy. Followed previous suggestions and chopped vegetables by hand and omitted the water.

Thank you everyone for the suggestions! I added pernod and eliminated the water. In addition, it needed sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. I made enough broth for lunch the next day. Very tastly and will go into our regular rotation.

I made half the recipe and used what seafood I had on hand--scallops, crabmeat, and cod. I loved the speed with which dinner was on the table. I think adding a tablespoon or more of Pernod or Herbsaint would improve the dish. However, for a flavorful, lowfat, speedy dish, this rates near the top.

I have a complex recipe for Cioppino that I love. I was thrilled to make this quick and easy version and find it delicious! I added shrimp, clams and I used seabass as I was not able to find halibut.

Thank you again for yet another success!! Kat From Fremont/Palo Alto

I thought the fennel would be too much as I'm not a big fan of anise but it was perfect. The stew had a nice rich flavor and texture - I followed the recipe to the "T" and was very happy. Next time I'll try some different veggies (green pepper, celery) and different/more seafood but I wouldn't remove anything from the base - it was too good!

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC and so easy. I opted for 1/2 cup less water and hand chopped the veggies. I also omitted 1/2 of the onion. I used 1/2 lb shrimp, 1 lb mussels, 1 lb clams, 1/4 lb scallops and 1/2 lb halibut. Next time I make this (which will be very soon), I'm going to keep the shrimp, scallops and halibut out of the boil until the mussels and clams have cooked for 2+ minutes - they were a bit overdone. Warmed sourdough bread is a must!

Just amazing! I had a very hard day at work with a house guest awaiting dinner at home. The house guest was a retired maitre d' who really knew food. I knew I couldn't manage Plan A (a complicated dinner) so I looked to Epicurious for rescue. I did a search for something quick, easy, and highly rated and found this. I already had most of the ingredients so I had only to make a quick stop at the store for fennel and a loaf of crusty bread. I used shrimp, scallops, and halibut, half the fennel and no water -- thanks to the other reviewers. I also simmered (a high simmer) rather than boiled the liquid for the 20 minutes. The aroma was wonderful. The result was delicious and tasted far more complicated than the simple ingredients and prep time involved. With just the crusty bread and a bottle of wine we had a great dinner which I, particularly, enjoyed because I wasn't stressed or exhausted from the prep. We both gave it four stars for taste but five stars for ease. This recipe is a keeper! I'm eager to try other combinations of seafood. Thank you, Epicurious!

Ifollowed the recipie with these exceptions. I used catfish due to a lack of availibility of fresh pollack or hallibut. I also used a petite sirah that had tried before and liked.

Not as quick as the one I usually make, but very good. For an even quicker one skip the veggies and tomatoes and use low salt V8 instead. Much quicker and juat as tasty. I use homemade seafood stock rather than clam broth, and whatever strikes my fancy at the fish counter or even (gasp!) frozen!

I made quite a few substitutions in this recipe, one quite by accident and it still turned out wonderfully. I've never had the real thing but this was great, I used cod in place of the halibut as both stores I went to were not in stock of fresh halibut. I didn't have a problem with the overly fishy taste another reviewer had, possibly because I rinsed the fish several times in icy water. I also used cayenne pepper in place of red pepper flakes and the flavor was just fine. I realized the next day that when I had grabbed the "zinfandel" off the store shelf I had in fact grabbed the wrong bottle and ended up using a "Shiraz" instead. No matter, the flavors harmonized beautifully, with no clash at all. Next time however I'll follow the recipe to the letter, so I can see the difference..

Rating: 3
Considering the ease and short prep time, this is not bad at all, though I've never had the real thing mind you. If you have a 7-cup food processor like me, better to process the vegetables in 2 batches, or you'll end up with a mince. Why not just chop by hand? It would only add about 2 minutes and save some cleanup on the food processor as well. Also, by the recipe, it's underseasoned and needs more salt, especially critical since the seafood only cooks in the broth a very short time. Also pay attention to the fish you choose. The only thing I thought suitable and available was cod, and it was too fishy and a horrible clash with red wine. I would have been better off with thick fillets of catfish, which are readily available.

This was a very easy recipe to prepare, which was it's strength. Some cioppinos are more elaborate, but for a weeknight, this worked perfect.
