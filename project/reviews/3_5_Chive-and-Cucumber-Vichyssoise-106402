I liked this recipe a lot, but as with many others, with my own variations. I substituted plain yogurt for the whipping cream. I also only put in about a tablespoon of chives along with some extra for garnish. Read to late that you are not supposed to make it more than 6 hours in advance. I did it over night and it came out fine. I added an extra cucumber about an hour before serving to perk up the cucumber flavor. I will definitely make it again and again.

very tasty.as recommended by others i cut chives in half but added a handful of parsley and pureed that with the cucumber and 3/4 cup greek yoghurt and added that to each serving plate. also much easier to puree leek and potato mixture with all cooking liquid.

so easy to make and very tasty.

The chive flavor really did dominate, with strong accents of grass. Perhaps cutting the volume of chives in half would make a difference, but this was too labor intensive for what we got and I won't make it again.

Wow, this is one of the best vichyssoise recipes I have ever tasted. Everyone loved it!

This is one of the best soups I have ever made. I didn't find the chives overpowering, but did add additional fresh-ground black pepper. My guests raved & begged for additional servings.

I made this soup for a friend for Easter and now he begs for it all the time. The cucumber makes it a very refreshing treat for these hot summer days. Although very easy to make, the taste was very complex and wonderful.

This soup would be wonderful without the extreme chive taste. I added extra cream (1/4 cup), 1 TBSP of lemon juice to each portion upon serving and a dash of Cholula hot sauce and the chive taste still dominated. I'll try 1/2 the chives and a dollop of creme fraiche on top along with other changes above next time as this soup has great potential as a refreshing summer first course.
