I have no clue what I did wrong!! I went by the recipe and I took one bite into the cupcake and half of it crumbled, not to mention the cheesecake middle tasted like soap. This all probably happened because of something that I did. Truly sounded like a good recipe.

I actually quite liked these cupcakes. They aren't your traditional supersweet with a heaping mountain of frosting cupcakes but they are tasty. The only thing I changed based on previous reviews was I did cut down on the salt (which was a good choice). Beyond that the only thing I can think of that would make them better is to serve them with a little homemade raspberry jam. Though not the best cupcakes I've ever had, they will definitely give you your chocolate/cheesecake fix.

This recipe worked well for me. I followed it almost exactly...the only thing I might change is to add a little more sugar to the cupcake part of the recipe. I am surprised there were so many negative reviews--and I am confused by those of you who say it made "way more" than 12 cupcakes. When I made it, I got 16 cupcakes instead of 12, but that's not abnormal for a recipe. Also, make sure you only fill your cupcake slots only 1/3 of the way full with batter and you shouldn't have a problem. My cupcakes looked beautiful, no mess to be had!

These Cupcakes were good, but not great like I thought they would be. Chocolate? Cheesecake? How could it be wrong? Alas - meh. Maybe if I made a "bunch of little changes" they might have been really good, but I doubt it. They were eaten. Nobody spit it out. Nobody moaned with delight. I expect moans with cheesecake and chocolate. I won't make it again.

Despite bad reviews, I had a single 8 ounce package of cream cheese I needed to get rid of and this recipe was perfect. I made a bunch of little changes, and the cupcakes came out great. For the filling, I used a 1/4 teaspoon of salt instead of a 1/2, and used regular table salt instead of kosher salt for the cupcakes. I also only had unsweetened chocolate (powder and bars) in the house, and non-fat milk. Since I only had unsweetened chocolate, I added extra sugar. The result wasn't very pretty, but tasted reaaal good. :3

WOW, I can't believe these reviews. Everyone LOVED these cupcakes. I only made 12 and yes, there was a lot of filling and batter. The cupcakes overflowed and the bottoms caved in a bit from the weight of the top, but the taste was unbelievable. The only changes I made to the recipe were adding extra Mexican Vanilla and using 1 cup of regular sized semisweet chocolate chips to the filling instead of the 1/4 cup of mini. Perhaps that is why the cupcakes weren't salty.

I do not recommend this recipe. I was very disappointed as I depend on the magazine for recipes I've never tried before to be excellent & reliable. Every comment made by reviewers (too salty, too much overflow, not sweet) was correct. My kids (5 & 7) did not like them at all (and they usually eat pretty much everything!). Run away from this recipe as fast as you can! You'll regret it if you make them! I did.

I also agree that the proportions were a bit off. Our attempt made about 18 cupcakes and we still had some cream cheese mix left over. Also, I agree that the cream cheese mix was a bit salty. Next time I will reduce or leave the salt out of the cream cheese mixture.

I am not a baker but I made these for a work event. I used all the batter for 12 cupcakes so there was some overflow once they baked and it took longer than the recomended time. I was a little nervous after trying the cream cheese mix before it was baked but they were great and everyone loved them. No issue with anything being to salaty but I just eyeballed it. They were so moist and rich. I may add a little more sugar to the cream cheese mixture next time but overall I thought these were great.

I have to wonder how this recipe got published! It has errors in the amounts - there is enough batter for at least 18 cupcakes and there is way too much salt - did they test this recipe? There have to be better recipes for black bottom cupcakes out there maybe even on epicurious!

I have been making a similiar version of these for years. The filling is spot on, but these cupcakes are more complicated than my simple recipe and the results aren't worth the extra effort. When these are made right, they are incredibly moist and delicious. Years ago I lost this recipe and found it again on the internet - well worth the search.

My main problem with this recipe is that it makes literally double what the recipe says, so my first batch I tried to fit all the batter in 12 cupcakes, which led to overflowing cups and no visible cream cheese. So my advice is to plan on making 18-24 cupcakes with the batter and filling rather than just 12. As for the flavor of the resulting cupcakes, they turned out great. I used regular chocolate chips and thought that was just fine. I loved the texture dichotomy between the the cream cheese and the chocolate cupcake. I removed promptly at 35 minutes, which made them extra-moist and chocolatey. I did not find the cream cheese filling too salty, and because the cupcakes are so sweet already I liked that the cream cheese mixture was not so sweet.

These cupcakes were not very good at all. The cream cheese filling just didn't have that YUM factor and the cupcakes were lacking in sweetness overall. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and some changes definitely need to be made before these cakes should leave the house.

The cream cheese filling was way too salty. I thought maybe it was just the batter and would taste different once it was cooked, but it was still salty. I will not make these again.

I wasn't impressed. cupcakes came out with flat tops that broke off at the edges. The filling was too salty and not sweet enough. I have a much better black bottom cupcake recipe.

Made these yesterday for a dinner party of kids and adults - everyone liked them. To the reviewer who said the cake was crumbly, I'd guess you overcooked them. I didn't find them oversalted, but everyone's got their own palate!

The cake was great, not too sweet, although mine came out super crumbly. The cream cheese was a nice idea and turned out OK but I would reduce the salt next time, and maybe add a little more vanilla/sugar.

The cupcakes were good but the cream cheese filing added nothing! I agree with the other reviewers, there is something not quite right about the filing recipe...too salty not enough sweet. I used a pastry bad to pipe in my filing. I ended up frosting them with vanilla icing and when you had a mouthful of chocolate, cream cheese and vanilla it was yummy but with just cupcake and filing...m'eh.

Ok, I agree with folks who complain when others drastically change a recipe then rate it. However, this one does have a bit of merit. I made these last evening for co- workers and got several requests for the recipe. I took the concept, BUT, because of time limits, used a boxed mix(triple chocolate fudge, no less), and then added the cream cheese/cheesecake center, following the directions as listed. As others mentioned, I don't typically add all the salt listed, so this was not an issue. I did ice them once the cupcakes cooled. And the box mix makes more than 12--so good for a group. With THESE changes, this will be a recipe I will repeat.

I made these as written and was disappointed with the filling. It had a strange taste. Kids didn't eat them either. Maybe more sugar in the cream cheese.

first off, there is WAY too much salt in this recipe, particularly in the cream cheese filling! i used 1/2 that amount and the finished product was still dangerously close to unplatable. i also cut the salt in the cake itself in half. don't get me wrong, i'm not one of those anti-salt goofuses (goofi?), but this was extreme. i personally liked that the cupcake was not overly sweet, but that didn't win any favors with the kiddies in the crowd. i guess the ones in the article have a more refined palate then these, lol. the concept gets a fork, but there are better recipes to use your precious chocolate on.
