This was a pretty solid recipe. I needed a good substantive dish for a potluck that everyone would like and everyone could eat (vegetarians included), and this turned out wonderfully. I doubled the recipe, added sun-dried tomatoes for some extra color and zing, and substituted peas for lima beans, and it turned out quite well. The only minor hitch I had was cooking the peas alongside the pasta--I didn't follow the directions and added them too late, resulting in a few undercooked peas left with the cooked pasta. All in all, this seemed like a good dish that worked well with everyone; I'd definitely make this again.

liked the idea of the sauce, so I made it with some pumpkin ravioli. Excellent. Used a lemon creme fraiche with it, which was really tasty.

A good family dish. It is quick and tasty, pleases the kids, and even tastes great cold.

I can't believe this recipe hasn't gotten more reviews. I was a little worried that it would be bland but I made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious. It reminded me of a grownup mac and cheese and will be on comfort food rotation in my home. I used a black pepper goat cheese, tri-color fiori and added some green beans that I needed to use up. It was a great combination of textures and colors.

I used edamamae beans instead of frozen lima. Was great! I know someone who used frozen peas instead of lima and also said it worked with the dish.

i made this and it was tasty, although could have used some color. the cream and cheese melted over everything, and it looked like a whitish gray mess. tasted nice though Very easy (10 minutes to boil water. Then can prep everything else while the pasta cooks).

Just made a test batch this morning. It is simple and just what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly (I used whole-wheat pasta and cooked it a bit longer) I will definitely be adding this to my recipe box!
