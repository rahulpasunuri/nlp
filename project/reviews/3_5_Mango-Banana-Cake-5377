To the editors of Epicurious: along with the volume ("cup") measurements, please consider indicating the weight of the required ingredients in your recipes. This would permit more consistent results. I'm thinking that the common problem of dryness that people are relating in their comments may be a result of too much of the dry ingredients being used, too little of the wet, or some combination thereof. Thanks.

I read all reviews before attempting this, so I worried a bit about dryness. I decided to follow the recipe exact--next time I'm going to double the banana and see how it does. Somewhat dry, but then I was baking 9 inch cakes, 6 regular cupcakes, and 12 mini's. The regular size cake turned out perfect, but not enough banana for me. Also, I opted out of the mango curd due to time. Instead I made a mango sorbet to serve along side, and made a mango glaze from 1/3 cup of the puree and 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar. I also made a dark chocolate glaze and alternated glazes with the cupcakes. For the regular cake, I used a mango glaze in the center and whipped the chocolate glaze into a frosting. This made for an interesting treat. Next time I will make the mango curd and the cream cheese frosting, and my only modification will be more banana in the cake.

The cakes were dry. I even used oil as others suggested since my bananas weren't quite brown. Making the rest ofthe cake was daunting. The curd slipped drizled out between the layers and I used the frosting to sort of hold it all together. It looked like a bombe and it certainly would have suffered by coming out of the refrigerator 2 hours before serving. But people liked it OK enough. Just too much work when other recipes come out so much better.

Just made this cake for Mother's Day. It was perfect; spring-y and tropical. The cake was delicious - you could really taste the freshly ground nutmeg. Be careful not to overbake; layers are thin. I added a layer of freshly sliced strawberries ontop of the mango curd, then I decorated the top and sides of cakes with more sliced strawberries. Very tropical & tasty. Also, the suggestion with the bamboo skewers is perfect. I used toothpicks and it worked great. You will need to do a crumb layer of frosting, and keep it chilled in order to prevent cake from sliding off platter.

I suddenly needed a cake, and I had almost all the ingredients for this recipe (except mango curd). It was very moist and flavorful. There was still the taste of mango by substituting with slices of it between the layers. This time I'll make it for my family; not someone else's!

I loved this cake so much, I had it at my wedding. Ofcourse we had to change the frosting as it would have melted outside in the summer heat. But this is definitely my favorite cake ever!

Delicious -- a wecome change from banana bread. For a light and moist cake, I suggest mashing the banana thoroughly and measuring it carefully. And make sure not to over mix/beat the batter when combing the ingredients. I had only a morning to make this cake so added 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch to the mango puree to make sure it was thick enough.

This cake was dry and too dense. I was very disappointed.

This is delicious and makes a beautiful presentation. Due to time constraints, I was tempted to skip the mango curd but I'm glad I didn't. It was wonderful and since I didn't use it all during the assembly of the cake, I made decorative swirls with it on the plates alongside each serving. To those of you who thought the cake was dry, I'm wondering if the bananas you used were ripe enough. I used 2 medium sized bananas with lots of brown "sugar" spots on the peel. Bananas, much like peaches, aren't juicy if they aren't ripe. And the Martha Stewart tip about the skeweres was a good one.

I thought the cake was dry, the frosting was the average cream cheese frosting, and the custard was not good unless it had sugar added to it, and was left in the fridge overnight. Everyone liked it, but I wouldn't make it for a special occasion.

Although I have not yet made this cake, I was watching a recent episode of Martha Stewart, and to keep her three-layer coconut cake from sliding around, or toppling right over, she inserted at least two bamboo skewers right into the cake itself (after assembling the layers but before frosting it) and snipped off the ends that stuck out. I think I will try this technique when I make this cake!

I first made this for my husband's birthday last year - it was a huge hit, and he requests it now whenever company comes over, and some of our friends are getting used to it - and one set of friends were even disappointed when they came over and I made something else! It has always turned out to be moist for me - I just think it is quite time consuming, but still - totally worth it!

I did check this recipe after I had read these reviews and it is correct. I had no trouble with it, and it certainly was delicious and was totally consumed by a group of eight at one sitting. I used two bananas to make my 1 cup of mashed banana, maybe this was really a little more than 1 cup, but the cake was moist and better than average. I've had several requests to make it again.

We did not care for this cake at all. The cake was dry and the frosting & filling too rich. Normally I'm not one to complain about food being too rich, but this one goes too far...

Wonderful cake! Nice twist to your typical banana cake. I took the advice of one cook and added 1 T. oil to batter and the cake was quite moist. Need to watch the cooking time carefully--not to overbake--since the layers are fairly thin the cake can dry out quickly. Also, tricky to layer the cake without the top layer sliding around. I added curd in the center of each layer (leaving 1" from edge without curd). After top layer was added, refrigerate for 15 min. Refrigerating the entire cake again, after frosting, seemed to help with the sliding as well. I will definitely make this cake again.

This is an excellent cake for summer parties. Very refreshing with the mango/ banana combination, even though it's a little bit of work. A sure crowd pleaser.

This cake was wonderful!! I have made it two times now, the first was when I saw it in the magazine, and again just recently. However the second time I made it, I got the recipe on-line and it seemed to be missing an ingrediant. It came out delicious again, but the cake itself was very dense, not moist like i remembered it being. When I make it again, (and believe me, I will!), I think I will try to add a touch of vegetable oil to moisten it up.

The banana cake was very nice, good flavor. The mango curd, which does not have enough body to stay on the cake, is the problem. The top layer just slides right off. Is something missing from the recipe? Prehaps some gelatin? Someone should double check this recipe.
