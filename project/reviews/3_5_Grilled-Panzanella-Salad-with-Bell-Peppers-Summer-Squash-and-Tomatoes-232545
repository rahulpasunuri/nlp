Delicious! I baked a few cloves of garlic and whipped it into the oil and vinegar and added sliced olives to give it more of a Mediterranean flavor. We had leftovers and added a can of quartered artichokes the next day; excellent addition!

Excellent! Lovely & tasty side dish!

I made this without the dressing, because I was worried about leftovers being soggy, and even then it turned out wonderfully.

My family loved this salad. We added fresh mozz and used balsalmic vinegar because that was all I had on hand. A definite crowd pleaser!

Love this salad and a bit surprised at the negative reviews. Then again soggy bread in panzanella doesn't bother me! I think it's almost better the next day. It is labour intensive - but it's a wonderful hearty salad. Especially if you have vegetarian guests!

This recipe was delicious! I made it in the summer when there are lots of fresh herbs and spectacular vegetables available. I agree that next time I would put the bread in at the last minute because I found it became a bit mushy.

this was a great base recipe, I just used it as a model, took out the capers and made the dressing without measurements to taste. A fast and easy way to use those fresh summer veggies.

Don't make this unless you can serve it warm from the grill. It is yucky when it cools. Also the herb amounts are more than you really need.

An addendum... I actually just read over the recipe again and I did make a couple of changes: I use balsalmic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and omit the capers!

I love this salad and have made it numerous times for many friends and family. It is a hit every time! I just use whatever herbs I have fresh at the time and otherwise make it according to the recipe. We usually grill a tritip or pork tenderloin and that's it for dinner--a great summer meal as all the cooking is outside!

I have never tasted a better panzanella. I can't imagine why someone would have had trouble with this recipe save for the fact that some people just don't like panzanella. The grilled bread is phenomenal & the flavors of the grilled veggies and dressing come together marvelously.

I made this exactly as written, except reduced the lemon zest and lemon juice by half. Terrible. I agree with one of the other reviewers- the grilled vegetables and herbs smelled great, but the flavour was boring and predictable. Perhaps I simply picked the wrong herbs to use (I used parsley, oregano and basil)? A waste of quality ingredients. Most of the salad at the party was left in the bowl.

I made this according to the original recipe. The vegetables smell and taste great up until the point the dressing goes on. I'm a big fan of grilled squash and bell peppers as well as fresh herbs, but the dressing is too lemony & spoiled it for me.

Great salad and very easy. A salad to make again and again in the summer. As suggested by others, I omitted the lemon zest. For the herbs, I used basil and tarragon.

Yummy yummy yummy with fresh harvest veggies and quality bread. Cut the lemon a bit and/or add a bit of sugar to cut tartness. Be sure to grill the bread well, makes the difference. Home Grown tomatoes makes it heavenly. We also added grilled chicken we had on hand. Great recipe.

To the cook from washington, did you grill the bread until browned? I also don't toss the bread in until I am putting it on the table. My grandma used to make something similar to this. She always used stale bread and toasted it until a deep brown.

I must have done something wrong. everyone had globs of bread pushed aside on their plates. Maybe it got too soggy, or I didn't start out with crispy enough bread. Otherwise, it was great. Is it supposed to be soggy?

Awesome, I made this as a side dish for Sunday dinner, everyone loved it. I thought as I was making it that there would something leftover, however they licked the bowl clean. It is alot of prep work, however well worth it. My family has asked me to make it for Thanksgiving. This time I will omit rubbing the garlic on the bread, it added too much of a sharp garlic taste.

Amazing, lovely, delicious.

I loved this salad. The sweetness of the peppers, the chewy, tangy bread chunks with the lemon vinaigrette were a nice contrast to each other. I followed the recipe except used only fresh basil and tarragon as my herbs. The reason I only gave it three forks is the prep work involved - at least 1 and a half hours with the grilling. A bit labor intensive for a side dish.

This recipe is somewhat labor intensive, but worth the effort. It is a bit unusual and very tasty. Enjoyed by all. Will make again whenever squash, peppers, and tomatoes are plentiful.

This was an excellent recipe. I ended up adding grilled eggplant to the mix of veggies as well. I will definately make this again.

This was amazing--all my guests left with a copy of the recipe! Like others I cut the lemon--just used the juice of 1 lemon.

Loved this salad. Made it exactly as written, and it ws delicious. Make sure that you use good tomatoes, it adds tremendously to the flavor.

After reading the other reviews about the amount of lemon they would use again, I cut back just a little on the lemon juice & omitted the lemon zest. This was an amazing salad! I was a little worried about the bread in it though, but it added just the extra touch - especially when the bread soaked up the dressing & were super flavorful bites to go with the veggies. Super easy & had a good "ta-da" at our dinner. Our dinner guests were raving about the flavor & begged me for the recipe! Definitely a keeper recipe & one we will make all through the year!

I made this salad for dinner when my sister and her family were visiting us. Even the kids who "don't eat vegetables" loved it! With the best of what summer has to offer, this is a winner!

Absolutely loved this salad, but I also thought the dressing was a little too tart so I added a touch of honey. It toned down the lemony tartness. Otherwise, I could eat this everyday.

This was great with our grilled beer can chicken. The only change I would make is to cut down the lemon juice to 2 teaspoons. It is to tart

I loved this. What a great way to use fresh summer vegetables and herbs. Those who aren't crazy about lemon might want to adjust the amount of zest. My husband thought it was overpowering.

The combination of grilled veggies, smokey grilled bread, and the lemon dressing was very good. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars! I used lots of fresh basil, italian parsley, fresh oregano and fresh mint. Make sure you grill the bread until well toasted (but not burned) so that it holds up to the dressing. A little crumbled feta would be a good additon.
