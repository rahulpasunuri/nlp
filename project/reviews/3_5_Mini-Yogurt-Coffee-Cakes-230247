Used fat free lemon yogurt. It was great. Ate most of it myself (I almost never do that. Added 1/2 tsp salt, used a little less sugar, left out vanilla and used oil instead of butter. Made a strusel topping without cinnamon. Would use lemon zest if making with lemon yogurt next time.

The baby bundts are an elegant brunch addition, and my family loved them. I used nonfat plain yogurt, replaced 1/4 c flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and decreased the sugar. Turned out great. It is a bit tricky to spread the 2T batter out in each bundt before putting the topping in, but it worked fine; I think next time I will worry less about making the batter & topping even in the ring.

I'm not sure where I went wrong with this recipe. They came out beautiful and then deflated almost half the height within minutes! I also found them a little greasy, definitely not low-fat. They do have a wonderful flavor though. I think I would cut back on the butter next time and add a little more cinnamon.

My husband and I both loved these. They deliver real coffee cake flavor without a trace of sourness, although that could be because I used full-fat yogurt. Like other reviewers, I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and a pinch of salt to the batter, and I baked them in a muffin tin. I also used raw almond slices rather than toasted and I sprinkled a little of the sugar mixture on top before baking. The muffins separating was not an issue for us. Delish!

My husband and I both loved these. Not really low-fat, though, with 6 Tbsp. of butter! I used full fat yogurt, and like other reviewers, I added a tsp. of cinnamon and a pinch of salt to the batter. I also baked them in a muffin tin. I used raw sliced almonds rather than toasted and I sprinkled a little of the sugar mixture on the top of the muffins. The muffins separating was not an issue for us. Delish!

Just made these this morning and it is fabulous. I made it in muffins tins,as a reviewer below suggested, and added some cinnamon to the dry ingredients. Delicious!

I added the pinch of salt that was mentioned below and the recipe tasted great - moist but not heavy. I also made a batch using almond extract instead of vanilla, and organic sugar instead of white (the smell of organic sugar is reminiscent of rum). The result was fabulous. Definitely a new favorite recipe.

I am sitting here right now eating this moist treat as I write this review. I made them in a Texas size muffin tin and they came out ok, but next time I would take the advise of the previous reviewer and mix in the filling a bit because the top part of the muffin did separate a bit. It does seem some extra cinnamon in the batter would help make it tastier, but it still is very good. My husband had a big reaction and really loved it! The funny thing was he is originally English (I'm American)and he asked if there was coffee in the recipe. I had to explain what coffee cake was! Now that I think about the original version, this one could benefit from some icing to balance off the sourness from the yogurt.

really good and moist for a lower fat cake. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and some salt as well because otherwise it seemed like it would be bland and also made it into 12 muffins (cook 25 min) rather than 6 cakes. I also swirled the filling in a bit to make sure it didn't divide the muffin batter into two pieces.
