The cake itself was delicious -- I would make it again without the pear topping. Despite incorporating the guidance of other reviewers, and the fact that everything seemed to go as described, the caramel tasted burnt and had almost no sweetness. Probably user error, but I was pretty diligent. If I try the topping again, I'll look for a different caramel recipe.

Absolutely best chocolate cake I have ever had. I liked that it was not overly sweet like a lot of chocolate cakes can be. I will be making this again!

This recipe is delicious. The only change I made is how to make the fruit topping. I found the "wet" method difficult and I had to toss the first batch. Instead, melt a cup of sugar in a small frying pan over medium heat. The sugar will melt first on the ends, so simply use a heat proof spatula to mix the sugar. Once it is completely melted pour it into the cake pan. Easy.

Easy and delicious...BUT DEFINITELY NOT VEGETARIAN...IT HAS BUTTER, MILK AND EGGS..AND A SUGGESTION TO SERVE WITH ICE CREAM...THESE ARE NOT ON A VEGETARIAN DIET. I first thought to make this for my VEGETARIAN children...but read the ingredients and made it for some friends who happened to stop by for dinner.

Sadly Epicurious miss printed this recipe by forgetting to put the water quantity in the ingredient list; it is 1/4 cup.

This is just about the most fantastic chocolate cake I have ever tasted. Made it according to recipe, but took others suggestions to cut pears a little thicker to use most of 3 pears.

amazing and unique cake! i pretty much followed the recipe. the caramel making was a little confusing but everything turned out great and the cake was super moist, rich and delicious. i served with fresh whipped cream.

made this almost as written. I cheated on the caramel and just used caramel cubes with a little butter. Melted them in the pan then poured pears on top of hot caramel a few minutes while I finished cake recipe. I also reduced (per comment) sugar to 1/2 c. in cake recipe and the cake was so perfect in taste, rich but not too sweet or overly rich. Great chocolate cake and so good with the pears, just the right addition to it.

Absolutely incredible! Will make again. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used Dutch processed cocoa with cayenne pepper. Yummy spice with dark chocolate!!

I liked the taste but I made a few changes in addition to adding buttermilk. I made the caramel by dissolving spots of sugar in a pan, then stirred in a few Tbsp butter. The pears were then laid on top and cooked for a few minutes to reduce the liquid.

P.S I've made this cake several times and it always comes out perfect.

This is a really great cake. Very moist and fluffy and the ginger and cinnamon really complement one another. It's sweet enough without the sauce!

Dry crumb! No good.

I hustled through this recipe and ended up combining everything in the wrong order, but it turned out wonderfully all the same. The caramel nearly burnt but the smokiness was lovely with the sweetness. Took it out of the oven after 35 minutes and it was still on the moist side. This beauty ages well- several days later it's much richer and denser than when fresh. Can't wait to try it in the summer with other fruits and berries.

I have never made caramel before and my first batch was a crystallized mess. Found a good video online with better instructions (and a tip to add 1/4tsp lemon juice) and the second batch came out perfect. The cake is really delicious and moist. I served it with Starbucks Caramel Mochiatto ice cream and it was a perfect complement.

I just want to add this to my previous review. My cake was very moist and I cooked it for the full time. I think the buttermilk made the difference and my pears were very juicy. I also used my cast iron skillet to bake in. Worked like a charm.

This cake turned out fabulous but there was some missing information for the fruit topping, like how do you make caramel without butter? I used a recipe for upside down pineapple cake for the missing info. I still would like to know how much water you add to the sugar? If I had never made caramel before, I don't think I would have been as successful. Rewrite the directions. I also used buttermilk instead of whole milk.

I made this cake yesterday for a dinner with my boyfriends' family. The cake got rave reviews. I did have a couple of problems with the recipe. I had some sugar crystals form on top of the pears. I think it was because I didn't wash down the sides of the pan when the sugar was cooking. As another reviewer noted, I could only fit 2 pears, not three, and I did the 12 slices/pear as directed. The cake was very moist. I cooked it at 350 as suggested, but it was done 10 minutes early--it would have been very dry if I used the recommended cooking time. I would start checking on it after 30 minutes of baking.

I made this last night for a birthday, and it came out pretty well. Some thoughts; since I didn't see how much water to use, I consulted other recipes that I have made recently that feature making caramel, so I used 1/3 cup water. I don't recommend using any more than this as you will end up waiting around longer for the water to finally boil off. I used the lid as suggested, and for some reason, this seemed to cook cook the sugar faster, if this is possible; the color turned from pale yellow to dark amber almost in an instant, and I was afraid of burning it, but I turned off the gas just in time. When you put your pears into the pan, they will begin cooking in the caramel instantly, so don't be alarmed if there is a layer of liquid on top of your caramel by the time you get around to finishing the chocolate cake batter (I am very slow in the kitchen)! I second the opinion of the overestimation of the time to bake; I thought I smelled the caramel burning around 30 minutes, and when I took it out at 34 minutes and did the knife test, it was completely dry. Everyone liked it, but I wish the cake were more moist, so I think I'll check it around 30 minutes next time. I used excellent 99% cocoa dark chocolate, so the batter itself amazing. I look forward to having a second go at it!

Awesome!! 4 forks for sure. An unusual combination, but excellent. Looks very unassuming but it's one of the deepest chocolatiest cakes ever! The caramel is awesome. Next time I will cut the pears into larger/thicker pieces. I followed instructions exactly but couldn't fit all the pears in the bottom of my pan. I think I had one entire pear left over. Will make again for sure.

I am constantly in pursuit of ways to bring chocolate and fruit together -- this upside-down chocolate cake idea is such an easy and wonderful way to do it! The caramel part didn't work for me... for some reason my pastry-brush applied water didn't take the sugar off the sides of the pan....so I gave up and reverted to the old-fashioned way of making an upside down cake (a la Betty Crocker): 1/3 c melted butter + 1/2 c brown sugar in the bottom of the pan. Add sliced pears, then batter. Baked @ 350F 45 min. Worked great! Yum!

Nice cake, very moist and very chocolatey. Advice to A Cook: when making caramel always have a bowl of water and a clean pastry brush nearby. Wash down the sides of the pan often as the sugar caramelizes (this will prevent your caramel from crystalizing). You can also try what the recipe recommends: covering the pan initially to allow the steam to wash down the pan's sides. I'd rather keep my eye on it and do the brushing technique.

I can't really rate this since it is in the oven. I cooked the 1 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water watching carefully to see it turn golden. It bubbled along quite awhile and I noticed it was recrystalizing. I stirred and pulled out the spoon with large sugar crystals on it. I put the hard crystals in the bottom of the pan. Was I supposed to cook this further to carmelize it? That would be akin to using no water in the first place. I hope it turns out somehow..Advice?

I am a novice baker and found this to delicious and easy to make. I removed my cake from the oven a little early and the middle fell a bit. Next time I will bake for full 45 minutes. I had an issue with a bit of the caramel and pears sticking to the top of the pan, any hints on how to improve that? I was able to remove the pears from pan and put them back on the cake, looked and tasted fabulous.

If you click on the 'print' icon the full recipe will be displayed for the Fruit Topping ingredients. It lists 1 cup of sugar to 1/4 cup of water. I'm going to try this recipe now that I know the correct sugar/water ratio. : )

I have not made this, but I've made caramel many times for creme caramel. The process is the same. A 1 to 1 ratio is too much --- it will take forever for the water to evaporate and the sugar to caramelize. Experienced bakers can do the caramelization without the added water. For less experienced cooks, a tablespoon of water just to get things going is fine. Either way, watch carefully as the sugar can go from golden to burnt.

The cake part is delicious! I have never made caramel so I had no idea on how long to cook the sugar/water mixture or what consistency it should be. Is it supposed to thicken at any point? The only thing I had to go by was the color. I used 1 to 1 ratio of sugar to water as suggested and after about 30 minutes of constant stirring the liquid in the pan was runny and light brown (instead of suggested old copper penny brown) so I gave up and just poured it to the cake pan and had the pears swimming in it. I had to carefully spoon in the chocolate part to not push the liquid out on the sides. In the end the cake turned out great and the "sugary water" as I don't think it was caramel made the cake super moist. I will use this recipe again as I loved the rich chocolate taste but would love to improve the caramel part. Suggestions anyone?

This cake was excellent. The chocolate base is really rich and moist. I used Comice pears,and the fruits were a bit too soft to me. I will use bartlett pears next time.

Great fall dessert. I took the previous reviewer's advice and used a 1-to-1 sugar to water ratio and it came out beautifully. My oven does cook slightly hot, but I do think the baking time might be overestimated. The cake was completely done in 35 minutes.

It was excellent. To the previous poster, I used 1 to 1 ratio. I got beautiful caramel.

I'd really like to make this, but I don't know how much water to use for the fruit topping, as it's not listed in the ingredients. Are there any experts out there that can make an educated guess?
