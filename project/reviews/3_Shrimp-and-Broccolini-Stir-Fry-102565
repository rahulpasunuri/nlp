I made this on a Tuesday, like one of the other reviewers, and it was awesome! Quick, easy and delicious! I too substituted Oyster sauce for the Hoisin because I couldn't find it in two different stores. I used frozen precooked shrimp and I added green onions and water chestnuts for crunch. My husband raved about it. I will definitely made it again and share this recipe with my coworkers.

I've made this several times. I change the vegetables to what I have at hand or what looks good at the supermarket. Its a quick and tasty week day meal. I serve with a wild grain mix.

Oh - and I zested about a third of an orange over the dish as it was cooking. That added a nice contrast.

Because of the mediocre reviews, I doctored this a little bit and it was pretty good. I steamed my broccoli for just a minute, put it aside, sauteed mushrooms, then cooked the shrimp. I put all the ingredients for the sauce, plus hot pepper flakes, in a small jar with a tsp of cornstarch. Everything back in the pan to thicken and put over rice noodles. Sweetheart really liked it!

I'd say this one is pretty good for a Tuesday night, because it's fast, easy, tasty and nicely low-fat too. I'll definitely make it again as an "after work" dish. It's not worthy of company though, and won't make it to the weekend menu.

One fork represents an ok dish and that's all this was. Simplicity is what it has going for it. But the hoisin sauce was overwhelming, as someone else pointed out. I will make it again but with more vegetables and less hoisin sauce.

Pretty unremarkable dish. Perhaps it would be better with oyster sauce but it just wasn't so good.

I made this as written (but with broccoli). My husband and I both loved it and we have been under-impressed with many of the other stir-fry recipes we've tried. For a recipe with so few ingredients, it was very flavorful and delicious.

This dish was so-so. The flavors kind of got lost in the sauce. Maybe I should have substituted oyster sauce for the hoisin like a few reviewers mentioned. Otherwise, living in SF, I'd rather order in chinese food and save my shrimp for other recipes.

This recipie will become a staple - it is easy and delicious. I took another user's advice and substituted oyster sauce for hoisin with great results. I also used broccoli instead of broccolini. It's easiest if you mix all the wet ingredients together (water, soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes) into a sauce before you begin and throw it all in with the broccoli.

Wonderful and simple to make. Definite keeper. Since I did not have broccoli I used mixed Japanese veggies and used Oyster sauce as sometimes I find Hoisin sauce a bit on the strong side.

The first time I made this recipe, I didn't have Hoisin sauce and so I substituted it with Oyster Flavored sauce. It's much better with the Oyster Sauce. I also used broccoli and fresh mushrooms instead of broccolinni. It's now a family favorite.

This was good and comes together very quickly. I definitely recommend having all ingredients prepped before you start cooking. Next time I do this, I'll use more broccolini (which really works well in this) because I prefer a higher vegetable to protein ratio.

I have to do a lot of substitutions in general, either because of my strict gluten-free diet (no wheat, barley or rye or byproducts) or because I'm too lazy to go to the store for an ingredient I forgot. So I did this with equal parts fish sauce, thai chili sauce, and brown sugar instead of hoisin, then cut back on the red pepper flakes. I also used baby broccoli instead of broccolini, and frozen, defrosted shrimp, which allowed me to skip the first step. I'll keep this one in my recipe box!

I've made a dish similar to this at home with a variety of fresh vegetables along with the brocollini and I love it. The person that said it didn't appeal to them needs to learn that a great deal of the fun in cooking is experimenting. What could you have done to make it better?

I tried my hand at the wok using this recipe and it was delicious! I used regular broccoli. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we won't be visiting Hunan restaurants anytime soon.
