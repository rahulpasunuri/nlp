LOVED this. Peeling the tomatoes did take a while; I think 5 seconds per batch is better than 3, since the few that did blanch for longer were easier to peel. However, I suspect it's a case of YMMV, and probably the best idea would be to test one or two tomatoes before committing the entire batch to a particular length of time. I had planned to use a lemon vodka, but at the last minute realized I didn't have any, and used a cucumber-flavored one instead. I used it straight (no sugar or vinegar) and pounded the salt with some toasted cumin seeds and cracked pepper. DIVINE. It's two days later, i'm eating the last of the leftovers, and they held up very well -- no soggy mess of any kind, as others have complained of. I bet different breeds of tomatoes work differently. Anyway, we adored this recipe, and my guests scarfed almost every single one.

These were delicious and strangely addicting. I used Citron Vodka (thanks to other reviewers who suggested using flavored vodka). Yes, it does take some time to peel the tomatoes, but it's worth it. I just made one basket of tomatoes and it didn't take that long. I served them in a large martini glass to ooh's and oh's. They are cute and quite the novelty, but then when you pop it in your mouth its quite a surprise. Even a little on the sweet side, but definitely delicious. I will make this again for a party.

I really wanted these to be terrific and they just weren't. I followed the recipe to the letter - used yellow cherry tomatoes from the farmer's market. I peeled them as per recipe and they were firm and lovely, pale yellow. They were really good at first (1 hr), but they just collapsed after awhile (3 hr mark from prep time to halfway through the party) and were deflated and swimming in a sea of yellow tomato juice. I threw in a few unpeeled/pierced tomatoes just for comparison and they held up better and were just as good. I liked the vodka/tomato combo but would not go to the trouble of peeling again.

I was making making tomatoes like these years and years ago. Except I called mine "Bloody Mary's on a Stick". I would stick mine with a "stick pretzel" right before serving. Also I didn't use the vinegar and sugar. I put a drop of Tabasco in the vodka. They were an appetizer that went really fast.

Our friends rolled in last night after taking the "scenic route" (oops! misprogrammed GPS, it turns out) from Baltimore to Boston. Imagine their delight after that trip to be treated to these tipsy tomatoes. I only made a pint's worth for 4 and the blanching & peeling was done in 5 minutes. I've logged on to e-mail them the requested recipe.

I had friends who poked the cherry tomatoes, then soaked in a bowl of vodka. We would spear them with toothpicks, then roll in Kosher salt. The perfect accompaniment to the vodka martinis that they served! (I can see using seasoned salt, although we never did.)

I've made this several times & it is a ton of fun. I brought several different salts, peppers & spices (anything I'd typically put in a bloody mary...cumin, etc.). Very interactive and fun. Of course, I also upped the amount of vodka.

I made this recipe exactly as is. I alternated threading a tomatoe with small mozzarella balls on a toothpick - cute presentation, tasty combo. Wouldn't recommend marinading for more than and hour as the vodka flavor is very overpowering.

My guests were quite impressed with this appetizer and asked for the recipe after only two tomatoes! Blanching was easier than other reviewers' experiences, and quite fast if you have help. Will make again, and try adding hot pepper and/or use pepper vodka. Worth the effort in my book!!

I've been making a variation on this for years. I use the grape tomatoes, and instead of peeling them, I just pierce them a few times with a toothpick. Serve with Old Bay seasoning for dipping. It's like snacking on tiny, delicious, Bloody Marys.

This dish was good...but ABSOLUTELY not worth the effort. Peeling the tomatoes is a pain, and takes FOREVER. While I thought the cherry tomatoes were good, they were not good enough to justify all the time spent blanching and peeling.

I made this for our annual Labor Day party last year and it has been requested for numerous get togethers since then. They are YUMMY! I always use large grape tomatoes unless I have cherry tomatoes in the garden--more flavorful. Also use good vodka (we use Grey Goose) and good sea salt like fleur de sel. Always a big hit!

I must have done something wrong since I found this recipe to be rather bland.

This was the hit of the party. Made with slightly big cherry tomatoes. Maybe a pain to peel the tomatoes but worth it, even with cheap vodka. I put out a couple of fancy salts for dipping as well. Good stuff.

These were tasty but not worth all the effort - a waste of good vodka.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party. People hovered around it and soon all were gone! Extremely easy to make with a fun, tasty and unique result.

My favorite hors d'oeuvres recipe. In fact, I had the caterer specially make these for my wedding reception. Can't give a better endorsement than that! Any small tomato will do, but don't use crap vodka, or you might as well douse them in gasoline.

I loved this, a little tideous to peel the tomatoes - yes, but on the other hand it's easy to halve the recepie and there's still enough for a small party to enjoy these little darlings. I blanched for a little longer than 3 secs, which makes it easier, just make sure the tomatoes don't get mushy.

We made the "mistake" of using grape-tomatoes, which were VERY time consuming to peel, but the tip of making an "x" with a knife and blanching them, etc, really worked, and they tasted perfectly fine... they just took a LONG time to make. We also made a second batch and used cherry tomatoes, and they were much easier to peel (using the same method described)... they were a big hit at our Engagement Party, and leftovers came out at an Easter Sunday brunch the next day, and were just as enjoyable the second time around! YUM!

These are great! I used "cocktail tomatoes" - sometimes sold in a mesh bag, and just a little bigger than cherry tomatoes. I worked in small batches - blanched 5, peeled 5 (under ice water - the skins slip off more easily) - they were done pretty quickly. Absolut Citron vodka added even more of a lemon note; intend to try these with a pepper-flavored vodka next time.

While others at my party seemed to like these, I found them too boozy and too sweet. And peeling cherry tomatoes is time consuming!

Despite the cramped hand I had after peeling all the tomatoes (and I halved the recipe), I'd still make it again. They were delicious, fun, and evoked many oohs and ahs at a New Year's Eve party. Next time, though, I'd make sure there would be more people - and more drinkers - at the party before making this one - I ended up throwing a lot of them away.

I used small grape tomatoes, made deep X-cuts but did not peel. After a 3-hour marinade (which included a little salt) the tomatoes remained very firm, they were easy to handle and flavorful. Good reason to break out the expensive Fleur de sel.

These are so good -all my friends are talking about them. I too added the salt in the vodka mix instead of using for dipping. I presented them in a glass trifle bowl and they looked very elegant. Highly recommend making and a great recipe to experiment with flavors.

Peeling the tomatoes is time-consuming, but it's worth the work. Zesty, intriguing...great party treat.

I make this over and over again, especially in the summer. It is a light accompanyment to cocktails. I get raves every time I serve.

Great recipe. I got tired of peeling the tomatoes so there was about a pint that were not peeled. Next time I will peel all of them! They really absorb the flavors better when peeled. Next time I am going to add some horseradish. I kinda like dipping them in the salt, although I agree with another reviewer and if you're not carefull, the salt can overpower the taste. The guests got a nice buzz off this recipe!!!!

I ran out of time and didn't peel the tomatoes, but they still marinated well. I also divided them into different batches and made them with different flavored vodkas - citron, pepper, etc. - it was amazing the taste differences and everyone RAVED! It was fun trying out the different ones, I would definitely do this again and even put them in a salad or something that calls for cherry tomatoes.

DON'T follow this recipe as is!!! The first time I made it, I made a mistake and mixed the salt in at the same time as the sugar. That's the way to do it! (No pepper.) If you dip in a salt and pepper mix, all you can taste is salt and pepper. My way gives heavenly tomato flavor, is much less messy to eat(no dipping) and rather sexy--there's something about those gleaming naked tomatoes...mmmm. The third time I made it, I put a couple of peels of lemon zest in the vodka-vinager mix rather than grating, worked fine, and it's such a fiddly sort of recipe anyway, what with all that skin peeling, that anything to simplify seems worth mentioning.

Oops - my mistake - I meant to rate the recipe for "Pepper-Vodka-Soaked Cherry Tomatoes With Seasoned Sea Salt". THOSE were inedible. Haven't tried these.

This recipe was excellent! The sweetness of the tomatos in vodka is beautifully balanced by the gutsy saltiness of the pepper salt. My guests were quite addicted to them. Only downside was that you have to give guests "instructions" on how to dip them. The recipe says to marinate them no more than 1 hour before serving. Mine still were crisp and firm 6 hours into the party, so if you had to start earlier, its ok.
