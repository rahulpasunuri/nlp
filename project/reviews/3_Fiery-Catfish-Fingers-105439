Using a cup of mustard is absurd, 2 to 3 tablespoons is more than enough to coat and marinate 1 1/2 lbs of fish. Why waster all of that mustard???

While I thought this recipe was tastey, it lacked the fire! I will make this again,but next time I will add cayenne or cajun seasoning to the coating.

I loved this recipe. Wouldn't make it any other way now. I just moved to New Orleans and they know how to make catfish here. This is great.

Delicious! We used whole egg and 2 TABLESPOONS Tobasco sauce. We will definitely be making this again--perhaps coating other fish fillets or shrimp.

I saw this recipe on your show and couldn't wait to make it. But, something about mustard and fish. It didn't go over too well in my house, the cats wouldn't even eat it.

I followed this recipe exactly and couldn't even discern the tabasco sauce when done. I would definitely atleast double the amount (I don't even like spicy foods). Catfish is an ideal choice because it comes out soft and flaky. I would use a little tabasco when done for spice.
