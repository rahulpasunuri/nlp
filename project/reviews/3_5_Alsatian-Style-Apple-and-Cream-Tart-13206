My family loved this tart! We made a 12" version and, even after increasing the recipe by 1/3, found that the crust was still alittle skimpy. The raisins didn't add much and did burn. But other than that, it was delicious and elegant.

I made this a couple of weeks ago to rave reviews. I am making it again this weekend for a French- inspired dinner, but as someone else said, there are enough ingredients for a larger tart. I will use my bigger tart pan this next time.

This was a lovely tart - the only things I would do differently would be to wrap the tart pan with foil when I poured the custard in and omit the raisins.

Very nice and elegant presentation. Surprisingly simple to make. I added dried cranberries with the golden raisins which added a nice bite.

This is a beautiful dessert. But beyond it's pretty face, it is so tasteless! I would only call this "good for grammas" - meaning that if you want simple and straightforward, it will work, and be lovely, but it definitely needs more flavor. Almond extract in the custard is a great idea, and/or sprinkled over the top. Sorry Syracuse, "delicate" doesn't mean "tasty" - more cinnamon or nutmeg could be overpowering if poorly done, but to me that beats boring. Although I couldn't get apples cut in 1/8ths to fit in a 9" tart pan in any decorative pattern, it was still very attractive when I basically just piled them in, but slicing the apples differently could be of benefit. Finally, perennial problem with pastry-crust tarts is the custard leaks out the holes you poke in the crust and makes the oven and pan very sticky and messy. I was pleased to take this to a party - it looked impressive, but only half of it got eaten by 12 people, and I was disappointed with it overall.

Lovely way to incorporate a custard base and apples. I omitted raisins and used almond extract in the filling which greatly complements the apples.

This took me back to the apple "pies" my french au pairs used to make. Few Americans realize that apples can benefit from this delicate treatment, and not be overwhelmed with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. One caveat, I never had an authentic French apple tart with raisins in it, so I omitted them.

I made two of these the first time for a French class when I was a junior in high school. They turned out great except that I had to pick the raisins off of the top because they burned. Since I baked them one at a time, I didn't even put raisins in the second one which a lot people actually liked better. I would definitely make it again though

I would make this again, but not as is. The second time I made this I used regular old fashioned shortening pie crust without prebaking it. Came out a lot better. I also put the raisins (not in the cream) into the crust before arranging the apples. Doing it the way the recipe calles for leaves the raisin exposed on top and they burn - a taste not very appealing to me.

I am thinking about trying this recipe, but would like to know if it will serve 14 people? would appreciate an answer ASAP. Our gourmet club meets March 25; need to get the recipe to one of the members who will be assigned the dessert.

This was delicious. I would try a 10 inch pan next time as I had leftover pate brisee, apples and cream. I finished the pate brisee in the processor and I think you could do the whole thing in it.

This very rich and delicious apple tart is very simple to make. I have used this dessert at a number of dinner parties and it never fails to make a major impression. Make sure you use an apple that won't go to mush after baking.
