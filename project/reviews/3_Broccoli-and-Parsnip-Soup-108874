Admittedly I only used this recipe as a jumping off point. It seemed like way too much water (as others have mentioned)... and way too many steps. Instead I sauteed a yellow onion, a medium sized turnip that I needed to use up, the parsnips and broccoli stems in olive oil til golden... while I blanched the broccoli florets in water just in case I needed the liquid. I did not... so next time I'd just do the whole bit together. I also added two sliced garlic cloves and let them saute just til fragrant, then dropped in the bouquet garni and some chicken stock and let it simmer for a while. Salt, plenty of pepper... blended up with my hand blender and it was great. Green and peppery and fragrant.... We passed some crispy bacon, sharp grated cheddar and scallions as garnish. So.. although it's not the same recipe, it is a nice combination that I would put together again. I encourage you to do the same and get creative. :-)

I sauteed the onions before adding the water, chicken broth and parsnips. I thought it was delicious.

Just finsihed making this recipe and it is very watery and has no flavor. Should have recognized a soup with 6 C. of water would taste like water.

This was lovely, light, and creamy with a little kick of spice from the parsnip. I did add some cream, too. You have to enjoy and be grateful of the flavors of each vegetable. It is a great soup... I also lightly fried some sage leaves in olive oil as a garnish. I will be making this again--for my family!

I found this bland, but then added a little cream (maybe two tablespoons) and the same amount of fresh lemon juice. It made a huge difference, and I loved the soup!

My husband said it: "boring." I found it a mish-mash; broccoli & parsnips just don't seem meant for each other, & nutmeg doesn't help them out any.

Like others have said, the soup ends up rather thin. I also found it fairly bland so just before serving I decided to puree some roasted red peppers and swirl that into the soup. Much tastier. Then I decided to grate some aged gouda cheese into the bowls as I served the soup. With these additions a bland boring soup was salvaged.

This soup had little taste and was thin in consistency. Healthy doesn not mean devoid of taste. A waste of good vegetables.

Although I only gave this a rating of 2, I would make it again for the health factor - all those good veggies. In fact, it's probably a 2 to 3. Next time, I'll decrease the liquid, as it's too thin, even though I did not return the one cup of liquid after cooking. I'd decrease the original water by one cup. Naturally, as others stated, it would be better with some cream, but I plan to stick with the low-fat version.

A heallthy 3 1/2 stars. One wishes that this website allowed one to see other reviews posted by [jessica]. I'd love to know what else she thinks sounds bad, because clearly she has no taste. This is a superb soup that will please just about everyone. We made the vegetarian version, using powdered mock chicken stock from Whole Foods. It was fine. I agree that more salt is necessary. Next time I make it I'm going to bake a few chestnuts and crumble them on top, possibly with a small swirl of shallot infused clarified butter. But this is a great soup as is- quick, simple, and satisfying.

Well, jessica, nothing like rating a recipe by how it "sounds" - do you recite the menu rather than serve food??? This is a nice and basic soup with the unexpected taste of parsnips - they aren't a popular veggie! If you use low sodium broth and no salt, it will taste too bland.

We loved this recipe, it's so healthy and easy to make. Instead of the one cup of liquid to thin we added one cup of 1/2 and 1/2. Makes it not so low fat, but very creamy and good!

The soup was delicious, unusual and had a nice bite to it (spicy) Easy to make. I did not follow the measurements exactly but the consistency was perfect.

This recipe comes out as too thin when followed to the letter, but it can be thickened with a 1/4-cup of mashed or 1 tblsp. of flaked potatoes. The soup is good tasting, but its flavor is improved with stock (rather than canned broth) or the addition of chopped ham.

Very easy to make and it is excellent! Not something you would see every day either. Thank you!

Me Again.....this soup is awesome! I can't believe how complicated people make things....It's a really simple dish. I only used 5 cups of broth(not water) and the consistency was perfect....it was delicious.....anyhow, you do have to try it....parsnips do have a future other than as a roast or stewed root veggie!!!

This was a nice healthy recipe but pretty bland. There are too many other soup recipes to try to bother with this one unless it can be doctored up alot.

Used the basic recipe with leftover steamed broccoli,cauliflour and carrots. Pureed and added a little cream. Not much, just to enrich.
