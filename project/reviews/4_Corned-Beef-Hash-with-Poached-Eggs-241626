An excellent follow up recipe to the homemade roasted corned beef and vegetables recipe. I did cook 4 strips of bacon for the grease in addition to a bit of leftover fat trimmings, but I did not add the bacon or the fat solids to the final recipe. I added 2/3 cup of green bell peppers with the red onion. Then scrambled 4 eggs with the mixture instead of 2 because my kids (ages 2 & 4) would not have eaten it if it didn't resemble scrambled eggs. Overall an excellent recipe with lots of good veggies to boot.

Question: Some ingredients say "reserved from corned beef". Is the idea that you are using leftovers from roasted corned beef and vegetables?

Good basic CB&H recipe. This a versitile recipe that can go many flavorful ways. Try some good picante for a southwest bite.
