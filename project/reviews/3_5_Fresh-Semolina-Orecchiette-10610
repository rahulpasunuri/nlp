I love making fresh pasta! Made these for the Spinach and Lentils with Orecchiette recipe on here. I too go with thinner slices, and it helps to have at least one helper, to make it easier on the thumbnail. I find mine is stressed by the repeated pressing and twisting. I add a little EV olive oil with the water as it seems criminal not to. For any pasta, tasting is the only way to judge the cooking time. For fresh I let them return to the boil and start checking after another minute or two depending upon how delicate they are.

These have become a standby for us. I roll them off a fork because it is easier on my hands than pressing with my thumb. I also try to cut them a bit thinner than suggested - they can be doughy otherwise.

This was a good recipe. I did half recipe using 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 1/2 c. white flour, and 1 c. semolina about 1 tsp of sea salt. We were unsure of cooking time (took about 9-10 mins) and had to keep sampling them. I would make them a bit thinner next time - by cutting them to 1/2 inch wide and then shaping them, they were still a bit heartier than I would have liked. From the half recipe we used half the dough, which made 2 large serving sizes. Will try the rest tonight cut to fettucine!

One of the better pasta recipes I've used. I had to add a little bit of extra water to get the right consistency but I found that it worked well for both ravioli and fettucine.

This recipe was excellent. I doubled it to make more than enough pasta for four when tossed with sausage, broccoli rabe and romano. Making the orecchiette was easier than I expected, but be sure to leave plenty of time in case you're moving slowly. I let the formed pasta can sit for hours under a kitchen towel at room temperature, and it did not dry out.
