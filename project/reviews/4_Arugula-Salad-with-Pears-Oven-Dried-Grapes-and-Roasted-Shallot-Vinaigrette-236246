Seedless grapes have very little flavor to me. Roasting them this way improved them enormously. Cutting the oil down to 1/2 cup was perfect. I blended half very fruity olive oil and half extra light olive oil as a blend to avoid the dressing being too heavy tasting. This recipe will be added to my go-to collection.

This was just good for me. If I make it again, I will add some toasted pecans and a sprinkle of blue cheese as some other reviewers suggested.

This was superb! Made it as a side for "Tenderloin Steaks with Cranberry-Port Sauce and Gorgonzola Cheese" along with "Yukon Gold and Fennel Puree with Rosemary Butter" and it was excellent. I took the advise of a couple reviewers and sauteed the pears (I used Asian pears) in a little butter and sugar). Next time I may skip the grapes as I don't think they added enough to the salad to justify roasting them for 2 1/2 hours.

This salad is fabulous. Don't be fooled by the taste of the dressing alone. When combined with the peppery arugula, sweet grapes, and pears it is wonderful! So easy to roast the shallots and grapes the day before.

Worth the time!

Just served this salad for a formal dinner party to rave reviews. The grapes were a new flavor-complex and sweet too. I took the suggestion of others and sauteed the pears, which I cut in quarters, in butter with a touch of sugar and a handful of whole pecans. Then topped off the presentation with a wedge of blue cheese. The combination of flavors was sublime.

delicious...it's easier to prep the grapes and shallots a couple of days ahead. once these are ready it's a piece of cake.

I made the salad as is and it was good but I think it needs a nut and/or cheese with it to make it memorable. With the above additions I think the salad would be really great.

My family could not get over the "high-end" salad I served when I made this salad as a light starter for Thanksgiving dinner. I did cut the olive oil in the dressing to 1/2 cup, and feel that the sherry vinegar is a must to bring out the flavor of the roasted shallots. Also I used a little more salt and served a bowl of crumbled blue cheese along side for those who wanted to add it. I did and it was fabulous! Toasted walnuts or pecans would be a nice addition if there are no allergy concerns.

Excellent salad. Flavors blend perfectly. Everyone loves it, and I wouldn't change a thing.

Just made it tonight. Very good recipe, however, I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup. I would use less roasted shallots, the texture of the vinaigrette was grainy and too thick for the small arugula leaves. Also, I used a comice pear, which is super sweet, but I should have used a firmer flesh variety. The pears broke down in the dressing, adding to the strange texture. However, the roasted grapes are brilliant...I may use them again in other recipes!

I thought this was a great recipe. Would definitely make it again. The grapes were fantastic and worked really well with the shallots.

Just finished serving this to my gourmet parents. Didn't have sherry wine vinegar and usd white wine vinegar. Turn out delish. Added blue cheese. An addition of toasted pecans would be wonderful. Grapes were sweet and a great contrast to the tartness of the vinegar in the dressing. Will make again...

The dressing tasted a little odd to me -- it lacked zing. Next time I'll use grated fresh shallots instead of roasting them. The oven-dried grapes were fabulous.

I usually don't follow a recipe to make a salad, but the reviews here were so good. Great flavor combinations. Champagne vinegar worked well, and crumbled blue cheese seemed a must. The grapes released a lot of liquid, which I poured off, reserved and used as a sweetener in the dressing instead of the honey. The grapes looked kind of limp and strange, but as they cooled their look improved.

I first had this salad at a friend's dinner party and everyone loved it - I asked for more salad and was willing to forego the entree! The sweetness of the grapes, dressing and pears is a perfect contrast to the peppery arugula. The salad is light and the slight crunch of the pears is a great texture combination with the grapes. I couldn't locate sherry vinegar originally so I substituted wine vinegar (red or white) and it was just as good. It is my new favorite spring/summer salad.

Very good salad - the oven dried grapes were really different and delicious - the pears are not even necessary. The dressing was way too strong and overpowering so I made a basic vinaigrette and added some of the shallot vinaigrette to this for a milder taste. I serve this with goat cheese crostini - yum!

I loved this recipe and also added feta or Gorganzola/blue cheese to zing it a little. Will make often as well as just making the roasted shallot dressing alone. Great!

A complete rave by everyone at the table and the oven dried grapes were such a nice textural change from raisins - a beautiful presentation too.

This salad was a hit! I actually enjoyed slow roasting the grapes and shallots the day before. Easy to do while multi-tasking. So worth it! I embellished the recipe by adding thinly sliced Manchego cheese. Dressing was perfect for this combination. I look forward to another occasion to make this again. Very impressive!

These grapes are fantastic. The salad is good, but the roasted grapes make for a unique, delicious, and special salad.

My whole family raved about this salad. Used Asian pear instead as grocery store had limited pear selection. Fabulous salad and dressing! Even the 4 year old loved it!

Made this for my husband's birthday dinner last night and we both enjoyed it. It requires quite a bit of advance time to roast the grapes and shallots, but it was worth it. I was a bit skeptical about the grapes, but they turned out to add a delicious twist. The dressing is very good and could be used on many different salads. Overall, a lovely autumn salad that I'll definitely make again.
