Bland. Tried all the suggestions in the reviews, and, it was just plain bland. Too bad we have lots of leftovers. I'm going to try smothering it with grated cheddar cheese - not much that won't fix.

I added caramelized onions to the beans, extra thyme, and Parmesan cheese to the bread crumb topping, this turned out delicious. I served it with roasted balsamic broccoli as a side. A very satisfying and tasty veggie meal.

This healthy recipee was perfect for our weekly vegetarian dinner. I served it with warm crusty rye bread and green salad with tuna and artichokes. The simmering time for the beans, however, could be cut down to 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of 1 hour 45 minutes to avoid mushy results.

This is a nice simple dish to serve as a side. I left out the sundried tomatoes and added some butter to the breadcrumb topping. I also cooked the beans until they were literally fallnig apart. A tasty filling dish!

I was hoping this would be something special, but it wasn't. It might be okay for sidedish for a weekday meal, but I would not serve this for guests.

This makes alot of food. I breaded and baked not even half the amount made in an 8x8 dish. This didn't even go for a family of 5 as a main course. Baking it seemed unnecessary since it didn't really enhance the blandness of the dish. No one wanted to try the unbaked portion. It was blah!
