Cannot be done sooner than an hour before guests arrive. Anchor melon square or round and 1/2 slice of prosciutto with a colorful toothpick. So refreshing as an appetizer on a warm Spring or Summer evening. B.J. Harrick

great summer appetizer, but I pumped the presentation and flavor by pouring over a table spoon of gin and garnishing with lime zest

Always a tasty treat! If fresh melon is unavailable, try with kiwi...equally as pleasing.

One addition: sprinkle with capers. The flavors are wonderful and this makes an excellent appetizer.
