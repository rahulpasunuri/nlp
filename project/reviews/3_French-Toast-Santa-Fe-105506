I'm so excited to have this recipe again! I remember as a little girl my father making this for the family. Our recipe had been printed in the Los Angeles Times and I've searched for years for it! Hopefully, I can re-create for my child and it can start a new tradition for us.

To Pine Valley: Somehow I don't think the French are famous for making french toast. This was a hearty dish served for a birthday breakfast. Everyone else was seated while I was finishing up in the kitchen and I almost missed out on having any. Will definitely make again.

Rich, delicious recipe. It is simple and it works fine. Very high in calories. Make with good challah bread.

Very rich, syrup and butter hardly needed. It's more like 3 minutes to get it well done. Used bakery fresh cinnamon bread as well as store bough cinnamon-swirl thick cut bread, excellent!
