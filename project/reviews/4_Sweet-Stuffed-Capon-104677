Very delicious. I used steamed chestnuts and it was wonderful. Very good way to prepare a larger chicken as well.

I am surprised to be the first to rate this. Capon ("chapon") is a traditional Christmas bird in Europe and Loomis is a noteworthy expert on French cuisine. Perhaps the "sweet" in the title is misleading. This is more savory. I used fresh, not candied chestnuts, and skipped the finicky bits e.g., turning the bird on all sides to roast - the big beast was 9 pounds and uncooperative. The results were still superb and made for a memorable Christmas feast. Try this!
