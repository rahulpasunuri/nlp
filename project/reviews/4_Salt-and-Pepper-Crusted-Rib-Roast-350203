why rub olive oil? Salt and pepper adhere just fine without it. Other thing is, salt and pepper all beef, especially a roast of this size, 12-24 hrs in advance, refridge and take out 90 mins prior to roasting. The closer it is to room temp, the better. A roast this size, only 1 hour out of fridge is not enough. You'll be amazed how much more flavorful it is than seasoning just prior to cooking.

I make this recipe at least a couple times a month but I roast it in my rotisserie - plan for 15 - 18 min/lb depending on the heat. It is FANTASTIC and almost impossible to go wrong (as long as you have a good meat thermometer and you don't cook it too long).

We have been making various rib roasts for Christmas Day for the past 15 years and this is the best. It was simple but delicious!! We made a peppercorn sauce with the meat juices, cognac, shallots, beef broth, garlic, peppercorns,a bit of Dijon mustard and heavy whipped cream - all I can say is.... it was Heaven.

I made this for our Sunday Lunch last week. It was delicious. The roasting mellowed the peppercorn crust (I was slightly worried they would fall off or be too strong - but neither happened) The few that did come off helped make a lovely gravy with the pan and resting juices from the roast. So simple and so delicious. It was a hit!

We had this on Sunday for our traditional family lunch. It was delicious. The roasting mellowed the cracked peppercorns. I was slightly worried the peppercorns would fall off during roasting but they didn't. I made a gravy with the pan and resting juices with a little red wine and extra beef stock. A hit, so simple and so delicious.

I made this for a week night dinner. For a Wednesday night it's good. For a dinner party, I think there are far better recipes to choose from. Grinding the peppercorns was difficult. I finally put them in my mini chopper and the motor started to smell from grinding. The key is you have to get the peppercorns ground finely. I thought it was good. But again not the best I've made. Next time I would use the drippings and mix with a port or red wine for a sauce.
