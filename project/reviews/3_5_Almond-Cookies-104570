"Brutti ma buoni" are a traditional type of Italian cookie from Piemonte, made with almonds and vanilla. They are perfect with a good glass of sparkling wine or a mug of coffee or hot chocolate. Usually, the traditional recipe is with the vanilla powder. Here you can find the classic recipe: http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/piemonte/brutti-buoni.aspx

Delicious and EASY!!!!! Was a big hit. Served them with Chocolate Orange Fondue and fresh fruit. I am not a baker, but these were quick and easy and I will definitely make them again.

Very good! The very soft mixture baked beautifully, and I made mine into 'log' shapes (I was serving them with an loose custard). Also halved it...still came out wonderfully!

I don't even like almonds or pine nuts, but I tried this recipe and it was delicious! Quick and easy, perfect for any occasion. Great with coffee or tea.

Perfect for a light dessert...I used a scant cup of sugar. Very quick and easy.

this was super easy to make....I didn't have pine nuts so I just used 2 +1/4c almonds. Also, didn't have cake flour so I used whole wheat pastry flour and it seemed to work fine. Also, I dusted 1/2 of them with cinnamon (generously) before baking. They turned out good enough!

Excellent and simple recipe. I didn't have pine nuts so I subbed more almonds and I reduced sugar by 1/4 cup. I think I made mine a nit bigger than they are supposed to be so they took over 15 mins to cook. They are brown on the bottom and so soft and chewy inside...even better the next day. I'll make these again for sure even if they are "ugly".

brutti ma buoni means ugly but good (not ugly but pretty as written in recipe).

I thought these were pretty good. I cut the sugar to 1 cup. I didn't think the dough would hold together but it did. I used the measuring teaspoon to scoop the dough and found that dipping the spoon in water helped keep the dough from sticking. I didn't mess with the shape once it was on the cookie sheet.

Not crazy about this cookie. It was too sweet -- more like candy.

Loved 'em. Took them to an Italian brunch and they were a hit. 12 minutes seems the best time in my oven.

These are delicious, though a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I will reduce the sugar.

Loved the cookie, however, after making it the first time I adjusted the sugar to 3/4 cup and it still is plenty sweet. My husband loves it.

I have made these cookies three times in mone month. Incredible! I prefer them on the 12 mninute side so they are soft. It is so dry in Sedona the cookies can dry out quickly after they have been cooked. That's assuming that they are around long enough. They are great with cappuccino or coffee if you like biscotti. A perfect cookie/dessert for one that likes buttery desserts yet can't take the cholesterol. They're like BUTTER!

Make some adjustments - more pine nuts, egg whites, make larger cookies, bake carefully and you will think you are in Prato.

Extremely easy to make and was the perfect light finish with tea for a fresh pasta meal. Not too sweet which we all liked. I definitely would make it again.

These cookies tasted just like pignoli cookies from the italian bakery but alot cheaper. My whole family loved them. It was like eating candy because they were crunchy. I wish there was a way to soften them just a little bit. Does anyone know how? I would definitely made again and again. Ciao!

Correction to the translation: "Brutti ma buoni" in italian means "ugly but good" not pretty.

I made these cookies to take to an Italian dinner at a friend's house. Everyone liked them, even the two young children. They were easy to make and have a good nutty flavor.
