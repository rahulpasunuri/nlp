Very good recipe that deserves at least one review! Not what I expected - I was initially thinking in terms of a cakey shortbread. This has a lot of butter and is a crisp shortbread. Just enough aniseed to make it a little sophisticated - seems like an Italian touch. So don't panic when the batter is really greasy - just pat it down to the shape you want. Could not be any easier. Cut well and was great with saucy roasted pears.
