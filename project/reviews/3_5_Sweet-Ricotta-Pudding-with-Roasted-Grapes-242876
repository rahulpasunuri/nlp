Lovely, light, and very simple dessert. I didn't want to fuss with the grapes, so used all 5 tbsp of sugar in the pudding. For extra flavour I added 1 tsp vanilla, the zest of one lemon, and served it with fresh strawberries. I used cornmeal instead of breadcrumbs and 3 eggs as suggested. I plan to try it again with a graham cracker crust.

I added an extra egg at the suggestion of another reviewer, but otherwise made this as written and got rave reviews from everyone at dinner. The flavor is in the grapes, not the pudding. This is pretty and very simple. Will definitely make this a stand by.

Outstanding recipe. The roasted grapes were amazing. I wish the pudding was more risen. Maybe egg whites? That aside, fantastic.

I thought it was delicious as written, however I will add more pine nuts the next time. I also thought that the grapes were not very good the following days. As a substitution, I drizzled it with a bit of home made blueberry-blackberry syrup and it was quite delicious!

I followed mdbgy9's suggestions about the extra ricotta and egg and was glad I did. This has almost a custardy consistency, but drier and definitely less sweet. My husband and son both wished for more flavor, although I added some whipped cream on top of the grapes. I think this might taste quite good if it had a pie-crust base to vary the consistency and add more flavor. I liked the taste, but not enough to make again.

Made savory, nutmeg instead of cinnamon, cherry tomatoes instead of grapes and a little basil. Omitted sugar, but a little honey with the cheese. It was quite tasty, wished it had been thicker, next time 3 eggs and 2+ cups of ricotta.
