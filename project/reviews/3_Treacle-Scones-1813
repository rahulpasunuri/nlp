These are lovely, I had no buttermilk so added a little lemon juice to plain milk and baked as recommended but foir only 12 minutes which was ample.

Where's the treacle in this recipe? I have treacle in the cupboard, but the recipe says to use molasses. Can I just substitute?

When sugar is refined the liquid is squeezed from the sugar cane and is boiled in stages to remove the sugar crystals. The thick brown syrup leftover is molasses. The third and final stage of boiling leaves blackstrap molasses with the least amount of sugar, but the most nutrients. It has a tart-bitter flavor and is used commonly in animal feed.

To the cook who reviewed 12/12/2000: Blackstrap molasses has a VERY strong flavor. (It is the first batch of juice that comes from raw sugar cane - very unrefined.) If you use it in anything, your baked goods will have an overwhelming molasses flavor - don't use it.

How do you sift brown sugar??? I added it to the other sifted ingredients. Microwave the molasses and butter... it is much simpler. Finally, 425* resulted in black scones. However, they did smell good enough to try again. I found 375* did the trick... VERY GOOD!
