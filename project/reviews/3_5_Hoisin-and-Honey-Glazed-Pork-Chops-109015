Read the ingredients for this recipe, went out and bought the hoisin and scallions (only things missing from pantry) only to get home and find I didn't have the called for amount of oyster sauce. I included what I had, a little black bean sauce and a tbsp more of soy sauce to make up liquid amounts. Otherwise did everything the same. My pork chops were a little on the the thinner side so only cooked for the 15 mins before switching to broil. These turned out great. Moist and flavourful. My kids, ages 11 & 13, loved them too.

This is a go-to weeknight recipe in my house and is a wonderful (not to mention healthier and less expensive) alternative to ordering Chinese take- out. The pork chops always come out juicy and the dijon and fresh ginger add a nice zing. My husband, who is from Hong Kong, loves it!

I was a little skeptical about mixing all of those flavors together, but I follwod the recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The pork chops were perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender and we thought the sauce was delicious. Although many reviewers did not like the dijon mustard, I found that it cut through some of the sweetness of the hoisin and honey and made the dish more savory.

Very tasty-- added garlic and marinated for about 5 hours. I didn't broil, but the flavor was amazing and the whole family enjoyed it. It did take longer, so be sure to use a meat thermometer.

Made this with pork tenderloin because I am looking for an asian pork recipe for my niece's wedding reception. I would either reduce or leave out the dijon and will try it again with some kind of acid, maybe lime. I grilled the pork and then brushed on the sauce near the end.

These chops have long been a favorite with my family. Definitely add a little garlic to the recipe and the flavor really pops if you use Maille's Dijon mustard. Also be sure to use low sodium soy sauce or it may get too salty.

This is one of my family's favorites. A delightful blend of flavors makes the pork chops simply delicious. I make this recipe over and overagain. We also like to add extra scallion. It is always enjoyed by everyone!

Next time I will omit the Dijon as it negated all of the Asian flavors.

I have made this dish many times. I leave out the dijon, marinate the chops overnight, and grill them when it is warm enough out. Cooked in the oven, I got a rating of "okay" from family, grilled they think it's fabulous.

Easy, quick. Had to substitute dried ginger for fresh and regular onion for scallions because I didn't have time to run to the store. still turned out nicely.

This was pretty good but next time, I will scrape off some of the sauce (not spoon it on as directed) because it is a bit salty and overpowering. Also, broiled as directed, and the scallions all came out burnt.

This was an amazing recipe. I knew when I first read it that the ingredients would work well together with the pork. I just added two cloves of garlic that a chopped up finely. The chops carmelized beautifully. I served the chops with a butternut squash ravioli and aparagus. My family absolutely loved this recipe!

I took the advice of previous cooks and added garlic, not to the sauce, but directly on the chops. A tasty dish, but next time I will marinate the chops. I tried the sauce with salmon, however, and it was very tasty.

Way too salty! I don't know if it's because I used lite soy sauce or what I did wrong, but there are many other dishes with hoisin and pork that are much better.

This dish has become our favorite way to eat pork. The flavors are excellent. We have made it for guests more than once and they have all raved and left with a copy of the recipe. Definitely a fun and different twist on pork.

Thought this would be an interesting twist on asian flavors (there's nothing like this in chinese cooking culture AFAIK). The hoisin sauce is overpowering. 3 of the people I tried it on said it was just ok and the 4th hated it. The pork did come out nice and moist though. There has to be a way to make pork chops taste good and keep them moist but this isn't it...

Rating: 2
The pork was tender, but I thought the sauce had an unpleasant flavor. I love hoisin sauce (and all of the ingredients), but the combination was not good. My husband loved it, which is why I give it 2 instead of only 1 fork. My son, who loves chinese flavors, wouldn't eat it.

Actually found this in my enormous pile of clipped recipes, not online... the photo looked delicious! Made them as written... very good, quick, and simple. I would like the sauce more with garlic and sesame oil. The chops took about 18 min, plus about 3 min broiling. I turned off the broiler before the chops were carmelized, because I had no sauce left... it all basically carmelized/burned on the pan. However, there was enough "piled" on top of the chops to make them tasty and moist. Served with sauteed zucchini and brown rice. I will make them again.

Rating: 2
A nice mix of flavors and a pleasant alternative to most pork chop recipes. I followed the recipe with no changes. It wasn't a big thriller, but was reasonably well received by the whole family. I'm sure I'll make it again when I'm in the mood for something a little different.

This recipe was so easy to make and the flavors were excellent! Quick, easy and good, who could ask for more?

I enjoyed this recipe a great deal. Very easy and quick to make. Start making your rice first and this recipe will be done by the time the rice is cooked. The oven time should be reduced about 5 minutes because of the extra time it spends on the broiler. When I made it, it was a little well done but still delicious. The sauce is sweet and salty and works very well with the pork chops.

My 12-year-old son thanked me for dinner tonight -- note bad for a sometimes surly 'tween! The reviewers who wrote that Oyster Sauce was just salty brown sauce probably think that Worchestershire sauce is merely salty brown sauce! I found a recipe online for oyster sauce that actually uses oysters (as my genuine Cantonese oyster sauce ingredients list) as a base. Go to http://chinesefood.about.com/library/blrecipe282.htm (BTW--since I can easily buy oyster sauce, I haven't tried to make it as yet.)

I finally found a dish with scallions that I like. I didn't have the oyster sauce, so I just increased the other ingredients to compensate. I've had to increase the roasting time to allow for the thickness of the chops I had, but still a very easy recipe. The fresh ginger adds some brightness to the dish, powdered was still good, but not as good. Definitely a winner!

Rating: 3
I combined this recipe with another, and my husband and I both loved it. I made the sauce with some dried ginger (didn't have any fresh), but otherwise as written, sprinkled more dried ginger and garlic powder on a small pork loin and seared it first, then roasted it for almost an hour with the sauce (400 dgs, turning roast over after 30 minutes). Didn't even have to put it in the broiler, the sauce was already carmalized and delicious!

Made this for dinner last night and it was easy and tasty. Did not have fresh ginger, but had a jar of pickled ginger in my refrigerator ( am experimenting with making sushi which is why i have it on hand), and the flavor was excellent. the pickled ginger has an intense, but delicious flavor. will definatly make again. Also, marinated the pork chops for 4 hours, and then put on my George Forman grill - simple, and easy clean up.

I have made recipes that called for oyster sauce with/without it. Personally, I think it is just a salty brown sauce. I haven't found much difference just increasing the soy sauce instead. Alter the amounts to your taste. (I always use reduced sodium.) The item that really adds a good flavor to these dishes is the hoisin.

Don't be afraid of the oyster sauce. We were brave and added it. You don't taste it, it was just part of a great sauce. My family (including three kids) loved these.

For those who have a hard time finding oyster sauce but still want an asian-style pork chop recipe - check out the teriyaki pork chops with pineapple-papaya relish on this website. It's more Japanese-style (rather than Chinese) with basic ingredients - although for all you foodies out there, I am very aware that neither is 'authentic' but who cares? Food should be celebrated in all forms. I like the sound of Karen's suggestions (below) and look forward to trying this out.

Rating: 4
The recipe was very good. I like my pork chops on the sweet side so I added one tablespoon of dark brown sugar and one tablespoon ketchup for a little more red coloring. Also, I seared the chops in a grill pan before baking, made them very tender. My huisband said they were the best chops he has ever eaten. I would make them for company.

These pork chops make a great week night meal. I've made them twice, but last time I was out of oyster sauce so I substituted mirin. They still tasted good but I think they're better with the oyster sauce. I served them with rice and stir fried asian greens.

This recipe tastes great and it is also easy! I picked up the ingredients on my way home from work and had dinner on the table in less than an hour.My husband's comment was "you can make this anytime"! The only change I made was to add the garlic as previously suggested. I am going to try it with boneless chicken breasts as well.

I made this dish and it was tasty. Unfortunately I tried to find oyster sauce here in Holland, but did not have any luck. I just used a bit more soy sauce , some chop garlic and a tad of sesame oil. I marinaded them over night and they were great! If anyone has a recipe to make a homemade oyster sauce or a suggestion as to what I could use as a substition, please email me. I would appreciate any suggestion! I certainly will make this again soon.

Gave this recipe 4 forks solely due to my husband's raves. I am vegetarian and like Beethoven, prepare meat dishes blindly without tasting. Made this following recipe exactly except for 1) no hoisin sauce and 2) only 3 pork chops (only 3 would fit in my dish). He thought it was one of the best meat dishes he's ever had! I will definitely try adding rice vinegar next time +/- sesame oil.

I don't think there is a substitute for oyster sauce, although there are vegetarian versions made with mushrooms and other flavorings. It is pretty easy to find oyster sauce in just about any grocery store these days.

Used two butter-fly pork loin chops a little thicker than called for, one pound total, marinted as suggested for about 4 hours, and cooked a little longer, and they came out great; looked just like the photo and juicy. Was a bit worried about the funk-factor with that oyster sauce, but the finished sauce was tasty and got all sopped up.

I used Pork Tenderloin Cut into Medallions and quickly seared in the frying pan - then covered and finished to Med. Rare. Also added garlic and should have added a little more ginger.

My boyfriend loves pork chops, so I am always looking for new ways to cook them. This is an excellent method and we both liked the sauce. I added garlic and sesame oil to the marinade, and also used only two chops leaving extra sauce to spoon over steamed broccoli and mashed sweet potatoes.

I agree that I think this recipe works best with two chops instead of the four because that way you have sufficient enough sauce to spoon over the pork. I used boneless pork loins and then sliced them thinly and layered the slices across brown rice. Topped both servings with extra sauce and garnished with chopped fresh parsley. Served with roasted sugar snap peas. It was a hit. I also marinated the pork in the sauce all day in a ziploc.Will certainly make again

Used this marinade on two 1" thick chops last night, adding a splash of rice vinegar and garlic as others did. Placed them in a hot skillet which was preheated in the oven, rendering a nice quick sear to the meat. Also, turned them halway through the cooking time. A final minute or two on broil was all it needed to finish it off. Used only the white part of scallion, and think that sliced shallots would also work well.

Rating: 3
When you read the word "hoisin" in the title that should be your clue for distinctive Asian flavor, not ranch dressing crusted shake n bake or whatever. The marinade is wonderful, especially if you follow other reviewers' tips and add any of the suggestions: sesame oil, garlic, vinegar. I'm not so much a fan of this recipe but of the sauce that has supplanted my Soy Vay teriyaki and marinades.

This is, overall a good recipe. However, after experimenting with various methods, the best chops to use were from a whole pork loin rack cut by hand into double cut chops. I also found that substituting hoisin sauce for the oyster sauce worked better, as did grfilling the chops on a charbroiler.

I rate this recipe 4 forks because I think this method of cooking pork chops is a significant improvement on my previous method of braising pork chops on top of the stove. This method is quicker, not as messy, uses less fat and produces superior chops. The sauce is tasty but may not suit everyone's personal taste or health concerns. It seems to me that one could improvise many yummy variations. I left out the honey and the oyster sauce on my first trial and loved the result. On the second trial, I experimented a bit more and still had a great dish. I used 1/2 inch chops on the first trial and 1 inch chops on the second trial. I brined the chops the second time around, which made for juicier meat.

I found this recipe on epicurious's web site and tried it out today 1-23-04. It was easy and quick to put together. The hoisin sauce and the oyster sauce are new to me and I was leary of trying it. But I always told my kids to not be afraid to try something new so I had to try it. The whole combination turned out to be GREAT. I followed the recipe, cooking the chops for 20 minutes and broil for 5. This will be a regulare on our menue.

Sorry I would not make this dish again. It did not take long to make and I thought it would be good because of the other reviews. It was not dry but it just was not good. Even went to Whole Foods and bought special 1" thick, bone-in beautiful chops.

Fantastic recipe! I had some gorgeous, Frenched, 2-rib-on, nicely marbled and thick chops that were oh-so tender and tasty. Bone-in really contributes so much flavour! I added 2 large cloves grated garlic, 1 tbsp. sesame oil and a splash of rice vinegar to the sauce, poured over the chops and marinated 5 hours before roasting, otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I will add the scallions later as I didn't care for their colour and texture - almost blackish and so limp - would be much better if sprinkled on closer to the end of the roasting time. Served with Wasabi Garlic Spinach Mashed Potatoes (from the Food Network and so yummy), sauteed Chinese green beans with mushrooms and red peppers, and a cooling/refreshing cucumber and bean sprout salad. It was a great dinner that had my husband "licking his chops"! Think this would also work well with chicken or pork tenderloin. Enjoy!

I passed by this in the magazine but after all of the great reviews in the Top 30 I had to try it. Very easy and it looked great on the plate with rice and sauted spinach.

We'll definitely make this again - great taste, quick and easy.

I used pork chops a little larger than 1" thick, cooked in convection oven at 380 degrees. I was paranoid about earlier reviewer who commented the chops were over cooked, so checked after 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. As it was, I had to cook the pork for 25 minutes. I'm guessing the actual time in the receipe for 1" chops is accurate.
