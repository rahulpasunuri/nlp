Deliciously simple. Making beets and soaking in dressing the night before works really well, too. Also tried this with sauteed kale, and was a delicious combination.

Really good and easy, I crumbled some goat cheese over the top for a little tang. For next time a sliced grilled chicken breast would be good.

My husband and I liked it and one of the children. I served it over raw spinach with the red onion. Used jarred ginger, next time I think I'll use fresh.

This is a terrific recipe. I made just one modification, however. I wilted the spinch for about 30 seconds and then piled on the beets and onions. I served this as part of a large, sit-down dinner party for a dozen people. There was one lonely teaspoon left! A tasty, colorful, flavorful side. Yum, yum.

changed the recipe to steam the spinach instead of serve it fresh as a salad. worked well with the roasted beets. one note, if you go this route: definitely cut back on the beets. the spinach was perfect for 2 people (as in we ate twice as much as the recipie calls for) but we had double the beetes we needed. if you go this route you can serve over brown rice. skip the onions.

Well, I thought this was good, but my husband is currently making a PB&J because his plate is still full on the table. Branching out definitely backfired for me today. If you are a beet-lover, however, do give this a try.

The ginger vinaigrette was very nice and gave the beets that much needed kick.

Excellent. I forgot to put the onions in but it still came out great.

We love beets and ginger a prefect combination in our household. I made it for our favorite chef friend in the Napa Valley and she loved it.

This was a very nice and attractive salad.....tangy dressing, and pretty colors. I did it with red and yellow beets. It was a hit with my beet-loving guests!

This salad is great as is. This time, however, I added two hard boiled eggs and used 1 1/2 T of veg oil and 1/2 T of seseme oil. Also for speed, I used bottled ginger. Yummy!

A very nice beet salad, great for a luncheon. Got rave reviews from all I've served it to.

Not a bad salad (how can it be given that it has roasted beets, yum!), but we prefer the taste of beet salads accompanied by balsamic or miso vinaigrettes.

This is one good looking, tasty salad. I've made this for two clients, and they both loved it.

This is about as good as beet salad gets. After roasting the beets in the oven (organic beets--super sweet) and mixing them with the vinaigrette I decided that the spinach was unnecessary and enjoyed them as is. What a delicious dish!

WHAT A NICE CHANGE!! I was looking for a beet salad recipe that didn't have cheese in it. This recipe was a nice change from the common beet salads with feta or goat. I used 3 different types of beets - red, golden, and striped. My husband doesn't particularly even like beets but I was determined to find a beet salad he liked. He enjoyed this one and didn't miss a "beet."

I made this salad as part of a Valentine's dinner I cooked for my husband. We both loved it! I used baby spinach leaves and the beets on top were the perfect touch (though it wasn't easy to peel them.) The vinagrette had just the right blend of flavors.

Delicous! I used 6 medium beets (about 2 inches in diameter) because they came in bunches with 3 beets each. After peeling the very warm beets, I cut them into 8 wedges each, put them in a bowl, added the thinly sliced onions and baby spinach, poured on all of the dressing, and covered the bowl with foil. I wanted the spinach to be slightly wilted. After serving the plates, I topped them with some roasted pine nuts I had on hand.

This unassuming recipe had the most fantastic combination of flavors. It was an unexpected pleasure. I peeled and sliced the beets before roasting them, which took about 20 minutes off the roasting time.

This salad is not only beautiful to look at but a wonderful change from ho-hum spinach salads. Dressing has just the right amount of tang. Would serve at a dinner to some of my more adventurous friends!
