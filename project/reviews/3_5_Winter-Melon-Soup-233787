I lived with a Chinese family, Winter Melon soup was much simpler, Chicken broth, cubed tofu, cubed winter melon, and chicken gizzards that were cut cross hatched, and when they cooked opened up like a flower...much simpler, and more authentic.

Yummy! It did not take as long to cook the melon, and I was not sure if I should use the same ham for the broth as for the soup...i did not but i might next time.

i've made this recipe three times using my own stock and it's supremely delicious and elegant first course. i agree dried scallops are an essential, classic chinese ingredient. it has a deep flavor you can't get from the fresh. the only thing is that they're $40+/lb, so say $8 worth for this recipe. the ham gives a lovely contrasting taste too.

This is a lovely recipe, a lot simpler to prepare than the traditional one, where all of the ingredients are steamed inside of a whole wintermelon. On the scallops, please use dried and not fresh scallops - it makes a world of difference. Just soak the scallops overnight or when you are preparing the broth in warm cooked water. Do not boil it per recipe - that is bound to make it hard and stringy. That is not how you soften dried scallops. And you should resuse the water that was used to soak the scallops in per the recipe.

For A Cook from Buffalo: Winter Melon can be found at Asian grocery stores. I'm guessing you could find a listing online for somewhere near you.
