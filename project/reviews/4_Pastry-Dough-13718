Excellent! It even rolls out when made gluten-free (and that's saying something!) My new favorite pie crust recipe

It would be nice to know how long to cook it!

I love this simple crust recipe. Enough butter for flavor/texture - a bit of shortening to make the dough easier to work with. Don't overprocess and follow the chilling guidelines and you'll have a tasty, and easy to manage crust.

Decent pie crust recipe. It's not my favourite, but will do in a pinch.

I've never been able to successfully make crust until this recipe. It's a keeper.
