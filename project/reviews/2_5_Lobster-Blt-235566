I used this as an idea. I spread wasabi aoli on toasts and stacked broiled lobster, tomato, bacon and filed greens dressed with wasabi sauce. It was a great appetizer!

I tend to be a purist when it comes to lobster, but I had occasion to have enough leftover lobster meat to make this recipe. I used a crusty roll and all the other ingredients as specified. While it was tasty enough and quite a mouthful, I think the lobster salad was overpowered by the combination of the other sandwich ingredients. If I was to do this again, I'd make the lobster salad adding a bit more of the aioli and serve it on some mixed greens.
