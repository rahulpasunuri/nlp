I didn't try this recipe but I can tell by looking at it, that it needs a little work. Check out my Dulce de Leche Flan recipe at http://neverblandrecipes.blogspot.com/2012/02/dulce-de-leche-flan.html It's simple and fast to prepare. I takes 1 hour to bake and 4 hours to set though.

Is there a flan recipe that uses a large pan instead of ramekins? I'd like to make it for a crowd.

Just wanted to point out that the recipe given here differs from the recipe in the book. For example, the book calls for 2 quarts of milk to 4 cups of sugar, while this recipe call for 1 quart of milk to 4 cups of sugar. This recipe also calls for an extra egg yolk. The extra sugar might be preventing the flans from setting and changing the texture.

No forks! This recipe took a ridiculously long time to prepare- from the condensed (could have come from a can, and not taken 3.5 hours to reduce) to the extra 40 minutes of baking which produced the "set edges" and "wobbly center". The end result, after a delicious dinner of tamales, arepas, and poblano rice, this flan was a major disappointment. With my entire family looking on as I ran my paring knife around a slightly crisped edge, and over-turned the dish... out glopped something not recognizable as a pudding, much less flan. And there at the bottom of the dish, to top it off, my carefully prepared caramel, petrified to the point that the dishes had to be thrown away.

My grandmother who is from Puerto Rico has a great recipe for flan that's passed down thru years. It has 5 whole eggs, can of condensed milk and one of evaporated milk, 1/2 cup of sugar, tsp of vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Mix all together and strain thru a strainer into a caramelized pan. Put in a bath at 350F 1 hour. After 30 min or so check to make sure not getting to brown on top if so cover losely w/foil. This recipe on the website is a faulty flan recipe.

I had the same issue as others....this flan will NOT set up! So far, today, I cooked the milk for 5 hours to reduce it. It never got thick, nor very brown. Now, it has been in the oven for almost 2 hours and is soup! This WAS going to be dessert for Easter Brunch...now I have no dessert. Very disappointing!

I will not rate this because I didn't make it, but just looking at it, the flan could be missing an ingredient. Perhaps if you add 1 1/2 cups of whole milk to the dulce de leche and eggs, the final product will be delicious. As written, the texture is more likely that of candy than flan.

Dulce de leche is a caramel-like spreadable topping, made from various kinds of milk and sugar, for toast or desserts from Latin countries. In Columbia they use goat's milk and call it Cajeta where as in Cuba they use cow's milk. In the Caribbean they add vinegar which curdles the milk and gives the dulce de leche a drier, more crumbly texture and so less spreadable and used as more of a filling.

This is a very strange flan recipe. It is more like part flan and part dulce de leche, which is a very sweet brown milk syrup. Which is loved by Argentines.

With all due respect, I would like to disagree with all three of the first reviewers. My family comes from Spain, where flan is rich and creamy and respected as a great dessert. The addition of dulce de leche makes it supperb. If you want to impress anyone who knows good cuisine, then by all means make them one of these and they will enjoy it.

When I first saw this title I was very excited, then I read the reviews. For Mother's Day I made this as well as a traditional flan (because of the other reviews). It never setup, was much too rich and sweet, and all of my guests preferred the traditional flan. It also took me forever to reduce the milk and sugar down to 'dulce de leche'. Components of this recipe (the milk caramel) I may try again for other purposes, but certainly not the flan.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer on the fact that this thing never remotely resembled a flan texture at all. However the Dulce de leche taste was great, definitely not just a sugar taste. I would give the "Flan" part of the recipe one fork since it isn't one, but gave it three forks because it was such a great topping for ice cream, strawberries, and angel food. Oh, and scrap the bottom part about making the caramel altogether...just a hard sticky mess.

I grew up on flan. This was not flan. Firstly it wouldn't set. Secondly, once it finally did, it had the consistency of thick mud and tasted of nothing but sugar. I will stick to more traditional flan recipes in the future.
