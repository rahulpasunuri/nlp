This was ok -- but the timings and heat levels seemed way off to me. I might make it again but if I do will ignore the cooking instructions. Way too hot and way too long.

I picked up a ton of awesome apricots at the farmers market and was looking for a lamb recipe to spotlight them. This one looked good and had some flavors that I know go well together. The apricot relish recipe is very similar to a fresh mango salsa recipe that I'm fond of. I might experiment with adding some cilantro and trying to turn it that direction. As it is, the relish does taste like relish. and we found the flavor just didn't go very well with the lamb. I'd also definitely recommend omitting the brown sugar if your apricots are ripe. The molasses taste didn't mesh well. The grilling instructions for the lamb itself are spot-on.

I make this recipe over and over again during the summer months. The key is making the apricot relish the day before to let all of the flavors come together. It also goes really well pairing both with a yogurt-cucumber sauce.

Absolutely fabulous! Did not use orange juice in relish as I don't care for it and had a lime on hand. We loved it, as unfortunately did our dog(the theif). Fresh herb rub was nice change from usual marinade.
