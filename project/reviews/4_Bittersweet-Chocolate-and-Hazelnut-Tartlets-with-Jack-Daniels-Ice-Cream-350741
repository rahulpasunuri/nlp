This recipe is WRONG, at least for the ice cream. Note that the first paragraph of the ice cream directions is the same as the one for the sauce. Plus, there is no corn syrup in the ingredients list for ice cream. I've made this several times from the printed recipe and can tell you it is the most delicious ice cream. I've sadly lost my printed version and had hoped to find the recipe here. The contact link is broken. Does anyone know any other way to get in touch with Epicurious to let them know? Thanks!

I think this recipe's directions are slightly off, no real mention of how to make the custard, and the caramel takes WAY more than 7 minutes to boil to get the nice amber color. Yummy for sure, but allow enough time!

Outstanding, but I've gotten lazy in my advancing years. There's no need to scrape vanilla beans anymore when I can add a Tablespoon of Nielsen-Massey vanilla bean paste instead.

I made this for X'mas Eve. It was totally awesome!!! Each element would stand on it's own, but if I had to choose one it would be the sauce. I will definitely make this again and again!
