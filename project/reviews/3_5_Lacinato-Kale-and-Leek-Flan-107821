I have made this recipe many times since I discovered it in 2003. It has always turned out wonderful for me. The only changes I made was the use of whole milk instead of cream and I've used good Parmesan instead of the Pecorino when it was all that I had. I also think that the straining of the kale is important.

After reading the reviews, I decided to skip the straining step because I did not want to lose the yummy kale. To do this I added more egg (I halved the recipe so I added 2 eggs and 1 yolk). I also added a little more water to the kale when pureeing to make sure it was smoother. Just know that this flan will not come out as creamy as if you strain the kale mixture but it was delicious.

Using flowering kale, I followed this recipe to a t. The recipe doesn't specify how much liquid to press from the puree. I pressed out all of the liquid; too much because the flan never set. Even serving it still in the ramakins was a soupy mess. Leek has a great onion-like aroma and kale, such a distinct flavor when eaten raw but I felt like these ingredients were wasted in this recipe. The thing tasted like creamy broth.

Like others, I found the straining part of this recipe insane. So I didn't do it - I just blended as instructed and combined the ingredients. It was still delightful, although I would recommend adding at least another egg and/or egg yolk to help set the dish. Also, don't forget to salt to taste.

Very nice recipe and not difficult. It had a nice flavor and a pretty presentation when unmolded as it resolved itself into green and white layers.

I was looking forward to trying this "4 fork" recipe, as I love kale, leeks, and a flan texture however... this was the worst recipe I've tried from this site! I too ended up straining through a chinois which helped tremendously, after spending quite a bit of time and effort tediously pressing through a sieve. The end result was a creamy texture, but a not-so-great flavor. Much too labor-intensive for a bland end product.

a wonderful recipe that I've made many times. It's alittle time consuming, but worth the effort.

Our new favorite kale recipe.

Utterly delicious! I pureed it in the food processor, then put it through the chinois for a luxuriously velvety texture. I served it still in the ramekins, topped with some chanterelle slices sauteed in butter. This is a show stopper.

I thought this was very tasty and not too difficult at all - an immersion blender makes it much easier

This is a superb, flawless recipe which produces a spectacular touch of class to an elegant meal. We had it with roast duck and wild rice pilaf. The only pain is having to strain the mixture through a sieve.

We made this as part of the menu in Gourmet with the pork loin with mordatella and rosemary roasted potatoes. This took time and oour only mistake was taking them out of the oven too soon. We cooked only 30 minutes and some of the flans were not set all the way. but the ones that were looked just like the picture. as hints you need to chop the kale pretty small to cook to tender enough for the blender in only 8 minutes and it was still hard to puree in my blender. More water woudl have made it easier to puree and to force the puree through the sieve. This is where I had a problem. Perhaps my old blender is not powerful enough to puree smooth or my sieve holes were too fine. In any case I did not get as much puree out as I should have and filled only 6 ramikins instead of 8. The flavor was wonderful though and since this was the first time I tried to make a flan, I was pretty happy with the results. Do try this one for company.
