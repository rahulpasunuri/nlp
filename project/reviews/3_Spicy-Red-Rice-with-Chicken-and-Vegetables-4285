It was very tasty, but the rice turned out to be pasty.

Tasty and easy! Used brown basamati rice and skinless boneless chicken breasts; added fresh chopped jalapenos at the beginning for extra kick. Left out the peas and added Italian parsley near the end for colour and flavour. Lots of leftovers and reheats well.

I made this as written and divided it into 2 dishes - 1 for dinner, the other for the freezer. It's really nothing special but we thought of adding some shrimp next time to make it sort of a paella. I think it's a good base for starting something. Jambalaya? Paella?

Nothing special at all. There are much better red rice recipes out there. Try the Classic Red Rice recipe also on this site for a much sparkier and more complex flavor.

This recipe is yummy, but it does need more salt. I prefer using Braggs Amino Acids for that purpose, since it adds moisture as well, which was a good thing. However, more than salt, what it really needed was some SUGAR - or some facimile thereof (such as agave syrup, etc.) I added maybe just about a tablespoon of white sugar, and that helped a LOT. I also used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce because that's all I had, and was glad for the sweetness that added.

I would make this dish again..but I think I will tone down the cayenne pepper; I found that one teaspoon creates too much heat, overwhelming the other flavors in this dish.

Very nice and easy. We topped it with grated cheddar and a blob of sour cream. Next time I will add corn and maybe some red beans.

This is not a fancy dish, but it is quick and easy. I, too, prefer the green pidgeon peas, and it does need some salt. The teaspoon of cayenne might be border-line for some, so rather than cranking up the heat while cooking, I make sure there is a bottle of hot sauce on the table. Red Tabasco works well with this recipe.

Very easy to make, and used common kitchen ingredients. Just spicy enough, and the variety of veggies made it interesting.

I've made this recipe a few times. It is a great base, but needs some help. I substitute Green Pigeon Peas for the frozen peas and add saffron, chili powder and liquid hot sauce made from cayenne. It definitely needs more salt as well. After some doctoring it is tasty!

I love this dish! Easy, great tasting left-over dish and filling. I add saffron and lots of cayenne pepper....I have made it many times, and will continue to do so.

i made this dish and it was NOT good. the finished product reminded me of my college budget dinners. i ended up adding chunks of zucchini & when that didn't help enuf I added cooked shrimp & kielbasa & called it jambalaya.

I enjoy spicy foods so I made this dish using the whole teaspoon of cayenne pepper and did not find it spicy at all. In fact I would describe this recipe as written to be very boring and bland. I would not bother making this dish again.

I made it yesterday and added some tobasco (in fact, my picky boyfriend did)and we really liked it. It turned out resonably spicy,and I am sure I will make it again.

I really liked this dish; however my husband wasn't as crazy about it (he doesn't tend to like rice). I used 3/4 tsp. cayenne and thought it a little spicy. Next time I'll use 1/2 tsp. I'll definately make this again.

Loved this recipe because it was quick and easy, and finally came out with a dish spicy enough to make my husband happy! (I used the whole 1 teaspoon of cayenne.) I only used half of the garlic though, and thought it was fine.

I've made this a few times now, and I like it better every time. It's even better then next day, once the spices have had some time to really soak in.

I really liked this dish, and it was quick and easy. I used dry, powdered cayenne pepper (about 3/4 of a teaspoon). I might use a little less cayenne pepper next time.

I made this on a lark for my boyfriend and he loved it!!! We add a bit more 'kick' to the recipe by adding fresh hot peppers.

I wasn't sure what the recipe had in mind for the cayenne pepper, but I used one large fresh chopped cayenne pepper. I used homemade chicken broth instead of canned. This recipe is delicious!

the only real problem I have with this recipe is that it states add "3/4 to 1 Cayenne Pepper" Well, is this teaspoons, Tablespoons or what? I would like to know this before I start making the recipe. Thanks
