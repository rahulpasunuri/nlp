i had some trouble getting the large cookies to taste the way i thought they were supposed to. i ended up putting the one inch cookie holes in the oven. i baked those up and sandwiched a small dollop of the marmalade between them and with powdered sugar sprinkled on top those flew right out of the kitchen! baked in batches of 20. pair with ice cream. yumm.
