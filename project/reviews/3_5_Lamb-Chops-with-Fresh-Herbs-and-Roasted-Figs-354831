ok - quick disclaimer here...i only made the figs. that said, WOW. i've been looking for a quick and easy way to savor the plethora of figs that come from my father's tree, aside from eating them fresh or making them into jam, and this is it. i think that they would accompany pork tenderloin very nicely, and i can't wait to have them for dinner tonight on grilled baguette with melted telemi or tallegio or goat cheese or, or, or...

I have a fig tree with tons of figs. I made the recipe with chicken and orange and figs and it was wonderful. The herbs in this recipe were overpowering. The figs could hardly be tasted. I would never make this again. The flavors did not go together.

What do you do with the other half of herbs?

The Poker Guys all thumbs up on this. you gotta be careful not to ruin the chops by overcooking them. Very delicate and astounding on the table. The carnivores here ate all but the bones and they were gnawed on heavily!!

I didn't think this was all that good. The lamb was just okay (I think garlic is "too much" for the delicate flavor of a young rack of lamb) and the figs came out mushy (like overcooked eggplant). I might try the figs again but use my outdoor grill for high searing heat rather than essentially baking them like in this recipe.

Lovely recipe I'll make again for a special occasion. I quartered the amount of meat, to make it healthier for "dunch" with a close friend, so I did the same with the fresh herbs -- a mistake. The meat would have benefited from having more spicing to work into the rack before roasting. I also took an earlier reviewer's suggestion of searing the lamb in oil flavored with shitakes, and that added a delicious layer of flavor. (We enjoyed the chewy mushrooms as a garnish.) I served this with Spaghetti and Braised Kale from this site and a Niagra-region Merlot I picked up on a recent trip to Toronto. All elements meshed beautifully!

This is very easy yet elegant recipe. As others noted, the figs stole the show. We used chops and made it all in a cast iron skillet - fewer dishes!

I made this for my mother's birthday dinner, and it was a real hit! The lamb came out perfectly, but the figs were the star of the show. The herbs complemented them beautifully, and the juices left behind on the baking sheet were like jam; I wanted to lick it clean! This recipe is so simple and highlights these fresh ingredients so perfectly, I wouldn't change a thing. It is a fine example of honoring simple, fresh, seasonal ingredients. Please do your lamb and figs justice and leave the recipe as is!

This is a great dish. The grapeseed oil has a VERY mild/almost nonexistant flavor that it adds to the lamb. I used white truffle oil to add a more robust flavor and it tasted great. If you dont want to buy the truffle oil (it's more expensive) sauteeing shitike or portabella mushrooms in extra virgin oil then adding the lamb produces a similar taste.

Made this dish last night, and it turned out really well. A few notes: -I don't know why the recipe says to use grapeseed oil to pan sear the rack. Grapeseed oil has no flavor and is for high temperature cooking. I used olive oil and it worked just fine. -I put the rack in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 minutes for rare. 20 mins at 425 deg might over cook the ribs. I would use a probe if you're not sure. -I made a fig gastrique that I thought made the dish complete. i didn't have shallot so I minced two garlic cloves. I didn't want to oen a bottle of port so I used creme de cassis. Fig Gastrique 1/3 cup cider vinegar 1/4 cup sugar 1/6 cup port 1 small shallot, minced 1/2 sprig of rosemary 4 figs, small diced Heat sugar in a heavy bottomed saucepan until it dissolves and turns golden brown. Carefully pour in vinegar and port. It will bubble and hiss, take caution and keep your face away from the pot. Add shallot, fig, rosemary, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Reduce until syrupy and break up the fruit with a spoon or spatula.
