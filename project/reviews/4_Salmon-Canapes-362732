I made these for a cocktail party and people loved them. It was a nice change for an old favorite. Crostini after crostini gets a bit heavy. I made a few adjustments; I sliced the daikon a little thinner because it was huge, and a little tough for the 1/4 inch slice. Also, because I love them with salmon and i wanted to add a little more interest, I added two capers each. People were very pleased.

Though there have been suggestions of substituting the daikon, all of my guests raved about the daikon (and the dish as a whole). The goat cheese spread is so simple to make and really delicious. This is a keeper for future parties.

Served these on New Year's Eve - big hit. Daikon is a nice substitute for more crackers and bread which are plentiful in appetizers.

I made this on thin pumpernicel squares and I think it turned out better than with the daikon, but everyone liked them.
