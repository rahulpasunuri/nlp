It would be very obvious of me to say there are a lot better soup recipes out there. However, I might be hard pressed to produce a more satisfying soup with such a simple list of ingredients...along with the fact that it's an absolute breeze to make!

I found this soup lacking and too watery so made the following changes and now we make it regularly; serve with a salad and baguette. I add a generous tsp of cumin, 1/4 tsp ground coriander. After I blend the soup, I add a second can of rinsed chick peas and blend it less, so that it is chunky in consistency. If too thick, you can always add water. I use a hand held blender, and find it is easier, safer and less clean up. To serve, top with sour cream (low fat)and chopped fresh coriander.

I started making this soup years ago and have never grown tired of it. It's healthy and very tasty. I always add lots of extra coriander and make the pita triangles with garam masala. Just one thing: beware of hot liquids shooting out of the blender. Make sure everything is secure before you start the blender or OUCH!

Not terribly exciting, but I did like the crouton recipe and use them in salads.
