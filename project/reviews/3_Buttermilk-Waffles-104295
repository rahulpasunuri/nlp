Had to substitute milk & lemon juice for buttermilk. The waffles turned out very light with a nice texture. Added vanilla for a little more flavor.

This recipe was too dry to use as is. Three eggs and six tablespoons of butter are not enough to cover all of the dry ingredients. To create a batter, I added skim milk. However, because of the lumps that that warm melted butter and cold milk created, I had to use a hand blender to smooth it out. I added fresh orange peel to this recipe, and I'm glad that I did, since without this addition, the waffles would have been bland. I wouldn't make this recipe again as it appears here; the alterations that I made to the recipe, however, created a wonderful waffle that my family and I enjoyed. THAT I will make again.

This recipe is fantastic for easy prep...we make the mix the night before, the week before, and it is delicious. We add a bit of vanilla, and occasionally a chopped apple with cinnamon.

It is one of the better recipes I tried. I used real buttermilk and added vanilla, as suggested by many reviewers. We would like it more if we could make this recipe lighter,fluffier and possible crispier on the outside.

As per other reviewer, I substituted the dry buttermilk powder for REAl buttermilk. Why not? They were good. Not the best I've ever had, but good. I think I might add vanilla extract next time, too.

Very good waffles. Even better if you use 25% whole wheat flour. The best thing about this recipe is its make-ahead ability. I'm not always at the top of my game early on weekend mornings, but I love a good breakfast. This recipe allows me to make delicious waffles for me and my family with almost no effort. It's (these waffles) have become a weekend tradition at my house. PS: Try scattering dried cranberries on the preheated waffle iron immediately before adding batter.

I made these with fresh buttermilk, by substituting equal parts buttermilk for the water and omitting the powdered buttermilk. I also added a little vanilla extract. They were delicious.

I made these for a Mother's Day brunch with the recipe for cinnamon syrup in the Double Cinnamon French Toast and the Caramelized Bacon (all Epicurious). Everything was so yummy we stuffed ourselves and couldn't get up from the table for an hour. I am glad that there are a few waffles left over, though. I am sure they'll be just as good popped in the toaster straight from the freezer.

I thought these were delicious! They used ingredients I already had in my cabinets and didn't require preparation ahead of time. (My other waffle recipe has to rise overnight.) Based on the reviews before mine, I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 2 tsp vanilla for a little flavor. They were fantastic! I froze the leftovers to make in the toaster.

Yum!! These waffles were delicious! Adding vanilla gives them a little more taste, but they were awesome!

They were just okay. I think they need more flavor. I added vanilla extract maybe I will add more next time. However my kids really enjoyed them the first day. They didn't reheat well. I would make again simply because I don't have another waffle recipe

These waffles turned out very well for us...nice and tender. We also experimented with sprinkling cinnamon over the batter after spooning it on the waffle iron. Another variation we tried was to chop fruit into tiny pieces and combine it with the batter before spooning it on the waffle iron. Freezing the fruit first made it easier to chop evenly. This was pretty good but we may try using a little less water next time if we use fruit. We can imagine lots of variations for this recipe. I too, liked the convenience of preparing the dry ingredients ahead of time.

These were great and very easy to make...I like the do-ahead-ness of the recipe and it certainly beats, both is price and taste, "convenience" waffles (either powder or already made) available in grocery stores...of course, the pure maple syrup didn't hurt either :-)
