To the "cook from NY" - I think the point of this site is to mix with other foodies. maybe the recipe isn't "epicurean" but the conversation certainly is. Plus I think as we take this good 'ole recipe and modify it to our tastes, we change & elevate it (eggplant? wine? thanks for the ideas!).

Two years ago, I would not have considered this recipe as I can be as snooty as NY :). In today's economy, after a bad day......added frozen veggies, stewed tomatoes, and topped with cheddar. YUN!

Very good basic recipe. I drained the ground beef before reassembling, added spinach and topped with parmasean cheese.

For the Cook in Columbus, I found this on the internet: "Johnny Marzetti is a casserole created in the 1920s by the owner of the Marzetti Restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. Who was Johnny Marzetti? According to the "American Century Cookbook" by Jean Anderson, Johnny Marzetti was the brother of the owner of the Marzetti Restaurant." My friend's mom makes this dish with a pound of bacon instead of ground beef, and calls it "Baltimore Mac".

You think you had it bad... my mom's version, aptly called "Mom's Concoction", included the addition of a can of Campbell's Pork and Beans! Believe it or not, it really was one of our favorite dinners as a kid. I guess my italian mom was trying for a chili of sorts? Drain the beans, toss the pork fat square, and add to meat mixture 3-4 min before adding the noodles. Also included a clove of minced garlic with the onions. Never used Italian dressing mix, just salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, and basil to taste. As an adult, I'd rate this closer to 2 than 3 forks.

This is an easy, week-night dinner that is sure to please. It reminds me of a home-made hamburger-helper meal. But I was surprised how tasty it was. Be sure to spice it up with your own seasonings, and add cheese!

Just wanted to say "thank you" to everyone for reminding me about "American Chop Suey," a favorite dish from my childhood in Massachusetts. It was one of my first-generation American mom's first forays into "American" food, and my brother and I loved it. Almost 30 years later, my mom's a gourmet cook, but I'll bet someday my kids will love this as much as we did.

This reminds me of the only mac-n-cheese my father would eat "in a crunch"... only this doesn't have the cheese! (he was a HUGE food snob after enduring 20 years of "lean meat" years with ground beef at $.50 a pound) Seriously... the best macaroni is a box of pasta, a can of petite diced tomatoes, 1 lb. sauteed ground beef (with whatever spices you see fit, whether it is Mexican/Italian/Greek inspired), and about 16 ounces shredded cheddar cheese!

Who hasn't had this?? Here in the Northeast we call it American Chop Suey. My mother would make it when I was little and use whatever she had on hand. If she didn't have canned tomatoes or tomato sauce, she'd use ketchup (and it was good)! I add any leftover vegetables I happen to have...corn, celery, peppers. Leave out the Italian Seasoning and add a couple tablespoons of real maple syrup! The secret to making it really great is to bake it as a casserole for half an hour after you mix all the ingredients. And don't forget to add cheese!

This is better if you brown a couple of chopped bacon pieces before you brown the meat and add 1/4 cup of catsup

My sister and I called this recipe "Glop" when we were young, but we loved it and gobbled it up every time Mom made it. It needs to have cheese, though. I grated some sharp cheddar over the top, and my four-year-old ate two helpings of it.

THANK YOU THANK YOU! This was actually one of my favorite recipes my mom made when I was a child. She passed away very young so I never knew how she made what she called "Ghoulash". She added velveeta cheese at the end and boy was it yummy. It looks like it will run in the family my 13 month old son loved it also. Thank you!

I liked this. I undercooked the macarone a bit and let the whole thing simmer much longer--30-35 mins. My kids liked it as did my husband with the big appetite--makes plenty for a family of 4.

my mom used to make a version of this using corn and stewed tomatoes - my father affectionately called it instant indigestion!

This is a great week night recipe/comfort food! In Kansas this was goulash (which is probably why it took me so long to make the hungarian dish), but my husband insists that this is jamizetta. The name never made sense till I saw people calling this johnny marzetti. Now, this is in no way gourmet food, but it's not bad quickie food. Give it a shot!

This was a favorite pot-luck supper dish when I was growing up just south of Boston in East Weymouth, Mass. We called it American Chop Suey!

New York probably doesn't like bologna either. I looked up this recipe despite not really needing it (and I don't think anyone else did, either) but just to see if anyone had an interesting take on an all-time favorite. The ground beef is thawing as I type, to make it this evening. YUM! three cheers for comfort food!

Great fun and thanks for the memories. This was a staple in our home in post - depression Newark, N.J. Too bad the reviewer from N.Y.C. missed the point and waxed huffy-puffity.

I cook this recipe when my spouse is busy in the world of volunteerism and does'nt have time or the inclination to plan and execute a menu for several days. As there is only the two of us and I make a batch of it there is always leftovers for the next day or freeze for whenever. I do put extra garlic and Italian spices in it with a touch of Louisiana Hot Sauce to give it a little bite. As a leftover, after it has marinated in its sauce it is even better.

I can't beleive I found this recipe here...I just got off the phone with my mom asking her to remind me how to make it. This was one of my favorites growing up, and still is a comfort food as an adult. I even asked my mom to make it for me while visiting for my birthday! Although, I did think it was something she had concocked all on her own, it's nice to see other people enjoy it too.

In Missouri we called in Goulash and in the era before pizza delivery it was the easiest meal to prepare from staples always on hand - ground beef,home canned tomato juice, elbow macaroni, salt and pepper. To this day as much as I love exotic ingredients and recipes this is wonderful comfort food. The entire family enjoys it and when my kids go to college I'm sure it is a "recipe" they will carry with them. Sometimes it's the simple things prepared with love that are the best and most remembered. I've noticed they do call it Johnny Marzetti in Ohio-anyone know the story?

I can't believe people are actually "rating" this so-called "recipe." This is the type of stuff served in school cafeterias across the country. It is in reaction to this sort of fat-laden and uninspired food, consisting of highly processed (often bland) and canned ingredients (that many, including myself, grew up on) that magazines such as Bon Appétit exist. This is not to say that once in a while these sorts of dishes aren't enjoyed and welcomed, but, I thought, this was a site were we could turn to go beyond dishes prepared with Campbell's cream of chicken soup and sliced American cheese.

This is a good, basic recipe that's fun to play with. For example, inspired by the other reviewers and what was in my fridge, I added white wine, garlic, mushrooms and lemon zest. I also substituted pennette (the pasta shape on sale that week) for macaroni which made it look a little more unusual, and sprinkled it w/ parmesan. Turned out great!

Growing up in New England we called this dish American Chop Suey. It was never prepared with green peppers, just lots of tomatoes and onions. We sure ate a lot of this as kids, but it always warmed my stomach and made me feel happy. Still does to this day! Soooo good!

Good, simple, hearty, homestyle food. I did add some garlic powder and a can of Rotel diced Italian-style tomatoes. I also followed the advise of another reviewer and placed the mixture into a cassarole dish, topped with plenty of grated Mozzerella & sprinkled with Grated Parmesan, then baked at 350 until the cheese was browned and gooey. Yum!

We all enjoyed this, but I did add 2 garlic cloves, half a chopped eggplant and a good splosh of wine!

I love this recipe. Sometimes I make it in the morning, put all in a 9 x 13 pan and top it off with grated mozzerella cheese. Then at dinner time I just put in the oven at 350. Ricotta cheese can also be added.

I did a search for Johnnie Marzetti and came up empty then did a search for pasta and ground beef and got this. I guess it is an Ohio thing to call it marzetti.

We called this Johnnie Marzetti and my Mom made it with a quart of homecanned stewed tomatoes, garlic, celery or green peppers [whatever was available] and, of course, the onions. It was made on top of the stove and during the last few minutes cubes of yellow cheddar cheese were added. The pot was always "licked clean." My kids grew up on it. Great!

I ate alot of this dish, when I was young. I found it very filling, and very easy to make.

This was a common school cafeteria lunch special with celery replacing the green peppers! We all liked it. But it really does taste better with a can of chopped tomatoes and some garlic added, not to mention any kind of cheese besides American. But it brings back nice memories of childhood! I can't believe the author of this receipe ate pig's feet! I used to watch my dad do that!! Yuk!!

This sounds an awful lot like something my 2nd mom used to make - she called it "goulash". It is considerably improved by some cheddar cheese - either before it goes in the oven or once it's served.

Oh come on people! Maybe I have simple tastes but this was an all time classic standby when I was growing up, great when you really want to fill up when you're starved. It's just your basic macaroni casserole, but try a can of crushed or chopped tomatoes (instead of sauce_, some garlic, onions (I usually omit the greenpeppers) fresh parsley and then bake in the oven with a layer of cheese (any cheese really) and a sprinkle of bread crumbs. Yum!

I can't believe someone else's mother made this! My mother used celery instead of green pepper, but the results are similar. Talk about bland!! As dull as it may be, I must admit it I make it occasionally with the addition of 4-5 cloves garlic. If you bake it long enough the noodles form a sort of crust that for some reason appeals to my husband. He's not fond of the underlying layers, but enjoys the crunchy top. Give it a whirl - it may not be as bad as you remember
