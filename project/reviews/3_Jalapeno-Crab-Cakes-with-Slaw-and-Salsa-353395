These were quick and easy to make and the eggs helped the crabcakes stay together during frying. Made our own coleslaw and dressing and were good to go with a little salsa and sour cream, perfect for Friday night date night, even after 38 years of marriage!

Very easy. We served it with a peach salsa and it was good.

I think this recipe is so easy, and satisfying, that it deserves three forks. Granted -I've never made crab cakes until tonight. I took into consideration that they were described as bland in previous critiques. So I added some sazon (it's what my mother would do) and paired it with a garlic-y succotash. And I'm content.

These were very bland. Extra salsa and sour cream were the only saving grace. Skip this one and try the Shrimp Cakes with Chili-Lime Cream Sauce instead. Although clearly not as healthy, much more enjoyable.

why someone would want ruin perfectly good crab meat with 1 cup of filler and 4 eggs is beyond me

Loved these! The crab with Panko makes them quite sweet, but the lime balances it out nicely.

The crab cakes were okay...a little bland without the sour cream and salsa toppings, but low in fat. Could use more seasoning.
