I'll be preparing this for a dinner party on Sunday and am looking forward to it. This will be the 2nd time that I've prepared it. I substituted asparagus for the snap peas but other than that made as directed. It's a beautiful presentation and delicious as well. I paired it with the basil caesar salad and the lemony potato salad located in the top rated salad section of this website. The dinner had an upscale picnic feel to it. I think I may do the same again and add the lemon curd ice cream cake (again on this website) as the dessert. Love Epicurious!

This is lovely. I did the veggies by 1.5 times, and that really wasn't needed, and was harder to cook. OK, do it as written, but feel free to improvise - a cook does the recipe as writen, a chef makes changes that seem good.

Love this recipe! This has become my go to for a healthy dinner party....definitely make extra of the pistou. I agree with other reviews to add lemon juice and garlic. I also add a dash of sesame oil to the pistuo which I think really brings out the nutty flavor. I serve it with cous cous and an unoaked chard...I have slow roasted the salmon, broiled, and pan cooked and think that pan method came out best. Enjoy!

Fantastic! Was looking for an unusual salmon recipe, and found it. Not difficult to make. Here's a tip: find the shelled pistachios! Other reviews were correct: add extra garlic and lemon juice. Made a nice difference. Never would have thought these flavors would have meshed, but they really did. If you don't like this one, you're nutz!

Only 4 forks available, but we would give this 5 forks! Excellent with Chardonnay. Healthy on a plate! Easy to make and oh so delicious!

I don't understand why people change the recipe. I want a review of the one posted - not tweeks! If you don't like it, rate it first and then post your changes. Sorry if I appear grumpy.

This was a huge hit! I did add more garlic, (as I just love garlic) and I served it with a side of quinoa. It was absolutely fabulous. Will definitely be making this again and again. So simple and HEALTHY!

I loved the flavour and crunchy texture of the pistou!

Very easy and very good! No complicated ingredients or steps. It was delicious and tasted very fresh. I did add a bit of lemon juice to the pistou as well as squirted a dash on the salmon too. Served with a small jasmine rice, and it was a hit!

This was fabulous! I was somewhat skeptical after tasting each component on its own, but wow, all they work together to make a very tasty dish.

I also added a bit of lemon zest and lemon juice and used 2 chopped garlic cloves. And used a food processor to make the pistou which was very tasty. My wild caught salmon cooked beautifully in the suggested 3 minutes per side. I served it with rice, optional. Very easy fresh tasting recipe.

This was a fabulous meal for a hot, humid summer night! I got a beautiful (and pricey!) piece of wild king salmon and to do it justice wanted a treatment that would complement and not disguise its flavor. This was just what we needed! I added garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a grating of lemon zest to the pistou and highly recommend doing that. We used red bell pepper because we had it on hand. We grilled the salmon. I plan to make more of the pistou and use it to stuff chicken breasts along with a little Havarti cheese.

Wow! Terrific all around. I've now made this twice, the first time as is, the second time with an extra portion of the vegetables (cooked separately, identical in everything but the fish) for a vegetarian who joined us for dinner. All raved, especially my vegan friend.

Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom! This is so delightful. Used a bit more garlic than was, strictly speaking, called for (4 cloves, instead of 1), but otherwise prepared as instructed. Had slightly thicker than average salmon fillets, so cooking time was a bit longer for them. Paired with the herbed jasmine rice recipe also on the site (heavy on dill). Fantastic! Will definitely become a regular meal.

I really liked this dish - very sophisticated flavors. I used the veggies per the recipe - they are two of our favorites anyways. As for the Pistou - I goofed and threw everything into the Cuisinart. It made a sort of pesto which turned out pretty fabulous. The pistou definitely needs a bit of salt to pull out the flavors, but is otherwise a very unique way to serve salmon.

I've made this several times. I've always left out the green onions (not a fan), and also just use more snap peas in place of bell peppers (also not a fan), thick shredded carrots are a nice sub. I prefer the taste of the pistou when it's been cooked a bit, so I typically add almost all of it to the pan when I'm cooking the salmon, and then just have a little bit for garnish when I plate it. I also sometimes make a half batch of pistou, and toss with veggies as a side dish with other meals.

DELISH! Just received the "seriously this is the best thing you've ever made" response from my wife. I made everything exactly as directed except only bought 1/2 pound of snap peas. I made a tomato and lentil salad on the side but we didn't need it -- the vegetables make this a complete dish. In addition to being delicious, the presentation is gorgeous. Definitely worth the splurge on the yellow and orange bell pepper as some of the reviews mentioned.

This was great. I couldn't find fresh dill, so 4 stars because I used dried. Fresh dill would make it exceptional...my fault. I added a couple of dashed of sesame oil to the pistachios to make it a little nuttier. Served with bacon wrapped and roasted french green beans, mashed potatoes and a couple of fried shrimp (for garnish). Will make again.

First taste test of this at the earlier "kids" dinnertime and I understood why they scraped off the heavily-dill-flavored pistou and just ate the fish. Later, when my husband and I had our meal, which sat in the warming drawer for more than an hour, it wasn't so potent. The nuttiness of the pistachios came through nicely. While it is something I won't make again as written, I may try it with a different herb instead of dill.

Wow huge hit at our house even with the kids! The Pistou made this recipe and as another person stated it was hard to not eat it straight out of the bowl. I doubled it luckily! And bare in mind I dont really eat fish at all I never have liked it I originally made this as a surprise for my husband. Next thing I know Im grabbing a second serving it was even good cold (it was lunch the next day). I will be making this again and it will probably be a regular at our house. We loved it!!

Simple, easy and great recipe. Had a party with 18 people, so I roasted the salmon in the oven and made sure not to overcook it. It was popular even with those who generally don't like salmon. Will definitely be making this one again.

This is a keeper. We'd had it twice and it is a favorite.

I made this for a weeknight dinner and my husband and I loved it! In fact, I had to keep him from eating the pistou right out of the bowl. At $2.50 each (ouch), the yellow and orange bell peppers that I purchased were a splurge, but combined with the green sugar snap peas and the fleshy pinkness of the salmon, it was a beautiful medley of color. I was planning on serving with rice but completely forgot, which wasn't a problem given that the vegetables were very filling. Just devoured it along with a simple vinaigrette salad. This recipe is extremely simple to put together and yet looks and tastes 4-star. Definitely going in my list of favorites!

The flavor and presentation are fabulous. The hardest part of this recipe is having the ingredients on hand. I baked the salmon and prepared the vegetables while the salmon was cooking to speed things up which worked great. I made the following adjustments: 1) I don't like dill when it's too intense, so I reduced the dill to 2 scant tablespoons 2) Reduced the green onions to 1/4 cup 3) Increased the peppers and used red, yellow, and orange; next time, I will slice them in 1/4 inch widths 4) Added a little more garlic 5) used salted pistachios and adjusted the salt accordingly. The recipe can be halved easily.

Excellent recipe! Easy to make, nice blend of flavors. A new favorite for salmon.

YUM! We grilled the salmon on cedar planks and served with garlic, cheesy mashed potatos instead of peppers. The pistou was the best part of the whole meal!

This was really yummy. Used coriander, instead of dill, because that's what we had in the house, shallots instead of green onions. had to add a little water to the pistou to get it to combine properly in the blender. the colors of the pistou, snap peas, peppers and salmon were really pretty. definitely a keeper.

I was slightly disappointed with this, but that might be my fault, not the recipe's. I think that I toasted my pistachios too long and didn't chop anything fine enough. But the main problem was that it was too oily. That said, the combination of flavors was surprisingly good. I would make this again, but that will be my last attempt.

I've made this several times now and the first couple of times I was trying to figure out how people were saying this was an easy weeknight meal (lots of finely chopped, etc.). Not sure it's proper, but I used a food processor on the pistou and ta-dah, an easy weeknight meal. So much tastier too...Might be common sense to some, but to others, it takes a little while to get there. =)

This recipe is really special--so many wonderful flavors. My husband and I made this together and scarfed it down with some lightly salted brown rice (which really complemented the pistachios well). This is one that I will make frequently, and I hardly ever repeat recipes. Love, love, love!

we love this recipe! sometimes we make it with almonds instead of pistachios. still delicious.

I made this recipe for my husband's bday since salmon is his favorite. He told me hands down that this was one the most delicious dishes I have made. It was easy and healthy. The longest part of this recipe was de-shelling the pistachios....otherwise, the mix of flavors was absolutely perfect and the mix of colors made for a gorgeous presentations. I highly recommend this.

Easy enough for weekday meal, impressive enough for company. I've made this over and over. Usually use pine nuts since they are always on hand. Last night I used asparagus instead of peppers and liked even better!

super easy, very fresh taste, delicious and heart healty. what more could you ask for?

I give this recipe 4 forks mainly because of the taste to time and health ratio. It is delicious. Maybe not 4 forks declicious but when you figure how healthy and easy it is, it gets another fork. The pistachio flavor and texture works wondefully with the crisp sweetness of the vegetables and the fish. I made the recipe with plain old olive oil, not pistachio oil, which I imagine would be overwhelming. Everything was pretty much perfect.

Attractive presentation, great flavor and easy to prepare. I've prepped everything in advance and grill the salmon outdoors at the last minute. Guests raved...and so simple. I increase pepper in pesto and add a red pepper for more contrast.

Nice dish, looks fantastic! I skipped the snap peas and just used yellow and red bell peppers. The pistou is very good, but needed a little oomph so I added one clove minced garlic. My salmon took a long time but that was my fault (too thick, should have gone with a thinner cut), and I did NOT turn in the pan. I used a cast- iron skillet and after searing the skin-side for 3 minutes I put the whole thing in oven under the broiler to cook the top part. Came out great. Did have to re-heat the veggies a little.

This is a very nice dish, easy to make, colorful, with good presentation and certainly tasty. I added fresh basil in addition to dill to make it real Pistou.

A decent meal but I felt it needed something to perk it up. If I make it again I'll add some crushed red pepper and/or some pepperoncinis.

I used almonds because I had them on hand--I think pistachios or pine nuts would be better. I loved that the pistou was not oily like a pesto. I used one orange and one yellow pepper, the colors made a beautiful spring presentation. I saved time (not money) but getting bagged stringless peas. This was delicious and a great way to get vegetables in!
