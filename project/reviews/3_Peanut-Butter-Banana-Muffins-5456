This is a family favourite now. I make these muffins regularly and they always please. I never have wheat germ in the pantry, so I just use whole wheat flour to substitute both the white flour and wheat germ. It works very well. I find whole wheat has so much more flavour than white flour anyway. Try it!

I really enjoyed these and so did my son. I added a banana and increased the peanut butter using natural/creamy and everything else "as is". GREAT healthy snack or breakfast - very filling. Will make again!

This was an okay recipe. I made some of the changes suggested by other reviewers - upped the quantity of banana and peanut butter, and added chocolate chips. They are okay, and I'm sure they'll be better when cooler, but I find myself thinking that the heavy, satisfying flavour and texture of peanut butter just isn't made to go with muffins. I would just make plain banana and choc-chip next time.

My boyfriend just said these "melt in your mouth," so that's a good sign, right? I skipped the wheat germ, used 4 bananas and a little extra peanut butter (I even used creamy natural and it worked fine). I also didn't have any muffin cups on hand so just buttered and floured my pan - good news, muffins popped right out! Light and fluffy, not too sweet, overall I'd call these one tasty breakfast treat.

I would give this 4 stars with a few changes. I used 3/4 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat instead of 1 3/4 cup all purpose, 1 egg instead of two, olive oil instead of vegetable, 5 small ripe bananas (did not measure), 1/3 cup honey instead of 1/2, 2 TBS dark brown sugar instead of 1/4 cup, flax meal instead of wheat germ, 1 cup of all natural crunchy peanut butter instead of 1/2, added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of all spice. It was AMAZING!!!! I make muffins atleast two times a week for quick breakfast snacks that my husband and kids can grab. The changes I made were based on making a healther muffin and using what I had. I may even reduce the honey and sugar next time around, as they were plenty sweet. They are super moist and you might even be able to use yogurt instead of oil. However, I like using olive oil for the Omega factor.

These were good but not great. I agree with the reviewer who said "you can only eat so much banana bread." I also made these to use up the new Natural Jif peanut butter, which is too runny. Anyway, I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ, and left out the brown sugar and vanilla. They are nice and moist, but needed some texture (had I used chunky PB).

These muffins are pretty tasty, but with the addition of semi-sweet chocolate chips they are fantastic!!

I am making this recipe with whole wheat pastry flour and I'm very pleased with the lightness and texture. For the many who feel there isn't enough peanut flavor, using a peanut oil instead of another vegetable oil (such as canola) intensified the peanut flavor. Bananas must be over-ripe (90% black and ugly is the best). I've actually eliminated the brown sugar completely, using only the honey and have gotten excellent results. I do use an immersion blender to blend all the wet ingredients until very thick and frothy and pour over dry. I add a peanut crumb crunch topping (oats, chopped peanuts, maple syrup, salt, dash cinnamon, flour & butter. It adds textural contrast and you can make your topping as sweet as you like if unhappy with the sweetness of the muffin).

These were fantastic! I mash, measure into 2-cup ziplocs, and freeze over-ripe bananas for use in recipes later, and so I doubled the recipe...I also added a "splash" of milk (which may have made them less "dry" based on others' reviews). I added a package of milk chocolate chips (what doesn't taste better with chocolate?!). As a result, I had to physically restrain my 9 and 6 year-old boys for fear they would explode - they each ate 4 muffins and were going for 5ths! yum.

I am surprised that so many didn't like this. I used the suggested 4 bananas, but took 1 full cup peanut butter, 1 egg, 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/4 honey and added 1 tablespoon allspice. They are delicious, with a fantastic consistency, and not at all sweet.

How to make this recipe excellent: Replace the wheat germ with ground flaxseed, use 4 bananas instead of three, use one large egg instead of two, and 1/3 cup of plain yogurt instead of the oil. Then drizzle toasted sesame oil to taste into batter. To make this a fluffy muffin, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to the dry ingredients. For extra umpf to the flavor, add a 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I baked this recipe above in cast iron molds sprayed with canola oil for six beautiful cakes. They turned out amazing!

Banana and peanut butter - how could these not be good...but this is just not the best muffin. Usually, the banana flavour of muffins gets better a day or two later and they stay nice and moist but these weren't like that at all - more dry and heavy, and tasted neither distinctly like banana or peanut butter. Not bad, but there are better muffin recipes out there. Perhaps the most important test of all, my dear boyfriend only ate one (he's never eaten only one of anything in his life!)

Rating: 2
The overall result was just okay. Didn't expect too much from reading other reviews. Tasted good right out of the oven but as soon as it cooled down, it became a little too dry and not very banana-ey. I don't think I would make this again unless I absolutely craved a healthy banana peanut butter snack.

YUCK. These muffins are easy to make and bake up perfectly, but unfortunately they don't really taste like anything. Even my PB-and-banana-loving kids weren't interested, after the first bite. Disappointing.

Rating: 3
Very good muffins. The resulting muffins are lighter in texture and flavor than you might think. I didn't find either flavor overpowering, and enjoyed the muffins very much as a breakfast item. If I wanted to make them more decadent, I'd probably add 1 cup of chocolate or peanut butter chips to the mix next time.

I have made these twice. The first time I used three large bananas and it tasted more like banana bread, the second time less so. I used cinnamon apple sauce in place of the oil and oats instead of the wheat germ. Both worked great. My whole family adores these and they are gone very quickly! Will make again.

Rating: 3
We always end up with overripe bananas, and I'm just plain tired of banana bread. This is a great recipe to use up the bananas, and my five-year-old, who is a PBJ purist, loved them. We added applesauce (helped with the moistness). With the wheat germ and honey, I can tell myself these are a healthful breakfast option. The five-year-old suggested renaming these "Peanut-Butter-Banana-Dream Muffins."

Easy, healthy muffin recipe that my kids loved. I didn't have wheat germ, so I substituted ground flax seed. I also added an extra banana for more flavor and moistness. They came out perfect.

This recipe turned out OK, but I would choose to either make banana nut muffins or peanut butter cookies instead.

yummy, but the peanut butter really overwhelmed any banana flavor there might be in these muffins. my husband really liked them, but I would prefer a more banana-y muffin.

For someone who loves peanut butter I was really not impressed with this recipe. Too bland and dry. I'll stick to regular peanut butter banana sandwiches from now on. Won't make this one again.

I thought these were so great and a nice change of pace from your typical muffin recipe. You could really tast the peanut butter. I accidentally burned mine a little on the bottoms, and I still ate all of them. I like the fact too that they are relatively healthy and the pb packs some protein as well. I am almost seven months pregnant and I'm craving these for breakfast tomorrow!

I used egg beaters, and baked for 15 minutes instead. They are dense, but not too much and I really like the peanut and banana combo. added some choc. chips to a few too.

I have made these several times now and think they are perfect just the way they are. This recipe is one of my all-time favorites!

Here are the personal adjustments I made to the muffins: less peanut butter, more banana, no wheat germ, more oats, less oil, less sugar and honey, egg white only and (the kicker) a couple of dollops of no-fat sour cream. The came out superb, really moist and no doubt with fewer calories. Adding more banana and reducing the honey and sugar gave these muffins a perfect not- too-sweet taste. I will definetly make these again!

I was really disappointed with these muffins. Although they had a nice, light texture, they were quite bland. I would like to try them again using more banana.

Just wonderful! I have been wanting to make something just like this for my toddler, and the wheat germ and peanut butter sure pack a nutritious wallop. Like many others, I also substitued applesauce for the oil. Delicious! Thanks, Debbie Rudy, for a great recipe - from a fellow born-and raised Westerviller.

I followed this recipe almost exactly... I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil. They were wonderful! I was looking for a muffin that my 2 yr old could eat as an a.m. snack and this is it! If making mini muffins, watch them carefully... they tend to burn even when cap isn't browned. Another hit from Epicurious!

Not bad, had a cake like texture. Used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, instead of pure white flour. A tad bit too sweet for me though, will cut out the brown sugar and use egg whites when making this again.

Very good but the cooking time was a bit long for my oven and they got dried out on the bottom. My family ate them up anyway, though. Easy and yummy.

I just made these using 1 1/4 c white flour 1/2 c. whole wheat, 1/2 applesauce instead of the oil, and upped the bananas a bit, used a mini muffin tin and they were very good. They are not for those who are looking for a really sweet muffin though(I did do one batch with mini ch. chips and it made them more dessert-like). My two year old really liked them and I like that they are a healthy snack.

I made these vegan by using brown rice syrup in place of the honey, and 2 T flax seeds, ground and blended with 1/2 cup water until frothy, in place of the eggs. I also added 1 t cider vinegar and they rose beautifully. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup ww pastry flour in place of the flour + wheat germ, to increase the fiber. As others suggested, I also increased the bananas and decreased the oil to 1/4 cup. Excellent muffins!

Made this on a whim with smooth peanut butter and applesauce instead of oil...delicious! My husband loved them (and he doesn't usually eat peanut butter or bananas), as did mine and his coworkers. These will definitely get made again and again!

Looks from the reviews like everyone needs to tweak this recipe a bit -- but it's worth experimenting with. I found the original recipe quite dense and sweet, so I decreased both the peanut butter and the honey to 1/3 of a cup. Increased the banana to 1 1/2 cups, and also substituted applesauce for half the fat with no problem. The final product was light, moist, and tasty.

prepared as directed. yum!

I was concerned about the reviews stating that the muffins were dry and bland but decided to make them anyway. (I wanted to try something new with my overripe bananas.) They turned out great! I increased oil from 1/3 cup to almost 1/2 cup because I only had natural peanut butter which makes things a little drier as well. Other than that, I followed the recipe. They're light, moist, and very tasty!

These are decent muffins and very easy to make, but they definitely need something to perk them up. I substituted ground oats for the wheat germ and added 3/4 cup chocolate chips. They turned out good, but I still think there are more interesting ways to use up overripe bananas.

We love these muffins. I make them so frequently because of the healthy ingredients and not a lot of sugar; and I never use refined sugar, either organic which is minimally refined or Sucanat, which is cane juice. I do not know what others may have done wrong, but I always use natural peanut butter and somethines even whole wheat flour and they come out perfect every time!

Cannot adequately convey how absolutely mediocre and boring these were. I'm a peanut butter fanatic and I threw away the entire batch (including those my daughters took ONE bite out of). Surprised this recipe ever made it into Bon Appetit...

These were terrible! I made them to take to a conference and I don't even want to take them. They are so dry you practically choke eating them. I used all the recipe ingredients and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I will either take nothing or whip up something else. NOT a keeper.

Unlike other reviewers, I was unimpressed with these, as was my family. I made them twice, once with Laura Scudder's crunchy and once with Jif's smooth peanut butter. L.S.'s was too dry and the other was a bit dry and too heavy tasting, and, well, just not too appetizing for a breakfast. treat.

These were great! Instead of the wheat germ I replaced it with ground oatmeal that I made in my (clean) spice grinder. I also used more banana than the recipe called for. My son loves chocolate and I added some chocolate chips to half the batter, and needless to say that portion of the muffins is gone. I live in Colorado and didn't even need to make any adjustments for high altitude. Made them for my family last night and they are almost gone!!

I really liked this recipe, but I made a few adjustments due to a lack of ingredients in the house. I used wheat flour in place of wheat germ, creamy peanut butter and a handful of chopped pecans in place of the chunky peanut butter, and light brown sugar in place of dark. I also skipped the muffin papers and just oiled the tins well, and used the texas size muffin tins instead of conventional size so I yielded 9 muffins instead of 12. Despite the adjustments, the muffins came out great. Yum.

it`s an easy recipe but i think that its better with more bananas and less peanut butter...and a creamy one because the flavor is a little too strong.
