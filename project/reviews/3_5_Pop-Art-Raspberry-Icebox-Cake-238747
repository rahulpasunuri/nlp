Playful and Pretty. I followed another reviewer & used Cassis which really intensified the fruit flavor. Unless you cut really large slices, this will generously serve 8 people.

Very pretty and very easy to make, but did not taste great. The raspberry flavor did not come across as strong as I hoped. Maybe a raspberry or chocolate sauce would have elevated it.

A huge success. As a lifelong fan of the Icebox cake on the Famous Chocolate wafer pkg, I was very pleased with how easy and beautiful this turned out. Actually easier to make than the original recipe as the wafers are just slipped into place. Skipped the liquor, used a melted Hershey bar just to adhere the outer cookies to the plastic wrap (didn't feel like buying a large amount of bittersweet just for this) and snuck in a few more cookies into the interior. I brought this to a potluck and everyone was wowed.

I hated the way this finished off...Couldn't cut thru the chocolate covered cookies and couldn't get it out of the pan, with that said, I made sandwiches with the extra mousse and cookies and those were devine!!! Worth the recipe just for that!

Fabulous and foolproof. Took only about 15 minutes from my day. I did not have the liqueur, nor did i bother with the melted chocolate. This was a hit with everyone... i am making it for another dinner party this week!

Really easy and lovely. I couldn't find the Nabisco wafers either but used Goya Maria cookies in the chocolate/coco flavor, which, depending on where you live might be in the Latino/ethnic food aisle in your market or the regular cookie aisle. One pack is sufficient but be warned, they are crumbly. A separate note: I pre-prepped the 9 cookies, froze them on a tray, decorated them with melted white chocolate, froze them alone, & then assembled the cake.

Super easy to make - Needs about 8 hours to freeze all the way through. I added blueberries - pureed some and kept others whole. Delicious and looks fabulous!

I made this dessert gluten free by making GF chocolate wafer cookies. It was a huge hit for a birthday party! Super easy, beautiful, and perfect way to highlight fresh, local raspberries. I made the GF wafer cookies 2 days prior, then made the dessert 24 hours before I served it. Great recipe!

I amde this as a test for a summer dinner party - I was bringing the dessert. Not sure what went wrong but myself and family of testers did not like it. The texture was grainy. I used the mixed berries per other reviews. Ended up throwing it out before freezer burn set in.

This was super easy to make, and was a huge hit...gone is seconds. I will be making it again for Easter.

Definitely easier than it looks. My Safeway keeps the cookies and ice cream in the same aisle, so it wasn't too hard to find the chocolate wafers. I couldn't find raspberry liqeur, though, but it seems to taste ok without. I also skipped dunking the top cookies in chocolate.

This was a fairly simple dessert that can be make in the morning and frozen, then used for your dinnerparty in the evening. I however cound not find the chocolate waffers so I used famous Amos chocolate cookies which are larger and I did not need 27 as the recipie called for. Very delicious dessert.

For the WOW factor this is great. Used my dad's homemade blackberry cordial. We can buy the wafer cookies here in Boothbay Harbor ME, usually in the cookie aisle. This is a big hit.

Great!!! So quick and easy! I love things you can make ahead of time for entertaining, that way I don't have to be in the kitchen the whole time. I love the idea of ginersnaps and mango. btw, the wafers were in the baking isle between chocolate and marshmallows at my grocery store.

Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafer Cookies are NOT available anywhere!!! What good is the recipe???

Rating: 0
the Nabisco chocolate wafers seem to be "hidden" by some supermarkets.... if you can't find them in the cookie aisle, look where the store has ice cream toppings and things like ice cream cones ( not the frozen kind).. for some reason, this is where some stores display these wafers

Super easy and great for bringing to a bbq. Out of 5 cakes and pies brought to a party, this was the only one finished! I substituted creme de cassis for the framboise, and the flavor was lovely. I think I'll try this again with mixed berries. Word to the wise: don't skimp on your plastic wrap or you will regret it.

I made this last night with terrific results. Substituted Kirsch for framboise, and mixed berries for raspberries. It's super delicious, super easy, and super fun to make.

We used to make the no-raspberry version when I was younger and it was always so fun and good. When I saw the idea of adding raspberries, I couldn't wait to try it! It turned out really great. And it really didn't take that long......

Very easy, fun and good. My husband does not eat desserts but he saved this one to eat on his own!

I made this to take to the ladies dessert we were having while the boys went to the game. My eldest watched sceptically until the end when he got a taste and decided he wanted to skip the game! It only took 30 minutes to put together and was simple. I did strain the seeds out of the berries which may have made it a little soupier and thus less final volume,

Has anyone tried or thought to try Girl Scout thin mints? They are basically the chocolate wafer covered in mint flavored chocolate? They freeze well I've heard, so I'd like to try this recipe with them next yr when they come around again. Thanks

California Gold Cook is a lazy cook. This couldn't be much easier to make!

A great do ahead desert, simple to put together, and no fuss to serve. Next time we will try something with mango and gingersnaps.

This is one of the easiest desserts ever. Made it for a family function and everyone raved! I was so happy with it that I bought the cookbook it came from. Presentation was great too. You could easily substitute other berries and it would be just as good. I agree with letting it warm up just a tad for added creaminess. Everyone should try this one this summer!!

A simple, do-ahead summer winner! You could add a raspberry coulis to further dress it up. To California Gold, there are 4 ingredient cookbooks for simple recipes - please don't rate a recipe without trying it - not helpful..or fair!

great recipe - didn't bother with dipping the cookies in chocolate, but otherwise followed the recipe - put in the deep freeze and was ready to go in 3 hrs - everyone loved it

Tonette7: you can find the chocolate wafers on the top shelf in the cookie aisle (I have no idea why, but they're almost always on the very top shelf). Will make a big difference for you vs. using Oreos, they are thiner and have a MUCH better texture!!! Cheers!!! :o)

you can find the wafers at Safeway by the cookies and crackers!!!!!!!!!!!!

Has anybody found the chocolate wafers?! I have made 3 of these so far. Used regular Nilla wafers the first two times, last night I made it using Oreo cookies ( i scraped out the cream centers). Not that difficult to make. It was nice and light, especially on a hot night in the South! This is a keeper.

Wow factor: Out the roof. From initial unmolding to the cutting that reveals the vertical stripes, it got rave reviews on the visuals. Plus, it tasted wonderful. The liquor added a nice intense flavor. One hint: letting the slices warm up makes the texture much more creamier and pleasing

I made this for a bbq and it went over really well. One change I made was that I couldn't find chocolate wafers, I could only find chocolate mint and they were great. The hint of mint added to the raspberry and chocolate flavoring. I also had some melted chocolate left over and I coated the loaf pan with it meaning that when the cake was turned upside down and taken out of the loaf pan there was a coating of frozen chocolate on it. It didn't look as pretty as the picture but it sure tasted yummy.

Wow - thanks for the excellent review California Gold Country! I always appreciate when people rate a recipe without ever actually making it. It's why I use this site! Keep up the good work!

Skip all the hoopla with the raspberry step and just use pure whipped cream with vanilla added and light sugar or splenda. Saves one step. And no risk of 'deflating' the whipped cream.
