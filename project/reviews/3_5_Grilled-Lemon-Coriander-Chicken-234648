This came out great. I made it with a really big roaster and cooked it for about an hour but it was moist and delicious and everyone loved it. Definitely will make again.

I made this last night and despite reading the recipe, I didn't realize I had a 7.5 pound chicken. Anyway, there was plenty of stuff to stick under the skin and I had enough to put on the inside as well. I cooked it for a little more than an hour. My dh put a pan of water in the grill as well and the chicken came out really moist, flavorful and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Delicious results and a very flexible recipe. The heat can be adjusted easily by subbing another pepper for the serrano. I used a pasilla chile. I cooked the chicken in a dutch oven with the chicken sitting on a layer of smashed baby red potatoes and carrots. I covered for half the time, uncovered at the end to brown the skin. This could easily be prepped earlier to make an easy dinner: just stick it in the oven and you're done. The chicken and veqetables were very flavorful and tender. The leftover chicken makes good sandwiches or base for a chicken salad. A good recipe for family dinner.

Made it (almost) exactly as instructed--I added an extra serrano 'cause I like stuff HOT. Delicious, familiar and kind of Mexican tasting. We served with warmed corn tortillas and salsa.

I just made this as written and it was very good. However, even though it was not too hot, I feel that the flavors of the rub get overwhelmed by the serrano. Next time I will use less of the chili, and probably tweak the herbs. But overall very good.

I thought this was a good recipe although I did change the cooking method. I roasted my chicken in the oven and basted it with the juices every 25 minutes. I also added the puree to the outside of the chicken in addition to under the skin. It came out crispy, tender, and juicy. I love the puree mixture and thought about using it with grilled flank steak.

This is great. Flavorful, moist, crispy, delicious. We make it often and it gets rave reviews.

Grilled chicken was tender, moist, and golden brown. However the flavor was bland, shallow, and uninspired. Keep looking, there are much better recipes out there.

Fellow chefs, I'm afraid that "A Cook from Newbury" must eat her (my) words. After reading the reviews, I decided to try this recipe again, this time even with a free-range chicken. I confess - I had actually not followed the instructions exactly the first time. But when I did, it was wonderful and the cilantro flavors came through loud & clear. So ... highly recommended.

I followed this recipe to a T and found that it's a great way to cook a chicken but that the cilantro flavor gets lost in the grilling. Of all the many ways to eat chicken, this wouldn't be our first choice.

Delicious. Made exactly as called for except rubbed extra herb mixture on the outside of the chicken also. Took a little longer to grill than the recipe stated but well worth the wait.

This is my summer chicken recipe of all time. I've always wanted to know how to perfectly roast a chicken on the grill. You can use anything (herbs are best), as long as there is the oil, for the stuffing. And I imagine you can use any chicken but a fresh (I use D'Artagnan) chicken is best. We'll be making this all summer, with poussin, cornish hen,and whatever else comes our way.

Very good flavor. I butterflied the chicken before grilling to decrease the cooking time and it came out very moist. The leftovers made good sandwiches and would also be nice in quesadillas!

WOW! Fired up the grill for lamb chops / vegetables and added this to have something cooked for the week. Did not have cilantro and the grill was ready so I used italian parsley. This is spicy and great with parsley - imagine with cilantro. Needed extra time on the grill but I cook with wood not gas. Great poultry dish that makes incredible chicken sandwiches. Easy to do and uses items in the pantry. Enjoy!
