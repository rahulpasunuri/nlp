This was a bit of a disappointment. In fact, this is the first negative review I have submitted. The lima beans were too much, and I love lima beans. I just didn't love lima beans in risotto. Frankly, I'd just as soon make this without them. It would be a respectable, simple risotto.

This was the first risotto recipe I ever made and though I now have many others that I enjoy, I keep coming back to this one. My husband loves it as is, but to make it heartier I sometimes make it with italian sausage (out of the casing). I fry the sausage in the pan then remove it and reserve it. I then fry the onions in the same pan... proceeding as directing and adding back the sausage late in the stirring process. It isn't much extra work and makes it a stand alone meal.

this recipe was basically bland. while the risotto base was good, i think it needs something less bland than lima beans. i tried adding pancetta per earlier suggestion, which did help a little, but it still needed something. texture was wonderful though

Nice risotto recipe. I added diced prosciutto at the end. It really helped this recipe to POP!

Be sure to toast the rice til it's browned before adding the wine. Otherwise you'll wind up making risotto soup. I used white grape juice instead of wine for this, and the flavors of the juice and fresh rosemary were beautiful together. So round! My sweet husband said, "This is the best risotto I've ever put in my mouth." How's THAT for a review!
