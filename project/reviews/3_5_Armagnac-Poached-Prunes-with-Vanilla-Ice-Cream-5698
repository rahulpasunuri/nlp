Excellent! I had this at the old Laurel in SD many years ago and am so glad I can make it in my own kitchen. Everyone loved it.

This is a great end to an Italian, French, or Spanish meal. Easy to do - little prep, can be made in advance, and it tastes GREAT!

Subbed ruby port for the Armagnac in an attempt to duplicate the delicious prugne at Caffe Mingo in Portland, OR. Also, served with mascarpone cheese instead of vanilla ice cream. Earned rave reviews.

ok. I just don't get all the cheers for this dish. I am sorry, but you really have to like tthe flavor of prunes to enjoy this dish. It was simple to make, and I do like to eat prunes on occassion, but this dish did not do it for me. the flavor of prunes was overpowering.

I can't begin to tell you how much I loved this sauce! When you think of making a dessert for a special occasion, you want it to be delicious, easy to prepare, impressive to guests and to be able to make it in advance. This recipe scores 100% in all areas. This Christmas I am making it to hand out (along with Cranberry Sauce with Port and Dried Figs, also from this site) as gifts. Hopefully, that will get me off Santa's naughty list.

The main ingredient might turn people off from trying this recipe, and what a shame that would be. We, too, first had this at Laurel Restaurant in San Diego (at the urging of the bar tender) and it was fabulous. Such an easy dessert - impressive for company, too.

This recipe proves that the bad press prunes get is unfair. This is gorgeous - sensual, boozy, and rich. As another reviewer's pointed out, this is also great with a dash of deep, dark chocolate - something that prunes and their eau de vie have a natural affinity for.

I had this at Laurel, and I can't remember what the rest of the meal consisted of. However, one hint: I asked for chocolate ice cream with it, and it added a really good added touch of intensity to the dessert.

Prunes! Can you imagine? But wait intil you try this recipe. It is one of the best desserts I have ever had.When I visited San Diego I went to Laurels and experienied this dessert straight from their kitchen. I am hapy to report the receipe is just as good.
