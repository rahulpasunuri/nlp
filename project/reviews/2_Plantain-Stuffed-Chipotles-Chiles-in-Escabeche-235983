My husband and I enjoyed the overall flavor and inventiveness of this recipe, but it lacked a certain spiciness. Also, the vinegar flavor from the escabeche was overwhelming, particularly the next day after marinating for 18 hours. The flavors from the marjoram and bay came out strongly and beautifully. Reserve a few hours to put this all together- multiple steps, not hard, just time consuming. I would cut down on the vinegar in the escabeche if you're set on making this.

If you click the "print shopping list" button at the bottom of the recipe, you will see that they have you buy: 24 large chiles moritas (dried bright red chipotle chiles, preferably soft; 3 oz). I'm sure that these come dried in plastic bags at the latino markets.

The recipe says it serves 6 so I would assume 6 large chilies?

I would love to make this, but can someone please update the Ingredients list in the recipe to include how many chiles you're supposed to use??

I don't see chiles in the ingredients list.
