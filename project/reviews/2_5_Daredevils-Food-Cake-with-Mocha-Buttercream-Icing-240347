I turned to this icing recipe after I had totally ruined a more involved butter cream one. I cut the sugar to 3 cups and used a whole stick of butter and probably 3 tbl of coffee. It made enough to ice a 2 layer cake and everyone raved about it. It was still sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Plus it was sooo much easier than the initial butter cream recipe I attempted. I will definitely use this again.

I WISH I had read the last review before I used the buttercream recipe -- horrible! Super sweet and a weak, pocky texture. Just say no!

2 stars for the icing. Ick. Way, way too sweet. Even the kids say too sweet. It tastes like you are licking the powdered sugar right out of the bag. I am disappointed!

Rating is for the buttercream icing only. It's quite good, but like other reviewers said -- too much sugar! I made it with half the sugar, and half the coffee, and a little Kahlua added. Fantastic! Coverage is a little skimpy for a 2-layer cake with removing all that sugar. I used it for a full angel food cake and would add a little more for a 2-layer.

I am a sugar junkie, and thus ignored the previous reviews. Foolish me. Trust me, people: this is TOO MUCH sugar, no matter how much you love the stuff.

Buttercream icing? More like sugar icing. Way to sweet, and I only used 4 cups of sugar. next time will add some milk and and extra stick of butter.

I made this exactly as written and in my opinion--it was dry. The frosting was the only redeeming quality (moisture-wise). Next time I will add 1 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup canola oil. Deliscious flavor though, and no leftovers at work.

The cake is decent. I found it to be slightly dry and crumbly which wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but still good. The icing recipe barely works. I added a bunch more butter and then some cream to get a passable icing - I would not make the icing again and would recommend using a different recipe all together.

The cake is not dry, but is crumbly. It doesn't have a tremendous chocolate taste. The buttercream is much too sweet and too thick, even after adding all the coffee. I wouldn't make it again.

I found the cake to be moist and quite delicious. Doubled the ingredients because I have a family that loves cake and one day later, one of the cakes is finished :- )

My brother and I decided that this cake would be great for my mother's birthday. However, we had to alter this recipe just a tad. The cake turned out amazingly fluffy. It felt like a pillow when it came out of the oven. However, the icing was a bit different. We were surprised at how much sugar it required therefore we made the recipe have 4 cups of sugar, rather than 6. In addition, we added 1/3 cup of milk to the icing to make it thick. There was an uneven amount of dry and wet ingredients. With those minimal alterations we came out with a beautiful and tasty cake. :)
