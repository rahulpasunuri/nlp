Ok, I admit I made some changes to this recipe. This is what real cooks do -- take a concept and RUN with it. This made a tasty... scrambled eggs. Also, UTTERLY DISGUSTING LOOKING. Maybe I just screwed it up, but all the juices from the cooking veggies made the eggs just fall apart. Not an omelet at all, just white scrambled eggs with veggies in it, and a pool of liquid on my plate when I was done. Gross-looking. But with a little basil and Aleppo pepper, very tasty when you close your eyes!
