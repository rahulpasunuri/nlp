I followed the recipe exactly and these came out wonderful. They were delicious and light. I will definitely make them again.

Great recipe, wish i had read the reviews first and added a little extra sugar and some almond extract - i used dried cranberries instead of cherries, since that's what i had - came out good. Would be nice with some lemon zest. These had a good texture - i keep my flour in the freezer, so I think that helps with keeping the butter cold!

The very first reviewer was right...if you handle the dough too much it will ruin the texture. These were good and great texture. Next time I will follow other reviewer suggestions and chop the cherries, possibly add more cherries, add toasted slivered almonds, and use almond extract instead of vanilla. I also think this is a good base recipe. I will try other variations and maybe the citrus glaze as suggested.

I would not make these again. I followed the recipe exactly, they looked great, but were too dry. My husband also thought they were kind of heavy, but maybe we just like lighter baked goods.

Excellent recipe! Based on the reviews I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, since I like my scones on the sweet side. I also used all-purpose flour. These came out light and delicate with a nice crust on the top. A real keeper.

Way too much baking powder. I thought it seemed odd and they taste pretty awful. I'm going back to my trusty recipe in The New Best Recipe. Far better!

Rating: 1
This was disappointing. Definitely would not make again. Too much baking powder flavor, too dry and not sweet enough. For great scones, try Zuni Cafe cookbook scones. The best. Why did I ever try another recipe? I had buttermilk to use up. MISTAKE.

This is my first attempt at making scones and I found the texture of these to be lovely. I wish that they were a little bit sweeter and I might chop my cherries next time. Maybe almonds would be a nice touch or a little bit of lemon zest in the batter. I'm going to make a lemon curd to pair with this - maybe this will round out the flavor.

Wow - these are absolutely outstanding and they're so easy to make. Light, buttery, flaky . . . and delicious. I'm not sure scones get any better than this. The only change I made was that I sprinkled with turbinado sugar rather than ordinary granulated sugar.

Love this recipe! Scones come out on the drier/crumbly side and less sweet which I prefer. For a variation I double the dried cherries(any variety), add 1 cup toasted sliced almonds, and 2 tsp almond extract. I'm going to try to vary the recipe with other fruits or perhaps shredded cheddar...

No offense to the cook from Los Gatos, CA, but why would you think soy milk instead of buttermilk would do anything except make the scone drier. Maybe consider posting with no rating.

Rating: 0
No offense to the cook from Dublin, but the reason to use cold butter rather than melted, is it helps to keep the scone light and flaky. As the cold butter melts in the baking process, it creates micro-layers.

Casting about for something to do with buttermilk left over from a cake I made last week, I came upon these scones. Mmmm! They were light, delicious and really easy--easier than making pancakes from a mix. I served them to my teenagers and their friends and there are no leftovers. I'll definitely make these again--I still have two cups of buttermilk in the fridge!

This turned out really well. Used regular all-purpose flour and more cherries than the recipe called for; also added a couple handfuls of bittersweet chocolate chunks. It seems like a good basic recipe that can easily incorporate different ingredients (currants, dried apricots, white chocolate, etc.).

These are yummy. Fruit is nice, but chocolate chips are better ... that's the way we roll!

I am an American living in Ireland (where scones are de rigeur) and I can assure these would qualify as the traditional Irish version. They're great. I have a tip for you though - if you want to make this recipe much faster and easier, melt the butter, then combine it with the other wet ingredients and mix the whole thing up until just barely blended. Drop it in spoonfuls on your baking sheet and gently press it into a flattened round. They come out looking fabulous and taste perfect. I suppose you could still roll it out and cut it into shape if you really want to - but in my opinion, it's six of one, half dozen of the other!

This may seem a strange suggestion (especially if, like me, you aren't very fond of white chocolate), but these are excellent with the addition on half a cup of white chocolate chips. It just seems to complete the recipe. Credit goes to a friend for thinking of this (even though he also doesn't like white chocolate).

Taste was very good but they were a bit drier than I like. Very pretty too.

I've made this many times, and most times it is delicious. I vary the fruit from fresh blueberries to dried cranberries or cherries and flours (last time it was 1 part quinoa, 1 part whole wheat to 2 parts white flour), but always add oranges. I add the zest of 1 orange to the liquid part, then use an orange glaze (1.5 cups powdered sugar and .5 cups orange juice). They are delicious! I once tried using this as a base and adding cocoa powder without no fruit, but they were really dry and cakey...

I made these with dried cranberries and topped them with an orange juice-powdered sugar glaze. Delicious!

Substituted soy milk for buttermilk (allergic) and used regular flour as other users suggested. Scones were dry & fairly tasteless. The only thing that saved the day was my batch of lemon curd, which I slathered generously on top.

Rating: 3
Excellent - tender with subtle crunch to the edges. Am just enjoying my first one fresh from the oven, & it benefits from your reviews, thanks. I added the zest of one orange, & used TJ's tart dried cherries. I used King Aurthur unbleached regular flour, & a generous sprinkle of turbinado sugar on top. They were baked on a stone. This is gently sweet - very nice. I may enjoy the orange juice & p.sugar drizzle on my next warm scone. Definitely will make this again.

Excellent - tender, yet with a nice crunch to the edges. Am enjoying my first one fresh from the oven now, and it benefits from previous reviews, thanks. I used TJ's tart dried cherries, and King Aurthor unbleached regular flour. I added the zest of one orange, and used turbinado sugar (generously) sprinkled on top. They were baked on a stone. This is gently sweet - very nice. I may use the orange juice & p.sugar drizzle to accentuate the second warm scone.

Great scone! I use unbleached flour instead of cake flour, and fresh blueberries instead of dried cherries. I also sprinkle big sugar crystals on top!

Rating: 3
I like this recipe as is and sprinkle the tops with sugar-in-the-raw which adds sweetness. The best change I've ever made however is to substitute dried raspberries (hard to find but one local market sells them) for the cherries and add 1/3 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts. Absolutely to die for.

Rating: 3
My husband and I both really liked these. Instead of the cherries, I added some chopped frozen cranberries, the zest of one orange and the juice of half the orange. Based on one reviewer's comment that they were too cakey, I used regular white, unbleached flour instead of cake flour. The texture was perfect. I would agree with other reviewers who said that they are not sweet enough. I mixed the juice of the other half of the orange with powdered sugar and made a light glaze that I drizzled on top of the scones. It was a perfect touch. Increased the sweetness just enough without making them too sweet.

I have made this recipe for my family and friends many times and everyone has loved it and asked for the recipe! It has become a breakfast/snack staple in our house. A friend requested chocolate scones so I added some cocoa powder to this recipe (leaving the cherries in) and it was a huge hit!

Rating: 3
Classic scone recipe, although a bit light on the sugar for me. These are also good with craisins, currants, in fact, perfect for launching any number of variations, like lemon peel and candied ginger. And to the cook from NY below who thought that the choc chip toffee scones tasted better, well, I bet they did, since they are made with 2 CUPS of heavy whipping cream! Yikes!

Rating: 1
I was not at all impressed with these. Maybe with a pound of butter slathered on them they would have been better. They tasted powdery. Considering what a pain the dough is to work with, they are justs not worth it. Try the chocolate chip-toffee scones from this web site. They are out of this world.

This was so easy and fast. An excellent brunch recipe and very easy to double for a large crowd. The scones are not too sweet. Serving some good strawberry jam on the side made a big hit.

I had never made scone before these. They were wonderful. I substituted half the flour with wheat flour and tripled the amount of cherries (so there was a guarantee of one in every bite) and got rave reviews from my husband and several co-workers. I will definately make these again!

Rating: 4
Made this twice and doubled it both times. It was well-appreciated by the guests who ate them. Both times I needed to add a little extra flour as it was too sticky. Once I cut the cherries in half so there would be more of them incorporated throughout the scones. I may add nuts next.

Excellent scones. My family is a bit of a "scone snob" and these were a big hit all around. Added bonus for me is that this is one of the simpler scone recipes I've come across. Definitely will make a gain.

This recipe was awesome. My husband love them, I loved them, my collegues at worked loved them. I made the recipe as is, except used 1/4 C packed brown sugared and applied quite generous amounts of sugar on top. Nice flaky, wonderful smell. Love the butter milk. Will definately make again. Sooooo easy to do

I have made these scones twice now. They got rave reviews from those who tried them. My husband really enjoyed them. I have never heard him comment so much about a scone. The batter is more than sticky & I found difficult to work with. You really have to use a bit of flour to not have it stick to your hands in order to form it. The second time I did chop the dried cherries & added more. I also added a bit more sugar. My husband preferred them the original way. I thought it was fine. They are not a very sweet scone so I thought the additions would help. Next time I will just do more fruit & leave the sugar as is.

Rating: 2
All in all, a disappointing recipe. The scones were too cake-like in texture, and the dough was sticky and difficult to handle. In addition, it's not clear why cake flour, an egg, and an entire tablespoon of baking powder would be necessary scone ingredients. It's easy to find a better scone recipe, so don't bother with this one.

I make these scones at least once a month. I take them to work and they disappear within seconds. I have substitued dried blue berries and cranberries - all of them are delicious. We have them for sunday morning - reading the paper - having coffee - on the patio!!

This is the most excellent scone recipe I have made. I double the recipe (16 scones) and substitute a 10 oz. package of cinnamon chips for the cherries. It is very important not to overbake (350 degrees is best). After baking, I wrap each scone in plastic wrap to prevent dryness.

Our new chef (Cheryl at the Fairville Inn, Chadds Ford, PA 19317) made this recipe for our guests. The recipe page, torn, worn, and well used was saved by Cheryl since 1990. The guests lucky enough to be there that day couldn't get enough of them.

I'm not a big dried sour cherry fan, but I think the rest of the recipe makes for a very decent scone. It is true that it comes out a tad dry...but all the more reason to slather on the clotted cream and jam!

I made this for Christmas brunch and I also made some Currant Scones from a recipe that I found in a newspaper. The Currant Scones were excellent, but the Buttermilk ones were a bit dry. I was careful not to over bake them.

As a true tea drinker, I love scones. Served in the English tradition with clotted cream and preserves. The use of dried cherrys is what caught my eye and made this recipe intriguing. Good idea!

Fabulous recipe, these scones just melt in your mouth. We like to add more cherries to give them a bit more texture and more intense cherry flavor.

I had never had scones before so I really didn't know what to expect, but I felt that the scones were very much like ordinary biscuits. They were not especially buttery tasting in spite of adding 2 extra tablespoons. They were not at all sweet in spite of the brown sugar. They were flaky and tender, which Is, I suppose, the main response I had. I thought they would have been good with whipped cream and strawberrys as a strawberry shortcake. I had to put apricot jam and margarine on them to make them taste as I thought they should and then they were very good. But I would have done that with any roll or biscuit.

This is the best scone recipe I've tried. I substituted 2 cups of regular flour for the cake flour, and almond extract in place of vanilla. They were tender, but be sure not to overwork the dough. I have made them several times, and have also used currants in place of the dried cherries.
