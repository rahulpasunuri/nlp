I failed with this cake. I somehow deflated my eggs (under-beating or bad folding) and the cakes didn't rise. I should have used the technique for a genoise cake by heating the eggs and sugar. Sift the nut and flour mixture to get rid of lumps. With 1 cup butter, I would mix the butter into a small amount of batter first and then fold into the rest. I finally made a different cake, poached peaches instead of pears for 3 mins, and made a white chocolate buttercream. The cranberry puree is amazing! I reduced the sugar to one cup and added a bit of lemon juice. Put it between the layers for great color! The flavors in the cake and puree are great, I just couldn't make it.

I made this for Christmas Dinner and it was a beautiful dessert. I followed the advise of others and made this dessert over a 3 day period. My frosting was a little thinner than I would have liked, and the cake itself was slightly drier than I wanted , but the flavors were amazing and I did brush the cake with Grand Marnier and add a little of the puree to the cake layer. I will make this again.

This was fantastic. It tasted delicious and it was a beautiful presentation. The only thing I did differently was that I upped the orange zest in both the cake and the frosting. Yum!

I made the entire cake including frosting. When I looked at the marinated pears, they looked a little "yuky" so I eliminated them and just attached the nuts and sprinkled dried cranberries on top along with more nuts. Looked great, tasted great and very moist.

I forgot to also say in my previous review that I did not use the bread crumbs in the batter, it just seemed unappetizing. I replaced with a couple extra tablespoons flour. I didn't want the texture of the cake getting too rough.

Tried this and ended up with a spectacular looking, dense, dry dessert on Christmas night. Flavour was only so-so. Rather disappointing because the rest of the meal (entirely Epicurious based) was *fabulous*. Don't let the directions intimidate you. It's not difficult. I guess it just wasn't meant for me.

The is a beautiful torte and delicous too. I have made this about 5 times since 1999.

This was a fabulous cake, well worth the time that it takes to make. I added the puree between layers, a great addition. I got rave reviews and am making it again for Christmas dinner.

Got a standing ovation for this one. I added two TBSP of Grand Marnier to the puree and the icing. I also brushed the cakes with Grand Marnier. Very simple but many steps. Extremely moist if you follow the instructions, and there is plenty of frosting. I will definately make this one again.

This is a beautiful thing to present. My family loves nutty, earthy tastes, which prevail even in the face of the fruits. We loved it.

I served this just a couple of hours ago as the final course of Christmas dinner. The presentation is wonderful. Several people took pictures of it. The cake was good, but not great.

Fabulous! I've made this cake several times and with spectacular results. It's the only dessert that is repeatedly requested every Christmas at my dessert buffet. I add a couple tablespoons of Gran Marnier to the orange frosting. Also, it helps to brush the cakes with Gran Marnier before assembling. Also, I let the pears rest in the cranberry sauce over night to give them a deeper color. I find that the cake should be made and assembled at least 1 day in advance. It always seems to be better after day 2!

I thought this was a lot of work for just an OK torte. It tasted like a gormet fruitcake in my opinion. The presentation was beautiful, however the taste was a little disappointing.

i spent an afternoon preparing this dessert, and while the labor was fun, the end result was so-so. the frosting was delicious, but the torte itself did not have the right balance of spicy and sweet, in my opinion. too much work for a less than tremendous outcome

I have made this torte 2 years in a row now for the Holidays. It has become a staple for my family and is much anticipated for this year again! A Beautiful dessert with wonderful flavor.

This was a pretty good recipe, wonderful to look at. However, I found I didn't have enough frosting so made another 1/2 recipe when I realized. I found that the torte itself was rather dry. I added a layer of puree to the middle, and drizzled more puree around. Looked lovely, and was good but not great, in my opinion.

I don't enjoy making desserts. This looked and sounded so good I just had to try it for Christmas. It was not hard, but has a number of steps. The recipe is written perfectly and my torte turned out just like the photograph. I was worried that its taste could not live up to its presentation, but it certainly did.

Great recipe and presentation especially for Christmas - hence the name! For a non-dessert cook it was well worth the effort. It was not hard just a few steps. Nice that it can be made a couple of days ahead.
