If you cut this into bite-sized pieces, it's a great hors d'oeuvre for a big party and serves many more than 8. I've made this recipe several times and follow it to the letter, except for cutting back the salt in the crust to 1 teaspoon.

This was okay, but probably wouldn't make it again. I added chopped rosemary to the dough, which tasted very good. I wouldn't call this dish a "tart", as the crust is more like a pizza. No problem with any soggy onions. I might try the onions on some other "tart-like" crust.

This is a wonderful hors d'oeuvre. It really was not alot of work, it just takes some time to prepare. After reading the other reviews, I decided to prepare the onions the night before. I used less oil, as others suggested (slightly less than 1/4c). To decrease the sogginess that others mentioned I covered the onions with a paper towel, rather than parchment paper, while they cooked, drained them into a bowl lined with a paper towel, poured off the excess liquid, and then stored them in a paper towel lined bowl in the refrigerator overnight. I prepared the dough exactedly as given. It was kind of sticky (but it was pretty humid), but using floured hands, it spread pretty easily to the size suggested. The result was a flavorful tart with a nice slightly crispy crust. The minimal leftovers were very good the next day.

Good. I made a test batch of tartlets using the Flaky Cream Cheese Pie Crust from this site. Onions took over two hours, and to help evaporate the liquid, I removed the parchment from the onions after they had softened significantly. Tartlets were okay, but then I topped a couple of them with finely chopped rosemary and a couple drops of good balsamic when they came out of the oven, and that made them much better.

Really good. Four people polished this off and that was just the appetizer! I had a hard time stretching the dough to fit the dimensions given - and thus thought I had too many onions so I didn't use all of them. Wish I had because they are really tasty! Definately will make again but will either use a different dough recipe or try to stretch as thin as possible.

i don't know what i did wrong!! my onions were a soupy mess despite draining at the end and using less oil. i also made a mistake and used puff pastry which made it greasy and not crisp. the onions were also not sweet--and i cooked them on low for 1.25 hours. any suggestions?

I made this as an appetizer for Easter dinner and it was a big winner. Time consuming to make, but I made the caramelized onions the day before to save a little time. One recommendation - drain, drain, drain the onions after cooking or the oil may be a bit much in the final product. Overall, delicious and everyone loved it, would definitely make it again.

I used frozen puff pastry crust to make it easier, and it was delicious

Very tasty. It was a little tricky getting the dough to spread out to the dimensions the recipe called for. The tart came out delicious! It was worth the effort. I would use less oil in the onions next time.

This was amazing. I used a premade pie crust to save time and it was still so amazing. It is definitely sweeter than you would expect, but savory also.

This was delicious, and was very nice as an appetizer. I had a hard time with the dough, and actually had to make it twice because the first time it just came out as a sloppy mess. It seems that no one else had to add a ton of extra flour, so maybe I did something wrong. Who knows. Next time I'll either flour the baking sheet or spray it with non-stick spray, because the tart was very difficult to chip off.

This is a great recipe. I used my electric pressure cooker to carmelize the onions & a bread machine to make the dough...it was a "piece of cake!" Really, even if you have a stand mixer with a dough hook, don't be afraid to try the yeast dough; it wouldn't be the same without that kind of dough. I've made this twice; the 2nd time I substituted some of my sourdough starter for the flour & liquid & it was even better. I concur with the reader who wrote "don't skimp on the mustard"; the given amount is a little light for my taste. I also made the spiced orange wine recipe...it was fabulous as well...a perfect accompaniment.

This was very tasty. I think it would make a good appetizer, cut into small squares and served room temp. We ate it more like pizza, as a whole meal, and I probably wouldn't do that again. It took a really long time to caramelize the onions, about 1 1/2 hours at least. Next time I would use a little less oil, maybe 1/4 cup instead of 1/3. I increased the amount of mustard and am glad I did. I also used white whole wheat flour, which worked very well. I only wish I'd rolled the dough out even thinner. It seemed really thin, but fattened up a bunch in the oven. Should be rolled as thin as possible and then some. Easy to make. There's a great recipe for caramelized onions in a slow cooker on this site that I highly recommend.

very good. the onions are delicious and would be fabulous with mushrooms. Next time ill use more mustard and make sure dough is very thin (otherwise its more like a pizza)

The topping was delicious, though I subbed a little fresh fennel for some of the onion. Did not particularly care for the crust - the texture reminded me of school cafeteria pizza. I would prefer either a thinner (more chewy) crust or perhaps a thin puff pastry crust.

Absolutely fantastic! I didn't change a thing and I'm glad. The onions had a lot of liquid left at the end of cooking, but otherwise no changes are necessary.

Very easy (despite long rising time) and a big crowd pleaser. Delicious the next day in lunch box. Works well as hors d'oeuvre at party or as one of three veggie dishes for dinner.

We love this recipe. I grow really sweet onions and this is a good way to use some of them up. Don't scrimp on the mustard. Deeelicious.

The flavors in this tart are exceptional. It's also easy to make. I used a bread machine on the dough setting while the onions were cooking and the dough still turned out perfectly.

This was not good. Maybe I did something wrong, but it took almost two hours for the onions to carmelize, and even then they weren't very sweet. This was too onion-y for me.

Low on time when my bread wasn't rising fast enough so I used flakey biscuits in the tube :-( and made small tarts instead of one large one... pressed a glass in each biscuit to form edge and it worked well!

Excellent flavor, a real treat. The recipe was way off on the flour to water ratio, however. I added a lot of flour.

This was delicious. The crust was moist and the topping sweet. I used less olive oil than called for for and it was still delicious (although the onions started sticking to the bottom of the pan).

This was delicious - a real hit on my Easter table. Unfortunately I completely forgot the yeast at the store, & used puff pastry instead - but the onions were the hit anyway, so I doubt it mattered. Will try the other way next time.

I made this for a picnic with friends, and it disappeared in a flash! The dough at first seemed like it would not possible stretch as far as suggested, however the crust turned out beautiful and thin. I cooked the onions over a higher heat, with lid off, for the last 15 minutes as the mixture was very sloppy initially. Very yummy!
