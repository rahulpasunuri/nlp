Very easy and delicious. I added as much fresh tarragon as thyme and it gave me the soup an interesting flavour. I also did not use as much butter and used half-and-half instead of heavy cream. The soup was still plenty creamy and the half-and-half mellowed the celeriac flavour considerably (I might prefer the iteration without the dairy).

I really liked this bisque. 3 1/2 forks really. I ommited the potato, added a few garlic cloves with the shallots. I used the celery tops, after washing them throughly. Finished with rosemary parmesan croutons (w a touch of cayenne), green onions, and truffle salt. Yum!

this was my 1st attempt cooking with celery root, and what a SUCCESS!! it had a rich, velvety, creamy texture (even though i omitted the cream entirely). other changes: only used 2T of butter + subbed in a little EVOO. i also subbed homemade turkey stock. fantastic healthy soup!

I made this a couple weeks ago and loved it. Today I made it again and added thinly sliced lemongrass stalk, WOW! A nice addition of flavor in my opinion.

Crumble some bacon on it before serving, bacon makes everything better.

GREAT SOUP! This was easy and delicious and has me thinking of other components that would add even more to this, like a brunoise of apple or adding some fennel. Can't wait to make it again!!!

Awesome as written. I think the few posters who thought it was blah probably hadn't salted it adequately. Potato in a low-sodium chicken broth can quickly make a soup base taste like dishwater unless you titer the salt. Easy and quick. Now I have a go-to recipe for this farmer's market staple.

Indeed, where are the croutons?? I have made this and it is delicious, but wonder what happened to the last bit of the recipe.

This soup is marvelous if you drizzle truffle oil on it.

I made this recipe exactly as written - the flavor was very mild, the consistency too thick, and where the heck are the croutons - it really needed a crunchy topping - - - highly over rated at 4 forks!

This was so good! I used about half of the required butter and cream, still very creamy and delicious. I added a whole red onion because I didn't have any shallots as well as some mixed frozen herbs. Very rich, flavorful and super easy to make.

People really loved this soup at dinner (one of my friends returned for thirds). I found this to have very basic, subtle flavors. I wouldn't necessarily choose this over any other soup. Not worth the effort of hunting down celery root, in my opinion.

This was great, even with no cream. The shallots are a good idea as yellow onion might be too strong. I used a parmesan, well, romano rind as another reviewer suggested. Easy and delicious.

Very nice and easy soup. I used buttermilk instead of heavy cream and cut out almost all the butter to make it healthier. Next time I would add a lot more onions and/or shallots and increase the salt and pepper. Definitely a keeper for a quick weekday meal.

A MAZ ING !! Most delicious soup I have ever made. so simple, so tasty! I had never cooked with celeriac before and found some at the farmers' market this week. I used yellow onion because I am out of shallots and it was still fantastic. This also tasted great without the cream but I put it in anyway..yum. Hmm, think I'll go heat some leftover soup now!

My husband made this for me tonight, and it was so so good. It doesn't even need the croutons. It's perfect as is. Your guests will love it and your family will request it for holiday meals...like I just did.

I love blended soups and this one is a new addition to my many fav's. I made an addition - I cut up some chirizo into thin disk -then fried them up and topped some over each individual bowl A little fancy touch Perfect balance of mild, spicy and salty

I made several changes to make this recipe healthier: used 1 tablespoon of olive oil instead of butter, no whipping cream, and added a diced sweet potato. Ended up adding a couple of cups of water too. The flavor of the celeriac came through.

Thie soup is fabulous. I was concerned because I didn't make it a day before but it didn't matter. Raves all around the table!! I don't know why the title says 'croutons' because there aren't any.

I was really surprised by this soup! I didn't have fresh thyme on hand, and all of the stores in my area were out of it as well. However, I used 2 tbsp of a vegan No Chicken bouillon concentrate mixed with the 2 cups of water, and the soup was truly flavorful! Even my 15 month old enjoyed it! Also, for anyone looking to veganize this recipe, instead of the whipping cream, substitute a dollop of Tofutti sour cream as the garnish.

Delicious! Definitely make the day before. I tasted it right after making and was dubious, but this morning it's GREAT, even cold. I skipped the small amount of celery and used 1 large onion, no shallot. I will garnish with chopped Kalamatas and maybe some lemon zest for an Easter feast this afternoon, with bunny-shaped croutons (just had to use that cookie cutter).

I made this with leeks and onions instead of shallots, and omitted the potato as I had a very large celeriac. I also added a small bit of parmesan cheese rind to simmer with the soup.

For a more elegant version of this, try putting it through a chinois (very, very fine strainer), then whip cream with truffle oil (no sugar of course) and dollop that along with tiny brioche and pink lady apple croutons on top.

I had an organic celery root in my fridge (from my CSA), so I used this recipe to use it. BUT I sub'd a lot of things - it was incredible sub'd olive oil for half the butter instead of thyme I used fresh cilantro (and 1/4 cup) added chopped mild peppers to the celery added 3 cloves chopped garlic used yellow onions instead of shallots added dash or two of tabasco after I pureed it, I added sour cream instead of whip cream. Just a dollop per serving. very flavorful - perfect for Tday or cold afternoons. should freeze well also (freeze before adding sour cream).

My Thanksgiving guests seemed to LOVE this as am elegant first course. I'm only giving 3/4 forks because I alone thought it was good, not great. But I will probably make again due to the reaction of the crowd.

This was surprisingly light and refreshing. I recommend it. The only part that could be considered hard, is preparing the celeriac, as it can be quite tough.

This soup pleases all who taste it. My husband (who hates blended soups), my two year old (who hates celery), my gourmand friends and myself all loved it. I used a little more butter than called for and let the celery and shallots brown for flavor before continuing. I found making it the night before it is to be served enhances flavor and doesn't require as much salt as you would initially think. I garnished with lots of fresh thyme which was magical against the creamy soup. This is my new Christmas Eve soup. (A tip for the celairic - cut the root in large slices about 1 inch thick, then lay each slice flat and cut off the skin as if you were cutting the crust off a pizza).

I made this soup as the first course to my Thanksgiving dinner (serving 12). Overall, I thought it was good, and I may or may not make it again. I added a splash of extra cream because I thought the soup was a bit thick without it and I was looking for a creamier flavor and texture. The soup was extremely bland until I added quite a bit of salt and pepper. I used a coursely ground pepper that looked really nice. I may have over salted a bit... I like salt but a few of my guests found it too salty. I was surprised how it went from really bland to quite good with just a bit of salt. I did not make the thyme croutons and I didn't miss them. I garnished with chopped chives.

This soup was delicious, and it really did have an exceptional texture. Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorite meals for a cold [summer] San Francisco night. I have never made the croutons, and usually skip the whipping cream. I blend about half of the soup, and leave the other half chunky-- gives it a nice texture, and you never miss the cream (it's so much healthier that way!). I think I'll make it again tonight!

This soup is fantastic! It's so delicious. I added 2 potatoes and increased the amount of broth to 7 or 8 cups and it's the thickest soup I have ever made. The celeriac flavour is definitely there (I was afraid it would be bland). I would definitely make this as a first course for company.

I made this as a first course for my family on Thanksgiving. I'd never used cereliac before but it sounded interesting. A delicious start to a rich meal, it gently opened the palate with its velvety smoothness and delicate flavor. Everyone loved it.

Fantastic recipe - quick and simple, and yields a gorgeous, velvety rich soup. I didn't make the croutons, but didn't miss them. I agree with the reviewer who said to pay attention to the salt - I was surprised how much was needed to bring out the flavors. This will definitely be one of my winter staples.

I almost never cook with recipes, preferring the seat of my pants approach. But I love celeriac, so I knew I'd be making this more than once, so I decided to try it as written the first time. I may not change it. I liked it, my wife LOVED it (and she doesn't love celeriac). The only changes were using a stick blender, as I don't own a stand blender, and using half and half instead of cream, as the market was out of organic, non-BHG heavy cream, and I'm staying away. (NOT a health issue for most, but my guest has a kidney disease that makes it important for her.) I think it would be better with the cream.

Outstanding! We made this for our 2nd course for Valentine's Day Dinner and velvet is definitely the word to describe it! Easy to make and not so "unhealthy" with only 1/4 cream for the whole pot. I made it early in the day, sans cream, and added the cream when reheating. Forgot to add the addt'l chopped thyme with the croutons as a garnish (although I had it chopped and ready to go) and it was still delicious. Highly recommend this recipe and we plan to try more things with celery root (this was our first experience with it). Actually had to use google images to find out what it looked like before going out shopping for it.

We made this again for guests and the soup received rave reviews. I found the recipe for thyme croutons through a search (it was with a cauliflower soup recipe that appeared in the same edition of the magazine) and the croutons really added a nice touch.

Full-bodied yet delicately flavored, the perfect soup for a cold winter's day. Instead of thyme croutons, I just served it with a dollop of freshly whipped cream in the center.

We did not have fresh thyme so I substituted a lessor amount of dried thyme to be cooked with the soup. Fresh thyme, purchased and added as garnish to the soup the next day, really was lovely with the soup. A nice comforting, relatively healthy soup.

Delicious! Like all soups it benefits from an overnight rest in the fridge. Be sure to taste for salt-I found that I had to be fairly generous. Drizzling each serving with truffle oil made it special.

Great for a starter. I made this soup and served it in demitasse cups. First, I put a little maple syrup on the bottom of each cup, then poured in the soup. As the guests finished sipping the soup, the bit of maple syrup came through at the end. It was a perfect starter to the meal.
