This is my husband's favorite recipie - and he asks me to make it at least twice a month! I've nver been very good a gravy, but it's his favorite part (and he is also quite a gravy connoisseur).

This was alright, but I don't think I'll make it again. My significant other, who happens to be a connoisseur of gravy, wasn't too impressed with the gravy in this recipe -- probably because it's lighter & heathier than what he's used to.

My 9 year old daughter, Mariah, made this for dinner last night. We doubled the recipe and it turned out excellent! We didn't have any fresh parsley so we used Basil, and we served it alongside Roasted Garlic Cous Cous and Lemon Thyme Broccoli. This is a winner!

I make this quite often, even my picky children like it. I use unsalted homemade broth, then salt to taste before serving.

I found this to be very, very ordinary. The gravy was odd tasting and the chicken was boring. I was excited about the flavors going into it, but I think it was just too much combined in one dish. My dining companion said he enjoyed it, but I think he was being nice. I will not make this again.

I made this in a cast iron skillet, and it is very simple and surprisingly tasty. I thought there would not be enough gravy, but it was enough. With vegetables and rice it turned out to be a perfect dinner for two. Do not substitute salted broth or butter - I think it can easily become too salty.
