I also think this would've been better with more prominent anchovy and lemon flavors. I'd add more next time.

I made this with red potatoes and received kudos from someone who is not a big potato fan at all. I think it would have been better had the anchovies been more prominent. I suppose it depends on how much you love them. The garlic made this dish.
