Yes, agree with previous reviews that recipe made too much sauce - but it freezes well. Sauce was delicious and ridiculously easy. I grilled the lamb and it came out great!

I agree it makes a lot of sauce, but it has a lovely flavor. Served chops with lemon couscous made with preserved lemons which really complimented the dish.

Pretty good, and a nice use of zaatar other than just sprinkling on pita. It does make a lot of sauce.

This was not very impressive. The sauce and the lamb do not go very well together. The quantity of sauce is enormous, also - could probably cut it in half at least.
