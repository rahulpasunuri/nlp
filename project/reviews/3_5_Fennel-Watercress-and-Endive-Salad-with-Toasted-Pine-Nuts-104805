this is my absolute favorite salad. I love the fennel mixed with fruit (orange sections work wonderfully as well), parmesan and pine nuts with the peppery watercress... it's just so flavorful and fun. A perfect salad

I made this as part of an elaborate dinner for relatives. Everyone loved it, and it was good, but as another reviewer noted, the fennel overpowered everything. I would make it again for company, because it's glamorous, but I wouldn't make it as part of a dinner for myself. It needs something, and I cant figure out what it is.

loved it. Simple, colorful, flavorful. I used orange sections instead of apple because I love orange and fennel together, it was delicious with the pine nuts. I might try a different cheese next time..

Had to substitute regular endive for Belgian and added arugula. also, only 1/2 of a fennel bulb is necessary. the dressing was lovely just as written.

This was a nice variation from the straight balsamic/olive oil drizzle that I do. The mild endive got completely overpowered, however, and so I will do a combo of watercress and arugula next time instead.

I liked it, and maybe I'd make it again, but it wasn't mind-blowing for all the work and expensive ingredients. I used red endive to add color and fine, aged balasamic - good, but no wow! I could have made a simple green salad and my guests would have felt the same.

This salad made me look like a pro. The flavors are wonderful and the textures are great. I did cheat in that I tossed in just a touch of balsamic vinager with the salad but still added the balsamic reduction which can also decorate the plate, if you have a steady hand.

Nice, easy. Would make it again but reducing the fennel...

This salad is very good. The second time I made it, I left the endive whole for a better presentation.
