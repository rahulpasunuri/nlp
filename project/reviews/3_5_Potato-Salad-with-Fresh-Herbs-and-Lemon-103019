This is delicious but doesn't need anywhere near the amount of olive oil called for. I used about 1 1/2 T and it made for a really delicious light salad. Used all the herbs from my garden - mint, oregano, tarragon, basil, and rosemary, and chives. The lemon really brightens it up. Made a great side dish with grilled lamb chops.

I took to a BBQ and it got great reviews from the guests. Changed the herbs to what I had, thyme, parsley and basil, but will try the stronger herbs as suggested in the recipe next time. Definitely a keeper.

I made this as noted but with less oil and red pepper instead of green. Otherwise used the three herbs and the combination was really different. Liked it immensely. Am making again right now!

This is a wonderful, fresh, mayo-free potato salad that keeps safely at room temperature for hours. I used baby Yukon gold potatoes, quartered lengthwise. Raves from everybody. The dressing would be great on any grilled veggies or pasta.

I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand, so made it with everything else (substituting green onion for white). It still tasted wonderful and was a big hit. Highly recommended to use a high quality olive oil.

I love all potato salad. Not this one. And I followed the recipe exactly. I hesitate to rate it because so many people seem to like it. The peppers react strangely with the lemon and oil for a bitter, tangy, swimming in oil mess.

Nice light potato salad. For leftovers, try sauteing. It turns this into an entirely new and equally delicious dish.

This potato salad was absolutely delicious. I altered the recipe only slightly: I used basil, parsley and thyme, as those were the herbs I had on hand. The green pepper added a wonderful flavor. It was a hit with everyone at dinner. Paired it with grilled salmon and a green salad.

This was the best potato salad I have ever made. But it is very different than the usual mayonnaise or sour cream versions. It's lighter and fresher. I did use celery instead of green pepper but otherwise did not change anything. I used 1 tsp of salt and a lot of fresh ground pepper.

this was very good. i used peeled russet potatoes b/c i happened to have a bag. there was not too much dressing as someone said--it was just right. i used 1 red pepper instead of green, vidalia onion, no cilantro and chives instead. i also used 1/4 cup of parsley.

Served it at a BBQ. and everyone wanted the recipe.

I just brought this salad to a potluck and everyone loved it. I combined this recipe, which I liked because of the herbs and because it didn't include mayo, with some items from a traditional potato salad recipe. I added celery and hard-boiled eggs (and quite a bit more salt). Very tasty!

I don't care for peppers so I left them out, but this salad is outstanding in every way. Unlike other cooks here, I thought the lemon and herbs were perfect. I've made it four times and it's delightful on a warm summer day. Who needs mayonnaise with potatoes anymore?

The ingredients worked nicely together, but I felt the final dish was lacking without a strong dose of salt. Also, I ended up needing only about half the dressing and was annoyed that I wasted so much. Other than that, though, a tasty addition to my repertoire!

Tangy, savoury, really a perfect side dish. My new favourite potato salad recipe.

Absolutely delicious - easy to follow recipe which was beautiful for a summer BBQ. None left at the end of the day...

Add a dab of Dijon and omit the cilantro, it over powers the salad, basil and parsley are most adequate! A few turns of freshly ground pepper are the Coup de Grace!

Very good --everyone liked this. The dressing is light and delicious (I added just a bit more lemon juice to taste). I added the herbs just before serving as suggested and the salad looked great.

I used half of a red and orange sweet pepper; the dish was very colourful and festive. Before adding the herbs, I snuck a bite of potato. The lemony dressing was intense and bright, really quite good. It was maybe a bit too oily, other than that, very enjoyable. This changed once I added the herbs. Even though I'd used a lighter touch on the cilantro and mint, they both overwhlemed the salad, almost erradicating the lemony flavour. What a disappointment- I didn't finish what was on my plate (nor did my guests), and I threw the remainder into the composting pile. Sans the herbed mixture, this would be very good. If I make it again, I'd probably add only basil, or some parsley to the potatoes.

Am about to make this for the third time this summer (that's a lot for me!) after rave reviews the last couple of times. I'll boil the potatotes tonight and mix up the onions, peppers and dressing ingredients, minus the herbs, then mix everything together about an hour ahead of serving.

This was a VERY tasty addition to our family BBQ. I used blue and red potatoes and red onion, which gave the salad a beautiful rainbow of colours. Made it yesterday, gave it an additional toss today to make sure the dressing was evenly distributed. I used herbs from my garden, and they didn't go gray as a previous reviewer wrote. The flavours were nice and subtle. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was a winner. Everyone who tries it loves this salad. If you make it ahead of time, I recommend saving a good portion of the herbs to add at the last minute. They do tend to turn grey. The salad still tastes great either way.

Sorry, folks. The lemon flavor was just too overpowering for me on this one - and I love interesting taste combinations. Next time I'll try an oil potato salad with vinegar or white wine.

Huge hit at my party!

I made this to try it out before a party next weekend. I simply love it! It has such a fresh, clean flavor as everyone else has alluded to. I also made with red pepper (roasted) as I had one large one left in a jar. I also added 1 tsp of dijon mustard to the dressing and cut back slightly on the onions. [A cup seemed way too much for 2 1/4 pounds of potatoes? Maybe it's just my taste.] Anyway, I can't emphasize how delicious this is. The mixture of fresh herbs is wonderful together. I thought it would be too strong, but it wasn't at all. Last note: use a good quality extra virgin oil. You must try this!

Rcv'd good comments on this salad dish from guests. Nice mix of lemon, herbs with the potato.

I quite enjoyed this dish because it used up my mint from the garden and it was something "just a little bit different". If I had my way, I would make it again, but my husband, on the other hand, did not care for the "green stuff". Make it anyways, if you like the clean flavour of lemon, olive oil and the "green stuff"

My eight guests for July 1 (Canada Day) BBQ were unwitting guinea pigs for this salad - you can imagine how relieved I was to hear the great raves - I also added red pepper for colour - a definite do-again!

This potato salad is delicious, very light, but very flavorful. I used a red pepper instead, however to add more color and contrast with the herbs. By the way, I am making it again today for a dinner party.

Very easy dish that is an interesting twist on potato salad. I enjoyed it very much. Left out the green pepper (didn't have one on hand) and used a regular yellow onion. I think next time I might try something more milder. But otherwise, it's great! In fact, this one inspired me to grow basil, mint and cilantro! Try it!

We thought this was excellent!! The only thing that I disagreed with was that it was said to be good for all year long. I thought it was a bit "summer-y" for the winter. I can't wait to start taking it to picnics!
