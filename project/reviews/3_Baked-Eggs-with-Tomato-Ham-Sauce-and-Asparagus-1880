I only made the sauce and served it with a crustless aparagus quiche. It was a little bland, but I liked the idea. Next time I would saute the onions, ham and mushrooms quite a bit longer to get more flavor from them. And at the last minute throw in some fresh herbs.

I've made this to rave reviews on several ocassions. It can be assembled ahead of time then popped in the oven when brunch guests arrive. I've always made it with ginger scones (also on this site). Equally loved by my gourmet friends and more pedestrian in-laws.

Different. That's the only word we could come up with to describe this dish...Interesting flavor combination. We ate it, but for the first and last time.

Terrific! Really special and different, straightforward preparation. Sauce cooking time was longer than estimated for me (about 15 minutes after adding tomatoes) as the sauce should be thick enough to make a well for the egg. Do not be tempted to add any herbs. The sauce does not need salt.
