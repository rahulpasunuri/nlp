I used this mayo as a sauce for broiled flank steak and the outcome was fantastic. Im sure it works great with tuna also and cant wait till summer to try it out.

This was easy and delicious but I agree that the mayo taste was a bit overwhelming. I would kick up the wasabi and lemon and swap out a portion of mayo for something else, maybe yogurt or sour cream as others have suggested. It does make a lot of dipping sauce so you could reserve less mayo for the wasabi dipping sauce and marinate more tuna. It was delicious and I can see how it would rate highly among crowd favorites as an appetizer. I will certainly make this again. I used fresh tuna that I caught yesterday off of Cape Cod. This recipe makes your house smell like a sushi restaraunt! Overall, DELICIOUS and simple.

The marinade is excellent! The first time I made it, I got asked to make it for another BBQ. The second time, I added a bit of fresh grated ginger and it was even better. This is a keeper.

This was fair, because I don't have a barbecue grill. BUT, the concept is great. Next time, I'll skip the marinating, use sushi-grad tuna, sear it in one piece in a hot pan or grill pan, cut into serving pieces, and serve with Trader Joe's wasabi mayo.

I used ahi, marinated steaks whole, cut down mayo by 1/3, subbed in sourcream, used baggie to marinate, about 4 hours. Flash -seared in pan with a little olive oil. Slice on side or cube with mayo on the side. The mayo is a tan coloured after prepared - if you want more green for presentation, simply add a bit of food colouring. Excellent.

I doubled the recipe to serve 10 as an appetizer, and there wasn't a bite left. As someone recommended, I added sour cream to the sauce to cut the mayo flavor, as well as quite a bit more lemon juice and a little bit more sugar. I seared the kebabs in olive and sesame oil over medium high heat for just under two minutes so they were still rare inside. They absolutely melted in your mouth -- I can't recommend this dish more.

This was really good and sooo easy to make--perfect appetizer. The tuna had a great flavor and the mayo was awesome. Definitely a keeper, I can't wait to serve it to company. Next time I'll try it, like suggested, with more wasabi to try the difference, but it was great just as it was.

I use this sauce recipe all of the time. I've been using it for 3 years and just finally got around to writing a review. I've made the recipe which is EASY and delicious - but we use the sauce for so much more than this recipe!! Try having fondue (meat/oil) and serving this as one of your sauces!!

Really terrific dish! So simple to make and really flavorful. We added more wasabi to increase the heat; served w/lots of radish sprouts, lime wedges and jasmine rice!

A delightful dish that we come back to again and again. I think that we have been making this one for 5 years now - have yet to grow tired of the tasty simplicty of this recipe.

A wonderful appetizer. Easy to prepare and delicious. I grilled the tuna steak whole and then cut it up into pieces and served it with toothpicks. I also added extra wasabi powder to give it more kick. Will definitely make it again.

Not a big fan of fish I used this paste on salmon too. IT was fabulous. The mayo-wasabi dip was the best with asparagus.

This was good but not great. Followed the recipe exactly but cut down a bit on the mayonnaise. Enjoyed the dipping sauce, but believe there are other, better ways to prepare fresh tuna.

This is the best appetizer I've ever made. The wasabi mayo is great with the sates. I added a little extra lemon in the marinade and little extra soy in the dipping sauce. I recommend cooking over pretty low heat.

My husband and I, along with several guests, LOVED this recipe. I made several different types of marinades for fresh Yellow Fin Tuna as well as fresh Dorado (Mahi Mahi) and we put this mayo on the teriyaki ones as well. I made it hot so we did not need too much but it was terrific. I will definitely make this one again. It was good to have it along with other marinades for variety.

I must give thumbs down to this dish. The texture was odd and there really wasn't much flavor. Further, it was an expensive experiment with disappointing results. I will not make this again.

I agree with most everyone else. This recipe was fantastic. I made it for my family and they loved it. So I tried it as an appetizer at a dinner party and it was a hit. I would recommend it to anyone.(Novice or otherwise)

I SO wanted to love this, if only to spite some pretentious members who apparently are unaware that the tuna/mayo combo is actually considered quite gourmet in Japan. Anyhow... what did I do wrong? The marinade did keep the tuna tender and succulent, producing lovely grill marks as would a yogurt-based marinade. The mayonnaise was somewhat overpowering to my tastebuds. We also found that if the tuna chunks were crowded together too much on the skewers, the parts of the tuna that didn't brown had an odd texture. We will try this again with significant revisions - no mayo in the marinade, probably go with a shoyu-lime-sesame oil or cut the mayonnainse with yogurt or something.

Y'know what I love? Cooks who say things like, "This recipe is for novices who don't appreciate the taste of fresh tuna or wasabi. Sorry folks, you're wrong." The only appropriate response is, "Bite me." Don't tell me what I'm allowed to like, pal. This is a fantastically good use for tuna or any other meaty fish.

Good. I agree with many other reviewers on various points. The amount of marinade is fine, but the amount of dipping sauce is ridiculously large. I also would like to try improving the flavor -- maybe replacing at least some of the mayo with sour cream, increasing the sugar and lemon juice? Adding bright red tomatoes or bell peppers to the skewers does sound like a good suggestion. And yes, the tasty dipping sauce is a dull beige color. As for the reviewers who say this masks or ruins the taste of good tuna/wasabi, well, yes, super fresh tuna with wasabi just can't be matched by any other preparation :) But this is a different type of dish, and I figure it has its own place.

I start with Wasabi Mayonnaise from Trader Joe's, then add the other ingredients. This is a fantastic tasting dish, we love it.

I loved the sauce, and will make over with many fish dishes. I felt that the tuna should stand on it's own though. Good tuna doesn't need to be covered with a mayo marinade and then a dip as well. Shark would be a good choice to do this with, as per recipe. Will definately do over!

This recipe was excellent. I too thought the mayo marinate was a strange one - but it was out of this world. For the skeptics - you should have cooked it on the grill. The combination of the smoky flavor from the grill and browning of the mayo was terrific!

Agree w/ "Cook". The result was terrible. The wasabi was overwhelming and the fish had a strange texture with all that mayo. I will not waste the $$ on sashimi grade tuna to try this one again.

Loved this recipe - will make this again. Next time I will add more wasabi to spice it up a bit more!!!

This was great! It really only took 5 minutes to prepare the sauce. We used only 2/3 c. mayo and kept all other ingredients as suggested. We alternated red pepper with the tuna on skewers. It gave a nice balance of sweetness to the tuna and marinade. I may make this again tonight!

I loved this dish. I was skeptical at first because I couldn't imagine using mayonaise with tuna steak, but the results were divine. I didn't have a grill so I broiled the tuna with no problems.

I've been cooking 35 years and if this isn't the BEST meal I ever prepared, it ranks right up there. I too used tuna steaks but I made a mistake and put the wasabi in the whole thing of mayo.. Consequently I pan seared the marinated tuna with the wasabi/mayo mixture on it and served the leftover as a sauce. Spectacular!!!!!

Rave reviews with our fish liking guests. I mixed wasabi into mayonaise before marinating swordfish which I substituted for tuna. Marinated overnight. Used two pounds of fish kabobs and didn't bother with skewers. Excellent.

This recipe is so yummy. My husband and I used to live in Hawaii and miss the ahi tuna. This is a great grilled fish recipe-so flavorful. I marinated the tuna all day. The key is quality, fresh tuna and not over cooking. Great!

Another WOWER from Epicurious. I don't usually like tuna other than from the can (sorry) and this was the exception since it cooks all the way through (I like my tuna to have the texture of fish, not like rare steak). You'd better double the recipe because there won't be a bite left for you! You'll need to garnish the mayo with something for a party - its the same putty color as the tuna (maybe some cilantro sprigs?) and serve it with some fresh red pepper slivers or cherry tomatoes for contrast. Better yet, put red pepper or tomatoes on the skewers with the tuna!

I almost never give four forks, but this was an absolutely delicious recipe. It was extremely easy, but I would have happily worked much harder to get the same results. This seems to make a heck of a lot of sauce--next time I think I'll double the tuna, marinate it in 2/3 of the mayonnaise mixture, and use the 1/3 C as the dipping sauce.

I didn't notice the word "Grill" in the recipe, but no matter, I spread the sauce thinly over the tuna, then seared it in a pan on the stove. I guess it worked out--they were gone before I could taste for myself.

I've made this many times for parties; it's easy and quick and people always rave about it. I use more wasabi than indicated as we like it spicy. Highly recommended.
