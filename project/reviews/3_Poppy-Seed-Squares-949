The recipe is good, but it wasn't a 'wow'. I'd recommend covering the squares with plastic wrap overnight if not eaten, the dough dries fast. Overall the recipe is good.

I wasn't used to working with this kind of batter and had my doubts about how it would turn out. It was quite good but I recommend refrigerating the second half of the batter while the bottom half is baking.

This is a good recepie, for people who love and know poppy seeds. Give it a try!!

Skip this one......squares lack pizazz or flavor for that matter. I found them dry and bland with a condensed flavorless poppyseed filling.
