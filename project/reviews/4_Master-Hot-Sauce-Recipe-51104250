This is the easiest and BEST recipe to make homemade hot sauce. It ends up tasting similar to Tabasco, but using different peppers gives it its own character. Our Thai chili pepper plant is producing so many that we've been able to make three small batches of this sauce so far and LOVING it! Soooooo happy to finally have this recipe!

I am a huge fan of Frank's Red Hot sauce so I got very excited to see this recipe. I made a half batch of this with two types of very small and extremely hot chili peppers that I grow in my garden (red and orange). I used less vinegar than called for, based on other reviews. It was very easy to make though it didn't ferment. I let it sit for more than a week as I noticed that the taste got better. What can I say: I ended up with a Tabasco type sauce that tastes extremely fresh! It's really good!I am now making my second batch for friends, to this one I added a clove of garlic (like Tabasco and Franks have). I am curious to see how it will taste. I plan to experiment with milder hot peppers as well. Remember to use gloves or wash your hands well and keep them away from your eyes. This recipe is a keeper.

I made it with 1/4 lb habanero, 1/4 lb red chili, and one big orange bell pepper, and it is so delicious! It's hot, but not unbearable, and the flavor has a great sweetness. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white. I let it sit for four days. Now I'm making two more batches, one with only jalapeno and one with only red thai chilis.

What a great way to use the excess of peppers from the garden! I made poblano and habanero this round. The only down side is that the brillant green of the green peppers is destroyed in the presence of acid (so the picture is a bit deceptive), but the color of the habanero is great. Would love to have the solids suspended, but this is a project for next year!!! Agree totally with akadar that the solids are as good as the sauce. I've been adding it to all kinds of dishes. Can't wait till next summer to experiment with some other peppers,herbs etc.

I used only fresh small red hot chilies and followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. The taste is a little vinegary but I like that. Its not as hot as I thought it would be but the flavor is excellent. A couple suggestions: 1. Just cut off the stem and use the entire pepper including seeds and membranes. 2. Retain the solids after pressing them, add a little of the hot sauce back into it and save it in a glass jar. It also has great flavor and has two or three times the heat of the sauce. Add it to chili, pasta sauce or anything that you want to have more heat. It would be a waste to throw it away. Of course this might depend on the type of pepper you used. Mine is like a homemade Sambal Oelek.

I made this with yellow scotch bonnet chilies. It was easy. I love it! I plan to play around with it using different chilies, different vinegars and some herbs.

Just bottled my first sauce. Used all Frenso chilis. First off, the color is beautiful, bright red. It is a little vinegary, like a Tabasco or Texas Pete. The taste, in my opinion, is much better. Some of the fruity notes of the chilis are apparent. Being my first time, I followed the recipe strictly. However, I feel it may be possible to reduce the vinegar some. I Adding sugar may balance some of the vinegar and adding spices may be something to consider as your comfort level with this recipe grows. I wouldn't recommend removing seeds or ribs as the heat is predominantly there, unless you are trying to lower the heat. I would consider adding carrots to lower heat (might make the color weird on green chilis though). 3 stars because it is a little vinegary, but it is a great baseline recipe to start with. Next sauce will be either Serrano or habanero, which means I will be making it again. Last word of warning, I inhaled some fumes from the chili puree and it was intense. Use caution with hotter peppers or may if you have a lung condition.

I used jalapenos only, seeded and deveined. The sauce was way too vinegary, and not hot at all. Throwing this recipe away.

Had a plethora of peppers from the garden so used a mixture of mild banana peppers, hot banana peppers and jalapenos. The recipe is so easy. I let the pepper-vinegar mixture sit for three days and then pureed it in the blender. I strained it through a fine sieve and pressed on the solids. It turned out hotter than I thought it would but is so good. My husband is putting it on everything!
