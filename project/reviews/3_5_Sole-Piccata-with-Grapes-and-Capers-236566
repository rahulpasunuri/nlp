I'd give this half a fork. The sweetness of the grapes was weird and not particularly enjoyable. Edible but not something I'd make again at all.

This too will be one of those "I didn't have this so I used that" reviews that always make me laugh ("I had no fish so I used steak . . . "). I had no wine or fruit juice on hand, so I used a half-cup of fruit-flavored sparkling water, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar. It made a good substitute! I didn't have grapes, but I had lovely yellow grape tomatoes. Excellent. I don't like using white flour so I skipped that step, which I'm sure would make the dish even better; instead I cooked down the juices and added a couple of pinches of cornstarch. It's a quick, tasty meal. I agree that more capers would improve it.

Easy to make at 6pm after work, kids liked it with a little sauce and super tasty the next day. Fave family fish recipe to date.

I should also say I added spinach to the sauce in the last few seconds and cut up fresh Roma tomatoes and placed them on the plate. Both were great additions.

I don't eat fish & I've never cooked it before this recipe. But this was super easy & tasty. I paired it with white rice cooked with salt, pepper & Adobo & took it off the stove when the rice was still a little bit wet. For the fish, I did not use any grape juice & doubled the wine amount instead based on the reviews I read & I accidentally bought cilantro instead of parsley & it was still good. I didn't follow instructions & add the capers & parsley (cilantro) at the end & I think that zapped both items of most of their flavor. But the sauce was still quite flavorful & delicious. When I make it again, I'll do that part right & I might try it with chicken breasts pounded out thin.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. Just wasn't rich enough for me. Didn't even taste the capers. I'll stick to creamy buttery sauces and stay away from the fruit, unless there's cream added. I guess this recipe is good for people who don't like fish because there was barely any taste other than the grapes.

I liked this recipe very much. I substituted tomatoes (either cut into bit sizes or grape tomatoes) and eliminated the grape juice and it was great. The tomatoes did add a little sweet taste that paired well with the capers.

Just made this again, with a few slight mods that I'll keep for next time. Cut the rather large grapes in eighths, chopped the capers, used all wine no juice, and reduced the sauce until nearly all the liquid was evaporated. The salsa-like sauce was plenty sweet without the juice, and made for more bites of fish with grape. Wish I'd had a shallot to add. Served with mashers made with skins-on red potatoes, parsley, and minced red onion, which nicely complemented the lovely pink sauce, and snap peas and baby carrots for more color; paired with a crisp Pinot Grigio. We agree, serves 2, not 4. Appreciation to everyone who takes time to review recipes, your suggestions are so helpful.

I made this for the first time at great risk as only one member of my family of 6 is fond of fish. It was a huge success and my 13 year old had two full fillet helpings. Fabulous recipe and easy.

A wonderful recipe. I added a bit of cranberry apple juice from trader joes - and seasoned the fish with some freshly ground rosemary and thyme. I used olive oil and the fish browned well. Make sure the oil is hot enough before placing the fillets into the pan. I had some black and green grapes and with the bit of red in the sauce it made a beautiful presentation.

This was tasty and easy. I didn't have grape juice, but I did have apple cider, so I used about 1/8 cup apple cider instead of the 1/4 cup grape juice -- I used wine for the remainder of the liquid called for. This worked well, and by reducing the juice component, I kept the dish a little less sweet than the recipe seems to call for.

I would suggest browning the fish in butter rather than oil.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy. I followed some other reviews for tips. I mixed S&P with flour and coated the fillets. To keep the fish warm while making the sauce, I put it on individual warmed plates in a warm oven (no sogginess). All the ingredients for the sauce were ready so it was really quick. I sautéed a shallot, 1/2 cup of wine and only 1 tablespoon of butter, as well as grapes and capers (no grape juice). Definitely will make again!

I read the reviews before making this and it turned out great using Orange Roughy filets. Some suggestions: add salt and pepper to the flour instead of sprinkling fish; peel the grapes; increase the amount of wine (2x) and add water if needed (I tripled the quantities for the sauce so I didn't run short); and prepare the fish separate from the sauce. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this recipe for the first time a few years ago for my parents. My mom hates fish, but gobbled this up. I made it again for my boyfriend and ever since he's raved to all his friends about this dish. Don't skimp on the ingredients. Get a good quality grape juice and wine and you're bound to get delicious results. I serve it with rosemary roast potatoes and a green salad.

This was a good simple, relatively inexpensive meal. I skipped the grape juice in favor of more wine and subbed tilapia for the sole but made no other changes. Will do that again. Served with some lovely asparagus and a baked potato.

I agree with a previous poster -- as fish sits waiting for the sauce, it gets cold and soggy. If I ever did this again, I'd use two pans and do sauce and fish simultaneously. That said, it was too fatty of a sauce without enough zing. My husband was happy, but he was starving.

Rating: 2
The sauce was good, but the key to making this a successful dish is cooking the sole so it is light and crispy. I failed at this. I was trying to balance too many dishes at once and let the fish sit after I dusted it in flour. I recommend going straight from the flour to a hot pan and not stacking the cooked fish while you finish the sauce. I think the next time I might try using panko instead of flour.

I did not have grapes, so I made a sauce from the fond with just wine, parsley and capers. It was delicious with the delicate flavor of the sole. The sweetness of the grapes can only make a good thing better.

A tasty addition to the 10-minute meal repertoire. I didn't have flour (go figure) or grape juice, so I substituted fine bread crumbs and doubled the wine. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I would not recommend reducing the butter, as it balances out the sauce perfectly as is. However, I would suggest doubling the recipe overall. This was the perfect amount of sauce for 2 large Petrale sole fillets. To those who found the sauce slightly bitter: I noticed this too and suspect it might be caused by the grape skins. In my sauce it was very subtle but I'd imagine different grapes could yield different results. In any event, it was a nice change of pace from the usual fish dish, and my husband loved it too. (I'd be interested to know what side dishes others used. I did new potatoes which I found very blah.)

Fantastic recipe and with very little effort, it tasted great and looked impressive on the plate. I made a couple of modifications: I added 1/4 C minced shallot to the pan before adding (2x) the wine and didn't use the grape juice. I reduced the sauce before adding the grapes as they just need to be heated through and not cooked. I waited to the very end to add the butter and parsley, too. Served a Burgundian style of Chardonnay (light, crisp, minimal oak presence, no malolactic fermentation).

This is simple and delicious. In the sauce I used a 1/2 cup of white wine and a splash of red grape juice for tang. I used only 1/2 the amount of butter for health reasons and didn't miss it. The outcome was lovely. I loved the flavor contrast of the grapes and capers and found it didn't overpower the rest of the dish. The locally caught fish was delicate in flavor and buttery in texture. I will make this again and probably for company.

Tonight I wanted to do something "different " with dover sole fillets and found this recipe. I followed it to the letter except I added a single shallot. What a bore! It would have been much better almost any way I cooked it. I'm willing, in fact anxious to try something new. However, the combo of capers and grapes just didn't do it for me.

Rating: 3
Mmmm....this was really good! My only change was to substitute Tilapia since that's what I had on hand. I love all of the different flavors in this! I can't figure out why my boyfriend didn't, but I liked it so much he's going to be stuck seeing it again so he'll get a second chance to appreciate it. And if that doesn't work, then more for me.

The flavor is too simple for 4 forks but it is quite good. I'd like to weigh in on the bitter sauce problem. I think if you cook the fish at too high heat it can leave overcooked(burnt) fond in the pan. Making a sauce with this burnt stuff certainly can give you a bitter sauce. I would suggest if you do get these to just wipe out with a paper towell and leave the good stuff. Strongly suggest a non-stick pan for this although it takes some of the flavor from the sauce. If you're good enough to pan fry sole "old school", you are my idol. Also, used wine and no grape juice. I would double the all ingredients for the sauce as the resulting quantity was skimpy.

Thought it was excellent - very tasty. Added 1/2 cup wine vs 1/4 like it called for. My 10 yr old loved the fish, not the sauce; 7 yr old wouldn't try it; husband loved it, but said the serving size was enough for 100 lb woman.

This was a great weekday recipe. I used more wine instead of the grape juice.

Follow previous suggestion and keep sole and sauce separate. This is a nice sweet and sour contrast. Use of shallot would round out the flavor as suggested

Hubby doesn't like fish, and he loved this. Noted another reviewer's objection to the grape juice, and substituted extra wine for the juice. Used black ribier grapes, which turned the sauce a lovely red shade. Will enjoy making this again.

I've never had a recipe from here turn out this bad. I'm a pretty good cook and there's nothing complicated about this recipe, so I don't think it was my error. The flavors were simply horrible. I had a gag reflex eating this sauce. It tasted like my kid spilled grape juice on my Dover sole. A simple brown butter sauce with capers is a better choice.

I came across this recipe while looking for something to do with some sole filets I already had. I didn't have any grapes so I used some sweet cherry tomatoes, straight out of the garden and still warm from the sun. It turned out beautifully and was a big hit with everyone! A very clean and healthy - and delicious - dish. Try it with the tomatoes!

Delicious combination--dover sole's delicate flavor and texture renders itself very well to a light dredging, which creates a beautiful, toothsome crunch. Let your guests add the sauce themselves right before eating to preserve this texture. I used what I had on hand--green grapes instead of red, no butter, and spanish capters in vinegar. It still worked beautifully. One of my favorite fish dishes of all times!

Wowie Kazowie! This is fabulous! No need to change a thing. The capers and grapes give a wonderful taste contrast. I used Tilapia, as no Sole available. This will work with any mild white fish. Repeater!

This is really a lovely dish -- the flavors meld nicely and it's so much more than the sum of its parts. Even though we liked it very much, I think next time I might add shallots -- not essential, but perhaps adding a bit more depth.

Loved it! the only thing to consider is the fact that Dover sole is very small. I think this recipe should only serve 2 instead of 4.

There wasn't any sole at my supermarket's seafood section, and they recently upgraded it. I made this with cod instead and it still came out delicious. Looking forward to trying it again when I can find some sole.

Met with rave reviews from even the fish-wary in my dinner for 6. I doubled the recipe without incident, but will probably triple next time since everyone went back for seconds! It was so quick and easy, ordering out would have taken longer! The only change I'd make for next time, is I'll slice the grapes into at least quarters rather than halves, just for a more pleasing texture.

This was a great quick meal--I was surprised at how tasty it was. Next time I'll increase the capers, and I won't use a truly nonstick pan--teflon made the deglazing for a pan sauce pointless.
