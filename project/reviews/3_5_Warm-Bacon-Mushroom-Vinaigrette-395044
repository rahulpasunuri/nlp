delicious! served as dressing with baby kale salad... I'm addicted! My mom made a wilted lettuce salad when I was was growing up that I always loved. This is similar, but way better, and stands up well against the hearty greens. I have been making this once/week and can't get enough - great side salad with roasted chicken.

I actually thought this was pretty horrible. The mushrooms (I used shitake) soaked up the vinegar like whoa, and just tasted like...vinegar. I had to add a ton of water and boil it off for this not to be terrible. Also, I don't understand adding water to the pot after crisping the bacon. It just get soft. Nobody likes smooshy bacon.

This dressing turned out better than I expected. It did not have that strong bracing vinegar taste of some warm vinaigrette. I served it over spinach. There was some leftover salad and I used it in a omelette the next day. Very good.
