I have made this recipe a number of times and everyone raves about it. When I discovered it about 10 years ago in the actual magazine I tried it and have used it at a number of barbecues and large party events. Both my mother in law and mother have requested that I make it which is a true test of how good it is since both of them are gourmet cooks and don't like hamburgers. Sometimes I substitute the onions by using red onions or a mixture of both and this make for a little variety. A must in your informal entertaining recipe box.

Made these tonight - only cooked 1lb and reduced all ingred respectively. Husband enjoyed his burger very much. He is a hard grader and gave it 8.5 / 10. I thought there was a smidge too much cumin. Next time I'll use less cumin. Onions were very nice! We'll make this again!

These burgers are tasty, but everyone in my family felt like the sun dried tomatoes didn't really have a place in the burger- they were just there. I think next time I will mix barbecue sauce into the burger mixture to give it some more flavor, but I'm not sure yet if there will be a next time.

I wouldn't ordinarily rate a burger with 4 forks, but yesterday my 18 year old said, totally without solicitation, that these burgers were one of the best things I have ever made. What a compliment!! And I just noticed that onions were supposed to be added to the meat-I missed that in the printed version. Anyway, like another reviewer, I would definitely recommend using a food processor to chop the tomatoes, as that is the rate limiting step here. Balsamic onions were excellent.Will definitely make this often.

A tasty and easy variation on the plain burger. We found that the cumin actually paired well with the other ingredients. Instead of grilling, I pan-fried them with a little bacon fat. And I made a quick garlic aioli with a little bit of spice.

I've made this fabulous recipe exactly as written probably a dozen times. It's so good I can't bring myself to even try other burger recipes. I've found that even after they are drained the tomatoes have enough oil to keep even very lean ground beef moist on the grill. I use a food processor to finely chop the tomatoes and puree the onion (instead of grating). This cuts down on the prep time considerably. Though these would be stunning with only the tang of the balsamic onions on top, we've also enjoyed them with a little mustard (spicy or dijon) and a slice of heirloom tomato. Just awesome.

my favorite burger recipe. I use a combination of chopped dried tomatoes with garlic and olives that is available in Israel.

I used ground turkey instead of beef - wonderful way to dress up the flavor of a bland burger. I make this regularly.

I was pretty disappointed with this. I didn't like the textural blends, and the flavor is overall just not as interesting or different than a regular ole burger, as the ingredients would lead you to believe.

This was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. I put nothing on this burger except the onions and toasted bun - no pickles, no mustard, no ketchup, no mayo, no lettuce...nothing. It tasted like it would be a $15-$20 specialty burger at a high end restaurant. I followed the recipe to a "T" except I used turkey burger - which still tasted exceptional. I would absolutely recommend trying this and the three other people I made it for raved about it! Pretty simple to make as well. My wife and I will make this for years to come.

I've made this recipe numerous times both in a pinch and for guests, and it is always a hit! Even if you don't have time to chill the meat for an hour, it is fine! The onion in balsamic is wonderful and compliments the burgers perfectly! Recipe works perfectly when halved.

Pretty good, although I might add some brie or another type of cheese into the burger mixture next time. A nice change of pace.

This is a wonderful change from the usual burger. I served this for a BBQ and my guests loved them. THey are even fine without the onions if you want to save time! You may want to reserve some plain burgers for the kids...the flavors are a bit sophisticated for young ones!

Good burgers!! Made them for a July 4th BBQ. Rave reviews from all my guests, even from some of the younsters that were adenturous enough to try these instead of the "plain" burgers. LOVED the onions. Soooo delicious!

I've made this recipe many times with great success. Marinading to onions is a must. Also as a variation I've added breadcrumbs and egg, then rolled into meatballs and baked in the oven which is very quick and tasty.

Fabulous recipe! I have made these burgers several times and each time they receive rave reviews! When your guests tell you this is the best burger they have ever had, I consider that a success. I use a mixture of 2/3 regular ground beef and 1/3 lean beef (to reduce the fire on the BBQ) and they are still very juicy.

Highly recommend - this is a great burger recipe. We didn't think it tasted anything like meatloaf, but to each his own! Some minor modifications were made: 1. We used vidalia onions and the results were great. 2. Used a mixture of ground chuck & round.

Rating: 2
Not sure what went wrong when I made it, but it tasted like meatloaf and folks said the consistency was too loose (didn't taste like meat). The onions combined with it well though. Not a bad twist to a plain burger if you want to try something different.

Made this over Memorial Day weekend while renting a cabin. Wanted easy to make recipes with a minimum of ingredients. This certainly fit the bill. As others have stated it's a nice change from standard burger fare.

They were okay. But I missed the pasta & tomato sauce that usually go with these ingredients. I added the cumin 'cause I love it. Not a good idea with these flavors. Yup! A can of diced tomatoes, a splash of cream & pasta.

This is a GREAT burger. Made them for some folks over for a BBQ and everyone loved them. I also cut the cumin.

Rating: 4
These were great. I followed the suggestion of a past reviewer and deleted the cumin. Reading the list of ingredients this is an Italian burger didn't feel that cumin would add to this. I also topped my burger with a thin slice of provolone. My husband asked where were the condiments explained that they weren't neccessary but if he felt he needed them I would serve them (none needed). Will make these burgers again.

Have made these burgers once and made meatloaf out of it once. My husband loves it. Hey Brian from Chicago..you'd be surprised...Canadians actually have heard of and use sun-dried tomatoes... not to mention lemongrass and galangal and I think we even know of turkey and chicken if I'm not mistaken. And in case you haven't heard, we actually live in houses made of brick and ride Harleys and drive cars and graduate from Med School and things like that. Wow...Canadians, eh?

They were good but not worth the effort. I added Brie cheese on a few of the burgers and this improved them, but overall not worth the effort.

A HUGE hit ~ the burgers were full of flavor (I used only chuck because it stays juicy when grilled) and the onions were a spectacular match. Now I'll be sure to keep the oil from the sun-dried tomato jar for other uses.

A fabulous burger recipe. great for variations. I did them the first time with ground buffalo. Then again with a mix of beef and spicy Italian sausage. I usually use fresh basil from the garden. I have made the onions using red or white onions, they are a great accompaniment to the burgers.

This was a taste treat, the hamburger was juicy and delicious and the onions made the dish they were out of this world. My daughter made this and I had to get on line and get a copy of the recipe.

Made these for a 4th of July BBQ - they were great! The sun-dried tomatoes really add a nice flavor, and the oil keeps the burgers from drying out (always a hazard with the hockey puck king manning the grill). Onions were fabulous.

Tried this late night - a really good burger - even my husband, an acclaimed burger-meister, said "Wow, this is really good!" I was sort on ground beef, so used 1/2 ground pork. The meister wanted cheese, so we used thin slices of provolone. Spread chipotle mayo very lightly on the buns, served with canned corn dressed up with mango pepper chutney - very nice meal for a summer Saturday eve. Recipe makes lots of patties - made a mini-meat loaf with the excess mixture.

While my husband really liked this burger, I must say I was less than thrilled. Especially in the light of all those rave reviews. It was no better than any other burger I have made with or without a recipe! But, if he asked me to make them again, of course I would...but just for him!

I hate sun dried tomatoes most of the time, and to me, a good deal of the time, a burger is just a burger. This recipe totally changed my mind on both subjects. Easily the best burger I've ever had. Don't even think of putting ketchup or mustard on this - it's way too good just the way it is. Turns a burger into something I'd be proud to serve to guests
