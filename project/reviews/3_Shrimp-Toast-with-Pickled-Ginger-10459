This is one of my favorites - however, I have altered it a great deal to save on cook time. Prepare the "shrimp paste" in the processor, then spread on sliced french bread, do a quick fry to toast the bottom of the bread and then finish the whole thing under the broiler. It is a crowd pleaser.

I've made this recipe many times since 1990 and it's a great cocktail party recipe if you don't mind frying food in the last minutes. I use food processor to make the shrimp paste the night before, then assemble the rest. I even freeze prepared, breadded and cut toast to be fried later.

I've made this dish several times and I think it's delicious! Yes, it does take longer than the recipe states but I think it is worth it. It tastes a lot better than anything you'll find at the local chinese restaurants. You actually taste the shrimp!

This taste great! However, I am an accomplished cook, however, this recipe takes longer than 45 minutes. Be prepared and allow enough time. This dish does not taste good cold. Have a batch prepared when your guest walt through the door.
