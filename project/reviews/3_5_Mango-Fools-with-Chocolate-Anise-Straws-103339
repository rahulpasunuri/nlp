I made this some time ago and served it in baked puff pastry cups, with melted dark chocolate drizzled in the bottom of the cups before adding the Fool. Make sure you chill it again before serving. Stick a chocolate straw in the side for garnish. Wonderful!

This is a very light tasting and refreshing summer dessert. I think the key is ripe mangoes. Definately DO NOT USE COOL WHIP. I put mine in juice glasses and put them in the freezer for just about 10 minutes before serving. Delicious!

Perhaps I should have added more sugar, but this was too tart-not very enjoyable. I served it with meringue shells, drizzled a little melted chocolate in each one first. Used Trader Joe's frozen mango as there were no ripe mangoes or canned mangoes in the store when I was shopping. It was OK, but everyone liked the rum cake I made much more, and no one went back for seconds.

I've been looking for this kind of recipe for a while after I had a similar dessert (she used strawberry) at a friend's house. I love the texture of this. Don't have whole cream here in Hong Kong so used whipping cream instead and still came out perfect.

Good and light. I changed the presentation of this all up. I put the mango fool in a puff pastry and layed bittersweet chocolate on the bottom and drizzled on top. It looked great and probably tasted better than just with the straws. The chocolate is the key to making this a better dish. I just used canned mango and it was fine.

to marie, your mango fool probably tasted like something was missing because of the cool whip substitution. for a dessert like this, you have to use real whipped cream to get the flavor. it just doesn't work otherwise.

THIS WAS THE BEST RECIPE I HAVE MADE IN MY LIFE

I made this recipe as directed with one exception. I used cool whip in place of the whipped cream. It was good but there seemed to be something missing. I froze it in 3 ounce plastic cups and served it with cool whip and some fresh fruit cut-up. It got rave reviews especially from my husband. Frozen it comes out like a sorbet. Very good!
