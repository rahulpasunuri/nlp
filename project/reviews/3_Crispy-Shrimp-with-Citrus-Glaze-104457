The glaze was missing a little something at the end. Added a pat of butter and it was just the trick. Family loved it!

This dish is tasty, but was a little too difficult to pull off in the throes of a large dinner party. The sesame seeds fell off the shrimp and the sauce is a little too thin for my taste.

This looked so good and yet was so disappointing. The sauce did not thicken so I ended up tossing it into the pan with the shrimp and then it did thicken somewhat. I think if I did the recipe again ( which i probably won't) I would toast the sesame seeds first. Alot of them fell off the shrimp even before I tossed in the sauce. I will try to salvage what's left by serving it up over Jasmine rice. Too bad, it looked so good.

We love this. It is easy and light and flavorful. I always use fresh juices to make the most of the delicious glaze. Serve the shrimp with jasmine rice and make "tacos" with chilled whole butter lettuce leaves. Even my husband who has been a Pacific Rim/Seafood chef for over 20 years LOVES this dish. I highly recommend!

Fantastic, everyone in my family loved it! I added a little bit more hot sauce because we like it hot. I would highly recommend this recipe!

This is a great tasting dish. Very difficult getting the sesame seeds to stick weell, and teh glaze is more of a dressing....we lost a carpet to drippings on the way to the table...better to serve in a broad bowl as thickening teh glaze ( second time) ruined the flavor.

I loved it but i like shrimp and sesame seeds. I only used orange juice and had to add quite a bit of cream of tartar to thicken up the glaze but it wound up tasting like chinese Duck sauce, which i love. I think I will have to make this one again

wonderful citrus glaze, would recommend sprinkling the sesame seeds on rather then dipping.

This recipe was fantastic. I used a 100% fruit juice mixture in place of the mandarin juice and it was delicious. I've currently got extra sauce made up for the next time I make these wonderful shrimp.

I was disappointed by this recipe as I love shrimp and citrus fruits. I found the glaze rather bitter, though it was better when used as a dipping sauce rather than poured over the shrimp and salad. Since I don't like iceberg lettuce I substituted mesclun.

The sesame seeds were way too much this was disappointing. Too bad - looked good though

Another definite winner from bon appetite. served it during the holidays when everyone is tired of chilled shrimp and more chilled shrimp. we all loved the crispy texture and tangy sause. i made it a day ahead and i think that helps it thicken. i also had to cook it longer to get it thicker when i first made it--be patient!

This was a big disappointment -- the sesame seeds and the glaze completely overpowered the taste of the shrimp. The glaze was unpleasant.

I would definitely make the shrimp again. I will never make the sauce again! I had no trouble thickening the sauce but it had a bite which myself and my husband did not care for. I tried to adjust for that by making a second batch of sauce & eliminating the grapefruit juice. I could not get rid of the bite and in the end threw out the sauce altogether. I made a pineapple & tangerine sauce instead which worked quite nice with the shrimp.

I made this appetizer for Christmas dinner and was enjoyed by all. The glaze however did not thicken and I used a little bit of cornstarch. This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely make it again.

I added less hot sauce because we are not spicy people! My husband loved this and he is my favorite critic ..on the second batch, I left them cooking till the seeds got very brown and toasty ... I turned over for a half a minute only and it was even better! I cooked the citrus sauce longer and it became very tart and wonderful... the sauce does not have to be extra thck as the other people asked .. it is supposed to be subtle.. .. just drizzle more on ..I love this receipe

I love it, and plan to make it for my pre-christmas dinner, i would like to add if the syrup does not come out thick add a little cornstarch.

The shrimp was pretty good, however the glaze never became "slightly syrupy." I would like to try it again, but would prefer the glaze to be thicker. Any suggestions?
