I been making this spice mix forever, although I too, cut the salt measument in half. I sprinkle this on everything from corn on the cob to grilled shrimp to chicken and even scrambled eggs!

I use this all the time (but I only use 1/2 of the salt called for in the recipe) - mostly on fish, but I also rubbed it on chicken wings, let them sit for awhile, then broiled and brushed with a spicy BBQ sauce. BEST chix wings I've ever had!!

I used this to spice up my crawfish cheesecake, a version of Jaquimo's (famous New Orleans' restaurant) recipe for alligator cheesecake. It was fabulous! Great for any Cajun dish!!!

This, and the one from Mr. B's, and the one from Emeril, are all very similar -- but none of them taks into account the vast number of people dying from stroke, and ailing with hypertension, because of TOO MUCH SALT!!
