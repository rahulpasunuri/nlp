Tuna is very good, slaw was pretty hot .... overall very good meal!

I followed only the tuna portion of this recipe (I used my own broccoli slaw recipe as a side), and I thought it was tricky to make. It may be lack of experience with searing tuna, but having followed the recipe exactly, it did not turn out well.

I made it without the Vegetable Slaw. I used the tuna as part of a simple salad with Miso & Mustard dressing.

It was very good. The dressing was excellent.

I love sesame seared tuna! The slaw did not appear to be universally loved here, so I made a quick snow pea/red bell pepper stir-fry.

I made the recipe without the vanilla and the sugar in the slaw. All the other elements came together and the result was easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I tried the slaw and it was delicious - although I didn't add the vanilla since I didn't have it. I used splenda instead of sugar and it worked fine. It was time consuming because I had to grate the vegetables by hand, plus I used 2 fairly large parsnips and carrots so I had to double the salad dressing. The seared tuna was delicious- unfortunately, I used a little too much salt. I would leave the salt out of the sesame if you're going to put it on the tuna as the recipe calls for. Also, cooking it for 2 minutes on each side is too long if you like it rare like we do. Definitely would make it again though!

Additionally, I did make the slaw. I wasn not too impressed there either. My s/o asked if I had mixed in vanilla yogurt.

Not a fan. Recipe does not specify how to cut the tuna - butterfly it? That was my guess, although it seemed counter-intuitive from most seared tuna recipes. The tuna had a bitter flavor to it - I'm wondering if the wasabi powder could spoil, as mine was not fresh. I actually had to scrape the coating and re-sear in olive oil. I then made a fresh tuna salad so as not to waste the steaks.

My husband and I enjoyed this. It was beautiful and tasty. I didn't serve the slaw because of time factor, but will try that at another time. Will serve again.

Caveat: This was the only recipe we could find for searing tuna with a sesame crust. We didn't make the slaw, but the tuna turned out fabulous. We will definitely make the tuna again and maybe try the slaw next time!

Very easily makes you a seared tuna recipe with great crust, even if youve never done it before. Slaw is kind of a pain, but tastes great.
