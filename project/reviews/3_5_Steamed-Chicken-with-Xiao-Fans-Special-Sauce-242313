I used a Breville steamer to make this recipe and used a boneless chicken breast cooked with slivered fresh ginger, a bit of salt and freshly ground pepper. I also steamed cute little vegetable dumplings and asparagus. Excellent with the sauce.

It is odd that salt is only added at the end and only to the chicken, not to the sauce. I really like steamed chicken with its subtle flavors, so I liked this recipe. I did however season the chicken before steaming and added salt to the sauce so that it wouldn't be too bland.

It was ok. The sauce had a nice flavor, but i wish i had marinated the chicken with the sauce or thickened the sauce in some way - the chicken was way too bland.

The flavor of the sauce is excellent and the flavor of the ginger-scented chicken is very simple and authentic. I used chicken thighs for a more simple preparation. Be sure to salt the chicken well after cooking. Not the most beautiful dish, but great comfort food, especially since we no longer live close to a Chinese community.
