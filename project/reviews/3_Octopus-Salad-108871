Recipe is a great salad entree. I am lucky to live in Panama where papayas and octopus are cheap and delicious. I used the small Hawiian papayas, which are firmer and often sweeter than the large papayas. I added a crunchy romaine base to the salad and in the future I would substitute a flavorless oil for the olive oil. With the Thai slant to this dish, I will probably reduce the oil to two or three tablespoons or drop it entirely. The oil does soften and meld the flavors but many salads from that part of the world contain no oil and I like the flavor mix.

I learned to cook octopus salad from a fine italian cook in brooklyn new york who insisted on fresh octopus (such a difference)and taught me to cook it with corks to reduce toughness. Be sure you choose fresh lemongrass as old grass will ruin the taste. I garnish with lemons and salt and pepper later to each persons taste. Use the best lightest olive oil you prefer and you will learn if you havent already, the joy of the octo.
