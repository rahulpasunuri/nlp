Using fresh raspberries and apples, I added 2 teaspoons of flour to thicken the juice and precooked them before adding the oatmeal mixture. The result was very good and I would indeed make it again.

Using fresh raspberries, I cooked them with the apples and added 2 teaspoons to thicken the juice. The result was excellent, the crisp was delicious and not too thick or thin.

delicious! for what it's worth, i reduced the sugar added to the fruit to 1/3 cup- and yes, i defrosted the raspberries and drained a fair bit (most!) of the liquid before adding them to the mix. i also increased the topping recipe to make a 1.5x batch, and added about 2 tbs chopped walnuts and about 1/2 cup bran flakes in addition to the oats (family tradition for crisp toppings- adds great texture). a great recipe to try- with all of your own families' traditions and additions!

We just went apple and raspberry picking and this was the perfect recipe to use with our freshly picked produce. Easy to make and delicious. The raspberries add a nice flavor to the apples and the crisp oatmeal topping is perfect.

this is a great recipe but I would suggest adding a bit of tapioca or flour to the mix - the raspberries can make this quite soupy and the starch helps make a better presentation!

Yum! Next time will add less butter and sugar. But great and easy.

The tartness of the rasberries worked very well with the sweetness of the apples, a twist on cranberry-apple combinations. However, I found the rasbery seeds to be an annoyance. The cooked rasberries did not add much to the consistency, so I think I might try pushing the rasberries through a seive first and folding in with the apples before baking.

Great recipe! I didn't use as much margarine as was called for and it still turned out delicious. Vanilla ice cream is a must!

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I do drain the raspberries after they are thawed. This is always a hit and worth making!!

this was yummy, although when i made it, the frozen fruit ended up oozing quite a lot of liquid...if you like a bit of sauce in your crumble, that's okay. otherwise i would try defrosting them (nuke quickly), squeeze gently and drain before putting it into the tin. i also used mixed frozen berries instead of just raspberries. it was a very colorful item and kept it from being too tart.

WAY too much sugar! I used only 1/3 c sugar with the fruit & 1/3 c or less for the topping. In addition, I used only 1/4 cup flour & 3/4 c oats in topping along with some chopped pecans. I added some 5-spice powder, allspice & pinch of freshly ground pepper to topping. Also sprinkled the fruit with a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. Delicious!!

Wonderful,warm,comforting and easy. Delicious with soft, sweetened whipped cream. I also added a few toasted walnuts for extra flavor. A hit with everyone in the house even the fussy teenages, and great for company.

Excellent recipe, though I made a few changes. I added walnuts to the topping (almonds would be good too) and I cooked the dish covered with foil for the first 10-15 minutes then removed it to crisp the topping.

Fabulous and easy to make! A keeper!

delicious, especially with vanilla ice cream. one concern I had, though, was that the top crisp part cooked to fast and started to burn a little before the inside was heated. next time, i'll probably cook the apple and raspberry mixture a little first before adding the top

I agree on the things said before, this will be one of my favorites

This recipe is very easy to make. Never one for baking even I could do it easily. I used frozen wild blueberries instead of the raspberries. It is a great dessert for a group and I am making it again this evening for company.

This recipe is an old stand-by for me. I've used it many times with either raspberries or blackberries and have always had great results!

This was brilliantly easy and so delicious! Am a big fan of really crunchy crisp toppings and this one hit it dead on on the nose. Yum, YUM!

A truly wonderful apple crisp recipe! The raspberries add a nice dimension and give the filling a lovely color. Only one caveat - I think this is best served the same day, preferably fresh from the oven or at room temp, when the topping is nice and crisp. I made mine a day before and it is difficult to reheat without softening the topping. Still delicious, though!

Absolutely terrific! And soooo easy to make... I also used 7 apples and not quite twice the amount of topping. I added another 1/2 cup of raspberries to compensate for the additional crumble. It was perfect!

I made this for my bookclub and it got rave reviews. I also made this with 7 apples and increased the topping to 1.5 times. Delicious (and easy)!!

I enjoyed this recipe on a cold November evening it was delightful. My family prefers a less sweet crist so I omitted the sugar from the apple mixture and left it at 1/3 of a cup mixed with the topping. I also substituted clove powder for the cinnamon. It is a family favorite.

This is a great fall dessert. Like the other cook, I increased the butter to one stick. It went great with spiced cider. I will serve it again for sure!

I loved this dessert! It's easy to do and you can make it ahead. I followed some of the earlier reviews, used 7 apples and doubled the topping ingredients. Excellent.

Delicious and easy to make recipe. Would definitely make this recipe again. Next time I would increase the amount of apples I used.

It seems that everyone is having fun modifying this recipe and I did the same. I served this dish as the dessert course of a dinner buffet that I hosted and everyone loved it. It's the perfect fall dessert. My changes included adding about a 1/4 cup of white sugar to cut the tartness and adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and orange zest to add zing to the apples. I also used 7 apples so I increased all of the ingredients for the topping by 50%. To make sure the fruit gets juicy enough, just let it sit for an extra bit to let the sugar do its trick.

A really nice and easy crisp. I used 1 stick of margarine. I enjoyed this desert and will make again.

This is a good basic recipe to play around with. I wanted to use ingredients that I had on hand without going out and buying stuff, so I tried a few substitutions. Instead of the apples, I used rhubarb. Both the rhubarb and the raspberries were from the garden and I had frozen them, so I did have to defrost them in the microwave somewhat just to break them up. Also, I had only 1/2 cup golden brown sugar, so I used another 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. This dish was delicious. The crust was a deep golden brown. Yes, it was tart, but vanilla ice cream balances it out perfectly Also, mine was not dry at all. In fact, it may have been a little too juicy because it didn't hold it's shape when I sliced it. I think the frozen fruit (which I did not drain) added the juice. No one seemed to care though--they it too fast to realize there weren't perfectly formed pieces.

I used this recipe for a dinner party where some people had food allergies. It was a great hit! It was a little to tart for my taste, however, and next time I used a combination of apples. I also increased the amount of butter to 1 stick.

Very nice recipe, went over big in our house. I think you are wrong, if you read further down in the recipe it does tell you to add (frozen) raspberries not thawed.

Rating: 3
A nice crisp. By the way, the word unthawed is not correct. A frozen item melted is thawed, hence use thawed raspberries.........

Good flavor for autumn. However, the crisp part was very dry, maybe needs more butter or less flour.

This is a very nice, easy recipe. We used this this week as a dessert in our restaurant--with very good results. Only problem is there is a wierd symbol in the recipe regarding an amount of flour. We just took a guess!

Very Good. Great for the Fall.
