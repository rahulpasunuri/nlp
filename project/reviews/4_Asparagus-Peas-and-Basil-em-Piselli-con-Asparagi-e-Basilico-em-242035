I made this recipe for a very foodie crowd at Easter and everyone loved it!! I wouldn't change a thing!My brother suggested serving the veggies with orecchiette and a little parmasean. Yum

I was looking forward to making this as a side dish due to all the great reviews. Unfortunately, this dish was pretty blah to me, I didn't feel that it was anything special and I felt the basil didn't really go with the other ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly as directed, using the frozen peas, but wasn't satisfied with the result. Roasting the asparagus in the oven with a little EVOO, salt and pepper and a little parmesan at the end tastes 100 times better, in my opinion. Not sure why, but I was not a fan at all.

I have made this dish several times and we love it, it's delicious and so easy! I have made this dish for a couple of dinner parties and have received rave reviews. I am taking it to a potluck tomorrow to serve 16. Adding the basil at the end smells heavenily. This is a keeper!

I hate to be the downer after all the positive reviews, but I didn't think this dish was worthy of all the praise. It was certainly fine, and my family ate it gone, but I didn't think it was standout by any means. I was sad that I used my aspargus for this recipe. :(

Such an easy recipe for such great results! Served with Porchetta-style Pork Roast. Prepped all ingredients to even melting the butter first with the shallot. While the pork was resting I was able to cook the aspargus and peas and all ready to go at the same time!

This was a great, light recipe. The flavor of the asparagus is muted a little, but it does blend nicely with the peas and basil. Leftovers were great over brown rice.

Good, and very interesting flavor combination. Not mind blowing, though. I would cut some of the butter. This calls for an awful lot, and I'm not sure how much it enhanced the dish.

This recipe was delicious. Followed the recipe exactly, except left out the butter and used evoo (I'm lactose intolerant). The veggies tasted great and everyone gave rave reviews- no leftovers.

I used slightly less asparagus (my CSA box only had about one pound). Frozen peas worked just fine. The basil really makes this dish shine (I used 2 types for more depth, but in the end it would probably taste the same with one). I used a little more butter than it called for and added in pasta for a main course instead of side dish. My husband said, "this is a good way to get me to eat my vegetables."

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have any shallots so I cooked a small amount of minced garlic in the butter, then followed the recipe the rest of the way. I took the advice of previous reviewers and tossed in a little fresh mint along with the fresh basil, and it was really lovely. This is beautifully green dish, really easy, but special enough for company.

Rating: 4
This is just the kind of recipe I love- uses common ingredients to create an uncommon dish. And once you've made it, you don't need the recipe. I made it at work for a potluck and it was totally gone. I added a little fresh mint. I made it again without so much butter and it wasn't quite so scrumptious. Definitely better with butter.

This is an awesome recipe, and I agree with others that it's lovely any time of year. It's spring, so I added a few sprigs of fresh mint heaven. I've also made this with olive oil and just a pad of butter and its still quite nice.

I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it, but I have to say the real rave reviews came when I tossed the leftovers into a frittata (with chopped vine-ripened tomatos and leftover pasta) the next morning. Spring has Sprung!

I followed the recipe exactly; definitely must use the butter-just cut down on tomorrow's meal.The taste was so good and the fresh basil was icing on the cake. I had left over shaved parmesan from a few nights before and we sprinkled this over our servings. It was great. Definitely will make again.

Wonderful summer dish. Made for a dinner party of 6 people and had massive amounts of leftovers! At least enough for another 6 people. Only used half the dressing and was plenty. Wonderful flavors and although a little labor intensive, well worth it!

This was fantastic. A little pricey for a side dish (at least on a student's budget), but the fresh basil and shallots were amazing with the other vegetables. I used a little less butter (about 2 tablespoons) and it turned out great.

This recipe is a fantastic solution to what to do with asparagus, which I don't really like just by itself. The sweetness of the peas and basil goes very well with the asparagus. Also it's super easy and quick. It's great as a meal with just some brown rice on the side.

Okay. so... I was actually a little worried about making this dish. There were a few negative reviews so I was a little cautious. THIS WAS AMAZING!! I did add some fresh grated parmesan cheese at the end but the asparagus was crisp and fresh! It tasted of spring time! My family loved it! I am not one for asparagus but it is my new found love! I would have never guessed that peas and asparagus would have gone together so well! This was absolutely fabulous! A must try dish!

I liked this recipe a lot. I had never used fresh peas (as opposed to frozen) before, and I didn't quite know what to do with them. I'm happy to say that they no longer scare me. I used 2tbsp of butter, and I thought it was plenty. I also doubled the shallots and probably could have even used a little more. When I had finished cooking this, it was absolutely perfect. But the I left the lid on it while everything else finished cooking, so I ended up with a mushy mess. Do NOT overcook this dish like I did!!! Overall, delicious and nutritious.

Tried this last night using frozen organic peas, fresh basil and fresh thin aspargus. Served it with a red sauced pasta puttanesca and the colors were great on the white dinner plate. I used a French Sea Salt and that brought the flavor up. The dish is great for color and okay on flavors. But sometimes you need just that.

Even though I like both these vegetables, I felt that they didn't do anything for each other. The taste wasn't bad, it was like eating some asparagus, and then some peas. They didn't especially go together. Putting them in the same dish detracted somewhat from each of them. The preparation with shallots and butter was nice. I also felt that the basil flavor did nothing for either vegetable and was a distraction. There was certainly no whole that was more than the sum of any of these parts. In addition the dish was just way too green and didn't look especially nice when it was served. No one in my family liked it, though we did eat it because it wasn't terrible.

Forgot to mention in my review, I used 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter to add some good fats to the bad. I also used more veggies (by weight) than called for. Otherwise, agree with others that you can probably get by with less butter/oil.

What a wonderful combination. I've come to asparagus late in life, having been served the mushy stuff in a can as a child. I now appreciate it fresh, and in this recipe, it's just outstanding. Will be making this repeatedly from now on!

Oh god that was good. I substituted edamame for the peas, and added a couple gloves of minced garlic and red pepper flakes for some kick. It's supposed to be a side dish, but I filled my plate with a great heap of the green melange, and ate it up with a few slices of an artisan loaf of rosemary-olive oil bread on the side. And red wine, of course. And some brandy-soaked blue cheese. I think I can die happy. Right.Now.

This was very nice. I added crisp- steamed cauliflower florets and used whole pea pods instead of shelled peas. I sauteed the pea pods quickly over high heat and added them at the end. Also, I used my own garden pesto (frozen from last year's harvest) instead of fresh basil. I stirred it in last. A very unique and enjoyable veggie course.

Absolutely yummy! I made this for my mother- in-law's 70th birthday and it was a huge hit. The fresh basil makes all the difference, so forget the recipe unless you have some. Also, I used frozen peas and it was still fantastic. Can only imagine fresh peas would take it over the top! I'm very glad to have a new great way to serve asparagus; we were in an asparagus and mayonnaise rut...try this recipe!

Very easy (made on a weeknight). The shallots definitely add to this recipe, so do not omit! The end product had sweetness and almost creamy texture. Added parsley in with basil and was great. Would try it with fresh shelled peas next time, only to see if there was any difference.
