Sometimes the simplest and time-tested are the classics! This was a return to lamb as it should be -a star on its own. Perfection.

Because it was one of my first times to prepare lamb, I wanted to start with something simple...but what I found was rich copiious flavors. I used more of the recommended garlic cut into larger chunks. In addition, with the salt and pepper, I added garlic powder. Big hit with my guests.....I only with I would have made a spicy yogurt dressing to accompany the dish.
