I loved it. Easy to make. I used a zuchiini which I cut into 1 inch thick sections then halved. Need to like smokey flavor to like the dish.

This is really a great summer dish. However, after I made the glaze, I felt it was lacking a depth of flavor, so I added a bit more salt, a pinch of sugar and about 2 teaspoons or so of ancho chili powder. I believe these additions made a good glaze great. Used this on scallops as well. And I used a grill pan instead of skewers for 2 reasons: 1) it's easier; 2) if you were to cook the shrimp for 8 minutes, they'd be way overdone. By using the grill pan, we put the veggies on first, then the sausage, followed with the scallops, and lastly the shrimp which only take a couple of minutes to cook. With these changes I would give it 4 stars, but as written, I'm sticking with 3. Oh, and we served with corn on the cob and steamed artichokes.

Disappointed, as we usually love any "4 fork" recipe. The flavors (especially the smokiness of the paprika) are excellent, but the "glaze" is based on 3/4 cup of oil, which makes it WAY too rich and oily. Will probably try it again, and cut down the oil to a minimum so it is more of a paste.

Quick-cooking, lots of flavor. Great for a weeknight meal. Served with cous cous. Will definitely make it again.

Can't go wrong with smoked paprika. I served it with a simple salad with a yogurt cumin feta dressing and a fruit salad with minted sugar (from this site). Finished off with basil ice cream. Nice summer dinner.

This was delicious, easy to make, quick: a great weeknight dinner; would also work for a casual dinner party. I used Aidells fully-cooked chicken Italian sausage, which worked perfectly. I had leftover zucchini and added chunks of that. This was okay, not something to seek out regularly. Smoked paprika is a must; the smoky flavor, mixed with spicy, is key to the dish

I used the glaze as a marinade and poured over the shrimp plus vegetables of my choice (red onions, red bell pepper, and baby red potatoes cut up) in a bowl, stirred it a little, and then put it all in a grill basket and closed the lid of the grill. Turned out great with a good flavor! I served over couscous, and it was all terrific. I didn't add a fork rating because I changed the recipe so much.

Rating: 4
Great flavorful recipe. I did thread each ingredient individually so I could be sure they cooked properly, and I didn't have the tomato or onion so I used chunks of zucchini instead (went great with the other ingredients, actually!). I'm not normally a big fan of shrimp but these really had some zing. The sauce was tangy, spicy, and smoky. Definitely will make again.

This is our go to recipe for a quick date night meal. It's easy, full of flavor and delicious. Make sure to choose a good quality shrimp and sausage for this meal. The selection of sausage can make or break this meal.

I love this recipe. I simplify it and just skewer the shrimp and sausage and serve it as an app. I am getting ready to prepare it for 250 people and it is a sure hit!

Rating: 4
This dish is exceptional! I served it to an executive chef who proclaimed that it made his mouth happy. Everyone at the table agreed. We do like spicy.... I used extra-large shrimp and 6 minutes was about right. Served with brown and wild rice and grilled zucchini, it was quite beautiful on the plate as well.

Rating: 3
Watch your shrimp-unless they are very large, 6-8 min is too long.

Rating: 4
A great dish with very tasty sauce. I usually use half the recommended crushed red pepper to make it less spicy. Otherwise this recipe is delicious.

This was great! The sauce is fantastic!

Rating: 4
Loved it!! Easy for dinner or great as a party appetizer, too. I had guests that are sensitive to spicy: so, after grilling, as a sort of dipping sauce, I made the smoky paprika glaze and substituted creme fraiche (I'm sure sour cream would work) for the olive oil. It's still got a great flavor, but much "cooler". All in all, a keeper.

Rating: 3
I used sweet Hungarian paprika since it is the kind I swear by, and this came out delicious. I also added a little bit of oregano to the glaze for some extra herb flavor. This was a super easy, delicious, and pretty healthy meal since I left out the sausage (only because I did not have any!)

Rating: 3
We made this with fresh sausages grilled separately from the shrimp skewers...nice results, a nice smokey flavor. A fast and easy week night dinner to put together, too. We didn't think it was spicy enough, so next time I'd add more red pepper.

I've made this twice -- nice and easy recipe that everyone enjoys. The glaze is delicious and other than cleaning shrimp, this really couldn't be easier or quicker.

Absolutely excellent. The smoked paprika makes this dish and is a must. I pair it with cilantro rice and it's a wonderful meal.

Good but not great. Easy.

Truly excellent. We put it all on while cooking and it came out perfectly. Maybe best skewers ever.

I have had far better shrimp dishes...this just didn't make it for me.

These were really easy and really great. I did them on small skewers and served them as appetizers (one piece each of shrimp, sausage, tomato, and onion). Gone in 30 seconds!

I made this as the main course for a casual dinner party, and everyone was extremely impressed. I can't tell you how many people asked me what kind of sausage or shrimp or glaze I used. I was super busy at work that week, so I actually made the glaze the day before. I covered it (pressed the glaze against the plastic wrap) and refrigerated it (brought to room temp before serving), and it was great. I really appreciated the reviewer's suggestion to segregate the components (tomatoes, onion, shrimp, sausage) on the skewers and only later add them collectively to the platter. Start the shrimp skewers about 5 minutes later than everything else, and turn often.

Rating: 4
This was totally outstanding. I did not make any changes the to receipe. We are having it again this week when out kids come down.

Rating: 4
This glaze is fabulous. I was looking for something different to do with shrimp tonight, but didn't have sausage. Can't wait to try it with the remaining ingredients. A great place to get smoked paprika is the Atlantic Spice Company which can be found on the internet (my go-to place to buy spices cheap.) So easy, I'll definately make this one of our favorite BBQ recipes.

We made the recipe as stated, and it was fabulous. Would absolutely make this again!

We subbed hot Italian Sausage for the smoked sausage (pre-cooked first on the grill). It was delicious, quick and easy. Will make often this summer. May replace my go to recipe for shrimp skewers...

Rating: 4
Yum-ola! Subbed in chorizo and used multicolor cherry tomatoes and it was absolutely delicious. No leftovers. Definitely worth the added effort of finding the smoked paprika and so easy. Can even make it under the broiler. A summer must!

I have served this twice in the last week, and everyone loves it. The sauce is the BOMB!

Rating: 4
Four stars for the simplicity of the recipe - very easy to put together last minute. Love the smokey flavor. For the reviewer who had problem with overcooked shrimp I thread the shrimp, sausage and vegetables separately and then remove from grill when ready. Remove from skewers to platter. I also divide the marinade and marinate the shrimp for a few minutes before putting on the grill. Halved the marinade and had just enough.

Rating: 4
Oh! This marinade is so wonderful....of course it's the first time I've been introduced to the smoked paprika but now I will look for more recipes with this incredible spice. Made as directed and added button mushrooms to the kabobs. Also made with the saffron/butter rice....it's popular for a reason. In-laws loved it.

Made this for dinner the other night and was diappointed, the sausage flavor completely overwhelmed the delicate shrimp. The shrimp were also way over-cooked. I liked the idea, though and would try again with some slight moderations.

Saw this on the cover of BA and knew I would be adding it to my rotation for sure. I left off the veggies and opted instead to pair it with gazpacho - - made me feel like I was in Barcelona. I also used chicken sausage from Trader Joe's for a lighter touch. We brought it on a picnic and gobbled every skewer up.

Rating: 4
This dish is awesome! Seriously finger-licking good. I had turkey and chicken sausage on hand but clearly the clincher of this recipe is the smoky paprika - make sure you use the good stuff. Paired it with the cilantro ginger rice also of BA June 2010.

Rating: 4
We loved this recipe. Outstanding flavors. Made it exactly as called for but used turkey sausage in place of the andouille. I also brushed the glaze on a couple of hours before I grilled it. We had about half the sauce left over which I will definately use again. This whole issue is packed with flavor.

I made this recipe with ingredients as stated. I increased the number of shrimp per person from 2 to 4. While I prepared the rest of dinner, I marinated the shrimp, onions, and cherry tomatoes in the glaze. I served this with saffron rice(recipe from this site), corn-on-the-cob, a basil-dressed salad, and berries with limoncello cream (from this site) to rave reviews.

Made as the recipe stated. Delicious and really easy.

Made exactly as written to rave reviews - including a 10 yr. old. Served with Spanish red beans and rice with bacon and green onions; and baked pepper halves stuffed with grape tomatoes, basil, herbs, onions and goat cheese. Good Spanish sangria to wash it down didn't hurt one bit. Keeper.

Rating: 4
Fabulous recipe with bright fresh flavors. I used Spanish Paprika and I'm not sure its the same as the smoked, so next time I will look for the smoked. Laughing because after reading reviews, I realized I had omitted the crushed red pepper! Oh well...it was still delicious without it. Love the idea of serving with saffron rice.

Rating: 4
Love it when easy and wonderful go hand in hand. I used jumbo grilling shrimp and ommitted the thyme, because I was just too lazy to walk out to the garden. Still perfect.

Rating: 4
These were great. I used only 1/2 lb of sausage and sliced it thin. We could get a bite with all 4 ingredients together. Yum!!! I only needed 1/2 of the marinade and it served 3.

Made exactly as written - delicious, easy, and fast. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will add another tsp. of sherry vinegar - just a personal preference. Served over rice - lovely presentation.

Rating: 4
Super easy to prepare, quick on the grill and looks excellent on a plate. Flavor is wonderful too. I didn't find to glaze too spicy at all, but we like it hot. I used regular Smoked Sausage and Hungarian Hot Paprika (had both on hand). I marinated the shrimp in some of the glaze in a plastic bag for about 1 hour as well as brushing on while grilling. Served with saffron rice and sauteed zucchini/red bell pepper - Colorful! Will definetly make again soon.

Rating: 4
Great flavor, super-simple and quick to make. I searched for smoked paprika and I'm glad I did - it adds a wonderful smoky sausage flavor to the glaze. I cut the cayenne in half and it was perfect - just enough heat but not too overwhelming. I could only find uncooked andouille sausage, so I boiled it for just a few minutes first, to partially cook it, and then finished on the grill. Absolutely delicious with grilled pita and fresh fruit!

Rating: 4
What more can I add? Couldn't find sherry vinegar, used red wine vinegar. Also used dried thyme instead of fresh. Turkey smoked sausage instead of andouille. Not my preference, just dealing with what my local store had. Still delish. Since I made for just two of us, had some leftovers, so, I got to try a day or two later and even more delish! When I make this again, I think I will make the glaze ahead of time to let all those flavors come together!

Rating: 4
Excellent. Used andouille turkey sausage from Trader Joe's. Served as an appetizer for a Memorial Day grill-athon and guests devoured it. Followed the recipe as written. Used the sauce generously before and during grilling; however, the guests were uninterested in using the sauce for dipping.

Rating: 4
We made this last nite switching out Kielbasa for the shrimp (partially pre-grilling the Kielbasa whole then slicing it and placing it on the skewers) - the recipe is delicious!! Definitely enhanced by drizzling the remaining glaze over the cooked skewers..definetely a keeper - can't wait to make again!

Rating: 4
Very Good. I used balsamic vinegar, and small red onions (baked before hand with salt, pepper & olive oil) wrapped shrimp around the sausage and onions. Plated nicely. Great recipe will make again.

Rating: 4
SO GOOD!!! I'd say the sauce on the side had more of a kick rather than being "spicy." Just my opinion. Absolutely delish and easy to make. Would def make again. Served with israeli couscous with snap peas and asparagus (recipe found on this site) and a mixed greens salad. Received rave reviews.

This recipe was really delicious . It was very quick and easy to prepare . My family loved it , but the sauce on the side was too hot for some . I will definetly make this again .
