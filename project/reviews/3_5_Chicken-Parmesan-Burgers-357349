Fast, super tasty ,weekday dinner. I added garlic to the patty and increased the amount of basil in the sauce and breading mixture.I topped as described, plus added a roasted red pepper. Delioush. Will definitely make agan, but I'll use a kaiser or chiabatta bun - the sauce was seeping through the french bread.

Taking others advice, I put two large garlic cloves and 4 tablespoons of italian seasoning (the herb parmesan mix in those herb-oil bread dip mixes) into the bread crumb mixture. That turned out beautifully!! I also skipped the radicchio as others suggested and replaced it with arugula, which again turned out well. The whole family loved this recipe and we'll definitely be making this a regular dinner around our house.

Taking some previous suggestions, I added 3 small'ish cloves garlic and sprinkled some adobo - thought the flavor was very good. Used ciabatta bread and really liked this, too. Thought radicchio added nice texture and I liked balance of bitter flavor. My husband and daughter (middle schooler) loved this dinner, so will definitely make again and will add red pepper flakes to give little more kick.

really bland. the chicken patty needed more flavor, and I ever added a few other thing like garlic.

Wow. I was skeptical but tried and loved. Radicchio isnt my favorite and the bitter taste did not compliment although it looked pretty. We used panko crumbs and even the kids ate this one. Keeper.

Was ok. I feel like I could have just cooked a chicken breast and would have been less messy. I used adobo seasoning and garlic in the chicken mixture. Loved the idea of using fresh basil. Is it just me because I don't get the radicchio. Not my thing.

I made these for diner tonight. They were good, but I'd bump up the flavor of the chicken patties a bit, maybe with some fresh garlic as others have mentioned, or maybe a pinch of red pepper flakes. I don't like radicchio so I subbed spinach. Definitely a keeper....Served with Roasted Red Pepper Soup. Great meal!

These were pretty good and they get extra points for being super easy. I added garlic because I add garlic to everything. Didn't have fresh basil so I used dried but I'm sure it would have been improved with a bunch of fresh basil. Not bad for an easy dinner!

Great! I added bread crumbs, 1/4 c parmesan cheese and a clove of crushed garlic to the chx mixture and used provolone instead of mozzarella and instead of radicchio I used a spinich, baby spring and herb mix. Served with Alexia garlic and onion crinkle cut fries with marinara instead of ketchup. Kids loved it!

This was ok. I think it needs a little punch of something. Next time I will add a little honey mustard to the burgers.

Very good! Giving it the 4th fork b/c it was incredibly easy, quick and pretty healthy as well. I used my own sauce instead of bottled, and as another reviewer suggested subbed provolone for the mozzarella.

I agree that these were good! A great, quick meal and it was done in half an hour. I too added a heaping tablespoon of garlic to mixture as well as extra basil. Tossed some extra parm and bread crumbs in the mix too so that it didn't seem too gloppy as other reviewers found and it made for a sturdier patty. Served on toasted buns! We enjoyed and didn't find it gloppy as some others did.

Always very good. I omit the oil in the burger and I also add some parmesan into the burger mix. I also add a little fresh garlic as it is missing. I sometime serve over marinara instead of on bread and it is a keeper! Easy and delicious. Served with parmesan noodles and sauteed fresh corn cut off the cob yum!

I used ground turkey breast instead of chicken, whole wheat burger buns instead of french bread, and added fresh garlic to the sauce. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and we loved these burgers! For those having trouble with the fact that ground chicken, or turkey, is very sticky and doesn't "form patties", lightly moistening your hands with water before scooping and forming each patty makes things much easier and neater. Drop each patty right into the plate of crumbs and pack crumbs into both sides. These are very tasty!

Dude, they were amazing! I am soooo going in for seconds. Instead of basil i used mixed, dried, tuscan herbs. It was so good I will do this again!

These have great flavor, we really enjoyed them. I did not use French Bread, I used more of a crusty chiabata type and only used the bottom to cut down some of the carbs. The ground chicken I found came in a 16 oz package so I used the entire thing and just increased some of the flavor measurements accordingly. I still made 4 patties. Really good cold the next day over salad!

Wow! Looks like I am in the minority here, but I couldn't even get past the goopy, sloppy mess trying to make burgers out of the ground chicken. It was like trying to work with paste. Just gross. The "patties" are amorphous blobs, and who knows how I am going to cook them? They are actually much closer to liquid than solid, so you cannot 'shape' any patties! Terrible. Haven't even tasted them, 'cause I can't even cook 'em. Blyuch!!!

Loved it! The fresh basil makes all the difference! Even my picky hubby gobbled it up!

To be honest, it wasn't that great. The meat was mushy and not flavorful enough. Bread was too dry and required too much sauce to be palatable. I'd rather eat a veggie burger. Will make this again, but will probably work more basil into the burger, possibly something with more "bite" as well - and either use smaller patties or find some other way to improve the texture.

This was easy to prepare and great to eat. Believe it or not, I couldn't find fresh Basil and was out of dried basil so I used Italian seasonings which worked out great. Also, I couldn't find whole milk mozz so used part skim mozz and it tasted great! I also made them on a mini baquet which is perfect for appetizers!

Easy and delicious. This recipe will be added to our cooking rotation.

I wasn't expecting much from chicken burgers, but wanted to eat a little healthy. These were delicious. For the next day's leftovers, I served the burgers over a white bean/tomato/basil salad.

I used ground turkey for mine. It was AWESOME...my entire family (including kids) loved it!

Absolutely delicious. I was super hungry and I had these ingredients at home. It was delicious! Good job.

This was wonderful. I took the idea from an earlier review, baked it at 375 for 25 minutes and came out wonderfully and not oily at all. Can't wait to make it again. Next time would not use french bread but hamburger rolls.

This reminded me of meatloaf. I followed the recipe exactly. It was ok. I would not make it again.

I rated it 4 forks because my kids and husband loved it. It is an easy, inexpensive way to make chicken parm. Some of my family ate it on a nice roll and others just ate it on the plate-no bread. I used dried basil as I didn't have the fresh on hand and I just sprinkled the burgers with some shredded mozzarella that I had. I am sure it would be even better with the right ingredients.

This is definitely going in the rotation...easy and delicious! I added a thin layer of sun dried tomato mayo and used homemade marinara sauce; it was wonderful. Next time I will also add a few T of breadcrumb mixture to the chicken - it could've used it. In any case, it was super yummy...and my husband (the chef) loved it!

Quick and excellent! I did have to add a couple of tablespoons of the breadcrumb mixture to the chicken to give it more 'shape' and served in crusty bread rolls for convenience. Really tasty week night dinner!

This was delicious....i did everything as they said except (of course) i used sharp provolone instead of mozzarella - it just has so much more flavor. also, if you can find it, i cant recommend it highly enough, 'giacommo arrabbiata' jarred pasta sauce by one of the drago brothers (of the Los angeles restaurant empire). they have it at whole foods (at least at the sherman oaks location) - its fantastic for a jarred sauce....

I wasn't paying attention when I made this, and added the parmesan cheese and bread crumbs right to the meat to make the patties. I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste instead of the marinara sauce. They still turned out tasty. Quick,easy and a nice alternative to beef burgers. Liked it!

I made these for my husband and me for dinner tonight. I substituted a well toasted english muffin, romaine lettuce and some Italian tomato gravy I had already made. It was absolutely delicious.

A quick and delicious take on the real chicken Parmesan. I didn't want to drag out my food processor to make fresh bread crumbs so used a mini processor to grind the cheese then added panko. And instead of adding the chopped basil to the bread crumb mix, I added it directly to the meat mixture. Otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out great.

Delicious! I baked the chix burgers instead of frying -- about 25 minutes at 375F. Then topped with marinara sauce and cheese and finished under the broiler until melted and bubbly. Also delicious served over pasta. Definitely a keeper.
