These rolls were easy to make, although the shaping does take a little time. Substituted Red River Cereal for the bulgur - other than that followed the recipe. I thought they were a little salty, even the ones that didn't have the sea salt topping. I can see topping the next batch with nigella seeds for a nice colour contrast.

Probably my favorite rolls recipe of all time. Nutty, sweet, salty - they're fantastic!

These rolls were just Okay, but not worth the effort. They tasted dry and flat. I called 7 stores (grocery, health food, specialty cooking) and could not locate the flaky sea salt. The only place that I could find it was on-line. As a result I just used regular sea salt. I would not make these again.

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving last year and plan on making them again this year. I did some with pink flaked sea salt and some with black. The rolls have great texture and taste. These yummy rolls are worth the time!

Outstanding rolls! I did not have 5-6 hours, yet it still turned out beautifully. I followed the recipe exactly but for the first rising, I proofed my steam oven to 100 degrees, then turned it off and put the dough inside. I let it rise for an hour (in which time it was doubled). Then I only had time to let it rise a second time for about 20 min before baking them on Silpat sheets at the recommended temperature. They came out gorgeously! Light, fluffy, great flavor and the sea salt made a big difference. I'm not saying that you shouldn't follow the recipe, but if you neglected to read the prep time (as I did), all is not lost!

These were unbelievably easy and probably one of the best rolls I've ever made. I sprinkled with hawaiian black salt;looked liked poppy seeds. I only raised and baked half the recipe since it says they're best the same day. Froze the other half for easy rolls on another day.

I made these with my mom and they were delicious, we used maldon salt and made a few without salt. They were extremely tasty, though rather time consuming to make.

Great recipe, however I would have enjoyed it more as a loaf.

These rolls were really tasty, and although time-consuming, not at all difficult to make. I loved the earthiness of the wheat in an otherwise very light roll. We had a hard time waiting for them to cool off enough to eat them--they smelled divine!

I saw these yummy rolls on Gourmet's cover while taking the magazine out of the post office box and went straight home and fixed a batch. They are delicious, as you might expect given that they have a whole stick of butter in them. Forming them into the knot shape is fun too. The cracked wheat and whole wheat flour are healthful, but the sea salt sprinkled on top makes them irresistible to all.
