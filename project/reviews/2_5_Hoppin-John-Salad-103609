This is one of my favorite summer salads! I take it to at least one gathering every summer and people love it. Once I made it for New Year's Day for luck. I was so surprised to read some of the reviews that I had to enter my own. I always use canned peas for a shortcut, but I can't imagine that making a difference! Delicious!

Looks like those folks in CA don't much care for peas and rice :) Very popular dish with my Canadian (the other CA) friends. I'm making it yet again, by request, this weekend. Albeit, they like canned peas which have a firmer texture.

This is the WORST version of Hoppin John Salad I have ever tried! Someone please post an alternative recipe!

Had originally gotten this from magazine subscription. Have made this several times. Particularly good with smoked bar-b-que pork. Entered in a "Cook Off/Show Off" contest at work. Was extremely well received. Many requests for receipe.

This is by far the best dish we served at our Class Barbeque! All enjoyed it!
