@the Cook from KL, Malaysia: You must not be Vietnamese. I am, and the Vietnamese dipping sauce is NEVER made with vinegar. Lime or lemon only.

Perfection to go with the Crispy Spring Rolls. I was skeptical looking at the ingredients (what - no soy sauce?) but was delighted with the result. Mmmmmm. I used hot sauce instead of chilies because I didn't have them. Instead of a mortar and pestle, I used a garlic press for the garlic. Loved the garlic bits floating on the sauce that garlic lovers could spoon right into their egg roll. We saved the leftover even though the egg rolls were gone. We'll find another use - it's too good to waste!

WARNING! This recipe does not even resemble nuoc cham(vietnames dipping sauce). The sauce looks bad, smells bad, and tastes bad. I made this as my first attempt at nuoc cham and only later did I find out that the ingredients are all out of proportion. I ended up throwing this out. You have been warned.

I am currently living in Ha Noi and wanted to make dipping sauce at home like the one I have down the street. This is good but as other Viet Namese have said, use lime juice. While Viet Namese restuarants may use vinegar in the US and this is what you are used to, maybe because the quality of the limes just isn't the same. In Ha Noi vinegar is used when limes aren't as plentiful and I think , based on taste buds, it's sometimes a combination of the two.

This is tasty but the garlic should be crushed very fine, not sliced. This way you don't bite into a chunk of garlic. The brand of fish sauce you use determines how much you use. Some brands have more sodium, thus making it more salty. Start with 3 tbsp, then adjust according to taste. I tend to like lime, better than vinegar because vinegar gives it a different smell and taste, not a fresh citrus smell like lime. I use lime when the sauce is used as a dipping sauce and vinegar for dressing, like for banh cuon or rice noodles. I also use the chili garlic sauce sometimes, but the fresh chilies will give it a fresher taste & smell.

This version is a little bit more pungent than my mom's (she's from Vietnam), but it's very authentic and tastes great. As for the acidic element, I think most Vietnamese people just use whatever acid they happen to have in stock. It's like asking a French person how to make authentic bouillabaisse - 100 people will come up with 100 different recipes and ingredients. Lime, lemon, and vinegar all will produce slightly different results, but nonetheless tasty and authentic.

I'm a huge fan of Mai Pham and have two of her books. This is NOT the recipe for dipping sauce that appears in the book cited - the proportions are off. As published, it is: 2 small cloves garlic sliced; 1 tsp ground chili paste; 1 choppeed Thai bird chili; 1/4 cup fish sauce; 2/3 cup hot water; 2 tbsp lime juice with pulp; 1/4 cup sugar; 2 tbsp shredded carrots. This is how I've made it, and it is authentic. One should also use light brown sugar or palm sugar - not the white stuff.

The fish sauce ratio is too high here. You need to back it off to 4 Tbps, and then I would only make half of what you see here (so 2 Tbsp fish sauce total...) since this recipe makes way more than the average American household would need.

I disagree with piggysuz. This recipe is similar to what my Vietnamese mother uses. The lime juice gives it a more mellow, less sour flavor than vinegar. I tried making this sauce with vinegar and wondered why it did not taste the same until I asked my mother, and she said to use lime juice instead. Most Vietnamese women in my church have said that they also use lime juice instead of vinegar for the Vietnamese dipping sauce.

I'm sorry but being a huge fan of Vietnamese food I believe that authentic Vietnamese dipping sauce is made with white vinegar and not lime juice. If you use lime juice, the sauce will not taste the same as the ones you get at your favorite Vietnamese restaurant
