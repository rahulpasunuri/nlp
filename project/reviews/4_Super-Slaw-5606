I've made this twice now. First time, as written, and it was good, but over-dressed. Next time, after reading the reviews, I also subbed toasted sesame oil & chili oil, 5 Tbsp to 1, & stuck with dark brown sugar because of its sub-note, but still only used half as much dressing. Loved it. Not only was it devoured, I've given out the recipe several times. Nice twist on slaw! Made it with Asian-flavored grilled salmon.

Wow! I had to make a few changes based on my pantry: I used about 4 Tbs of chunky peanut butter (I couldn't believe I ran out of peanut butter making this...) in the dressing, napa cabbage instead of green, mini bells instead of large ones, and I skipped the carrots, green onions, and cilantro. In my opinion the last three ingredients are unnecessary. I also chopped up some peanuts to sprinkle over the slaw. I will definitely make this again, hopefully next time with creamy (and more) peanut butter.

Delicious crunchy slaw. Easy to prepare. I replaced a Tablespoon of oil with chili oil instead and it gave the salad a nice kick.

I made this with the suggested improvements of sesame oil and red pepper flakes. While it is very good, it just wasn't the all-time great recipe that I was expecting based on the reviews. The dressing was too strong and pungent. Perhaps it would have been better with 30-50% more vegetables. I love strong, pungent things but the garlic was overwhelming. I wish I had tried it out alone first before making it for a potluck because it was too shockingly garlicky for a potluck.

I had a whole bunch of cabbage leftover from making borscht over the weekend ("Hot Beef Borscht with Sour Cream" -- perfection!) and no clue what to do with it. Cabbage is definitely not one of my favorite vegetables and I've never been a coleslaw fan. However, I love peanut-y Asian flavors and had nearly all the dressing flavors on hand so I decided to try out this recipe. I used honey instead of brown sugar, just because it's easier. Since I didn't have any green onions, bell peppers, and red cabbage, my slaw consisted only of the green cabbage, shredded carrot, and fresh cilantro. It still tastes delicious! I love how easy and inexpensive this recipe is. If I was going to make it for guests I'd definitely try it out with the other colorful veggies and some chopped peanuts, as other reviewers have suggested.

This is a wonderful dressing for slaw...it IS a Super Slaw! And I have been loving the bagged broccoli slaw as well...so in a short time I had a great crunchy treat. The cilantro is a really nice addition...chopped fine so it mixes with the other flavors. Yum!

I'm a huge fan of asian cuisine in general and especially thai food, so I love peanut-flavored dishes. The peanut butter in this dressing is just enough to let you know it's there but isn't over the top like some peanut sauces. It's just really yummy and I love it. I've been making this dish for a couple of years now and just with the last batch I decided to throw in the cilantro which I was always leaving out for who knows what reason and it was really delicious, so I'll have to remember to keep using it. One tip- halve the dressing recipe and it makes just enough to dress a bag of broccoli slaw from the supermarket. Perfect for a weeknight if you're in a hurry and don't want to spend the time to shred everything yourself.

Rating: 4
This is fabulous. I make it with less oil, and substitute toasted sesame oil for the vegetable oil. The cilantro is a key piece of the flavor of this slaw. As other reviewers have mentioned, I make the dressing ahead of time, and dress only what I'm going to serve right away. This dressing is also really good as a sauce for hot pasta. I put it on fettuccine with crushed peanuts and chopped green onions. It's a really good quick dinner.

No one in our family could believe how good this salad was. My son, who doesn't really like coleslaw said that he had never tasted a slaw he liked as well as this one, in fact he loved it and kept coming back for more. Only changes I made were using honey instead of brown sugar, green peppers instead of red or yellow, and regular sweet onions instead of green onions. I didn't have these and made substitutions.

Yum! I used a bag of pre-shredded green and purple cabbage with the carrots already in it. I cut down the oil as suggested to 4 tablespoons and ran the sauce through my blender to make it nice and smooth. In my opinion, it doesn't really need the bell peppers unless you like the color. The cilantro really adds that extra something. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 3
Very good, although I think the oils could have been tamped down just a bit. I used half sesame/half veg, at the behest of other reviewers, and thought it a great addition. If you plan on having this salad later, definitely divide it from the dressing, as it tends to go soggy quite quickly.

OUT OF SIGHT!!! This is a fantastic way to eat cabbage. I love it. I was missing some of the ingredients but went forward with it nonetheless and am thrilled with the results.

Makes way too much sauce, I had at least a half cup left over and still thought it was too much. Other that though, it's an addictingly good coleslaw. I added extra ginger and about 2 TB red wine vinegar, and used sesame oil instead of veggie oil. All in all, very good.

Fantastic. My ultimate favorite slaw and it is great for picnics since there is no mayo in the dressing. And, because there are just 2 of us, I make the slaw and add the dressing as needed. Keeps for a week in fridge without the dressing. I also used some of the slaw in a stir-fry. It was absolutely delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. I've made in several times for family and friends and have found that even the most veggie-fearing of them did right in. (With one exception, but I don't think he's quite right in the head if you know what I mean.) I always make my changes and I must say that this doesn't need 5 Tbsp. of oil, I've found that one or two gives the sensation of fullness and slashes the fat content. I also like to add more ginger than called for, up to five Tbsp, it adds great spicy flavor and health benifits. Its a fantastic side for barbecue, but I think it would make a great meal topped with grilled shrimp or chicken and served with a side of brown rice. As an unappealing, but really rewarding sidenote, after you eat this one your body will feel scrubbed from the inside out! I refuse to elaborate.

This is a delicious accompaniment to BBQ chicken. I substituted 2 T of the oil for sesame oil and added 1 T of Vietnamese garlic chili sauce that I had in the house. Made it for an outdoor dinner party and even the picky eaters raved and ate seconds. The BFwants it again tonight!

This was a very tasty and refreshing side dish. I took the advice of others and substituted 4 of the 6 tablespoons of oil with sesame oil which gave it a nice flavor. I found pre-shredded cabbage and carrots at Whole Foods which saved me a lot of time. The dish is really colorful and makes a nice appearance. I would not make this the day before - the cabbage starts to leak water as I found out the next day when I went to eat the leftovers. It is served best within an hour of mixing the cabbage with the dressing. Next time I will experiment by adding a little hot spice of some kind.

Delish. I will make this again and again. It's a lot less work intensive if you use a food processor. I used the slicing blade for the cabbage, peppers, and scallions and the shredding blade for the carrots. Super easy.

I usually try to follow a recipe fairly closely the first time, so the only change I made was to add a pinch of cayenne, I'll add a bit more next time. I will have to say, trying to cut carrots to matchstick size is time consuming. Next time I will coarsely grate them instead. I will also use sesame oil instead of the canola I used, just for more Asian flair. I took this to a picnic and it was a success, but I didn't like how watery the dressing became.

Rating: 3
What a winner this is! I used 3 tbsps olive oil and 2 tbsps sesame oil and chunky peanut butter for the dressing -it was absolutely perfect.For the slaw, I reduced the cups of green cabbage to 4 when I could see it all in the bowl and increased the carrots to 3 because I left out the bell peppers (none of us can digest them raw). The coriander (cilantro) really makes it. One other point: the dressing really needs to be whizzed in a food processor to get a really good consistency - the peanut butter doesn't blend very easily in a bowl.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes from Epicurious. I do change the recipe up a bit, however. Instead of green cabbage, I substitute Napa Cabbage and I usually shred the carrots. If you will keep the dressing separate from the slaw and only toss as you need, it will keep in the refrigerator for many days. This recipe is wonderful for adding an edge to simple barbeque fair. It doesn't ever feed as many as the recipe says - because people go back for seconds and thirds. I've never had anything but compliments on this recipe (except for those who don't like peanuts/allergic to them). I've passed this recipe on to many friends - which I don't do often unless the recipe is a real keeper.

I have made this several times, and it is always a hit. Great alternative to traditional cole slaw for bbqs and summer meals. Use the pre-chopped bag of cabbage and carrots for slaw and it is super quick and easy. Don't add the dressing until close to when you want to eat so the cabbage doesn't water.

Wowee! I served this to a group of professional athletes as a side to pulled pork sandwiches. Every shred of the slaw was gone, but a few sandwiches remained. Go figure.

This was a rare case where I totally disagree with the overwhelming majority of the reviews (the great reviews, which were the reason I made this in the first place). This was ba-a-a-d - I'll refrain from other adjectives. I almost think I may have made it wrong but other than shredding the cabbage and mixing the dressing ingredients there was no way to go wrong. No accounting for taste, I guess, but I'd give this fewer than 1 fork if I could.

This is excellent! I made it for a small BBQ last night. We served it with a variety of "designer" sausages from Whole Foods and the chili lime sweet potato salad from this site. Our guests loved it. I will definitely make this again, and again. I used one bag of shredded cabbage and a cup of pre-shredded carrots. I used red and yellow peppers. I used chunky peanut butter and reduced the oil by one tablespoon. The next time I will try reducing the oil a little more. I completely underestimated the size of bowl I needed for the finished dish and ended up transfering it three times while I was putting it all together. Duh!

Super recipe. I made it last night and am eating another batch as I type this! Last night I followed the recipe exactly (although I've halved it both times), and today I've made a few adjustments and additions. Adjustments: toasted sesame oil vs vegetable oil, red pepper seasoned rice vinegar, extra chucky Jif peanut butter. Additions: Kame brand hot chili sauce with garlic, few dashes of cayenne red pepper, and topped with chopped peanuts and lime juice. I felt the sauce needed a bit of a spicy kick hence all the spicy additions.

We used the dressing portion of this as a last minute dressing for a package of precut slaw. Yummy and the rest of the family loved it too. Would have loved to have added the cilantro. Went great with our BBQ Terrikyaki Chicken. Also I so much agree with QueenCeleste from New York. That issue from Bon Appetite was one of the best ever! We just made Orzo with Everything for millionth time and once again others were begging for the recipe!

Really delicious, but it can hardly be called "slaw" even if it is made with cabbage. It's more of an Asian salad. Of course, I used a bit of sesame oil and that really gave it an Asian flavor. I used preshredded cabbage and pre-matchsticked carrots, but I matchsticked my own red peppers and green onions. What a chore! Next time I will simply slice the green onions in the the usual way. The red peppers are easier to matchstick. I will definitely make this salad again and again. The dressing would make a fine dressing for Chinese chicken salad too.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it. Next time I will add a little fresh chili paste to the dressing, I will also try chunky peanut butter instead of creamy because I think the bits of peanuts might be a nice addition.

Holy slaw! this makes enough for mobs of people! As written, it makes enough for a crowd. I love me some leftovers, but I did not expect to have to bust out the 'overflow' bowls. Matchsticking is such a chore for me - I opt for a decent chop. I agree with whomever said it: the dressing would be *fab* with noodles. I might add a bit of red pepper flakes for a kick in a sauce, but that's just me. Anyway, to review the recipe, I think it's a really nice, healthy twist on slaw and would receive a great welcome in a crowd.

What a great summer dish. I made it the other night for company exactly as written except cut down a bit on the cilantro. I used three different color peppers (red, yellow and orange) and served in a clear glass bowl. Beautiful, and it went well with the grilled london broil (which had been marinated with a Thai style marinade) that I served as the main course. Note that it serves more than the 4 to 6 stated in the recipe. I'd estimate at least 10 servings.

This was wonderful. I used savoy cabbage (no red cabbage at all) and took another reviewer's suggestion to use less rice vinegar and added a little lime juice. Wonderful. I made what I thought was a LOT and there was almost none leftover. A keeper for sure!

Please note: I am only reviewing the dressing as I already reviewed the salad June 2. As per the suggestion of a previous reviewer (thank you!), I made the dressing for an Asian noodle and it was fantastic. Did make a few wee changes: reduced rice vinegar to 3 tbsp. and added the juice and fine zest of a large lime; reduced vegetable oil to 3 tbsp. and added 3 tbsp. toasted sesame oil. Tossed the dressing with spaghettini (broken in half), chopped red peppers, sliced green onions, coarsly minced cilantro, chopped dry-roasted peanuts, and garnished with toasted sesame seeds. What a great noodle salad! Give it a try and I'm certain you will not be disappointed.

My husband and I loved this. I chopped up the veggies and made the dressing the night before and combined it just before dinner. Half the recipe made about 6 cups. I only used 2 of those cups, adding 1/4 cup dressing, so that it will still be as fresh tomorrow. The brown dressing didn't hide the colors of the veggies, so it was pleasing to the eye as well as the palate. I plan to make this for our next picnic.

A crunchy salad with bold/complex flavours and a great dressing. But, lacking in eye appeal when mixed/ready to serve. The thickness and colour of the dressing "muddies/dirties" all those lovely veggies. Loved the dressing and will definitely make it again, but think it would be better just drizzled over a different greens/lettuce mix rather than used for a slaw-type salad where it has to be thoroughly mixed with the veggies.

Rating: 4
This dish is easy to make (especially if you use one of those bags of pre-shredded cole slaw mix at the supermarket--I like to use the "broccoli slaw" mix that our local grocer carries). It's also very delicious. I added a touch of sesame seed oil as one reviewer suggested, and a half cup of peanuts for extra crunch, but the recipe is also great as is. To allow flavors to develop fully, mix the dressing and veggies together 30 minutes to an hour before serving. A big hit at barbecues and picnics.

A very nice side dish for a picnic or to serve alongside anything. I served this along with a Chinese-style whole friend chicken, and it was perfect. Don't worry about having all the veggies listed here - even if you only have some cabbage and carrots on hand, it's still very nice. I also added some julienned daikon. I found this to be too much oil - I put in only 2 tbsp of oil and added a bit of sesame oil for flavor, and diluted with a few tbsp of water - perfect. Dress this lightly - you can always add more dressing if needed. Great the next day as well!

I have made this many times. It's perfect to take to potlucks or for a crowd. After it's been sitting for awhile it gets a little soupy from water from the cabbage (since you don't salt and drain the cabbage prior), but I like to pour off the sauce after the first time I serve it and have it the next day or two -- it's crunchy and maybe even yummier the next day that way. Great recipe.

Loved it! Wonderfully different dressing for a really neat mix of veggies. I left out the cilantro since I didn't have any, substituted 3TBSP sesame oil for three of veg oil, and omitted one tablespoon of the brown sugar RE other reviewers' comments, and I loved it. I'd personally like a little more peanut butter flavor, so I'll probably add more next time, and possibly use chunky instead of smooth. Other than that, I'd change nothing. The only thing I disliked about this recipe was the whole matchstick carrot and pepper thing - what a PITA! Guess I'll have to break down and actually learn to use that mandoline I bought..........:-)

This recipe is delicious, quick and easy, and it can be modified to use different ingredients.

A big July 4th hit! We all said the same thing: add some shredded chicken and bingo: Chinese Chicken Salad, especially if you DO shred your cabbage finely from scratch.

Note to Reading, PA and others: if you don't think you'll finish this in one meal, toss half the slaw and store the remaining dressing and veggies separate for a day or two. I haven't made it yet but there are only two of us so I will plan on doing this myself.

FANTASTIC! Added spicy thai sauce for a bit more heat. Otherwise, an excellent dish.

Nice and flavorful sauce. You definitely need to eat the whole salad, cannot keep for leftovers. I had to throw away the extra. I didn't have fresh cilantro, so omitted.

My guests really enjoyed this one. The combination of crunchy veggies was just delicious. Great side dish with grilled chicken. I personally thought it was a bit too heavy on the peanut butter flavor, so I will use a bit less pb next time. I added jicama and used pre-shredded cabbage, too to save time.

This was delicious and very flavorful! I followed the advice of the other reviewer who suggested buying the prepackaged slaw mix, which cut down on prep time enormously.

i made this slaw for a casual dinner party and everyone went nuts over it. it was the greatest hit and i'd definately make it again. the prep time was a bit much, but well worth it!

As a busy caterer I use this recipe all the time and my clients love it. Here's a few time saving tips..I use pre-shredded cabbage mix with red cabbage, also I buy julienned carrots in a bag...I have seen them in supermarkets, so I know they should be available to the home cook.

Absolutely wonderful!! Everyone is hesitant at first to try it and then one bite and they're heaping the slaw on their plates!!! I do prefer it served right away. Don't much care for it after it sits over night.

Wonderful. I have made this for several events and everyone raves. Don't change a thing.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! As others have said, it is somewhat labor intensive, but the julienned veggies make for a beautiful presentation. The night before I simply prepped all veggies except for cabbage and stored in a single zip lock, and also mixed the dressing and held in the fridge. All I had to do the day of was to shred the cabbage (which the food processor makes a whiz.) I made the recipe as is for a Fourth of July side dish alongside beef BBQ sandwiches and found it to be a real crowd-pleaser.

Brought this to a party and it was a hit.. Everyone there asked me for the recipe. Did use 3 tbls sesame oil instead of 6 of vegetable. I also added cashews which I thought really made it special. Can't wait to make it again.

Rating: 4
This slaw is super! I used half the amount of oil and used sesame instead. I also used only one tablespoon of brown sugar at first as recommended by some cooks but I think the sugar amount may need to be adjusted depending on the kind of peanut butter you use. I ended up using three as the recipe said. I will make this again for sure.

Rating: 3
I agree with the other users.....cut the brown sugar down to 1 1/2 TB. I also substituted 3TB or sesame oil for teh 6 TB of veggie oil....that just seemed like too much oil for the salad. If you're not planning on serving this right away, store the dressing in a separate container and dress the salad right before you're going to serve it to prevent it from getting too mushy. Overall, a yummy recipe!

A delicious slaw with an Asian twist! I suggest not to let the slaw sit too long or it will get a little soggy. Overall, will definitely make again!

Made this for a picnic and my guests went back for thirds! There was none left. Would definitely make again.

The verdict is in: husband says this is the best slaw he's ever had. I concur. I used one red pepper and cabbage, onion, and cilantro. I subbed 2 T sesame oil for the cooking oil (you truly don't need the cooking oil) and used chunky peanut butter because that is what I have. Since I was making it for taste and not appearance, I found that shredding the cilantro and pepper along with the cabbage, and slicing the onions in rounds, sufficed and saved time.

Very good salad for a party. Next time I think I will cut one tablespoon of brown sugar from the dressing, it was a bit sweet. Everyone raved over it. A nice change from the usual cole slaw. I also added some chopped cashews.

This was SOOooo GOOD!! I had some cocktail peanuts that I chopped and added to it. It would make a meal if chicken was added. Next time I would cut the brown sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons it was really sweet. This is really a great salad!!

I've made this recipe several times and always receive great reviews. I skip the oil to make the dressing lowfat and it tastes delicious. I have also served this salad at buffets inside little "pepperboats" made of half green peppers. It's always a BIG HIT!

We brought this to a casual dinner party last night. We knew our hosts were serving brisket, brats, and grilled wings so thought this would be a nutritious and unusual side dish. It was the hit of the dinner! The meat-loving crowd raved over the peanut dressing and most went back for seconds. It is beautifully colorful (1 red, 1 yellow pepper!), wonderfully crunchy, and delightfully aromatic in a Thai-inspired way. We followed previous suggestions to add a little red pepper flakes to the dressing, and also cut the sugar and oil to good effect. With the small amount we have left over (we made a large quantity) we are going to make "fusion burritos" (thanks to another reviewer for the idea) with chicken and Thai sticky rice. This is a keeper - you MUST try it!

Everyone just loved this including my kids! I was in a bit of a hurry so I did not take the time to cut everything into matchsticks but it came out great anyway. It is a very easy and elegant dish!

A long time favorite. I added sugar snaps. It was also good warm. I added beans and chicken made burritos.

I served this one with orange and ginger chicken. I had to make a lot of chages on the recipe because I was running out of a lot of things. I used lettuce instead of cabbage, skipped the peanut butter and added basil instead of cilantro. It was still delicious. Next time I'll try to stick to the original :)

This Slaw is a great recipe, but I would make a couple of changes. I took it to a Salad Supper of a group of 11 women, of varying ages. I noticed the older women skipped over it, and the younger women loved it. I heard one of the older women say, "I didn't try that because it looks like it's too hard to eat." I "matchsticked" all the ingredients with my sharp chef's knife, but I think the pieces were still too big to the eye and for the fork. I will, next time, make the pieces much smaller--perhaps even buying those little grated carrots as a time-saver. I would be careful with the garlic, too, as it seemed a little powerful. Perhaps my garlic (homegrown) was a little too 'hot'. Everyone LOVED the sauce, otherwise, and didn't share my opinion that it was too garlicky--the peanut butter and cilantro is so GOOD together!

Have finally found the 'perfect' slaw/salad dressing. I use it on everything. This recipe has walked out the door with all my friends. Big hit! I add a touch more fresh grated ginger and leave out the peanut butter, still perfect.

Everyone seems to complain about the chopping. Is it worth the extra effort or should I just buy matchstick carrots and chopped cabbage in the grocery store?

To the cook the the allergic husband - I've made this several times, and have altered the ingredients depending on what i had on hand at the time. On 2 occasions, I've substituted sesame oil for the oil, and omitted the peanut butter. The flavor was different than the original recipe, but still very tasted. Add some toasted sesame seeds right before serving, and it adds a nice crunch. Hopefully your husband isn't allergic to sesame as well. Good luck!

Depending on the extent of your husband's allergies, could you use tahini? It is basically "sesame butter", and the sesame flavor is also very common in Asian style foods. Good luck.

Very good recipe that I have made before, but also didn't like all the work "matchsticking". I solved the problem with a mandoline. I bought an inexpensive one online by Benriner (about $30)and I had everything finely sliced in no time! I can't tell you how easy it is with the right tool. I really wasn't going to make this again because of the work involved....glad I stumbled across the recipe again. Marvelous!

This is GREAT!!! I took a reviewer's advice and used one red and one yellow pepper for color. It's really really beautiful. I can't wait to bring this to a potluck this summer. Great with grilled salmon, although honestly, nothing else on the plate really has much zing compared to this.

Delicious, colorful and a big hit at a bbq yesterday. Fresh and crunchy. This will become a staple recipe. As previous reviewer did, I used green, red and napa cabbage, two colors bell peppers. The dressing recipe makes a lot extra; don't need it all. I only used about 1/2 cup. Definitely use 2T sesame oil/4T canola oil for added flavor. Made the dressing and prepped all veggies the night before and kept seperate, then tossed before party. Can't wait to serve this again!

I made some changes to this recipe just for my personal tastes, and I'm so glad I did! I used Napa Cabbage instead of regular green cabbage, and used 1 red pepper and 1 yellow pepper instead of using two red or two yellow. I matchsticked everything according to the recipe, and the colors were stunning. For the dressing I used 4 TBS vegetable oil and 2 TBS of sesame oil to give it more Asian flavor, added 2 tsp Thai Chili Sauce and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Just before serving I added 3 TBS sunflower seed kernels. I took this to an office party and it knocked their socks off! I put everything but the peppers in a gallon size zippy bag and took the sliced peppers and sunflower seeds in individual bags also, and took the dressing in a separate container. A half hour before the party I tossed everything together in a bowl, and watched them swarm like locusts! This is going to be my signature salad!

We doubled it (and probably didn't need to) so the matchsticking slowed us down quite a bit. If anyone has any "matchsticking made easy" tips, I'd love to hear them! Otherwise, the recipe was delicious and different among the usual summer pasta salads, etc.

I Love this recipe, I have been making it since it came out in Bon Appetit in 1998. Since I found this I volunteer to bring salads everywhere. People are a;ways asking for the recipe. I sometimes just by a bag of packaged salad add some green onions, bell pappers, cilantro, and then the dressing. It saves a lot of time.

I agree with Atlanta. What a waste of a good sauce. Make the sauce and use it over noodles and chicken.

I am not a fan of bell peppers so I substituted them with Poblano Peppers. This gave the recipe an extra kick. I like this slaw because of the larger ingredients that are not usually in other slaws.

Chopping, chopping and more chopping! I thought the peanut butter made for a heavy soupy sauce. If I made it again, I would subtract the peanut butter and use sesame oil for a nutty flavor without the heavy texture.

You can keep the dressing for a while and mix it up a batch at a time for a quick fresh salad - even the veggies will keep a few days with the exception of the red pepper.

I agree with most of the reviewers of this recipe: it's delicious and lovely to serve. It is, however, lots of work to cut all the vegetables in teeny little matchstick size and shape. But, it's worth it. Next time I make it, I'm going to try to do some of the prep work the day before. I served it with a BBQ pork tenderloin and it was a great combo. For Labor Day, I think I'm going to match it with BBQ flank steak sandwiches with grill roasted red peppers on Italian garlic bread. YUM!

For those who like asian flavors this is a great recipe. I used extra chunky peanut butter and it worked well and gave it that additional asian zip. It is not a recipe for guests who like a traditional slaw. I agree that you could grate the carrot. Would make it again, especially for a change of pace from usual slaw.

Rating: 3
The dressing gets 4 forks alone, but 3 when combined with the cabbage. I adore good cole slaw, but I think this particular dressing is destined for much greater things. I would toss it with linguine, chicken, chopped peanuts and steamed asparagus for an awesome Thai Peanut Chicken entree. It reminds me of the bottled Thai Peanut dressing I used to buy from Williams-Sonoma, but oh so much less expensive! I will make the slaw again, but will shred all ingredients much finer using the processor. I made the cabbage as thin as possible by hand, but it still was too chunky for this delicate, wonderful dressing.

This is a great salad. I grated the carrots rather than matchsticking them and it was fine. A really interesting dressing.

Very good dish.I agree with others that the peanut butter could be reduced and the vinegar increased --- along with some red pepper flakes. Slightly sauteeing the garlic with some red onion makes the whole thing mellower.Lacking other ingredients, we made this with matchstick carrots, matchstick turnips, and shredded Napa cabbage. Works well with ribs and a potato gratin.
