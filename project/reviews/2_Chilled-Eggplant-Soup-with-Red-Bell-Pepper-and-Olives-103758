Weird, extremely thick and unpleasant to eat soup. The garnish was the best part; the rest of the soup was tasteless and _way_ too thick--and this from someone who loves both eggplant and chilled soups!

I roasted the peppers with a jalenpeno pepper. I added the peppers to the soup in the food processor, as my children will eat more creamy things. The flavors were delicious!

Was refreshing but agree with another reviewer that it could take some zing, like cayenne. Discovered, however, that it makes a great dip with pita bread or crackers!

Can take or leave mint. Depends on what it's served with. Great with my own cured olives. Like to add cayenne or lemon to this RAW

My husband would kill me if I made him eat this again!

Although I enjoy eggplant in most all recipes, I didn't enjoy the mingled flavors of eggplant, red pepper, yoghurt and mint. The result was a bit bland for my taste.
