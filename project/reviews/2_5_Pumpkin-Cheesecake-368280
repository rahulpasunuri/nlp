Made this for Thanksgiving. At first wondered if I should add a sour cream topping, but it was wonderful without it. I did serve it with a little whipped cream on top, but really didn't need anything else. Everyone really liked it.

This was so delicious, and so well-received, that I'm making it for the second time -- this time for Thanksgiving! I disagree with the folks who thought the gingersnaps were too much work. They were delicious... and let's face it... making the cookies for the crust gives you extra bragging rights! :) Hee hee!

I made this cheesecake for a dinner party and it was excellent. I pureed the ricotta as directed and the cake was perfectly smooth. Although the cookies do take a little more time, they are delicious and the recipe makes a few more than needed for the cake (they were great with coffee the next day). The cooking method was also worth the effort and easy to manage if you're in the kitchen working on other parts of a meal.

Being a cheesecae and pumpkin lover I decided to try this against my better judgement. I say that because it was mostly ricotta, which always disappoints me with its grainy texture. Because of the mascarpone, I thought it might make a difference. It really didn't. The recipe was extremely time consuming and fussy. Why would you go to the trouble of making gingersnap cookies for the crust?! Was like adding insult to injury! Bought some and proceeded as described, but the foil linings, the opening and closing to vent steam and the excessive time it took to bake made this recipe something I would never make again. I had to turn the oven up to 325 because I was already over 2 hrs of baking time and it was still extremely jiggly. A baking adventure that tasted alright but not worth the effort.

Not worth the trouble. The recipe is hard to follow, the texture was disappointing. The flavor was good, although I added more spices as others recommended.

I made this receipe for Thanksgiving and it wasn't as good as I had hoped. The ricotta gives it a 'grainy' texture and the overall flavor was bland. I even added generous amounts of spices to help and it still wasn't quite enough. I did go the extra mile and made the crust which turned out delicious but it was definitely an effort. It ended up being the best tasting part of the recipe!

Not a review - just a comment. Why on earth would you make your own gingernaps for this crust? Seriously - TJ's triple gingersnaps or any other store-bought variety would save time without compromising flavor.

Made the cake for a lunch. It was delicious, every one loved it. The directions are a little difficult to follow. Read the recipe before starting. I am making it again for Thanksgiving.

Made this and was not impressed. The texture was grainy the flavor was not very good. Rather a waste of ingrediants I thought.
