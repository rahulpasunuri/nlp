I'm a Dad who cooks for kids and I love this. The whole family eats it and it travels well to cookouts and works nice on care calendars.

Really a nice side dish. I reduced the olive oil to 2 TB, added extra lemon zest, some fresh rosemary along with the parsley. I also added some feta cheese and a squeeze of lemon juice. The flavor was clean & crisp -- hard to stop eating it was so good. Served as a side with BA Teriyaki Salmon. Will definitely make again for family and company.

New favorite orzo recipe! I did follow the advise of others and double the amount of lemon zest and added feta cheese. I also did buy marinated artichokes and chopped them up. Even my husband who said he "hated" orzo loved this last night!

This is a delicious, summery dish that is always welcomed enthusiastically each time I make it. The lemon zest gives it that summery feeling as well as the fact that it's great served chilled or room temperture.I do not like many cold pasta sadads that I've tried, I usually skip them after one taste.

Easy and delicious. Great with many main dishes. I add more pine nuts, minced sun dried tomatoes, sometimes goat cheese or feta. Agree that it can take less olive oil, and I did not like as well with EVOO so I just used regular. Be sure to add plenty of salt at the end - if you think it's bland, that's probably why. I used white wine vinegar the last time and liked it better. Also frozen artichoke hearts work well.

As many others have already suggested, I also added some crumbled feta and sun dried tomatoes and a few splashes of balsamic. I really enjoy this dish, but have had mixed reviews serving it to others.

This gets three forks with the additions others suggested, including crumbled feta and capers. Otherwise, this dish is quite bland. I like to serve it cold as a bbq side dish, or b/c I'm the only vegetarian in the fam, as a main for me and a side for others.

Very easy recipe and great for a large group. I made just a few changes, instead of using red wine vinegar, I used Balsamic vinegar, I also added Kalamata olives and feta cheese.

I was not too impressed with this when I made it for a dinner party for 20 people so before serving, I added a few ingredients to make it taste better. I added feta cheese, a squeeze of lemon (I know, overkill because it has vinegar) and added kosher salt and freshly ground pepper as well. I will say that this improved the recipe for me and after having let it sit in the fridge and then warm to room temperature, it really turned out well. I got a lot of compliments on it from the guests. So, all in all, I will probably make it again.

This was a perfect side dish for a group of plain eaters. It didn't scare anyone, but was still unique and elegant enough for entertaining. It can easily be made ahead of time. I did add crumbled feta, which was a great addition.

This recipe is easy, and yet impressive enough for company. I used more pinenuts, just because there was a little more in the pkg, and also added shrimp. I also cut the olive oil in half and never missed it. Absolutely fabulous!!

I took others' advice and added a bit more lemon zest - turned out great! I'd add tomatoes for color. I also tried adding feta and capers to some of it, which worked well, but maybe too salty for some.

I agree with most of the other comments. Very simple and easy to make and very good flavor. I also added the capers and cheese...I also added sun dried tomatoes and decided that if I had added some kind of meat i.e, chicken, shrimp, scallops, spicy sausage, or prosciutto ham then it would have made this dish a much better main course. As it was it felt more like a side dish.

Delicious and easy recipe which looks like a lot of work. Great for family OR company. As others have noted, it does need to be "kicked up a notch" from the original recipe. I added extra seasoning as well as sauted mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. It would be wonderful with Feta as well. Overall a great recipe to play with, you can't go wrong!

I found this recipe very easy and quick, and I like that. I added some chopped capers as others had suggested and some freshly grated parmigiana. I also used frozen artichokes, which steamed in the microwave while I cooked the orzo. I left out one major thing...the pine nuts. I'm a poor college student unwilling to make a special trip to the grocery for one thing.

easy to throw together and tasty. added shredded chicken snd chevre & used penne pasta instead of orzo. will definitely make again. good weeknight meal.

Easy to make and agree with other reviewers it is good both hot and cold - but needs a bit more punch. I'll add olives, etc next time.

Recipe lacked color so I added kalamata olives, diced roma tomatoes and shredded parmesean cheese. I think those extra ingredients gave this a kick. Don't skip toasting the pinenuts, it really enhances the flavor. Would definitely make this again.

Yummy - we substituted rice wine vinegar for a softer summer taste, and amped up the amount of lemon zest and pine nuts. A keeper for sure!

Rating: 4
This is a definite crowd pleaser and so very easy to adapte to all tastes. Whether chilled or hot, I've cooked this several times and always get rave reviews. Cooked for a non-artichoke fan and instead added chopped sundried tomatoes (in olive oil) and grilled chicken with parmesan grated on top. Also tried with sauteed spinach added in...this recipe is perfect to play around with for any crowd. Love the lemon zest. Definitely a keeper!

I only added halved cherry tomatoes and a few extra pine nuts - found it to be delicious, both as a warm dish and a cold salad.

This is excellent. We have served to guests numerous times and everyone loves it. Great to take to parties. We even eat it as a snack or for lunch on weekends.

Added chopped sun-dried tomatoes and some capers. They added nice flavor, color and the saltiness of the capers was a good addition. I thought it was a little bland before this. It's now delicious and I've served it to many guests who love it!

I add hand peeled shrimp, and a tiny bit of maple syrup and serve it as a salad. People go nuts for it. I've made it serveral times, and I have yet to have left-overs!

This was very yummy...however, I did go with the advice of one of the other reviews and went for 1/3 cup pinenuts...I think that added...I might add in the future some roasted garlic cloves and crumbled goat cheese to put it up to the 4 fork level....overall we will do it again!

This is a simple quick recipe to make when you don't have a lot of time to create a nice side dish, especially if you already have these ingredients on hand. I added 1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes. For the olive oil, I used half/half evoo and oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. I added an extra tablespoon of pine nuts. Delicious with thse changes. I'm thinking of adding 1-1/2 tablespoons of coarsely chopped capers the next time.

great, easy recipe. add a touch more salt and a tablespoon or two of lemon juice in addition to the rind.

superb recipe! Be generous with your best olive oil and squeeze every bit of water out of the canned articokes.

For a simple preparation, this is quite tasty. Lightly toasted, the pine nuts really make the dish. Great with lamb & Greek salad.

With a few changes, this made an excellent side dish. I doubled the artichokes and discarded the leaves. Added sundried tomatoes and 1/3 cup of pine nuts. Everyone loved this and I will definetely make this again.

Great, simple recipe. Tastes better the next day, cold. I've made this about 3-4 times, and it's a keeper. Have added chopped romaine a few times. (Make sure you use best quality olive oil, of course.)

I made it exactly according to recipe and found it to be rather blah. The upgrades suggested by the other reviewers sound like the way to go with this dish.

This is a wonderful salad! Very light and refreshing. I added crumbled goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes which helped to round out the flavors a bit. Next time I may try adding grilled chicken breast as well. A definite keeper.

The lemon zest is crucial here. Made this for a last-minute cookout potluck, and it was well-received. Of course, by the time it was ready (took longer than the 15 minutes advertized by Gourmet!) maybe our guests were just hungry. I found the salting of this a challenge. Between the cooking water and the dressing, I was afraid of overdoing it - but ended up underdoing it instead. I feel like this dish needs *one* more element, something that won't spoil the freshness of it. Another kind of toasted nut to sprinkle on top?

Easy and tasty. I used grilled artichoke (couldn't find a can to save my life) instead. Would also like to try with tomota to add some color, and perhaps parmesan!

Based on a previous reviewer's comment, I turned this into a salad. I followed the recipe and added cherry tomatoes and feta. A delicious potluck contribution. I can't really imagine eating this warm...but it certainly was good cold.

My husband liked this more than I. I would make it again, but would substitute sundried tomatoes for the artichokes.

I really enjoyed this dish. I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out well. It's not a highly flavorful dish, but it has nice flavor and texture and I'll certainly make it again. I love artichokes, ditto pine nuts, so I'll probably add more next time. The orzo makes the texture so soft and creamy. I had it cold the next day as a pasta salad, and it was really good. The flavor is a little unexpected; it has the tang of vinegar instead of the richness of cheese, which one might expect with these ingredients, but it's a nice, light side dish.
