I found a sale on turkey scallopini and, because it was so inexpensive, I bought it UP...then I tried to find some recipes..that wasn't successful but this recipe was a dream come true!!! It is tender and it is not dry -- beautiful! I didn't have dried bread crumbs so I substituted cornmeal...oooh very yum!

I've used this recipe frequently, and typically serve it with the Chive Jive New Potatoes recipe (also on this site - Bon Appetit '96) to keep with the low fat theme. Only changes are to first dredge the cutlets in flour, and sometimes use panko for crumbs. Love the vinaigrette for the greens and use it often with side salads to accompany quiches or other light/simple dishes. It's a perfect way to lightly dress a salad.

Tasty and easy. Dredge the cutlets in flour before putting them in the eggwash. That way the crumbs adhere much better.

Delicious! I loved the contrast of the sweet dressing and the arugula. I also served it with pasta w/ garlic and oil. This is a keeper.

Fantastic. Very flavourful and everyone loved it. I baked this instead of pan frying. ! also added fresh thyme and may use fresh lemon thyme when i next make it. (will need to quadruple the recipe!)

A big hit with the whole family. I finished the turkey off in the oven for 25 minutes at 325 degrees. It was juicy and flavorful.

Fabulous. I used Panko for the breadcrumbs. A winner.

Easy and fast, light, not to filling, but fresh. I served with a small side of pasta with oil and garlic.

Simple and delicious. I used fresh rosemary ( 1 1/2 tsp or so) and a bit more parmesan than it called for. The turkey was flavorful and tender -- just delicious. The salad dressing was also quite tasty and took no effort to make. I used a fresh orange and squeezed a tblsp or so of juice into the mix. It was so good to have a fresh, chemical-free dressing for the salad. It's a wonder to me why anyone would buy a balsamic vinagrette in a bottle.
