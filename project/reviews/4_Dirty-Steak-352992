Tried this tonight for the first time, and I may never go back to ordinary "on the grill" cooking. Used 1-1/2" thick aged New York strip steaks and cooked them 4 minutes on each side. Some of the natural hardwood charcoal stuck to the steak but was easily knocked off. I let the steaks rest for 5-10 minutes on a board, loosely covered with foil. The steaks were perfectly medium rare with a delightful smokey flavor, slight char on the outside and moist on the inside. Did not use butter or lemon, but added a little more salt after cooking which is my preference. Please try this. You will not be disappointed.

Be sure to use only"Natural Hardwood" charcoal fired with newspaper. DO NOT USE Briquettes nor lighter fluids!

We are always on the lookout for dishes we can cook using our chiminea, and this one fits the bill perfectly. You may want to brush the steaks quickly after they come off to remove any large ash chunks. I like my steaks topped with carmelized onions.
