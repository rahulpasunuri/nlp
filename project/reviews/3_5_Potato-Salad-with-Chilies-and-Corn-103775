Oooh, Delicious! This takes quite a while to prep, but salt it generously as advised, let the flavors meld and enjoy. We make this regularly and are never disappointed.

Oh, this is such a high maintenance recipe, however, it is so awesome it's worth it every time I make it.

This did take a long time to make; but I'll be making it again for sure. Like so many vegetarian and vegan recipes, it calls for a lot of vegetable prep. and knife time. I didn't use the entire bunch of watercress. Just a little to color the sides of the platter. My family of four gobbled it up. It did have a few hours in the refrigerator for all the flavors to meld. Thanks to everyone who mentioned the need for generous salting. I salted to taste and stirred it in the refrigerator about every 15 minutes. We all loved the southwestern flavors. I served it with homemade grilled chicken burgers, topped with avocado, melted cheese, and salsa. Delicious.

This was a ton of work, but really good. I left out the tomatoes and didn't miss them. The starch of the potatoes and the bites of corn were a nice contrast. The peppers added a sweet flavor here and there. It does need plenty of salt, as potatoes always do. I'll made a triple batch next time - kitchen economies of scale.

One of my all time favorite potato salad recipes! I add a lot more lime though and do not serve it over watercress.

This takes an incredible amount of time to make, so I double the batch because my husband has eaten it all by the next day. I don't serve it on the watercress (doesn't really go with watercress), but as a side on the plate. I am from Texas and this is right up my southwestern alley. I love this high maintenance dish. Will make it again and again.

This recipe took a long time to make and just didn't impress me. The taste was a little off, it seemed to need a lot of salt. I think for the time and effort put into the salad, it's not worth it.

I'm surprised by the other reviews - this recipe seems like a natural to me! Of course corn and potatoes go together, it is a classic combination, and to be spiced-up southwest style is a perfect complement. I used Yukon gold potatoes, added some black beans, and red bell pepper instead of yellow (since there was already yellow color from corn). The other addition I made was the grill the potatoes after boiling them. Delicious!

"impressive"?? No. The flavours just don't meld right. And the textures are weird - the corn and potatoes just don't feel right. Pass.

I found this to be a lighter alternative to the normal potato salads with a bit a spice. However, for the time it took to make, I wasn't that impressed.

I liked this dish especially. I am not wild about watercress, so i substituted that by putting butter lettuce leaves in a small bowl made out of a corn tortilia that had been shaped and fried. I also added some fresh avacado at the end for a creamy texture and taste that complimented the chilies.
