This is very good, and even better, I think, with 1/2 cup Reggiano parmesan folded into the risotto before topping it with the livers and truffle oil (I use Roland truffle oil, which is pricey but excellent, the best I've found). Folding a little butter into the risotto, or the livers, or both, doesn't hurt either, and definitely add some freshly ground pepper.

OMG! I loved this recipe. The flavors were exactly what I was looking for on a cold winter's night. I took one of the previous reviewers recommendations and used penne pasta rather than risotto and actually think it worked better. I would definitely recommend using the smaller livers as the larger ones were a bit gamey but other than that, I have no complaints. I will surely be making this again and sooner rather than later!

I really enjoyed this! It is incredibly rich and earthy. I think the truffle oil should not be considered an optional ingredient. I tried the livers with and without it, and it adds such a complexity to the flavors here.

Took MostlyBrownTom's reccomendation, used freshly made tagliatelli as rissotto for one is a PIA and I was strapped for time. Absolutely delish!

I'm a sucker for chicken livers anyway, especially in good dry sherry, but this recipe really is good. If you're cramped for time or not much of a hand at risotto, you can also just substitute for tagliatelle or even broad egg noodles for good results.

This is delicious. The truffle oil is a must.My husband rolled his eyeballs when I told him what we were having for dinner. But once he tasted it he licked his dish clean.

I think its lousy to criticize people that take a recipe and change it a little. It is more creative to be able to change a recipe or make substitutions when you can. This site is to share ideas not criticize. Not everyone has truffle oil but many might have liked the sound of the recipe. Lighten up people.

Very good. I added dried cranberries at the end-- the sweetness of the fruit, a perfect complement to the musky livers. B/c I couldn't find truffle oil, I had to settle with portabellos tossed in. Quite tasty and will make again.

I do not prepare liver all that often, but this recipe is becoming one of my favourite ways of preparing it. When I made it the first time, I was worrying about the risotto a bit, as its flavour is decideldy single-note, but that worry vanished when I had it with the livers - the combination of flavours and textures works really well.

I agree, if you don't have truffle oil or don't like chicken livers for goodness sake don't make this and expect to enjoy it as it was intended! Truffle oil is one of the single most divine ingredients in the world and is well worth purchasing and learning to cook with. You'll be absolutely amazed!

I thought the risotto was delicious although I did not have real truffle oil. I chopped the chicken livers into about half-inch pieces after cooking them and mixed them with the juices into the risotto when it was done cooking. Doing so added more flavor to the risotto.

It is simply outrageous to criticize a recipe when you didn't use ingredients vital to the outcome. If you don't have the truffle oil or don't like chicken livers, then don't make it!

Heavy dish but wonderful with a small salad for a brunch. Warning!!! You have to like livers to like this dish. Didn't have the truffle oil but when dish was done didn't seem anything was missing. Wonderful and luscious!

The chicken livers really did not go with the rest of the dish and the whole thing tasted quite awful. Like the other cook, I added mushrooms for that earthy flavour instead of truffle oil. I'm only glad I did not try this out the first time with guests waiting to eat!

This was extremely tasty--very rich and unctuous. I couldn't find any truffle oil when I decided to make this, so I simmered a few dried porcinis in the chicken broth to rehydrate them. Then I chopped them and sauteed them along with the livers. They added a great earthy quality.
