increase to 4 egg yolks, add 4 tsp of zest to the filling with the condensed milk and fresh lemon juice. strain and pour into pie shell. bake at 325 for 15 minutes..cool completely to room temp...chill for a couple of hours then top with meringue or whipped cream. now THIS is the one that will make ME slap my momma. from the joy of cooking and got RAVE reviews. tangy, creamy filling, it was so smooth. the entire pie was gone by the end of the night.

For the cook who is having difficulty with a runny meringue: next time, use 1 cup confectioners (powdered) sugar in lieu of granulated. Also, decrease the heat of the oven to 275 degrees and bake the pie about 30-40 minutes, until it is baked through. I live in a "high humidity" zone and found this is the best way to treat meringue. Good luck! ;)

This recipe is excellent. I accidentally added vanilla to the filling accidentally, and it still turned out great. I made this pie two days ago, and I am about to make it again for dinner tonight. A definite keeper.
