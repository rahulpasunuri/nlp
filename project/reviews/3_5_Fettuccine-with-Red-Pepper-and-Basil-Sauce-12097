3.5 forks! This was very good, although I made some additions based on other reviewers. I roasted the peppers, threw in some tomatoes I had in the fridge, and forgot to add the butter. Easy and tasty!

Looking for a sauce to use with some lemon pepper linguine...this was fabulous. Used jarred peppers because that is what I had on hand. Added halved cherry tomatoes and sauted zucchini for more veggies. Loved it and will make again. SIMPLY GOOD FOOD!

This definitely needed a little more than "a pinch" of red pepper flakes, but other than that it was fast, easy & good. I also added some left over roasted chicken to give it a little more substance.

A great change of pace from tomato-based sauces. I added a zucchini, which I sauteed in butter for a few minutes before adding the sauce back from the blender. Next time I'll probably use a little bit less chicken broth (1/2 cup?) since I thought it came out just a smidge too thin.

I had some oddly shaped whole-wheat pasta that I used with this. I didn't have a blender, so I followed someone else's advice for chopping it up fine and simmering. I added extra hot pepper and a little wine at the end, and it was delicious! I'll definitely try again with blending the sauce. Yum!

this was absolutely delicious; very rich and tasty. i like heat, so i'll add quite a bit more red pepper flakes next time, but otherwise the recipe is perfect as is.

Definitely easy to make, but kind of bland. Maybe more red pepper flakes would help. Also the sauce is very light and probably best for summer.

This is really good. I wasn't sure how it would all work, but wow, it does. I used juice of about a half a lemon and served it with grilled chicken marinated in the juice and zest of half a lemon, olive oil, garlic and thyme for about 4 hours. Yum.

This was a wonderful summertime dish, and the red pepper flavor really comes through. The only change I'll make the next time is to add 2 pinches of crushed red pepper for just a little more zip. Don't skip the lemon juice - it brightens the flavor nicely. We added maybe 2 tsp. of fresh lemon juice. Wonderful!

Very good, light. In leiu of fresh red peppers, I've used a 28oz can Italian roasted peppers with good results too.

Turned out really well. All of my guests enjoyed it. Next time, I will know to make more sauce. (Doubled recipe was enough for four with no leftovers.)

This was an excellent easy recipe. I prepared as per the recipe, but next time I want to experiment with adding some veggies to it to make it more nutritious/filling.

This is an awesome, fresh, summer pasta dish.

a wonderful recipe, i add just a touch of cream at the end, because everything is better with cream, & generously top with parmesean cheese.

Fantastic and super simple recipe. I've made up a number of batches of this for the freezer, as my produce store had red peppers for an incredibly low price. I made no changes in the recipe and found it to be a wonderful change of pace from tomato-based sauces and pretty fresh-tasting and nonfattening as well.

Not bland at all. Add more red pepper flakes or whatever to give it more kick. Quite quick and easy to make. Not too much mess. Interesting alternative to a tomato sauce. Try to use very ripe red peppers. The sweeter they are, the better the sauce. The only alterations I made to the sauce were replacing the fettuccine with linguine and using cayenne pepper in place of red pepper flakes (didn't have any). Overall nice and refreshing.

I thought that this dish was really bland. It was a little better after being in the refrigerator over night. I followed the directions exactly and don't think that I did something wrong but I was really unimpressed with the results.

Love this recipe. Served with grilled chicken the first time around, pan-seared shrimp the second time. Both results were fantastic.

This is absolutely great. I've made it several times. So much so that I've decided it will be the main course when I cook dinner in a few nights for the in-laws.

This was excellent. It was similar to a sauce we have had at a favorite restaurant which I have been trying to duplicate. I roasted the peppers because we love the taste, and omitted the lemon juice altogether.

This was delicious! I served it with some fresh hot crusty bread to soak up all the sauce. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was great. I used mint instead of basil and my girlfriend loved it... and I love her.

Great Dish! My husband loved it, which is not too often. I too, will try roasting the peppers the next time. I wasn't sure how much lemon juice to add, I ended up adding a half of lemon. Definitely will make again!

Very good, but could be better. More garlic and more red pepper flakes. Add a little chopped basil over the top before serving -- also look pretty. My husband suggested adding some roasted pine nuts, like pesto. That would be an excellent idea. I also will try it with roasted peppers next time -- in a pinch you could easily get away with the bottled ones. To make it an entree, consider adding a few broiled shrimp on top of the pasta -- they'd go beautifully with the sauce. A very good dish indeed.

Absolutely delicious. This recipe doubles well. I roasted and peeled the peppers. Can't wait to make it again.!

I needed a way to use the peppers from my garden so I tried this recipe based on the reviews....WOW!! Absolutely fabulous. I have already made it 4 times and have doubled the recipe. This is a very easy, restuarant quality pasta sauce. I used crushed red pepper for the pepper flakes and they gave it just the right bite.

Both my husband and I really liked this -- and we usually have VERY different tastes. I used vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth.

Oh my goodness, this dish was positively divine. perfect flavors, perfect color combinations...i loved it and will definitely make it again. Friends that I made it with joked that it was the best meal they had had that year. superb

Simple and subtle but delicious. I added broccoli - steamed it with the peppers which gave it a delicious flavour (did not puree it with the rest!).

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and had a great flavor and texture. This one is a keeper!

Tasty - but other versions of the same thing are better. I added shrimp at the end of the recipe. I suspect the bell pepper onion confit in this recipe file that goes with chicken would be tastier.

This was a really good recipe. I think I will add some sliced grilled peppers, onions and chicken and a little bit more cayenne pepper for some bite. I will also make more sauce so i have extra for dipping my bread into. YUM!!!

This was an excellent recipe! I didn't have a food processor handy so I cut the peppers into small pieces and sauteed really well. I also used yellow peppers and added leftover roasted chicken. Definite keeper!

Actually, that should be 3 1/2 forks! Made with green and regular fettuccine and substituting roasted red pepper strips for the fresh. Topped with Super-Rich Virginia Crab Cakes and grated Asiago -- a meal to remember.

Overall a good recipe. I didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I substituted basil pesto that I had and omitted the onion, garlic, oil. And, I used red and orange peppers, heavy cream for the butter and added romano cheese at the end. So, although I changed it drastically, it was still good. I think though that the fresh basil might make it just that much better. I'll definitely have to try it again!

This dish was great and easy. I didn't find it bland at all, it tasted about the way I expected it would. I love the taste of the red pepper and basil along with the parmesan cheese.

Unlike the other cook from Washington, DC, I found this recipe a complete winner. The ingredients are nutritious, and the results delicious. I would even skip the butter next time because it's just not needed.

I enjoyed throwing in a little diced chicken and zuccini. I also served it with a side of french bread and balsamic vinigre.

A little bland, but beautiful color. Easy to make. Needs plenty of salt and pepper, and strong Parmesan cheese to give it flavor.

This is a beatiful sauce. It looks like a thick cream sauce, and tastes like it as well, but without all the calories or fat. I added a zucchini along with the red pepper. It will be a very good recipe to serve guests as the presentation of the bright orange sauce is visually appealing as well as so tasty and easy!

This is my favorite pasta sauce now. I love it!! It freezes well and always feels like a special occasion when we eat it.
