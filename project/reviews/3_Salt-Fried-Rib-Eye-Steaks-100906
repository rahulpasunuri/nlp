Yuck. Probably the first recipe from Gourmet that I've tried that didn't come out good. There is way too much salt. I even cut it back to 3 tsp and it was still too much. 1 tsp would probably get the job done.

This makes amazing steaks. I seriously cannot cook, and both times I've tried this I've made steaks better than I've had in many restaurants. I'd second other peoples' advice: use coarse salt (I used ice cream salt), and get it really hot before putting the steaks on.

You'll love these steaks, but this recipe calls for way too much salt--no wonder there were so many complaints. Use a preheated cast iron skillet with 1/2 - to 1 teaspoon KOSHER salt. Table salt won't work for making a crust and neither will non-stick skillets. I even put cracked pepper in with the salt before pre-heating. Please try this again! It's a great way to cook steaks, especially in the winter when the weather isn't good enough to grill outdoors.

Too salty. Had to throw out the steaks.

Delicious, simple, steak. But make sure the pan is HOT - otherwise it will be too salty.

Great way to do steaks!! But do keep in mind the 'three secrets' from below - you'll have no problems.

Their are three secrets to getting these steaks just right: 1) COARSE salt -- I use coarse kosher salt; 2) HOT skillet (I suspect the author was thinking a professional gas range -- on many electric stove tops the maximum heat would be inadequate for this recipe); 3) remember to start the salt in a cold skillet -- it takes a while for the salt to start smoking, and this breaks the salt down. When you hit this recipe just right, the crust seals in ALL of the juices, and it is not salty. A classic!

I've done steaks this way for years, following an old james Beard recipe. The trick of not having them over salty is to have the pan REALLY hot, too cool and the juices flow and dissolve the salt which is what makes them salty.

This recipe was very quick and easy prepare. I followed the recipe to the letter and the steaks came out with a nice golden crust. However, the steaks were too salty for my taste (I used sea salt). I may try the recipe again with less salt.

I did get a crust but this was WAY too salty. I would not make this again.For those who cooked it and liked it maybe you could give us a hint what we are doing wrong?

I made this for my husband for an anniversary and the steaks were absolutely delicious. I have been making steak for this man for 10 years and have never gotten the compliments I received for this one! He pronounced them perfect and said they were better than the steakhouse. I think the key is to use well marbled meat and to get the salt very hot,in order to get the crust. Will definately make my rib-eyes this way from now on!

I also ended up without a crust, but with steak that was way too salty. My kids could not even eat it. I generally salt my steak, but this was way too salty for even me. Was very disappointed, and would never make this again (even if my husband had not requested that I not repeat it!).

I followed this recipe to the letter and instead of ending up with steaks with "a delicious crusty coating", I ended up with two steaks that were all but ruined by the overly salty crust. By choice, I tend to have a bit of a heavy hand with salt when I cook, but these steaks were WAY too salty, even for me. Very disappointing. I would not make this again.

I liked this and so did my husband. It was fast and easy. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes.

Have prepared ribeyes this way for a long time. This is one of my family's favorites.
