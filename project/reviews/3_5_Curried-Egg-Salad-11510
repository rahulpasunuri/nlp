Very good! I added some minced garlic and cilantro for extra punch and used Siriacha hot sauce...yum! Did not have the chutney. Great flavors!

This is the best go-to egg salad recipe ever! I actually do deviled eggs with the recipe. They are always a hit as they are unique & even folks who think they don't like Indian food are impressed. It's nice because you can play with the recipe & get nice variations.

I love curry so had looked at this recipe before. Today a friend gave us 3 DOZEN fresh eggs (yum!) from her free range organic buncha hippy chick hens so I tried it. I used 8 eggs as these were so fresh I knew they wouldn't peel easily. I doubled all the spices, mustard, lemon juice. I didn't have mango chutney but did have a nice ripe mango so minced part of it instead. Put the yolks and the first 7 ingredients into a food processor & made a paste. Stirred in the mango, sliced egg whites, celery & scallion. The bread I used wasn't worthy, honestly. This needs naan or a pita as suggested or to be served on a piece of lettuce or stuffed into a tomato.

I made this when it first appeared in Gourmet in 1991 (boo hoo still miss Gourmet.) I can't believe that was 20 years ago!!! I had ONE hard boiled egg and couldn't let Easter time pass without eating egg salad and was so glad I found this recipe again! I'm eating it now and thinking I was a dope with a whimpy palate or something back then because this is INCREDIBLE!! If people could just taste it there would be 134 reviews instead of just 34. This is so good and I'm not a big celery lover but my ratio with one egg ended up heavy on the celery and it's delicious. As I took my first bite of the sandwich and everything started falling out I thought this would be great in flatbread or naan and then went on to read that the reviewers had already figured that out! Since I was lapping it up it didn't matter :-)

Delicious! It was just a bit too mayonnaise-y for me, so I added a few more eggs. Some chopped cilantro and a splash of soy sauce made this even yummier between a warm pita pocket.

YUM!! I had a lot of leftover eggs from the Passover seder, so I decided to try something different. The flavors are fantastic! Really bright, tangy, and spicy. This is going to taste really good on my passover rolls tomorrow!

Now I make this regularly, especially when eggs are on sale for $0.50/doz. Pita bread is the perfect solution for chunks of egg falling out. Since this recipe is Indian inspired, pita is the closest thing to naan.

Yummy. Really good combination of flavors. I was going to skip the mango chutney and I'm glad I didn't. It really added to the complexity of the flavors. We made sandwiches with a firm crusty bread but the salad fell out. Next time I would put in a pita bread.

excellent, I like a little cumin

Lovely and delicate. I don't like boiled eggs but I wanted to use up the 7 in my fridge. I added 1/4 cup currants to the mayonnaise mix, then added a chopped up mango with the eggs, scallions and celery. It was too good to serve on bread, so I served on romaine lettuce with freshly baked French bread on the side. Mmmmmmmmmm!

Excellent. I added some currants and made sandwiches on curried Naan bread. Even the kids loved it. Will definitely make these again.

Really good twist on egg salad. Skipped the cumin becuase I'm not a fan and skipped on mango chutney because we didn't have any as well as scallions and celery. Added finely chopped white onion. The spice of the onion went great with the curry. Also served on wheat bread with sharp cheddar cheese, and sliced tomato. YUM!

I followed the recipe exactly and what came out was a very liquidy egg salad. The taste was wonderful, but I couldn't serve it to guests.

Used lime, no lemon. Used shallots, no scallions. Didn't have celery salt...used reguler, added currents. All else as directed. Delicious!

I'm pretty much a traditional gal, but this egg salad was interesting so I will make it again. (But it won't hold in a mold so it can't replace my "regular" egg salad recipe.) The mango chutney was VERY IMPT. Took it to a pot luck, and friends said it was the best thing on the table. Disappeared quickly.

This is egg salad is great! I didn't have cumin on hand, but it works without it. The mango chutney adds so much. Will be making again

Excellent dish. This egg salad has enough oomph to stand up to rye bread (I recommend) and will be eaten around our house often. I used light mayo and the dish still tasted absolutely delicious.

This is an amazing recipe! I am already a fan of egg salad, but this recipe makes traditional egg salad seem mundane. I followed the advice of the other users and tweaked the amount of curry, cumin and lemon juice. I think I would hold with the original amount of cumin the next time I make this, but I am still extremely pleased with the outcome.

I've made this to the general ravishment of friends and family. This is elegant egg salad. Based on comments, I agree: increase curry powder, increase celery salt, increase cumin, increase lemon juice, increase chutney. NOTE that the kind of curry powder used greatly influences both the amount needed and the success of the outcome. I prefer a lighter curry powder (I use Pondicherry) to match the eggs; I think a fiery powder (Muchi, for example) is too much.

People who normally don't like egg salad, liked this recipe. I didn't have mango chutney so I used fig preserves instead.

Flavorful and lovely. The mango chutney contributes a special sweetness that completes this creamy salad. I added a bit more curry powder and a small handful of soaked sultaninas (light, fresh raisins), both of which I recommend. Because of my limited kitchen, I had to leave out the cumin, lemon juice and scallions. A little bit of white onion substituted nicely. Versatile and delightful. Grazie! Enjoy it!

Oh wow. I was really nervous about trying this, but it is so good! I forgot to buy scallions, so I used red onion instead and it was fine. I think without them you don't have to have the celery, but it was good too. My only note would be to use MORE chutney. The contrast of it with the traditional mustard and mayo is fantastic!!!!

We used a mixture of Penzey's sweet and hot curry powder...at LEAST twice the amount the recipe calls for. The mango chutney gives it a nice sweet flavour that works well with the spicyness of the curry. I normally don't care for celery, but we diced it very fine and gave it a nice crunch. YUM!

Delicious. I made this recipe to use up the small amount of mango chutney I had left over from ordering in Indian food, and I think this exotic ingredient makes this dish. I dislike celery, so substituted some peeled and seeded cucumber for excellent results. This recipe raises egg salad to a gourmet treat. I don't think it results in 4-6 servings though; a maximum of four is more like it if you've got hungry people on your hands. Bravo!

This was taken to a salad luncheon and received many compliments. I'm not a fan of the outer ribs of celery, so used the inner, more delicate flavored ribs. I stayed with the amount called for in the recipe. The onion amount was not overpowering. I never use celery salt, so don't know if it would have made a difference or not. For added crunch, I put in some honey-roasted almond slices. I almost used toasted, slivered almonds as they are so nice in recipes like this one.

I thought this was delicious. I cut it in half (but used the full amount of celery and scallions) and it made two nice sandwiches for my husband and me on slices of rye bread. It was easy to assemble and used things I had on hand. I will certainly make this again.

This did not thrill me, or my guests. You really need to love curry. I used only half the curry and it still overwhelmed the flavor of the egg salad.

For egg salad, this is about as good as you are going to find. Did not make any changes to the recipe.

I eliminated the celery salt only because I did not have any. I disagree with the other cooks who eliminated the celery. I like egg salad with celery.

I love egg salad, and this was the best ever. The only changes I would make would be to reduce the scallions from three to two, and to eliminate the celery.

This is so yummy! I omitted the celery, as suggested by others, and it was fabu.

This has becoma a family favorite. I have used tamarind chutney in it also. I'm not big on celery, so I left it out, and made my own celery salt with celery seed and kosher salt. I have also added tuna and chicken to it on different occasions, and they work well. As a twist on deviled eggs, I made the dressing, mixed it with the yolks only, and stuffed the whites with it! This is a definite keeper.

Loved this egg salad! It was a big hit with my picnic pals. One suggestion: I'd eliminate the celery. The crunch is nice, but the subtle bitterness of it competed with the lovely flavors of everything else.

Found this recipe while looking for something new with egg salad that could be taken on a picnic-type lunch. This was quick, easy to make, and I had all the ingredients on hand (yes, even mango chutney). It must sit for a few hours for the flavors to blend, though! The only thing I added was sliced almonds. Even my 2 year old son keeps wanting more of it! Definitely a keeper--I don't think I will ever make regular egg salad again!

This was excellent - not too strong or spicy, but plenty flavorful. I skipped the celery and added an extra couple of hard-boiled eggs, and everyone (with a varying degree of tastes) was pleased.

I have been making a Curried Egg Salad for years, so I was very interested to find a recipe as mine was just made up. The combination of mustard, chutney, lemon juice etc. works really well. I layered the salad, starting with the egg and then sundried tomatoes, followed by scallions, celery and a Granny Smith Apple. I then poured the dressing over the salad and topped with tasty grated cheese and freshly chopped parsley. Delicious and looks fantastic.

Excellent! I used only 1 scallion because that looked like plenty. Aside from that, I can't think of anything I'd want to change (not that I actually tried 3). I finally found mango chutney at Trader Joe's and Cost Plus, after I had made this recipe.

I am not usually an egg salad fan, but this is the best. Any curry fan would enjoy this recipe. I had tomato chutney on hand the first time, and liked it so well, continue to use it. My tastebuds prefer too much celery, extra mustard and tobasco. In place of scallions, I have used leeks and vidalia onions, and both were nice variations. It was a pleasant surprise of a recipe.
