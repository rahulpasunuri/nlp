Delicious--and great for breakfast or dinner. Any cheese of your choice could work--so long as it melts well. I used Emmentaler--yum.

I first made this recipe in 1999, after purchasing the magazine. The salt measurement is definitely a typo. For those that consider them under seasoned: they are meant to sop up the flavors of the food served with them.

Too much liquid. Be careful about what kind of cornmeal you use - I think next time I will scrap the flour/cornmeal and just add a cup of corn flour. Alternatively I might cook the polenta I bought and use it after it has been partially cooked. I added green onion, cilantro, and chili powder and didn't taste any of it. Add the milk at the very end to taste. You'll use only 3 ears of corn.

Loved these savory little pancakes. The salt measurement is definitely an error. I used 2 tsp. and it was just right. The leftovers freeze very well and can simply be reheated in a 350 degree oven in a single layer.

Easy and tasty - a nice and different way to have corn. It's winter here so we used frozen corn kernels and cheddar cheese (were trying to use it up) and we served it with the chimichurri sauce ..... MMMMMM! A really nice change from our ususal fare.

Easy to make and a nice side dish. I substituted feta for mozzarella, and yogurt for milk.

I've made this recipe exactly as written twice, and I wouldn't change a thing! Delicious with steak on the grill and chimichurri sauce. I am a big fan of "make ahead" items and while these are really good re-warmed, they are really GREAT right out of the pan. By the way, I'm sure these don't taste as great as Colombian arepas--that's why the recipe says arepas were the "inspiration" for this dish. I'll take what I can get. Make these!!!

These no way taste like the Colombian arepas I have eaten!! The corn that is used in the native countries is different and not as sweet or tender.

We very much liked the results of these delicious polenta-like cakes. I did cut back on the salt and substituted jack cheese for the mozzerella. They were yummy--crispy on the outside and delicate on the inside. I also paired it with the sauce they recommend with it and grilled up some chicken (marinated in the sauce). It a fun and fairly simple dish to make.

I left out the cheese and cut way down on the salt. I also used white corn and white corn meal instead of yellow. I served these with black bean chili and queso fresco. I topped them with cilantro, diced tomato, onion and avocado. Everyone loved them so much, that I've acutally made them twice in a week.

I made some changes to this recipe and really like the result better than the original. I used jack cheese and roasted the corn on the grill before taking off the cob. I liked them sauteed in butter and then reheated in a slow oven. I served them with herb-grilled rack of lamb.

My son suggested adding fresh jalepenos would at least give it a bit of flavor.

A waste of good ingredients, way to much salt.
