uugghh! I love all of these flavors separately, but this did not work. The rosemary was overpowering.

Loved it. Rosemary kicked butt. I added roasted pine nuts, went heavier on the cheese and used brandy instead of port. I used fancy pears too, maybe follette?

Made this for dessert for my parents who aren't big sweet eaters. In the trail run, I peeled the pears. They held up much better with the skins. Roasting time varies based on the ripeness of the pears. If you have very ripe pears, they'll be mush after 20 minutes. All in all, a classic combination of flavors and a keeper for an easy, yet tasty, dessert.

Desert for 25...this recipe is simple and fabulous. Make sure you get soft pears, mine were a little tough, and took longer to bake, but the end result was well worth it. I bought the port, but forgot to use it. but served with vanilla ice cream and 2 different drizzles for presentation - chocolate Raspberry & coffee caramel. Will definitely keep this in the recipe box!

My husband made this with our dinner the other night and we both thought it was fabulous. We have other good pear with gorgonzola recipes, but this one is now my favorite. Will definitely make again.

This is a sophisticated, easy and delicious dish. We served it as a light dessert, though it would work well as a first course as well. Everyone at the dinner party (well, except our 7 year old, of course) enjoyed the combination of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly with complete success. Will make this one again!

One of my favorite simple desserts. The brown sugar carmelized with the rosemary is wonderful and the gorgonzola is nicely balanced by the sweetness of the port. If you are not a fan of any of the ingredients, however, I would not recommend this one.

This was so simple to prepare and had very lovely flavors. I served it with leftover turkey with port gravy (also from this website) and they matched beautifully. I noted a slight bitter aftertaste, and it may have been because the fresh rosemary was cooked too long. Fresh rosemary has a tendancy to get bitter when cooked too long. Next time, I will sprinkle it on halfway through baking. Make sure to use good port since it is poured on at the end and not cooked. If all your ingredients are good and fresh, this should work out well.

Wow. Really different flavor combination, interesting and delicious. Served as dessert to company. One husband told his wife to get the recipe.

Ewww. I was so excited to try these as a side dish with a turkey dinner and they were just bad.

We had a last minute guest for dinner and had all these ingredients in the house. What a scrumptious and simple dessert. Very impressive for presentation along with a simple cake such as banana bread or a plain cookie.

The flavors really are intense. I don't care for blue cheese, so I think I'll have to substitute another cheese (smoked gouda?) next time. It was a little too intense for me.

This has become a favorite, as dessert or even as a side with roast pork. The flavors are so intense, and perfect together. Even my husband, who doesn't like blue cheese and won't drink port, likes them in this dish. And it takes only a few minutes to prepare!
