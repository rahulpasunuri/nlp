I loved this recipe but I wanted a greater contrast between the orange and choc. so I used a few drops of high quality orange extract and zest of a whole orange to make it more fresh tasting. An excellent, moist brownie. I really loved the combo of tangy orange and sweet chocolate. The key - as in every recipe - is quality ingredients. Use a great orange, high quality chocoate and you will love this!!

This was not up to par with the other cheesecake recipes that I have done. I will probably do this again but double the the cheescake part since the brownie really overpowers the cheesecake

I agree with those who found these brownies to be just 'okay.' There are better brownie recipes out there. The cheesecake portion was pretty good and I'd use that again (I made mine "non-orange" by leaving out the orange zest and substituting 1/2 t. vanilla). I found that the batters spread really thin in a 9" pan, resulting in a pretty darn flat brownie. I'd recommend using an 8" pan, watching the baking time. These taste better chilled but, again, they're just okay in my opinion.

Astonishingly easy and big success at a party. You don't even need a mix master- just a few bowls and a good spoon.

I added Grand Marnier to the cheesecake batter, and increased the orange zest. Served the brownies slightly chilled and in small bites as part of a large buffet. All were eaten!

O.K., not great. I followed others' suggestions, added the grated peel of a whole orange and layered instead of swirled.

I loved these brownies! I made them for my writing group and they were a great success. I swirled and loved swirling. I thought the orange was just enough. The best part was the brownie-very fudgie-just like Gourmet said it would be.

This recipe was simply 'okay' in my opinion. I used the zezt of one large navel orange, so I'm sure it was more than what was called for in the recipe. I think I might try making my favorite brownie recipe and then using the orange cheesecake part of this recipe, as the brownie part of the recipe isn't as good as the one I make. I also think layering is a better idea than swirling. Also, I think I'll try doubling the cheesecake portion of the recipe, as I too thought the brownies overpowered the cheesecake part. Overall, not a bad recipe, just was expecting better.

This was a great success! Instead of fresh orange zest, I used candied orange peel I made. It came out perfect. I also layered the cheesecake part. It looked good when cut, too. I will definitely bake this again.

These brownies weren't bad, as brownies go, but I wouldn't rate them as high as others I have tried. Could not taste the orange in them very much and I put more than 3/4 teaspoon of orange peel in the recipe. Just a so-so brownie.

I also doubled this and baked it in a 11x13 baking dish at 325 for about 45 minutes in my convection oven. I brought the brownies to a party and everyone loved them. They are more orange-y tasting than you'd expect, so they are different from a standard brownie. The only caveat I have is that I found that my batters did not swirl as nicely as I expected (both batters were quite thick). I will make these again, but will keep the layers separate.

I doubled the recipe and instead of swirling the cheesecake mixture, I was able to spread it on top of the brownie mixture. Everyone LOVED it! This will replace my previous favorite brownie recipe! :o)

I truly enjoyed this recipe. The orange flavor in the cream cheese was a wonderful touch. I brought them to my work and everyone loved them. Being the chocaholic that I am, I did add about an ounce more of semi sweet chocolate to the recipe.

This makes a nice addition to a holiday party platter of desserts.

I brought these brownies to both a picnic and a potluck dinner and they were quickly devoured both times. If you love chocolate and cheesecake, this is a real winner. The flavors are so seductive together and the orange is not overpowering and really works! My only correction that I would try next time is to increase the proportion of cheesecake to brownie; I think that the recipe could've handled more cheesecake.
