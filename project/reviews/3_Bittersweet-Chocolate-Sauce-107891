I agree with the prior reviewer that this was too sweet, even though I reduced the amount of sugar . I added an ounce of unsweetened baker's chocolate (i had doubled the recipe) and it thickened a bit more and took the edge off the sweetness (also added a bit of vanilla as I like the flavor of vanilla with chocolate. The recipe is good because it doesn't have a lot of butter and cream - two ingredients that add a lot of heaviness even though they enhance the texture. I served it with a ginger cake and it was a good match.

I was looking for a chocolate sauce for a friend who doesn't eat dairy. The texture is great. I thought is was too sweet, so I added more cocoa powder and water, also added brandy and the taste was superb. Served with espresso angel food cake and received lots of compliments.
