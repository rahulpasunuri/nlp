I made this for a dinner party together with the whole menu that it apeared with (Ruth Reichl's favorites I think). The granita needs to be made a day in advance but it is very simple to make and makes a wonderful and unusual condiment. Everyone else liked it too- (even people who were skeptical of eating raw oysters in the first place).
