Very generic. I read all the reviews and decided to make the recipe as it is written. My kids liked them "ok" but it is very "basic" tasting.

I didn't change much in this recipe and it turned out delicious! I did add 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of raisins. I also baked some as mini muffins for my toddlers (14 minutes worked perfectly) and the rest as large muffins. They were a big hit with my kids so we will make them again.

Delicious and so sweet, they border on cupcakes. I would cut the brown sugar in half.

I feel like these lack maple flavor. I will follow another reviewer's suggestion and put in maple extract (in addition to the maple syrup) next time. These are okay, but they taste like brown sugar and cinnamon muffins, not maple muffins.

I made several changes recommended by other reviewers, but I was still disappointed with these. I found them very bland and a bit too heavy. In all fairness, I subbed out half the flour for whole wheat pastry flour, but even without that, I was unimpressed. I threw in raisins, craisins, blueberries and chopped apple, and the tops were pretty good. By the bottom of the muffin they were way too dry, even with 2 eggs and buttermilk. I may still try them again with some changes, but as is, they weren't great.

This was a really yummy recipe! Its better when its cooled a bit cause all the flavours come out. Not really a fan of maple, so I substituted with honey and corn syrup at about 1:3. Everybody loved it; moist and tasty, no melted butter and simple ingredients, will make again.

Yummy with using half wheat flower and reducing sugar slightly, but adding a sprinkle of raw sugar for topping. Adding chopped pecans and consider adding dried fruit too.

Instead of 2 cups white flour, used 1 cup white & 1 cup whole wheat, and added diced prunes and chopped walnuts - these were moist and delicious, with a nice chewy texture. No need to use paper liners in my Calphalon non-stick muffin pan, but did use a bit of canola spray just to be sure they wouldn't stick. Had a bit of batter left over after filling all 12 tins to the top, so used the rest for a tiny loaf. Baked for just 20 minutes on convect - perfect!

I too made adjustments: half spelt flour, half whole-wheat, 2 over-ripe bananas instead of apple sauce, grated ginger, walnuts, and 1 cup cooked and cooled steel-cut oats instead of rolled, leftover from breakfast. Fantastic texture, moist, flavourful, will add more fresh maple syrup next time though.

These muffins are wonderful. I made them gluten-free with a few changes. First, I substituted half of the flour for whole grain millet flour and the other half for my gluten-free flour blend (white rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch flour, i.e. the classic "Bette Hagman blend" that we refer to in the GF baking community). Millet flour is very tasty and healthy. It contains protein, esential amino acids, and fiber. Try it. Wheat flour is not good for you. I also added one teaspoon xanthum gum to the dry mix. This helps to bind with the absence of gluten. Also, I put the oats in my Cuisinart and ground them into oat flour because I wanted a more delicate texture to the muffin. I found it necessary to bake them for only 25 minutes

I made this as is, and thought it was very good, for low fat. I tossed some walnuts with brown sugar, oats and maple syrup for a quick strusel that tasted awesome. Next time, the only changes I make will be to go 1/2 and 1/2 whole wheat and white flour, and add in some wheat germ and diced apples.

Hmm, I seem to be the only one to have made this close to the original. I've been making these for about five years now and love them. Sometimes I add some toasted pecans. I always add lots of cinnamon, and sometimes I sub balkan style yogurt thinned with a little milk for the buttermilk. They've always been delicious.

Like most, I made several changes: 1/2 whole wheat flour, sweet potato puree instead of applesauce, 3tsp cinnamon (could have used more still), regular milk, was a little short on the pure, grade B maple syrup so added 1/4 C dark brown sugar, was also short on light brown sugar so used some white, and added a 2nd egg. The batter tasted amazing but the muffins weren't quite as flavorful. Maybe the buttermilk would have made a big difference, although I did try adding 1 tsp white vinegar as suggested by another reviewer. My 3yo seems to like them fine - she doesn't "do" raisins or anything in her muffins, so these work.

I forgot the brown sugar and these were great anyway! They don't taste overly healthy and were a hit with my anti-healthy hubby!

again, some serious moderations resulted in a delish muffin. increase the cinnamon and vanilla, use half whole wheat flour, 2 eggs and some other interesting additions- i added wild blueberries, dried currants, and chopped pecans. YUM! do the buttermilk (it adds a nice flavor) by adding a tsp. of white vinegar to reg milk if you don't have buttermilk on hand.

This is funny. I think all the reviews are of altered recipes, not this one exactly, so I decided to have fun with it too, and it worked out great. I added some maple extract, used a combination of applesauce and pureed butternut squash, added some milled flax seed and wheat germ, used whole milk instead of buttermilk, an extra egg, some extra whole wheat flour, and raisins. Yummy, moist, flavorful, nutritious, and with a breakfast muffin, I'm getting squash into my son and he loves them.

Gourmet muffins are gourmet because they are filled with stuff!!!!!!. These were rich, filling, low fat, delicious after I: replaced buttermilk with 3/4 cup non-fat sour cream, replaced maple syrup with 3 overipe bananas, increased to 3 tsps both cinnamon and vanilla, increased brown sugar, added fresh apples, dried apricots, cranberries, walnuts, and added a streusal top of brown sugar,oats and walnuts, which produces a caramelized crunchy, nutty top. Enjoy!

Very good if you make all of the suggested modifications. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 4 teaspoons of cin., 1 teaspoon nutmeg, diced apples, and walnuts.

This recipe definately needs more of something. It smells absolutely delicious, but the taste winds up being pretty bland. I took one reader's suggestion and added chopped apple to the mix, but next I'm going to try adding some brown sugar, much more cinnamon, a little nutmeg, and either walnuts or pecans.

Rating: 2
I took the suggestion of using pumpkin instead of applesauce. I increased the sugar a bit and added some spices (i think it was cinnamon and nutmeg). My roommate liked them a lot and asked for the recipe. I thought they were good and a satisfying breakfast paired with a glass of milk (and maybe a little nutella on top)

There's always going to be something missing in a low fat muffin. To those cutting back on flour, if you do that you're just shrinking the yield and increasing the fat per muffin. A good suggestion as seen below is add nutmeg and pieces of apple. I also used half brown sugar and half fructose - fructose has same calories as sugar, but is much sweeter - so it tastes like there is more sugar.

These are delicious. To those who would eliminate the buttermilk, buttermilk is what neutralizes the baking soda to provide additional levening and is vital for a tender, yet fluffy muffin. The only main chage I made was to soak my oatmeal in the buttermilk for about 20 minutes, since I only had extra thick rolled oats on hand. Subbing sour cream for applesauce will create a denser muffin, if that is desired, but in that case you're probably better off using an oatmeal scone recipe with some maple flavoring and cutting back on the fat you add.

I added a bit some maple extract based on other's suggestions. I also added maple flavour quick cook oatmeal (of the breakfast variety). I love these muffins and have finally found a substitute for Starbucks Oat Maple Scones (not of the low fat variety)

Blech! Muffins were taseless and had an awful texture.

I wanted a more pronounced maple flavor, so I substituted in 1/2 a teaspoon of maple extract, for 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla (still using 1 1/2 t vanilla). I didn't have any sugar-free applesauce on hand, so I cut back a little on the brown sugar. These muffins came out beautiful and tasty. I brought 4 different types of muffins from this site to a function, and these all went quickly.

What a great recipe. I would suggest making it with Canadian Maple Bacon to complete the maple affect.

These muffins are moist and fabulous if you make the following simple substitutions: use only 1 cup flour, use 1 mashed banana instead of apple sauce, reduce the oil to 1/8 cup, and use 1/2 cup low fat sour cream mixed with 1/2 cup skim milk in place of the buttermilk. Mixing in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts is also a great idea. Delicious!!

I think I found the PERFECT low fat muffin recipe. Followed recipe except for these changes: sed soymilk, instead of buttermilk and only ONE cup whole wheat pastry flour instead of 2 cups all-purpose; soaked oats in in milk for about 20 minutes, used only 1/8 cup of oil, omitted salt & added 1 cup blueberries! Super moist, sweet and taste GREAT like the local muffin bakery!

These muffins were fine, especially considering how little fat you use in making them. My one complaint--stirring until just mixed meant that I had some flour lumps in the finished product. Yuck!

I thought this recipe was good as-is. It's worth finding grade B maple syrup to use in this recipe, as it defintely intensifies the flavor.

Rating: 3
I made a few major substitutions. First, I used 3/4 cup of packed pumpkin instead of the applesauce. In line with that choice, I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and pumpkin pie spice. Also, I cut back about 1/2 c. to 1/3 c. of the flour to make the muffins more moist. They turned out great...if making the pumpkin substitution, adding more brown sugar might be a good idea (by at least 1/4 c.)

Using low-fat sour cream for the buttermilk makes these very moist. My kids think they have a coffee cake texture. Using 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour works great. Substituting granola for the oatmeal - the Bon Appetit Peach Parfait with Maple Granola kind and omitting the maple syrup makes these much heartier and more like a muffin.

Everyone else said this recipe was bland, so I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and one grated apple (sans peel and seeds, of course!), and it was delicious. I definitely recommend it

Followed suggestion regarding reducing apple sauce and increasing oil. Muffins came out quite good, but could still be moister. Could be my fault - left them in the oven a little too long. Family gobbled muffins right up.

A tasty muffin. Could do with a little more syrup to get the maple taste.

The flavour was excellent, but I wasn't completely happy with the texture (as is often the case with low-fat muffins). I think next time I'll increase the oil just a little and reduce the apple sauce accordingly.
