I made these for Easter. Everyone liked them, but they were too sweet for the dinner meal. It's difficult to shape the bunny given the written directions. The bunny is 3 dimensional- form an egg shape out of the dough and lay it on it's side. The bunny is sitting with it's tummy on the ground. The narrow end of the egg is the head and the wide end is the tail. The ears are cut into the egg shape along each side of the bunny. They don't come away from the body. I wish I would have known this prior to making this recipe. I gave up on the bunnies and just made mine round.

To avoid burning the glaze, bake for 17 min on a silpat mat (opt) and in the top half of the oven. Also, important, put an empty cold/room temp pan underneath as a heat cushion for the bottoms which do want to burn. Look in the 1995 April Gourmet (pg. 141-142) for the recipie and a drawing of how to form the bunnies.

I made these about 13 years ago when the reciupe was published and my family is still talking about them. They looked and tasted great.

Maybe I did something wrong, but these were AWFUL. The dough was dry and never reached a smooth, elastic stage. Therefore, my bunnies definitely never looked like bunnies and they certainly didn't taste very good either. My sister didn't care for the sweet glazed part and commented that the inside part was interesting and tasted kind of like a pretzel. They were dense and just kind of odd. After having such success with the cloverleaf rolls on this site, I am quite disappointed by the results of these rolls. Any ideas as to what might have been the problem?

I just finished making these; they're soooo good. I would suggest baking just one pan in the middle of the oven; one of my pans got a little toasty on the bottom, but still are delicious! I shaped mine into hearts which worked out ok....I think using a cutter instead of hand shaping would have been better though. I pondered splitting the recipe as I only had one egg on hand, but went ahead with the whole one substiuting a little half+half for the second yolk and they seem just fine.

We make this recipe every Easter at my house (ever since it first appeared). The buns are so delicious, they could almost replace dessert. To keep them from burning, we've found that an air cushion baking sheet does the trick.

These rolls are very tender and delicious, plus they are just so cute! I am making them again this year!

I love this recipe and have made it every year since it first appeared in Gourmet. The glaze is so delicious - real butter is a must. It even worked when i lived in Africa and couldn't find my original recipe - i simply used a sweet roll dough. It tend to be a bit dry; I live in Denver. Any suggestions on making it a bit moister?

I made these rolls for Easter 2001, and they were tasty, but I had to watch them carefully so they didn't burn. Also, quite a few of them ended up looking more like deformed aliens than bunny rabbits. However, the guests liked them - and had fun deciding who among the guests most closely resembled the most deformed bunny rolls...

These were delicious. I found the instructions about how to shape the bunnies to be confusing, and I ended up making my own bunny shape.

It's not Easter at our house without these. They are sweet to look at and sweet to eat. Friends beg me for the recipe. I've never had trouble with the glaze burning. I use a pastry brush and lightly brush them so none will drip off. I also avoid getting any on the bottom. Yes, the article in the magazine did have an illustration showing how to shape them. I'll try to explain. Form the rolls into egg shapes. The small end will be the bunny's face. Take your shears and snip a small flap ,coming down from above, on back of the fat end. This flap will fold down and be the bunny's tail. Turn the egg so that the small end is facing away from you. Snip two long flaps on the upper part of either side running from about the middle to almost the front. Don't cut all the way trough to the end. These two flaps will be the bunnys ears. Make two small holes in the front of the small end and press in two currents for eyes. Make sure you push them in at least half way or they will fall out. When they finish rising, it will look like a plump little floppy eared rabbit lying on his stomach.

Haven't made this recipe yet but want to. The directions to make the ears and tail are confusing. Can any of you who have made these rolls give a clearer explanation?

Very good recipe, but needs a little adjusting. * The directions to make the bunny tail are confusing. The rolls also rose a lot, and looked like very bloated bunnies, or possibly turkeys. Consider chopping the dough into more than 12 rolls. * They always burn on the bottom. Experimenting with lower temp. * Baking with the glaze was a smoking disaster. It immediately ran onto the pan and burnt. I'm experimenting with using melted butter instead, then adding some glaze during the last 5-10 minutes of baking. I've tried three batches, and will make them again.

This recipe has become a family tradition for Easter. Last year I lost the recipe and spent hours looking for it. The recipe sound complicated but it isn't the instructions to cut the Bunnies does not make sense. The original has a picture which makes it easier.

These rolls have become a tradition at our Easter dinner. They are visually appealing and the taste is wonderful. It is a little time consuming to form the bunny shapes -- if I'm in a hurry, I skip that step. They are richer/sweeter than a typical dinner roll.

Addorable bunnies. The glaze burned in the oven and was a mess. I'll make again with out the glaze - just use an egg wash instead. I'll add a glaze (from hot cross buns) after they've cooled.

This is a very good recipe. Just remember to allow ample time for rising. The bunnies were especially cute- great for getting fussy kids to eat more at the easter table!
