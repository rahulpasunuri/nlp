This was a fun addition to a cocktail party spread I made for a NYE party. It's particularly nice for entertaining because it can be made in advance. I added a bit more horseradish and used a vegetarian broth.

This was a nice change of pace from a heavy hors'd.and fun to serve. I did tweak the basic recipe though as I thought the soup was a little bland. I added, like other users, a ton more vodka, more worcestershire, lemon juice and I used some hot horseradish. If using regular horse radish I would add some tabasco. I also threw in a couple of stocks of regular celery and some cilantro. I used the shrimp, an olive and a pickeled cocktail onion.

Doubled the recipe for large holiday party. Served in shot glasses with large cooked shrimp hung over edge of each glass. Added a little extra horseradish for more kick, and also tossed in a bit more vodka. Better if you make the day before. Also recommend having help for the party (Hired teenage daughter and friend to keep cleaned & refilled glasses coming!) Big hit.

This was the big hit of our Christmas dinner for 12. The recipe at it's core is great - I added a bit more horseradish and 3-4x the vodka. Since the main event is the "soup" (ahem), we just used frozen shrimp and that was fine, embellished with the pickled veggie and a chunk of celery. Next time I would probably skip the veggie, but it did add some different color and texture. If you really serve them in shot glasses you'll have lots left over for bloody mary's the next morning, which we did on Boxing Day! Can't wait to make them again.

If you like bloody marys, this is a great hors d'oeuvre. It's really great for making ahead and then quickly assembling it for guests. I thought the "soup" was salty enough without the celery salt, so instead I blended in a stalk of fresh celery, which gave a nice richness to the flavor and some subtle crunch to the soup. And I used a small piece of celery instead of pickled vegetables on the toothpick with the shrimp. And definitely doubled the vodka! :)

This was awful. Made it for Christmas Eve, most of my guests looked like they were drinking it to be polite. It was overly salty and flat tasting at the same time.

This appetizer is perfect for any kind of elegant bash where you're looking for ease and presentation at the same time. I add plenty of vodka to this recipe to make them legit bloody mary shots, and people LOVE them. I also leave out the pickled veggies and add sprig of celery and minced cilantro instead.

I forgo the shot glass presentation-as pretty as it may be-and instead just double the recipe and serve a tasty mid day meal! A liquid lunch, without the guilt.

Served this New Year's Eve at a dinner party for 8. Very festive and delicious. Not hard by any means but I was thinking of making it super easy by just doing a pre- made good Bloody Mary Mix with a splash of Vodka and doing the garnish. I think it would be just as fun and not much different. I served this in a collection of shot glasses I buy on vacations - - people enjoyed seeing where their glass was from.

This is very easy to make and it is delicious. The perfect blend of flavours that is almost a bloody mary. I think we will make this for regular meals and not just for parties.

Outstanding little refreshment! I had little paper umbrella picks on which I put pickled asparagus, olives and shrimp. Very tasty and festive!
