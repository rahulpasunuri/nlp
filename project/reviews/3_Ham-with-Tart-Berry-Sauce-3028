It's tart all right. Too tart. Do not want.

My boyfriend liked this quite a lot (hence the three forks), I thought it was just OK. If I make it again it will definitely have a little less mustard, I felt like that taste just took over the dish and flavors didn't really blend.

I doubled the sauce except I used a little less dry mustard. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't serve it with ham at all, but with sauteed pork medallions. Wow, was this delicious. My guest felt 4 forks would be in order, and I'm inclined to agree, except "a dish beyond compare" is something I can rarely state.

The topping on the ham was delicious. This is a very easy to prepare recipe that my girlfriend loved. I made it with cranberries instead of lingenberries. I didn't have a pepper-mill, so I ground the pepper myself. That's the only thing I will do differently next time. Less coarse pepper and peppered on both sides and this will be an exquisite dish.

This is a quick, easy, tasty dish. My husband, who says he doesn't like ham or mustard, liked it. Don't be scared off by the amount of dry mustard, it is not overpowering. Next time, I think I'll try this sauce on game hens.

This was a great tasting & simple to prepare recipe! This was a nice change to how I normally prepare a ham steak (apple juice, mustard, brown sugar & madiera wine). I will now use both recipes. If you like this recipe than also try the Pork Tenderloin with Balsamic Cranberry Sauce that is often on the most reviewed list. They are very similar.

Terrific, very tasty and quick. I didn't have any shallots so used red onion which did very well. Served steamed, buttered nutmeg carrots and yukon gold dilled potatoes. Nice green salad with vidalia onion dressing topped it all off. No left overs tonight!
