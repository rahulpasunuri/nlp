This is a very delicious recipe,quick and easy to make, but personally I think that it should have more than one apple added to it in order to offset the slightly slippery texture of the seaweed.

Is really good. Made it by recipe so I could rate it. Will change it a little. I want to change the apple to red bell pepper and add some hot. Serving it with grilled tuna.Yum!

To make this more of a hearty dish I added 16 oz. of wild rice and doubled the rest of the recipe. It was a smashing success! Initally, I was planning on serving it chilled, but in the intrest of time I served it right after it was assembled and it was warm - so delicious. I've made it twice in the past two weeks for different potlucks and everyone raved.

This was a great salad, just the thing to serve with poached salmon! I always love ordering seaweed salad at Asian restaurants & it's great to know you can make it super fast at home (cheap too!) Here's the link for another recipe for a delicious seaweed salad that's beyond easy to make! http://hotandhealthyliving.com/2010/07/how-to-make-asian-seaweed-salad/

i combined kombu, arame & wakame & quadrupled the marinade. i also added a couple of serrano peppers with the seeds removed & roasted the garlic first because raw garlic is difficult for me to digest. i also added several tabelspoons of togarashi (japanese 7 spice) and used black rice vinegar instead & chili-infused sesame oil. this was my second time making this and i left out the apples this time. no need. tofu squards would be better. this is EXCELLENT.

The marinade for this recipe was perfect, but the salad itself wasn't exactly what I was looking for. My local natural foods store only had one kind of Wakame (organic, uncut, unprepared), which needed to be soaked for 12 hours (or cooked) and then cut into strips. The process was fairly labor intensive, but I didn't mind it too much. My major problem is that the Wakame didn't resemble the thin, slightly crunchy strands of Wakame normally present in seaweed salads. After doing a bit of research I discovered that the seaweed salad served in Japanese restaurants is made from Wakame *stems* (not fronds, which are much easier to find in stores) and Agar. (The rest of the recipe is virtually the same.) I am going to hunt down Wakame stems and try the recipe again with the inclusion of Agar.

I tasted this recipe at a restaurant I went to and tried making it at home. It came out soooo good. The only thing I did different instead of apples I used cucumbers and it's marvelous

I'm not sure why no one else had this problem, but the wakame I bought said it had to be cooked and, following this recipe, I didn't do that. It turned out very tough, with ribs in it that needed to be cut out. Other than that, the recipe seemed delicious, and seaweed is UNBELIEVABLY good for you. Just a heads-up: read the package for the wakame you buy and see if it needs to be cooked first. I'm planning on trying again.

Used the first 7 ingredients and cilantro for garnish. Turned out exactly like the seaweed dimsum served in dimsum / yumcha places. Its extraordinarily simple and very flavorful. I served it as a tiny accompaniment. Perfect in small portions.

The recipe is far too tart and lacks a depth of flavor that most other nori dishes have.

It tasted OK, but still has distance from the one I had from restaurant. But I would recommend this receipt for beginner because it is very easy and affordable to make.

It came out much better than I was expecting. I scooped some floating seaweed on the Maine shore this afternoon and used this recipe. Great accompaniment to edamame appetizer and pasta dish with fresh herbs, tomato & garlic. Next time I'll pick up more seaweed... I threw a lot in the garden to enrich it as well.

I love seaweed salad and this recipe was so easy and right on the money with the flavors. I recommend triple washing the seaweed if you get the salted variety.

My Korean mother has made a similar salad (sometimes using spinach) so I grew up eating seaweed. The cilantro and apples are a new additions to me and when I eat this salad with brown rice, I call it "new Korean" cuisine- yum!

i love this recipe because I always have the ingredients on hand. Its delicious too, although I do omit the apples!

This is very good - I've made it three times already. I don't add the apples though since I don't like them in salads as a rule anyway. I make a batch and use it for lunches. Add lots of sesame and tofu doesn't hurt either.

Excellent! I prefer a little less apple but all the other ingredients were perfect as measured!
