Incredible!!! I omitted the cinnamon and ground ginger. The cake came out perfectly and a huge success. No problems at all making it for thanksgiving this year!

I LOVE this cake. I have had absolutely rave compliments on it every time I make it. I even had a pastry chef ask me for the recipe. I typically have split this cake into only two layers, and have found that works great. I butter and flour the pans before baking, and so far, I haven't had a disaster yet. Sometimes one of the layers does crack a bit, but I have always been able to fix it enough to look pretty with frosting. I don't use the strawberry sauce, but I have used berries to decorate the top. Also, if I am in a rush, I have used store bought whipped frosting; that serves as an adequate substitute.

Love this cake!! It's a favorite...have made it many times. If any crunch sticks...just place it back into the bare spots on the cake while still warm. No problem. It is beautiful, different and delicious!! This one is a keeper!!

San Jose, Try lining the pans with oiled parchment prior to layering in the crunch topping.

Everyone loves this cake and it is beautiful if it works out. I have made this cake about 4 or 5 times and it is never a sure thing. I have difficulty getting the layers out of the pans without losing part of the topping and some of the layers will have cracks on the top. I just pray for one layer to come out intact for the top of the cake. Then the next problem I have is cake layers will stick to the parchment paper after they have cooled. I am considering freezing the layers to make removal of the parchment easier. In the past if I don't have an perfect top layer I frost the entire cake. If anyone has solved these problem please let me know.

I made this for Easter. Great taste, although I agree the strawberry sauce isn't necessary. (But it was useful with the excellent mascarpone cheesecake I also made from this site.) Would definitely make it again.

Terrific recipe - easy to make and the crunch adds a very different element. We're gingerholics, so I tripled the ginger and added a couple heaping tablespoons of ginger preserves. Also added crystallized ginger to the whipped cream. If I were to change anything I would use a lighter molasses - I used blackstrap and it was a tad strong. Overall delicious, easy cake.

This cake is fantastic, and is very forgiving of substitutions. I was looking for something to take to a party and didn't want to go to the grocery store for ingredients. I decided to double it when I realized it really wouldn't be big enough, then I ran out of molasses and used sorghum. No pecans (was sure I had some in freezer), so I used toasted blanched almonds and sunflower seeds in the crunch. Oops! No buttermilk, so I used kefir. All of the reviews said it was hard to get out of pan, so I put just a little of the crunch in the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan, put cake in oven for 10 minutes to form a "skin" so crunch put on top wouldn't sink (not sure if I had to do that, but it worked), and then put the rest of the crunch on top. Final adjustment - I used strawberries in topping but added lots of wild blackberries from the edge of the woods near my house. So I'm not sure it's the same cake, but it was darned good, got rave reviews, and now I have to cobble together my version in writing so that I can pass out the recipe to all who asked for it.

Yummy. The taste of molasses was overwhelming, though it was somewhat neutralized by generous amounts of whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Still, I'd reduce the amount of molasses next time..perhaps to about half. Cake stuck to the parchment paper on cooling rack. Because of this, it cracked into pieces, so the final product wasn't as pretty as it could've been. Will do without parchment paper next time. Might also skip the layering next time and just use dessert glasses, and alternate layers of whipped cream with the cake, and pour the strawberry sauce on top.

I made this cake for Easter and it was such a huge hit! My bother that doesn't eat cake had two helpings. The sauce was a great addition. It's not too sweet which is why everyone loved it so much. It really doesn't take that long to make. I probably wouldn't use the wax paper next time because the cake stuck to it, but other than that it's a wonderful recipe.

Everyone who tasted this loved it. I personally don't think it needs the strawberry sauce, but it makes an interesting combination of flavors. Didn't use all the whipped cream, because I didn't put enough between layers...may use all next time. Had trouble getting out of nonstick pans--will use parchment next time. Also had cake stick to waxed paper. Will try to cool on rack next time. Overall, delicious, unusual and beautiful.

Made this for Easter and it was a huge hit with the family and also with my co-workers when I brought some in the next day. I usually go for chocolate-based desserts, but I don't miss it at all with this cake. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the last application of whipped cream as I couldn't tell why it was necessary and I had extra from the first batch which I just served alongside.

This cake was a huge success, despite looking a little dishevled. The cake layers stuck to the waxed paper after cooling, and I'm not sure why. No one else mentioned having this problem, so I have to assume it is something I did. Any solutions? Fresh strawberries weren't available so I pureed sweetened frozen strawberries and covered the top of the cake with whipped cream. The only thing I would do differently is make just 2 layers.

This cake was so simple to make and so delicious! I loved the texture of the cake - did not rise very much and it came out dense and chewy. WOW! I served it for a birthday dinner - everyone loved it.

This cake is AWESOME. It does come out with a "heavier" taste and texture...denser, darker, spicey. but absolutely divine, especially with the whipped cream and strawberries. Mine also needed more time in the oven(5-10 min), but I had no problems with burnt bottom or cake coming out the pan(without parchment). There was no trick to this cake...follow the recipe, it was very easy and came out exactly as expected.

Absolutely fabulous. Based on the ratings, I knew it'd be great, but I didn't expect it to be THIS great! I'll make this again and again and again... (my cakes needed an extra five minutes in the oven tho)

It doesn't get better. Fool proof. Classic. I put it in the hall of fame with few others.

I've never gotten so many compliments on my cooking! My uncle who swears he hates cake, said this was the only cake he's ever liked! I recommend making this for every holiday!

The reason I most loved this cake is because of how different it was from the desserts I usually make. I was worried that it would come out like gingerbread which I don't care for, but it didn't. It was defintely cake, and not at all bread-like. The crunch topping was much different (but yummy!) than the more typical "crisp" topping - no doubt due to the lack of butter. The whipped cream and strawberry sauce were the perfect accompaniments, and I wouldn't serve the cake without them. As another reviewer, I also did not do seperate batches of berries - and made more than the recipe called for. But I did have far more whipped cream than I thought was necessary, even by using it between layers. To make this less labor-intensive, next time I might try it in a bundt or tube pan and just alternate layers of batter and crunch in the pan and serve with large dollaps of cream. Would probably also be good with chocolate sauce in a less summery season.

VERY DISAPPOINTED in this! The taste of molasses was overwhelming! After reading all the positive reviews I was surprised how much I disliked it!

This is one of the best cake recipes, even die-hard chocoholics love this. I have even made twice as a wedding cake for 125 people. Besides being so delicious it is one of the simplest cakes to bake, you just can't go wrong.

This cake is incrediable !!! It was the hit of Christmas dessesrts last year. The strawberry and ginger combination is great. I'd give it five forks if I could.

We are ginger fans but not big on whipped cream. Instead, I made this in a springform tube pan - just 1 layer of crunch on the top with berry sauce and whipped cream on the side. IT IS DELICIOUS! A 12" pan required 1 1/2 times the batter and about 35 minutes baking time.

I made this cake for Easter dinner, and everyone just raved and wanted the recipe! I only made 2 8" rounds and iced the whole thing with cream. Then garnished with whole berries. Very attractive. Great spring or summer dish. The sauce is wonderful, but could have used more. I did not bother with seperating berries. I only left a few out for garnish, then pureed the rest with the sugar and lemon juice slightly- leaving it a little "chunky" still. Will do again for sure!

What a great cake. However, when I make it next time I will not put any whipped cream on the sides until ready to serve. This will cut down on the amount of whipped cream. I have found out that you can rewhip cream the next day and still use it. All of my Easter dinner guests thought this was delicious with the strawberry sauce.

I know a pastry chef who makes this for her restaurant and can't keep it around long! I've made it twice and it's always a show stopper. Beautiful presentation and wonderful flavors. Ditto the comment on overbaking....brown sugar will burn so be careful on the timing.

I have made this several times. I agree that you need to wait to frost because the brown does bleed through. Don't overbake the cake, the brown sugar will burn. This is a keeper, one of my favorites.

Festive "birthday cake" with butterscotch crunch overtones. Recommendations to use parchment paper are valid, and doubling the sauce is wise. I assembled cake 24 hours in advance, adding final whipped cream layer just before serving. It cut beautifully. For a higher cake, make an additional half-recipe of batter, adding more batter to each layer.

This is a beautiful cake, nice and tall - again, one I make for my customers in my cafe & sell as a birthday cake to customers. It's beautiful & yummy. The gingerbread, crunch & strawberry combo is a treat.

This has to be an all-time favorite...My husband actually took the recipe to a bakery to have it made for my Birthday one year! I have made it many times and it never fails to impress.

This was a nice change of pace from plain cake with buttercream frosting. The cake layers are a little delicate, so definitely use the wax paper on the cooling rack. I also used parchment rounds in the bottom of the pan to make sure the topping doesn't stick to the pan.

This cake is scrumptious! I unwittingly omitted the butter and it not only came out good, it was delicious. Next time I would add the butter. It's tempting to frost the top of the cake with the whipped cream but the problem is that the brown sugar from the cake bleeds into the frosting and eventually turns it "beige". The spice flavor is delicious, as is the accompanying strawberry sauce. This is really a sublime combination of flavors and textures. I would consider making more strawberry sauce than the recipe calls for, the next time I make it.
