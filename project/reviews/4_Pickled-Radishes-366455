Perfect!! And I am from Eastern Europe, so these just might fit the cultural taste preferences, but I thought they were amazing. And so easy to make!!!

I have made these zesty pickles four times. They are fab! I read another recipe that said to add a split hot pepper, which was good; I've also added lemongrass from my garden and oregano. Thanks to the other reviewers because the one that said their Eastern European houseguests loved them sold me on making them, and because I also made pickled eggs with the brine as suggested...Sick!

While I thought these were okay, my Russian houseguests loved them and asked if I had anymore of "those little spicy radishes". They are very strong tasting and made me winch when I ate them, but they are worth making simply for the novelty - and they're easy.

I saw this in my latest issue of BA and had to try it. I changed the recipe slightly, using rice wine vinegar and fewer garlic cloves. It was great. Had 'em devoured in 2 days! But what to do with all that pretty brine? Made pickled eggs! Wow, two for one.
