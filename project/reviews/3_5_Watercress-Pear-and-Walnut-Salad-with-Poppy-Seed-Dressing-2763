Wonderful! I've been making this for years. I suggest adding crumbled stilton or blue cheese on top.

We made this for a special salad for Thanksgiving, and didn't like it at all! Tons of it leftover. Would NOT recommend it.

Easy and delicious! You can use any greens in place of the watercress - spinach, field greens, etc. I also added some chopped apple for added crunch, sweetness, and color.

A big hit at Thanksgiving. The only reason I did not give it 4 forks was that I thought it lacked a little zip. I think I might use a better quality or a little more vinegar next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband was very wary of a salad with watercress, but ended up liking it very much and had seconds. It was nice and light, and went well with my beef stroganoff (made with beef ternderloin).

Good and unusual... and goes with everything.

This salad really surprised me. I didn't think it would work, however, there were so many rave reviews that I had to try it. I will be making a variation of it for Thanksgiving Dinner. I used an Asian Pear, carrots, red onions, cilantro, and added some ginger-hoisin marinated pork tenderloin. Wish I had some blue cheese to top it with.

I used raspberry vinegar for a beautiful dressing. Delicious, and so colorful over the pears with red leaf lettuce.

Made a variation on the actual salad - red leaf lettuce, red onions, thinly sliced pears and toasted pecans. The dressing was great. I did cut back to 1/2 cup of oil and it was so tasty. Everyone loved it at my mother's birthday luncheon. I served the salad along with grilled mustard, thyme salmon and a potato tart. Enjoy!

Amazing dressing! So simple, yet so good. I added shallots to the dressing. I also used spinach as my green, and toasted my walnuts with a bit of sugar and chili powder so they were crispy and tangy. Used red bartlett pears and it was incredible alongside our Thanksgiving turkey.

Good dressing on romaine lettuce, mandarin oranges, and dried cranberries. I used 1/2 cup of oil and it was fine.

This was delicious and so easy to make. I used lemon juice in the dressing also and added dried cranberries to the salad - delicious.

I made this salad the other night for my family and we all loved it. It looked very oily and scared us at first, but as soon as you take a bite, those fears disappear.

Made this at Thanksgiving and again for a Sunday brunch. I substitute butter lettuce for the watercress. The poppyseed dressing is wonderful. This is an excellent light and slightly sweet salad to accompany a heavier dish.

I took this salad to a BBQ last night and it received rave reviews! I did as the last reader did and used lemon juice and only 1/2 cup of oil. I also used less mustard, since I didn't have 4 teaspoons. I can't wait to make it again and use some of the other suggested additions.

This is an awesome recipe! I have made it three times in the past two weeks. For the dressing, I used lemon juice instead of vinegar, and only 1/2 cup of sunflower oil. It's good with a sliced MacIntosh apple, dried cranberries, and toasted pecans. We love the dressing with other salads, too.

This dressing is yummy. I used tender green leaf lettuce and added some crumbled gorgonzola. It would also be great with mesclun.

Delicious. I used spinach rather than watercress and added Craisins for additional color and taste.

Made this as the first course for Thanksgiving and everyone cleaned their plates. My husband sid it was one of the best things about the entire meal. I may add some crumbled blue cheese next time.

I always am asked for this recipe whenever I make it. I use baby spinach and garnish it w/ blue cheese. Delicious!

Delicious-the combinations really blend, especially if made a day ahead. Using a little less oil helps too.

I made the dressing only to accompany a spinach, jicama and grapefruit salad at Thanksgiving. The dressing was just ok by itself, so I threw in a whole tomato before adding the poppy seeds. It was then perfect for the kind of salad for which I'd made it.

This was our salad at our last gourmet club dinner. It was extremely tasty and very easy to make.

This tasty dressing was so easily assembled from pantry staples that I find myself using it for many other salads.

This was a very delicious salad. The dressing was very good. I added some gorgonzola cheese to this salad and it gave it an extra "kick". Definitely a keeper!
