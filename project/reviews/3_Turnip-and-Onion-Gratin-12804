I made the origonal recipe and hated it. The Turnips were way too strong. After cooking this dish I added lemon juice, dill, and black beans, and the dish turned out great!!

The recipe was good but I did add some garlic and red pepper to give more taste.

Blech! What a waste of fresh food! Other than adding herbs I followed the recipe exactly, and the turnips overwhelmed everything. They weren't cooked all the way through (despite half-an-hour in the oven)and I couldn't detect any cheese in the final product. If you're looking for a good turnip recipe, I would recommend the risotto with bacon or the creamy soup, both on Epicurious.

To the mixture I added about a half of teaspoon of cracked pepper, and one tablespoon each of fresh oregano, marjoram, tyme and rosemary. I will change the amount of parmesan to about a half of cup next time, may even add some cheddar or mozzarella. This really is a different recipe that will cause your guests to inquire what is in it. The fresh herbs are a must.

Very nice savory dish when you have extra turnips.
