This recipe was relatively easy to make and I am absolutely an inexperienced person in the kitchen...so the fact that I can say that says a lot about the recipe. I was only able to find tamarind paste, so I mashed it up, added a little water and used that for the tamarind sauce. Seemed to work okay. It has some heat (at least my chili pepper flakes did) that lingers on your lips for a few minutes, but nothing uncomfortable or extreme. It didn't have the red colour that I have seen in many pad thai's at restaurants. All and all...it's worth a try and quite simple.

Any recipe that calls for "a few glugs" and "a dash" is not gonna be that picky about the exact measurements. At one point, she says "taste and adjust the seasonings" ... I did that and ended up adding more sugar and hot pepper flakes. If you taste and adjust the way she says to, it's amazing. I'll admit I was skeptical. No garlic or ginger? What kind of pad thai recipe is this?? I doubled the recipe (hungry people + leftovers) and ended up adding water to the wok to further soften the noodles. They should stretch a little bit before they break, but not be hard in the center. She's right about how it has to be good thai fish sauce -- don't be shy with it -- it contributes a great amount of the flavour to the dish.

Where to start...chewy Pad Thai noodles is a bad start for any Pad Thai dish. You should pre-soften the noodles first. It needs a little extra sugar. We will have to make this again to see what it's real potential is. But made to the recipe, this is sub par to the many variations of Pad Thai we've had.

This was alot of fun to make. As far as a recipie goes it went pretty well. I like how it was more a technique instead of a exact recipie. The tamarind sauce I made was pretty fail, but that was my own fault. Will make again in the future.

also - i cannot understand why it calls for twice as much stock as it tells you to actually USE. i can only see where it calls for half the stock...but that was OK and it worked out. just had leftover stock that didn't get used. another thing - my fish sauce was Thai kitchen - 4 or 5 glugs x 8 and it was fine. not too salty at all!

this was delicious! i am pretty sure the key is the tamarind. I had never used tamarind before, but it was not as hard as it might seem. Remove the fruit from the pod, soak in boiling water for an hour, moosh with hands, strain, tada! tamarind sauce i loved the cashews instead of peanuts. we were out of cilantro which i am sure would have made a huge difference in added flavor. the recipe is super vague on a lot of measurements....i made this x8 - but i only used 4 eggs and 8 green onions in total. I used 3/4 lb pork tenderloin and 1 chicken breast and it was a bit too much meat.... maybe some seasoned tofu next time? as a previous reviewer said - this was very beige. not sure what could help but i added some sweet chili sauce (nam ploy) and that added some pink, sweet and spice. not sure how authentic that was - but overall this was really YUMMY! big hit! will make again and again.

Inedible. Maybe our fish sauce was bad. Only once before had we thrown away a prepared meal. But, now we have done it twice. Ate something from the freezer instead.

Exceptional! I had difficulties finding tamarind sauce in my neighbourhood, but found a "pad thai" sauce in the grocery store. Haha! It sounds cheezy, but tamarind is one of its main ingredients, so I subbed in this sauce for the tamarind and it actually worked fantastically! ...make sure you know your fish sauce, as they can be quite different from one another...

This recipe would be even more authentic if we didn't use the recommended chopsticks since Thais don't eat with them.

i botched this pretty bad, it was my first time cook pad thai. The recipe is pretty vague as far as measurements so i think that may be the culprit, that and i don't have a wok:(

Good recipe. I only used two glugs of fish sauce and it came out fine. Next time I might increase all of the sauce ingredients slightly or adjust noodle portion down a bit. Good recipe though!

Everything about this recipe is good. It is an entertaining presentation of the recipe. Food should have a history, it makes it authentic and people appreciate it more. The instructions are very helpful and I found it turned out delicious. Superb!

This recipe was delicious and easy. We didn't have chicken stock and used chicken bouillon in water instead, and substituted peanuts for the cashews, which worked well. We didn't have red chile flakes, so we just added hot sauce at the end. We served ours with fish sauce, the leftover scallions and crushed peanuts, the requisite lime wedges and some sliced cilantro, which helped green up the otherwise beige plate. This was completely delicious and i would definitely make it again.

This is the best pad thai recipe I've found, and it's so easy -- but if you're not familiar with how fish sauce can behave, go easy and go slowly when you add it! Different brands of fish sauce vary wildly. Know your fish sauce, taste as you go and don't follow the measurements slavishly; this isn't that kind of recipe.

Not sure what a 'glug' is, but my glug was too much! Maybe I had the wrong kind of fish sauce but it was too salty. I will try it again though.
