Sorbato is terrific and make a great dessert! Just skip the Proseco

The sorbato is wonderful but not in Proseco. The cream in it make the wine looks cloudy and really sort of nasty. It is a good idea but next time I will use sorbet in the wine and save the sorbato for dessert.

The sorbato gets 4 forks but the drink overall gets only 2. The cream in the sorbato makes the drink look cloudy and really sort of nasty. The idea was good so next time I will use plain sorbet without cream in Proseco but I will make the sorbato again just for a treat.
