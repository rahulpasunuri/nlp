I love this recipe, I have made it also with chicken cutlets and pork cutlets. My kids love when I make this!

So simple, and so delicious! Quick to make. We loved this recipe and will definitely be making it again. I used dried rosemary, because that's what I had, and canned mushrooms, also because I didn't have any fresh mushrooms. It would be even better with the fresh ingredients.

I had this recipe for years and luckily was able to find it here. This dish is amazing! Quick and easy and lots of mmmm's at the table. I serve it with rice and a green veggie or salad.

ABSOLUTELY A KEEPER! So quick and easy and the flavors were fabulous! I used portabello mushrooms and regular tomatoes and dried rosemary....a cinch!

I found this recipe ages ago in the magazine and tagged it for future use. I finally got around to trying it recently and was rewarded. My husband and I loved it and he immediately said I should feel free to make it again (which I have). I made it without any substitutions and thought it was great.

After reading other reviews I was hesitant to even try this dish. I was thrilled at how it came out. I followed the recipe using baby portobello mushrooms. Also, I roasted the tomatoes to give them more flavor and remove the skin in one process. It fits into our healthier way of eating, and good enough to serve to company.

I made this as written instead of all the substitutions. If you're splurging on veal scallops, try Veal Scallops with Creamy Mushroom Sauce or Veal Scaloppine with Gorgonzola Sauce. Both are on this site and tastier.

This recipe is excellent. I substituted chicken cutlets for veal. My husband even raved about it.

This recipe is very easy to do and quite tasty. I substituted tenderized beef cutlets and it turned out great. I also substituted Gallo Pale Dry Sherry.
