I just made the chicken and sauce, and used it as a burrito filling. Roasted the tomatillos and a serrano pepper prior to blending up the sauce. A tasty and reasonably quick meal.

So INcredibly goood! Completely worth the 2 1/2 hours time it took to prepare. I don't like greasy tamales, and these were not greasy at all. The tomatillo chicken mix made the tamales so light and flavorful. It is tempting to add more broth to the masa mix because it's a stiff dough texture. Don't so your final dough is firm enough to lay out in the corn husks. We'll make it again but with a tamale party to go with it!

This is a very good recipe. I made it as stated and it was delicious. If your tamales were "gooey" then you probably didn't cook them enough. They will be fine after reheating. fresh from the steamer tamales are softer than when you eat them reheated though so maybe you weren't expecting that. Tamales can be tricky and humidity can be a big factor in knowing how much liquid to add to the masa. Experience is worth a lot. Keep trying. They only get better.

These were a TON of putzy work...the tamales them selves came out gooey rather than firm. The flavor overall was good.

The tamales where great served with the creamy salsa verde and chipotle chile sauce. I used a prepared tamale dough and it worked fine.
