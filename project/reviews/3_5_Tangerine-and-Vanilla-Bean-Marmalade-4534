Delicious, my first marmalade. I substituted 2 c of freshly-squeezed Kino tangerine juice for part of the water, and the color, flavor and texture were magnifique! Love the vanilla bean! Our friend Shawn picked the Kinos, and he loves the marmalade too. ebs

Amazing amazing recipe! I'm running out to the store for more vanilla beans, I must make more! I changed it up just a bit after reading reviews and because I only had one bean on hand. I used one bean and upped the sugar to 4 cups as I wanted a sweet marmalade. It actually cooked to about 218 in about 30 min, didn't expect it to go that quickly so it got a bit hot but it sets up beautifully and tastes like a heaven.

I really like the end result of this marmalade. I think the vanilla is a really lovely complement and didn't experience the bitterness that others did. I will say that I had quite a time getting the temperature to rise to 210 degrees. I finally had to pull the mixture off the heat when it truly started carmelizing far too much, but never did my thermometer show it reaching much over 200. Strange, but I'll be sure to keep this recipe. It looks very nice in jars.

i made this with organic oranges and lemons and it was delicious. initially it was too syrupy but since most recipes suggest 220F for marmalade we just kept cooking it to 220. perfect for our little gift jars.

I made this recipe today as part of a group of jams to give as holiday gifts and it is very good. I doubled it so it took a good while longer to jell. Processed it, in sterilized jars, in hot water bath for 15 mins. Nice golden color and really yummy flavor. If you are looking to make holiday gifts, I would also suggest the pineapple pear jam and the cranberry jam with vanilla bean from this same website.

The flavor was great although I expected the end result to be thicker like a traditional "marmalade" - instead it was syrupy. I used the slicing attachment on my food processor which made this really easy and quick to prepare. The thickness of the tangerines was perfect. I will definitely make this again although next time I will use pectin or something else to help it congeal.

I make batches for gifts every year now. Last year I used clemetines instead to avoid having to seed the tangerines and it turned out just as well. The end result tastes much more complicated than the easy task of making it!

I made many batches of this to give as gifts last Christmas. I also gave other homemade jams, jellies, and goodies, and this was by far the recipients' favorite. I made it with fireweed honey instead of sugar with great result. I found the suggested recipe produced marmalade with rather large chunks, so I sliced the tangerines into matchstick slices. Some of my recipients used it in glazes for ham and in sweet and sour pork/chicken recipes.

I thought the marmalade was wonderful! The vanilla was a bit strong, but it was great when I added only 1 vanilla bean. I also added a few extra tangerines (I like a lot of peel/pulp).

Had potential,but I found it much too bitter even for marmalade.I think the tangerines should have been soaked then rinsed and fresh water used.I also didnt think the vanilla had the intended affinity-although it was nice enough!

It takes a while to make but it is well worth it. I made a big batch and filled up small jars as christmas gifts, everybody loved it.
