Takes a little more time to make, but overall, the result is worth it. Tastes just like my mom's recipe, except my mom used a lot more ingredients. I added alot more Chinese mushrooms and Chinese bacon then the recipe actually required, but this is according to each person's taste. I made several batches, froze them all, and when I start to crave this particular dim sum again, I either steam it, or even better, fry it. Delicious!
