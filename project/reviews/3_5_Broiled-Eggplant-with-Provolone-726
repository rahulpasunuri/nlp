Taste is good but little too greasy from the Italian dressing.

Definitely a keeper. Very quick and easy and delicious! A great side dish for Italian meals! I added a portabella mushroom on top of each eggplant slice as a previous reviewer suggested. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe rocks! I am thrilled to finally have a quick, easy, healthy way to prepare eggplant. Best of all are the innumerable options! You can't lose with this one. I followed recipe minus the rosemary and oregano since the salad dressing was already well seasoned. I finished by simply sprinkling with a combo of parmesan,romano, and asiago. YUM!

Great recipe. I've tried to cut down on fat by using Newman's Balsamic Light Vinaigrette (which works out really nicely), have used fresh rosemary, and then a combination of Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. Delicious recipe, even for your friends and loved ones who insist they hate eggplant. That would be my MO before I found this recipe!

This was fairly easy and delicious. I used a high-quality jarred sauce and also sauteed sliced portobellos and added a slice to each eggplant round, which added another level of flavor. I served with pesto pasta. My husband really enjoyed it. Will make again.

this recipe also works with zucchini. Either way, it's a delicious quick meal. I've used bottled lite Caesar dressing and sharp provolone - a keeper!

This was a crowd pleaser, as a main course for vegetarian friends and as a side for meat-eaters. I used Paul Newman's lighter dressing with lemon and added sauteed orange peppers underneath the cheese. Great as left-overs, too.

This is kind of a "lazy man's" eggplant parm. It was a very easy to make and the results were loaded with flavor.

This turned out pretty good! I didn't have provolone so I used swiss delicate and didn't have any marinara sauce so I rolled the eggplant after it was broiled with the cheese on it. I thought it was good and will try it with Marinara sauce next time!

great..but in this summer heat used thinly sliced jearsy tomatoes instead of the sauce..also peeled the eggplant as many people including myself get stomach pproblems from the peel

GOOD SIDE DISH. NICE PRESENTATION.

I must admit I was skeptical before I made this recipe. Turns out it's exactly as delicious as promised. I used Swiss cheese and it worked out fine. I'm not a die-hard eggplant fan but this dish really is terrific.

This was delicious, and although my husband doesn't like eggplant, he loved it too. A couple changes: I salted the eggplant before baking. I didn't feel like having a tomato-y meal so I omitted the marinara sauce. I replaced it with some sauteed mushrooms under the cheese. And I sprinkled a topping of caramelized shallots on top of the cheese before putting it back in the oven, just because caramelized shallots makes anything yummy. Very very good and easy to do. Give it a try even if you don't like eggplant - it might change your mind.

Easy and delicious. I put one eggplant round on bottom, folled by tomato sauce, provolone, a second eggplant round, and topped with parm. An excellent vegetarian main dish.

Wow, this was fantastic! If you aren't in the mood for Italian, try it without the marinara, it's delicious! This is an elegant (and effortless!) first course that I was proud to serve to company.

This is such a great recipe. It is a wonderful light dinner. Tastes much better to me than the normal eggplant parmesan. Wonderful!

Great!! I didn't have Provolone so I used Swiss. Easy to make and an excellent side dish.

I made this recipe as a main dish for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, and it was terrific. I decided to "kick up" the marinara with some sautéd onions and mushrooms. I also used a balsamic dressing to bruch the eggplant slices. This is a recipe I will definitely make again.

A quick and delish option for a weeknight dinner.

This was a huge hit at my dinner party. I served it as a main dish by stacking the eggplant slices with a layer of spinach-ricotta filling in between, and by adding a layer of roasted red bell pepper underneath the cheese, and finally adding a parmesan breadcrumb topping. It also made for a great presentation. Will definitely make again.

Excellent and oh so easy! I too used Basil and Balsamic Salad Dressing.

Very tasty and easy to prepare - a nice change from the breaded versions. I made it as a side dish with my own homemade sauce. Will try some variations next time and may use a different cheese.

This is a very easy eggplant recipe. It tastes wonderful, as a matter of fact I had a couple of leftover pieces for breakfast!!

This was excellent...so much less fat than the traditional eggplant parmesean & every bit as tasty. I used sliced roasted red peppers on top of the sauce..then the cheeses. I will definately make it again!

The best eggplant recipe that we have ever tasted! I used "Ken's Steak House" balsamic and basil vinegarette in place of the Italian because that was what I had. In my husband's words "It's Killer!".

I'm not a huge eggplant fan, but I would make this again. Eggplant lovers will really like, and the presentation is nice for an italian side dish or an appetizer.
