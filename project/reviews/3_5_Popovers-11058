I fix this recipe every time steak is on the menu. They always make a big statement. It is crucial to have the proper pan and to preheat it. Tasty variations include adding bleu type cheeses and minced rosemary. A sprinkle of rock salt on the tops as they come out of the oven is a nice touch.

These are very good and easy, but baking times are way too long. Need to experiment with your oven. Do follow directions on pre-warming ingredients. Recipe is too small for us; we use the King Arthur Flour recipe with 4 eggs,1 1/2 c milk, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 1/2 c. flour and 3 TBSP melted butter.

Do not know why person at 5000 feet had problem I am at 6100 and they came out excellent ( I do have a new oven) I do agree cooking time at 450 is to long I turned them down after 10 minutes and continued to cook at 350 for about 20 minutes longer came out excellent and are still good the next day (very unusual for popovers)

Did this using a 12 cup heavy muffin pan filling each cup to the top. Came out fantastic. Huge top with a nice crunch, creamy soft interior. Only regret is that I didn't make a second pan of them.

We have recently moved to an elevation of 5,000 feet above sea level. This recipe did not pop for me at this elevation. How do I need to alter this at this elevation to have popovers that pop?

I agree with Cook from Kansas -- cooking times are too long. And yes to Uigei -- the batter is supposed to be runny.

Delicious but THE TIME IS WAY OFF! Mine were bordering on overdone after 20 minutes so I never got the chance to turn the oven down but instead pulled them out and knifed the top and removed them from the popover pan to stop them from continuing to cook. I think next time I'll cut both cooking times in half and they should be perfect.

Excellent, very versatile recipe for basic popovers. It's foolproof, so long as you do not open the oven during cooking! The cooking time seems to vary dramatically with location, so I keep my eye on them. In my own home, after the first 20 minutes at 450, they are almost done. Another 5 min at 350 and they're perfect. Sometimes I sprinkle fresh parmesan or crumble blue cheese on top, right before baking. These make for a great impromptu replacement to dinner rolls, and are great for a breakfast on the go. They are super quick to whip up and make minimal mess. This recipe is very adaptable to a variety of uses. When I am doing a sweet version of these, I add just the smallest amount of vanilla bean paste to the milk. I have noticed they do rise quicker when my ingredients are at room temperature. Batter should be quite runny, not thick.

I am allergic to dairy, and so I made them with Earth Balance butter and regular soy milk. They still came out delicious! No one could tell the difference. We used jams and preserves on top when we ate them.

I am really hoping to make these for my family, but my grandchildren are on a dairy free diet. Do you think I can make these with soy butter and rice milk, or should I just make bread?

This is a very good recipe for basic popovers. I have made them many times and have found some things that make a difference in the outcome. Allow all the ingredients to reach room temperature. Do not substitute low fat or skim milk for whole milk. Give the batter a brief but vigorous whisk before putting the batter in the cups. Incorporating air into the batter helps them rise.DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR DURING BAKING! Have faith that they'll "POP". We serve these at tea with butter and strawberry preserves, just like the Jordan Pond House at Acadia National Park!

Oh my goodness...what a great recipe. It was verrry easy, and all the ingredients were right on hand. I followed someone's suggestion and added a little butter to the batter (1 TBSP), and they were indeed flaky. I filled my tins to 2/3 full and they came out with an amazing crown....however only four popovers. I'll feel confident in increasing my recipe by 1/2 C more of milk and flour.

I got exactly what was promised with this recipe - delicious, basic popovers. One of our local restaurants serves their popovers with honey butter so took a shot of making our own and it was a hit. Room temp. butter mixed with honey and a bit of vanilla did the trick (this is for a spread, not in place of the melted butter for brushing). A nice and simple side and has more flair and a plate of sliced bread!

I got 8 perfect poppers the first time! I don't have a popover pan, never made popovers before. I used a regular muffin pan, which worked fine. I sifted the flour, measured out 1 cup, then sifted it again with the salt. My eggs and milk were cold from the fridge - no problem. The popovers popped after less than 10 minutes at 450 and were starting to brown, so I turned down the oven to 375 after 15 minutes. I then let them bake for another 15 minutes, but I think they could have gone a full 20 mins. They were a tad doughy, but still dee-lish! Next time, I'll let them bake longer. We had them with a spinach, garlic, tortellini soup tonight. Every one was eaten up! Will definitely do again.

I used unbleached white flour (Bob's Red Mill) and these were delicious. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I was in a bit of a hurry, so increased the temp by 5 degrees, which sped it up by a few minutes. Popovers are one of my (many) favorite foods - yum!

Rating: 3
This recipe is ok, they didn't all pop the way they should. Maybe I did something but I've made lots of popovers and not had this problem. They were fine but could have been lighter. my favorite recipe is popovers with sage butter which I think you can find on this site.

I've used this recipe a dozen times with great results until I used my new oven. It took three attempts to get a good result as I, too, had some issues with an overly hot oven. If you don't get these right the first time try some of the suggestions in these reviews and I'm sure you'll get there. Mine turned out well at 450 for 15 minutes and 350 for 25 minutes using a popover pan. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Rating: 3
These turned out really well. I followed the recipe (preheated the muffin tins, didn't chill the batter) and they "popped" up beautifully. However, I did poke a little hole in the top of each one when they came out of the oven (to prevent collapse as they cooled). I used regular muffin tins which yielded 10 and baked at 450 for 15 minutes and 350 for 10 minutes.

I made these again with about one ounce of shaved pecorino romano and three good grinder-turns of pepper stirred in. The variation was outstanding! I'm so taken with them that I'm planning on replacing dinner rolls with these popovers!!! (Didn't mean to rate the recipe twice but I can't seem to get the forks to go away).

Rating: 3
This recipe is quite good. I made the popovers in 9 standard-sized muffin tins. Baking time was 20 minutes at 450 and only 12 minutes at 375. They weren't quite as flaky as I would have liked, so I'm planning to add some fat to the recipe next time. I served them for brunch with either sour cherry preserves or grey poupon dijon with jalapeno havarti. Next time I'm going to softly scramble some eggs with diced peppers and cheddar to fill the popovers. These were an almost-instant dish to make and considerably healthier than the pancakes and waffles I often make. I'll be making these again soon!

i tried the unbleached bread flour on two batches and they didn't pop. for the third batch i used gold's unbleached all-purpose flour and they finally popped. popover tins worked well as did leaving the batch at room temp for 30 minutes.

Hadn't made popovers in ages but just made them this morning for my fiance & they turned out just as I remember. I turned the heat from 450 to 375 after 17min & had let the batter stand for 30min prior to baking. Served with four-berry preserves this morning but I'll be making them for dinner soon too - great recipe

Rating: 2
Don't use all-purpose flour - use bread flour instead. I have thrown away batch after batch of this recipe using all manner of tricks (popover pan, thermometer in oven to ensure temp, chilled batter, etc) to coax a pop. It wasn't until I switched to bread flour that I was rewarded with a reasonable pop with unchilled batter (I got the idea from another popover recipe).

Rating: 4
First time I ever made popovers, and they are fantastic (I have made them multiple times in last month). It is vital to have a popover pan, however -- otherwise the tops are caved in. Also, in a modern oven (well insulated) the temp drops only slowly, so I turn it down after 15 mins. Keys to our success include: sift flour, use whole milk, bring milk/eggs to room temp before adding flour. I have not scientifically determined which of these variables are actually vital. Also, an easy enough recipe for my 13 y/o son to make on his own, with great success.

I have also done the basic recipe and added a flavored coffee creamer (hazel nut) to it and it gave it a party flavor.

I make these for almost every special event. They go wonderfully with mushroom gravy, beef stew, red plum jam, you name it! However, in some ovens (my own rental house oven, my neighbor's rental house oven... I'm sensing a theme) 20 minutes at 450 is all they need before they are done. I'm not sure what it is, but if you are making them for the first time, make sure you check them before turning the oven down!

I always had trouble making popovers, but this recipe is easy and they come out perfect everytime. I think keeping the batter cold and heating the pans in the oven for 5 minutes makes them pop so high.

Doubled the recipe - great addition to a holiday meal - used leftover batter for breakfast popovers the next morning - great with butter and jam. Used skim milk and just a muffin pan - got rave reviews! Will make these again at xmas!

For those of you whose popovers shrink when they come out. The inside is not done enough. If you think they are too dark, cook them at 450 for 15 minutes and then reduce to 350 for another 18 - 20 minutes. One other suggestion from Americas Test Kitchen Cookbook. The popovers will be even taller if you let the batter rest for 30 minutes before pouring in a hot pan. This recipe is correct. Hot oven, Hot Pan and baking times.

I chilled my batter and pre-heated the popover pan. All of them popped. However, after cooling they all deflated and looked wrinkly and sad. What am I doing wrong?

I made these popovers this morning, and they turned out just as I hoped. Despite my extraordinarily crummy oven that has wildly varying oven temps, the popovers all popped and browned nicely. I made the recipe exactly as written. The batter sat in the fridge about one hour prior to pouring it into the hot popover tins. This fridge time seemed to plump up the batter a bit, making it slightly thicker than when initially blended. I served the popovers for breakfast with cinnamon butter from another recipe on this site. The popovers were a hit, we'll make them for special occasions, especially when the nieces and nephews visit.

I made this recipe, just as it is, for Christmas dinner this year. It went off perfectly. The guests raved about them. They tasted just like the popovers I remember from my childhood. Excellent!

I just need to clarify my preceding review. I made the popovers and they "popped" even with the batter turning out lumpy. Would definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
This recipe turned out perfectly! I even ended up with lumpy batter and was worried I would bake very flat muffins. The trick is to heat the pan (I used a regular muffin tin) and to chill the batter. In a regular muffin tin, the popovers took only 30 minutes total to bake.

This is a pretty good popover recipe - I use it often as I have yet to find the perfect, better one. I don't have a popover tin so I use a non-stick muffin tin instead, and simply reduce the cooking time to 10-15 min @450 and 15 min @375 in order to accomodate the smaller size. I've never had a problem with them not popping, but I will warn you that you *must* either sift the flour or break it up very thoroughly with a whisk or fork, and every time I've not buttered the pan the popovers have stuck to the cups very badly. Overall, a very solid recipe. Adding a little bit of melted butter to the batter doesn't seem to affect the 'pop', but it definitely makes them more indulgent!

All my popovers "popped".The secret is hot oven and cold batter.I chilled my batter for 1 hour.I got rave reviews for the lightness of the popover

This is great recipe with a little modification. A friend said that the popovers were the only "genuine" bakery product he had seen and tasted outside of a bakery. I changedthe recipe only slighlty. I don't use the melted butter and I bake them at 375 for 50 minutes (give or take depending on the oven). I usually double the recipe to make large popovers.

Rating: 3
I found out in one of my old fashioned recipe books that the key to making great popovers is to start them in a cold oven. You start the temperature high like it says and the reduce like it says. As long as you start them in a cold oven, you shouldn't have any trouble getting them to "pop".

Only 1 of my popovers actually 'popped', the others had ok popover flavor, but were more like muffins. I didn't sift the flour, but that was the only part I didn't follow. any ideas?

This is a wonderful recipe that produces light, airy, delectable popovers. As soon as they came out of the oven, I poked holes in the tops and dropped small pats of butter and dollops of jam inside. They oozed with deliciousness! This is the perfect popover recipe that I will make again and again. I can't imagine a better treat for breakfast or brunch.

I had never made popovers before - if only i'd known they were so easy! Yum. Thanks to other reviewers, I shortened the baking time. Even so, the second batch (once the oven had really warmed up I guess it was hotter) got a little black around the edges. I'd say after 10 minutes at 450, start watching carefully; I assume they can finish at the lower temp w/no problems.

I have made these several times now because I´m determined to have them turn out perfectly. They are always good but I´ve found that pushing them as far back in the oven and not opening the door makes them puffier. I also have to reduce the times by five minutes before and after reducing heat but thats probably just my oven. I love these equally with steaks at dinnertime or for breakfast with jam.

I always thought Popovers were like Yorkshire Puddings, but the texture is quite different! This recipe was quite good, and the preparation was easy. However, they browned quite fast, so next time I'll either use a lower oven setting, or I'll take them out earlier.

Very good and surprisingly easy...always felt intimidated to make popovers...I reduced the time as mentioned by another by 5 minutes on each end and good thing because tops were brown...the only thing I would do differently is purchase a popover pan as my ramikin cups baked smaller popovers but still light and airy.

i just made these in my college dorm, and they were delicious. i would recommend baking them for 30-35 minutes total, rather than 40 (turn the oven down to 375 after 15 minutes). i added a tablespoon of sugar to the batter because i like my popovers to be a little sweet.

I first made these for a special Valentine's Day dinner, they were wonderful and I've been making them ever since. The recipe is so easy - they turn out beautiful everytime.

This is a basic popover recipe, but fantastic nonetheless. Growing up in Massachusetts, I can remember eating popovers at Anthony's Pier IV in Boston. They were delicious with butter melted inside! They really are not that difficult to make, and they are a great addition to any meal. You can use regular muffin tins if you don't have popover pots, they just come out a bit smaller.
