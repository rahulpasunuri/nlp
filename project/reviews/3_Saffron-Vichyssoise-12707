Bleck. I used quality ingredients and don't think I botched the preparation, but the end result was the worst soup I've ever made. It had no depth of flavor. I rarely throw food away but two days of this for lunch is all I can stand.

To finish this soup, run it through a sieve/chinoise for a smoother end result. Otherwise, a pretty good version of the standard.

This is a great vichyssoise recipe! I used homemade chicken stock instead of the canned. The flavors were great after one day, but better after sitting for 2 days.
