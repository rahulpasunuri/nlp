This is Flavia. Just wanted to let you all know that lately I've had great results by using bone-in beef shank instead of beef chuck for my mom's recipe. It remains more tender and gelatinous and won't dry out as quickly as chuck.

Rich and delicious! I used Sam Adams Summer Ale for the beer, and rye for the bread.

i really love this stew. its simplicity means you need to use the highest quality ingredients. the beer you add makes a huge difference. i use 2 small bottles of Duvel beer in the stew and drink another one with the stew.

tasteless. Or rather, tasted like warm yeasty beer. I ended up doing a lot to it to "fix it". Added a few spoons of tomato paste, brown sugar, thyme and parsley. I would not recommend making it unless you're looking for a chance to do some kitchen crisis improvisation. My end result was decent, but something very different from what the recipe was meant to be.

It tasted okay, but not good enough for all the work that went into it. It's really labor intensive without much payoff. Also, it looks terrible, and some people might be turned off by the texture.

This recipe is certainly not bad, but you could add some cloves, nutmeg and thyme, they go very well with it. Apart from that I'd definitely use strong Belgian beer with at least 7% alcohol to add sweetness and body. If I were Sloppy from Japan I'd go out and get a hamburger at McDonald's, probably tastes better than what he made of this recipe.

Being Flemish myself (from the Antwerp region and not from Ghent) I tried this recipe when Safeways had beef on sale last week. It reminded me of my own mother's beef stew. Not sophisticated but simply very good. For beer I do not recommend pilsner but a good Belgian ale. I used Fat Tire from the New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins, CO. I also threw in a piece of dark chocolate and I used only half the amount of bread as recommended. Also my favorate cooking equipment is a crock pot. It is so much better to have it simmer in a crock pot for 4-5 hours. Other than that I did not change the recipe.

I too have been making a dish similar to this for a while now, and it is one of my husband's fave meals. I thicken with flour and use a deep flavoured ale rather than a pilsner (I've even used Guinness). In my recipe I put the bread covered with course grain mustard and gruyere cheese on top of the dish at the end of the cooking time and leave it under the grill until melted and golden - one slice for each person. I don't stir it in! Yum.

Best recipe I've gotten from here yet. I used Leffe beer, which produced a deep flavor and aroma that went very well with the dijon mustard. The guy who said this recipe was a waste of time probably used miller light.

Too time-consuming (about 45 min. to prepare, plus TWO FULL HOURS to simmer) and it wasn't worth all that effort. I didn't like the bread stirred in to thicken the stew, either.

This is a very similiar recipe to one I've been making for years, I found the recipe in an old Woman's Day cook book. It is one of the best stews I've ever made. It called for 1/8 tsp nutmeg and thyme instead of bay leaf. one garlic clove and thicken with flour instead of bread. I serve it over mashed potatoes or rice. Every man I've fixed it for really liked it. If you like braised tips you need to try this recipe.

I loved this recipe except for one thing. When I stirred the bread into the stew it turned 'ugly'. From a rich, dark brown to a greyish slimey glop. Company was coming for dinner so I quickly cooked fresh egg noodles and poured the stew over the noodles on a big platter and sprinkled liberally with chopped parsley.Candlelight helped too. Next time, and there will be many next time, I will omit the bread, add a little mustard while the stew simmers and serve crusty bread for sopping up the wonderful delicious broth!

Try this recipe like we do it in Belgium with Rodenbach Beer, a dark red sour beer from Roeselare in West-Flanders. For a very special sauce put in a piece 50 gr of dark chocolate.

Do use Belgian beer, I always use Geuze (and the meat should be under the beer) , and serve with French fries (and mayonaise - no ketchup please!!) I cook the stew for at least three hours. And add some flower to the gravy at the end, to thicken it more. My recipe is very similar to this one, and always a huge succes! Great to freeze leftovers for a lazy day!
