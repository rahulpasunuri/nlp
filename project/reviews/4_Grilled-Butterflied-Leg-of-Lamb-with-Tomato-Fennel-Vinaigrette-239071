I made this for a dinner party of 8 people and everyone loved it. So good! The leftovers were also delicious the next day. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Don't skip the vinaigrette - my guests all agreed that it really elevated the dish. I will definitely make it again.

We LOVED this recipe. For just 2 of us, I used a lamb rack, rubbed it with the marinade and let sit in the refrig for several hours. To make the marinade/paste, I used the food processor and it chopped the tomatoes, kalamatas and fennel seed beautifully--no need for a mortar and pestle. I had a surplus of the delicious vinaigrette--which we thought added a LOT to the dish--so we addded warm french bread to the meal for dunking in the vinaigrette. It was a truly great summer meal.

Awesome recipe for the meat, easy and delicious. Followed instructions exactly. Probably wouldn't bother with the vinegrette again. Our cooking time was very quick - for 4 lbs of inch-thick meat...five to six minutes on a side. Served with cheesy orzo and a greek salad.

We made this recipe with Lamb for New Year's Eve and it was better than anything we would have had in a restaurant. The vinaigrette adds a wonderful flavor. We made it recently with fresh elk sirloin which was amazing as well, we unfortunately over cooked it a bit, but it was still a winner.

Followed recipe except for fennel seeds which I did not have on hand. Anchovies lend a nice flavor that is not immediately recognizable. The vinagriette did not impress me but the lamb was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Made the recipe as stated, except that my plans to BBQ were rained out and I held off for another day. So the meat was in the rub for an extra day, which didn't hurt it one bit. It was delish and moist. The vinaigrette was a nice complement, but I need a find a more exciting starch.

Excellent! Tender, moist, flavorful! We also had grilled plank salmon and crab stuffed chicken and the lamb was the first to go!

This was the best ever lamb and I had many worries about it. I followed the recipe except that I rubbed the herb olive oil mx over the outside and inside butterfly portion. I closed up the lamb and baked at 325 in the oven as it was not yet barbeque weather in Minnesota. The vinaigrette was surprisingly good. I still served mint jelly which some guests preferred.

This recipe is delicious! I used a boneless leg of lamb (3.5 lbs.) and marinated it overnight WITH the anchovies. They are a must! I cooked it for about 1 hour and 20 minutes at 325 degrees until the thermometer read 120 degrees. We sliced it and served the tomato-nicoise olive sauce over the top. I used some zinfandel vinegar and scooped the leftover garlic and oil that fell off of the lamb into the sauce. mmmm mmm mmm!

A total winner and super easy. I didn't grill it and roasted it in the over instead (to 135 degrees) and it was a big hot at the dinner party.

I served this to a dinner party and everyone went wild for it. The only thing I did different was to use cherry tomatoes as that's the only decent tomato available in the winter. I used multiple colors from dark purple to gold and that made the sauce very pretty. I did not seed or skin the tomatoes I also just quartered them and cooked them with the other ingredients for a short time. When serving I reheated on the stove instead of the grill

Fantastic flavor. Made it exactly to recipe, served it on shredded lettuce drizzled with lemon juice and a side of orzo cooked in broth with thyme, orange zest and finished with parm. cheese. A most delicious dinner party course.

WOW ~ this is a real a great dish for dinner parties. My guests loved it...so did we. I didn't use the anchovies, but next time I will give it a try. I have left over vinaigrette and plan to use it over fish tonight. I served the dish with the sicilian style potato gratin

Made this for Easter.. skipped anchovies as one guest has allergies but am making again this weekend and definitely will be using the anchovies! This was fabulous the second day,cold, with the sauce cold..( did a whole leg even though there were just 4 of us).. in fact almost liked it better cold. This would be a great addition to a summer barbecue buffet.

One last thing, add the anchovies! It is just another element of saltiness and complexity that will leave your guests wondering. There is absolutley no fishiness-think about it,you are grilling!

The flavor was outstanding and the presentation beautiful and colorful. Very unusual flavors that blended so well. I was sceptical about the vinaigrette, but it was divine. Two things: get fresh kalamatas for sure. Cook to 120, 130 is medium and the lamb will be tougher and grey. Please, if you love meat cook to 120 and carve immediately!!!
