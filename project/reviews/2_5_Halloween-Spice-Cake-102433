The molasses was so overpowering, none of the other spices or the flavor of the apples could even begin to be savored

It looks like someone updated the recipe adding the eggs and sour cream. I liked the idea of the apples on the bottom and the spice cake baked on top. I thought the spices in the cake were a little too overpowering and the cake was a little dry. Next time I will use a different gingerbread recipe and use less sugar on the apples

Whisk the eggs? What eggs? Add the sour cream? What sour cream? Is it in addition to the yogurt or instead of? Unfortunately, not a successful recipe.

Had to be my all-time worst recipe I ever got on Epicurious. Nothing subtle about those spices. Tastes like someone just shook raw spices into my mouth and I swallowed. Even my husband who likes just about anything I bake thought it was too strong.

Be prepared to share this cake with either a large family or a big party of friends. The cake was delicious, but very rich. Would be a treat at Christmastime. I used only 2 eggs, which seemed perfect. I also used a 13x9 pan as well as a 9x9 pan. The cakes are much thinner (about 2"), but that might be best considering the richness. I also used only yogurt, no sour cream, and thought that was just fine as well. Considering the amount of sugar it looked like was in the cake, I used a sour apple - I believe Granny Smith. Would try a slightly sweeter one next time - It didn't come out quite as sweet as I imagined. (Fuji would be perfect). This would make a wonderful "gift cake."

I used 3 large eggs, and for a twist I used Date Molasses. Next time I will use 2 large eggs. Using 3 eggs caused the cake to rise more than expected, it looked like a quick bread. The overall cake was wonderful, but a 13x9x2 inch pan was too small. I suggest using two pans instead of the one. I also lost all of the apples when I turned out the cake, I allowed the cake to cool slightly, about 5 - 10 minutes, and they still stuck to the bottom of the pan.

This is an excellent cake but you have to really like molasses. There is a problem with the way the recipes reads, 1) it listes yogurt but then asks for the sour cream to be added. I added 1 c. each 2)It asks for eggs to be whisked in but doesn't list them. I used 3 large eggs. I baked for the min. time and it was moist beyond compare. Also tastes better at room temp. than lukewarm. A cinnamon icing (but not too sweet) would also complement this.
