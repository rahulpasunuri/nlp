This was a great recipe! They did come out more like merengues, not macaroons, but that was fine with me. I've never successfully made merengues before, but these came out perfectly with very little effort. I had a cup of almond meal on hand that I was trying to use up, so I didn't use the full amount, but they taste wonderful and are very cute. I'm going to make another batch for Thanksgiving next week.

This is a really great cookie recipe. Nice and quick with great flavour. I used pistachios and orange zest instead of almonds and lemon because that is what I had in the house. Plus I added a teaspoon of Cointreau to heighten the orange flavour. I'm always looking for recipes to use up egg whites and this one fit the bill perfectly. Will definitely make again.

Definitly a tasty dish, but not much in the looks department. I was hosting a somewhat uber chic event and ended up not using them at all. Would do it again for a simple dinner party but not for anything special.

These are good MERRINGUES not macaroons. I offer concern for England to exercise care. Eggs should be well cooked to avoid problems with salmonella. Merringues should be light and dry. I would be careful not to aim for the texture of a macaroon which is chewy and gooey. Most merringue recipes I've seen are vanilla or chocolate. The almond and lemon are wonderful in this recipe. To speed up the baking I baked for 15 min at 325. I'll definately make this again.

Very good. I found 20 minutes baking just enough to end up with a sticky consistency in the middle, which is the way we like macaroons! Quick, easy and inexpensive.

This is a good one. Great texture and nice flavor, the lemon and almonds marry well. This is a quick recipe, one I'll keep in mind when I need to do some mid-week, after-work baking.
