This torte was fantastic. Since I made it for a dinner party and wanted to make it look beautiful I piped a lattice shaped semi-sweet chocolate ganache on top (callebaut chocolate) and topped with pecan praline. Not only was the torte beautiful, it was delicious. Got rave reviews. I am planning to make it again for a luncheon next week.

This completely deserves development -- quite unusual, quiet simple and fast. I followed recipe as written with few exceptions (for cake, halved the sugar to bring out nut essence, accidentally used 3 egg whites vs 4; for frosting, used 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, light sour cream and added some grand marnier). My NEXT cake, which will happen quite soon, will (1) keep cake same but smooth batter a LOT before baking to get more even layers, (2) double whipped cream and add chambord, apply over a layer of raspberry jam (3) add chambord to 4oz bittersweet chocolate/light sour cream for a smooth, thin elegant layer that doesn't overpower the pecan layers. Quite lovely, this, I think. It's worth a good try, 1:15 start to frig.

This was not bad. If I make it again, I would definatly add a bit more moisture to the batter, maybe a bit of rum or brandy. I found the cake a bit dry.

My husband and I thought this was absolutely delicious. He had trouble believing it incorporated that many ground nuts. The frosting sounded a little strange, but it actually went quite nicely with the torte.

I re-read the reviews AFTER I made this torte and wondered if they were written about the same dessert. I've had better. Much better. Didn't like the texture of the layers (and I love nut tortes) or the strong sour cream flavor of the topping. My second dessert (a chocolate mousse cake) got all the raves.

Excellent! I made this for a family birthday, for the first time replacing my grandmother's legendary birthday chocolate cake. Expectations were low, skepticism was high. The result: rave reviews from a highly discriminating grandmother and seconds taken by a very health-conscious dad! The recipe is already on tour. Everyone loved it. It had the looks and taste of a classy restaurant-style torte. Some especially liked that it was not too sweet. It's really not hard to make (the only thing that confused me was the butter paper/wax paper instruction - i just lined the cake pans with greased wax paper and it worked fine). So to all those who -like myself- get nervous about baking anything that doesnt come in a box with a picture on it, I say: go for it!

I ran out of pecans and substituted walnuts for the cake, and skipped the icing in the recipe, using a ganache with 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 1 Tb of Grand Marnier instead. The cake layers came out shriveled and funny-looking, so I was prepared to be disappointed, but after I added the filling and icing, the results were delicious. It looked and tasted almost like a bakery cake, only tastier. I'll definitely add to my file of fancy cakes.

This was excellent - the cake layers were moist and the filling light. Excellent combination of flavors. I made it for my husband's birthday to rave reviews. I decorated the cake with orange-chocolate mousse. Will definitely make again.

Thought this was very tasty - though I had a tough time getting it done - it took 10 more minutes, but maybe my oven is off. Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful! I made this a second time and added quite a bit of Kentucky burbon to both the filling and the frosting. Intoxicating!I think I'll try a little Grand Mariner next time. Even the kids liked it--they never eat anything I make.

Despite the use of pecans, this cake perfectly fit my vision of a French gâteau: light (although the filling is rich), not overly sweet, and with complex flavours. I'm sure it would be terrific if one were to substitute hazelnuts or walnuts for the pecans, and may try it that way next time.

I made this for the first time for New Year's 99, and I'm doing it again by demand for 2000. I don't have much experience baking more than cookies, and this came out beautifully in every way. Highly recommended!

I made this for a friend, so I didn't eat any. She said she liked it, but didn't give details.
