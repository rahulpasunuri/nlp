A lot of time and effort but worth the great results. Delicious.

The dressing alone is wonderful, and I will be using it again and again!

This is an absolutely delicious salad to serve for special occasions -- It is a lot of work to put it together but we have served it several times to friends who have asked us to make it again and again because it is so good ...

Endless work and very salty. Not sure what the point is.

I loved this salad as a collector of salads and dressings. I did use my own pickled beets in the salad since it was quicker but everything else was followed. This is very delicious and expecially the reduced juice viniagrette.
