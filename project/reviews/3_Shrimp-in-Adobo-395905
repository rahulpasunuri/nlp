Super easy. I ate mine with corn tortillas garnished with radishes & cilantro.

I made all of the fillings in this article and this was our least favorite. I thought too much work for the outcome. I cut the shrimp up as recipe was written, but they looked like some kind of larva. If I made it again (doubt), I would keep whole, but use small shrimp.

Made this for the first time. After I made the Adobo paste I found it was lacking a little finesse so I added a little more sugar. I also left the shrimp whole and allowed them to marinate an hour prior to frying. On the whole a decent dish. I served this with some fresh pico, and a cucumber avocado salad with a drizzle of sweet chilli sauce (which really set it off nicely).

Mediocre at best
