An excellent dish which, while a challenge to make the first time (one must learn how to use Nori), is exceedingly simple once one has a clue about rolling sushi.

Definitely blow off the cabbage roll factor if you want, nori is foolproof, and I think it tastes better in this recipe. Guests who can't get into the "raw fish" concept of sushi really enjoyed these.

This was an amazing recipe. Low-cal, Low-fat...but full of flavor. I am not a cilantro fan so I left it out in some rolls. I also added cucumber matchsticks. The chili sauce was incredible but I added a bit more rice vinegar and some honey to cool it down. I used the cabbage and thought it was surprisingly easy to work with. Next time I may add sesame seeds too!

Ian: You might have more luck finding Cilantro if you look for Coriander, which is what it's called in the UK ;) .. as for the recipe - I don't honestly see much reason for using lettuce rather than regular Nori (seaweed) which is conventionally used for sushi and which is, to the best of my knowledge, fine for veggies. Always feel free to experiment with sushi -- I personally love cream cheese in mine. Also, proper "sushi soy sauce" is much tastier for sushi than some other kinds such as most Chinese soy sauce, which is rather overpowering for the delicate flavours.

i have substituted mint, flat leaf parsley , or a combination of the two for cilantro, in your area cilantro may be called by a different name, coriander, or chinese parsley. also cilantro is easily grown from seed in a pot or in the garden

The cabbage/lettuce leaves are challenging to work with and need to be well-dried to work. A little wasabi goes a long way toward bringing out the flavor here. Even my nine-year-old liked these.

I don't know what I did wrong but these babies were impossible to roll and even harder to slice. They were extremely soft and hard to handle. Unfortunately, I can't rate the taste as I had destroyed them so completely that they had to be disposed of.

Some of the ingredients are hard to find. I had to omit the cilantro leaves, and decided not to try to replace them with something else. This did not seem to take anything away from the taste, but if anyone could give me an alternative suggestion I'd be grateful. Overall, a really tasty and filling dish.
