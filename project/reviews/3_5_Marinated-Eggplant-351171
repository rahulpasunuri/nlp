My good Argentine friend introduced me to excellent marinated eggplant and this recipe is as close as I've found. While it takes time to marinate, it's a simple prep. I made it per instructions with one change, I did not boil with the vinegar. Instead I added red wine vinegar to my taste preference before jaring it. Sometimes I add kalamata olives to marinate with it or red pepper for spice and color.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I use the finished product on sandwiches, salads, pizza and crostini. It is also fantastic as is or on an antipasta tray. I have mad this many times and will be starting a new batch today with my farmer's market eggplant. A perfectly balance recipe, in my opinion!

I thought it sounded intriguing, despite the very time consuming process. But... it had no taste! Not bad, but just not nearly enough taste for an all day process. Very disappointing. I don't know how it is supposed to taste--perhaps it is meant to be bland and slimy. If so, then yes, this recipe will get you to bland and slimy.

So good! So simple! So Italian! Put in a sandwich and take it to a whole other level of delicious.

I never cooked eggplant before. Truth be told I never really liked eggplant but I got one free and decided to try a simple recipe. I read the reviews and decided to cut mine into large chunks, salted it with kosher salt for a half hour prior to marinating and then followed the rest of the recipe. It was amazing, simple and would make an excellent side dish to about anything. I actually like eggplant now!

This is the perfect 'go to' appetizer. I've used it on crostini, in sandwiches and to perk up bland salads. Adding a pinch of hot peppers to give it some tang was nice, but it is lovely as is.

I was really looking forward to this dish but was a bit disappointed - first of all, the step where you boil the eggplant in the vinegar mixture made my apartment smell terrible.. and the look and consistancy of the eggplant after it was done marinating wasn't very appealing. To salvage it for a dinner party, I threw the eggplant mixture into the food processor and then added some fresh chopped parsley. Served with fresh baguette, it was actually pretty tasty. I made the mistake of adding a couple of extra cloves of garlic, which was just too much with the marinating time. If I were to make this recipe again, I would use less garlic and maybe only a splash of vinegar in the boiling water. The vinegar taste was just too strong for my liking. The guests really seemed to like it though, and it was all eaten in a flash.

I served this for Easter and it was very well received by my guests. I followed the suggestion about using 1/2 cup plain vinegar and 1. cup cider and it worked great. This was wonderful served with lamb. An easy do-ahead dish!

This is a great recipe. We liked it better than our original family recipe. I know it is time consuming but well worth it. I made it using japanese eggplant and it was not "seedy" at all. The vinegar/oil mix was fantastic. We like a little heat so we added red pepper flakes.

I found this recipe to be a lot of work, expensive, and too vinegary. I know the Argentines who first made this for me wouldn't have used such an expensive oil. Next time, I'll look for a different recipe.

This is an excellent recipe that I have made several times. It is a hit with everyone that I have shared it with. Several of my friends now ask me to bring it for potlucks and shared meals. This eggplant is good on a variety of crackers, breads and even chopped to make a relish for burgers.

This is fantastic! Easy to do (albeit not quick...but a little advance planning does the trick), and a great way to use up the inevitable overload of eggplants come fall. Make sure, though, that you don't over-press the draining eggplant, and that you don't skimp on olive oil (mixing in the bowl is important, before you put it in a jar). Elsewise, the eggplant ends up tough and dry. Also, I've never had white wine vinegar, so I've substituted 1/2 cup plain white vinegar and 1 cup cider vinegar with perfectly yummy results.

exactly how my mom and grandmother used to make. i agree that it's great to keep on hand as a great addition to a cheese/antipasto platter. you don't need to refrigerate...can be kept out in a tightly sealed jar.

Excellent! Easy to make and everyone loved it. Don't be shy on the garlic.This recipe works equally well for other vegetables such as mushrooms, carrots and so on. Since these veges are not watery like eggplant you can skip the drain,weigh down steps.

This eggplant does not last for one month chilled in the fridge. It never lasts more than a few days - it gets eaten all too quickly!

I adore this recipe. I've done it several times, and now aim to keep a jar in my fridge at all times. We've put it on pizza and pasta, as well as spreading on a hunk of baguette for a quick snack. So good.

this was delicious and easy, and friends who don't like eggplant loved it. We snacked on it after our party for a few weeks and it keeps well. It is a great thing to have around as a snack on toasted sourdough.

I loved this recipe. I generally don't like eggplant, but made it for a party with some vegetarian friends. It was gobbled up. Though it took some planning, it was pretty easy in the end.

There are many other marinated eggplant recipes that are faster, easier and tastier than this one. While the flavor was ok it was not worth the effort. It was barely touched at a New Years Eve dinner. I am going to add some roasted red peppers and mushroom and toss it with pasta to finish it up. Very disappointed in both the look and taste.
