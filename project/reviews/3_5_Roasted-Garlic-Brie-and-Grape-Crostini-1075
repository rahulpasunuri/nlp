Great recipe w/ nice presentation. I brushed baguette w/ the left over garlic oil, toasted; then put on Brie BEFORE the garlic spread. Grapes last. The grapes hold in place nicely as they sit in the garlic spread.

Delicious, and a lovely addition to the table. Roast the garlic a day ahead, and it only takes minutes to put together.

This is one of my favorite appetizers & has been for a number of years. I'm not sure what folks found to be time-consuming. Shortcuts to roasted garlic: Be sure to peel off the outer layers of the garlic head and cut off the tip of each clove (no need to fully peel). Douse with some olive oil, wrap tightly in foil and bake. Once it's done & cooled slightly, just press down on the head to extract the garlic from each clove. This might help save time. Also, no need to use a foold processor; I just use the back of a spoon to combine everything. YUMMMM!

I don't believe the negative comments on this appetizer. I have made it numerous times and always rteceived raves and there has never been one leftover, even at big spreads where there was so much food there was leftovers of almost every other item! Make sure you use ruby port and increase the marinating time.

although my guests liked it, it was actually more time intensive than suggested and not so good as to warrant the time spent.

My guests loved this recipe. It is a bit time consuming but worth the effort.

Guests raved about this recipe. Made the whole recipe for 6 people, not a morsel left! The only change I did was to broil the crostini after adding the cheese and before adding the grapes to ensure the cheese was soft. Fantastic recipe!

I love this recipe. It has a great combination of flavors and is always well-received when I make it.

Yummy! I forgot about the garlic, next time I'll remember. I was out of port so I used cab. sav. combined with balsamic vinegar turned out good anyway. I am really looking forward to making it again.

I thought this was an unusual and tasty crostini and it was well accepted at a party I attended, even by guests that rarely venture beyond meat and potato fare.

Everyone at my Christmas party loved this dish. The roasted garlic was very mild and savory and the grapes were terrific. I will marinate them longer the next time but they were very good. i'll definately make it again!

Wow, I'm surprised by the latest reviews. I made this last year based on reviews at the time and everyone loved it. I've made it many times since, and have always had people asking for the recipe. Only once have I had leftovers - that just made my husband happy - more for him! Only problem - the brie is difficult to spread on the baguette, but I usually heat it up a bit (as recommended by earlier posts).

I can't believe the epicurious.com is listing this as the appetizer of the day. I made it a few years ago and it is so-so at best. Not worth the effort and something I won't be making again.

I must say, I can't entirely believe that anyone who cooks with that much garlic would be able to rustle up any guests to serve canapes to! Whew!

My first two fork and no repeat review. Have to agree with the previous three reviews. For the time and money involved it was not worth it. Love all the ingredients, so I thought it would be a great dish, esp. after all those other rave reviews, but I was dissapointed.

I thought this recipe was just ok. It is an attractive appetizer, but the flavors don't blend very well. I love brie and would rather try other recipes.

I was enticed to try this dish by the earlier reviews, although I'd had some trouble getting my head around the fruit. The grapes in themselves aren't bad, and I expect just the green ones would do nicely with the cheese..but the port is something else entirely. Forget it. You can't go woring with roasted garlic and brie, but this dish as it was, was the only thing left on my table after a big do.

Just ok - grapes fell off the bread slices and preparation was more time consuming than it's worth. However, the garlic spread is terrific - I would suggest just using that as a spread with some soft cheese - forget the grapes.

A fabulous New Years appetizer - I brought it to a dinner party and it was a hit!! The cheese should definitely be soft...that makes it much easier.

The flavors of fruit, garlic, port and rosemary do not blend; instead producing an argument between conflicting tastes.

I agree that the spreading of brie over roasted garlic is challenging, but the results are well worth the effort. This was a fantastic Christmas appetizer.

I made this dish as a christmas appetizer, and it came out extremely well. Be sure to make plenty of the garlic spread because you will want leftovers. Also make extra marinated grapes; they made a popular finger food by themselves and also helped brighten up a blueberry cake drenched in custard for dessert.

I made this for a fancy dinner party, and in my rush forgot to put in the rosemary. Still was fabulous. I used red and green grapes and they looked very festive. After the comment about spreading the brie, I made sure the brie was soft and I didn't spread too much of the garlic paste on the bread. Worked beautifully. This will be a staple in my appetizer collection.

A great combination of savory and sweet. I had a difficult time spreading the thick brie over the not as thick garlic puree, and opted for more of a yin-yang arrangement for each. The port marinated grapes are excellent with this. A mixture of green and red grapes would look great on a holiday buffet table.

Killer appetizer - - the combination is a definite winner.

All the ingredients are delicious to begin with and put together deepens and enhances how the dish looks and tastes. It startles the complacent and delights the adventurous cook. Ah, another use for rosemary!
