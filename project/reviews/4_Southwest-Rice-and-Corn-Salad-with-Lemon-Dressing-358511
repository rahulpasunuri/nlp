Good, not great. Added small diced onion and garlic to the saute. Definitely needed more dressing. I would make this again, though.

Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown rice. Doubled dressing. Added red pepper and increased corn. Added salt, salt as flavow was weak. Overall is very good.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party last night and everyone LOVED it and even asked for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but when I tasted it, I noticed it needed more dressing, so I made another half batch of dressing, and it came out perfectly! Looks beautiful too! Will definitely make it again and again!

I made a number of substitutions based on what I had in the house, and this salad came out great. I used brown rice, a green bell pepper, a shallot, and sriracha sauce (because I didn't have poblanos in the dressing. I chopped a tomato and added that with the scallions. I didn't use zucchini--didn't have any. Anyway, husband and I love it this way. Definite keeper.

Quite yummy! Somehow I neglected to add corn and yellow pepper to my grocery list so I definitely want to add those next time. I'd say three forks for now and I'll reassess after I've had a chance to try it as written. It went well with the Chicken with Tarragon and Quick-Roasted Garlic recipe on the Bon Appetit site.

This was excellent and my boys were fighting over the leftovers! I didn't have a poblano chile so I used ~3 of my oven roasted (had frozen them from my summer bumper crop) jalapeno chiles which worked great. Added a nice zing to the flavor. A definate addition to our "make it again" category!

Great recipe! I like to make a little bit more of the lemon dressing than the recipe calls for as it's very lightly sauced with the amount they call for. All in all, a wonderful side dish!

This recipe is very good and easy to make. The only thing is that it lacked zing. My husband and I added a little apple cider vinegar to amp up the flavor. Also, the recipe calls for this to be a cold/cool dish, try it hot...its fantastic!

Perfect! Besides laying on lots of salt and pepper, there's nothing here I would change. I'll certainly make it again and look forward to the next potluck or barbecue.

Great and easy recipe. I added raw garlic to the dressing which gives it added flavor and used brown rice medley. Next time, I would use more colorful veggies, seems to be a lot of yellow - maybe a red bell pepper. But overall very good for a dish thats either a great side or main for vegetarians/vegans. Also gluten free(my friends have all sorts of food restrictions)

I made this recipe once so far, and it's definitely destined to become a summer favorite! Needs more salt, as indicated below. I adjusted quantities of vegetable ingredients a bit, based on what I had on hand (more fresh corn, less poblano) and it was great. I know it will be even snappier when I up the poblano pepper to the amount called for.

I don't know what I did wrong here, but this was a gross, sopping soggy mess. The dressing make it even worse. Awful.

So delicious. I used brown rice instead of white and left out the poblano chili just because I forgot to get it at the store. Delicious!! The lemon juice keeps the avocado nice and green and I ate off of it for a few days.

I made it exactly as written, turned out really well. www.EntertainingRecipes.org

Very good! Made this for our Memorial Day barbeque and it was a big hit. A little different from the usual, and very fresh tasting with lots of veggies. Made exactly as written, using frozen corn.

This is really tasty. All three of my kids liked it, which never happens. And my non-lemon-liking husband thought it was great too. Definitely a keeper summer side dish.

I will make this again and again and again.....

Really quite delicious and perfect for a midsummer grill out. Shareta (see below) was dead on about the salt. Use a heavy hand with it or be prepared for your dinner companions to ask to pass the salt.

This is a quick and simple recipe I used to prepare as dinner one night after work. I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I noticed as I was tasting was it needed quite a bit of salt. Next time I will try charring the vegetables for a smokier flavor as well.

I used Quinoa cooked in a dilute chicken broth. I added 1/4 large jalapeno pepper without the seeds and it needed more. Got good reviews at a family dinner.

This recipe was delicious!, really easy to make and has a wonderful light taste. I used instant rice (the one that takes 5 minutes) and I couldn't tell the difference. The veggies turned out perfectly crunchy. It took a total of 15 minutes to prepare.

The lemon dressing really makes this great! Made this with whole grain millet instead. For baby, mixed some with egg and added cheddar for pan fried cakes. Loved them!

A very satisfying dish. It's all about the fresh vegetables' textures playing off each other. I used only 3/4 cup of rice as opposed to a full cup and it was more than enough and also cooked the veggies for a few minutes longer. I served it with cheese quesadillas for a full vegetarian meal. Delicious!

Just made this recipe. Really loved how fresh everything tasted. My boys loved it too and all had seconds.

Absolutely delicious! Lemon is an important touch here. So don't skip out on the lemon!

Delicious and fresh spring salad - to make this a little healthier, I substituted quinoa for the rice and for heat replaced poblanos with jalapenos. Otherwise to the letter and we loved this salad. It was delicious with the chicken with tarragon and quick roasted garlic as pictured in Bon Appetit!

We loved this salad! Had to use frozen corn because it's too early in the season for fresh, and we used both fresh poblano and a green bell pepper. We served it with a pan-seared chicken breast, a little chipotle mayo, and a squeeze of lime. What a delicious dinner!

This is a delicious salad that combines your starch and your veggies in one side dish. And I think this will be a WONDERFUL recipe for the end of the summer when corn, squash and peppers are ready to harvest from the garden--especially to take to picnics and potlucks, as it's not mayonnaise-based. I took a tip from another reviewer and roasted all the veggies at 500 degrees for 20 minutes or so, until they took on a little color. And I sprinkled on a bit of red pepper flakes, but next time, I will roast a couple of serranos and/or jalapenos along with everything else for a little more heat than the poblanos give. I also used both green zucchini and yellow squash, and an orange pepper instead of yellow to contrast with the color of the corn. (Red would have been lovely, too.) Finally, I added two minced garlic cloves to the dressing, and used both lemon and lime juice. YUM!

my husband and i really liked this dish. i did boil and steam the rice (with oil and salt added to the water), but thought that it turned out well. we'll definitely make this again

With some modifications, this salad was loved by all. I used one cup cooked brown rice. This added a nice nutty flavor and a bit of crunch. I also added soy beans (edamame) for some color and protein. It blended well with the flavors and added texture. The lemon dressing: I added 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, zest from the lemon, and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. I like more zing in salads like this and it worked very well.

I didn't think this was so bad. It could have used more flavoring, maybe hotter peppers, but I enjoyed it. I actually forgot to put on the dressing the first time I had it, but it was good for a side dish.

Meh. This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I needed to double the dressing (which needed something else, though I'm not sure what). I also thought there was too much rice (and I should have listened to my intuition and cooked the rice in something other than plain water). I think that roasting the corn and peppers (and adding some fresh serrano/ jalapeno for heat) would help the flavor a lot, but this would no longer be a quick recipe. The dish was not at all spicy, imo - the poblanos didn't register any heat. There's potential, but I would make a lot of changes if I made the dish again.

This dish was AWESOME! Nice "salad" course. Served with the chicken recipe that is located above this recipe in the mag. And, yes, used the poblamo chili.
