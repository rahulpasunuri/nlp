This recipe definitely needs to be tweaked, but I followed the guidelines from the cook who lives in Siena and got great results. Tasty & comforting. And to the cook from Riverdale, while I normally enjoy reading about substitutions and improvements to a recipe, use some common sense: If you leave out the bread, you made tomato soup.

A creative fantastic taste of Florence

This recipe lacks! But the good news is that many other reviewers have good suggestions. Use much more garlic, red pepper flakes, a red onion, a bunch of basil and some red wine and it will taste like that little hole-in-the-wall restaurant we all ate at in Tuscany! P.S. A can of white beans thrown in also tastes yummy!

I think I'm the lone dissenter here. I really didn't think this recipe was any more than the sum of its parts. Not very interesting--like a watery spaghetti sauce. I won't make again.

My recipe for pappa con pomodoro (which i learned in tuscany) calls for nearly a cup of olive oil (or more!), heat, add chopped garlic, fresh basil and italian parsley and a bit of red pepper. then add the bread, which should be nice and stale, cook until the bread has absorbed the oil and is golden. at this stage add a can or two of diced tomatoes (or tomato pulp if you can find it) stir a bit, then add broth to cover. when the broth cooks off, add some more, until it looks like soup. I assure you this works MUCH better than the nearly flavorless (and infinitely less authentic recipie here)

Like the other reviews suggested, I roasted fresh tomnatoes with garlic, salt, black pepper and olive oil for 20 min. in the oven. I also added basil and skipped the bread part to make it a lighter dish. At the end I blended it all with an immersion blender, came out creamy and absolutely delicious. No leftovers!

this soup was divine! it's something you don't have to exactly follow the recipe, but it still turns out delicious. i used half fresh tomatoes, half canned. for the fresh, i baked two pints of grape tomatoes in the oven (with garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil) for 20 min or so. for the canned, i used italian san marzano tomatoes. i added a little parmesan into my bowl before eating - yum!

My wife and I discovered pappa al pomodoro on our honeymoon in Tuscany. This soup is incredible (we had the best at the Cantinetta Antinori, btw. but several other places do a good job as well.) It's tough to perfect the first time, but you get to look forward to a life time of fine-tuning a perennial comfort food. Use only good, fresh ingredients, such as leafy basil and vine-ripened tomatoes. One comment: turn up the volume on everything. It is actually possible to bring out all the tastes at the same time - tomato, basil, garlic, and pepper, without losing anything in the mix. Try briefly roasting the tomatoes after halving and draining them...it will concentrate the flavor while evaporating the unwanted liquid. It's fascinating how they managed to leave out the basil in this version of the recipe...I'm sure you'll know how to make it just perfect for yourself.

This was an amazing soup! I used fresh tomatoes from my garden, and it came out fantastic. Thanks to all who suggested the sourdough-it came out great.

I had some leeks to use up, so added only 1/2 of an onion. Also added some red pepper flakes. So good!

An old favorite farmhouse-style dish I used to enjoy in my local osteria when I lived in Florence. I found that it needed more liquid than prescribed in the recipe, so I augmented the chicken stock with a three or four ice-tray cubes of brown demiglace from my freezer and diluted with more water. This dish is best slightly hotter than lukewarm and with a touch more salt than your doctor would recommend.

very good. quick and simple as well. all of my guests enjoyed it. i used extra bread, and let the tomatos simmer down so they weren't quite so chunky.

This was perfect; it came out exactly like the soups we had in Tuscany. I added some sugar and a dash of balsamic vinegar towards the end. Also, I added more olive oil (about 1/2 cup total)for a creamier texture. Would definitely make it again--n.b. a meal in a soup.

Delicious and unusual soup. And very easy to prepare. Two thumbs up!

A great & easy recipe! Unfortunately not enough people will stumble across it while searching the site due to its name. I came across it from my subscription. Add some good quality grated parmesan before serving to make it even better.

Definitely good comfort food!
