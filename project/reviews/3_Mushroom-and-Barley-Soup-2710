This soup would be much better without the potatoes. They add nothing but a bland, heavy starchiness. I agree that more seasoning is needed. I threw in some roasted garlic and fresh thyme which helped a lot.

I loved my grandmother's mushroom barley soup as a kid -- and used this receipe as my first attemt to duplicate it. No such luck. It was good -- but too soupy ... not the luscious poridge type soup that I remembered. I'll try other recipies that call for roux or other thickening agents, but not this one again.

Eh. This is easy enough, but it doesn't taste terribly exciting. I tossed some parmesan on each bowl as I served it, and that helped a bit. It needs something--more herbs, I suspect. Not bad for just an hour on the stove, but not something I'll make again.

I am sorry to say but what I thought would be a fabulous soup from all the rave reviews ended up being bland! I tried to save it by adding garlic but it still did not help. I have a whole pot of it left and I guess I will try to figure out what to add today to save it otherwise it is going down the toilet!

This soup is just delicious. I was tempted to add some different herbs but was very glad I decided to follow the recipe, it has just the right balance of flavors and is very aromatic. I can't wait to make it in winter, perhaps even adding some parsnip. I did use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, so this makes an excellent vegetarian soup (vegan if you substitute olive oil for the butter!). Thank you for another recipe to add to our regular repertoire!

very good soup! I used wild mushrooms to make it vore woodsy. I also added a clove of garlic... that added just the right touch. My two-year-old is even crazy about it!!

I made 1/2 recipe which worked out quite well but wished I made the entire recipe it went so fast. This soup is hearty enough for a meal with salad and/or bread. Very good!
