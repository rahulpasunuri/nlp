Honestly, I just thought this was okay. It was good, but nothing exceptional. The flavor was a bit one-dimensional for me, even with the cayenne. It was easy and quick, so I might try it again with the addition of onions and/or leeks if I ever find myself buried under a mountain of corn.

This was fantastic! Minor changes - no bacon because I'm a vegetarian, so I used canola oil to saute the vegetables. Also vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and evaporated milk instead of the cream. I used smoked salt to season the soup and add some depth, and it was perfect. I will make this soup again and again.

Made it nearly to the letter and thought it was a really great chowder! But, perhaps we're gluttonous, because as a main dish, this is three hearty servings at best. Maybe four. That's fine, with just two people that still means lunch for me!

Whole family rated it a keeper - teenage boys included! Made as directed, though perhaps with less fennel (just 3/4 of a single bulb) and a mistake on the liquid (3 cups skim milk, 1 cup cream and no water!) Added a bit of rotisserie chicken to make it a one-dish meal.

This was my first-ever chowder and it turned out great. I love fennel, so I stuck to the recipe and did not use leeks as other reviewers had. I did make a few changes. I'm a vegetarian so the biggest change was I skipped the bacon. I added a few drops of liquid smoke in towards the end and it gave it that wonderful smoky depth. In addition, I used one zucchini and one yellow sunburst squash, and I swapped the russet for a white-fleshed sweet potato. I also fried some minced garlic in the oil at the beginning and added some thyme in with the vegetables. Dont skip the cayenne the recipe calls for at the endits fantastic and gave it some delicious warmth at the back of your throat. Ill definitely make this whenever corn is in season!

I loved the simplicity of this recipe and would have made it as presented, but I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I agree with the reviewer who said that this recipe is readily and easily adaptable. I'll be adding it to my base!

Wow! Really great recipe. Will add this to our favorites. We made a double batch and only used 4 thick slices of bacon which was fine for us (12 slices would have been a lot). Also we used the recommended number of ears of corn and were still short, we had some frozen on hand luckily.

I thought this was just okay. I thought for the first attempt I would stick to the recipe verbatim. Turned out more like a corn soup than a chowder...and definitely needs more flavor. Sorry! I'll check the other reviews to see the variations and maybe try it again.

I would make this again, and I have, several times. I think the beauty of this recipe is that it lends it self to changes. I have made it exactly as described, and changed it dramatically. Cooking on the stove right now is the chowda with leeks, yellow squash, blonde zucchini, new potatoes (with skin), and the big changeinstead of chicken broth I used the broth from last night's mussels with lager and lots of garlic (recipe is also on here somewhere, I added the extra garlic). I can tell by the aroma, it will be a winnerespecially appreciated because it is a damp, chilly 45° here in upstate NY on October 1!

I made this for a small gathering and everyone loved it. I wound up using yukon gold potatoes, replaced 1/2 the fennel with leeks, and I added some more cream at the end. It was fantastic - everyone loved it. I actually put in a little cumin at the end and that just gave it an extra boost that was well received. I already have people asking for the recipe

We really liked this recipe, but I'm not sure about the fennel. I used it, but, especially combined with the corn, seemed a little too sweet. I'd try it next time with the leeks as other reviewers suggested.

Excellent. I used leeks and half an onion, 1 summer squash, no cayenne, chervil instead of chives, 2 lg russet potatoes. My husband and I both loved it.

I'm one of those people who usually changes recipes a lot, but this time I stuck to it. The fennel added a really nice flavor, but if I wouldn't of had that, I probably would have used celery vs. the leeks that so many people recommended in the reviews. At the last moment, I realized that I didn't have any cayenne, but it was delicious anyway. For those of us who wanted spice, they just added Tabassco. It was a delicious soup, and I will definitely make it again.

I found this chowder but to be deliciously tasty. We found ourselves refilling our bowls and devouring the contents in its entirety before we sat back down at the table. It utilizes the best ingredients of the summer.

Yummy and very nice for summer (it was 103 here yesterday!). Like other reviewers, I substituted 2 leeks for the fennel and added 1/2 chopped onion. I will definitely make this again. And again.

this has become a favorite in our house. Since we have to be cholesterol friendly, I have made the following changes that resulted in a wonderful, very tasty chowder: I use leeks instead of fennel, added one chopped large sweet red pepper, thyme, 2 large shallots, fakin' bacon bits to add the smokiness without the bad fat. A few chopped fingerling potatoes, fat free organic chicken broth and canned fat free condensed milk ( I hate the concept of the condensed milk, but it adds the richness without the fat). I use an emersion blender to puree some of the soup...presto! A wonderful, healthy and delicious chowder.

A delicious and easy soup! Followed some of the mentioned modifications and used 2 potatoes, 1 zucchini, 1 onion and 1 shallot. Also added a sprig of thyme. Did not have leeks, but they would be good as well. Will absolutely make this wonderful soup again!

Great, easy soup! I took the suggestion from previous comments and substituted leek for the fennel. I also used a large sweet potato instead of the zucchini - it added some nice colour. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

Isn't everything better with bacon?!? This was a delicious soup. I used only yellow squash, and chicken stock instead of broth, (needed 4 cups). I wouldn't change a thing.

I usually hate reviewers that completely remake recipes, but I made a few adjustments to this one and it came out great. Like most reviewers I replaced the fennel with 2 chopped leeks. I also upped the quantity of vegs adding 2 small green zucchini & 2 small butternut squash. I had several heads of preboiled corn leftover from dinner the night before, so removed it from the cobs and added it to the soup. I had cooked up a whole bunch of bacon for breakfast, so rather than throwing away the fat, I used this to saute my vegs and omitted the crumbled bacon on the top. I omitted the chives too because I didn't have any. I ended up adding more broth because of my extra vegs and used much less cream than recommended: less than 1/4 cup to finish it. The soup was delicious - a wonderful blend of summer flavors and quite filling. A definite keeper!

This chowder is hearty and delicious but did make a few changes. I grilled the corn in the husks first which added a roasted, fuller flavor. I also used leeks instead of fennel (my flavor preference) and half and half instead of cream (somewhat less fat). YUMMY!!

I made this as the first course for a dinner party and followed the recipe exactly. The results were stellar. This is a very satisfying soup with a delightfully fresh taste and it is not overly heavy.

This was fantastic! Had a pile of fresh corn that I needed to use and it was a rainy Sunday! I don't care for fennel so I used leeks instead. I also added in 5 cloves of garlic...can't make a soup without it! Served with spinach/strawberry salad and cheddar bacon bread. Delish! Got rave reviews and I will DEFINITELY make it again!

Very good. Used up lots of the veggies in my farm share box, and great way to eat up the 12 ears of corn I get every week! Rather than using fennel, I used a sweet onion I had. Also, to avoid the cream, I added some flour with the onions when I sauteed them in the rendered bacon grease, making a roux. Then added some liquid and veggies, sauteed a few seconds, and added the rest of the stock. Made a nice thick soup, and just added about a 1/2 cup of whole milk towards the end. Delicious! Loved the idea of throwing in some summer squash.

i skipped the zucchini,added a finely chopped shallot, upped the potatoes to three cups and added fresh thyme. I also simmered the corn cobs in the chicken stock for about 30 min to give the stock a stronger corn flavour. Next time I would use leeks but it was very tasty and simple

This was delicious! I also added more potatotes - and used red instead. I added more turkey bacon too. I used my hand-held blender and made it a bit chunkier. Delicious!

I've made this dish twice now, and my husband and I adore it. It's so easy to make on a work night, and you really don't need to use fresh corn if you're pressed for time, we used bags of frozen corn (one 2lb bag is exactly how much you need). I add more potato every time. It's certainly not only a summer soup - try it in winter! It's delicious!

There was just a little too much corn for my taste. I know, I know -- what do I expect with a corn chowder recipe, but this was like eating corn mixed with a few potatoes, it didn't really taste like a chowder. If I make it again, I will cut down on the corn and include more potatoes. Also, the potatoes and fennel were overdone when cooked for the time specified in the recipe.

Add more potatoes for a nice, burly meal on wintry days. ...Ooh, that was good... Threw my diet to the wind, though, and added LOTS more bacon. My arteries weren't happy, but it was delicious.

Made it according to the recipe and I found the fennel way too overwhelming and the whole thing kind of lacking. Will not make again.

Easy and delicious. I used leeks and added a little chipotle powder along with the cayenne for more smoky flavor. I needed more broth to get it to a good consistency after blending it all with the immersion blender.

This was a really excellent, flavorful recipe. I used turkey bacon instead of real so the soup wouldn't end up so greasy (and because I just like it better). Next time I will substitute sour cream for the whipping cream, which thinned it out too much and didn't add any taste.

I enjoyed the recipe as she wrote it. The only change I made was similar to other reviewers, where I substituted half and half for the full cream. I also used the submersion blender so I wouldn't dirty another piece of equipment and it was delicious!

I enjoyed the flavors of this recipe. I also liked the fact that it felt like a healthier version of a traditional corn chowder...replacing the heaviness of potatoes without sacrificing the heartiness of a chowder.

I haven't tried this yet but I will. When blending hot things, remove the little add in cap in the middle of the top and put a towel over the hole. This lets the steam escape without blowing the top off.

Very good. Used half and half instead of the whipping cream and it was still very tasty. Used a food processor but next time I'll use a hand held, like someone suggested. Great recipe.

A suggestion would be to use a can of cream of corn and avoid all the cream & blending of hot soup. Just use your hand held blender and it zip's it up right in the pot and leaves some great texture. Very yummy!

Yummy, quick and easy. I like the fact that I didn't have to chop a myriad of different vegetables. Loved the fennel. Didn't have whipping cream on hand so I substituted half and half and it tasted just fine. Just a tip when pureeing hot soup in a blender: "Holding the blender top firmly" makes it sound easier than it is. Here's a trick: Since it's the steam that builds and inevitably blows the lid off, I take a deep breath and blow into the blender, blowing as much steam out of it as I can and QUICKLY replace the lid and start to blend. Works like a charm for me. Be sure to loosen the lid, while blending, letting the steam vent out.
