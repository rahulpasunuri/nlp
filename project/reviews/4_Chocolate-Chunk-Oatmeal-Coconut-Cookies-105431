cut the recipe in half and omitted nuts. Made the cookies smaller and they were done at @9 minutes. Good but not too that sweet

This is now my favourite chocolate chip cookie. I substituted pecans for the almonds and used chocolate chips instead of chunks. The texture and taste of these could not be better. I will be making these over and over... and over again.

Definitely an excellent recipe! I love coconut, so next time I will be sure to try the half butter/half coconut oil trick someone else suggested here. The recipe can accommodate any kind of nut as well - macadamias work great! If using larger chocolate chips (in lieu of chopping up a bar), put the chips through the food processor or chop them a little - the big chips that companies like Ghiradelli make can be a little large for cookies like these.

These were really good. I wanted to make the coconut flavor more robust, so i used half butter and half coconut oil in step 1 and added 1 tsp of coconut extract. The flavor was great and I like the crunchy texture on the outside. I thought they were fantastic! For the second batch, I also added orange zest and cranberries, and I thought they were great too. I recommend flattening them out well too- i didn't flatten out a few and they were more cakey than i wanted.

Made these last night and they were SO good. Used sweetened coconut, as that is what I had on hand, and did not omit the white sugar, as other reviewers recommended. Would definitely make again.

substituted 1/4 cup of coconut flour (for regular flour), and 3/4 cup of coconut oil + 1/4 cup applesauce for butter. Did not put in white sugar.

I amended the recipe just slightly. Instead of 2 cups of choc chunks, I used 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chips and 1/2 cup chopped dried sour cherries. The best oatmeal cookie ever. Huge hit with everyone who had one!

Not sure I have much to add to 200 reviews, but I would only add that you can be super lazy and they still turn out great. I whisked together microwaved butter and brown sugar (too lazy to find my handmixer, plus I only wanted to wash 1 bowl). I added (frozen) sweetened coconut and (frozen) slivered almonds, no toasting or defrosting. I only had about 1/3 the chocolate chunks, so I substituted the remainder of chocolate with Hershey's cinnamon chips. WOW! I did reduce the granulated sugar and added 1 cup of craisins.

My husband loves these cookies, with some of the modifications that I have made. First, as recommended by other reviewers, I use sweetened coconut and omit the white sugar. Second, I always add extra vanilla. Third, I usually use pecans, since walnuts make my mouth itch. Fourth, I omit the chocolate chips altogether.(primarily because I makes the best chocolate chip cookies with a recipe that I created, so I wanted something different....) I sometimes sub out half the flour for whole wheat, giving the cookies an even nuttier flavor and slightly different texture. Bottom line, hubby loves these because they are not too sweet the way I make them....... The dough does freeze beautifully......

Yum. Would not change a thing.

These were disappointing - Just OK (and they have all of my favorite ingredients)! I tried several times to make it right, but they were never ideal. The coconut and oatmeal are too similarly textured and make a mucky cookie. The coconut taste does not come through (I even tried toasting the coconut in one batch). The almonds also get lost in the mix - maybe pecans or macadamias would be better? Also tried a batch with sweetened coconut with only 2 TB sugar - but they were not sweet enough this way. They seem to also need more salt. Will probably just start fresh with a different recipe. A good recipe shouldnt take this much work to make perfect!

Rating: 4
These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I used walnuts because that was what I had on hand. I thought the unsweetened coconut was great and would differ from other reviewers who liked sweetened better. The larger cookies held together better than some smaller ones I tried--there could be a bit less chocolate and nuts in order for them to be less crumbly but we loved them!

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I took advice of many previous reviewers: sweetened coconut, no granulated sugar, extra chocolate chips. Also, I used whole wheat flour, REALLY dark (85%) chocolate, and added several handfuls of finely chopped, mixed, dried fruit. I used parchment paper and let them cool in the pan for added crispness.

An absolute favorite in our family. Always put a sprinkling of kosher salt on top of each cookie, though--it makes all the difference.

My new favorite cookie recipe. The texture and denseness was perfect and everyone loved them! I followed the advice of others and used sweetened coconut and skipped the granulated sugar. The coconut toasts fast so watch it closely in the oven. I used chocolate chips - Guittard. I skipped the nuts because I prefer to bake cookies without nuts when baking for a crowd. You may want to experiment with the baking temperature on your oven, 350 at 15 minutes seemed ideal for mine. The dough freezes well, I made a batch a week ahead and then thawed in the fridge and baked them.

Interesting and tasty cookie. I played with it and tried some with chocolate chips, some plain, and some with craisins - the craisins were best by far. It is a fairly sweet, buttery cookie so the tartness of the cranberries gave it a deeper, more complex flavor. I do recommend refrigerating the mixture before trying to form it - it is very buttery and will melt in your hands.

Also, I don't use nuts in these cookies because I don't like nuts in dessert (except for peanut butter) and they are even better!

I love this recipe! It definitely doesn't take one hour in total, probably more like forty-five, and they are exceptional! I make a half-recipie, but always come out with over two dozen cookies. I add in a little extra vanilla and coconut, but they are so delicious, and not labor-intensive, and I make them every weekend now.

These cookies were EXCEPTIONAL, probably the best I've ever had. The delicious combination of coconut, chocolate, and oats blended together to make the perfect cookie. If you don't like rich or sweet things, don't make these, but everyone else, definitely make these. All my friends ask me to make them every day.

Rating: 3
these cookies were OK. flavors are good - i added a sprinkle of salt on top of cookies prior to baking as one reviewer suggested and that was a yummy contrast to the sweet of chocolate & coconut. omitted the granulated sugar since i had sweetened coconut on hand. the cook time was drastically different for me than instructed, however. The first two pans of cookies had to be thrown out because they were too brown & crispy - and i only had them in the oven for 14 minutes - and rotated halfway thru as instructed. the remaining batches I baked for only 8-10 minutes and these were much better, still crispy but not burned. might make them again but definitely not a MUST HAVE recipe for me.

I am shocked at the positive reviews for these cookies. I made them as written, except for using walnuts instead of almonds, which seems a common substitution. They really lacked any complexity of flavor, just tasted like sweet oats & coconut. A little too much butter & way too much coconut. We didn't even eat these.

My daughter who loves sweets intoduced me to the making of these mouthwatering confections that are so very easy to prepare. I form the batter into logs and freeze. When company comes to visit I then fresh bake so they are warm and crisp. All six of my grandchildren, 7 and under, adore them however I had to omit the almonds because two of the little rascals are too young for nuts.

Rating: 4
The only cookie I make now. I generally add extra oatmeal (perhaps to convince myself that makes it more nutrious?) and on occasion raisins as well. We prefer smaller cookies so I portion them out with a small scoop. Helpful to chill the batter first and smoosh the portions down a little before baking. Oh, so good!

I love this cookie! I made it for some of my Parisian friends and now am famous throughout the city for my delicious cookies. I made a few minor tweaks: I used only brown sugar rather than brown and white; I omitted the coconut; I used toasted walnuts rather than almonds; I used half semisweet chocolate and half Lindt milk chocolate with crunchy caramel; and, most importantly, I sprinkled each cookie with Baleine sea salt (about a pinch) before putting them in the oven.

Wow! Just taste tested the first batch from the drying rack and understand why this recipe gets such rave reviews. In fact, I had my heart set on a whole basket of classic chocolate chip cookies for a party, and I did make 4 dozen such cookies earlier today, and after a much anticipated first bite, I tasted just enough of an irritating baking soda aftertaste to make me start all over with something new. This is my new classic chocolate chip cookie recipe! Yum! We'll see if they make it all the way to the party.

a good, rich cookie for a snowy day. I didn't quite have a cup of brown sugar, so I added 2 tbsps of white sugar, but omitted the other 4 tbsp called for. Really, really not necessary, even with unsweetened coconut. It's a very sweet cookie, but also great, delicate texture thanks to the oats and coconut. I only used a cup of coconut, btw.

I like my oatmeal cookies dense and chewy and these did not disappoint. After reading reviews, omitted white sugar to offset sweetened coconut, substituted chopped toasted walnuts for almonds, chilled in the fridge, used parchment and decreased baking temp to 360. Baked full 18 minutes to a golden brown for 24 cookies. Well, now there's only 22....

I absolutely love these. I didn't have any coconut on hand though, so I adjusted the recipe as follows: added 1/2 cup almonds and 1/2 walnuts (instead of 3/4 cup almonds), increase oats to 3 cups, and added 8oz semi-sweet chocolate instead of a cup. They came out exceptionally at 350F for about 10 min.

These were a great way to use up all that holiday baking stuff. I used a can of sweetened coconut, walnuts, chocolate chunks, chips and a few butterscotch with the oatmeal. Yummy! They will make great care package cookies for my son in college. 350 for 12 min was perfect for mine!

I tend to be a chocolate chip cookie purist - I usually don't go for additions like nuts and coconut, but in light of the great reviews I thought I'd give this recipe a go! I accidently slightly burned my almonds during the roasting which wasn't a bad thing; gave it the flavour some added depth. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews prior and baked them at 375, which was too high. That being said, they still turned out quite well. Enjoyed a couple with a cup of tea, which made for a lovely treat. Nice change from the ordinary, but I'll stick to straight-up chocolate chip oatmeal as my go-to recipe.

These cookies came out really well! Great chewiness without being cakelike. More like a sinful soft granola. It can be doubled with no problem. Variations are that I ground up oats in a coffee mill to make 1 cup (1/2 C for one batch) oat flour. I didn't add the white sugar, used milk chocolate, added currants and subbed pecans for almonds. Also added dark cocoa powder for 1/4 of the flour. Tried to take away the forks for these changes, but it was too late! They were a breeze with parchment paper. I needed to wait more than one minute before moving some of the cookies, but after about 5 minutes, they are ready to move. Also, be really vigilant about not letting the bottoms burn. Some got a little too dark for gift-giving.

This is the second year I've used this recipe, and I love it! I cut out the nuts because my husband hates them, and use half choc. chunks and half holiday MMs to make a beautiful holiday cookie. To counter potential burning, I use parchment paper, and do not leave them in any longer than 15 min. They continue to brown after they leave the oven. Mmmmmm.

Had a craving for an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, came across this one and decided to try it. This was one of the easiest and yummiest cookies I have ever made. The texture is just perfect. I only had sweetened coconut, so I followed other users advice and omitted the white sugar. I only had demara brown sugar and it worked wonderfully. Next time, I will use maybe only 3/4-1 cup of coconut because I felt it a teeny bit overpowering (and I usually like coconut in cookies). All in all, for sure, this one is a keeper.

The best oatmeal cookie ever. I sometimes add raisins too along with the chocolate chips. I prefer to make them up as smaller cookies -- otherwise they'd disappear too fast! I recommend chilling the dough before cooking.

Great cookies! I did add a little cinnamon and omitted the white sugar because I used sweetened coconut. There is no need to pat down the cookie dough as they tend to flatten considerably during baking. I also made them smaller than what the recipe calls for and they took about 12 minutes to bake.

I made these cookies to sell at a theater group and I had people tell me it was the best cookie they ever had. I used Lindt white chocolate with coconut, dried cranberries and pistachos. Reduced the coconut and white sugar. They are delicious and it's a fun recipe to play around with.

These were very good. Made a few changes: no nuts because of allergies and added 1/2c more of flour as the 1st batch was too flat for my liking. I like a thicker cookie so I what I ended up doing for the 2nd round was to make smaller rounds piled "high" (did not press down on them) in order to make them thicker and it seemed to have helped.

Wow, what great versatile cookies! have fun and play with these!! I had sweetened coconut so omitted sugar, used about 10oz of semisweet chips and didn't go with the nuts. Baked at 350 for 10 min. on midack and then 3 on top rack. I ended up with 22 cookies so next time i may double the recipe for more yummies!

Yum! I used 3 TBSP white sugar, less chocolate, and less coconut. Also, I put the dough in the fridge for a few minutes, formed the cookies and placed the cookie sheets in the freezer for a few minutes. Bake at 350 for about 12 minutes. I would definitely make these again!

I made these for my dad who is recovering from surgery. He called to say, "Call Kizito (a local gourmet cookie establishment) and tell them to move over! Your cookies are much better!"

Substituted: - coconut= 1 cup sweetened coconut - chunk chocolate = chocolate chips - vanilla = 1 tbsp. -sugar = 4 tablespoons Recipe was absolutely delicious.

My husband was looking for cookies, which I don't keep in the house, so I decided to make some and found this recipe to use the ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have coconut or chocolate. Following advice from other reviewers, I only used 1/2 amount of granulated sugar. I used raisins; again no coconut and no chocolate. I really liked how they came out and can't wait to make them again with chocolate. NOTES: I wasn't in a rush, so I only make one tray of one dozen at a time. First tray spoon was too small and cookies were flat and too crispy. Next few trays I used table spoon drops, almost towers and I put the dough in the fridge between cooking so they really stood stiff. Cooked for 13 minutes in middle of oven and cooled 2 minutes on tray. Used silpat. Lovely!

Fabulous cookies! I omitted the granulated sugar and used half whole wheat flour, half white. These cookies were still very sweet. I think I'll try white whole wheat flour next time. Also, I only had semisweet chocolate chips, so I used two cups of those --easy and delicious. I made them for our week at a summer cabin last year and my mother asked me to bake them again for this year's trip. Absolutely scrumptious!

Delicious!

This is my favorite cookie recipe. I use 1/2 cup of wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all purpose flour. I add 3/4 cup of cranberries instead of the almonds.

Everyone who eats these cookies with the modifications I have made, always ask for the recipe.

This is instantly by far my now favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe! The textures are wonderful - crunchy, soft and chewy all in one bite. Usually for a cookie this size, I'd eat a part or a half and my sweet tooth would be satisfied, but with this one, I couldn't stop eating the cookie and had to refrain from eating a second one right then and there. It was a big hit with the group I served this to, and I'll most definitely be making this again!

So good! I followed another reviewer and halved the white sugar, only used one cup of sweetened shredded coconut and did not use almonds.

While these cookies certainly were delicious, they didn't turn out the way I expected/hoped. These cookies flattened out completely in the oven to give very thin and chewy disks rather than thicker more substantial cookies. I tried chilling the dough, but it didn't seem to have any effect. I also found that they do not need to be baked nearly as long as the recipe suggests. These are great, flavorful cookies if you're looking for something thin and chewy, but I think that next time I will add some more flour in hopes of getting a thicker cookie.

I have been baking these cookies since I got the recipe in 2001! They have always been a huge hit and I even like them and I am not a cookie person. I have made this recipe many types of ways. What ever you do, do NOT substitute margarine for the butter!! You can also substitute dried cranberries, raisins or cherries for the chocolate and they all will work out just fine. Chocolate chips work out well with them too. I have a feeling that any type of dried fruit will work out just fine in them. One time I forgot to put the flour in them and they were very lacy and chewy. I was going to toss them out, but everyone still wanted them. Even those were eaten up quickly-ha. If you are considering making them for the first time, GO FOR IT! You will not regret it!

WOW! I bake a lot and this chocolate chip cookie is the best I ever had! I think I could eat this for breakfast, a midafternoon snack or dessert. Thier bigger than usual and have a very healthy kind of texture to them with the oatmeal, they hold up well. The coconut is great toasted. And make sure to butter the bottom of the pan... I used salted butter and the salt is a great contrast to the sweetness of the cookie, I'm sure unsalted butter would do just as well. I omitted the almonds and added Pecans and baked at 350 oven. I used Ghiradelli Semisweet Chocolate Chips! AWESOME! I will make this cookie again and again!

Rating: 4
These were a hit at work and at home! I used pecans instead of almonds and butterscotch chips instead of chocolate. Delicious! I have always used chocolate chips in the past for oatmeal cookies but I prefer the butterscotch, and it makes it a little different from the mainstream cookie. Some would argue this change makes it a completely different recipe but the dough was the same - and these would have been good even without any chips.

Rating: 4
Perfect! I, like a lot of the reviewers, actually changed this recipe quite a bit, but still feel the original was deserving of the four-fork review. I was actually looking for a recipe to try and duplicate cookies sent to me from an 'artisan' bakery from back home (called "Chocolate Salty Oats" cookies), and fiddled with this until I got it right. I used only 1 cup of UNsweetened coconut, halved the amount of granulated sugar, and omitted the nuts. Then, before baking, I sprinkled just a bit of sea salt on the tops of the cookies. (DO use cool ingredients and sheets.. otherwise the cookies spread too much.) It sounds strange, but the chocolatey/sweet and salty combo is to die for. Yummy! I personally prefer my version, but the original is also delicious. Happy Baking!

Thanks to all the reviewers of this recipe!! I deleted the white sugar and used the sweetened coconut (not toasted). I added a cup of plumped raisins (soaked in hot water for 15 minutes and drained well). I used the Nestle's Premium 62% cacao chocolate chips plus some semisweet chunks because I love dark chocolate. No almonds were added but I did add a pinch of cinnamon. I made the dough and chilled it as recommended. The best baking results were to only put 8 small cookies on a single tray and bake at 350 for 10 minutes. on parchment. YUMMY!!!!!

These cookies were wonderful - full of lots of interesting flavors and textures. I used sweetened coconut and completely eliminated the white sugar which resulted in the perfect amount of sweetness to my thought. I chilled the dough well, used a 2-1/4" scoop, lowered the temp to 350 and baked for about 14 min. This resulted in 24 mounded 3" cookies - didn't spread much at all. Because they didn't flatten out a lot as many have reported, they were quite soft and chewy which is definitely how I prefer them. Next time, I think I'll cut the amount of coconut to 1 cup. These cookies were delicious...my true test is how they hold up having been frozen as I make tons of cookies to keep on hand in the freezer for teenagers! Will report back on that...

Possibly the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever made. To save prep time, I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips and substituted pecans for the almonds, which are easier to chop. Also added a pinch of cinnamon. Average-sized cookies baked 12-15 min turned out just fine and yielded 5-6 dozen, not to mention (somewhat) less guilt for holiday nibblers than the suggested XXXXL size. This one's a keeper!

YUM!! I made a batch of these cookies last night and they are superb. I took the advice of some previous readers and baked them at 350 degrees. With the first batch, I slightly flattened each mound and I found that the edges of the cookies started to really get brown before the middle set. So, for the following batches, I just scooped 1/4 cup mounds of dough onto the cookie sheets and they were fine. I added some raisins, used semi-sweet chips, sweetened coconut and reduced the sugar to 5 tbsp. This recipe is a keeper, I'll definately makes these again.

Wow! I've never been a fan of oatmeal cookies, but made this recipe because I was looking for an energy bar for my husband. I'm a convert now. I substituted raisins for the chocolate, toasted the coconut, added 1/4 cup flax seeds and used walnuts instead of almonds. Followed another rater's advice and spread in 9x13 pan, baked at 350 for 30 minutes also, and ended up with the most scrumptious energy-packed bar cookies. I'll be making this recipe regularly.

Followed the directions to a T, cookies definitely came out lacy as opposed to nice rounded edges. Tasted good, can't go wrong with coconut, almonds and chocolate but definitely a little heavy in the buttery grease factor.

Rating: 0
P.S. My cookies turned out EXACTLY like the photo - eg. they were not "flat" or "lacy". Perhaps other readers used margarine instead of butter? I was careful to not over grease the sheets and rinsed them with cold water between batches, a warm pan will also cause cookies to spread too much. I used refrigerated butter as opposed to room temperature (the mixer was able to break it down easily), which can also make a difference. Use eggs straight from the refrigerator to keep the mixture cool.

This was a great recipe. I followed other suggestions and toasted my coconut. Next time I will not toast the coconut as the cookies could have been a little more moist for my liking. May have been my oven - came with the apartment and it stinks, I always have to reduce the temperature by about 25 to 50 degrees and bake on the top rack or else things come out "black bottom". I used regular semi-sweet chocolate chips and filberts, tasted great! Very filling - ate like a meal!

Rating: 2
The cookies tasted bland except for the chocolate chunks, may have tasted better with sweetened coconut. Furthermore, I agree with previous reviews that they were hard to get off of the pan. The array of ingredients causes the cookies to be too unstable and they fall apart. Too much work that leads to a mess of half crumbled cookies.

Rating: 4
Just finished making these cookies. They are superior to any choc. chip cookie I have tasted!!! The complexity of textures (with coconut chewiness, smooth chocolate and crunchy almonds) make this cookie a true winner!! We started making our Xmas cookies yesterday and this one was by far the best we have ever made. Thanks to the viewers for their numerous reviews. I chose this recipe based on the reliability of the rating. When close to 150 people have rated this cookie with 92% favor, it seemed like a good risk to take.

Rating: 2
I really expected to love this cookie since the batter tasted great! The ingredients are good but I had a hard time getting them off the pan because they were very lacy cookies. Parchment paper helped but I probably would just add the oatmeal and coconut to my standard toll house cookie recipe.

Rating: 4
I am a veteran cookie baker, and this has become one of my "Top 5 Hall of Fame" cookie recipes. My version, created partly from various reader comments, includes cutting out all the white sugar; using ordinary Baker's sweetened coconut and ordinary slivered almonds (conveniently eliminating all prep for the almonds except toasting in a nonstick skillet over medium heat); toasting the coconut and the oats together on a large rimmed cookie sheet in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes, then allowing to cool before stirring into batter; and using Nestle Toll House chocolate chips. Forget the complicated two-cookie-sheet thing, just use one at a time and bake for 11 minutes. You will only need to do that twice. These huge, crunchy, not-too-sweet cookies always draw raves.

Rating: 4
WOW! If you like coconut, chocolate and oatmeal, this is your lucky day!!! I added 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour for the fun of it, omitted the white sugar since I used toasted sweetened coconut. I toasted macadamia nuts and the oatmeal. I doubled the recipe because I had a feeling they'd be winners!!! Otherwise I followed the ingredients exactly... I made them "ice cream scoop" sized for 12 minutes at 350 convection. YUM!!!

Rating: 3
Mmmm, late night chocolate chip craving immediately satisfied. I think I ate 5 of them. Sweetened coconut, only 4tbsp white sugar, roasted walnuts instead of almonds, added some cinnamon, nutmeg and powdered ginger. I might have been short on butter, but whatever, these were delectable.

Rating: 4
This recipe was fantastic! I used sweetened coconut like many other reviewers and chocolate chips instead of chocoatle chunks. I only had about a cup of chocolate chips but the cookies don't seem to need more than that. My boyfriend is still talking about these cookies a week and a half later. Everyone who tried them loved them. Definitely a standard recipe from now on.

these are delicious cookies, one of the best i've ever had. i toasted the (unsweetened) coconut first and omitted the almonds. perfectly chewy. don't overbake them, they crisp up nicely on the outside even when slightly underbaked. oh, also, don't let the picture discourage you, they are much prettier than the picture.

Rating: 4
This recipe was terrific, although, I did not exactly follow it completely... I used sweetened coconut (which I toasted) and eliminated the granulated sugar. I also substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips. Finally, I used the batter to make bars instead of cookies. Baking it at 350 for 30 minutes in a 9 by 13 inch pan yielded delicious, chewy bars.

This recipe has replaced my tollhouse recipe that I have made for years. It is the best!!!! chocolate chip cookie recipe. Unsweetened coconut and bittersweet chocolate are a must, and I use walnuts or macadamia nuts instead of almonds. Delicious!!!!

INcredible. I'm and avid baker and have made countless cookie recipes, and this one is one of the best, by far. The cookies bake up thick, moist and chewy with the just the very edges crisp for the perfect textural contrast. The flavor is rich and outstanding, granted I made some additions and substitutions: I used sweetened coconut and decreased the sugar to 4.5 T, milk chocolate chunks from candy bars instead of bittersweet, walnuts instead of almonds b/c that's what I had, 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon and a large ripe yet firm banana, quartered and sliced (add the bananas after mixing all of the other ingredients). Since there were so many "chunks" in my batter, I made slightly smaller cookies and baked them for only 12 minutes and baked only one sheet at a time. They were fantastic and chock-full of goodness in every bite. Everyone raved about them, even the chocolate chip cookie purists.

Loved these cookies! Sub'd pecans, and toasted the nuts, oats, and coconut - great results.

Rating: 4
I feel like I shouldn't REALLY rate this recipe because I hardly followed it...I used more of the idea of this recipe because I had almost the right ingredients but not quite. I used whole wheat flour instead of apf, chocolate chips and sweetened coconut (I cut out the white sugar and found them to be the right sweeteness). I also toasted sliced almonds and crushed them a little bit when thy came out of the oven. They are delicious! Crispy on the edges and chewy inside. I do see the point of some reviewers saying that the cookies have too much coconut. I don't think the coconut taste overpowered the cookie, but the texture is more like a coconut cookie than a oatmeal cookie. But WOW...so yummy. I will definitely make these again.

Rating: 4
This cookie gets raves from everyone and requests to make more keep pouring in! I use sweetened coconut, decrease sugar to 4 tablespoons and substitute pecans for almonds. I also toast both the coconut and pecans (sometimes the oatmeal as well). It really brings the flavor up a notch and has been the favorite of all my "taste testers". White chocolate chunks can be substituted for those who dislike chocolate. (Hard to believe but they do exist)! Try this cookie, the only regret you may have is that you will be in the kitchen baking more often.

Since I only had time to make a quickie version of these cookies, I heeded the advice printed here. I used sweetened coconut (and lessened the called-for sugar) and used chocolate chips. they still were delicious! excellent toasted almond flavor too. although next time I hope to prepare them as directed here. This recipe is a keeper.

gooooood cookies... the key is to chill dough before baking, gives the cookie more shape AND tastes better because of the way it bakes.

The first time I made these I wasn't that impressed. I used regular sweetened coconut and thought nothing of it. I happened to come across the unsweetened variety in a health food store and bought some to experiment. I decided I had to try these again, because so many people loved them. Well.... the unsweetened coconut made ALL the difference. It turns this recipe from average to WOW!!! This quite possibly might be the best cookie I've ever eaten.

Rating: 3
Really good cookies--I'm baking as I type but sampled a hot one from the oven. I nixed all the white sugar and used sweetened coconut. I always use a 1/2 mix white and whole wheat flour when I make any oatmeal cookie (they are more chewy and just a bit more hefty) as I did with this recipe. Used bittersweet chocolate and toasted the coconut as one reviewer suggested. Didn't use nuts so just added more flour mixture. Excellent balance--not too sweet and very chewy.

A Fabulous cookie! I use sweetened coconut and decrease the amt of sugar and use semi-sweet choc chips. My mom and dad raved so I have given her the recipe (several times) and it is now her signature cookie. Everyone loves these! SO GOOD!

This is a superb cookie, liked by family and friends. Difficult to find a cookie that everyone likes, but this is IT! I toasted half the oatmeal and coconut for contrast in textures.

I was swayed by all the positive reviews but was very disappointed. This recipe should have been called Coconut chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies. Found the coconut to be overwhelming and it left an aftertaste of grits of coconut. (I used fine unsweetened coconut as call for in the recipe) Don't try this recipe unless you really like coconut.

Nice treat, something different from the usual cinnamon-and-raisins oatmeal cookie. I didn't have almonds on hand, so subbed untoasted chopped pecans. Fyi, a good source for unsweetened coconut is an Indian grocery.

I made this the first time with sweetened coconut because I had it on hand (and cut down the sugar to 5T). It was way too sweet! (although my coworkers liked them). The second time I used unsweetened coconut and used less chocolate chips than in the recipe. It was excellent. I like them with pecans. Definitely go with unsweetened coconut. I'll be making this chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on.

Watch out! These cookies could be addictive. I don't know whether it's the texture, or the chocolate, nutty, coconut flavors that are distinguishable separately and combine wonderfully. I got crispy edges and a soft, but chewy center by baking them only 12 minutes. I also successfully froze some of the dough and made another batch after the first disappeared so quickly. I had sweetened coconut, so I used that, but will try the unsweetened next time, and I used chocolate chips. I think they'll be even better. I had no problem with just a buttered baking sheet. I cooled them for a couple of minutes on the sheet before transferring to a cooling rack. I think I've found my favorite chocolate chip cookie.

Yummy! I just made these and everyone is raving how good these are. Someone even asked if I bought them at a bakery! I followed the recipe as is, except I used chopped pecans instead of almonds. I purchased them pre-chopped and then toasted them per the directions in the recipe. I also chilled the dough first and used parchment paper. They came out perfect after baking for 15 minutes at 350. They were moist and chewy and not flat at all. I'm not sure why people were having separation problems - mine were still a couple of inches apart when done. I have a feeling I'll be making these lots in the coming year.

Very tasty cookie. Definitely chill dough, definitely use icecream scoop, definitely use parchment paper. These smaller cookies must come out of the oven earlier, start checking from about 8 minutes. Most of my cookies were great, a couple flattened on each tray I baked, I don't know why . It certainly didn't affect the taste, they all tasted wonderful.Followed recipe almost exactly, used chocolate chips and fresh grated coconut. These cookies definitely took longer to pull together than regular choc. chop cookies but all in all the time was worth the taste.

I have written a review previously and am writing again because I have made this recipe SO many times and wanted others to know that you can make substitutions beautifully in this recipe. If you don't have unsweetened coconut, use regular sweetened and reduce the sugar. You can make these cookies smaller, but make bake time 11-12 minutes. They come out fabulous . . . time and time again! Lori

I love the taste of these cookies. Something different than the average chocolate chip. I had some trouble the first batch I made as the cookies burned a bit on the edge before the center was cooked. The second batch I took a previous reviewers tip and used an ice cream scoop to shape, didn't flatten, and baked them at 350. They turned out perfect.

I substituted walnuts for the almonds and used regular store bought coconut (as a result I used 5 table spoons of sugar instead.) And, to really make them extra yummy I added a 1/2 cup of chopped dates!

I thought these came out good. I made them by the rounded tablespoon and flattened. Used butter flavored crisco instead of butter (I think it makes a chewier cookie) and didn't have almonds so I used hazlenuts. Also used sweetened coconut as it was all I had. After tasting the first batch, I added cranberries to the last batch. Good and different than the norm!

Rating: 3
These were terrific! Very homey, like something a 1950's mom would've had waiting for her kids after school with milk. My family loved them. I made them smaller too (too much of a good thing...) and baked them as per the previous reviewer's suggestion. Will make again gladly.

Rating: 3
Definitely not your run of the mill chocolate chip cookie. I think the coconut taste could have been a bit more pronounced, though. I may substitute the sweetened variety next time, and reduce the white sugar slightly to balance. I used a rounded ice cream scoop to form the cookies (smaller than recommended) and did not flatten. Baked for 10-12 minutes in the middle of the oven (350 degrees) on a Silpat. Turned out golden brown, soft and chewy.

Rating: 3
Wow were these good! I wasn't sure what to expect, as there were so many add-ins it didn't look like my dough came together, but they turned out perfect. I followed the directions precisely, but could not find unsweetened coconut and made them with regular. They looked exactly like the picture! Nice and chewy, wholesome tasting, and the chocolate was not overwhelming. They seemed very old-fashioned. I will definitely make these again!

I thought these cookies were amazing. I toasted the coconut- I think it added a little crunch to it. I also made a small batch for my husband who hates chocolate using dried cranberries and white chocolate- was a hit!

Very good, but very sweet cookie. Expect very stiff dough by the last cup of oatmeal. The basic recipe is great and (I hope) will easily accomodate some tinkering. Next time, I'm omitting the chocolate chips - but may add cranberries as one writer suggests. Watch the baking time. My first tray burned at 12 minutes.

I am definitely pleased w/the recipe!!! I love the texture from the chocolate, almonds and coconut. The oatmeal gives it a wonderful harmony in your mouth! I followed the suggestion to mix the dry ingredients and it worked well. I also altered the recipe by lowering the temp to 350 F, and used sweetened coconut. When roasting almonds, 3-4 minutes is more approp. for golden color. This is a fabulous recipe!!!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time they came out perfectly, both in taste and appearance. The second time I used Silpat instead of butter on the cookie sheet and they were completely flat. Has anyone else had this experience with Silpat? It was the first time I had ever used it and now I'm afraid to use it again. I'll make the cookies again because they are really outstanding, but I will follow the instructions faithfully!

Rating: 3
Overall I think this is a great recipe - very flavorful. However - I made them smaller than 1/4 cup each and I think there was too much butter in them for that size. I also think the oven was far too hot for the smaller cookies - try 1.5 cups butter and a 325 oven. All in all they were great! I made half with choc. chips and almonds, the other half with dried cranberries and both were yummy (though with choc. chips they are decadent). Enjoy!

Rating: 3
I suggest when making any kind of cookie, that you combine the dry ingredients together (in this case, flour, baking powder and salt), and either wisk or sift them together and add to butter/sugar mixture in a few (3-4) smaller additions rather than all at once. This will save you from getting a chunk of baking powder in a bite of cookie, which to a baker, means certain death. By the way, these were a hit at work! I'll definately make them again.

I thought these would be wonderful. I made half a recipe, and used half bittersweet chocolate and half semisweet. I used unsweetened coconut I'd grated and frozen earlier. First of all, the cookies burned the first five minutes in the oven -- while the middles were raw. I kept them in the whole time. They were a terrible disappointment, what with the special chocolate and real coconut. What a waste. The cookies tasted bland and boring, besides being burned.

Rating: 4
The cookies were a bit flatter than what I was used to and not very visually appealing. That said, they were incredibly delicious! I used a fancy imported bittersweet chocolate (Feo Dor or something like that), but could only find sweetened coconut. The bitterness of the chocolate balanced the sweetness of the coconut, so I won't bother looking for unsweetened coconut the next time I make the recipe. If I were going to make the cookies for kids, I would definitely use semisweet rather than bittersweet chocolate, as the bittersweet definitely makes for a more grown-up cookie!

Rating: 3
These cookies are insane! Very tasty right out of the oven, a little hard the next day. Next time I won't flatten the cookies (they spread enough on their own) and I'll only cook them for the minimum time. Still, these are delicious, a great and decadent cookie.

I didn't like these at all. I found them bland and greasy. The large amount of coconut makes the dough unmanageble, so they have to be made very large. I used sweetened coconut because that's what I had, so maybe the unsweetened makes a difference.

These are not "standard" chocolate chip cookies. If that's what you're looking for, try a different recipe. If you're looking for something a little unique though, definitely give these a try. They're wonderful. Rich, without being too sweet, and incredibly flavorful. Even my friends who don't typically eat many cookies love these. Undercook them just a little in order to get a slightly crisp outside and a soft and chewy inside. Delicious!

I omitted almonds and only had milk chocolate and sweetened coconut on hand, but they were still delicious, though not very attractive, as others have mentioned. Mine had a tendency to burn around the edges while still being a bit gummy in the center, so though it may be just my oven, I think next time I would try one at 350 to see if it makes a difference in the spread/edge issue. These are worth making and were quick and easy!

MY NEW FAVORITE!!! I love these cookies! I made some with pecans(for my dad) and the rest without. I didn't bake them as directed, instead, one pan at a time for about 13-15 minutes. They came out soft and chewy the way I like cookies. I plan to make a double batch this weekend!

I tried a slightly drier mix and no nuts and definitely shorten cooking time and temp. Thus: [this is a one-half quantity recipe} 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup packed brown sugar ...Beat together butter and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until fluffy. ....add: 1 large egg ......and beat until just blended, ...... then add in.. 3/4 teaspoon vanilla 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add... 1/2 cup all-purpose flour ...and mix at low until blended. ..Stir in by hand: 1 1/4 cups old-fashioned oats* 1 cup packaged finely shredded unsweetened coconut 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Preheat oven to 350F. Arrange les than 1 Tbsp rounded portins, sing spoon and fingers, on 2 lightly buttered,large baking sheets (about 12 cookies per sheet) . Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position and rotating pans halfway through baking, until golden, about 9 minutes but check for burning on bottoms. Cool cookies on sheets 1 minute, then transfer with a spatula to racks to cool completely. Make more cookies in same manner. Makes about 24 cookies. *Experiment with 1 cup oats.

They aren't pretty but they're delicious! I substituted Skor toffee bits for the almonds and that probably added to the spreading problem. I rolled the dough into just smaller than golf ball size and didn't flatten them. Baking time is too long -- mine were done in 12 minutes on a cushioned cookie sheet but I also live at about 7,000 feet above sea level. I used sweetened coconut because I couldn't take the time to drive around and find unsweetened.

What a delicious recipe. A couple of suggestions. We made the cookies smaller than recommended, it seemed like a lot of dough to us for 1 cookie. Also, watch the cooking time...the time recommended is WAY too long (which may be because we made them smaller). I watched them until the cookies were golden, and they stayed chewy. My new favorite cookies!!

We didn't have unsalted butter, used regular, excluded salt. Definately recommend chilling dough. Will try using butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.

I had such high hopes for these cookies. I chilled the dough for two hours just to make sure I wouldn't have that spreading problem... but I still did! I almost threw the entire (doubled) batch of dough away just because I thought they were ugly. But my boyfriend tasted them and said he would kill me if I didn't make the rest. So, I did... and took them to his relatives' for Christmas dessert... and everyone loved them! People went CRAZY for these cookies! I personally thought they were a bit dry... but who am I to argue with the masses? The one thing... I did use sweetened coconut (couldn't find unsweetened anywhere)... don't know if that had any effect on the outcome... I cut out a few tablespoons of white sugar to make up for the extra sweetening. So, if you're looking for a cookie that can sacrifice some beauty for great taste... evidently this is it!!

I made these cookies twice now and recommend them highly - chewy & yummy. I cut the amount of granualted sugar in half and I didn't use the nuts at all. I also tried the recipe with regular sweetened coconut and they weren't as good. The second time I found unsweetened coconut (at a King Arthur baking outlet store in Norwich Vermont) and it made all the difference. I even made these and put them in tins to mail to my family for the holidays. Enjoy!

these are very good. I think they would be equally good without the nuts too. The last oatmeal chocolate chip cookies i made, i just used the recipe on a package of Ghirandelli chocolate chips and those were just as good, but a bit simpler. but i do recommend this recipe!

Rating: 3
A couple of hints for those of you who are having trouble with the consistancy of the cookies. 1. Never beat the butter and sugar--just mix until blended. Excessive beating increases the flour requirement. 2. Always chill cookie dough after mixing before baking. 3. Also, I increased the flour from 1 cup to 1 and 1/4 cup.

Although I usually can't compete with my daughter-in-law on making cookies, these were great. It was an easy recipe to follow and were a hit with my family. The only difference was in using less sugar than called for. This is definitely on my holiday gift list.

Perfect. Everyone gobbled them up looking for more. My newly acquired icecream scoop handled the stiff dough beautifully and they did not flatten. I'll make them again but this time I'll have UNsweetened coconut on hand.

I agree with previous reviewers that this cookie spread too thin during baking. The cookie tasted great, but it does not compare to the look and texture of a chocolate chip cookie recipe I found on cooksillustrated.com.

Like a lot of other people, I found that the cookies "melted" into very large, thin, crisp sheets. It's not what I was expecting. It still tasted good but I'd prefer more dough. It almost seemed more like candy. Everyone at work liked them, though. Maybe I'll try again sometime and refrigerate the dough.

I am not a cookie lover and I COULD NOT STOP EATING THESE!!! THE BEST COOKIES! Could not find unsweetened coconut, so I aslo cut out some sugar, other than that, I made them as written and they came out perfect! They were giant (they need to be giant with all of the good stuff that is in them!), and did not spread thin while cooking - I did not chill the dough. I used bittersweet Ghiardeli(sp?) chocolate bars that I chopped up. LOVE THEM!

This will be my cookie for this holiday season. I will give them out to all of those I know who like cookies. They melt in your mouth, and are the best cookies I have ever made!

These cookies were just OK. Nothing special and a little too sweet. Cookies were also fairly flat and crispy rather than dense and chewy. Too much "extra stuff" with the oatmeal and coconut, not enough cookie.

AWESOME!!!!!!CHILLING THE DOUGH EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS A GREAT IDEA. ALSO,PARCHMENT PAPER! EVERYONE LOVES THESE COOKIES. THANKS!!

I found at the last minute that all I had were quick oats and sweetened coconut. I made these anyway, just using less sugar. They were still very tasty, and basically an easy cookie to make. Take earlier advice and chill the dough for a little while. They hang together better that way.

WARNING: Don't leave out the coconut and almonds. I did and the dough didn't bind well enough. I followed the instructions perfectly, they tasted great, but they crumbled easliy and weren't all that pretty.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever made. Try it!

Delicious! I refrigerated the dough for about 6 hours, lined the cookie sheets with parchment paper, used an ice cream scoop, baked for 9 minutes - the results were perfect cookies - the whole family loves.

These are incredible! I substituted toffee bits for half the chocolate chips and added tart dried cherries; loved the toffee flavor but next time will add a few more chocolate chips. I switched over to parchment paper and found it really helped keep them from overcooking on the bottoms.

Wow! What a great cookie recipe! I will make this recipe again and again. My guests just loved it!

Incredible cookies! Reminds me a bit of Almond Joy. Took the advice of previous reviewers and froze the dough between batches. Also made smaller cookies and reduced the bake time. Fabulous!

Rating: 4
Nice to know you have a couple of these waiting for you after work! Added chopped walnuts too -- I just used the dough to hold all the stuff together. Otherwise, it's trail mix. These rock!

Rating: 3
Time consuming, but well worth it. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for making the cookies smaller - dropped by the tablespoon full, rather than 1/4 cup.

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've found. I've given them as gifts and taken them to work...at least 10 people have asked for the recipe so far. I use chocolate chips for ease and sometimes pecans instead of almonds!!! Thanks Gourmet!

These were good.I had planned to give them as a gift but they didn't come out looking like gourmet-style cookies.They did spread some too even with chilling.Think if I make them again I will chill them overnite.They are also a bit too delicate to wrap individually for gift-giving.

This recipe is a winner. I love the texture with the oatmeal and coconut. I also used chocalate chips. Next time I think I'll add dried cherries like other reviewers mentioned.

Rating: 3
I refrigerated the dough before baking as other reviewers suggested, and my cookies didn't spread. I didn't have almonds on hand, so I used walnuts. I think the cookies would be better with almonds, though that hasn't hindered consumption at our house! Next time I will make the cookies a little smaller, so they appear less decadent.

Rating: 3
Yummy. I substituted dried cherries for half the chocolate, and used sweetened coconut (cutting the sugar by 2T). Keeping the oven at 375 but keeping the dough in the freezer between batches helped control the spreading.

My brother ate 2 huge cookies right away and my 3 year old nephew asked when his auntie was going to bring some more!! Excellent. Everyone that had a cookie said it was a recipe worth keeping.

These were awesome!!!!! I loved them and so did my entire family...These will become a staple for me

Rating: 3
Delicious! Love the crunchiness from the coconut, oats and the almonds. However, after reading previous reviews about burning problems I lowered the temperature to 350* and used an "air-bake" cooky sheet. I removed the cookies immediately to a cooling rack. No burnt cooky bottoms!

Rating: 3
I used sweetened coconut also, but I used only 4 Tbsp of granulated sugar to compensate. These were tasty, but they didn't spread out, like others had written.

I tried these last night. Actually I didn't finish. First batch - right into the oven. They spread alot. Second batch - stuck in the freezer for a little while, then into the oven. These didn't spread nearly as much for a rounder, higher cookie, which I prefer. So, rest of the batter into the fridge for the night. (It was getting late.) I'll finish them off tonight. BTW - test batches (flat and not so flat) brought into work went very fast.

These cookies are delicious, but they are HUGE!! A bit smaller and you can actually finish one after dinner...

These cookies were delicious! I could not find unsweetened coconut so I used sweetened coconut and they were still delicious. I think I will try someone's suggestion - chilling the cookie dough before I bake them just to see how the cookie differs. I will definitely be making these again!

Thanks for the suggestions. I ended up getting the coconut at GNC. Just made the cookies today. Substituted 1/3 of the semi-sweet with white. Pretty good. I liked the texture of the cookie very much. Buttery crisp with a nice chew. Don't think the white made much difference. Do want to add some raisins next time though.

This is a killer of a cookie, I used chocolate chips and regular sweetened coconut and followed the suggestions to only bake them for 9 or 10 mins. You have to watch them because burn easy--everybody loved them!!!

Rating: 4
Someone gave me this recipe (walnuts not almonds) about 10 years ago - they are fantastic. If you omit the nuts, coconut and chocolate chips and add raisins you have a terrific oatmeal raisin cookie!. (You can find unsweet coconut at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's or a health food or ethnic market that sells nuts/grains in bulk 9th Avenue(?).

These were gourmet bakery quality cookies. They are just as good cold as warm. I adjusted the recipe by leaving out the nuts (the kids don't like them) and using regular chocolate chips. No problem but for the real fancy look the chunks would be better. Definitely keep your eye on them around 9+ minutes bake time.

Amazingly delicious cookies! I made a double batch of dough and froze half. The cookies made with the refrigerator-defrosted dough a week later came out just as good as the first batch.

The addition of coconut and oatmeal makes this recipe a nice change from traditional chocolate chip cookies. Chewy texture. Watch the baking time carefully and check early to avoid them burning.

Rating: 4
Wow! We love this cookie. It took me a couple of tries to get them to come out properly (I kept burning the first batch) but once I got the hang of it, they turned out tasting fabulous! I chilled the dough as other cooks suggested and that works very well - if you're a cookie lover, I highly suggest this yummy recipe!

These cookies are absolutely the BEST!! I loved the size and so did friends. My new favorite cookie!!!

A rockin' good cookie!!! It didn't take nearly as long as the recipe stated, mine were nicely browned at about 9 minutes. I might add some dried cherries next time to up the nutritional value. Definately make this cookie!!!!

I loved these cookies. They were chewy with lots of texture--my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. They were also easy. One more comment: refrigerated vs. room temperature dough made a big difference regarding how much they spread when they cooked, though they were good thick or thin.

Rating: 4
I love these cookies - I have been making this recipe for years, with variations. I use whatever types of bits and pieces I have leftover in my pantry... mini M&M's, chocolate chips, white chips, butterscotch, nuts....whatever is on hand. We always use coconut though, that's what makes them so chewy.

Rating: 3
I used the recipes as it was printed, except that I also made smaller cookies. I baked the cookies in several batches and found that I had better results when I chilled the dough a little and made sure that the cookies were half an inch thick. Took them to a group where they disappeared in a hurry. A nice oatmeal cookie variation.

These cookies are FANTASTIC!! However, I did change the recipe: I used quick oats (instead of old fashioned), walnuts - didn't toast them (instead of almonds) and I made the cookies small - normal sized (instead of big). My recipe made 3 1/2 dozen (instead of 24).
