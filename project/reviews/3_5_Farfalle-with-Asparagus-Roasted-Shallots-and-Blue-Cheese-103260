Followed the recipe exactly until it came time to add an entire pound of blue cheese. Just couldn't do it! It was delicious with a half pound of a very creamy blue cheese I found at Trader Joe's. The flavors were really nice and our guests both went for seconds. Always a good sign. Delicious warmed up the next day as well.

I love the roasted shallots in this recipe, but too have found it a bit dry, so I make a small amount of sauce using some blue cheese and cream and incorporate it in. It makes it more creamy and smooth, plus the cream cuts the sharpness of the blue chesseo. Also I like the heavier texture of panko better than bread crumbs. A keeper, for sure!

I Wowed my friends w/ this recipe. I was living in Europe at the time and found a great Blue cheese- Marscapone mix at the cheese shop. It was so amazing. I also use planko instead of fresh (easier and very good, too) Trick is to use a creamy blue cheese. I give this recipe to a friend of mine and he said it came out awful and pasty (he loved mine) I bet he used a crumby blue cheese. I am making it for him again tomorrow when he comes for dinner - I can't wait, Yummy.

The description of one fork is "okay" and I think that is giving this too much praise. However, I don't think it is a bad recipe, I just don't like blue cheese that much. Some blue cheese on a salad or pizza is great, but this was way too overwhelming for me. I honestly dumped the entire thing in the trash. I even gave it about five test bites to see if the flavor would grow on me...it didn't. I had a bowl of cereal for dinner. If you have mediocre feelings about blue cheese, I would make something else.

I made this dish for a potluck dinner with two other friends. Everyone liked it, though we're all fans of blue cheese. The cheese is rather pungent and adds a distinctive taste to the pasta, which went very well with steak. I'd make it again, but only for people who really like the taste of blue cheese.

I also made some changes to this recipe. I added mushrooms - used dry mushrooms so I could reserve the liquid I used to soften them & add it to the pasta when mixing in the cheese. The combination of the earthy flavors of asparagus, gorgonzola, mushrooms & pine nuts was DELICIOUS! My husband thought it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever made. Also, I used some creme fraiche in addition to the gorgonzola to get plenty of creaminess without overpowering the dish with the strong flavor of the gorgonzola. And finally, I used rigatoni rather than farfalle. I really like the way bits of gorgonzola get caught inside the rigatoni for that surprise pop of flavor!

I've tweaked this recipe a bit to make it a little easier and to make it a little saucier, so to speak. First, I use Panko breadcrumbs instead of fresh which still adds a nice crunchy texture. Then, I add about 1/2 cup of nuts (walnuts or hazelnuts work well) that I toast in the same skillet as I used for the breadcrumbs. I also don't cook my shallots in the oven, I caramelize the shallots on the stovetop for about 25 minutes in a covered skillet. I think you get more even browning, particularly if you cut some of the shallots up so they are all the same size. Next, to the skillet of shallots I add 1 to 2 ladels (about 1 cup) of salted pasta water when I mix in the pasta, cheese and asparagus. I've also used a mix of 1/2 blue and 1/2 mascarpone, it can cut down on the tanginess of the blue cheese, in case anyone finds it too strong. Adding the breadcrumbs and nuts at the very end keeps their crunchy texture, now that you have a slighty saucier texture with the added pasta water.

I've made this several times and it has become a summer staple. It's quick, easy and tasty. I've been able to find single- serving size containers of blue cheese and keep it on hand for a quick dinner. Can be made w/o the bread crumbs but it does make a tremendous difference.

Rating: 2
I was expecting to love this recipe, as all of the ingredients top my favorites list, but it just didn't come together too well. It was far to greasy and heavy for my taste. Perhaps it was partly due to the fact that it is difficult to find high quality blue cheese in Brazil, but even with a good Italian Gorgonzola, I am not sure I would make this again.

My first epicurious review: was she insane to serve this dish to 25?? Our neighborhood throws a progressive New Year's Eve party, so I slipped away from the hors d'oeuvres house just a half hour before folks arrived at our pad for this main course. 'Twas a triumph! We used Bleu d'Aubergne with roasted walnuts on top, and assembled the dish in the deep baking pan in which we'd roasted the scallions. We served simple bow ties, parmesan, butter, and olive oil for the kids, and neighbors brought bread and salad.

Very easy and tasty. I used toasted, chopped walnuts instead of breadcrumbs..nice taste and texture...and I used a few less shallots than called for. Also added a little light cream to help the sauce along and I bet chicken broth would have worked as well. I'll make it again, but personally, probably not for company.

A fast and tasty weeknight meal if I ever had one. Raost the shallots ahead, or put them in the oven as soon as you get home. By the time the water's boiled, the pasta/asparagus is cooked, and the cheese is melted through...they'll be ready.

I love this recipe and make it often - always to rave reviews. You do have to like blue cheese - which we do - and if anything, I go heavy on the called for amount, rather than light. I have tried numerous toppings, and must say breadcrumbs have been our least favorite. I browned some pecans one time when it was the ONLY possibility in the cupboard, and found that to be our winning combination. It really adds another dimension to an already great recipe.

Kind of "icky" recipe. This is the second time I've made it. The first time I HATED it. I thought that I had done something wrong since I love all of the individual ingredients. This time that I made it, I was convinced that it's the recipe that I didn't like, and not my cooking technique. I found this reicpe to be very bitter and bitey. Icky!

Rating: 3
I really like this recipe and have made it several times but I solve the blue cheese problem by mixing about a third of pound of the blue cheese with about 1/2 cup cream cheese. This makes the blue cheese not so strong and it melts better and coats the pasta nicely. I also use less bow ties only 1 pound. This works for me and I really like it.

I've made this recipe twice, and have loved it each time. I'm planning on making it again tonight. I was surprised to see such mixed reviews. If you aren't a fan of blue cheese you probably shouldn't try this recipe. I loved the mix of flavors, and textures. I'd give this four forks but I try to reserve that for out of this world recipes. If you are cooking for folks who can't handle a meat-less main course. Including sliced chicken breasts works well.

If you are worried about the strength of the blue, get a mild one like Saga. The first time I made this, I used Saga and could barely taste the blue. Now I use half blue and have Gorgonzola. Substituting toasted pine nuts for the breadcrumbs makes the dish. I also carmelize the shallots, rather than roast, burt I do roast the asparagus.

I've made this recipe quite a few times, and have always enjoyed it. I would say though that the last time I made this, I took the advice from another reviewer, and substituted toasted pinenuts for the breadcrumbs. This time I also substituted feta cheese for blue cheese and I really think this was the best combination of all. The blue cheese is too bitter in combination with asparagus, and the feta works better (in my opinion).

Rating: 3
It clearly depends greatly on the blue cheese used. My gorgonzola was very gentle & creamy, and the dish was very pleasant & well-balanced. The roasted shallots were especially nice. We will definitely make it again! I think Stilton, which someone else mentioned, would be WAY too strong for my taste.

I made this for a large group as part of a pot luck and didn't get much feedback. I thought it was good but missing something. My husband and I had the lefovers for dinner the same night and really liked the flavors. I used toasted pine nuts instead of the breadcrumbs and I added crumbled, thick sliced bacon for our evening dinner. The bacon really made the dish complete. After sitting a while the blue cheese seemed to absorb into the pasta and mellowed a little. Next time I would add more shallots, they were excellen! Don't reduce the cheese or the dish would become too bland. I used the full 2 pounds of asparagus but reduced the pasta to one 16 oz box - perfect quantities.

I loved this dish! The roasted shallots were so delicious that now I use them on other dishes as well. The only change I made that helped this dish was to reduce the blue cheese to 1/4 - 1/2 lb.(max) and to add 1 cup of chicken broth. It's a nicer sauce.

I really loved the flavors, but I just couldn't get the gorgonzola to melt, even though I first brought the cheese to room temperature. This resulted in a very DRY dish, especially with the breadcrumbs. The flavors are great; I'll definately try it again, but I'll be sure to have a little evaporated milk on hand to help the cheese melt.

This was simple and delicious. Next time I will use Gorgonzola. The Saga Blue was a great discovery since I had never tried it before - but this dish could stand a stronger flavour.

This was exceptionally simple and better tasting than I anticipated. The roasted shallots were a subtle yet important addition. I used lots of gorgonzola and wished there had been more.

Perfect for impressing guests, if they like blue cheese.

Loved it! I wanted to used up some pearl onions so I substituted these along with some cloves of garlic for the shallots, and I used triple cream blue cheese from Germany (brie consistency) that melted wonderfully.

A note on flavor combinations-my husband, who is the head chef at a very well-esteemed local restaurant,was very skeptical when I was making a blue cheese-asparagus-roasted garlic quiche. He liked it once he tasted it, but I do think that you have to love blue cheese for this to work for you. I plan to make this tomorrow, with the substitution of toasted pine nuts for bread crumbs. All kids are NOT the same! Mine(3,11,14) love blue cheese in any type or form(also anchovies)

I made this one pretty much by the book and we loved it. If you can find it, use a really high quality cheese (we used an Italian gorgonzola); it's worth the extra money, since it's one of the dominant flavors. Also, leave the cheese out for an hour or more before and it should melt perfectly. We liked the bread crumbs but thought it was worth making them fresh. Substituted a big, peppery, Australian (southwestern Victoria) Shiraz for the Cotes-du-Rhone, which worked well.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe after going back to my April issue of BA. For the cook from Toronto requesting a substitue cheese, I think a nice soft goat cheese would also work well with this recipe. Also, I loved the shallots, although my husband thought there were too many. The nice thing is that some of the outside layers of the shallots separated while roasting and got nice and crispy -- like a potatoe chip only with a shallot. I might try making an entire bowl of shallot chips.

Rating: 3
This was, all in all, pretty good. I kept everything but didn't use quite as much asparagus as called for, and only 12 shallots as opposed to 24. Although the shallots were definitely a great compliment, 24 would have been just TOO much. I followed the previous cook's advice and warmed the cheese a bit with half and half -- good suggestion, helped spread the cheese easier. Even a picky family ate this!

I made this as a sidedish for my Grandpa on Father's Day. It was a big hit and it's a keeper! This one is easy to do and tastes incredible. A few notes....I cooked 1 1/2 pounds as the recipe called for, but I only needed a bit over a pound. I used a combo of shallots and vidalas - next time I'll use all shallots. Used a mixture of Saga Blue and Gorgonzola - perfect combo. Don't leave off the breadcrumbs -- made for the perfect crunch. In fact, I made more than it called for and kept them for the leftover pasta! (Add them just before serving).

Rating: 3
good but not !GREAT! first, the recipe was halved since there are but two of us. then, i caramelized a vidalia onion, a wonderful & soft french bleu cheese and pencil-thin asparagus. the cheese was warmed with a bit of 1/2 & 1/2 and was creamy and delightful. the cooking time for the asparagus was far too long so i shortened it to a scant 2 minutes for the stalks and an additional 90 seconds for the tips and they were tender crisp. less time for both would have been better. my taller half, who cooks at least as well as i, suggested leaving the bread crumbs out and i agree. they added little flavour/texture and were more of a distraction than an addition. (there was a little, e.g. 2t., of leftover fresh chopped parsley from the previous evening's meal so i threw that in as well. chives would have been a nice addition, in retrospect.) i'll try shallots when i make this again, but the sweet onion was more readily available and less expensive. the dish was served with a bbq sirloin steak, lightly seasoned with salt and crushed black pepper, which was pressed into the steak before it was grilled. the steak was thinly sliced and placed at the side of the pasta in the serving dish (bowl, as suggested). definitely a "do-again" but with adjustments. aren't all good recipes's similarly defined?!?

After reading all the reviews The only ingredient I was sure about was the asparagus, so I caramelized onions with a clove of garlic,crispy fried about 10 slices of bacon chopped, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese more or less, a little cream and of course the asparagus. Mixed the cooked pasta with all the ingredients, sprinkled on a little chilli and it was´delicioso´

I had just been to the farmers' market and picked up tons of Vidalia onions, which I substituted for the shallots. Also used only one pound of pasta - fusilli - and one half pound of crumbled gorgonzola and it was fabulous: easy to make, with a pretty presentation and great flavor. My cheese did not melt into a smooth sauce, but it looked and tasted fine.

I think there are better interpretations of this recipe. I felt the sauce needed a little cream to create a smoother texture. And I question the use of bread crumbs on a non-baked pasta dish? Perhaps pancetta or bacon would have been a better choice.

I liked this dish not only because it's delicious but because you can prepare the ingredients ahead of time. It takes no time to toss it all together. If you want a creamier sauce, the cheese can be cut back by at least a quarter, save some of the pasta cooking water (1/3c, or so), as toss it with the finished dish, before adding the breadcrumbs.

Very easy,very tasty. My very well aged blue cheese did not melt, so I broke it into small pieces and it worked fine.

This put the bread cubes on even footing with the blue cheese and asparagus.

Delicious! Fast, easy. Guests loved it. But I used HALF the CHEESE or LESS, and couldn't have imagined using more! (Very delicious, and very salty, but with less fat.) Other changes: microwaved then flash sauteed sweet onion instead of shallots (had no desire to heat an oven to 375 and then roast shallots/ onions 35 minutes!, though I'm sure they'd caramelize even better.) -And used tri-colored rigotini vs farfalle. Might include bright green peas next time, or substitute green beans or broccoli for asparagus for a change. Maybe add red pepper &/or grated carrot for addtn'l nutrition & color (raw or lightly steamed/ sauteed.) But we'll definitely have this again! PS - don't omit the bread-crumb crunch!

I really liked this dish; it's a sophisticated alternative to mac and cheese that can be served to guests. I used prepared breadcrumbs to make things a little easier.

It was quite simple and good; however, I would say that one must really enjoy bleu cheese. I made the recipe a bit more simple by using store bought breadcrumbs (Progresso). Another slight, but tasty change ~ In lieu of boiling the asparagus, I roasted them on the grill, which I learned from a previous Bon Appetit issue (soak asparagus in water and 2 Tbls Olive oil for 10 mins., then roast on the grill for about 10 minutes - superb!)

This is a fantastic recipe. At first, I thought it would be heavy, especially with a pound of cheese. It was light and very tasty. The asparagus came out tender,yet crisp.
