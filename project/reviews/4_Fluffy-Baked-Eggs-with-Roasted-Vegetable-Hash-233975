Yummy! Easy! I made about a third of this recipe - 3 eggs, etc, and it equaled about 1.5 servings. I made it exactly as directed, and I thought it was perfect.

If you need to prep in advance: Chop all the veggies for hash the night before, layer potatoes on bottom of bowl then the others. I put a lightly damp cloth on top and then saran wrap. The next morning I tossed with olive oil, thyme (as other reviews suggested) s & p and roasted. Added in fresh spinach just before they were done. Delicious. Doubled hash, made two separate casseroles of eggs.

We really enjoyed this - especially the vegetable hash. For some reason the eggs took 2x longer to cook than the recipe states. I used gruyere instead of swiss.

Tried this last night and it was easy & delicious -- somehow, the sum was more than its parts! For 2 people I used 5 eggs, low-fat cheddar, about 2 tablespoons of parmesan, pepper (no salt), and a healthy shake of tabasco sauce. For the veggies I used creminis, fingerling potatoes, shallots, asparagus and a big grind of pepper (again, no salt -- don't normally add it). I made it for dinner and my husband was very pleased -- he said "This reminds me of that wonderful lunch we had in France."

Only made the eggs, but excellent and easy. Omitted the cheese because I was serving it as part of a cheese and bacon biscuit sandwich. GREAT recipe for baked eggs.

Quick, easy and everyone loved it! Next time, I will combine a few yellow potatoes with the sweet ones, just for a change. I was surprised at how perfectly the eggs turned out.

fantastic. Can pan-fry the veg instead if you did not have time before baking eggs. Use less oil for less fat, less greasiness. Truffle salt and cayenne really nice flavor enhancer too. Easily did 1.5X in a 9x13 pan for brunch. Added 3 peppers for that, plus a chopped onion.

So good, but I agree that the egg needs a little spice. Otherwise, this recipe is going in the recipe box.

So easy and delicious! I added spinach to the vegetables and it was lovely!

perfection - trying to use all local ingredients in PA for fall entertaining, menu designed for vegetarians and this recipe is it! I added more onion to the roasted vegetables, perfection!

Made this for a birthday brunch and was a hit. Didn't have sweet potato but used frozen sweet potato fries already seasoned and turned out awesome!

I made this for four people, using 6 eggs and 3/4 cups skim milk for the whole milk. I used cheddar jack instead of swiss cheese and a bag of spinach in the veggies (enough veggies left over for lunch the next day), and it was a hit. I would definitely try cayenne in the eggs next time.

I don't usually do reviews but this recipe meets my excellent rating because it is easy and delicious. It is reasonably healthy (or can be leaned down). I did not change the recipe too much; the sweet potato was great, unusual with eggs. Next time I'll try a more southwest twist with jack cheese and summer squash!

Had this for a lunch for two and it was delicious. I halved the eggs but used the veggies as described (oh I did add some garlic and more onion). Next time I will use cheddar in place of the swiss which didn't have enough flavour for us and will probably add some green peppers to the roasted vegetables. Excellent.

Made this for a brunch we hosted and folks were impressed -- good thing I doubled the recipe. :) I'm lactose intolerant, so I made a few substitutions: water for milk -- which is something I typically do anyway; milk in eggs ruins the nice eggy taste, methinks. Instead of swiss, I used a combo of goat cheddar and jack. I also added some veggie sausage to the egg mixture. Turned out great -- looked good and tasted great!

Oh my gosh, this is so-o-o good I could eat it everyday. Made this for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it! I served it along with a fresh fruit salad, challah, and mimosas. My Mom and everyone else was very pleased. I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this dish for the first time for a brunch I was going to. It got rave reviews from everyone (and I didn't bring home any of it!!). It was also very easy to make - the "hardest" part was the chopping. The sweetness of the sweet potato matched beautifully with the egg and cheese mixture. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is great for an impromtu brunch. It is very tasty and has that special something that will impress your guests but not keep you in the kitchen all morning. I like to chop up the sweet potato and store it in water the night before to keep it from browning. In the morning I chop the mushrooms and shallots, pop the dishes into the oven and 20 minutes later, we have a yummy brunch treat.

This was so delicious. I never have time to do a baked egg recipe because I think of it too late in the morning and everyone just wants to eat. This morning I finally remembered while everyone was sleeping and since I had all the ingredients (except one) I tried this and it was worth it. I did substitute pre-packaged Parmesan cheese for the Swiss, and the contrast between salty/nutty of the cheese with the sweetness of the vegetable hash worked just fine.

This isn't really a review, just a question. I looked at the nutritional information and it said "per serving" but where in this recipe do I find what a serving constitutes? Thanks!!!

Mmm... hash... Really quite a wonderful recipe. I tinkered with it a bit, adding a bit of fresh rosemary to the hash as well as a bit of cayenne to the eggs. Also, I used Jarlsberg as cheese and baby portabella mushrooms in lieu of cremini in my grocery store. Be careful to have the hash and the eggs finish in close proximity to one another. Bon Ap.

An easy, tasty brunch--served with blueberry muffins and mimosas. Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will follow the advice of another reviewer and add some fresh thyme to the hash. I also think the eggs might benefit from a dash of cayenne. In my (always on the slow side) oven, the eggs took much longer to bake (+12 minutes) than expected. (I forgot to move the oven rack up from the middle.)

Amazing. I forgot to put the cheese in the eggs, so I shredded it on top and broiled it for just a couple minutes to melt it after the eggs were browned. Also, I refuse to buy whole milk, so I substituted a cup of 2% cottage cheese - the result was super fluffly light eggs. I added half a bag of de-stemmed fresh spinach to the vegetables after the first ten minutes of roasting. I will probably add the whole bag next time. I will definitely make this recipe again, very delicious and simple.

Good recipe with great flavor and it's a little different from the norm.

My boyfriend surprised me with this for my birthday. He did it a little differently. He added the cheese, mushrooms and sweet potato to the eggs. The result was a fluffy, souffle-like dish. Amazing!

I tend to substitute ingredients often, based on health and what I have available. So, for the eggs, I substituted egg whites for half the eggs, soymilk for whole milk, and added some spinach. Good and fluffy. For the potatoes, I substituted red onion for shallot and added some Italian seasoning. They were excellent. Would definitely make again - was easy to throw everything in the oven together and was really good.

This was very good. The eggs were nice and fluffy and I liked the sweet potatoes and mushrooms. Next time I might add some thyme. My husband loved it and it was very filling.
