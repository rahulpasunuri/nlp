Tip for making these for cheap: Go to a Chinese market and get a bottle of 5 spice powder.

These cookies are very good, but the spices are expensive and the recipe makes entirely too much spice mixture for the amount of dough. Also, if you like your shortbread cookies soft, I would cook them for much less time- 15 minutes and mine were dry and crunchy.

this is a phenominal cookie. i did not parse out the spices as instructed--i have a bottle of Dynasty brand Five Spice, so i used that instead. i find that the cookies are highly addictive: we have been jokingly referring to the cookies as one particularly addictive drug...
