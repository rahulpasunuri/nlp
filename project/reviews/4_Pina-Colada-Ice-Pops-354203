Loved them! My fiance is gluten-free and dairy-free, so this served as his birthday dessert. I don't like rum (and I messed up and used dark rum, thinking it wouldn't make a big difference (but it did)), so I relied on a friend's suggestion and squeezed fresh lime juice on them to cut the heaviness. Loved it! Next time I'm going to add lime juice and toasted coconut to the mixture.

Delicious - we served them for a 4th of July pool party and our guests loved them. This is a keeper!
