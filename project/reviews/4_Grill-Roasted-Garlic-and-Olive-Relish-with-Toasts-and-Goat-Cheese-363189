We've made this appetizer twice-both times it was gobbled up and loved by all. The olive trio was fantastic even though it was a little difficult to locate each variety in the pitted form. Keep looking because each olive has it's own distinct flavor which makes each toast you prepare so amazing. Enjoy every bite!!
