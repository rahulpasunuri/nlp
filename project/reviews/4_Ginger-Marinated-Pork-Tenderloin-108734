Would give this 5 forks, if that was possible - my husband said it was the best meal he'd remembered eating in months. I made this exactly per the recipe (with tomato paste and balsamic vinegar), and served with dijon-balsamic roasted carrots and green beans with lemon & pine nuts (another excellent recipe from this site). We used a slightly larger tenderloin - perfect for two. Our only complaint was that there was a lot of sauce left and nothing to do with it - the recipe could probably serve 3-4 using two tenderloins.

I love this recipe! It's Soooo easy and SOOOO good! Fits for almost any occasion and great with sautéed string beans in garlic and sweet potatoes too. Whenever I make it and no matter how much make I never get any leftovers ;-) I am making it again this weekend for 60 people! I hope I get some leftovers this time :-)

This is delicious and idiot proof! Added root vegetables to the pan along with the pork. I will make this again.

Writing a review to emphasize how idiot-proof this is. I used all the broth in the marinade rather than reserving 1 cup until after it was reduced. It still came out delicious. This is the sort of recipe you can execute sucessfully while having a glass of wine with your company, easy yet impressive.

Very tasty. Make sure to sear in a cast iron pan works very well. Husband loved it.

This turned out perfect! Moist, tender and flavorful. Of course, I'm all about customizing, so my rating can't truly be based on the original recipe - We had to double everything due to the size of tenderloin we had, and as a result, had to make some substitutions to cover insufficient ingredient amounts. Used veg instead of chicken stock, swapped 1/2 of the soy for ponzu, used ketchup and went a little heavy on a very nice aged balsamic. I was a bit short on ginger, so I amped up the garlic and seasoned with an asian bbq mix that we got from a local spice shop, added a dash of regular S&P. The large volume of sauce took me longer to reduce, I did not add the last cup of stock. The tenderloin did not need the help, but it was a delicious extra to go over veggies.

Rating: 4
A wonderful--and very, very easy--recipe. We like to add some red bell pepper and snow peas to the cooked marinade just before it finishes and then cover it all with a healthy dose of toasted sesame seeds. Also: 12 minutes at 400, plus a few minutes on the board tented with foil, is more than enough time.

Rating: 4
made this last night and it was fantastic! I used ketchup and balsamic vinegar. I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for but no worries. Also, I cooked the marinade for a lot longer (I had the time) and I highly recommend it because it makes it almost syrupy. I did not add the extra chicken broth and did not miss it! my husband raved about it!

This is really good. However, it was not a gingery as I expected. I put my frozen tenderloing in the plastic bag along with the tenderloin at night. The next morning I shook it up. When I came home from work it was time to get started. I used the ketchup instead of the tomato paste. I used balsalmic vinegar instead of cider, I think the cider might be slightly better. I would make this for a get together as it is that easy.

I was very happy with this meal. The pork came out juicy and flavorful, and I can't think of anything I'd do to alter the recipe. I served it with cold sesame noodles and steamed vegetables. I've since used this same marinade on chicken thighs, and that was also quite good.

I wanted a simple, tasty recipe for pork tenderloin and I found it in this recipe. No, not a WOW dish as another wrote but incredibly tasty, moist, tender and a real pleaser. I served it with brown rice and peas and will definitely use the leftovers in a stir fry. I used two pork tenderloins in the marinate and it worked out just right.

Rating: 3
Tasty, Easy, but not a WOW dish. You can easily marinate this for a few days longer, I think I marinated for 4 days. I suspect extra time in the marinade will help if you overcook it/prefer a more well cooked roast. My meat thermometer did not beep at 155 (it went to 175) and I was worried the meat would be dry, but the meat was still very tender and moist. I used balsalmic vinegar and a 1 lb tenderloin. Although I strained and boiled down the marinade, the meat was tasty enough that it did not require any additional sauce.

This was good. I used thick pork chops, since that was what I had in the freezer and they worked out nicely. I sliced the leftover chops and mixed with a little of the sauce to make sandwiches the next day.

Used 2 tenderloins and the amount of marinade was just right. I cooked them for 13 minutes and rested for 10 and it was perfect for our family--those who like it more pink were happy and those who like it more well done were happy. The marinade was enough for a sauce and a bit left for leftovers. i served with roasted asparagus and leftover mashed potatoes but next time I think I would use rice. Definitely would make again.

Absolutely fantastic recipe. I made slight modifications...after marinading the pork tenderloin, I mixed up olive oil, chopped onion, fresh garlic, fresh rosemary and pepper and brushed on the pork tenderloin before putting it in the oven. I also added a slight amount of cornstarch to the marinade to thicken to a sauce. It was really good. I will definately made over and over!!

I made this marinade with the following modification. Omit chicken broth, grate the ginger but just squeeze the ginger juice into the marinade so you don't have ginger bits on the meat. I used white wine vinegar instead. As the meat was roasting in the oven, I heated the marinade, added white wine and soy sauce and basted it over the meat twice during the cooking process. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! Everyone loved it! We're going to make it again tomorrow for xmas.

I love pork but for some reason it ends up dry, tough. Can't figure out how to cook moist pork-chops-tenderlion etc. So instead of marinate the pork I mixed all the ingredients put it in a slow cooker, cooked it all day. Pulled it out, took some gravy and put it in a pan, thicken the gravy...Great, very tasty and MOIST. I slow cook everything even pork chops. I could use advice how to make it moist and tender.

I prepared this dish for my extended family over the weekend and it received rave reviews. I bought two 2.5 lb. tenderloins and quadrupled the recipe. As suggested by others, I marinated the meat overnight. The only other major deviations from the recipe were that I added 20 oz. of unsweetened cherry juice to the marinade and I did not add the chicken broth to the reduction sauce. I served the dish with an orzo pilaf and steamed pea pods. It almost an hour to reduce the sauce, so factor in the extra time if you are making a large batch. I will definitely make this dish again!

Pork tenderloin is one of my favourites. This recipe is very adaptable to pairing with various vegetable side dishes.

Wonderfully easy marinate with just the right flavors. I have made this 3 or 4 times and follow the ingredients. I BBQ on high for 10min or so on each side then turn the BBQ (gas grill) off and let sit with the cover on for 1hour. This is a perfectly tender tenderloin that is just as good if not better sliced cold. Great summertime recipe.

I had a 2 lb. pork loin, so I doubled everything, also, I was out of brown sugar, so I subbed 2 T white suger. Due to a change in plans, I ended up marinating it a full 24 hours. Sauce was super flavorful, wonderful blend of tastes, but I didn't add the additional broth at the end. Due to the larger size, I roasted for 25 min., and it took that long to reduce the sauce too, stirring frequently. Drippings from roasting pan were fantastic.

I do not see where all the accolades are coming from. Bland, Balnd, Bland. Tender - yes bu this is the tenderloin so it is to be expected. Sauce was pleasant but not memorable. Followed recipe exactly as written. Also, make sure to keep your eye on the sauce as it reduces. I had to make a new sauce as the first batch burned and ruined one of my pans.

This entire menu was a smashing success as xmas dinner I made for my family while vacationing in kauai. I made everything as-is, except did not brown the pork prior to putting in the oven (cooked about 10 min longer), and used purple yams instead of the sweet potatoes, which needed some extra juice to moisten. The colors were fabulous and the flavor combination of the bitter kale, sweet purple potatoes and savory pork was absolutely divine.

Wow! This was great. I actually just put a 2 1/2 lb. pork roast in the crockpot, whipped the sauce together in a bowl, poured it over the roast and let it cook on high for the day. It took all the work out and it was absolutely incredible! Served it with stir-fried rice and veggies.

This is a summer and winter favorite. In the summer time, we slice the tenderloin into 2x2 inch pieces, marinate and grill with a fresh assortment of summer vegetables. We serve it steamed wild rices and mushrooms. In the winter, we use the oven. Either way, it's a good combination of pleasing flavors! (to minimize the salt, we use salt-free broth, or combine low sodium broth and cut back on the soy sauce.)

This was great but needed a few changes. First, there is way too much liquid. I used the amount in the recipe with twice the pork and it was fine. Second, the pork needs another five or ten minutes, at least in my oven, to get to 155. Third, adding the stock after reducing the marinade would have made soup. I added a half cup of heavy cream, reduced it slightly, and it was perfect. Also, I didn't strain the marinade, I strained the sauce. Basically, it's great with a few minor changes.

3 words: OH MY GOD. I love this recipe because you can be so creative with the ingredients and preparation. I usually add more ginger, typically use dark maple syrup or dark brown sugar; have added oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce, onions. But every time it's a little differen than the last. Have marinated the pork for as little as 1 hr and for as long as 36 hrs. Have used thick boneless chops and strips for the wok. Have cooked on the grill, used in a wok, and followed the recipe. ALL styles of prep have WORKED brilliantly. I've even used this for beef and it worked (with a little more garlic). I like this served on a bad of steamed baby bok choy and toasted sesame seeds.

I think pork is fantastic, be it loin, tenderloin, chops, roast... And most of the ingredients in this recipe are all HIGH on my list of favorites (although even the SUGGESTION of ketchup defiling pork horrifies me). But if you sear and roast a tenderloin which has been marinating for three hours, it shouldn't NEED to be smothered in the reduction sauce to have flavor - which this, sadly, did. The marinade didn't really infuse the meat beyond the outermost layer. A much better recipe on this site (which I have made countless number of times and shared with MANY) is the "Roast Pork Loin with Garlic & Rosemary."

Even though I screwed up the marinade unbelievably....(added ALL the chicken broth AND the olive oil) this was still great. Very easy, made it after a long day at the beach, the sauce was amazing - took longer than 15 minutes but it wasn't a hassle. I used a 3lb tenderloin and I would have liked more sauce but that was my fault. Honestly, if you could screw up the marinade/recipe like I did and still love it, you gotta keep it in your rotation!!

Based on some of the previous comments, I eliminated the chicken broth, which reduced the amount of liquid to be reduced, and really doesn't add to the taste of the dish.

Delicious! We really enjoyed this, and it's easy to make. If you like ginger but don't love ginger, you can probably use about 1.5 tablespoons instead of the full 3T. We used all 3, and it was definitely very gingery. Also, I don't see a reason to reduce the sauce down to a meager 1/3 cup. Reduce it by about half, and add a bit of thickening agent to finish it off. Finally, I used an entire tenderloin (~ 2 lbs) and had plenty of marinade and sauce for it. Didn't leave behind too many left overs though! That's how much we liked it.

My family said this was a four-forker! I made it on the grill, which worked out great, and doubled the recipe, including the marinade.

I have made this twice now and have really enjoyed it both times.

Really enjoyed this dish. I marinated the tenderloin for 10-12 hours (next time I'll marinate overnight) and otherwise made the recipe as specified (choosing balsamic vinegar over cider vinegar). I wasn't crazy about the sauce. It was too sweet for me - best in small doses.

i just made this today and thought it was very yummy! i too let it marinade overnight and as i had no chicken stock i left it out. others said they didn't miss it and as far as marinade goes neither did i. but when i made the sauce it was too sweet on its own. maybe stock would've helped that. i'm not a big sauce fan anyway. i fixed brown rice and baby zucchini, lovely meal.

Absolutely amazing and delicous way to prepare pork tenderloing. This recipe will be made frequently at my home. The flavors were rich and intense. Excellent served over rice. The sauce is an absolute must in completing this dish. I'm not sure what is wrong with the few miscreants who did not like this. Perhaps they don't know how to cook or lack a palate for complex flavors. I'd give this more than 4 stars is I could.

What a hit!! Had time to marinate for 8 hours, next time I'll try for longer, I imagine the taste will only be better.

I liked the texture of the pork, but it didn't have much taste. I marinated it for 7 hours. If I were to do this again, I'd increase the seasonings, perhaps adding star anise and chilies. The sauce was a good consistency but again it was pretty bland.

This recipe was good, but there are better ones out there. Cooking Light's Korean Pork Tenderloin uses fewer ingredients (no broth, no ketchup, has sesame oil) and has a more concentrated flavor. I'd pick that one over this one.

This meal was well recieved both times I made it. The first time I made it my sister-in-law raved so much another friend asked me to make it for her.

A foolproof way to make pork. To the people who didn't like it, well, just look at the marinade ingredients. If you don't want a slightly Asian taste to the meal, then don't make this recipe.

I definitley would not make this recipe again. I made it for Easter dinnerfor 10.Yes pork tenderloin was moist but so are all the other ways I cook pork tenderloin and have much better taste than this recipe has. Single recipe of marinade is enough for about 2lbs. of meat. I hated the sauce and threw it out. I served Stonewall Kitchens Farmhouse Chutney and Onion Chutney instead and these 2 chutneys saved the meal! There are much better pork tenderloin recipes available. Don't be fooled by all the great reviews this one got.

Wonderful! I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it. The best compliment was my 15 year old son who declared it "restaurant quality" good. I got a laugh out of that!

Pork tenderloin is one of my favorite easy main dishes to make. This marimade was very tasty - ginger and garlic are hard to beat - will definitely make this again.

I thought I'd try this recipe since it's gotten so much praise. I followed the recipe exactly, but made 4 times the marinade since I was using 3 lbs of pork tenderloin. It would actually have been enough marinade if I only doubled it. There was so much marinade left that I put it in the freezer for next time. I didn't really enjoy the flavors too much either. There are other pork tenderloin recipes out there that are much better (like the one with maple glaze). And I thought cooking it to the specified tempoeratures made it a little more over cooked that I like. I'd make it again to use the marinade, but this recipe is not a keeper for me.

This was amazing!! I had to sub in orange juice for the vinager and didn't have ginger, so used a few drops of L&P. Only had time to marinade for 2 hours but it still turned out amazing. Loved the sauce will make more next time.

Big fan of pork tenderloin and this recipe is a keeper ! Served it with mashed garnet yams with thyme and butter, & broccoli that was stir fried in a wok with an orange sesame sauce. It's the marinade that made this recipe a stand out - pour it on ! With the pieces of tenderloin fanned out on each plate and colors of the yams and broccoli, the presentation was outstanding.

I've made this several times as written with great success. An overnight marinade is best. Reducing the marinade until thick makes a delicious sauce.

I absolutely loved this dish and so did my family. Very tender and has such great flavor. I will be making this many more times.

I made this for my husband's b-day dinner last month, and he just LOVED it--well, we both did--we almost ate the entire tenderloin in one sitting!! I admit that despite the rave reviews I was a bit wary about whether all the marinade ingredients would work well together, but they really really did! Definitely marinate overnight if you have time.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice. The first time (due to changing schedules) it marinated for 3 or 4 days and was extremely tasty and tender. The second time, due to last minute cooking I was only able to marinate for an hour or two. Definately marinate as long as you can.

This was great. I marinated overnight which not only made it taste delicious but really cut down the amount of work to be done that night. Makes it perfect for a mid-week meal. Served w/ steamed broccoli and creamy polenta. Yummy!!

Terrific recipe-great balance of flavors. I doubled the marinade except for the ginger and marinated for 9 hours. The reduced marinade is terrific. Will definitely serve again!

I marinated this overnight as well and then grilled-brushing it with the sauce. This time I did not strain or reduce the marinade and it was terrific. I have made it by the exact directions, which was great too. Really depends on your cooking method and amount of time you have.

Rating: 3
Simple and delicious. I didn't bother to add the extra chicken broth or strain the reduction sauce. Served with sweet potatoes and kale as suggested. This was great. Actually caught my husband drinking some of the leftover sauce while he cleaned the kitchen. Sort of scary considering the sauce's sodium content, but certainly evidence that it was good.

This recipe was terrific. I marinated overnight, and it was very tender and tasty. The ginger is just the right strength -- adds a nice flavor without being overpowering.

The marinade would work well with beef or chicken too. I diced red potatoes and roasted them right in the pan with the pork. Gave a nice flavor to the potatoes. Next time I'll add a little marinade into the roasting pan .

Rating: 3
Very easy and low fat, too! I would agree that the marinade reduction doesn't need a full cup of chicken broth added to create the sauce. I found that a 1/2 a cup was plenty. I enjoyed the stronger flavor.

Fabulous! My boyfriend loved this dish. And I was surprised by the tasty marinade and tender meat. I marinated only for a few hours and the flavors infused the meat nicely. Even if they hadn't, reducing the marinade made a wonderful sauce to serve with the pork (which was also very nice with rice I served with this dish). Highly recommend this if you have all of the ingredients on hand as it was quick and delicious!

Wow! I marinated the pork overnight. What a delicious, tender, outstanding recipe. Sadly, there were no leftovers!

This was very simple and delicious. The hint of sweetness the marinade left on the meat appealed to my picky ten-year old son (who wouldn't try a sauce on anything no matter what). I loved the ginger. Thanks, karen

Absolutely fabulous! As suggested by other reviewers, I marinated the pork overnight which made it incredibly flavorful and tender (I added a healthy handful of chopped cilantro to the marinade). I followed Panama City's advice and added the broth before boiling the marinade -- great suggestion! Next time I will only use 1/2 cup of broth, the full cup seemed way too much and despite adding it earlier in the recipe than called for the larger amount of broth seemed to dilute the lovely flavor. This recipe is delightful!

Rating: 3
I thought the tenderloin tasted good but I would marinate longer as has been suggested. As to the sauce, the taste was wonderful following the reduction but then I added the chicken broth which diluted that great flavor. In the future, I would add the extra chicken broth before reducing so i could monitor flavor and consistency or plan for a longer simmer time after adding the broth. My family loves pork tenderloin and this was a nice change from our usual recipe.

I used this recipe for the first time on Valentine's Day for a dinner I was preparing for two close friends. This recipe was so amazing that I had to give it a review. I doubled everything in the marinade, excluding the ginger, and the couple I was cooking for couldn't get enough of it! Just fantastic!

Wonderfull! I'd never cooked a pork tenderloin before (only eaten it) and this was so easy. Guests raved about it. I added chili oil for spice. To die for! I tripled the recipe and all that was left over was sauce...I'm trying to figure out what to use it on. Any suggestions?

Tasty and tangy--excellent over mashed potatoes. I would recommend letting the meat marinade for more than the recommended 2 hours--I did 6 hours, and it turned out just lovely!

Sorry, I thought this was a so-so recipe. My husband and child liked it though. I follwed the instructions, but enjoyed the rice more than the pork.

I have made this a couple of times and I let it marinate overnight. I did get distracted and not strain the sauce the first time and had to toss it since the ginger had too much bite. The next time the sauce was great. Very easy. I really wouldn't change it.

My first time submitting a comment but this recipe is WELL worth it. My boyfriend and I have made this several times for diferent people, and each time it gets RAVE reviews. I would not change any of the ingredients. The only adjustments I would suggest you make are 1) marinade it overnight for more flavor and 2) no real need to wait an hour before cooking it. Wonderful dish!

Succulent, tender, and richly flavored--and very easy to prepare. A huge hit with my husband. Definitely let marinate over night to deepen the flavor. Will most certainly make again--this one's a keeper!

Made this for guests and they nearly died over it--had to make extra rice so everyone could sop up the sauce. Threw it on the barbecue instead of in the oven, and that added a smokiness to the already delicious flavors.

This is an absolutely fabulous dish! I made the pork for the Fried Rice with Pork and Kale. I used boneless pork loin chops and I ended up marinating them for an entire day and part of the next. I did sear them and then put in the oven for about 15 minutes, then took them out and tented them as described. They smelled so good and were so juicy, I had to try them while I was slicing them up. The best ginger pork I've ever tasted! I didn't get to use the marinade to make the sauce, but this is something I'll definitely be doing again all by itself. Simple and delicious enough for company!

Great recipe! Simple to prepare and wonderful flavor. I didn't have time to marinate it as long as suggested but it was still flavorful and moist. I did not brown the meat and roasted it on convection. I followed others suggestion and added the chicken broth before reducing the sauce.

It is very delicious and simple to make. I might try to use fruit syrup instead of brown suger next time and reduce the amount of ginger to 2 spoons instead of 3. Best pork recipe I have ever made.

This pork was OUTSTANDING! I accidentally left in the oven too long and thought for sure it would be tough and dry. Not a chance! Its so moist and tender, you can cut with a fork! And wow the flavors! I will make this again and wouldn't hesitate to serve it to guests!

Rating: 4
This is probably the best pork loin/ginger recipe Ive done! Easy and quick, all the ingredients blend deliciously. I prefer the tomato paste in taste (and also not so junky as ketchup). The ginger is well present in flavour without being too dominant. I would definitely brown to sear. Also followed recommendation of adding broth at beginning of reduction and completely agree that it renders the sauce more substance- delish! Will continue to make---Enjoy!

My partner loved this one. Said was one of the best I ever made for him. One note of caution, I mistakenly added all the broth to the marinade. I was able to save the sauce be straining the madinade and the recuding it all, just started it sooner that recommended.

This is delicious. A friend made it for me a few weeks ago, and I made it for company yesterday. Everyone raved. The pork was SOOOO tender! And the kitchen smelled so good. Surely this will be made again, and again, and again.....

Pretty tasty. No need to brown. Just put in 350 oven for about 30 minutes until internal temperature is 145 degrees. Added the extra cup of broth at the beginning of the reduction after straining. Makes better sense than at the end. Mixed some cornstarch with some broth to thicken.

My family and I really enjoyed this. Sauce was wonderful. Plan to make it as one of the entrees for Christmas dinner. If making for a large group, was wondering if either 1) the meat can be seared a few hours in advance, or 2) the searing step could be omitted somehow, just using the oven, without the meat being too dry. I prefer to do as much as possible in advance to avoid a messy kitchen when my guests arrive. Any suggestions?

Outstanding! I reserved the addiional broth but added to the marinade at the beginning of reducing the sauce. We cooked up a 1.25# tenderloin and it was indeed ample sauce. The 155 temp is perfect for this piece of meat.

Very easy and tasty. I didn't strain the sauce - we love garlic and ginger - and it was fine. I used this marinade with 2 tenderloins, and it was sufficient. There was ample sauce for everyone and leftovers (a delicious lunch!)

Flavorful, moist and easy! I accidentally poured all of the chicken broth into the marinade instead of reserving some as the recipe instructs. But the pork and sauce still came out wonderful. I love the ginger and the balance of flavors that come from the soy sauce, sugar and ketchup. It's a nice change from the usual garlic and rosemary seasonings that I often use with pork tenderloin.

Rating: 4
Followed the recipe exactly, except that I marinated the tenderloin for about six hours. Truly exceptional. When straining the sauce, be sure to press the residue to squeeze through all of that great ginger juice. This is a company quality dish.
