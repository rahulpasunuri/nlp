This was a tasty recipe although fairly indulgent. I used 1% milk instead of the heavy cream and cheddar cheese instead of Comte. I skipped the cheese between layers, added a few ounces of chopped sautéed prosciutto and used canned San Marzano tomatoes. Used half cauliflower and half broccoli, and didn't bother to sautee them. Also just sprinkled the top with panko and Parmesan - I thought the recipe had enough fat in it without adding more - then broiled for a few moments after baking to get a nice crust. It was still very rich and comforting. Not something I would make every week but I'll keep it in mind for next time a serious cheese craving hits.

I have been making this recipe for years with a few changes (I reduce the cream to 1/4 C) and it is a favorite for my three kids.

Yum! This was a home run. It's a little hot here for mac'n'cheese, but I had a beautiful heirloom cauliflower (who knew there were heirloom cauliflowers?) and garden tomatoes that needed using, so it was meant to be. Modifications: Used all gruyere cheese, substituted whole-milk Greek yogurt for creme fraiche, thinned out heavy cream with 1/4 cup 2% milk, used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs, and forgot the mustard. Oh, and I also augmented the vegetables with 4-5 large shallots. Everyone loved it, even the kids, who are not normally big cauliflower fans. Leftovers were devoured for next day's lunch. Time and heat-saving tip: Because my kitchen was sweltering, instead of saving the pasta for last last, I cooked it right after the tomatoes and left it in the colander (placed inside the empty pot) while I sauteed the vegies and made the bechamel. Any stuck-together pieces loosened right up as soon as I mixed in the vegetables and sauce, and I didn't have to have that pot of hot water in my kitchen for an extra half hour.

This was DELICIOUS, and just as good the next day as leftovers! I used natural sour cream instead of creme fraiche, and 3 cups of Gruyere (because that's what I could come up with at my local grocery store).

YUM!!!! Although sicne cauliflower is a mild flavour I would try maybe broccoli next time. But either way it was so yummy!

The sauce on this is outstanding. The dish takes a few steps and a few pans but well worth the effort. I think next time I would leave out the cauliflower and substitute more pasta - for me it didn't add anything. It's really all about the flavors of the cheese sauce and the crunchy breadcrumbs on top (I used a little extra) - a great twist on macaroni and cheese!

I made a half recipe of this, and followed it exactly with the exception of roasting the cauliflower (and some garlic cloves too). It came out deliciously creamy, with a nice subtle tang from the creme fraiche and the mustard. I'll definitely make this one again, but I'll try it with regular sour cream instead simply for price reasons.

Rating: 4
Yum! Just made this for dinner and it is delicious! I made it with fusilli, 2 cups of gruyere, and 1 cup of parm plus added 1 head of roasted garlic. Oh, and I roasted the cauliflower instead of blanching. So good! And enough to feed an army.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent, extremely forgiving recipe. I lightened it slightly (and made it a little less expensive) by using regular plain yogurt for the creme fraiche and whipping cream for the heavy cream... I would go further in the future and just use milk. The cheese and butter add plenty of richness. I used canned tomatoes (seasonal choice, and why waste heirloom tomatoes here? Save them for where they will shine.) and fontinella cheese. We got 7 very generous serving out of it, with sauteed fresh green beans on the side. With the lightening, this could be a great casual dinner party meal, and keep it full-fat for special occasions.

I made this the other night in order to use up some creme fraiche and it was very good. I used gruyere cheese and a little sharp cheddar since I couldn't find the others, and I processed a french sour dough loaf to make my breadcrumbs, which were perfect. The cauliflower really adds something special to this dish - and the vegetable helps cancel out all the dairy. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
Excellent combination of flavors. Follow the recipe as is, the proportions are right. Definately use the tomato. On 3/28/11 I made this w/Dubliner cheese & good parm instead of the Comte, greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche, garlic instead of green onions (and a shake of dried onion) and gnocchi instead of penne and it was great. I skipped the breadcrumbs but they would have made it even better. This would be nice made in individual caserole dishes - would easily get 4 -6 individual servings out of this recipe. Definately let it sit after you take it out of the oven. Serve with a simple green salad with tomatoes, simply dressed with lemon juice & olive oil.

After reading the recipe, it sounded so good, so I gave it a try. However, I had several issues with this recipe. First, while making it, I realized it has more than enough fat and calories to give you a heart attack. Second, while making the cheese sauce, it started to turn rubbery and stiff, and I really started to worry. Third, it tasted fine, but was lacking in flavor. It probably could've used some more herbs and/or spices, and personally, less of the creme fraiche. Finally, it required expensive ingredients, and in my opinion, not worth the cost for making something as bland as it turned out to be.

Rating: 4
The butter, whipping cream and cheese sort of defeat the cauliflower and the whole wheat penne that we used, but this was a great treat. I think a sharper cheese would be an excellent sub, but this was yummy as is.

I made this with cheddar because I didn't plan ahead well enough to find a store that had the two suggested cheeses. It was great and everyone loved it! I will make it again, and it seems like a good basic recipe for experimenting with variations.

This is a great mac and cheese. I used canned tomatoes, gryere and swiss,added a little crushed pepper,topped with a mix of panko and ritz, and slivered comte. I also added fontina and spinach chicken sausage from TJ's. The cauliflower made the dish moist and and not as rich. Yum.

I don't tupically review a recipe unless I love it and this recipe is now one of our favorites. I did a few things different, used half swiss and half cheddar to get rid of what I had in the fridge, one tomato instead of two and panko breadcrumbs instead of fresh. I would not change a thing, this recipe if perfect. And the cauliflower is such a nice touch. I highly recommend you try this. Delish!

My husband made this last night with the addition of some hot Italian sausage and it turned out beautifully! This could definitely be served to guests on a cold winter's night. The only complaint is that it's pretty labor intensive for a pasta bake, but in the end is worth the effort.

I must update my 3/28/10 review because last night I browned 1/2 pound of hot Italian sausage (casings removed) and turned this into a meat eaters dish with rave reviews. It proves just how versatile this casserole can be.

Decent enough, but is it worth all the effort? Bland despite the fantastic Comte.

Made it pretty much as listed (other than changing the cheese to a mix of Gruyere and Dubliner) as I was looking to find a use for some creme fraiche I had in the fridge. Didn't like it at all--it tasted like a corinary in thr making without any of the fun usually associated with that. Too bland, too much suace.

Absolutely delicious! Being winter, I couldn't find heirloom tomatoes, so I went with a 14oz can of diced tomatoes. I also used half gruyere and half fontina. All else as directed. The fresh breadcrumbs are a MUST! Loved this and will make it over and over again!

Rating: 4
Wonderful mac&cheese recipe, but it takes far longer than you would expect. We replace creme fraiche with sour cream and mix and match the other cheeses with whatever is on hand. It's worth the effort, but don't enter into this recipe lightly!

Rating: 3
Made this essentially as written but used a drained can of diced tomatoes in place of the heirlooms and substituted milk for the cream. Had comte so used that. I think I would make more of the sauce next time, my pasta seemed to really absorb a lot of it. Although it didn't come out tasting how I had expected, it was good and we will have it again. The comte actually melded well with the cauliflower.

Rating: 4
This is a great dish as written. OK, so it's not exactly a low fat meal. But it is taaa-sty. I made it exactly as written, except for using the alternate gruyere/fontina mix, and it was delightful. I suppose you could fire it up a bit with cayenne or some other spices, but it's quite nice - and very kid friendly - as written. If you insist on being a carnivore, probably the best thing to go with this would be cut up boneless chicken breasts, grilled and then thrown in the mix.

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this recipe! The only changes I made were using the gruyere/fontina cheese instead of comte(couldn't find it). And I replaced the heavy cream with fat free milk, and used just 3/4 c. of cream fraiche. It was so good! My husband is a fussy eater and hates veggies, but he loved them in this dish.

Rating: 3
Delicious, although I made it a lot healthier by cutting down on the cream and cheese. (As stated it's got to be worse for you than a big mac.) I used milk to make the sauce, and only about 1/2 c. grated Cheddar (it's what I had) and 1/2 c Parmesan. I also dumped in a blob of cream cheese that I was trying to use up, and omitted the creme fraiche. I used regular onion instead of green. I was completely tasty and filling as a vegetarian main course, and didn't taste like a heart attack.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe several times, always to very positive reviews. Each time I have altered the original.... steadily getting more healthful. In case someone's interested, I use twice the amount of tomatoes, add about 14 chopped Kalamata olives, use non-fat milk and non-fat Greek yoghurt instead of cream and creme fraiche and finally top the lot off with food processor (whole grain) breadcrumbs with some pecorino cheese added and no additional oil. The cauliflower can also be browned in olive oil with little or no diminution of the flavour. Also, a good dash of cayenne pepper is not a bad addition. The nutritional improvements of this version are astounding and the taste is very good.

Although I left the tomatoes and green onions out of this recipe (I have fussy eater-I made a salad instead) this is by far the best recipe for Cauliflower I have ever made.

I really liked this! The tomatoes keep it from being too heavy. I had a few tweaks - I used a combo of fontina and gruyere cheese instead of the Comte called for (I couldn't find Comte). I also used a 1/2 can of crushed tomatoes (my local megamart didn't have heirloom and I already had these on hand). I didn't have bread on hand and used some canned breadcrumbs I needed to use up. I also added some fresh thyme to the cream sauce (just because I love fresh thyme). I also made a few modifications with the pans. This uses a lot of pans! I browned the cauliflower mixture in a skillet, and then rinsed the skillet and used it for the cream sauce. I did have to brown the bread crumbs in a different pan. I didn't layer the sauce and cheese, I just mixed all of the fontina/ gruyere into the sauce and tossed it with the pasta, then put the parm/ breadcrumb mixture on top. Overall this used a LOT of dishes. It's not a quick and easy sort of weeknight meal, really (which is OK. It's delicious!). I really liked the addition of tomatoes here. I wasn't sure the penne and cauliflower would work but it really did. Best of all, it makes a good size amount so I had plenty of leftovers and it still tasted really good! Definitely a new go-to meal for me.

Love, love love this recipe. Have made it three times and everyone adores it. Used a 14 os can chopped tomatoes to save time and worked fine. Also used combo of whole milk and half and half instead of all cream, but it is better as written... (You cannot use 2% milk and greek yogurt and expect this to be any good. Have a bowl of Special K and save yourself both the fat and the trouble) and call it a day)

What a tasty recipe...I didn't rate since I changed it a bit. I used 3 cups guyere, 1% milk in place of creme fraiche, and panko instead of fesh bread crumbs. I also added a few dashes of cayenne to bring out the creaminess. A lot of the reviews said that it was a heavy dish, but I didn't think so at all. The cauliflower makes the dish quite light and adds a nice bit of texture. I thought it tasted better in 1/2 inch cubes instead of 1 inch cubes. Next time, I think I'll use around 2.25 lbs of cauliflower. Also, I think it would taste great with some bites of salmon.

This is, in the current slang, crazy good. I had it at a dinner party; the hostess followed the recipe exactly except that she used a fontina/gruyere mix, since comte wasn't available to her. The results are astounding. When I got the recipe, I was a bit taken back by the fat content, but seriously, this is one of those recipes that you wouldn't make everyday, but what an indulgence! So follow the recipe and you'll understand why those who did love, love, love this dish. It really is the best mac & cheese dish I've ever had.

Rating: 4
This was awesome - i halved the recipe (there are only two of us). I used 1/2 fontina 1/2 gruyere - I think if you like gruyere, you should go with that combination - comte is a little less bold in flavor. Also, I used 2 vine ripened tomatoes (instead of 1 heirloom) - i don't think it makes that much of a difference - add a little sugar to the mix if they are slightly under-ripe. Granted, it does take 3 pans, but it is soooo good.

i made this with 2% milk and nonfat greek yogurt instead of whipping cream and creme fraiche. still it was way too rich and creamy yet somehow still lacking in flavor. the tomatoes do nothing but add color. i feel like it was a waste of $20 worth of great fontina and gruyere!

Yum! Followed others' advice and skipped sauteeing the cauliflower in butter; also used panko breadcrumbs, where were great. Skipped the heavy cream - 3/4 cup of whole milk and 1/4 cup of 2% milk was plenty rich. Just a fabulous dish.

Very good variation on traditional mac n cheese. Made this for company and even the kids devoured it! My local market didn't have creme fraiche so I subbed 1/2 c half and half and about 1/2 c vanilla yogurt for a bit of tang. It did make a sinkful of dishes, but worth it for a crowd pleasing dish.

This was amazing! It is great on it's own and also as a side for salmon. I cut the cauliflower a little smaller - into bit sized pieces. Also I was short on the cream and used about 2/3 C whole milk instead. Plenty rich and delicious!!! I have been loving the left overs too!

I'm usually skeptical of homemade mac & cheese type dishes, but this one was delicious. To cut down on the fat I used skim milk instead of cream and low-fat plain yogurt instead of the creme fraiche. It's probably richer with the full-fat ingredients, but I thought it was quite tasty this way as well.

Rating: 4
I made this for a small dinner party and everyone thought it delicious. They especially liked the addition of the caulifIower. I used whole wheat penne and a little more of the comte cheese simply to use the small amount left after grating the 3 cups. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Yes, it's rich, but once in a while for special occasions why not. I may try whole milk next time just to cut down on the fat calories.

This was a delicious variation on the humble mac 'n' chesse...comfort food on a rainy day! Loved the addition of cauliflower. I subbed whole milk for the whipping cream with no loss of flavour or creamy richness. Also used 20 cherry tomatoes cut into quarters...wouldn't do that again as the skins separated and were a bit unpleasant. As others, I used a combo of gruyere and fontina, as well as panko crumbs...love their crunch. A sinkful of dirty dishes to wash, but well worth the effort.

I made this as a side dish with Thanksgiving dinner, changing only a few things from the original recipe (used whole milk in place of heavy cream; used regular vine tomatoes instead of heirloom; upped the cheeses and green onions a bit). It was very tasty, and got good reviews from my fellow guests. I'll make it again, but likely with some changes. I didn't think the tomatoes added much to the dish, and would probably leave them out next time (or use diced cherry tomatoes for their extra "zing"). I wasn't familiar with Comte -- found it at Trader Joe's -- and while it was nice, I thought it was almost too subtle, like a very mild Swiss. Per suggestions by previous reviewers, I would like either a bolder cheese, such as Dubliner, OR would consider adding something to punch the dish up, such as crab meat.

Rating: 4
I will definitely make this again. It is a bit rich, so I'll try it with some skimmed milk next time and cut back on the butter. The only deviation I made from the recipe was to use spelt penne--the nutty flavour worked nicely with the cheeses and the browned cauliflower. I wouldn't skip browning the cauliflower. The browning deepens the flavour profile. It tastes like a "special occasion" dish, which is nice for vegetarians

Rating: 0
I liked this and will make it again. Like another reviewer I made modifications so I won't rate it. I used gruyere and Parmiggiano and stirred all of the cheese into the mornay instead of saving some to layer. I omitted the tomato as its November and I don't have one and used a minced garlic clove for the green onions. I also stirred in a tablespoon or so of fresh lemon juice with the cauliflower. Panko and more Parmiggiano stood in for the bread crumbs. Good use for all of the cauliflower from the farm share. I'm also going to try Cauliflower and Caramelized Onion Tart. fineeats.blogspot.com

I ma making this for the second time tonight- my kids loved it. Very rich of course, all you have to do is read the ingredients to figure that out, if you want something low fat look for a different recipe. I think browning the cauliflower added a nutty touch and will not skip that step although many people said it didn;t matter. Also, if you substitute cheddar for gruyere or comte you will end up with a completely different tasting dish, which may be why some people didn;t like it?

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party and it was a great hit. I used 1% milk rather than cream to cut down on the fat content and don't think it affected the taste at all. I also used tomatoes from my garden (had a few left). One of the guests is on the South Beach diet so I used whole grain pasta in an effort to make it diet friendly for her. To my surprise she ate two servings and said it was worth every calorie. A friend owns a cheese shop so I used the comte cheese as she said it would make a difference in the taste. We all thought it was excellent and I will make it again.

This is good. I'm not going to rate the original recipe since I deviated quite far from it. I tried to amp it up by leaving out the mustard and adding 2 crumbled, browned links of spicy Italian sausage. I regretted it because the sausage didn't go well with the other flavors in the dish. After tasting it, I had the idea of adding some lump crab meat next time and maybe even some small shrimp as well. I think that would be amazing. In the interests of not dying of heart disease, I only used about half the butter called for in the recipe and also half heavy cream with half skim milk. The sauce was still thick, rich and creamy. I added some ground cayenne and red pepper flakes because we like our food spicy.

Like other cooks, I thought this recipe was really delicious. The downside (reason why I didn't give it 4 forks) is that it was INSANELY fattening. I should have done what many others have done and used skim milk instead of heavy cream. Like others, I combined Gruyere and Fontina because Whole Foods didn't have Comte. I will likely make this recipe again but try reducing the fat content! Also, I served this dish with a simple Dijon salad, with toasted walnuts and gorgonzola -- mmm!

This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party. Like others I used fontina (danish) and gruyere. I also substituted skim milk for the cream at the recommendation of another reviewer, and it worked perfectly. Oh, and I used 3 large vine ripened tomatoes b/c that was what I had on hand, and reduced the butter at each step with no noticeable downside. I will definitely make this one again!

We enjoyed this recipe. It is very rich so definitely serve it with a salad and cut the portion down a bit. I used Mexican crema in place of the creme fraiche, similar in creaminess and mild. Also took the suggestions of others and used a combination of gruyere and fontina as I couldn't find comte. I thought it could have used a bit more tomato. I used regular vine ripened tomatoes instead of heirloom. I will definitely keep this recipe, quite tasty.

Rating: 0
Followed the recipe almost exactly, with the following exceptions: skipped the browning of the cauliflower, used low fat creme fraiche, and a mixture of double gloucester and farmhouse cheddar instead of the comte. Definitely wasn't good enough to justify this many calories. I expected much more after reading others' reviews. Still, husband and kids ate it but no one particularly impressed. Said they would have much preferred our traditional Cauliflower Cheese.

I did use the compte cheese it is available at costco. I would skip the browning of the cauliflower. Aggree herloom tomato is a waste. Maybe grape or cherry tomato would add color. The Creme fraiche I bought was expensive. I noticed you can sub buttermilk and heavy cream mixed up 50/50. Will try that next time.

I'm reviewing again after making this a second time. I used creme fraiche this time, rather than sour cream - DO THAT! The sour cream was good and what I had on hand, but it was extra creamy and rich with creme fraiche. This time I used vine tomatoes instead of heirloom - which was fine. I also increased the tomato and green onion, which I recommend. This is a delicious recipe, best served with a light salad. What a treat (again).

I followed other reviewers and used sour cream and a variety of cheeses (half Fontina/half Gruyer). Next time I'd like to use the Irish Dubliner though to give it kick. Instead of the whipping cream, I used organic skim milk (not watery) and that turned out really well. I didn't have time to get the heirlooms so I used Italian romas. I'll try them next time. Everyone loved it, even the kids. I will definitely make this again!

I usually love Mac and Cheese but this particular recipe just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was too rich and not enough cheesey flavour - I did like the veggie part of it though. I found the Compte cheese to be very expensive as well as the heirloom tomatoes (I personally think that any tomato would have done) Using the creme fraiche and the whipping cream and the 5 tablespoons of butter made it WAY too rich (for my liking) I also found it to be a whole bunch of fussing and used just about every pot that we had. The bread topping was wonderful and will definitely use that again. I'll wait until we finish the leftovers (which for 3 people there is lots left) before I decide if I'll make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I don't think Heirloom tomatoes made any real difference - I will buy the cheaper Hothouse tomatoes next time. I think that broccoli could work in this in place of cauliflower. The cheese is interchangeable, too. I'll try Swiss or a cheddar next time I make this.

Fantastic; and I didn't find it to be the big pain to make that others did, just a lot of pans/pots to clean. I used sour cream and the gruyere/fontina as Whole Foods was out of creme fraiche and Comte. It turned out great. Next time I'll add one additional tomato. After the boiling/peeling/seeding there's not a lot left. Be sure to serve it with a salad with some sort of vinaigrette to balance the richness. This is crazy good. Even my non cauliflower eating husband had seconds.

I absolutely loved this dish (of course cauliflower is one of my favorite vegetables). I did find Comte cheese, which was very tasty, and used a fresh yellow heirloom tomato.

Made this recipe after looking at the delicious looking photo in the Bon Appetit. It was a big success. An excellent blend of flavors. Very rich (not lowfat at all). We had it for dinner and will have plenty for leftovers for at least another dinner and a lunch as well. Very tasty. Lots of steps--none of them particularly tricky. Followed the recipe exactly (using the half gruyere and half fontina as I couldn't find any comte in the local market). Highly recommend if you are looking for a comfort food type dinner--would also make a lovely casserole for taking to a potluck or if you need to take a meal to a someone.
