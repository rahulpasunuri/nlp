Nice taste and moist. I added almond extract and soaked the cherries in kirsch to add some more flavor. Even with a 10 inch pan, after 30 min, the cake was only half-cooked.

Gorgeous!! Used regular flour and it came out so light and delicate, not too sweet. Really beautiful! Will be keeping this one and making again!!

Just made this recipe and had to use an unusual cooking method. After I mixed the batter and loaded it into the pan, I noticed that the power to my oven was off, so I decided to put the whole thing into the lidded gas barbeque outside! It has a thermostat, so I just kept the temp at 350 and hoped for the best (took about an hour). It actually worked and though I haven't cut into it yet, it looks fine. Here's to creativity!

Using a 9" vs. a 10" pan does make a big difference in baking time. Mine took alot longer. I thought the texture and taste were wonderful, but I would only use SOUR cherries. I can't imagine using sweet ones for this. Sour have so much more flavor and seem more appropriate for this style of recipe

Really enjoyed this cake. I baked it a little longer than I should have so it wasn't AS moist as it should be but still was enjoyed by everyone. Next time I may do a powdersugar glaze.

I think I baked this for over an hour when all was said and done -- I used a 9 inch springform pan rather than 10 inch but can't imagine it made that much difference. The outside of the cake was actually the best part -- nice golden and krispy but otherwise, mine turned out kind of like corn bread texture. I used Oregon Brand Cherries and they had a really nice taste. So, I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I'll look for some other alternative recipes. I threw this one away.

I made it last night for dessert and got rave reviews so, I'm making it again this morning to for a coffee. My baking time took 35+ mins too. I also think that may have been the problem with it sticking to the bundt pan as described below. Hint instead of butter & flour I always prep my cake pans with PAM & plain bread crumbs(tap out excess)works great!

One of the most tender, moist cakes I've ever made. So easy to put together and so good. Did any else have a problem with the baking time? At 30 mins, my cake was still wobbly and uncooked in the middle. I took it out after a good 35 minutes and when I cut it, the centre was still a little underdone. Probably my oven, as no-one else has commented. I agree that the cherries didn't add much in the way of flavour. I shall try another brand next time. Overall, a delicate, delicious and very easy cake which will join my list of favourites.

Lovely. Really nice and moist. I agree that the cherries don't really add a lot of flavor, and will try the brandy idea next time, but I did really like this. My boyfriend said "this is a really special cake."

The texture of this cake is FABulous! I've been rather dissappointed with a lot of the cakes I've made recently; even when they are flavorful, something just seems too dense or too dry. Not this time! I agree it's probably the cherries that keep it so moist. Based on the suggestion of another reviewer, I soaked the cherries in blackberry vodka before adding to the batter. I don't know if it helped, but it certainly didn't hurt. I also forgot to buy a lemon, so just used a teaspoon of lemon juice instead, and I did use cake flour. And since I made this cake for Easter dessert, I decided to frost it with a light pink frosting, and decorate with pink-tinted coconut. I probably wouldn't repeat the coconut, although it was the perfect accent on the Easter table, but this cake manages icing very well. I didn't want to splurge $8 for one vanilla bean, so the frosting was a fun and tasty alternative.

Have made this twice and plan to make it again next week. The taste is wonderfully lemony with a hint of vanilla and the texture of the cake reminds me of ones made with cake flour -- that's how light and delicate this cake is. It was also incredibly easy to make. The only thing that kept this recipe from being a four-forker was the canned cherries. They contributed nothing to the flavor; they were just moist, red lumps in the cake(though I'll bet they helped keep the cake moist). Maybe it's the brand I bought; I don't know. Next time, I'm going to try soaking them in some brandy just to give them a little flavor.

Great easy cake to make for a rainy day or unexpected guests. Everyone said they loved it and they must have - it was gone in 2 days. Just make sure to drain cherries very well.
