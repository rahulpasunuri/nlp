4 forks isn't enough to do justice to this salad. My husband isn't much of a salad eater but he craves this. Use the freshest organic ingredients available to showcase the flavors. We added organic baby arugula and it just rocks!

Excellent flavor and easy to make. I now make the steak without the salad and it's a hit every time.

The salad was a hit with my family. I used a thick New York strip steak and grilled instead of pan frying. Sauteed the peppers and onions in a bit of the dressing and substituted feta for the blue cheese. Paired with a good Oregon Pale Ale and it was a perfect light meal.

The steak was excellent & I will make again, exactly as given. The salad didn't do anything for us.

What a great recipe! So easy, even for a novice like me - turned out great - Tip for cooking the steak: blacken in the pan for 2-5 minutes each side (depending on thickness), the put in the oven for 6 minutes or so at 160C, instead of just relying on pan cooking. This will keep you from overcooking the outside of the steak. I will definitely make this one again.

Amazing flavours and very filling!! Didn't change too much except to add a few ingredients to the salad to "fatten it up". Boiled fingerling potatoes and then pan-fried in garlic and butter along with cremini mushrooms. Roasted chopped pecans in oven. Used filet mignons (frozen and wrapped in bacon) and fried the bacon separately and tossed into salad along with potatoes, mushrooms and pecans. Made for a very filling salad indeed! Dinner guests loved all, although I'd cut down slightly on cayenne next time as some guests found it a little hot for their liking.

Very good! I also cooked the steak inside in a skillet & set off the smoke alarm- but it was worth it!

Rating: 3
Prepared using left over filet, cooked rare. Simply flash fried in skillet to take the chill off, then sliced as directed. Fantastic - don't think the dressing was too much at all. Added left over roasted peppers in addition to raw sweet peppers. The roasted peppers provided colour and flavour. Will try the roastd pine nuts next time, would also add fried mushrooms. A big satisfying salad!

Rating: 4
This has become my signature dish. Ive made it close to fifty times and it is a hit every time. The only advice that I can add is to cook the meat on the grill. The first time I made the dish, I cooked the meat on the stove and set off every smoke alarm in the house. Cooking meat generates a LOT of smoke. If you are looking to impress your family or guests, make this recipe!!!

This recipe is extremely flavorful, yet a quick meal to make. I added pine nuts to give a texture contrast (my wife's idea!). I have used sirlion twice, just searing it on the outside. The blackening spices lock in all of the juices. The rarer the better, almost like carpaccio! I highly recommend this recipe.

Fabulous. The rub is wonderful and the dressing is perfect. I brushed a bit of the dressing on some portobello mushrooms and sprinkled with some of the rub. Grilled them along with the steak and sliced onto the salad. Added cucumber and extra bleu cheese. I will be making this again!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I used ribeye instead of tenderloin, and almost halved the oil in the dressing, but otherwise made it exactly as directed. The blue cheese I used was from Artisinal here in NYC ($19/lb.). It was delicious, but its complexity was a bit lost in all the flavors, so next time I'll go with something cheaper. This dish was outstanding and my guests said that I outdid myself. I served it with a scoop of horseradish potato salad (recipe on this site).

Oh my gosh this is a terrific recipe. Couldn't stop licking my fingers while slicing the steak. Just enough heat not too spicy. I put several other items in salad in a clean out frig day, ie bacon bits, heart of palms, avocado. Wow what a meal. Made for several friends and received rave reviews. A definite do over.

After tongiht, this recipe will forever be in my family. I have a 10 years old son that used to hum when he was a baby when he ate something he really liked. He stopped humming when he was around 2 years old. When we sat down to eat tonight he started humming again. It wasn't as loud or consistent, but he was doing it without knowing it. It was a really sweet moment. At one point he told me, "Mom, this is sooooo good." We can't keep them babies forever so I felt a little joy to watch him eat tonight. But that doesn't tell you about the meal. I used filet mignon (perhaps another reason he was humming) and a light balsamic dressing instead of making the one mentioned. The spices go great with the cool salad, tomatoes, cheese, etc. Has a bit of a bite, but not outrageous, especially since I can't handle really spicy food. I also added avocados. It is a really easy dish to prepare. This chef usually can only handle boxed mac and cheese. I will for sure make this again and again but probably with cheaper cuts of meat. With all the spices and the dipping in butter, of course it will stay tasty.

This is a summer favorite. I've made it many, many times for the two of us, and for guests by doubling the recipe. I've saved the leftover spice mixture and used it in other blackening dishes. This recipe always impresses.

I made this last night and really could not figure out what all the hoopla was about. While I was putting this together I realized it is nothing more than a steak and salad. I used some great Stilton, grill some baby asparagus but thought I won't make this again.

Last night was the 2nd time I've made this & it came out the best - for 2 people I bought 1 pkg of Trader Joe's Angus Beef tenderloin the kind with 2 filets for just under $10. Used the exact seasoning mix but brushed the filets with EVOO infused with chopped garlic all over before dipping in the spice mix. Bought Trader Joes mini-bell peppers & cut in half longways & brushed with the same oil. I bought 10 small red-skinned potatoes (about 1-inch diameter) & boiled for 5 min. & put 5 each on a wooden skewer that I trimmed so the wood stuck out only a little way & brushed with the same garlic oil. Per previous suggestions, I trimmed bottoms off pencil-thin asparagus & put into plastic bag & drizzled sesame oil in & speread the oil all over the asparagus. Used raw red onion for salad & fanned out one half avacado per person and sprinkled very tiny organic tomatoes over the salad. I gas-barbequed the steak, mini-pepper halves (barely 2 min. on Direct High), potatoes on skewers (turn often) and ultimately the asparagus , which got this amazing smokey flavor from the smoke from the steaks mixed with the sesame oil. Wow! Grilled some thin slices of Chibatta bread also brushed with, you guessed it, that olive/garlic oil and sprinkled in the grill with Parmesan cheese to melt on top. The presentation of the center salad mound topped and mixed in with the colorful pepper halves, tiny tomatoes, small skewer of red potatoes around the outside, and then the salad topped with fanned steak and fanned sliced avacado behind it was awesome. Looked like a restaurant salad & not all that much work - took about a half hour prep & then grill time. Boyfriend cleaned plate & smiled large.

Very tasty, easy and attractive. I cook for some picky eaters and even they LOVED it. Served it with garlic bread, and it made a perfect summer dinner.

This is so good! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added sauteed mushrooms, pecans toasted in the steak spice, and red peppers (makes the salad a little prettier). Because my husband and I love blue cheese, I mixed a small amount throughout the salad and then sprinkled some on top of the steak too. This gave you a little cheese in each bite. Though the steak rub has a little kick, I did not think this was too spicy at all. Just very flavorful! Also, turned on the vent fan as soon as I put on the steaks and I did not have any problems with the kitchen getting too smokey (as others complained). This was a really easy and really tasty dinner! My husband and I LOVED this salad so I will definitly make it again! Next time I will follow other's suggestions and add some grilled asparagus and roasted bell peppers. Thanks!

This was fabulous, but even better with the following additions. I tossed some halved mushrooms in a little of the dressing and put them under the broiler till done. Also added some homemade croutons. Cut some good Italian country bread into large chunks and saute in olive oil till crunchy on the outside but still a little soft in the middle. Sprinkle some parmesan on and stir till melted. Wow!!!

I reviewed this back on 08/26/02 when I first tried it and just had to come back and rave some more. Excellent. Since then I've made this many times, my girlfriend left me (20 lbs heavier - she blames my cooking) hehe. Tonight I did the salad with red and yellow bell peppers for color, as well as taking a previous reviewers suggestion on cucumbers (great). I'm not a big blue cheese fan so I go with far less than the 3oz the recipe calls for, I like a nice subtle touch of it. This still has to rank as my all time favorite recipe on epicurious.

This steak tasted incredible, I ate it on its own, but I think it would probably be great in a salad as I would think the steak by itself is a little too strong for most palates. I'm a rather novice cook, so this may have just been my inexperience, but when I made this, fumes from the spices went into the air and everyone in my apartment started choking. So as long as you can go without breathing for a few minutes, this dish is worth it, but it might be better to make it in a space that isn't enclosed.

This recipe is delicious, specifically the spice mixture. I used spicy hungarian paprika and the results were delicious. Also to cut down on fat, we broiled the steaks and I used about half the amount of oil as called for in the recipe and we didn't miss it at all. I will never make my steaks another way.

Rating: 4
This is absolutely amazing!! I did make a few changes: I added the butter to the pan instead of dipping them-just make sure you constantly move the butter around so it doesn't burn. Also, I added the blue cheese to the salad before I put on the meat, so the meat can slightly melt it. The only other addition is we add grilled asparagus done on the barbeque in a sesame oil. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM

Good steak salad. I think steaks should be thicker (1 inch or even more). That assumes you like a rare steak. Used london broil meat instead of tenderloin. Worked fine. Be careful not to overly spice the steak. Some of my pieces were a little over the top.

Fantastic! One of the best recipes I've tried. My husband asks for it all the time. It also has a very nice presentation. The only change I make is to put the onions (shallots also work nicely) in a food processor and whisk them into the dressing. Delicious!

OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GOOD! Definitely open your kitchen window wide before you cook -- the smoke is overwhelming. But soooooooo worth it. The steaks I used were a little on the thin side, so 2 minutes per side left them well done. I skipped the blue cheese (blech). Also, I didn't have any garlic powder, so instead I sauteed a clove of garlic (whole) in the butter that I later dipped the steak in. Really, really, really delicious.

I made this yesterday and it turned out great!. I loved the steak. The spice rub was awesome. Went well with the salad dressing. Will be making this again!

This salad is wonderful. I served it at a luncheon, and was able to do much of the prep prior to my guests arrival. I will be making it again.

Delish! Really a 'light' dinner. Couldn't help but wash it down with a cold IPA. Yum.

Delicious, fast, and easy. I used yellow bell pepper for great color.

Was great using thick ribeyes. Cut out the cayenne on my husbands and was still good. Think it would be good using other dressings as well - although I'm a huge fan of oil & vinegar dressings, my husbands a creamy dressing guy. Might try a creamy Italian or Caesar.

My husband is a huge fan of every main ingredient of this recipe (blue cheese, steak & salad) so I definately had a shoe in when preparing this. However I am only a fan of salad but I thought this recipe was extremely delicious! We were both thoroughly pleased especially since we enjoy very flavorful dishes.

This was simple and delicious. My butcher was out of filet so I substituted strip steaks and it was just as good I'm sure. The spice rub would be fabulous on pork tenderloin as well. Next time I will cut back ever so slightly on the olive oil but all in all this was the best salad I've gotten off this sight. Just great!

My husband and I loved this dish! Being a little shy about the amount of cayenne, I followed another reviewers advice and reduced the amount by half. An outstanding meal, one that my husband wants to serve at our next dinner party.

UNBELIEVABLY good! I have seen recipes that combine blue cheese and steak before, but the blackening spices and use of fresh tomato made this amazing. I'm hooked.

Only the second main course recipe that I've given 4 forks. Followed the recipe as written. Used frozen filet mignons. My wife, not a red meat eater, cleaned her plate.

This is FABULOUS. We love to have salads for dinner but I usually get into the Chicken Caesar or Cobb Salad rut. This is a great alternative, and was definitely hearty enough for dinner. Wouldn't change a thing, and I can't wait to make it again. Great flavors. I might try it with chicken too.

My husband must have told me at least five times how much he liked this the night i made it...and still kept on about it the next day. I have a feeling he liked it. Since i did a double-take on the amount of cayenne in the recipie, i reduced it to 1/2t just in case it was a typo and it was still very spicy - it almost choked me out of the kitchen cooking it. It was still worth it! The salad with it is a must - great compliment to the spice!

This recipe deserves an A+. My "not-too-fond-of-salads" husband thought it was outstanding. The only changes that I made were to suit our particular tastes: I roasted small red potatoes (1/4'd first) in a mixture of olive oil, kosher salt, course pepper & garlic powder. I bbq'd a large portobello mushroom and split it between the two salads. Instead of cayenne pepper I used habanero powder (great addition!), and I bbq'd the steaks. My husband thought the tenderloin steak should have been served on the salad plate whole to retain heat longer but I think it would take away from the presentation. This is a keeper!

Very tasty and easy. I only used half of the oil in the dressing and grilled the steaks without using any butter for a more lowfat dish. Still very delicious! I will try adding some grilled mushrooms and/or roasted potatoes next time.

This recipe is outstanding! The dressing is wonderful and the flavors totally compliment each other. Serve with a nice red wine and some french bread.
