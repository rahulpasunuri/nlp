This is the BEST relish. I can loads of it every year. I can't eat a hot dog without it being smothered with this relish. My one tip is don't bother peeling and coring and chopping the zucchini. Just grate the whole thing, much easier. But the chopped bell pepper and onion add good texture and color variety and is great in combination with the threads of zucchini.

We are new to making relish in my house, and we are wondering if you weigh the four pounds or zucchini before or after the coring and peeling?

With the first "abundance" of zucchini, I tried this recipe. It was easy and absolutely delicious. Certainly worth a try with this years' crop. I'm sure you'll enjoy it!

The taste is reminiscent of good old fashioned bread and butter pickles. I did leave out the bell pepper which I don't care for and it was still very tasty. Instead of a chop, I sliced the zucchini and onions very thin. Delicious.
