Delicious and summery. I used the pre-cooked shrimp. It will get rubbery if left in the marinade longer than 24 hours.

I made this for a summer cocktail party. It was sooo easy (took only 10 minutes with pre-cooked shrimp), and wonderful for a hot summer night. Very refreshing and flavorful. I only marinated it for 5 hours or so, and it was still excellent, but I think it would be even better if left overnight.

I thought this would be better with less fennel seed, less garlic, and more crushed red pepper.

Easy and showy. I didn't realize the shrimp were supposed to marinate, and didn't get it made until a couple of hours before my party. Nonetheless, they were plenty savory.

This recipe makes an excellent party dish as it can be prepped quickly and the day before.
