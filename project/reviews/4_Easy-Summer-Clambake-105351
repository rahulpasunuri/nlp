A lot of fun to make and eat. I made it for the 2 of us and used 1 lobster ($30! I do live in the desert) and 16 clams and cut everything else in half.

This has become a summer tradition for us, it is very simple and very impressive for guests. We've substituted lobster tails and crab legs and it works great. Potatoes need a bit more time than recipe calls for.

Made this for Father's Day Dinner and it was a huge hit! Added mussels to the mix, used lobster tails in place of whole lobsters, vidalia onions and white wine in place of the water for the broth. Also added 2 lemons that had been halved for some added zip to the broth.

I had made this a while back and everyone loved it! I'm planning another gathering this weekend and decided to make it again. Lost the recipe somewhwere in my stack of magazines, and am so excited that I found it here!

I made this recipe for five people and we all had a great time making it and eating it! My friends had to say it rated as the best meal they had all year!

I had a dinner party at my house serving 8 guests to try out this recipe. they went CRAZY, and everyone was covered in butter when it was over. I substituted king crab legs for the lobster, and served it with a green salad, crusty bread, grilled filet mignon, and a peach cobbler. Add a couple good bottles of wine, and you have yourself one impressive meal. This will become a summer tradition for sure!

I made this for company. It was great. The broth left something to be desired though. Next time I make it I will double the herb butter, as it was popular on the corn and potatoes as well as the lobster.
