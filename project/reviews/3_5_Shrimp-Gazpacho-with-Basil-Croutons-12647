A terrific gazpacho. I doubled the recipe and used sherry vinegar instead of the red wine. I otherwise would not change a thing. It is beautiful served in a martini glasses with the shrimp hanging on the edges of the glass.

This is a good base but needs some tweaking. I added a ton of fresh cilantro, a little tomato juice and some hard bread to the soup before pureeing it which gave it an excellent texture. I also just blended it all instead of chopping part of the vegtables, which means with an immersion blender this soup takes about 10 minutes to make.

The croutons were a highlight. Lots of chopping in this recipe, but the dish was a healthy delight. I didn't add the additional cherry tomatoes, plenty of tomotoes already.

Excellent. I made it without the shrimp, but my guests loved the flavors and raved about the croutons.

The gazpacho was delicious. We marinated & grilled the shrimp & served on the side - per other reviewers suggestions. We could live without the basil croutons, but it's a nice idea that I may work with for other recipes.

This recipe is simple and great, especially paired with the basil croutons. It is good with the shrimps, but they aren't really nescessary- I like the idea of serving grilled shrimps alongside the soup instead of the boiled shrimps under the soup. Also- being midwinter- I used canned diced tomatos- which were delicious, however I can't wait to use garden fresh ones!

This as so good! I did find it needed the ice water to achieve the right constistancy. Chopped shrimp (or small, whole shrimp) really rounds this out. Excellent!

We really enjoyed this! We grilled the tomatoes, red and jalapeno peppers, and onion before making the soup. It gave it a warm rich flavor that was accented by the shrimp. We didn't have time to make the croutons, so we added fresh chunks of avocado. It was great!! We're making it again this weekend for some friends!

Everyone loved it. Easy to do but took a little longer than I expected. I did peel the tomatoes. Also, I think the tomatoes MUST be the very best vine ripened. Alex Murray,

Excellent! Skip the croutons. Double the cucumber, try vidalia instead of red onion, skip the ice water, enjoy! Dr. Lile

This has become our standard gazpacho recipe. Great flavors and the addition of the croutons and shrimp take gazapacho out of the ho-hum category. Perfect!

We have taken this Gazpacho to many different outdoor concerts. We've had it at an outdoor Shakespeare Festival, at an Opera Sing at a winery, and we'll be taking it Sunday night to Beethoven at the Vineyards. We really think this Shrimp Gazpacho is very special. The croutons are difficult to make but sure are worth it!

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe. It sounded delicious, but making the croutons and shrimp required a lot of extra time and effort and the payoff wasn't there. For the amount of time I spent peeling/ deveining the shrimp, I was not at all compensated with an intriguing, or even notable, flavor. Plus, while the croutons were delicious on their own, the minute they were added to the gazpacho they became a soggy, unappealing mess. I served this at a dinner party and unfortunately it did not go over at all. As a gazpacho lover, I think I've discovered that simplest is best.

Very good. I would use only half of the jalapeno. I seeded it,but the whole thing was a bit to firery.

I had to strain the soup after I pureed it because of the many tomato seeds. I suggest you seed the tomatoes before pureeing it. I left out the crutons altogether, but it was super delicious. I also used pre-cooked bay shrimp instead of doing my own. Would definitely make it again.

This was a delicious gazpacho. The croutons were so tasty with it--they certainly add to the flavor of the soup. Our guests just loved it and asked for the recipe.

This is sooooo goooood! The shrimp did add a nice texture and (I thought)subtle flavor. I incorporated elements of the Spicy Gazpacho recipe... 1/2 can green chilis, 1/4 cup drained capers (jus cuz I luv em so), 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 Tbls. chili powder, and 1 torn up piece of whiteish bread. I thinned it with chilled spicy V-8. I was lazy and didn't do the croutons... I will next time.

I like this gazpacho - even without the shrimp because it is all fresh and very tasty. I do add some basil to the soup and love the easy to make croutons. I make a bunch and serve them with several batches of the soup. I nearly panicked when I thought I couldn't find this recipe.

This was a refreshing treat on a 90 degree day! I could take or leave the shrimp, though. They added a nice difference in texture, but the mild flavor was overwhelmed by the zippy soup. I added quite a bit more than the recommended amount of vinegar. I'd definitely make this again.

fabulous recipe, I made it for my "a mid-summers nite dinner party" last night, I served it for a first course, with grilled skewers of garlic shrimp--shrimp marinated in olive oil, garlic, chopped parsley, and seasoned dry breadcrumbs, with a little lime juice

A fancier gazpacho, this soup is perfect for a summer dinner that needs to be light, but still needs drama. Make the croutons--they're easy and will impress guests.

spicy, low cal, delicious (Michele says "Excellent!") recipe. Surpisingly, it didn't call for basil to be added to the gazpacho, only the croutons, which I did not make (who needs the extra oil?). So, I added basil and some cilantro which complemted the dish well. Will definitely make this again.
