Good fish recipe. The vegetables and the spicy sauce cover the fish taste considerably. My son who hates fish ate the most fish he ever has with this dish. The Ajvar substitute is good but spicy, my 8 year old daughter had difficulty with the spiciness. This is a great one dish meal that is quick and easy. I will make it again for sure.

I sort of made this tonight - no celery, so I just used a bit more parsley, subbed haddock (12 oz.) for the halibut and butter beans for Great Northern. In any case, it turned out great - I'm the only fish eater in our house, so I'll be eating this for the next couple of days for lunch. DH and DD don't know what they're missing!

I liked this dish very much! I did not use the potatoes, but I doubled the white beans. I personally added sliced green beans, because that is something I had just purchased, it was delicious!

I made my own "ajvar" sauce from the ingredients suggested and used only half with the vegetable mixture. I also used half of the suggested garlic. The "agvar" sauce has a very distinct flavor and can be spicy if 2 T of the chili-garlic sauce is used. I would recommend either the beans or the potatoes. I did use both (fingerling potatoes) and it was delicious. The flavors go very well together and I will make it again.

As a personal chef I made this for a client. I prepared the vegetables and put in pyrex containers, leaving the halibut on top for them to bake until finished. I also froze the two other portions, and it came out fine. I made my own ajvar, and my clients raved about this.
