Phenomenal. Creamy, with a little bit of sharpness from the sour cream. I used a blend of black and white pepper, so it was anything but bland. I'd never made (or had) kugel before, but my roommate and best friend are old hats at it and said it was fantastic.

This was ok. A little bland.

Love this. I used 8 oz of noodles (about 2/3's of a 12-oz bag of noodles), 1/2 cup light sour cream, 1 (12 oz) container low-fat, large curd, cottage cheese, 1 chopped onion sauteed with dash of olive oil, 3 eggs, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 3-4 tbsp butter. Baked in square, glass casserole sprayed with pam. Note: for 12 oz bag of noodles, use 3/4 cup sour cream (or slightly more), 16 oz cont. cottage cheese, 5 eggs, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper (or to taste),1 onion sauteed in olive oil, 4-5 tbsp butter. Add dash of paprika. Bake in rectangular, glass pyrex baking dish (13X9). Delish- serve with sour cream, seasoned salt and pepper. Close your eyes and think PIEROGIS! :) edit this note :

Super kugel, but please don't serve it with pot roast!

This is a fantastic recipe.. easy and yummy. It was a hit with my four year old...there's a tip. I made it with maccheroni and threw in a good handful of chopped Italien parsley. I served with grated parmesan cheese.

THE BEST. I did it as written and then did it again with low fat dairy to see what would happen. Either way, it's wonderful. The only difference: I baked the kugel in 1/2 cup muffin tins; took less time and they look great on the table. 10 minutes before taking them out of the oven, I sprayed them with a bit of canola oil spray to make them look nicer.

I multiplied this by 6 with great results, even using black pepper. It made 2 completely full 13x9x2 pans. I served it with tomato chutney (Gourmet December 1994) and the combination was very rewarding.

This was fabulous!!! A great side dish that my whole family enjoyed. I took it out of the oven and sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese on the top and it melted quite nicely. I will be making this again!

This was wonderful, my neighbor made a similar noodle pudding, however she added a can of drained fruit cocktail, which is how I made it and it brought back wonderful memories. Marge

This is just like my mother's recipe, but she always added drained sliced canned (not fresh) peaches.Try it as a great variation!

Very good basic recipe. I served it as a side dish with roast duck. I made it the night before dinner and actually ate some cold. It is as good cold as it is hot. Next time I may try adding spinach and garlic. A good basic like this lends itself well to variation. Also, I used regualr cottage, regular butter, and regular sour cream..... not all that fat-free crap!

After trying 3 different recipes, I finally found the one that's perfect. It's simple - I put the noodles into a big aluminum pan, tossed in all the other ingredients, stirred it up and baked. I doubled the recipe for a party so I took it out of the oven, and took it to the party. Great as left over, even cold. Forgot to write that I added sugar instead of salt.

I am about to make this dish for the third time since it appeared in Gourmet a short time ago. It is so good! Pretty simple too. Don't worry if you don't have cottage cheese And sour cream in the house, I used yogurt as a substitute for one or both and it works fine.
