Brilliant recipe! As noted by several people, these meatballs are super delicious. We have started a tradition with our grandkids "Spaghetti Night" and because of their pallets, and appetites we double the recipe and use 1/2 spicy It sausage and 1/2 sweet It sausage, makes for a wonderful dinner with some garlic bread.

This recipe made me feel like I had an Italian grandma who loved me. My hubby's ultimate and favorite comfort food. Super meaty so I reserve it for really bad days or really good ones. I have sub turkey sausage and/or omitted meatballs for a good weekday recipe (I tend toward vegitarian). Simple, adaptable and perfect!

This was fantastic, but a lot of work. For that reason, my family loved it more than I did. However I have enough leftovers for a couple of meals and will probably appreciate it more when I haven't been labouring over it for 3 hours! I would cut the salt back a bit though. I agree with the reviewers, I think they are the best meatballs I ahve ever made.

I used pork/veal/beef mix and added a bit extra garlic and fresh herbs (basil). i also baked on 350 - some for 20minutes and then added to the simmering sauce... and some for an extra 10-15 minutes and then added to sauce at the end. both ways were excellent - i couldn't tell the difference. but i'm sure the less baked ones added flavor to the sauce. (used the accompanying sauce minus the sausage. i served with Rigatoni...everyone luuuved them.

I just made this dish with a few alterations, and it was one of the best spaghetti dishes I've ever had. I used about a half of a cup of bread crumbs, instead of the bread slices, and splashed it with a few ounces of milk just before mixing it in with the meat. I did not use an egg. I also chopped and sauteed a small onion and mixed that in with the meat. I drowned the meatballs in Barilla spicy pepper spaghetti sauce and poured the whole mess over penne pasta. Yum.

Rating: 4
Found I did not need the egg. There was enough moisture with the bread soaked in milk. I added 100 grams of ground pork. I served it with simple tomato sauce without the sausage. It was delicious and perfect winter comfort food.

I served this to guests I had never met; from Spain. We all loved it! I simmered the tomato-sausage sauce with a 2 inch rind of parmesan- reggiano I had in the freezer and baked half the meatballs after watching my first half fall apart in the fry pan. This is such a hearty sauce that we used the leftovers on sub buns for a fun twist on a meatball sandwich. Definitely a crowd pleaser for those who enjoy meat.

Sorry, but am I missing something? Why would I go to the trouble of making meatballs, only to serve it with a spaghetti sauce that has whole sausages in it?

These meatballs are the best! For the meat I use ground sirloin, veal or pork or a mix of any of them. I also bake the meatballs 20 minutes @ 350, turning once or twice, then simmer them in the Tomato-Sausage Sauce to cook the rest of the way.

Rating: 4
Absolute tomato-y deliciousness. Never used the hot Italian sausage before and was quite pleased with the results. Deep flavors and richness in this sauce while the meatballs are tender and flavorful. The only change I made was to cut the oil by half and after finding the sauce a bit on the acid-y side, I followed another poster's hint and added about 2 teaspoons of honey which did much to mellow the taste. This is Bon Appetit's simplified version of Mary Gareffa's sauce recipe ("This quick and easy version of Marys heirloom recipe is ready in under an hour.") - I would love to have the heirloom recipe that her father taught. Must be out of this world!

I made this for a "comfort food" potluck and even though it was surrounded by trays of mac 'n cheese and other great food, this was the one pot that was empty at the end of the night. Several people asked me for the recipe!

Apologies to the purists, as I made a few changes. I had ground turkey so made turkey meatballs. I crumbled the sausage in the sauce. I also added a little bit of wine before simmering. The result was wonderful-- comfort food at its best and better than many 'red sauce' Italian restaurants. My husband and I wanted to lick the bowls.

Wow! This sauce is fabulous, and it's even better the next day reheated. For the sausage sauce, I used mild turkey sausage and crumbled the filling, I liked the texture of the resulting sauce better. For the meatballs I added extra garlic AND some finely chopped fresh rosemary- delicious!

This is an excellent recipe for meatballs. I followed it mostly as written, with some extra cheese and garlic thrown in. I mixed everything together with a hand mixer, which integrated the soaked bread very well. I baked them in the oven, 350 for 30 minutes, which worked wonderfully and is much easier than frying. The result: tender, flavorful meatballs! (I served them over spaghetti with a simple marinara rather than the sausage sauce listed here.) Everyone loved them.

i love this lady's meatball recipe! it's like a basic one that you can add-on to, or not (it tastes really, really good as is). i've been using her recipes for a few years now, and always add something extra if i have anything suitable on hand on a particular day - chopped cilantro, minced onion, raisins, chinese parsley, a tiny bit of shredded kaffir lime leaves (very un-italian, i know!), extra parmesan, load of extra pepper. i fry them for a few seconds first to 'seal' them before adding into the tomato sauce. tender, meaty and delicious...

This recipe was very good. I cut the recipe in half. I also added Worchestershire sauce to the meatballs and also some italian spices. For the tomato sauce, I made a recipe of my own with onions, garlic, herbs and crushed tomatoes. Very tasty!

Meatballs are heaven! I used italian croutons instead of bread, threw all ingredients in "Magic Bullet" with fresh parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, crushed red pepper, egg,salt and pepper, minced garlic, EVVO and Wham! Combined the greenish goop to 1 lb. ground beef and baked the meatballs at 350 for 20 mins. Wow. Add to your favorite sauce for the last hour of simmering and watch your dinner guests become catatonic.

Rating: 4
Exactly what I was looking for - delicious! Definitely use the suggestions in the comments section for best results. My changes: I used a mix of 1/2 ground veal, 1/2 ground sirloin; added a few dashes of red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning to spice it up a little; used the food processor to mix (per Falls Church's instructions); baked at 350 for 25 minutes or so. My husband and I both wanted to eat the other half of the recipe immediately upon finishing dinner. This will certainly be a key player in our rotation from now on.

My husband & I loved these meatballs. Very tender and tasty. I used 1/2 ground veal & 1/2 ground beef. Squeeze as much milk out of bread as possible & mix up very well; I did not bother to use the food processor (as some recommend) and it turned out fine just by mixing with my hands. Also baked for 20-25 min. at 350 degrees instead of frying. Sauce was good, basic, but could probably be spiced up a bit with some additional herbs & maybe some crushed red peppers.

Simple and good. I used Angus Brand ground sirloin and Zingerman's Paesano Bread. The crust broke up perfectly. The only change I made was for the sake of my six year old. I left out the parsley. I'm sure I'll make it again.

I used another reviewer's suggestion and made this with half a pound of pork and half a pound of veal. Both my girlfriend and I agree it's one of the best meatball dishes we've ever had. My only complaint is that it's hard to stop the meatballs from sticking to the pan, and a few always end up crumbling apart when I try to cook them. It doesn't make them any less tasty, but if folks have tips for keeping the meatballs in ball form, I'd love to hear it.

i used the meatballs recipe and made my own standby sauce consisting of tomatoes, garlic, sweet onion, dried chinese mushrooms and chopped celery. served with spaghetti - the meatballs are soooo tender and rich from the milk-soaked bread and parmesan! i've made the meatballs with variations on the sauce for about 4 times now. a fantastic, easy and goofproof recipe.

I've been making this dish on New Year's Day for the last 3 years and plan to continue. It's such a treat, but is so rich that once a year is enough. I use the beef/pork/veal mix, and find that baking the meatballs is much easier (25 min @ 350). For leftovers, I make meatball sandwiches on toasted hot dog buns.

I make this regularly and have toyed with it. Regular white bread works fine - 2 or 3 slices. Less if you want a meatier ball. I've substituted finely diced onions. Also I usually make a lot at a time and place them in big a Ziploc bag sitting on a plastic or paper plate. Freeze until they are hard enough to hold their shape, and the plate can be removed. Then on any given nite, a spaghetti dinner can be ready in 15 min.

This was a great classic Spaghetti and Meatball combo. I'd make 1/2 the meatball part since I ended up with too many meatballs (which I froze for next time). I also didn't put any meat in the sauce. I would definitely make this again - has a great flavor.

I really liked this recipe. My boyfriend was quite impressed with the whole meal! I must admit it was relatively easy, although next time I will make a few alterations i.e. using pork/veal/beef mixture for the meatballs and baking them, and adding some red wine and mushrooms. I too had some trouble with the bread crust pieces, next time I will either use a mixer or cut off the edges. Other than that, I enjoyed making it as much as I will enjoy eating it for the next couple of days since I made a lot!!

I love this recipe, as does the family. Easy to prepare, and the sauce is good either as is (a little bland, but what Basic isn't at times :) or spiced up in the usual red-spaghetti-sauce ways (various veggies, or wine, balsamic vinegar, whatever etc. I have on hand). I like to double all elements (except the pasta, of course) and freeze some; it all reheats well. I also found it really doesn't matter how much I 'healthy up' the recipes(lowfat sausage; wheat bread; lowfat milk, ground turkey meatballs...), it's still good! Good either way. Mmm.

This was excellent. I took most cooks' advice -- from adding grated carrots, red wine, and sliced mushrooms to using a half pound of mixed hot and sweet Italian sausage -- and it turned out scrumptious. A couple of improvements I'd suggest: Don't put all of the sauce on all of the pasta. There's enough for two to three meals here, and you'll end up having to bake or microwave the leftovers. For a fresher taste, I'd prefer to dip the noodles in boiling water and to simply reheat the sauce. And, true, as one reviewer pointed out, this dish is meat-heavy...but the sausage adds exquisite flavor and it all blends well. Due to the large amount of sauce produced, I'd recommend making this with 1.5 pounds of spaghetti.

Rating: 4
We loved the meatballs. I followed the reader from Falls Church's advice and used my electric mixer with great results. I then baked them for 25 minutes, cooled them, then froze in a large plastic bag as another reader suggested. I also froze the sauce. It was such an easy meal to put together the next week when we were busy sightseeing with out-of-town company.

To the cook from Winnipeg: I have prepared cocktail size meatballs, baked in 350 oven for 15 minutes. I cool, place on cookie sheets & freeze. Then I put them in a bag/container & can take out as many as I want for whatever. For spaghetti, you might want the meatballs larger. If so, bake 20-25 minutes. I would also freeze some of the pan drippings to add to the sauce for flavor.

instead of bread use italian bread crumbs and most and evry important add two small boxes of 1oz. RAISINS.Now you may think this is strange but my grandmother was from Italy and came over to NY in the early 1920's and she made her meatballs with Raisins and they were the rave of the family. Now also all the Italians in the area made them that way too. They brought this over with them too. We have been making our meatballs for family and friends all our lives and have passed it along all this time. They love them.

Definitely need to use a food processor to break up the bread. This recipe made a delicious and tender meatball. I baked the meatballs instead of frying it, it works just as well.

Rating: 4
Amazing flavor and texture. I heeded the warnings about combining the bread and I think this process may help everyone. I first combined the egg, cheese, salt, pepper, parsley and garlic in my electric mixer. Then, I added the bread and mixed it on high for about 20 seconds. This pretty much pulverizes the bread. Finally, I added the meat and mixed on medium high for 30 seconds. The mixture was very uniform and the end result was a very moist and flavorful meatball.

Just finished dinnner and had to log on to let everyone know how pleased I was of this recipe. The tip in the comment section made all the difference. Thanks everyone!

This recipe captures to a tee the spaghetti made by my Italian mother and grandmother. Over the years, I had tinkered so often with my own sauce recipe that I yearned to go back to the wonderful taste of my youth. This recipe never fails to please everyone in my family. It makes a wonderful base for lasagna as well. Don't be tempted to replace the Italian sausage with ground beef -- it adds the perfect balance to this very basic, yet very special dish.

Rating: 3
I thought these were great - I'd note a couple things: 1) break up the bread very well before combining with the other ingredients. I combined everything in the bowl right after squeezing the bread dry, and ended up with squashy and sort of unappealing chunks of soft bread in the cooked meatballs because I was afraid I'd overhandle the mixture if I tried too hard to break the bread up while mixing. Distributing the bread more evenly would have helped it be more of a binder as well - my meatballs were a little crumbly (but no less tasty for that). 2) Cooking these in the oven was a huge plus: no grease splattering on the stove, and a great browned exterior with no added fat. Pop in a rimmed baking sheet and bake in a preheated 350 oven for 20-30 minutes or so, shaking occasionally.

I was just going through some recipes and saw this and though I didn't make it...it's very authentic. My husband is from Naples and we have gone there several times and the meatballs are pretty much how they make them there. The sauce is pretty authentic, too. It's called a ragu` in Italy and also includes braciola. Try adding some red wine before adding the tomatoes and fry up the meatballs in the same pot as the sausage. Also, I don't use bread soaked in milk, I cheat and use plain dried bread crumbs, and the meatballs are still moist and delish...try it.Also, the Italians NEVER eat a ragu` with spaghetti, it's always eaten with rigatoni or ziti. It was news to this Irish girl, too.

Not a hit at our house. It was very bland(especially the meatballs)even with the spicy sausage in the sauce (I sliced them to try and drive a little more flavor in as it simmered). My family much prefers a simple meat sauce made with jarred sauce,canned diced tomatoes (to cut the sweetness)and sauteéd 50/50 of leand grd beef and hot Italian sausage. It is also much faster! If I'm going to spend more time the flavor needs to be more spectacular than this recipe.

Like others, I made the meatballs from a 2:1:1 combo of sirloin, pork and vea. Also, I simmered them in the sauce for the better part of the day. It's quite easy to forget about them, it smells delicious and the sauce, if you have leftovers, is savory and filling. This wasn't a blow-you-over flavorful sauce, but it was a stellar comfort meal, which is what spag and meatballs is all about for me, anyway. Yum!

I am an Italian American, and this is pretty close to the way my family makes this dish. I have learned that frying the meat isn't really necessary...you can just as easily put it in the simmering sauce. I usually add red wine to the sauce and serve it with cheese raviolis

I made the meatballs with the veal/beef/pork combo as suggested, and they were wonderful. I served them with a marinara sauce, but next time I'll make the suggested sausage sauce. I highly recommend these meatballs - and they were fantastic in hot meatball sandwiches for a few days after too!

Never made meatballs before but have made this recipe twice in a month and it will be a family favorite. Enjoyable to make and very good.

This was good, but not overwhelmingly great. I think there's just too much going on. While both the sausage and the meatballs are good, they seem to fight with each other. Next time, I'd choose one or the other. Also, the method of soaking the bread results in pretty hefty chunks of bread in the meatballs--in spite of efforts to break it up into small pieces. Tastes okay, but the look isn't terribly appealing.

Instead of using 4 spicy Italian sausages in the sauce, I used 2 turkey sausages (really because this was all I had in the freezer). I took the sausage out of the casings before cooking to spread it throughout. I'm sure it cut down on the fat and I would make it this way again. Another change I made (again, out of necessity) - instead of using 1 1/2 28-ounce cans of crushed tomatoes in the sauce, I used 1 28-oz can of crushed, and 1 14-oz can of Preseasoned Pasta Style Chunky Tomatoes.

When my husband told me he wanted meatballs, my heart sunk. I've never made them and picked this recipe from several on this web site (with my fingers crossed). They were delicious and even my pickest eater, my five year old daughter, ate them up. I, too, baked them at 350 for 20 mts, turning once. I added a little bit of minced onion and used 1/2 ground sirloin and 1/2 ground pork. Definitely a keeper!

Delightful dish. The meatballs were moist and tender, and the sauce, very rich - the sausages do give it an extra kick. It´s really a very traditional italian meal. But it´s a bit too rich, there are too many flavors going on at once. Next time, I´ll decrease the olive oil in the sauce (there is such a thing as too much of a good thing!), and maybe not use the sausages, just the meatballs. I´d also make the sauce with extra sausages and not add the meatballs, for a change.

Rating: 2
The sauce is definately for the meat lover and probably just as good w/o the pasta. I regretfully followed the recipe and cut up the sausages instead of removing from the casings and browning them that way. While the sauce was good (the husband liked it), and very chunky (sausages + meatballs) I still prefer another recipe on this website and will stick with that one.

MMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. ABE. While I don't like sausage, I used chicken breast pieces in place of the meat balls. wow. I think Bon Apetit has finally outdone itself. Isn't a marinara supposed to have a bit more kick? I added some basil and crushed red pepper and other than that the sauce was perfect. I breaded the chicken and served it atop of the pasta (I used penne) and the sauce. I'll make this over and over. My companion has finally stopped asking for Ragu and insists I make this dish whenever we want italian! oh right ... added some mushrooms too. we love those sinful delights! Cheers, Skyye

Great recipe, but not one that I would try again in the shape that it currently is. I don't know if the Italians originally planned all their food bland and lifeless, but it certainly seems to have become the norm these days. Spice it up! Add some flavor! Give it some life! When I last made this, the people I were entertaining did not like the 'raw' taste of meat, so I made the meatballs 3/4 of meat and 1/4 of freshly mashed potatoes and garlic. This really made the meatballs plump, tender, and they held together marvellously without losing out any on flavor. I totally agree with the fact that the dish tastes better if you let it sit in the fridge overnight. When you take it out, theres less sauce and its thicker, so what I did is to flesh it out again with a dash of red wine while reheating! C'est incroyable!! Do try it, its not 'proper' but it leads to a very tasty dish!

A very good recipe. Only my Italian father makes better meatballs. As always, the meatballs were better the next day after spending a night in the sauce. But I had a bit of a problem w/ the bread crumbs... there turned out to be a few bread chunks in the meatballs. Next time I would chop up the bread a bit before adding the milk and would spend more time mushing it up before combining it w/ the meat (esp. the crust). I made the sauce w/o the sausage and it was still great. Definitely a keeper (at least until I get my dad's recipe!) :-)

I agree with a previous reviewer that the meatballs are too "garlicky" although I think that is because the meatballs, as written, are not cooked long enough to make the garlic mild. Try adding a SMALL amount of roasted/cooked garlic to the meatballs, they are better that way.

My family really liked the whole recipe. The meatballs are really good. I added grated onion the second time I made them and fresh oregano instead of parsley. I believe it is the milk soaked bread that makes these so moist.

TRUST ME ON THIS!! For a nice kick on boring meatballs, ADD PORTABELLA MUSHROOMS!! Take your fresh PORTABELLAS, and put them in the food processor w/ your bread, garlic, one onion, and a pinch of crushed -dried ROSEMARY. Add this to your meatball mixture. DELICIOUSO!!!!!!

Liked the sauce, but will probably stick with another one that we preferred. However, we really enjoyed the meatballs. I have always made meatballs for spaghetti by placing them directly into the sauce instead of frying. I strongly suggest you might want to try this method and save the grease and mess of frying meatballs. Works wonderfully.

Took everyone's suggestion and substituted 1/4 pork, 1/2 sirloin - however, market was out of ground veal, so I substituted 1/4 ground lamb. The result was the best meatballs we've ever had.

Loved the sauce.. it is FANTASTIC! Not too thrilled with the meatballs though. They were a bit too garlicky for my taste and I don't think that the dish really needs them.

This recipe for a simple, but fresh sauce was wonderful. By the use of good canned tomatoes it was on the table in no time at all. I have it for leftovers today and I cannot wait for lunch!

The meatballs were delicious. I suggest substituting the 1 lb ground sirloin with 1/2 lb ground sirloin, 1/4 lb ground veal and 1/4 lb ground pork. This will prevent the meatballs from tasting like hamburger.

Loved the meatballs and wouldn't change that part of the recipe(although a dining companion felt they were too "bready").The sauce was oily in my opinion, and the sausage unnecessary with the meatballs.I would decrease the olive oil in the sauce by a couple of tablespoons, eliminate the sausage and substitute sliced mushrooms next time.

I live down in Colombia and I can't get Italian Sausages.As I'm orginally from Scotland I've never tasted them either.Can anyone tell me how to make them, or what I could substitute for them?I can get chorizos obviously but I think that this will probably give a completely different taste or not?

My family really enjoyed this classic dinner dish. I used a small cookie scoop to scoop the meat mixture onto a cookie cooling rack. I rounded up the edges, put the rack on top of a cookie sheet and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. It works everytime! Fast and not much grease. I also use this technique for Swedish meatballs.

I made this for the first time Sunday. My Sicillian fiancee loved it. Said it reminded him of the gravy his Mom maid growing up. Quite the compliment for this little Irish lady!

To the cook from San Fran--I bake meatball for appetizers by taking white bread, placing it on a cookie sheet. I maked depressions in it with my fingers and place a meatball in the depression. Then bake at 350 until cooked. This way the grease goes into the bread. Don't see why this technique wouldn't work here.

I thought this recipe was very, very good. However, next time, I would double the meatball recipe - make larger meatballs...and cook the meatballs in the sauce rather than frying them first. From your other reviews, I think the addition of a grated carrot certainly makes sense, as does the addition of some red wine. I did not have any sausage in casings in the house, so, I did use just sausage meat. I may try this entire recipe in my crock pot next time (with sausage in the casings). Surely this is a keeper. Everyone in my home enjoyed it very much. Thank you!

Her proportions are good and milk makes a tender meatball, however, we always used gound pork and veal. Don't like the taste of a beef meatball. However I baked mine, uncovered, in the sauce in a roasting pan at 350, turning them occasionally to let a crust form on the outside. Then I let them cool in the sauce and reheat what I need. If the sauce rests, I can usually skim any extra fat off the top.

Sauce could be enhanced by a splash or two of red wine and the addition of some grated carrot as a balance to the acidity of the tomatoes. Also, I would take the sausage out of the casings to better incorporate into the sauce. Just a suggestion-otherwise sounds great!

This was my first time making meatballs and it was easy and delicious. The soaked bread really made the meatballs moist. I pan-fried the meatballs according to the recipe but would love if someone could teach me how to bake the meatballs!??

Coming from a family of eight children, my mom always baked her meatballs so she could feed the army instead of frying forever. I find that making them this way is a heck of a lot more tender than frying in a skillet. I thought the sauce on this was so-so. I prefer mine with a "kick", and therefore added more spice and ended up changing the recipe. If you want a spicy change, use andouille instead of Italian sausage.

Was just curious to know if anyone tried baking the meatballs (that's how I do mine, less fat). I am going to try this recipe, sounds great.

Great basic spaghetti and meatball recipe. I made the sauce without any meat at all and still loved it. I will make it again!

Solid foundation but you can find room for improvement the next time around. All the same I would recommend this recipe.

Yummy and easy! I used pork, veal and beef in the meatballs. I doubled the sauce as 1 can tomatoes is not enough sauce for a lb of spaghetti. I added red wine and sauteed mushrooms to the sauce. I also sprinkled with fresh basil when serving. Leftover sauce & meatballs made great subs with grilled peppers & onions.

My husband made this. VERY GOOD. Loved the meatballs, but think the sauce can be improved. Anyway, to the previous reviewer/s...you need to double click on the sauce to get the recipee. Thanks to all!

Help!!! Did I miss something? Where is the Tomato-Sausage Sauce receipe???

Rating: 4
This is a classic recipe. I would echo what other reviewers have suggested--the best, most deliciously authentic combination is beef, pork, and veal. This is very similar to my Italian ex-mother-in-law's recipe, and boy could that woman cook. I add chopped fresh basil leaves at the end just before serving. This makes great meatball subs, too.

This is a fabulous recipe for Spaghetti & Meatballs. I will pass it on to family & friends. Marilyn of Chicago didn't click on the blue sauce access to get the sauce recipe. I will continue to use this recipe.

Classic Italian sauce (gravy where I come from) BUT, oregano is for pizza, bay leaf is for soup. I use a couple of fresh basil leaves, no sugar, no wine, that's it. Also whoever sent the tip about using half beef and a quarter each pork (which can be sausage out of the casing) and veal, that's my way too. The absoute best! Just cook it a good LOOONNNNNNG time. I usually start mine on Sunday morning when I get up for Sunday dinner.

Instead of using 1 pound of ground sirloin, use 1/2 pound ground sirloin and then 1/4 pound of ground pork and 1/2 pound of ground veal. At every butcher and some grocery stores too if you ask. Not joking - the meatballs will be SO MUCH BETTER. And to the cook that had the problem with the meatballs falling apart in the pan, this meat mix will definitely help with that. And also, before you put each one in the oil, wet your hands a little and drop them in. Works for me and has worked for my 85 year old grandmother her whole life!

Great recipe and very easy. My kids love spaghetti and meatballs but have been used to the frozen variety. These were very good! My 13 year old actually made the meatballs for me. The sauce was also quick and had a wonderful flavor. Read the recipe all the way through, the sausages stay whole while cooking. I always add a tablespoon or two of sugar to my sauce and did with this as well. Total comfort food.

I thought the meatballs were absolutely excellent and would definitely follow this recipe again. I cannot really rate the sauce, however, as I found myself adjusting it to my own recipe. As written, there is not enough crushed tomatoes for my taste. I added about 4 more 28 oz cans, some red wine, more herbs, etc., and cooked it for about 4 hours as it was a lazy Sunday afternoon. I did finish the meatballs in the sauce. Despite the addition of so much extra sauce, it was a very meaty sauce (the sausages I used were quite big and I chopped them all up).

Fantastic recipe! I will definetly make this again. Very tender and tasty meatballs. I had a bit of trouble keeping the shape of the meatballs when frying in olive oil. They were burning a bit and coming apart. Suggestions?

Never again will my family complain about my hockey puck meatballs. At last I know the secret. The meatballs were tender and delicious, and the sauce was out of this world. I couldn't decide whether to use sweet or hot Italian sausage so I used two of each and the combination was delcious. It was amazingly quick for such a rich delicious sauce. I'll definitely make it again.

This easy to make spaghetti tastes as if it had been simmering for hours! I do feel that the sausages were a little "over-kill" unless you love A LOT of meat in your sauce. I would either reduce the number of sausages to 2 or just make the meatballs, which were the best I've ever made!

This is a wonderful easy recipe. Spaghetti and meatballs sounds so simple until you try to make it. Unless you're Italian and have some secret family recipe, most versions of this dish leave something to be desired. But, this recipe is great. It was easy, straight forward and didn't take too long to put together. I wouldn't change a thing!
