Delicous recipe I prepared last night and enjoyed for dinner and lunch today. The only change I excluded the caviar and the lemon oil. Otherwise, the dish was absolutely delicious and smells wonderful.

I made two versions of this dish. For both, I used veggie stock and two handfuls of cashews, pureed, to make the soup vegan. (replacing the cream and chicken stock.) I didn't have caviar, or the lemon oil. So, I finely chopped some olives, which happened to be marinated in an herb and orange peel mix. That was an ok substitute for the salt and acid notes intended in the recipe. Would have loved to do the leeks as well, but didn't have any on hand. The scallops still sat nicely in a shallow bowl. For the third plate, I broiled zucchini rounds with olive oil, salt and pepper, as a vegan substitute. Even with all the mods, it was great, will try as written soon.

Excellent! The caviar may leak some dye and smudge the beautiful presentation.

This was sublime! I only made the soup part. I had a gorgeous Romanesco Cauliflower from the farmers market and I used that. Only had 3 little cocktail onions and they were enough. Used 1 cup of heavy cream. Soup was a lovely green color. My husband loved it. We ate it with crusty toast. It was super easy, quick, amazing and I will totally make it again. Since I used a Romanesco, we called it Cream of Fibbonaci Fractal Soup. Yum!!!!

Absolutely delicious; made a 2/3's receipe for 2 people for dinner with 4 scallops each, and had left-overs soup. Agree that the lemon oil at the end makes it very sepcial (I heated some oil, added lemon rind, cooked over low heat for 10 minutes, and let it rest until needed). No caviar, but the lovely coral-colored roe on the scallops gave the finished soup a festive look.

Stellar! I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and replaced the stock with water, for a lighter, vegetarian/pescitarian-friendly option. Simmered the sliced leek with the cauliflower for a more flavorful base. Be creative with garnishes if you don't want/have the scallops and caviar!

I made this soup tonite for dinner and it was a real winner. I added 3/4 tsp thyme and 1 small dried red chili pepper, I thought both were great additions. I changed the method just a bit. I sauteed the veggies as recommended but cooked them only in the broth. When done, I pureed the veggies and broth, returned to the pan, and then added the cream. Well actually, I used creamo (10%). I never had scallops so subbed in shrimp. I sprinkled them with a bit of cumin, chili pepper, paprika, salt and pepper, and then sauteed them in the last Tbsp of oil. For serving, I first ladled the soup into bowls and sprinkled with a few salad croutons. then I put the leeks and shrimp in the middle of the soup and sprinkled the chives over the top. I used about 3 shrimp per bowl. We loved this soup.

I have made this quite a few times. One of the best! I substituted butter for the oil and sauteed the cauliflower with the onins and garlic before adding the liquids - out of the park folks! Add a dash of champagne to it at New Years.

Wonderful! I would ABSOLUTELY make this again! Simple recipe, easy to follow. The different components provided great depth of flavor. I did not top with caviar, but followed the rest to the letter. Even my husband who is not a fan of cauliflower loved it. YUM!

There is only one word to describe this dish...SUBLIME! People were literally moaning in ecstasy while eating this. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly (a rarity for me) and made my own lemon oil from the zest of meyer lemons from my tree. It was excellent. Second time, I added a little curry powder, as I usually do with cauliflower dishes. I bought some pure lemon oil and used it to spike my home made lemon oil. These two simple changes sent it off the scale. Rapturous, heavenly. Whoever created this dish is a genius. I humbly bow in deep appreciation.

this is delicious after doctoring it, but a bit bland as written. Added white white, lemon thyme, and a splash of tabasco. Up the garlic to 3 cloves.Finish with truffle oil instead. Hubby did not like it, but I thought it was great.

this modest little soup is fantastic. If you don't want to splurge on the truffle oil, just add toasted pecans to the mixture before you puree it. It lends it an earthiness, without the price tag. And makes the color of the soup slightly darker, which I think looked more rustic.

Pretty easy to make and a real hit! Caviar is one of the reasons I checked this recipe out and I think it adds to the flavor. I'll try it with the tobiko next time. We ate this two nights in a row and my husband was sad that we didn't have it for the third night. Very elegant soup for a first course or make it as the entree with salad first. Perfect for the holidays.

Excellent recipe, perfect for company. I bought inexpensive caviar from World Market and it was delicious. Slightly undercook the scallop as it will continue to cook in the hot soup. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!!

I subbed creame with 2% milk, and this was still fantastic. The leek really does make a difference. Make sure both the scallops and oil are fresh. My husband loved this!

FANTASTIC. Tested this on the family, who kind of went, "What's the occasion, it's Mon nite....." All reviews re company 1st course are right on. So you spend $1 on the cauliflower, $30 on the additions - oh well. I put 3 scallops in each bowl; thought 5 inch chives in the center more artistic, since they are inconsequential to the taste. Used salmon roe, perfect for color. Also added parmesan to the puree. Use a flat soup bowl, so the scallops are little islands in your presentation.

This was absolutely excellent, decadent and very easy. Other than adding two scallops and serving sans caviar (store was out), I prepared exactly how it was written. Everyone loved it. Beautiful presentation. Next time, caviar.

This is so easy, and much enjoyed by a few rounds of dinner guests. Ran out of time and had to skip the leek part, but no one missed it. Was unable to get ahold of caviar, so used smelt roe, which was a pretty orange against the ivory soup and added a lovely texture. Forgot the chives one time, and it didn't make much difference. If you're serving small portions, go for the cream, but half-and-half is fine if you're serving full-sized portions.

May be the most outrageous item I've cooked in a long time...only substituted fresh chanterelles (sauteed with the onions and removed before adding stock/cream/cauliflower and used as garnish). The other cook was right, I used some Fat Free Half and Half (about half cup) with no difference.

A few drops of truffle oil instead...awesome.

A winner! I served this cold (with the scallops hot) as a main course with the mixed greens salad with goat cheese and almonds found on epicurious.com, along with brioche and glasses of Proseco. It was an elegant summer meal served to rave reviews. Feel tempted to use fat free half and half to lighten up -- it didn't significantly alter the taste.

I just had to write in about this recipe. Four forks, all the way& I prepped everything ahead of time except for searing the scallops and also prepped the bowls with piles of fennel. Once the guests arrived all I had to do was sear off the scallops, heat up the soup, ladle it out and garnish. It was such a great recipe and allowed me to spend more time with my guests. I skipped the caviar and the soup was still gorgeous, even in my ugly bowls. Seriouslyeven in 70s Corelle this soup would look first class! I am an intermediate- level cook who cant always perfectly replicate the recipes on this site, but Im telling you, if you follow the directions you cant really screw this up. Go for it! I hate to review a recipe for which I have made substitutions, but I did use half and half instead of the cream and it was still wonderful. The soup was rich and light, all at the same time. It was a perfect first coursenot too filling but just a nice, light start to a meal. I agree that you could add more scallops and serve as a main dish. I had two bowls of leftovers, one with the scallop and fennel and one just the soup by itself. Both were delicious. If you have leftover cauliflower, try the Roasted Cauliflower recipe& its super easy as well and I was amazed at how quick, easy and delicious it turned out.

This soup won a blue ribbon in a soup cook-off! It was a friendly (?) competition among faily accomplished cooks and it took top honors - no other soup even came close. To get the texture and flavor I was seeking, I did have to make a few changes including adding some white wine and a bit of ginger. I made my own lemon infused oil and I believe the lemon oil is what helps this dish really stand out. I also couldn't find fresh chives in my area in February so used some tarragon (just a bit). My daughters (11 and 13) also loved it. When you need an elegant first course any time of year, serve this soup. It is delicious!

I made this mostly following directions but omitted caviar. Husband and I loved it! We used small sea scallops and increased as others had to make it a main dish. Also increased broth and decreased 1/2 N 1/2 (rather than cream) proportionally. Delightful! Planning to make for company as it's very elegant.

So simple and easy. I made this as a main course for a weekday dinner. I added more scallops per dish but kept the other proportions. There is an oriental market nearby and I can always find salmon roe or flying fish roe there. This time, they didnt have the salmon roe so I used some red tobiko (flying fish roe) One benefit is that its not as salty as caviar. I will make this again.

I made this for our annual New Year's Eve dinner, and it was a favorite of the evening. I followed the recipe exactly. I did however have trouble finding lemon oil, so I made my own. I sauteed large pieces of lemon zest in olive oil over medium heat for approx. 4 min or until they start to brown. I strained immediately. It was easy and delicious. The caviar was expensive, but it pushed the recipe over the top. I think that it would be possible to do without however. This is the perfect soup for an elegant dinner. I will definitely make it again.

I liked this quite a bit and my guests raved about it. It made a delightful first course. I couldn't figure out the need for the leeks but they were a nice addition. I had to make my own lemon oil too, which was easy. I used the lemon oil to sear the scallops which was nice.

My fiance loves scallops, so I made this dish. I decided to make my own lemon infused oil. I googled it, and decided on 1/2 cup oil and the zest of two lemons - heated on the stove for 10- minutes, below a boiling temperature. Tasting the oil, I thought the lemon flavor was too weak, until it was served on the soup. The lemon flavor sang - like a fine soprano top note.

What a great recipe. The presentation was fantastic, as was the taste. I followed the recipe to the letter and would recommend not changing a thing. An ideal starter for a company dinner

Guests brought this soup to a collaborative dinner party last week, and it set the "gold standard" for all the courses that followed. It was fabulous in every respect--taste, texture, aroma, visual appeal. Some cheddar and pepper scones (also from Epicurious) complemented the soup wonderfully.

Excellent and impressive. I made it as part of a 4 course meal for my boyfriend's 40th birthday, and he LOVED it! I subbed fat free half and half for the cream - just to cut back on fat grams a bit. Luckily, we had leftovers, so we bought more scallops and had it again 2 days later. We couldn't find the big scallops, so we used 3 smaller ones per bowl. YUM!

I served this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it! I made it for 8 people, and added a little more cauliflower. I also used 3 cups chicken stock and only one cup of heavy cream--delish!
