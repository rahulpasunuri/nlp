Apparently, since I'm someone's 41 year old CHILD, I would not be allowed to enjoy this dessert/drink. Darn! I really think my niece would like it, too. She's 25. Get a grip people.

as for children... they love it too! Remember moderation is a learned life style. Little kids... little amount.

and to the cook from Milwaukee who asked about children... yes, even children love this! Moderation is a learned life style. Just serve the little ones, a little.

Since I discovered this delightful palate cleanser it is a must serve at every family celebration! Easy and the color is enough (well, almost) to make me think I live on a delightful warm island....

YUM! I can see this as a summer freezer staple. Very easy, refreshing, and delicious. I didn't let my children eat it, though...perhaps Philadelphia's children are grown.

An excellent between-courses palate cleanser. I served it in small blue-stemmed martini glasses for an elegant presentation.

I have made this reipe at least 20 times. It is not only a very refreashing palate cleanser it is beautiful. My children are especially fond of it and request it frequently. DJB - Philadelphia
