I followed some of the advice from previous posts and this is a "do again" recipe. I used half prepared bread crumbs and half panko and added a little almond milk to the wet mixture. I also added more parmesan cheese. We like our food heavily seasoned in this house so I will add more spices next time but that is our own personal preference. I used a well seasoned Pampered Chef baking stone so I could have eliminated spraying the baking surface. I had a bit of the soggy bottom so I transferred the chicken to a cooling rack so they didn't sit in the grease. I'm thinking that the next time I may try cooking it on a cooling rack and broiling at the end to crisp up the crust.

An easy and simple dinner. We would definitely make it again. My husband who tends to be more conservative with his rating gave it an easy 3 stars.

This was a good basic recipe but next time I would add additional cheese and spices. I added the olive oil to the lemon juice. I dipped the cooked product in apple sauce, so it is a bit of a kid's meal but an easy healthy one.

super boring. but good for kids, as long as you can talk them into the lemon aspect. a good vehicle for my friend's mango habanero salsa  without that, i probably would have died of boredom.

vietasgirl from NJ--you are ridiculous; one remark is enough. This recipe is very good and doesn't need a gazillion times the same remark from you. I used chicken breasts with the bones, wings, and thighs. Also I added a little crushed Corn Flakes to the crumb topping. SELF: This is great!

Yuck. Way too much lemon in this recipe. I had to force myself to eat it, not to mention my kids.

this was a delicious, quick, healthy weeknight meal. i followed the recipe except used lemon & pepper flavored breadcrumbs rather than plain, and it turned out fantastic. i didn't have the soggy bottom problem at all... followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. i only wished i had made more, it was so tasty! i will definitely make this again.

I also combined the olive oil with the lemon & water, it came out great. I used panko breadcrumbs instead of whole wheat, which still resulted in the soggy bottom some other reviewers mentioned, but I didn't really mind. I tried the broiler trick but that didn't work. For an easy, basic, delicious, healthy dish, this is a new staple in my rotation. Sweet potatoes and roasted broccoli round out the meal quite nicely.

I followed the advice of some other reviews and added the olive oil to the lemon/water mixture. The recipe was great and was perfectly crispy even without putting it in the broiler as others suggest. I mounded leftover breadcrumbs/cheese/lemon zest on top of the chicken pieces and thought that was a great strategy to enhance crispiness. I used fresh pecorino-romano since that's what was in the fridge, along with the lemon zest. The zest is what truly made the recipe. This will definitely make the regular rotation.

My family loved this dish. I used more lemon juice, which gave it a nice flavor. I turned on the broiler for the last five minutes of cooking to give it more "crisp." I also cut the chicken into finger size pieces. It was a hit and I will make it again.

Several reviewers claimed that the chicken was not crispy. So I toasted fresh bread crumbs that I made from a loaf of rosemary olive oil bread. This worked quite nicely and produced a crispier crust. I also followed another reviewer advice and added the olive oil to the lemon juice - which did the trick. The chicken was delicately seasoned with a touch of lemon and rosemary. I prefer more of the lemon taste coming throught. This also got me thinking - why not marinade the chicken in the lemon juice and olive oil mixture. So next time I'll give that a try,

This is quick and easy to prep, kid friendly, and pretty tasty although I add some extra seasoning. If you want it crispier try turning on your broiler for the last few minutes or an additional few, just be careful not to burn - let it brown a little more darkly and the outside will be more crisp... The chicken stays nice and moist!

While I agree that the "Crisp" should probably be removed from the recipe name, this chicken is one of my go-to recipe faves. Fresh lemon & parm are a must and having amde this recipe regularly, changing brands & whatnot, I've found that whole grain breadcrumbs are better than white (according to my palate).

This was an easy recipe and the chicken tasted good. Also, it was incredibly moist. It wasn't "crispy" on the outside, but the the flavor was nice.

Brought to a simple pot luck and it was gone in minutes! Very simple, very yummy.

I whisked oil into dipping liquid instead of drizzling it on. Fast, easy, moist and tasty.

Here is the trick...use Pioneer bread crumbs "very fine grain". Then make sure to use fresh lemon and fresh parmesan (makes all the difference). If you can (and like it) use dark meat chicken as it stays very moist.

At less than 25% fat, this dish doesn't need to be 'rounded out' with steamed or microwaved veggies, particularly since you can't absorb vitamin A without fat (it's one of the 4 fat soluble vitamins). Try quickly stirfrying the sweet potato instead, in olive oil with either some oregano or rosemary to retain the italian flavour implied by the parmesan in the recipe, or some sweet chilli sauce to bring out the paprika (sweet chilli goes particularly well with sweet potato). If you're really worried about your health, you'd do well giving the crumbed breasts a light spray with a healthy oil (like olive oil) even in addition to the drizzled oil, as this would result in a crispier texture, add more 'good fats' to your diet, while still remaining well below the recommend 30% of calories from fat.

Its great- but needs more bradcrumbs and cheese than the recipe calls for.

I highly suggest using extra virgin olive oil along with lemon juice, then cover with bread crumbs and dried herbs. It tastes great this way, although still not crunchy.

Rating: 2
Quite juicy and very easy but not as crispy as I hoped. I'll make it again if we want chicken, but not for a dinner party, if you know what I mean. Not bad, not incredible.

With due respect, many of the folks who rated this dish highly changed much of the recipe. Although I admit the lemony tang was pleasant, the dish overall was quite bland and boring. Perhaps adding some heat to the marinade or the breadcrumbs would improve the flavor, but as-is it's nothing to write home about.

I love the use of the lemon juice! I really wanted to cut out the egg and/or buttermilk dip before the coating. I skipped the lemon zest and I used panko instead of the breadcrumbs. I plan to use this same recipe for mild white fish as well with the lemon peel.

I didn't have lemon on hand, so I omitted it. I added garlic powder and pepper. I soaked the chicken in milk with cajun seasoning before dredging in the breadcrumbs. Turned out very well. I like to taste the chicken not all the extra.

I really like this recipe. However, rather than drizzling the olive oil on the chicken, I mixed it with the breadcrumb mixture (an idea taken from another recipe). Tasty, moist, and now a regular.

I'm rating this 4 forks - because it's "beyond compare" in ease of preparation - and good. I made it for family members with dietary limitations (left out the parmesan cheese but will try it next time). I was frankly skeptical - thinking it would probably be dry and tasteless and was amazed that it was tasty & moist. I used packaged unseasoned dry bread crumbs and added a bit of powdered chicken bouillon to them. I used *gasp* bottled lemon juice and omitted the lemon zest and drizzled them with more than just one TBL of olive oil - more like two. Oh - and I buttered the pan because I didn't have spray oil. Yes - I did use chicken - LOL! But I baked it for one hour instead of the suggested 1/2 hour -they were exceptionally large. In any case - undercooked chicken is unsafe. After one hour, it was still moist & tender. The point is that this basic recipe is highly adaptable, unbelievably easy and good - a real family recipe. It's also healthy. It will definitely become a staple in our house.

we loved this recipe! had to bake the chicken much longer than 25mins though. came out 'fried' and tasty!

I found this recipe easy to make and very good. My 11yr old daughter helped and thought is was easy enough too. I really like lemon and found it very good. My wife and 11yr old are not fond of lemon and didn't care for it too much. However I will make it again!

This was great - cooks up quickly with thin (or pounded) chicken breasts and a nice alternative to heavier, egg-based coating. The lemon flavor is surprising and tasty.

This dish was quick, easy and delicious. Using the 'thin' boneless chicken breasts the stores carry now, it cooked in about 25 minutes. Although the lemon zest added a nice touch in the coating, I omitted it the 2nd time I made it but still used the lemon juice for dipping and it was just as good.
