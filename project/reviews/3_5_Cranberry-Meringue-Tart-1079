I made this for my family for the first time this Christmas. I added chopped apples in addition to the cranberries which I also chopped after reading previous reviews. I topped the baked meringue with sifted powdered sugar. This dessert looks like a French dessert when it was ready for presentation. The dessert got rave reviews and was very tasty with the fruit. I would make this again.

one more thing- i ground the cranberries before adding them to the egg whites. i think otherwise would be way too tart.

the crust was very crumbly, and had to be pressed into the pan, rather than rolling out. the filling was very nice. good way to use up all those extra whites.

This is a recipe that turned out well, tasted good, but probably not something I need to make again. The tart was tart and sweet and very festive for the holidays, but based on its finished look, it didn't impress...which made it not such a hit at a company potluck. Of course, those who ate it gave great reviews, but that didn't help with those who didn't give it a try.

I'm not sure if I would make it again. The fault I found was my own - I made this in late winter and couldn't find cranberries. I used halved strawberries instead and found it to be too sweet. My husband liked it still and ate it all. I definitely think the tartness of cranberries is key.

I made two of these (one for practice)and everyone at work copied the recipe and vowed to make for Thanksgiving! The second one I made for book club was devoured instantly. A very good and wonderful treat. May try a different fruit next time, raspberries or grapes?

I made this in small tart pans as individual servings and it was still very good, but next time I will perhaps chop the cranberries in half.

While in Philadelphia several years ago, I had the opportunity to eat at Le-Bec Fin. It was one of the finest dining experiences ever. Recently they have come out with a cookbook which I have. It contains many wonderful dishes including the cranberry-meringue tart. I have make it twice. It makes a light desert that is very different and delicious.
