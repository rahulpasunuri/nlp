This recipe is clear as mud. One cannot saute something when it's in a soup. Saute first then combine. The ingredients called for seem approximately right though there needs to be at least triple the ginger. Revised version Blend first 11 ingredients and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper in processor until paste forms. Cook in a pot for around 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Cook till potatoes are nearly done. In a cast iron skillet, heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Sauté chicken. Add sauteed chicken to the pot and cook until chicken is done through.

Two things I would do differently next time. The sauce was too thin for me, so I ended up taking out the chicken and once the potatoes were cooked through, pureed the potato/tomato mixture to make a thicker sauce. I would also brown the chicken in the oil first, take out the chicken, then go on to the next step - the chicken was good, but I like the added texture and flavor of browning the chicken. Also, I added sriracha to kick it up!!

Awesome dish! I've made it many times for guests and they have said it's better than the restaurants' they have had. First some comments then cooking tips. Notes: This is a Balti style Vindaloo from England. Remember, England has a huge Indian and multicultural influence since they used to own half the world. Balti cooking has its own curry and uses, guess what? POTATOES! Who would have thought? If you go to S. Carolina and ask for BBQ it will be different than BBQ from Texas. Just b/c a recipe comes from a different region, background, or influence that you are not familiar with doesn't make it a "bad" recipe. BTW: Chicken Vindaloo is actually a Portuguese dish introduced to India by Portuguese settlers. So, so much for it being a "traditional" Indian dish anyway. Tips: This was awesome! 1)There is a bit too much water so scale it down or just let it cook off as I have done. But I would recommend the chicken broth as it adds more flavor. 2)Add some salt (I guess leaving it out was just an oversight). Salt & taste in layers - salt the veggies, taste, salt the chicken and potatoes, taste once the chicken is cooked through, add the broth and taste after a few minutes since it will have its own saltiness, then add more salt if you feel it needs it. 3)I have left out the cayenne and my 2-year-old loves this! I've also added more for a more 'adult' version.

My rating is based on my revised version of the recipe. Based on other reviews I tweaked this recipe quite a bit and it turned out delicious. It's an old recipe BTW from ten years ago so maybe Epicurious needs to get an updated version. My family is used to eating spicy Middle Eastern food, so keep that in mind if you want to follow what I did below: First I made my own garam masala (spices from an ethnic Pakistani or Indian shop are fresher and much cheaper). I then quadrupled the amounts of all the spices, and added garlic powder,a big TBS of Aleppo red pepper, cardamom, allspice and extra coriander. I then used 3 TBS of the mixture and added small amounts until the heat level was what I wanted. I also sauteed the onions and garlic with two chopped hot chili peppers before pureeing it all. After browning the chicken (10 boneless, skinless thighs, cut into pieces) I then added the "paste" and tomatoes to the broth. Instead of fresh or canned whole tomatoes, I added a large can of ground tomatoes. When I added the broth as called for in the original recipe it was pretty much the right consistency, not watery at all. No need for paste, and in fact I had to add a little water. I cooked the chicken for about 3o minutes then added small diced potatoes and cooked it all for another 30-45 minutes and adjusted the spices and added salt.

I seem to be in the minority here, but I love this recipe and have made it often. If you omit the potatoes, there are practically no carbs here either.

Not a good recipe at all. Combining of the ingredients left a lot to be desired when meal was fully cooked. Very bland and watery. sorry, but whose bright idea was it to add potatoes? It's rice, pilaf, or something else, not potatoes! Best recipe I found was from Jeff Smith's Immigrant Cooking. That one was full of rich, hot and savory taste. Took longer to prepare and cook, but it was well worth it. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

Rating: 2
Wish I had read the reviews before I made it, it probably would have turned out great. Instead it was pretty good with a lot of potential. The main complaint was that it was way too watery. Probably cutting the 1 1/2 cups down to 1/2 cup would have been a good start. I thought we cranked up the spices, but still it wasn't as spicy as I hoped. I liked the taste, but I don't think it tasted like it should.

HORRIBLE RECIPE! No excuse for this..there really isn't. If you're not experienced with mid-eastern cooking, it takes awhile to read a recipe and know whether it will be bad or good. This really is terrible..bland..watery..undercooked. You shouldn't have to totally redo a recipe - maybe a tweak here and there - but this one just needs to be deleted from the website. Don't waste your time.

Vindaloo is practically the only thing my husband ever orders when we get Indian food, because he loves it so much, and he thought this was an excellent version. I loved it because I thought it was very easy to make, and the ingredients are all things I usually have around. I followed the recipe exactly, except I replaced the cayenne pepper with a fresh serrano chile, and added some cauliflower florets along with the potatoes.

Made this recipe for New Year's Eve party. Added red bell pepper to the beginning puree, which I will not do again as the texture turned out tasty but not very smooth. Lovely flavor, not too spicy for wimps like me, incredibly easy to follow directions. Reheated beautifully. Served with basmati rice and naan, got many compliments from guests. Will definitely make again.

awful, do not follow by the book. bland and watery beyond belief.

Some recipes need to be followed to the letter, others are just an idea to get you started. This needs a few tweaks and it will be fine. First you need a chili paste for actual spiciness, if that's what you want. I used sambal olek (Indonesian, I know). Saute the garlic and onion first, I added in some chopped red bell pepper. Also I used just plain tomato sauce and my sauce was plenty thick without the paste. Left out the vinegar since the chili paste had some. Boiled the potatoes beforehand using a little chicken broth. I used baby red potatoes. Some things are just common sense; you should saute garlic and onions to bring out their flavor, you should not boil a chicken breast for 20 min, chili paste for real spice not powder. These are obvious flaws in the recipe.I hope this recipe hasn't discouraged anyone from trying other Indian recipes.

I was stubborn and wanted to try this recipe, even after I read all of the negative reviews. I took many suggestions from others (browning the onions and tomatoes before pureeing them, doubling the spices, using fewer potatoes) and thought the dish was ok. It needed a heavy dose of salt, and the chicken broth definitely added flavor. My fiancee, who has had authentic chicken vindaloo in Manhattan admitted that this doesn't taste like anything he gets at Indian restaurants. It lacked heat even though I added more cayenne. When I heated the leftovers today, I thought the dish didn't fare well, and I'm going to toss the rest of the leftovers. I will definitely not repeat this. I should have followed the reviews and just skipping trying this altogether.

even after 2 teaspoonfuls of cayenne, it was nowhere near as spicy as I hoped it would be and at one point I just gave up hope of ever getting there.

Overall this vindaloo recipe is one of the best online. It requires a lot of simple changes. I used 1/2 cup of broth and added shrimp instead of chicken. My husband and I like it spicy so we also added Siracha Asian sauce and ancho chile pepper and it was delightful. I also added a tablespoon of garam masala instead of a teaspoon.

Rating: 3
Recipe is off a bit, but came out awesome with some tinkering on my part. So, take 2 onions, only 3-4 potatoes (cut in to relatively small pieces)and one large chicken breast. Leave out the water completely at first (add only later if sauce too thick). Quadruple the Cayenne Pepper and throw in one or more thai red peppers(remember, this is a Vindaloo and not chicken Masala, damn it!!!). Add good amount of salt. If you do that, you essentially have enough to feed 2 people...well, I ate that portion myself. Anyways, can't understand some of the reviews on here. When you start making a dish (even if you have never made it before) and things seem to be a bit off while you prepare it (in this case, too much water, to many potates, too little cayenne pepper etc.), then improvise.Use some common sense ;)

The recipe was okay as far as spices. Definitely needed salt and could have used a good bit more heat. I'm sure doubling the spices would have worked well. The main problem came when the recipe tells you to add chicken and potatoes at the same time! The potatoes take soooo long to cook, that by the time they were cooked through, the chicken was dry and basically inedible. My advice is to cook the paste, add the potatoes, add the broth and let simmer for 20-30 minutes until the potatoes are soft (if you leave it uncovered, the sauce thickens), then toss in the chicken (crank up the heat to med/med-high) and saute the chicken for about 10min or until cooked. I would make it again, but only with major tweaks!

My family thought this recipe was just ok. Followed the recipe exactly and the flavors were there, but it was very thin and there was no heat. One person decribed it as Indian vegetable soup. Also needed salt. Would consider making again, now that I know the changes I would make, but will probably look around for a new recipe in the mean time.

Doubled the spices and it was still pretty bland...end result tasted mostly like a tomato curry sauce. The chicken curry w/ cashews on this site is a *LOT* better...

I agree with many of the comments here. Although the recipe smelled extremely spicy when it was cooking, the end taste was rather bland. I also don't know in what universe blending 3 cups of onions, 1 1/2 cups of tomatoes and all those spices was supposed to create a paste. Ours was definitely more of a puree that was lovingly described a "seasoned baby food". I agree with another reviewer who suggested browning the onions and tomatoes first. Then after the moisture cooks off, blend it up and maybe a paste will form, but I have my doubts. I find it interesting that no one mentioned anything about the potatoes. It took WAY longer than 15 minutes for them to become tender. It was more like 45 min. I'd say either cook them a little ahead of time or cut them into smaller pieces.

Rating: 2
It was pretty easy to prepare, however I needed to increase the spices to tablespoons rather than teaspoons to acheive a spicy flavor. Additionally, the potatoes took much long to cook than the chicken, making the chicken flavorless and tough. I would sear the chicken pieces to lock n the flavor, remove from the skillet and added back to the skillet near the end.

Its a great recipe if you double all the spices. I read the all the reviews and modified the recipe as necessary. I did spice it up even more by using my own recipe of garam masala & doubling the recommended amount.

What's great about vindaloo and curry in general is the intense flavor. This recipe had ZERO flavor. I am shocked that it got three forks. It needs much much more spice, and I don't just mean heat, but flavor in general. Although it also needs more heat.

Rating: 3
this dish was really good with at least 1 tsp. cayenne pepper. the spicyness is essential for authentic vindaloo. the vegetables and ginger can be thrown into the food processor in large chunks without any of the extra prep the recipe calls for. how easy it that! we'll definitely make this a regular.

Rating: 4
This dish is so easy to make if you have a food processor. Everyone has their own threshold of pain when it comes to spice, but I would say this is a 5 out of 10 for heat if you follow the recipe. Use a chicken base with a little water instead of broth. It seems to pull the flavors out better than broth. And it's great with warmed Naan!!

I give this recipe a review of excellent if made with the adaptations I used. I took the advice of previous reviews for some of these adaptations: First, I sauted the chopped onions and garlic in oil until the onions were translucent. Next, I seared the meat chunks in hot oil. For the meat ingredient, I used lamb instead of chicken (delicious!). Then, I pureed the onions and garlic (I used double the garlic.) with all of the other seasonings (doubled the ginger, cayenne, and garam masala) until smooth. At this point, I didn't cook the puree over hot oil but, instead, poured the puree into a bowl and stired in the lamb chunks and the raw potato chunks (cut into 1/2 inch cubes). I stired these together, covered the mixture, and placed it in the refrigerator for about 4-5 hours. Then, placing the mixture in a heavy- bottomed pot and adding 1 cup of water (instead of 1 1/2 cups) and 1 teaspoon of salt, I simmered the mixture--covered--for about 1 hour and then simmered it--uncovered- - for another 30 minutes. (It took at least an hour of simmering for the potatoes to be done.) At this point, I salted the dish to taste with about 1/2 teaspoon more salt. The dish was at a medium hot spice level, very tasty, and similar to restaurant versions I've had.

Rating: 3
I used bone-in, skin-on thighs and took the skin off before plating. I note that because it may have had an effect on the cooking (5+15+5 wasn't nearly enough to cook thru, and frankly the longer you cook it, the more flavorful the dish). I can see where making the paste then marinating the meat would enhance the flavor. The vinegar added a delightful brightness. Even without the potatoes and ginger, which I didn't have, this was a surprisingly good.

Rating: 4
So simple and so tasty ! I made it so many times. But a small advice for newbies: put only half the cayenne pepper in it cause it's really spicy (my housemates always complain about this :))

I took the advice of the cooks from NY, SFO and PDX  to double the spices, and cook the onion with some of the seasoning before adding the tomatoes. I also used the frozen potatoes. It was good; not great and probably not worth the effort this recipe calls for.

This was more like a tomato stew. I also found it had more liquid than expected. I used can tomatos with the juice. That may have been a factor. I'd also season the sauce with salt at the beginning.

I recalled chicken Vindaloo as being very hot, so added more cayenne at the end, and it was just right. The spice paste was more like a puree, and the end product had a little more liquid than expected, but otherwise met our expectations. Served it over coconut rice.

Delicious! Made it with pork, doubled the spices. Brown both the pork & onions and set aside. To the puree, while heating it up I added 1/4 cup or so plain yogurt which enriches the color and enhances flavour. Then I added the meat & onions and broth. Cover and simmer for approx 2 hours then add potatos (use very few, chopped in small cubes).Then simmer apprx 1 more hour. If not thickening, simmer uncovered for a while until it's at your desired consistency. Serve it over Basmati rice. Will definately make it again!

I agree with both the cooks from SFO and PDX - double the spices, and cook the onion with some of the seasoning before adding the tomatoes. Other than that, my advice is to let it cook for as long as possible, so the meat absorbs all of the incredible flavors. This dish goes amazingly with naan and raita. Definitely a winner.

Rating: 1
This recipe is flawed. It calls for processing onions, tomatoes and spices together before cooking, without any browning of onions. The result lacks complexity. Likely better to brown onions before processing. (Hinted in body of recipe when it says to cook til golden--impossible with the tomatoes mixed in.)

Rating: 4
Let me tell you how to rock this recipe, because it is absolutely DELICIOUS! Use about 1 and half times the spices (maybe a little more cayenne cause it should be spicy), more tomato paste, more stock and a few dashes of salt. Cook a little longer until it reduces, and the potatoes start to incorporate into the sauce. This is an AWESOME recipe, just needs a little help. Do it like this, and I guarantee itll be a regular.

I love this recipe and make it often. I now have a weird variation in place of basmati rice to serve with the chicken vindaloo. Make a batch of spaetzle dough and add 1 tablespoon of garam masala to it. Cook the spaetzle according to directions and serve with this recipe. It really works out well. Spaetzle makers are inexpensive and is such a time saver. It's quicker than cooking the rice!

Rating: 3
Not bad for a vindaloo. I did not blend the spices first to make a paste as I prefer the garlic and ginger 'whole'. Also, used more tomatoes, added two finely chopped green chillies (for more pazzaz) and fresh coriander as well as the powdered stuff. Tasted much better after two days in the fridge.

I've made this with chicken and we do like it, but it is totally beyond compare made with pork! Cube the same amount of a cheap cut of pork and follow the directions except instead of stove-top cooking put the curry in a casserole and bake at 350 for 2 hours. Can be made a day in advance and reheated. It is delicious and authentic according to my friend from Goa.

I did not follow the instructions but used my crock pot and it was delicious. I used 2 lbs chicken breast, sliced, 2 cups onion, lime juice instead of vinegar, tripled(at least) the garlic, doubled the ginger and tomato paste, 1 tsp sea salt, and used water, not broth. chopped the onion, minced garlic and ginger, and put all ingredients in the crock pot (except potatoes, which I did not use just because I didn't have any). Cook on high for 2 hours, low for one, add zucchini, carrot, and red pepper, cook for one more hour on low. Served over Indian spiced rice or couscous. I love to use my crock pot for chicken and this recipe works superbly. I will definately make this again!!

Unfortunately, I had already purchased the ingredients before reading the reviews. Doubling the seasoning helps, but there's scant fat and not a lot of taste. Perhaps plain yogurt or clarified butter would help or a richer oil than the canola I used. It's more a soup than a stew.

I took the suggestions of others and doubled the spices, garlic, and ginger. I also added a habanero... but I think that was a mistake. There is such a thing as too spicy... I want to be able to take in all the flavors. Next time I might increas the amount vinegar and lower that of the chicken broth (in fact, I'm not convinced it's even absolutely necessary here).

This turned out really well, although I doubt it would have had I not read all of the reviews prior to making it. I doubled the garlic, ginger, all spices, added 2 fresh chopped green jalapenos, and added 2 tsp salt. I used boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces. I decreased the onion (just chopped 2 onions) and used onion-flavored pre cubed potatoes from the dairy aisle - great suggestion from another cook. I cooked the potatoes until almost mushy. I made this the night before I served it, which melded the flavors, and I was happy with the leftovers. I served it with cabbage slaw with a cumin-lime vinaigrette to cut down the heat. My guests loved the meal!

This recipe was okay, but was not nearly as flavorful as I had expected, even after adding extra ginger, garlic, and cayenne. With all that went into the sauce, and how good it smelled when it was cooking, I thought it would be fabulous. I served it with mango chutney, which helped enhance the flavor a bit.

I'd say this is a pretty authentic vindaloo. I made mine with pork (even more authentic). I also added curry leaves and black mustard seeds and doubled the amount of ginger. Apart from that I marinated the pork in the spice mixture for three hours. I sprinkled the finished dish with chopped cilantro.

This is a good start for what can be a pretty good vindaloo. The cooking times and some of the descriptions are off. The paste does not become golden and the potatoes and chicken benefit from a longer cooking time. I upped the spices (especially the ginger and garlic) and finished the dish with yogurt and green peas.

The recipe by itself was rather bland, but with some extra spice, and the side of Indian flat bread, it turned out very well. I combined the ingredients of this recipe with the cooking style of other vindaloo recipes. Made the onion paste separate, the ginger/garlic paste separate, them cooked all together, and added extra spice at the end. I will have to tinker a bit more, but I'd make it again. Time consuming, but worth the experience.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe 3 times and each time it improves. The potatoes seem to be a problem with the cooking time. I bought pre-cooked cubed potatoes in the produce refrigerated section of the supermarket and not only did it cut down on time, but it was great. I'm now using those precooked potatoes for all recipes that call for potatoes cooked in the dish you're making. What a time saver and they taste good. My suggestion for all of you who had problems with this recipe, try it again using the pre-cooked potatoes.

Rating: 2
It was OK but nothing like what I had expected. The fast preparation (compared to other Vindaloo recipes) was a plus. I used boneless chicken breasts, extra garlic and cayenne. The sauce/onion paste had too much tomato (and never developed the carmelized/browned onion flavor I had hoped for) and the potatoes took quite a bit longer to cook than specified. Next time, I would cut the potatoes much smaller, and reduce (or even eliminate) the diced tomatoes. I haven't given up on this recipe, but it needs some work.

Until I can figure out what else to put in it (something with color, texture, etc.) I won't be making it again - to the relief of my roommate.

On a recent trip to Canada, I tried the Chicken Vindaloo at Earl's restaurant in Jasper and it was delicious. When I saw this recipe, I was so excited to try it, but it just didn't cut it flavor-wise. Despite all the seasonings, the sauce was not as flavorful as the restaurant-version and wasn't worth the time it took to make it. Overall, a big disappointment.

Very tasty recipe.....brought back memories of a prawn vindaloo I had in San Francisco. I recommend making the paste a few hours in advance so the flavors can meld together. Also the potatoes took a little bit longer to cook and I used boneless chicken breasts. Will definitely make again
