Doubled and served at a women's card party. It was very well received. Excellent choice when you want to serve something out of the ordinary.

For a family dinner we doubled this recipe, served it with baby arugula in lieu of watercress, and got great reviews. It is very light and the flavors are complementary.

This dish received mixed reviews at my house. I used baby arugula instead of watercress, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was a great summer salad: light but flavorful. This is probably because I love fennel, especially the combo of fennel and orange. My husband, on the other hand, hated it. The two forks reflect the average of our ratings: 3 forks and 1 fork.
