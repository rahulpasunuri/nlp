I'm rating this 3 forks only because of the suggestion to leave bones in! If this is supposed to be in the tradition of Argentinean Milanesa NO BONES should be attached! Use a very thin and lean cut of meat such as veal scaloppine. The breading procedure is 100% correct. If you bread and leave the steaks in the regfrigerator overnight you will get a better, crispier crust when you sautee. Make sure you don't sautee over too low heat. It needs a slightly higher temp to brown. Also I add salt and pepper plus a few dashes of garlic powder and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. It makes the crust very tasty and firecrackery. A kids' favorite with mashed potatoes!

I used thin steaks from our local Food Lion that said "Milanesa" on the package, so there was no bone. This was delicious, and reminded me of what I ate when I went to Argentina while in college. I am looking forward to trying the various hints and tips offered by other reviewers (e.g., putting in the refrigerator before frying to make sure the coating sticks; adding parsley to the egg mix, etc.) Thanks to whoever posted this recipe!

Maybe on the bone tastes better, but I've been eating these in Argentina my whole life and have NEVER eaten one cooked on the bone. Not in a restaurant and not in a home. It is true that parsley is often added as well. One can also dredge in breadcrumbs before the egg (which makes the egg stick better) and then in crumbs again. A tip to make sure the coating sticks better is to refrigerate (at least 1 hour to 1 day) the prepared milanesas before frying them.

..on the bone is correct. After once having it served this way, I always use bone-in chops for my veal parmesean, too. The chops should just have the one long bone attached like a lollypop. Lightly pound around the bone. I season the chops and dust w/flour then double crumb with egg and crumbs. There is always extra flavor when things are cooked on-the-bone. This is a simple and tasty dish for friends and/or family. Food, glorious food!

I believe that this is the correct recipe. It is purely for aesthetics though. In all good restaurants the bone is left in and presented that way enveloping the plate. You just pound out the meat obviously not the bone.

The remark made by the NJ cook is correct. I´m Argentinian and she is right, the bones should not be attached. Because tendering the meat turns out an impossible task. There must have been a translation missinterpretation. Even though I suggest to preparing this dish adding finely chopped pasley to the egg mix.It´s delicious

Actually you are meant to pound the meat around the bone, leaving the bone intact and attached. I would also use Panko bread crumbs instead of regular.

Haven't made this yet although it sounds good. Instructions aren't clear, however. On the ingredient list it specifies VEAL CHOPS WITH BONES ATTACHED. In instructions, it says to pound the cutlets. One can't pound veal chops with bones. What is the correct procedure?
