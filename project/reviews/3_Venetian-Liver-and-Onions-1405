Fantastic version. Go heavy on the sage - closest thing I've ever tasted (at home) to the famous liver served at Il Cantinori on Tenth Street in NYC.

We all liked this - even the non-liver-likers. The mushroom-Madeira dish goes very well with this as well as potato-parsnip mashed. I found that there was not enough flour, so make extra.

My favorite recipe for liver by far. Wonderful, decadent flavor.

Very good. A nice simple change to the usual liver and onions.
