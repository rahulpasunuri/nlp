Easy to make and very healthy! I used sweet potato instead of russet because that's what I had. Delicious!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out wonderful! The broth was rich in flavor and the amount of vegetables gave the soup good texture and heartness.

This a a great recipe when you're short on time.. Great as is - if you want to 'doctor it up' do what I did... Add tomatoes w\chilies (one can) and one can regular. I added some dry vermouth instead of another bottle of clam broth.

I would highly recommend adding a large carrot and some chopped sweet red pepper. While sauteing add some white wine. I omitted the chilies this time around.

Not only do we enjoy this recipe, we gave the ingredients in a gift basket with a bottle of wine.

I've made this recipe many times. I double the clam juice and either use 3 to 4 cans chopped clams or add fresh clams. Instead of green chilis, I use one can of stewed tomatoes with chiles, the other regular. Lastly, I add a bit of Old Bay Seasoning instead of salt to finish.

First off i would give this 3 1/2 forks The soup taste great and it was like a no brainer to make. the only minor changes i made was pancetta instead of bacon, and i used tomato's stewed w/ green chili's instead of adding them in. Also i had no thyme on hand so i just added some sage.

I have been looking for a good manhattan chowder recipe for awhile now and this is it! I even added a bit more heat to it with Tobasco. Otherwise, I would not change a THING! A thick hearty soup great for cold nights!

I don't eat pork, so I substituted a tin of anchovies for the bacon. First, I poured the oil from the tin in the pot(since you're losing the bacon fat). Then I chopped the anchovies and threw them in with the first round of ingredients -- you don't need to heat them up like the bacon since they're already prepared. For a soupier soup I doubled the tomato sauce and clam juice. I prepared this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.

Loved the flavors in this recipe. I used a low-salt bacon. Then sauteed mirapoix (the holy trilogy... celery, carrots and onion) and then the rest of the ingredients. The chilies were a nice touch too. I added more clams and potato because we like our soup(s) less brothy. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I love it! Was easier to make than New England style. I used fresh tyme and a little bit chili peppers instead.

Very good. I did not find this spicy as green chilies are mild. I added white wine which was a nice touch. This is a nice change from New England chowder.

Left ut the chilies just because I didn"t have them on hand. My husband liked this receipe so that's the reason I would make it agan. I thought it was a bit too tomatoey in order to taste the other ingredients.

I thought it was excellent. I didn't change any of the ingredients except I used apple-smoked bacon, which was a little too strong. I love spicy food, and didn't find it spicy at all. Maybe the cook from Blackstone used the wrong kind of chilis?

Wonderful recipe, favor over New England clam chowder by far. Served it to guest, got rave review for it. Is a great recipe due to your being able to add or delete ingredients as desired.

This chowder does not need any green chilies. At my cookout for 25 yesterday, only those who like hot mexican food liked the sweat of the chilies. The majority said it was too hot. Especially not suitable for older people with bland palates. Leave out the chilies and everything else works together well, without the heat.

it's all good! best clam chowder recipe I ever done had. i makes my wife cook it for me all the time (she is a cheerleader).

I left out the bacon and didn't miss it. This was a nice hearty soup and full of flavor. I used canned tomatoes with green chilies as many others did - soup had plenty of zip so I'm glad I stayed on the cautious side with the chilies. Good easy weeknight meal!

We have never before tried Manhattan style clam chowder. Boy, were we impressed. My son likes this recipe better than New England clam chowder and he likes the former alot. I did double the potatoes, but otherwise, I followed the recipe. It reheats great, too.

This recipe produced a very hearty chowder. I multiplied the recipe by 1.5. Used fresh thyme and also added Old Bay Seasoning in place of the salt. The green peppers though mild, added a nice flavor. I waited until the last 20 minutes before adding the potatoes. Served with franchese bread, a simple salad of baby greens, and a chilled glass of chardonnay. Comfort food for a cold fall night.

This was a little bland until I added 2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, and 2 tsp Fish Seasoning (a mix) and then it really sprang to life! Wonderful, or even better. I used the Ortega diced green chilis, as they aren't hot, but just add flavor. This is a definite keeper.

Being a "new england" clam chowder fan, I was totally surprised how good this chowder was. I, too, used diced tomatoes with chilies rather than the separate can of chilies. I also added another potato and dried oregano. Yummy and very satisfying.

I'm not a fan of tomato based soups/stews of any kind, made it for my husband and had a very pleasant surprise. I used home canned tomatoes and was out of celery so used celery seed, would definately use it again.

I, too, was skepitcal about the green chilies; therefore, I purchased stewed tomatoes with green chilies rather than add the amount listed. The result was delicious! This is an easy, quick soup to make even for a novice cook. I'll definitely make this again.

I was kinda leery about the green chiles, not knowing if all of my guests would like it that hot, so I used half of the recipe for the chiles. It was fantastic. Everyone loved it.

I doubled the recipe, but it was excellent. It will become a regular in the dinner rotation!
