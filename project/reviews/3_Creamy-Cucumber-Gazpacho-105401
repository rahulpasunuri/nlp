i found to be too sour. watch the amount of lime juice, put in 2 tablespoons and taste before adding the rest . if i made it again i would puree all of the bell peppers, and chiles instead of only half.

Everyone loved this! I used 2 whole jalapenos, 2 garlic cloves, 4 tbsp lime juice, and about 1/3 cup cilantro. I also subbed whole-milk yogurt for the sour cream. The soup didn't taste too great when I first tried it, but after 2 hours in the fridge it was fabulous!

To chill, I placed a covered bowl in the freezer's ice tray for 10 minutes. This worked much better than the ice and water bath.

I left out the cilantro and added 3 basil leaves and a few chives... used a little less sour cream and 1 yellow pepper and 3/4 jap. Love it!

The other reviwer was right. This recipe is just missing something. I'd stick with traditional gazpacho.

took this up on the mountain and relished it

I didn't think this was bland at all! In fact, my tastebuds are still burning from the jalapeno! My only alterations were cutting back on the cilantro by about half (I'm not a huge fan of it), using only 1 jalapeno and 1 yellow pepper, using a box of firm silken tofu in place of the sour cream, and white pepper in place of the black (I'm allergic). It got rave reviews. I will definitely be making this again.

In the future, I'd substitute plain yogurt for sour cream. I added white pepper, chives, and scallions to spice up. I'm a big cucumber soup fan and this was easier than my usual chicken-broth based recipe.

I made this according to the recipe with the exception of adding 2 small jalapenos. I thought it was just right and not too hot or spicy. It tastes even better the next day. It was great for a hot summer night. Enjoy!

I made this soup last night. It sounded great, but I found it to be very bland and missing something. I'll stick with regular gazpacho next time.
