This is now my go-to gazpacho recipe. The roasted vegetables give this a beautiful flavor that other gazpacho recipes just can't match. I've served it warm, at room temperature, chilled, at the beach and on a cold winter night. Everyone loves it. I wouldn't change a thing...except to caution you to make plenty!

Too bad there wasn't an option to rate this 5 forks! I've made this 3 times and did use the roasted garlic (added to the onions about halfway through the cooking.) As far as taste one MUST use GOOD tasting tomatoes! Mine were from my own garden so were at peak of ripeness. Call it gazpacho or not, I don't care it is great. Extra water can be used, I did up to another cup with very good results. Please do not rate a recipe you have not tried, it's not helpful.

I have tried several gazpacho recipes and had a favorite until I tried this one. I loved the clean taste - and think the roasting and the red peppers are a greast addition. I will add garllic the next time (which is actually today) The sherry vinegar is a must - adds almost a mysterious taste.

This recipe was great. I added 5-6 cloves of garlic to the onion-pepper mixture before roasting. Also, used 3 tsp. instead of one of the hot sauce. Finally, my soup required 3 cups of water at the end

This ia a great way to use those ripening tomatoes from the garden.

This was wonderful. So flavorful. I roasted all of the vegetables including whole jalapenos, onions and garlic together. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden. I also used fresh corn with the cucumbers as a garnish. My guests loved it and my husband said it was the best he'd ever had!

Since I have never particularly cared for gazpacho, I ignored this recipe in last month's magazine. Had it not been for a co-worker making it, I would have missed out on a really terrific recipe! Maybe I'm not the person to rate gazpachos, but I thought it was sensuously rich--has terrific umami (mouth feel). I've made it twice now. My neighbors loved it when they tried it, and a friend and I jointly cooked a gourmet dinner for 15 people. We served this as one of the courses, and everyone really liked it. As far as I'm concerned, it's definitely a keeper. I intend to make it a permanent part of my summer repertoire.

adds the right amount of specialness to an overworked food. i.e., no one could guess what made this taste slightly out of the ordinary. I did add a clove of garlic to it.

How you can call something like this gazpacho is beyond me. As for the other cook from Boston, gazpacho is NOT a mexican, spicy dish. it is spanish, mild, and full of a garlic aroma, without being overpowering. Also, there is no roasting involved. Its a summer soup, ideal for unbearably hot weather. Try http://al-andalus.com/gazpa.htm for the real thing, and add some day-old bread, crumbled, for a Sevillian flavor.

As others have said, this recipe definitely needed something. I combined another gazpacho recipe I have with this one with good results. Try adding some finely chopped red onion, garlic and cilantro to taste. For more tang, also try adding either lemon or lime juice to taste.

We made this recipe as soon as we got our issue of Bon Appetit. I was extremely disappointed with the results. Like another reviewer said, we added salt to give it some flavor. Next time, we agreed we would definitely try adding more hot sauce. It just seemed like it was lacking something. . .

Very easy and good. The roasted vegetables brought out the flavors. My company loved it and ask for the recipe. I added a touch more of the hot pepper sauce. The amount of water that you use depends on how meaty the tomatoes and peppers are. Will make it many more times.

This was really easy to make and my guests loved it. About half actually asked for seconds. I needed to do the pureeing in 3 batches, not 2 so I apportioned the water accordingly. It was the easiest gazpacho I ever made. Try it.

Anticipation was high as I savored the glorious smell of the roasted vegetables emanating from my oven. Unfortunately, the final product was blan beyond belief. Extra seasoning failed to make this recipe a keeper for me.

This soup was good, but not great. It tasted more like tomato sauce than gazpacho and I needed to add a lot of salt to make it flavorful.
