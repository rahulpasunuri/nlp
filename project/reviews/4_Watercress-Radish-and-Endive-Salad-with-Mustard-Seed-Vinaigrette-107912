Wonderful salad. I used an apple instead of the radishes, which was delicious and countered the bitterness. I also didn't have mustard seed, so just used whole grain mustard. It was very well received!

This recipe was really very good. I love watercress and was looking for a good salad recipe. This is one I will definately make again!

This was delicious but just a bit too subtle to be a WOW. VERY easy to make... My first batch of dressing seemed overwhelmed by the lemon, but I was able to quickly make a second batch with 3/4 of a tablespoon of lemon juice and slightly more olive oil and it was a quite elegant flavor. Also, I found it only took 1-2 minutes to get the mustard seeds to pop... I will definitely make this again, though I might try the version that uses toasted walnuts and cranberries instead of the radishes for a little more color and contrast of flavors...

Fantastic, unique, delicious and easy to make. Everyone loved it! I cut my redishes on a mandolin and served the salad on Asian dishes with chop-sticks

This salad was wonderful. Guests ate every last bite. The dressing has a light, refreshing flavour to it. Definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe on at least three separate occasions. It is simple yet also has a lot of character. I brought it to a dinner party and received nothing but raves. Give it a try - it is unique and delicious.
