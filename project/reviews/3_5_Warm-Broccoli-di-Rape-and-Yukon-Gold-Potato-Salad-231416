Delicious and easy combination. I seasoned more genreously than she recommends but as a side to pan-fried filet mignon, it was excellent -- and leftovers the next day were perfect as a salad. Just warmed it in the microwave and sprinkled w/fresh grated parmigiano reggiano.

VERY GOOD I WILL MAKE AGAIN. FOR A CHANGE OF PACE TRY A SPLASH OF WINE VINEGAR ON IT.
