I just had to make this recipe from the moment I saw it, finding the combination of ingredients simply irresistible. Having indulged the craving, I find it does indeed make a tasty dessert. However, I found the crust problematic. The bottom crust was overly browned by the time the lattice was baked. Next time I will shorten its initial time in the oven. Also, the freezing and cutting of the lattice layers proved messy and ineffective. Advise from future bakers would be appreciated. I would love to get this to look as good as it tastes.

Although it was a challenging recipe, this pie was worth the effort! I couldn't find red currant jam, so I used traditional raspberry jame--it was delicious! The almonds, which are the central ingredient in the dough, made this recipe great. Next time, I may try to sprinkle powdered sugar on it, or put a layer of Lindt chocolate sauce underneath the jam.
