Way too sweet.

The pudding itself was amazing! I made the dried cranberry compote but together it seemed like too many flavours. I ate the rest of the cranberry compote with plain yogurt and that was great! The pudding would be delicious without the cardamom and orange peel if you feel like something simpler.

Wow. I typically dislike white chocolate, but this was AMAZING. Very rich, smooth, and interesting. Careful of adding too much white chocolate...I did and it was a bit too rich, btu I think it may have been that my scale was off. Will make again and again!

We thought this was fabulous. My husband - who doesn't care for rice pudding, asked me to keep the recipe. I didn't care for the cranberry compote, so next time I will substitute with the cherry sauce in RICE PUDDING WITH ALMONDS AND CHERRY SAUCE (this website), which is wonderful.

I have never had a problem with this recipe and have made it many times. It is rich but the cranberries cut the richness and is a great combination. The cardamom is a must!

I made this several years ago and I quite enjoyed it. I actually forgot about it until I came across the recipe today while searching for another recipe. When I made it, I left out the orange peel and cardamom.

Didn't really like the rice pudding but the cranberry compote was pretty good.
