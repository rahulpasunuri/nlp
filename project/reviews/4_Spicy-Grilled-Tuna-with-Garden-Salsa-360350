Wonderful. I doubled the recipe, except I used 1 (ONE) jalapeno with 1 seed. It took longer to get the garlic and jalapena grilled to soft. We like peppers, but prefer to feature the Tuna. And I settled for Whole Foods beefsteak tomatoes and it was still wonderful. I had garden fresh mint and basil, and probably was a bit heavy handed with the herbs.

I've made this recipe on 3 occasions and it was fantastic every time. Although I made it the same way each time, the heat level was different for all 3. Once it was incredibly spicy, and once it was very mild. So I think the quality of the jalapenos has a lot to do with the final result. Next time I make this I'm going to double the salsa recipe. It's delicious and there's never enough!

It was very tasty. I am at a friend's house, so I didn't have a food processor, I just mashed up the pepper with the garlic and lime juice. But let me tell you, I put maybe 10 seeds in and it was hot!!! Maybe the meat absorbs some of the "kick" when you grill it on the stove. It was still really good, although I could have used a carb with it!! LOL!!

Loved the marinate and the salsa. Both would work with with a variety of seafood. Does get a bit of a kick, so watch how many seeds from the jalapenos go into the mix.

Great flavor, but unless you like it REALLY spicy be sure to remove the seeds from the jalapenos before blending.

Hi, I have been a chef/owner for 4o years. What's up with this disgusting picture of a perfectly fine tuna. Why does it have to be "burned". Teach them how to grill. A turn-off, disappointed, Peter Schott

Delicious~ I used combination of jalapeno and serrano chilies from our garden. I had to double the recipe for the salsa base so there would be enough to coat the tuna and add to the tomato mixture - and that was for two of us. We had salsa left over though, which was just fine - quite yummy!

Remarkably good! The recipe definitely should read "half of the mixture" instead of 1/2 cup. We used mahi mahi steaks instead of tuna. I was skeptical about the relative sweetness of the heirloom tomatoes combined with the mint called for, but the salsa's flavors blended beautifully and made for a lovely, fresh topping for the fish.

ONe note. It says 1/2 cup, i think that should read 1/2 the volume.

Terrific reciepe. 5 weight watcher points. 30-45 minutes from stove/grill to table. Very easy, very good. this would also make a great salsa. I think you could substitue chicken for tuna and that would work to. I marinated for more like 2 hours and I think that deepened the flavors.

Wow, this was terrific! I was skeptical: salsa and tuna? But the salsa is light and the herbs make it delicate enough to be a perfect match with the tuna. Bayless's cooking guide for the tuna was right on, too. This will be a new summer standard in my house: easy and delicious!
