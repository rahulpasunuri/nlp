I bought a breast with bone and skin. Took the meat off the bone, seasoned it, placed the breast halves together so that it was a uniform thickness, then wrapped the whole thing in the skin. Trussed and roasted, this was delicious. I used fresh herbs and added some apple pieces to the veggies. What a beautiful presentation and the gravy has a wonderful acidic tang from the dry wine. A little bit of effort produced a Thanksgiving tradition.

We left ourselves too little time one Sunday night to prepare a planned stuffed turkey breast, and made this instead. What a find! It would be a perfect Thanksgiving dinner for guests who want to avoid a gut-bomb. We used one whole boneless turkey breast. We reduced the amount of wine to one cup. Baking time was less than an hour. After straining the pan juices, we pureed about a third of the vegetable mixture in a food processor and added it to the gravy together with about a cup of additional stock. We didn't de-fat the pan juices. We thickened the gravy with a slurry of flour and water rather than a roux. The turkey was moist and the gravy delicious. We served it with smashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and cornbread.

This was a weeknight dinner using a split breast with rib bones (3 lbs.) It only took an hour in the oven. I didn't have time to let the herbs sit in oil for an hour, so I pureed fresh herbs and garlic in the oil and used it right away - rubbing the oil and herbs under the skin. It was terrific! I had to go out unexpectedly so I never basted at all. It was still great. Don't skip the chopped onions, etc - they flavor the juices and also act as a sort of rack to lift the meat above the liquid. I skipped the gravy but I recommend using the turkey fat instead of butter if you make it.

I used a 5 1/2 pound turkey breast w/bone. I cut the spices & liquid in half - omitted the carrots/celery & onions. The turkey was fragrant - tender & very juicy. I slow baked it for 4 hours (300 degrees) covered in foil. The turkey fell off the bone literally. My guests liked it and took the recipe with her. Rather than make the gravy I am going to make the leftovers into turkey & noodles using the juices. Yummy!

This has been our family's favorite turkey recipe since it appeared in the November, 1994 issue. And each time I fix it for friends they request the recipe. However I have never fixed it with boned or cut-up turkey. I use a whole 14-15 lb. turkey or a whole bone-in turkey breast. My grocery store often sells a half turkey which lays very nicely on top of the chopped vegetables. I have even added slices of citrus or other fruits to the chopped vegtables. This adds another interesting layer of flavor to the sauce.

This was fantastic. I had some trouble with the turkey - the guys at the butcher counter didn't take all the bones out of the legs so I ended up just cooking the white meat. Next time, I'll just buy a boned turkey breast or two. The cooked meat was very moist and the flavor fantastic.

This was a fair amount of effort(I took the bones out of the turkey myself) for what I thought was a just "OK" result. It did smell wonderful while it was baking, but I thought it was bland and the sauce not that great. Maybe I did something wrong (?) - go figger...

This recipe is fabulous. Moist, delicious, easy. Presented beautifully as it sliced perfectly. All my friends thought I was nuts to bone a turkey, but I was sitting with my family 15 minutes after clearing the table instead of taking care of a carcass!

This recipe has become a favorite for our family. I have used it with whole turkey and turkey breast. I kept the amounts the same for all. I also have added fruits(orange and pear) to the vegetable mixture. The sauce or gravy is unique in flavor and consistency.

This was quite delicious and I would definitely make this again. I found that a key to this recipe is basting the turkey alot during cooking as the recipe didn't call for the turkey to be covered. I scaled the recipe down as I was cooking 2 turkey breasts which I had tied together and they only weighed in at about 5 lbs.

I made this using part sherry because I ran out of chardonnay. I didn't serve it that night. The next day I put everything in a huge casserole & covered it with a purchased pie shell, pieced together to fit. Excellent pot pie!

This recipe is a great substitute for traditional pot roast dinners for non-beef-eaters like us. It was simple and delicious, and it got rave reviews from my family. We didn't cook a whole turkey either, just a breast, but it the flavors weren't compromised in any way. Enjoy!

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition at our home. I do, however, use a whole turkey and it works out great. This year I am going to try injecting some of the liquid directly into the meat to increase the moistness even more. A real winner!

I've been making this since the recipe was first published. It's one of my ultimate favorites and a real hit at my casa. I butcher the turkey, bundle up the thighs and make the stock with the bones the night before. It makes for great convenience. The meat is always flavorful and moist. I'm thinking of adding fennel to the vegetables this year.

Let me start by saying, "Wow"! This recipe turned out to be so much more than I thought! I used fresh herbs and for sure that made a difference. We prefer dark meat so I used 4 turkey thighs. I brushed apprx. 1 teaspoon of the marinade onto the inside of each thigh before rolling into loaves. The veggies I cut into 1" pieces and tossed with a little of the marinade, salt, and pepper. I substituted chenin blanc for the wine and thought that the sweetness lent a very nice flavor to the sauce. After removing the liquid needed for the sauce, it seemed a shame to discard the veggies so I continued to roast them until they were slightly carmelized and when serving I used them as a bed for the slices of turkey. I served with a side of your basic mashed potatoes. With more attention to the accompanying side dishes and garnishes, this simple meal can transcend into a dinner fit for guests!

Instead of chopping the veggies I julienned them and then served them with the turkey.
