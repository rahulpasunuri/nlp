I made several flavors of banana bread at the same time as this one- banana pecan & strawberry walnut. This one was by far the favorite! I used one larger loaf pan instead of the smaller ones. I suggest using unsweetened coconut.

Very bland. Regret wasting the macadamia nuts to use in this recipe.

This is also listed as Coconut Macadamia Nut Banana Bread - Oct. '91 and has a ton of reviews. It seems everyone agrees this is a great recipe as a jumping off point for a great loaf of BB. It must be that the wet ingredients are perfectly porportioned to the dry ones. The addition of sour cream makes it so moist and one reviewer substituted that for mascarpone with success. I only added cinnamon and nutmeg because honestly, what is BB without cinnamon?! Total baking time in a 10 inch loaf pan, because it's the only pan I can bake BB in without getting a raw middle, was 55 min. which is about right for single loaf BB recipes. The rest of the batter went into lined muffin tins for 35 minutes and had to be one of the best muffins I've made in 20 years of baking! Don't be daunted if you don't have the exact ingredients. Improvise. This is a great recipe to do it with!

This is really not banana bread! My husband, a great fan of banana bread, and I were v. disappointed! While the coconut and macadamia make it more interesting, it s essentailly a cake with a little banana flavour. The recipe should be renamed. Not for banana bread aficionados!

this bread is amazing. i made a few changes though. use all brown sugar. omit 1/2c. flour with ground oatmeal or wheat germ. use six bananas instead of three and cook them down in the butter over medium heat so the butter infuses and gets a nutty flavor. instead of using nuts and coconut i melted down 1c. of semisweet chocolate and added it in layers with the batter. it produces a dense chocolate banana bread. amazing!

GREAT Banana Bread. I am always looking for a recipe to compare to Grandma's. I plan on sending her this one. I didn't have 5 mini loaf pan so I made Muffins. I also left out the Lemon Zest. I will recommend this to my friends
