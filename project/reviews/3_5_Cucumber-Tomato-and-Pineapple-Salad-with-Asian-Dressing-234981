This is an amazingly good-tasting salad, featuring a sweet-sour-salty- hot combo. I followed the directions, with these alterations (mostly at the suggestion of other reviewers): used regular cucumbers without seeding, added a bit more mint and lime juice than called for; subbed parsley for the cilantro, added 1/2 thinly sliced red onion, added a scant teaspoon of sesame oil, and served the minced jalapenos on the side. Everybody in our co-ed book club loved it.

This salad is so so so good. I made it weekly for about a month and no one ever complained - you just don't get sick of eating it! I also tried it with watermelon instead of pineapple, amazing. The only issue is the leftovers get a little soggy if you dress it all at once, but it still tastes great.

Really good. I served it with grilled shrimp; it would also be good with a crispy slow-roasted pork shoulder or ribs. I added cantaloupe and red bell peppers since I had them coming out of my ears. Next time I'll omit the tomato; its subtle flavor was lost and I found that the crisper textures were the best bites.

Easy and addictive. I like it for dinner over rice. It's really good that way.

Love this salad! It's beautiful and so delicious. I'm not a fan of mint so I don't include it, and there's still plenty of flavor.

Really tasty. Made it for a party and everyone loved it. It's a keeper for us and a great one for when the cucumbers and tomatoes are ready for harvesting.

This salad was fantastic! I added a little sesame oil and used a BIG jalepeno pepper, seeds and all. (I did seed the tomatoes though). I can't wait to make this again with melon. I think anything sweet and juicy would be fantastic!

I served this with Easter dinner and there were very few leftovers. I used the whole cucumber and used more tomato. Delicious.

I don't get the whiners who can't figure out how to make the dressing tastier. Drain the veggies. Reduce the pineapple juice if you have any. Taste the dressing - it should be strong. Make it the way you like, then dress the salad. Adding sesame seeds and using sesame oil was also a great idea. It was good!

I made this for a party and it was definitely a huge hit. Everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe. It's pretty and extremely tasty too. The combination of the sweet, cool and spicy was awesome!

I made this as called for and didn't feel it was anything to get excited about. It definitely would benefit with more heat and some pineapple juice concentrate- or some lime juice.

I made this salad on a very hot summer night and it was perfect. I chilled the cucumber, ripened tomatoes, and pineapple and it was super refreshing! To make the salad a main course, I added chilled white rice to the salad (chilled 30 min in frig). My husband was sad that we didn't have enough for seconds!

This was just delicious! I love salads that combine fruit, veggies, salty, sweet, and spicy. So good. Perfect for a summer barbeque or in my work lunch with a piece of cold chicken.

Simple, tasty and refreshing! My husband loved it and can see it becoming a staple this summer while fresh pineapple is available!

I've made this tons of times now and love it. It's great for the summer and you can substitute the pineapple for mango or melon - it works equally well. I agree about the dressing being a little bland but with a bit more chilli, lime zest and salt it's superlative. I literally crave this if I haven't had it for a few days!

I thought this recipe had HUGE potential to be colorful, refreshing,and flavorful. Boy was I wrong. OK, it was colorful, but the dressing is horrible and turns the huge potential into huge disappointment. It could possibly be improved with substitutions such as sesame oil, rice vinegar, sesame seeds, more lime, etc. but I'd rather move on...

The dressing was way too mild.I had forgotten to use salt but I don't think that it would have made a difference.I did love the combo of cuc,tomatoes,and pineapples.

This recipe looks fabulous and I can't wait to make it but to the person looking for a substitution for fish sauce try soy sauce with a little anchovy paste mixed in. That's as good an approximation as you can get I think.

To the cook from Mexico City: Fish sauce can be found at an Asian grocery. While salty, it can add a complex nutty flavor to dishes such as this. It's not even close to fish stock so I wouldn't recommend the substitution. If you don't have a local market, perhaps you can find a place to order it online? Good luck

WOW! Thought this was a great summer salad. Was looking for a recipe for some red, orange and yellow tomatoes I had just bought and couldn't believe when this showed up on my weekly recipe flash. Had all ingredients on hand except pineapple so substituted with mango and watermelon which I did have. Also substituted 1/2 tbsp of veg. oil for sesame oil and at last minute decide to use parsley instead of cilantro. I think what I really liked about this salad was the great combination of the the hot pepper and cool mint. Plan to use this recipe again as a fresh summer salsa (for fish and meats) simply but cutting up fruit and vegetables smaller.

Delicious! Excellent dressing and great combination of ingredients which can be the base for ahi or shrimp etc. --but the jalapeno I used was very hot. Next time I'll omit the seeds until I toss and taste--then kick it up a bit if needed. Fresh peppers vary so much in heat that it's important to go easy since extra heat can always be easily added before serving. This is a keeper.

This was a pleasant surprise--a nice side dish for a light summer dinner. Since Hubby and I love salads, I made 1/2 of the recipe for the two of us, and served it with a simple homemade Egg McMuffin. We are wimps when it comes to chile peppers, so I used a combo of poblano and mild green chile peppers, and it turned out bland. Next time I would either use a serrano pepper or add some onions to the mix. Due to circumstances, I used canned pineapple chunks and dried mint leaves. We thought it was good enough to be repeated quite often.

This is very tasty and refreshing. It's lacking a bit of kick for me, so next time, I will add an extra chili or some Sambal Olek for more heat.

This is a delicious salad by itself, but it can also handle enhancements and additions - i.e. we added cooked shrimp and mango. Fantastic, light and perfect for either a summer lunch or a dinner salad starter.

very light and refreshing; added additional cilantro and mint as well as more lime juice. Served this with hoisin chicken lettuce wraps and received rave responses.

To the cook from Mexico City: Asian fish sauce is a condiment, like soy sauce or hot chile paste. It is similar to soy sauce, but contains fermented fish; it therefore has a unique, salty-fishy flavor. If you don't have it available, soy sauce combined with half an anchovy fillet might do the trick, or even just the soy sauce alone. Good luck!

Could anyone tell me what Asian fish sauce is? Can simple fish stock make a substitute?

A great light, cool, spicy, slightly sweet, and great salad. Everyone loved it....there was none left and I wanted some left-overs...oh well...guess i will have to make it again!

Served this with an addition of fresh watermelon cubes. Excellent light dressing. I increased the jalapenos to two. Most of the fruits/veggies may be chopped ahead, dressed just a while before serving. Guests loved it; asked for more--I'll revisit this one as it will add pop and pizazz to my summertime salad repertoire.
