I've made this several times and it's always a hit, even for those who may not like regular cheesecakes. It's fairly simple to make and tastes wonderful.

This is a wonderfully simple and unexpectedly delicious recipe. I made it several years ago and completely forgot where I'd gotten the recipe. After searching through countless cookbooks, as well as dozens of back issues of Bon Appétit, I am thrilled to have found it online! I'll make it again and again, and I'll never ever lose the recipe!
