This recipe was really unhelpful. No indication of what kind of apples to use (really important, it turns out, when you're making a pie), little to no measurements (which makes for really awkward flavor/texture profiles), WAY too much lemon... the pie turned out really terrible, and we had to discard it and make brownies from a box for the dinner we were going to. Kind of embarrassing. I wouldn't normally leave a review, but the 4 fork rating that this has right now is really misleading, and I don't really want a beginner stopping by and deciding that this is the recipe to use as a springboard. If you know how to make an apple pie, these broad instructions are unnecessary. If you're inexperienced enough in pie-making to need to look up an apple pie recipe, this really, REALLY isn't going to help you. You'd be better off digging through some cookbooks.

Made this pie twice, excellent! Used a 10 inch deep dish and had plenty of crust. Added a couple of apples and had no mace so used 1/4 tsp ginger in with spices. My oven may bake fast so start pie at 425 for 10 minutes, 350 for 25 minutes lightly tent entire pie with foil ( to keep from over browning) last 25 minutes. Cool, everyone loves this pie, had guests last weekend and they had some for breakfast.

This pie worked very well although I do have to agree with the person who missed measurements. I don't think it needed to be exact but some kind of approximation would have helped. I added the sugar to taste and the pie came out very tart....better than too sweet but not ideal.

This was a delicious pie! I had never made an apple pie before, and I still found the recipe fairly intuitive and easy to follow even without specific measurements. Like several other people, I did not make the crust that goes with the recipe, but made the buttermilk crust instead. I used a combination of Rome, Pippin, and Granny Smith apples (and ok, ok, I put one Jonagold in there even though it isn't a "pie" apple) and put them in a bowl with a small amount of apple cider to keep them from browning while I was peeling and slicing. I didn't want to add lemon juice since more lemon juice goes into the filling and some reviewers had said it was too lemony and too acidic. The cider worked perfectly, and I just drained the apples when I was ready to use them. I served it for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews! I would definitely make this again.

Made my own crust and really only used the recipe as a guide. (well, the recipe only IS a guide). Good measurements, bad form. Crust is good either in a KA or by hand. I use a KA and finish by hand in long smooth strokes to really get that butter massaged in there - overworked dough makes for a bad crust! Once the dough is a nice buttery silky feeling, you're done, don't do any more to it, let it rest. Anyway, it came out fabulous and the reason I give it three forks is because it serves an excellent purpose in making people try to make pies as well as helped me overcome my fear of just throwing things together when it came to pies. It's nice to have that kitchen confidence to boost your morale. And this is a recipe that's good for morale. Other than that, it's just a pie recipe.

My son and I baked this recipe together and we used half all-purpose and half whole-wheat and it worked perfectly. I also used only 7 apples, which was more than enough, and we added walnuts, dried cranberries, and raisins. Yum!

I had been happily baking cupcakes, cookies, and cake for years, but I plunged bravely into the pie-baking sphere last year when I was invited to a big Thanksgiving dinner at my boyfriend's parents' house. He tipped me off to the fact that apple pie was his mom's favorite, so I was determined to make my first pie a damn good one, and ultimately settled on this recipe. Suffice to say, it rocked. She (and everyone else) practically licked their plates clean. I made it with the Buttermilk Pie Crust recipe on this site and cooked the apple mixture on the stove to thicken the juices and brighten the flavors. (Word to the wise: add the lemon in small increments, tasting as you go, to control how sour it gets.) I served it with good-quality vanilla ice cream. The recipe is easy and rewarding to make, and I've been boldly baking pies ever since!

very easy and delicious! I used 2 frozen pie crusts due to time constraints. I used 1 for the pie and 1 for the top crust.Was just like grandmom use to make!

not only was this pie extraordinarily lemony(not in a good way)(and i only used half of the lemon juice that was called for) it was just not good. it was boring and i dont even think that i will keep the leftovers. the crust was also a disaster... making a pie crust in the food processor just destroys any possibility of lightness. it mashes everything down into a dense crust.. not a fan. i will not make this terrible recipe again.

Yummy!As good after dinner as with coffee in he morning. Made this with store bought pie dough (as a single mom I don't have the time to make dough) and it was so good. Mix of Rome and Mac apples, some sugar, butter, flour and cinnamon. Not too tart or too sweet. Just right! Will make again.

I used the Buttermilk crust recipe from this website (look at Old Fashioned Pecan Pie for link or search for it). I cut the sugar a bit and added some maple syrup. I don't cook much but everything came out okay. I thought I added too much cinnamon, but no problems. The filling was like the baked apples that we regularly make in New England. I used a mix of Granny Smith's and Pippins. Get hard apples. I thought it was delicious, though the lack of measurements may preclude repetition.

The last time I attempted an apple pie was 15 yrs. ago. It went from the oven to the garbage with no stops in between. Tried this recipe, baked it on a pizza stone at the temp and time prescribed. It was sooo perfect we ate it in one sitting. Easy and wonderful recipe!

I loved this pie but I didn't use the crust that came with it. I decided to go with the buttermilk crust that someone else suggested. It was awesome!

Four forks to my improvised version: 5 med. granny smiths, juice of 1/2 lemon, 1 T. brandy, 3/4 c. sugar, 3 T. cinnamon, pinch allspice, 3 T. flour, 1 T. butter. And PLEASE try the buttermilk pie crust on this site. it is linked from the ginger pear pie with golden raisins recipe. THE BEST!

Very Good! I made this pie for thanksgiving & out of 5 of us, there was nothing left! I did add about 2 Tbsp. of flour to the apple mixture to thicken and omitted the mace and added more nutmeg. Try this pie served with hard sauce! YUMMY!

This is a perfect apple pie! Yum. I made it for a family barbecue and everyone ate it up. It's been requested again for a shower and for Thanksgiving. I made it with a huge mound of apples--making it extra delightful for the eye and taste buds. I agree, don't skimp on the sugar or the lemon juice. Finding the balance between the two is what makes this so outstanding.

Instead of egg whites, I use milk to brush the crust with (old family secret) this makes the top curst very flaky. This recipe is good for a basic guide. Don't under estimate the lemon- it gives a real nice tartness, which will contrast well with the sugar- don't skimp on the sugar. And go with a little more butter- you can't go wrong with the fat- the more lard the better- you shouldn't be eating pie if your on a diet- an apple pie is about being american- big and fat! live it up! go heavy on the butter and sugar if your unsure...trust me I've won a few apple pie contests...there are 500 calories per slice but if you cut it back to 450 calories and it doesn't taste good then was it really worth saving the 50 calories. eat the pie- warm- with a scope of ice cream- enjoy and then walk around the block to get rid of those calories you would have saved if you skimped on the sugar or the butter or lard.

This is a fabulous pie. I've never made an apple pie before but have been around people a lot to know how. This is a great recipe. I like how you can measure out items to your liken. Even though mine didn't turn out perfect but completely eatible. Would definately make it again.

Yummy! I used splenda instead of white sugar, and a touch of brown sugar. Also added raisins and almonds.

I'm guessing that the "cook" from Toronto isn't really a cook at all. The introduction clearly states that the recipe is inprecise so that you use your OWN JUDGEMENT for the proportions. *I* have no trouble cooking that way. If you're inept in the kitchen, look for a recipe that tells you what to do down to the last grain of salt, don't use recipes intended for people that have actually walked into a kitchen before. This recipe was just great and I actually like the way that it lets me adjust the ingredients, because for an apple pie, the outcome depends on the tartness and juiciness of the apples, which always vary. What's wrong with brushing a pie crust with egg white? Hello! It's done all the time!! Also, the thickness of the crust depends on how thick or thin you roll it. You're not necessarily going to need every last scrap of it. Sheesh.

Sorry to have a negative attitude, but when I made this pie it come out terrible. If your gonna give a recipe you can atleast give detailed directions.I think that this recipe was terrible and I would never again use it in my life. And plus I thought that the crust was to think and I also think that you should put egg whites on a pie. I also think that when you make pie crust that it should be thin so that you can actually chew it and it cooks faster and tast better. Sinceraly Simone Weltch

Great recipe. My mother always made a lard crust-this is even better with the addition of butter. This is a classic recipe. Good just as it is. My mother(good Irish cook) added shredded cheddar cheese and dotted butter on top of the apples before she put the top pie crust on. It gave the apples a richer taste. I prefer not to put sugar in the crust, I like the old fashioned taste of unadulterated lard crust.

I made 2 of these pies a few weeks ago, and I had to come back to the site for this recipe, so I can make 2 more! Great taste with a minimum of ingredients. It goes well with fresh made vanilla ice cream.

This was the absolute best pie crust I've ever made. I admit I was as nervous as could be for pie crusts challenge my well-being and stress me to death. This was well worth the extra care in taking with the temperature of ingredients. The flavor and texture was the best of any crust I've ever had. I made it for my husband's birthday and wow was he ever impressed. I highly suggest if you know a pie lover this will knock em out!
