I am not a fan of decorated sugar cookies, but these were great. I can't imagine using another recipe from here on out. I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg with great results. I don't like meringue frosting so I used powdered sugar with milk and just a bit of corn syrup, cream cheese (sounds weird, but it's really good) and almond extract. They stayed crispy and fresh for 2 weeks and they freeze beautifully. Give them a try!

Every year, I make cookie baskets for coworkers and one coworker insists on all sugar cookies and this recipe ONLY. It's the brown sugar (I use dark) and freshly ground nutmeg that make it distinctive. I use sprinkles (daughter loves decorating them) and have not tried the icing recipe. The dough rolls well and can stay in the refrigerator for days before baking. Cookies taste great if you like them thinner and crunchier or thicker and softer.

Having just made a double batch of this recipe for Halloween cookies for my kids' classrooms (yes, crazy I know), I can vouch that this is one of the best sugar cookie recipes. I've used it in the past for Christmas and always receive compliments. I use freshly ground nutmeg but usually cut it down to 1/4 teaspoon. The recipe handles minor changes (like adding food coloring with the liquids or changing out some of the flour with cocoa) without ruining the texture of the dough. It rolls smoothly and is not sticky nor too stiff. I like that it's not overly sweet. I rarely use the special frosting in this recipe. Sprinkles before cooking or standard royal icing work just fine.

Easy, and I am not a baker. I rolled between, and baked on, parchment. This eliminated the need for extra flour and butter. A little bit of "spread" with baking, but not much. Used only a pinch of nutmeg. Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe, and it's not just for Christmas. My 4 year old and I made these for Valentine's Day, Easter, and a rainy play date. We use cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and all kids and adults think they're delicious. The dough is super quick and easy. I make double batches and freeze disks to use other times. Love this, it's now our go-to cookie recipe.

This recipe made delicious cookies! I followed as written with the exception of substituting 1/2 c. coconut oil & 1/2 c. butter instead of a 1 full c. butter -- I thought they might spread out too much with all butter? Coconut oil works like a charm in place of butter for cookies. I loved the taste - they look a little darker than normal sugar cookies because of the brown sugar, but have a very nice consistency. The dough does need to warm up or be worked a little before you can successfully roll it out.

I pull out my Dec 2000 issue every year to make these beautiful cookies. I also make them with a small and large holly cookie cutters and whip up a batches of these, just two icing colors and use them for hostess gifts. For Easter I have used them with egg shaped cutters and decorated them. They always look beautiful and I get lots of compliments.

Very easy recipe, and tasty results. I made these with my 2 year old, who is very into "baking projects" and wanted to use fall-themed cookie cutters. We substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg. The cookies came out very well, and stood up to being baked at various thicknesses (since my 2 year old also loves to help with the rolling pin). We skipped the frosting, but the cookie itself was a big hit.

Just made these last week with my little granddaughter. Used regular sugar & no nutmeg. Very easy to work with this forgiving dough--it just needs to warm up quite a bit to be easy to roll out. The cookies cut from scraps balled up together were just as good as the first roll out. Just sprinkled colored sugar on them, didn't ice the cookies. These are the perfect cookie, to my mind--crisp, buttery & not too sweet.

Awesome / easy recipe! I made cookies for my holiday cookie exchange at work and I won the prize "most visually appealing" using this recipe. I made a bunch of fun shapes using cookie cutters I already owned and sprinkles and other cookie decorators. Lots of fun, very easy. You will probably need more water than 12 tbls in the icing though.

Found this recipe when looking for sugar cookies to make with my 3 year old and her friends. The balance of flavors in the dough is perfect- all the kids loved it, but they're interesting enough for an adult palette, too. I had no problem with stickiness either- just rolled the dough between parchment paper. Worked like a dream. Some of our batches were thicker than others, and the cookies tasted good both thin (around 1/8") and thick (closer to 1/4"). Will definitely be saving this recipe for future use!

I have made these cookies every year since it was published in 2000. I cannot find my copy of that issue so I found it on-line and have read the reviews going back a year or so. My family and friends ask me every year if I am going to make these cookies. I follow the recipe as written and the cookies turn out great every time. I have not had any problems with working with the dough and the flavor of the cookie is perfect with the icing....nice nutmeg cookie and great icing. I use not so special food coloring and try to make the cookies a little thicker than suggested (just to make them easier to work with) I will continue to make these every year!

I am still a teenager and this was my first time making cookies all by myself. It was a bit of a challenge but once I got the hang of everything the cookies were great and my parents adored them. One thing I would change is not waiting until room temperature to roll the dough but instead to start rolling right away. The dough will get warmer once you squeeze and massage it o. so. tenderly.

Rating: 2
this was okay. think the title is a misnomer. followed recipe exactly with results much more like a shortbread cookie texture than a true sugar cookie. made them for kids, who liked them cuz they're very sweet with the icing, but the kids probably would have preferred either the spice from a snickerdoodle or just having a regular sugar cookie.

Rating: 4
First time making cookies to decorate and these were great. We tried cutting down on the flour as was suggested, but they were too sticky and we added more flour. I think that rolling them out between sheets of parchment keeps the original flour amount just right. We also rolled to 1/4" since we like them a little less crispy. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Yummy cookies! I just made them yesterday and used Halloween ghosts cutters. I left out the nutmeg and they were tasty, moist and perfect texture, not too crunchy and not too mushy, my 3yr old loved them. I refrigerated the dough for only about 20 min and rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper with no additional flour. I cheated by using store bought icing. This will be my go to cookie recipe.

I baked a batch of these cookies last night and they are delicious! They have a fabulous consistency after baking (not too hard, not too soft) and the dough is perfect for cookie-cutting! I didn't use the including icing recipe but instead just made a plain powdered sugar/milk icing for them instead. I'm baking more of them tonight! =)

I love these cookies--any time of year. They have a wonderful texture almost more akin to shortbread than sugar cookies, and are versatile. I added a teaspoon of lemon extract when making them this spring and thought the effect was great.

Considering I haven't baked cookies in about 12 years, I needed something easy to start off this year's baking. This was a great recipe for a beginner, and proved to be a hit with my family and neighbours. I wound up making another batch within a couple of days. Thank you

I don't know why others were having so much trouble with the dough - it was fine to work with so long as it was kept on the cool-side. I agree with the other reviewers in that 1/8" is too thin. I did not use the recipe provided for the frosting, but in the end these cookies weren't anything special; although I suspect Santa will clear his plate.

My family did not care for these at all. The cookies were hard, rather bland and the icing was inedible. I also think they should be rolled a bit thicker than 1/8 inch but I won't be trying them again so it doesn't really matter.

I am very impressed with this recipe. I modified the flour so that it would be gluten free otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. After reading the reviews I refrigerated it overnight and then let it get back to room temperature on its own (2 hours of sitting). The dough was easy to manipulate with the normal tools/tricks and held the shape well. They will be added to my regular rotation of Christmas cookies from now on because these were yummy.

I do a lot of holiday baking, and these sugar cookies always get the most raves. Like other reviewers, I drop the flour quantity a bit, and I have played with adding different flavorings like citrus zests, other spices, and poppy seeds, all to good effect. I saw that some reviewers have had trouble with the dough, but I find that chilling the dough if it starts to get soft keeps it easy to work with. I also roll the dough out on a nonstick (silicone) baking mat, cut them out on the mat, and pul up the excess dough, so that I don't have to transfer cut cookies - keeps the shape much cleaner. My kids have decorated these both with royal icing, and used sprinkles with a lemon juice-powdered sugar glaze. Great cookies!

Great recipe! So easy to work with! I replaced the nutmeg with a few shakes of cinnamon and @ 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Delicious. My 6 year old daughter and I had such fun. The dough is so easy to handle.

Everybody raves about this recipe--people refer to them as "those nutmeg cookies." I like that the cookie isn't super sweet...especially because I use a different icing recipe that's very sweet: 3 c. confectioner's sugar, 2 tbsp. room temp butter, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and a few tablespoons of milk, beat with an electric mixer. (I add the milk gradually as I'm mixing.) I usually skimp on the flour a bit and keep an eye on the cookies as they tend to brown quite quickly. My husband prefers them thicker, like shortbread, while I like them a bit thinner and crispy.

No. Nononono. The taste of these is great but they are HORRIBLE to work with, I much prefer cookies that actually stick to the cutters and make life easier. They are wayyyyy too soft. Also I added some orange zest, tastes really nice with the nutmeg.

Made this today with two four year olds for Halloween cookies. I left out the nutmeg but otherwise left the recipe as is. It is the easiest sugar cookie dough that I've worked with yet. Both kids had a fun time and had no problems working with the dough. I made them a bit thicker, baked them on stoneware and left them in for 10-12 minutes and they are so soft and yummy. Made half the batch today and it's gone. Will make the rest tomorrow. Also, I made a simple icing of powdered sugar, evaporated milk and vanilla.

If one follows the recipe,it is a perfect thin, sweet cookie that is excellent with a hot beverage. I did some with frosting and some without.

I have enjoyed eating these and will make them again. Next time, I'll use this recipe's frosting.

Fantastic. I did not make the icing, I just decorated with sugar. The dough was very easy to work with, baked up nicely, and best of all tasted wonderful. Everyone raved. I think that if you like your food on the bland side (like the six-year-old mentioned below, I presume), you probably won't like the addition of the nutmeg. Everyone in my family thought it was a wonderful addition, and this has become our new favorite sugar cookie.

I just finished making these cookies and came back to the site to see the comments b/c we thought these were absolutely terrible! I think it was the nutmeg and brown sugar that made it taste horrible. Before frosting, my 6 yr old took one bite and spit it out. I figured it would get better with frosting, nope. We only used 1/2 the dough tonight and I will be disposing of the rest of the dough. It was a fun family activity to decorate them, but I will never make these again.

I liked the taste and texture of the cookies though my husband and I found them too sweet (even though I didn't firmly pack the brown sugar). Next time I'll add less sugar to the cookies since the sugar in the frosting is overwhelming. The dough is really forgiving. Very, very easy to work with. I used a star cookie cutter and they look beautiful. 1/8" is too thin.

This was just okay. The cookies came out much more like shortbread than sugar cookies. Very dense and not very flavorful. I used prepared frosting - couldn't get behind 9 cups of sugar - to "glue" the sprinkles on. Once the frosting and sprinkles were added, they were much improved but still not great. Next year, I'll definitely try another recipe.

Yeah, this was a typical-shmypical cookie recipe. Good, but why do you have these guys on your oh-so gourmet site? I think it would have been better with a little more frosting. Maybe orange flavored frosting. Yes, that's it, orange frosting, and maybe a little fruit. Grapes, yes splendid, I'm gonna try this recipe again. It'll be great with a little improvements to jazz these soon-to-be delicious cookies. They'll be a hit. I'll come back with a new recipe. A new one, yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

Here are a few tips for those whom left negative comments: 1. Always use new ingredients. Never use ingredients that have been sitting around in your cupboard for months! Especially when giving baked goods as gifts! 2. Make sure your ingredients are properly stored.(In air-tight containers and in a cool, dry place... away from the oven and not on a high shelf) 3. When using fresh ingredients rather than pre-ground (such as nutmeg) always use less. The flavor will always be more intense when it is fresh 4. Make sure your oven is baking at the correct temperature. Use an oven thermometer. 5. If you live at High Altitude, you'll have to adjust the recipe. HAPPY BAKING!

My husband and I made these cookies for our holiday gift bags. The dough worked well for rolling and cutting. We didn't even try the icing recipe - it just looked too strange.

I made this recipe with my 4 year old Grandson at Christmas. Instead of rolling the dough out, we squished it out like it was play dough and he cut the shapes out.

Don't know what you did Arlington, but I agree with the other viewers - this is the best recipe for "cookie cutter" cookies that I've ever tried. The dough was very easy to make, and after chilling, it rolled beautifully. Tastes good, too! I made essentially the same frosting - just followed the directions on the powdered meringue container. We had about 8 grownups and kids all decorating around the table! Used gel food coloring, though - kinda' hard to get the colors just right, so we had some psychedelic Christmas cookies.

A lovely cookie recipe. I am thankful that I read the reviews before making. I used an non-hydroginated margerine and loved the texture and flavor. I also needed to refrigerate the wrapped dough for two days and I found no problems. I also halved the frosting, but made a double batch of cookies.

I also once used royal frosting and found it to dry also immediately and made it difficult to work with. So when I tried the frosting recipe here, viola so easy -- this is a keeper. I used this recipe for Valentine cutouts and everyone who received them as a gift wants the recipe.

I made these at Christmas. They were so buttery as to overwhelm the flavor and came across as greasy. I didn't like the twang that the untraditional spices added, but of course that's just a personal preference.

I made these cookies for Valentine's Day with some kids that I know, and they LOVED them! They were moist and had a great flavor...and the cookie dough was great for munching. We even mildly burnt a batch and the kids still ate them and said they were good. The icing looked great and was very easy to work with for adults and kids. It dried very smooth and they looked great. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to everyone, it is not too sweet and very tasty!

I was on a marathon mission to find the BEST cut out cookie for Valentines Day. I made 4 different recipes and these get the blue ribbon. I didn't make the frosting though. I used sprinkles. These have great flavor!

Everyone who ate them stated that they were the best sugar cookies they had ever had.

I'm not a big sugar cookie fan and viewed the cookies as a vehicle for the frosting. I had waaaaaaaaay more frosting than I needed. I didn't pipe it on, I used paintbrushes. My kids enjoyed it, though I could not duplicate the glorious results shown. Even so, some folks said they were too beautiful to eat. I'm making them again with my kids to give away for Valentine's Day.

This recipe is just so wonderful and easy!Everyone I made these cookies for just couldn't get enough. I even had to make them for friends after the holidays.

I thought these cookies were great. They were chewier and had more flavor than typical sugar cookies. I didn't add the nutmeg because I am not crazy about the spice. The frosting was great too - easy to make and made for beautiful cookies.

This dough was difficult to roll out. The frosting was tough to duplicate. A little dab of color would greatly affect the desired outcome. We ended up with neon frosting. The finished frosted cookie was too sweet. I anonymously left the cookies in my staff lounge. No thanks.

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. The brown sugar/caramel cookie flavor was good, but my complaints are mostly with the frosting, and the depiction of the frosting in the magazine. I know the professionals will always have better looking results, but the smooth finish and intense colors shown are nearly unreal (especially using the formulas provided). A close inspection also indicates that the decorating frosting is a different consistency from the background frosting, which wasn't mentioned in the recipe. Additionally, the cookies should be rolled thinner, and the frosting needs some flavor. As it is, it will give you a toothache. I think But other than that....

The caramel flavor from the brown sugar is a nice change of pace, and I felt like an artist tweaking the frosting coloring instructions to my own taste. I'd never iced cookies before. Very fun but a lot of work.

I agree with the previous reviewer. The brown sugar creates a different flavor. The color of the cookie is much more golden. The nutmeg adds a nice spice flavor. That being said, my children loved them and had great fun decorating the cookies. I would make these again and recommend them to anyone tired of the same old sugar cookie. Happy Holidays to my fellow Epicurious readers.

Due to the brown sugar, this isn't the classic frosted "sugar cookie" that I am used to. It is ok, but the brown sugar gives it a carmel flavor. Not bad though.
