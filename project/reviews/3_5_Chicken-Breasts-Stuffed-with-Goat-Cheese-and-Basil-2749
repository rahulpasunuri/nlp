Very nice for mid-week meal. Had to broil the chicken rolls to get them a more attractive color after baking. I thought the sauce for 4 was enough for 2.

This recipe is so versatile. I adapted to what I had in the house (feta instead of goat cheese, sundried tomatoes instead of green onions, panko instead of regular breadcrumbs). I made a quick balsamic reduction to drizzle on top instead of the mushroom sauce. I didn't use ANY butter - just sprayed the chicken with olive oil spray. Turned out fantastic! I will say that I ended up having to cook 2 chicken breasts for 35 minutes, so way longer than the recipe time. We will definitely make this again!

This is one of my family favorites. I use herbed goat cheese and sometime leave out the scallions. I also have substituted panko for bread crumbs. I add a shallot to the mushroom sauce for added flavor. I have even left out the white wine - none in my daughters' house that night - and it is still tastes great.

I haven't made this in years, but it is so easy. Made it again tonight, and husband just loved it. I used a dry Sherry wine for the mushrooms, and it was awesome. Chicken did require an additional 5 minutes to cook all the way. Next time, instead of basil, I might use Cilantro. Served with mash potatoes and grilled summer squash. YUM YUM.

I substituted ricotta for the goat cheese, and added a slice of prosciutto in each roll. For the sauce, I was out of dry white wine, so I used Patron Anejo tequila. It was really really good!

This is a really good, easy weeknight dish that is also impressive for a dinner party. I almost always substitute spinach for the basil, or use them together. I also tend to use more greens than the recipe calls for--about a cup of chopped spinach. And easy on the butter--half as much still makes for a rich sauce.

Didn't make the sauce but the chicken was really good. I added a couple of cloves of garlic, minced, and bit of finely chopped parsley. Will try it with the sauce soon but it was good on its own.

My family loved this recipe. As an alternative to the goat cheese (I ran out), I used Boursine Shallot and Chive with wonderful results.

I took the advice of some of the other cooks. The chicken definitely needs to cook for 25 minutes. I added a splash of balsamic to the mushroom mixture and it was great. (would have been great either way, but the balsamic cut the richness of the butter a little - which was necessary). Used dried basil - next time will use fresh. Also used regular breadcrumbs, but next time will use Panko for a crispier crunch. My husband loved it and said he was impressed. I thought it was very good. Should have doubled the mushrooms. Next time.

Husband loved it. Added pesto to goat cheese with no basil. He said the cheese would have overpowered the meal without the mushroom sauce.

This was great. I used boursin cheese instead of goat cheese and since it was already flavored I put the onions in with the mushroom sauce. Excellent!

Used lots of basil and added sundried tomatoes. Try toothpicks instead of string, worked for me. Took another suggestion to brown in pan before baking which eliminated the need for pouring butter on top (sprayed a little Pam on top). Increased sauce ingredients, added some thyme and only used 2 Tbs butter at the end to reduce guilt. So yummy!

I don't understand how everyone loves this recipe. I mean, it's okay, but it wouldn't work in my household on a regular rotation because of all the butter and cheese in it. No wonder so many Americans are obese...they eat dishes like this regularly. I did everything according to the recipe, and added the suggestions of more basil, less butter, and added some sun dried tomatoes to the cheese mixture. I wouldn't make the effort to make this again, but it wasn't bad tasting, just way too fattening for something just so-so. I'd rather eat ice cream. :)

I used Panko bread crumbs and fresh basil from my garden. I added dried cherries to the goat cheese mixture for color and flavor and balsamic vinegar to the mushroom sauce to give it some "zing;" I think this could be eaten without the sauce. I would make it again. It was delicious!

I slightly made some changes: Added chopped ham and used herbed goat cheese instead. Also 1/2'd the b crumbs and added parmesan for the crust. I was not impressed with the stuffing inside. Would change around next time. Loved the sauce!!!

For better appearance and ease of preparation for a dinner party, I browned the chicken lightly in butter after rolling in Panko. I then removed them to a baking dish and used the skillet with its browned bits for making the wine sauce. Do use more fresh basil as previously noted. The chicken breast needed only 20 - 25 minutes to complete cooking.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except I halved the butter (poured 1T over the top and used 2T in the sauce). Did not need to tie it. After 30 mins the chicken seemed done and I turned on the broiler to brown the top, just for a few minutes. I really think the fresh basil and scallions together is terrific and am surprised people are subsituting premade processed cheese like Boursin; the fresh herb nature of the filling is a big part of its charm. I served this with boiled baby Yukon gold potatoes, and broccolette sauteed in a little olive oil with garlic. The mushroom sauce was great with the potatoes too, though there was not a lot of it.

Rating: 4
Yes, I would certainly make this again. Very elegant dish, although the string gets stuck in the breading so be careful cutting the chicken and removing the string. My husband liked this dish -- also served with the Balsamic-Marinated Radicchio with Fresh Ricotta on this same site -- which he did not like as much. This chicken dish was so easy to make. I had to cook longer than 20 mins, not sure why, and also browned the top a bit with the broiler as it looked liked microwaved chicken on the top.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a really solid recipe. I used panko for the breadcrumbs, and some herbed goat cheese from Trader Joe's. I seasoned the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and garlic before I added the cheese and bread crumbs, and everything turned out wonderful. I think that I will use more basil next time since I could not really taste it. Also, definitely double the mushrooms! That sauce was so incredibly good!

I just made this tonight. My husband and I loved it! I didn't have green onions so I added pancetta. I know, not really a substitute, but I thought it would be good. I also used panko bread crumbs and they worked well. Instead of rolling the chicken, I just folded it in half. I didn't have anything for the sauce, so instead I pureed some the slow-roasted tomatoes and garlic I made this morning and add a spoonful on the side of the plate. It has a very intense flavor, so you don't need much. The goat cheese in the chicken really puts this dish over the top.

They took some work but in the end they were wonderful. I ended up making this for a dinner party and people loved them. I used gluten free bread crumbs for the 2 people there who had cleiac's and it worked very well. I was going to add some strips of sundried tomato for a little color but forgot to pick them up. Bummer

Will not rate, as I was unable to follow recipe as written. However, the family (husband, 14 & 12 year olds) DEVOURED it. 3.5 fo sho or better. Yellow onion in lieu of green onions, more basil than called for, and panko (to replace breadcrumbs) used in my version; chicken breasts from local butcher were ginormous; all family members took a turn at pounding them flat, but it still took twice as long as recommended, but then again, makes perfect sense. Will make again, keeping more basil and panko as a replacement for bc's...

I am not that great of a cook, but my boyfriend thought I was after I made this for dinner last night. I did use the thin cut chicken breast so the chicken would cook through faster and I used high-quality goat cheese and organic ingredients (veggies, chicken stock, chicken etc) so it was really delish. Also, to cut down on some of the fat factor, I halved the butter and I don't think it was missing anything at all. I also used baby bello mushrooms and doubled them - great idea! I would definitely make this again and will try panko and sun dried tomatoes next time!

Yum. I substituted diced feta and provolone for the goat cheese. If you use melty or soft cheese such as Montrachet, you might want to mix the cheese with a little flour and/or egg or something to keep it from squirting everywhere when you cut the breasts before serving.

This had a very nice flavor. Like other reviewers though, I had trouble pounding the chicken thin enough and it took much longer than 20 minutes to cook. To solve both of these problems, I think I would use chicken scallopini cuts next time.

I created this dish and submitted it to Gourmet 20 years ago when goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes were newly popular. What a kick to see so many people have enjoyed and modified it. I love the panko idea (panko wasn't on the market when this was created)! Have fun, everyone!

I have made this twice, first without any modification and it was good. However, I tried this last night with a few modifications and it was delicious. First, I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt and black pepper to taste. I substituted goat cheese for alouette and added sun dried tomato. Its a must try!

Like it needs to be said again, this recipe is amazing! I thought it'd be good but I was still surprised. I do think that the sauce is a huge part of this. It complements the chicken beautifully. I did cut way back on the butter though. I just used about two tablespoons to saute the mushrooms. I just used a Chevre and would not use an herbed cheese such as Boursin. The simplicity of the recipe and the flavors combined make it an exceptional dish without being over done. Oh and I did need to bake the chicken longer than 20 minutes.

3-1/2 forks actually. I made this last night, using the suggestions from a few reviewers. Panko is a must, I used Boursin, added basil to it. Baby bella mushrooms, added extra wine and stock and reduced it and thickened it. Sauteed the breasts first then finished in the oven. My husband loved it and he can be a pain to please. Served with spinach and rice.

mmm I too used panko. You need to really get at the chicken to pound it thin enough. I got mine out to about 8 x 10 inches - took a good amount of time and sore arms but it was worth it. It rolled just fine and stayed together without string. Lightly browned in an oven safe skillet then into the 350 oven to finish. Deglazed the pan with white wine and finshed with just a little butter - no need to use a full stick.

Have made this recipe more than a dozen times and it is always delicious. Use whatever I have in the fridge. Have made it with goat cheese, olives and fresh basil. Tonight I am making it with goat cheese, a leek instead of the green onion which I sauteed with garlic and pine nuts and added to the goat cheese with a dollop of pesto since I did not have any fresh basil left in my garden. I always saute the chicken first in my cast iron skillet to get it nice and brown and than throw it in the over for approximately 15 minutes. I take the chicken out of the over and put on a plate tented with foil. I will than deglaze the pan with wine, chicken stock and a tab of butter pour over chicken. My husband love this dish!

One more positive review to add to hundreds. Boursin for goat's cheese, toothpicks for string, panko for breadcrumbs - these slight changes make it even easier. The sauce is rich and delicious, but much more like a side than a sauce - this, however, is not a complaint. I make everything, including the mushrooms, well in advanc,e then pour the melted butter over the chicken when it goes in the oven and reheat the mushrooms just before serving.

Well, ever the pantry chef - I started with this recipe in mind, but used what I had. Ricotta, Parmesan, and Cheddar. I shredded the later. I added rosemary from the shrubs (literally) growing in my front garden, instead of dried basil. I reconstituted some currants and added prosciutto to the stuffing mix. Pounded the chicken breasts as directed. Read the reviews and decided to not put the breading, and seared the chicken breasts before roasting in the oven. I sprinkled with a little sweet paprika, sliced and served on a platter for a buffet dinner. Note, I served it with lemon smashed red potatoes. Steam the potatoes, mash lightly with masher, adding a little lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, salt and pepper.

We found that goat cheese with sun dried tomatoes from our Famers' Market worked very well. I would agree with the previous review that Panko breadcrumbs make a big difference. Although I usually serve the chicken hot, I have (thanks to a cook from North Carolina) served it cold for a summer buffet, and it worked perfectly.

This doesn't really need 599 reviews but here I go. I loved this recipe. It was very simple to prepare and absolutely delicious. Fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes with the cheese. Panko breadcrumbs.

These were really good - subbed herb and garlic goat cheese and Italian breadcrumbs - left out other seasonings. Also added chopped sundried tomatoes. Big hit - with or without the Mushroom sauce... although that's great over whipped potatoes.

This is a good basic recipe, however tying a rolled breast, then egg and breading it doesn't suit, as you have to take the string off to eat it, and that tears off the breading; duh. I did it without the breading, adding toasted walnuts to the goat cheese. Adding sun dried tomatoes to the mushroom mixture would've been good as well.

I made this dish for my family, which is ranges from "safe eater" to foodie, and they all loved it. I used two kinds of goats cheese; one plain which I added lots of fresh herbs, and one that was flavored with garlic and herb and that too I added more herbs, including fresh tarragon. Both were very successful. I cooked it 30 minutes and it never dried out. The mushroom (red) wine sauce was good but not necessary probably. I do feel like it's good to have it though, for those that like sauces available. I think some carmalized onions and mushrooms would do though. I'll definitely do this again!

This was great and easy to make. I changed a few things. I stuffed the chicken with blue cheese, onion and toasted walnuts. Then I followed the sauce recipe, except that I used red wine instead of white. I love blue cheese/red wine combo. I found it did take my chicken closer to 35 minutes to bake, but I think it was because it was a very large chicken breast and even though I tried, it did not pound out very thin.

My boyfriend and I loved this chicken! It was pretty easy and quick to make. I did make some changes: used philidelphia light garlic and herb cream cheese instead of the goat cheese blend, and panko breadcrumbs instead of the regular ones. The sauce turned out kind of sour for me (perhaps too much wine), so I added some flour mixed with milk. Turned out deeeelish!

The first time I made this I followedthe receipe exactly but skipped the sauce. The chicken did need an additional 10 min baking time in my oven. It was delish!!!Last week I made it at our timeshare in CABO but had to improvise - no oven. Skipped the egg wash and bread crumbs and pan fried in a bit of Pam cooking spray. Again, it was great and a big hit with everyone there. TIP: bought turkey truss kits and used the small skewers to close the chicken bundles rather than using twine. I will make this over and over!! Very easy and exceptionally tasty!

I made this exactly as written, and it turned out great. I agree with other reviewers that the chicken actually takes about 30 minutes to cook. Since I was out of kitchen twine, I used toothpicks to hold the chicken together. I probably would have enjoyed it more if my dinner partner hadn't said that my pants were tight...but that definitely wasn't the recipe's fault. Next time I'm making it for myself.

Ive made this recipe several times but always substituted with Panko bread crumbs. I also add more basil which I chopped more to release the flavors. Recently, another variation I made and will do again was to replace the bread crumb coating with prosciutto. (Thick-cut bacon also works.) I took each chicken breast (which I had flattened not quite as much as before to keep them plump for the grill) and wrapped with 1-2 pieces of prosciutto and secured tightly with approximately 6-8 round toothpicks. This held the stuffing and juices inside to keep it tender while on the grill. We grilled the larger breast halves for 20 minutes and the smaller quartered breast halves (lady portions) for 15 minutes. Afterwards, we placed the chicken in an oven pan to keep warm (200º) for the party we were taking them to. The extra 10-15 minutes on low heat finished the cooking and kept them juicy. The toothpicks and pork were removed prior to serving. I skipped the sauce on this version. This is a really easy, delicious recipe variation you can prepare an hour ahead of your guests or for larger parties. Would probably work well done in small appetizer portions too.

This recipe always gets rave reviews from my family. I add chopped garlic, and sun dried tomatoes to the cheese. I typically find chips or crackers in the cupboard that are going stale, food process them until they are small pieces and then coat the chicken in them.

Made the chicken only and it was really great and easy. Too hot in the kitchen so asked my husband to put the pan and chicken on the grill on 350. Cooked for about 30 minutes and it was perfect.

Really great recipe. I modified it a little by adding sun dried tomatoes and pan frying them on high with butter. I made the sauce with shallot instead of mushrooms and it was ok, but looked ugly. To be honest, the chicken didn't need it. The presentation was excellent. Next time I will add more basil and sun dried tomatoes.

Not a winner. Bland and way too much preparation for what it turned out to be. The mushroom sauce had nothing to do with the goat cheese filling. And it should have been baked longer or at a higher temp. Mine did not even brown at the temp specified. There were leftovers but they went in the trash.

Excellent when following a few of previous reviewer's suggetions such as more basil, and I required 10 more minutes cooking time. I used my instant read thermometer and removed the chicken from the oven between 160-165 F. Also, I think it is important to take the raw chicken breast, and slice it (as if to butterfly) crossways in to two pieces, then to pound them. They are easy to roll with filling that way and cook up nicely. I would have liked more sauce, so I would have increased both liquids (wine and stock). The flavor was intense but not too rich. Excellent presentation when served over sauteed spinach.

Rating: 4
Warning! This is one of those reviews where the cook changes the recipe and declares it so much better. First, I didn't have green onions or basil, but I did have pesto in the freezer. I just added a generous dollop of pesto to the goat cheese and mixed it up. Easy. Wonderful. For the sauce: I followed the recipe through to cooking the mushrooms in wine. Then I removed them with a slotted spoon, put them over the chicken and poured the remaining liquid into a measuring cup. I made a roux of butter and flour and added the chicken stock, cooking until I had a sauce with body. Then I added the mushroom liquid and another generous dollop of pesto. I brightened the sauce with some grated lemon peel and finished off with one tablespoon of butter. Wicked, I'd-just-like a-spoon-please good!

A favorite in our household. Great for company We prepare it up to 1 day prior to serving, mixing goat cheese with boursin or alouette garlic and herb and use about a dozen fresh basil leaves. Instead of bread crumbs we use Italian flavored panko.Once made and coated, we roll it tightly in foil and refrigerate until an hour before serving, We then remove the foil and bake as instructed. Never fails to please all.

Rating: 4
We followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. We did leave the chicken in the oven for 25 minutes just to make sure it was cooked through, but that was the only change. The amount of basil was perfect and more would have been overkill. We also left one unsliced and cut it up cold the next day for mini-french bread sandwiches. The goat cheese is so creamy it was like a spread so we didnt have to use mayo or mustard on the bread. Delicious and we will definitely make again.

Rating: 2
This dish did not live up to my standards. Forget the sauce...it doesn't complement the dish at all. The chicken stands well on its own, however keep close watch on the cooking time. It took twice as long for my chicken breasts to cook through at the suggested temp. I used three times as much basil as other reviewers suggested and also panko crumbs which provided a nice crispy crust.

We made a bunch of adjustments to this recipe, and it was amazing. Used a shallot instead of green onion (didn't have any), quadrupled the amount of fresh basil, and only used about 2 tbsp of butter in the whole dish. we did not bread the chicken. we butterflied and stuffed the chicken instead of pounding it thin and using string, and seared it in a pan about 3 mins each side before baking it for 20 mins in a 400 degree oven. sprinkled a little shredded mozzarrella cheese on the top of them and broiled for about 3 mins before serving. this is very rich and quite tasty and easy to make!

I loved this recipe. My husband only found it so-so. He found the goat cheese to strong for the other flavors in the dish. Next time I'll try it with a different cheese, or a blend of cheeses. I read a ton of the reviews before making this dish, and followed lots of the suggestions. The extra basil was a MUST. I added about 15 leaves, they really cook down, so you can add even more than I did and still be okay. Next time I'll remember to sprinkle some garlic for additional flavor. I purchased thinly sliced chix breast, so no messy pounding. Also, i just folded it and it stayed together just perfectly. I used panko crumbs and they were delicious. I broiled it the last few minutes to make it crispy. The sauce was delicous! You don't HAVE to have it, but I served this with penne and it made a great sauce! I'm going to try it again tonight with a different kind of cheese and a different kind of sauce to see if I can wow my husband, as I really feel like this dish is a keeper!

This is awesome. i made as directed, but without the sauce  i dont think it needed it. a hint on pounding the chicken breasts: put them (one at a time) inside a large zip-bag and then pound  cuts down on mess from flying chicken juice and keeps the chicken from tearing.

I added chopped sundried tomatoes to the basil/cheese mixture as well as a bit of chopped garlic. And I skipped over all the labour-intensive pounding and wrapping the chicken with string business--works just as well to butterfly the breasts and stuff that way. It's going to be messy either method you use! I've made this dish a couple of times for dinner parties and took from both delighted silent nods and muffled groans of enjoyment that it was a hit. I've lost count of how many people I've passed it on to. It's definitely become one of my most requested dishes :)

The chicken was definitely tasty. I added sun dried tomatoes to the stuffing, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. I had a hard time flattening the chicken, resulting in a messy blob of chicken, all tied up with string (which was really hard to get out, once it was breaded & cooked!). That was probably my fault, though! The only complaint I had was the mushroom wine sauce. I didn't even end up putting it on the chicken 'cause it looked so unappetizing, and didn't seem to go with the flavor of the chicken at all. Instead, I squeezed lemon juice over it right before I served it, and that was really all it needed (it's so flavorful on it's own). I also broiled it for a few minutes at the end because it wasn't browning. It was good, and my husband said he enjoyed a lot (but wouldn't say he "loved" it). I'll probably make it again, though, 'cause it was good, and not too difficult.

I, too, did not bread the chicken. Instead I pan seared it for a few minutes on each side and then used that same pan to make the mushroom sauce. Also, the recipe does not state what temp to bake the chicken: I baked it at 400F for 20 minutes and it worked well. The mushrooms were very delicious. I also used less better than was asked for in this recipe. It was definitely one of my new favorites. Absolutely delicious!!!

This was delicious! I decided at the last minute to skip the breading, so just seared it in a pan and popped it in the oven - it was really, really good. I also managed to mangle the chicken and it all feel apart, but the taste was what mattered - and there was plenty of taste! I used about 1/3 to 1/2 the butter in the recipe - cutting down each addition - it was still very rich. I had some sauce left over, so added a can of evaporated milk and extra goat cheese and served it over rice for lunch today. Very good!

Exceptional recipe! I definately agree with the previous reviewer--panko bread crumbs are a must. I used 4 tablespoons of butter instead of 2 to drizzle on the chicken--helps it to brown. I would actually DOUBLE the sauce recipe next time, it really adds to the dish. I also added garlic to it. Fresh basil is also key. A wonderful dish that is definately company material.

This was so tasty! I used Japanese bread crumbs and added corn starch to the sauce. My 9yr even liked it. I served orzo as a side but it was a little too rich to go with this meal in my opinion. The suggestions by other cooks were very helpful. Allison

Tasty, if you like goat cheese. Used thin chicken cutlets to save time. Easy to make and looks fairly impressive. I don't think that the sauce added much, though I halved it.

Great recipe! Easy and tasty. I did add garlic to the sauce and sprinkled some Feta cheese on top of the chicken while it baked, but other than that, stayed true to the recipe. I have four children and they all loved it. Not always easy finding a recipe the whole family loves, and not time consuming. This will be a family regular.

I made this dish a couple of nights ago and my husband and I both loved it. I took a clue from another reviewer and started my filling with Alouette (garlic and herb) instead of plain goat cheese. My husband does not eat mushrooms so I altered the sauce to be a white wine and shallot reduction. I also cooked the chicken for about 30 minutes and then finished it under the broiler. My husband actually did a 'happy dance' when he tasted this! We had leftovers lastnight and my husband commented that it was as delicious the second night as the first. Very yummy!

This dish was delicious! I added garlic to both the chicken and the sauce as others have suggested. I forgot to flatten the chicken, but just cooked it for a little longer. It's not too hard to prepare and makes an impressive dish for company (at least my company).

I have made this recipe for at least five years now. It is a STAPLE in my house! I use thin-sliced breast cutlets and pound them thin before rolling them with goat cheese. I quickly fry it in a little oil before baking it, so that it is crispy all around. I also melt a little more butter than the recipe calls for. I serve it will lemoned green beans. Absolutely delicious!

Fantastic and easy.

If you opt to not bread the chicken, sear the outside before baking - it helps keep it very moist. I baked for the chicken 20 min and then broiled for 5 more (after covering with more cheese) and it turned out perfect!!

Good! I was concerned over all the flavors - mushrooms,wine,chicken,goat cheese, basil...but it works! Beautifully. Took suggestions and added chopped sun dried tomatoes - a MUST. Also added garlic to goat cheese mixture. I didnt broil them, but turned up oven to 450 for the last 5 minutes to brown nicely.

My husband and I both loved this! I used Panko bread crumbs with really added something I think. I also used julienned dried tomatoes in oil. Yum! I cooked it for an extra 10 minutes and then put the chicken under the broiler for a couple minutes until lightly browned. No need to tie with string.

SO TASTY! I added extra basil to the filling and didn't need the string. The next time I make it I will double the mushroom sauce. I served Orzo pasta on the side.

This was delicious and quite easy to make since there isn't much chopping to do. I didn't need to use string on the chicken either, it stayed together with no problem. Unfortunately though, I undercooked it and had to throw it back in the oven, and I even pounded it paper thin. The 20 minutes should be hiked up to about 25. Next time I'll cut back on the butter in the sauce too so it's not so heavy. The chicken is good without the sauce.

Rating: 4
I have made this about 100 times and I think I've mastered it. The trick here is to pound the chicken paper thin and not to overcook (or undercook) it. Cooking times vary depending on the thickness of the chicken. I broil it on all sides to finish it off and usually when it looks somewhat well done by the broiler - it's done. I never tie the chicken - it's thin enough to roll and it stays together fine. Also, instead of goat cheese I sometimes use Boursin or Alouette. Delicious. I cut the amount of butter in the sauce by half and it's delicious! Enjoy

Rating: 3
It was very good, but to add a bit more flavor I would season the breading with a bit of garlic and more salt. I suggest doubling the mushroom sauce recipe - we didn't feel we had enough. This was a great dish and it was fairly quick to make!

Rating: 3
I didn't quite cook this long enough ( i had doubled the recipe and it needed more time) as well as it needed more salt in the cheese mixture(taste it first, before stuffing) quite a bit of work, however i think more cooking time would make the cheese/chicken combo amazing. THe sauce, i will make the sauce for other things as well. amazing!

Rating: 3
Used a basil goat cheese mixed with pesto and sundried tomatoes as the stuffing. Didn't pound the chicken too thin, so it stayed really juicy (though took longer to cook). As a previous poster said, the breasts didn't brown as well as I thought they would (despite the longer cooking time), so I drizzled some extra chicken stock/melted butter on top and put them back in for a bit, and they turned out beautifully. Much easier than browning them as suggested in an earlier post (esp given that I didn't tie them...). My husband gave the dish a thumbs up, had two portions, and then ate all the extra cheese stuffing that had fallen out in the pan.

Rating: 3
so delicious that even my toddler ate it! i added some sundried tomatoes like another poster & it just added to the already wonderful flavor. i used the 1/2 cup butter called for to sprinkle over rolls & make the sauce. i did not add the 4 tbs to the sauce at the end, but whisked in some flour to thicken it. you could not tell...still tasted fantastic. i also used chicken that was already pounded thin which saved some time.

Rating: 3
Yummy! I will be making this again. I made the chicken breasts as directed, but couldn't bring myself to use all the butter in the mushrooms. I used half butter and half olive oil to saute and them didn't stir in the chilled butter at the end. We didn't miss it.

Very good dish. My wife loved it; asked for it again, soon; said, 'Don't lose the recipe'. Made it as written. Used Panko bread crumbs for a crisper coating -worked well. Will probably double the sauce next time, or at least 1 1/2 times the original. Would go 3 1/2 forks if I could.

I normally like goat cheese and so did not hesitate to use 100% goat cheese in this dish. However it tasted stronger when cooked and when I make it again I will use the boursin cheese other reviewers mentioned using. I also added lots more fresh basil than recommended and followed another reviewers recommendation and used sundried tomatoes. My boyfriend loved this dish.

Tasty... definately make the sauce to go with it. It took longer than 20 minutes to cook all the way through. I might try some sun-dried tomatoes inside next time.

I made this for my husband who is very picky about flavour and taste. I don't eat mushrooms but I made the sauce anyway. We both loved the chicken breasts and my husband ate most of the mushroom sauce. This will definitely stay on the favourites lists. I took the advice of other reviewers and added tons of basil and sundried tomatoes to the filling (can you have too much of either?) I used portobello mushrooms as suggested and the sauce came out very black but even for a person who doesn't like mushrooms, they weren't that bad. I agree with the reviewers who said that this is a good recipe to play around with. Overall, this was a really neat way to make chicken interesting. It was not hard at all since the ingredients are very basic. I used fresh basil from my garden and the aroma during the preparation makes your mouth water. I served the breaded breasts whole with a nice salad and basil garnish and it made a lovely summer meal. I used plain goat's cheese and did not find it too strong at all, in fact I hardly tasted the cheese. I will try it with feta next time for a variation. This is a must try dish and I look forward to other suggestions for the filling.

Elegant and easy. My whole family enjoyed this, even the kids. Just make sure the chicken is flattened as much as possible to cut down on cooking time.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I used thinly sliced chicken breasts so I didn't have to worry about pounding. I also added a slice of proscuitto to each breast. I don't really see the point of the bread crumbs, I think it would have been better to just skip them. And next time I won't bother to cut the chicken like roulades--it just looked messy. I made the sauce with baby portabellos and Madeira and did not add any of the butter at the end. It was delicious but very sweet--I'm not sure if Madeira is the best choice to compliment the chicken. All in all, a good dish to be played around with.

I thought this recipe was quite good and fun to play around with (such as adding minced mushrooms to the goat cheese mixture). When making it tonight I was running low on goat cheese and found that pureed cottage cheeese worked as a good extender to make the mixture stretch without impacting the taste adversely (strange but true).

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, because I knew my husband wouldn't eat goat cheese. A friend of mine had recommended it made just like the recipe. Then she added spinach and said it wasd great too. So, I made it with Fontina cheese and fresh spinach and my husband loved it.

YUMMM! I would recommend brining your chicken after pounding- makes it exceptionally tender. Doubled for a dinner party of picky eaters....I made the mushroom sauce in advance trying to save time- must admit, I totally dumped it due to its disgusting/unappetizing gray color and decided not to retry it. Might have been my mushrooms, I'm not sure- but I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was outstanding- I used 1/2 goat cheese and 1/2 boursin herb/garlic just because I didn't know whether my guests would do straight goat cheese. I agree with the other reviewers, my chicken took more like 45 mins. to cook but was FABULOUS! I made a sauce using leftover goat cheese mixture, a little reduced white wine, heavy cream, and butter- it was tasty but not even necessary. Had two requests for the recipe, and one converted "goat cheese eater!" I will be making this again very soon!!!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe - as is and with various modifications. Definitely increase basil - I sprayed Pam on pan before baking. Even tho some of mine were a bit sloppy because chicken had torn a bit, they held together great without any string or toothpicks. A fun recipe to play with.A++++++

Rating: 4
I've made this twice and it turned out great both times. The second time I had the butcher slice the chicken breasts horizontally so each breast yielded about 4 slices so I didn't need to pound them. They rolled up to the size of a cigar and I didn't need string at all. I would recommend this because it was much easier than the first time. Also took others advice and added garlic, extra basil, and sun dried tomatoes to the stuffing and half and half to the sauce. My husband loved it!

Rating: 4
Wow - this was so good. I must confess, I made the recipe with almost no fat to reduce the calories. Chicken patted dry adheres to itself quite nicely - so no tying, no breading - though I am sure it is delicious with the breading. A little olive oil sprayed on the chicken prior to baking keeps it nice and moist. I also eliminated all of the butter from the sauce and used a little spray butter for flavor instead. (I hope no one is offended by this.) I can't wait to make the recipe again, according to directions, when I'm off this crazy diet!

Delicious. I am a beginner cook and found this recipe so easy to make. Forget the string, use toothpicks. I had the butcher slice 2 rather thick chicken breasts in half lengthwise so the pounding of the chicken was minimal. I doubled the basil leaves. Beautiful presentation.

DELICIOUS! I took a chance and made this as our New Year's Eve Dinner given all of the terrific reviews. I concur...triple the basil, added only one T cold butter to the sauce, added 1 T goat cheese to the sauce, doubled the wine to 1/2 cup, baked chicken for 30 minutes and 5 minutes under the broiler. It came out PERFECT. My husband, (not a goat cheese lover) thought it was excellent. Our guests raved. Thanks to all for the tips.

WOW! My husband had the day off today and offered to cook me a special meal of my choosing. I browsed here for a recipe and decided upon this one. It was wonderful! He served it with some steamed broccoli, roasted red potatoes, and a loaf of freshly baked French bread. I am sitting here relishing in the afterglow of my meal, LOL. I think what impressed me the most was that I thought for SURE my 5 year old daughter would scoff at the goat cheese, but she didn't! She actually said it was the best chicken she had ever tasted. Next time I'll be sure to double the mushroom-wine sauce.

This was wonderful!! We really enjoyed eating it and it was very easy to make. The only changes I made was that I added garlic in with the mushrooms for a little more flavor and finished the sauce off with a little goat cheese like some other reviewers suggested. Can't wait to make this for a dinner party!!

Rating: 3
An easy weekday dinner meal that is even a bit impressive. One comment is that this dish can EASILY be made with less than half the butter called for. I drizzled about half of what it called for on top of the chicken before baking USed abotu an 1/8 of a stick to butter the pan to saute the mushrooms, and maybe 1/4 of a stick mixed with flour and cornstarch to make a roux and thicken the sauce. Delicious!

Rating: 3
I thought this was an excellent recepie. I did not use the string to tie my chicken rolls, instead as I completed each one I rolled it in a piece of Saran Wrap and then chilled until I was ready to cook them. Then I rolled and coated them and they stayed tightly rolled. I added a little wheat germ to the breading for extra texture. I warmed the leftover for lunch the next day and I think it was even better!

I make this dish regularly. I change the stuffing around every time though. Last night I stuffed the breasts with a mixture of spinach, feta, toasted pine nuts, sun-dried tomato, grilled chopped onion, and seasoned with salt, pepper and nutmeg. I made the same wine sauce but instead of mushrooms I sauteed some sliced kalamata and green spanish olives instead, to make it more mediterranean. I love playing around with this recipe, it turns out fabulous every time.

This was SENSATIONAL! And I made it for a large group that went nuts for it! Highly, highly, highly reccommended! The only hitch was I used string to hold the chicken together and it baked into the chicken and was hard to remove so I reccommend something else but I don't know what!

This recipe was easy to make and delicious.

I just love this recipe! I made this dish originally as it reads, but have since mixed up the stuffing part of it for larger parties for variety as some don't like cheese, etc. I have included prosciutto and roasted peppers, as an example - with and without the goat cheese. Always a hit!

This was FANTASTIC! I made it for a dinner party of 12 people and served it with sauteed string beans. This was the hit of the night! It is loaded with butter so I might cut that down just a bit next time. Definitely add more basil and scallions to the goat cheese - I did and it packed a punch. Also, I used pre pounded chicken cutlets so i took them out of the package, rinsed and rolled and it was worth the few extra dollars - especially with a 12 person dinner - time is precious when you're doing 5 courses. One last thing...make sure you have all the string out - it bakes into the chicken and becomes hard to find! :)

Very tasty. I doubled the filling and doubled the sauce. I found no need for string; I just wrapped the chicken around the filling and packed it like a snowball. It stayed closed just fine.

I substituted finely chopped red onion for the scallion - and made as directed. The chicken was fantastic. Rolling was very easy and makes for beautiful presentation to impress guests. Buy the thinly sliced breasts in the supermarket - less punding, and tie only down center - won't disturb breading. The mushroom sauce seemed a little rich with all that butter, might find something to substitute that next time, but overall very good!

I did not roll the chicken breast as I didn't want to disturb the breading when removing the string. So, I made a pocket for the stuffing, splitting the chicken breast across, did the egg wash and breadcrumbs. Buttered my pan, put in the chicken breasts, dotted it with very small amounts of butter. Cooked it for 10 minutes more than the recipe directed. It was superb!!! Very easy! Looked wonderful! And, tasted even better. Sauce was made as directed. Terrific!

Rating: 4
great dish - easier than it sounds - when i was unable to pound the chicken breast to the acceptable thickness, I shaved bits of it off to make rolling easier. I also secured with toothpicks, which worked great. Definitely add sundried tomatos, and I also suggest, as someone else did in the review, using flavored goat cheese. I used a basil and garlic flavored variety.

Rating: 2
this was fun to prepare, but the zing i wanted just wasnt there, plus it was hard to pound the chicken breasts into anything that could be rolled convincingly. if i cooked it again, i would augment it with peccarino-romano or garlic. it also needed way more than 20 minutes to cook, but that could be my oven. The sauce was less than remarkable as well; basically butter, wine, and mushrooms, which sounds crisp and nice but was sort of blah.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. I probably used about 4 or 5 large basil leaves and 3 green onions in the cheese mixture for added flavour. Instead of all the butter, I whisked in a mixture of cornstarch and cold water. I also added alot more chicken stock and wine to the sauce and let it reduce longer. As well, I placed the chickens seam side down and didn't string them or use toothpicks. I cooked for 30 minutes and them broiled them for a couple of minutes to give them some colour.

Served with rice pilaf and spinach with a squeeze of lemon. Won rave reviews from my husband.

The meat pounding and tying were a pain, but the flavors of the cheese, basil, green onion, topped w/mushroom sauce was really good. I didn't feel like going out to the store to buy goat cheese, so I used feta and didn't salt the mixure as much as called. It took longer than 20 minutes to cook through--more like 35- 40 mintues.

More trouble than it was worth with all the tying and such. The mushrooms sauce was good, but with all that butter what else would you expect?

I went to mix in my chesse with the green onions and basil and noticed my Goat cheese was moldly, so I had to improvise. I had to use grated parmesan cheese, but it turned out great. I took the suggestion of adding a slice prosciutto in the chicken. Be sure to use fresh basil to get the basil taste and roll the chicken from the long side, more like folding. I used a chipolte cream sauce instead of the mushroom. I will make this again with the Goat cheese. Good stuff.

Next time we'll pound the chicken thinner than 1/4 inch because it was difficult to roll and it took nearly double the 20 recommended minutes to cook through! The flavors were great together. Mushroom sauce was good, although we added a little more wine and chicken broth to make it go a little further ... and we only put 1 TBSP of butter in at the end rather than 4. Don't think it need any really. Served it all over orzo pasta. It was delicious!!

I don't care what anyone says. This recipe is devine! Easy to prepare & great for guests. Reminded us of a wonderful meal we had at Jean Paul's in Sanibel. Made subtle changes to make more healthy. Used light boursin cheese & substituted 3 T. Benecol, 1T. butter in the sauce. Bland? I don't think so! Watery sauce? Maybe it wasn't reduced enough before you added the butter.

Unfortunately this wasn't very good. A great dish is more than the sum of its parts, but this was just chicken + goat cheese + green onions. Basil was undetectable. Just okay, not for company. The green onions are really strong and could be left out altogether. The sauce didn't impress me at all. A better, similar sauce is with the prosciutto stuffed pork tenderloing on this site. That whole recipe is fabulous

This was wonderful, although (so bite me!) I did make a couple of changes. I layered some prosciutto over the cheese mixture along with some freshly roasted red pepper. I used panko crumbs rather than bread crumbs. The sauce is divine.

HUGE hit at my house. I plan on making this again and again. I followed the recipe exactly, served it with wild rice and fresh steamed asparagus tossed in lemon juice. My husband raved, and I was even sort of proud of it. (And I'm very self-deprecating about my cooking.) Highly recommended!

Very tasty! Changes: Used boursin cheese as others suggested (never had goat cheese before...). Lightly salted chicken breasts before filling. Also added garlic and vidalia onion to the sauce, and used less butter (1 tbsp instead of 4 in the last step). Next time will add some heavy cream to the sauce to thicken.

This is a keeper!! I used leeks and boursin instead of green onions and goat cheese ~ for a picky eater at our table...... It was delicious! Very simple, and a pleaser for not very experimental palates! The mushrooms were great! (My one year old son is currently inhaling the leftovers...)

I made this for my husband and I this evening because our 11 year old daughter was not going to be home and I was unsure if she would like goat cheese since I never made anything with it before. It was so delicious that I would definitely make it again when she was home. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain and did not find the mushroom sauce too rich at all, but I am use to cooking with a lot of butter and cream on a regular basis. I served it on top of white rice and made a salad as well.

This is a great dish! I didn't have enough goat cheese so I added some regular cream cheese (Boursin would also work well too) and a regular yellow onion instead of the scallions. It was still delicious. The mushroom sauce really compliments the chicken and cheese perfectly. My husband raved about it for days. I'm already making for a second time in a month. A keeper!

Me and My husband loved this. THe kids, Not so much. I think the goat cheese is a bit strong, though they ate it fine on crackers as I was making dinner. Maybe my kids just won't eat. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used the flour route and folded it like chicken kiev. It turned out really well and We liked the mushroom sauce too. it was mild, but not bland.

This dish was delicious. Instead of using bread crumbs, I dredged the chicken in flour and lightly browned it in butter before baking. I made the sauce in the same pan and the flour helped to thicken the sauce. I served this at a dinner party and everyone raved.

The first time I made this I didn't have all the correct ingredients, but improvised with great success! I used blue cheese and stilton instead of goat cheese.

Oh well, I seem to be the only one here who thought this dish was disgusting. Worst recipe I've ever gotten off of Epicurious so far. The chicken rolls tasted like glorified Shake N Bake, and the "sauce" was too thin and runny. I couldn't even taste the basil in the cheese. Won't bother with this one again.

Rating: 3
This dish is wonderful. So tender!!! I did change the recipe some though...I mixed the bread crumbs with the goat cheese, basil and also added the egg to that mixture, put this on the chicken and rolled each breast up. I did not tie the ends or use toothpicks, it is not neccessary. I cooked it for 15 minutes, while the sauce was cooking. Then I poured the sauce over the chicken and cooked for another 20 minutes. The sauce did seem a little thin so I added flour, covered and cooked 5 more mins. It was soooo good. I would deffinitely cook again!!

This is fabulous. I too make it without the sauce sometimes, and it is just great and so easy. My company loved it!!!!

Rating: 4
I've made this without the sauce, and the chicken itself was just wonderful. I instead use tomato sauce, or something with a mild acidity to offset the goat cheese. The trick is to pound the chicken flat enough to be easily rolled - this allows you to keep the cooking time to a minimum, thus keeping the chicken juicy. Overcooking is the easiest way to mess up this dish.

Just one word - wonderful!!!!

Great dish! I also used feta. To save time and effort, I just rolled the chicken, no toothpicks or string, and drizzled a little olive oil on top. Then I generously sprinkled the (Italian seasoned)breadcrumbs on top and patted them in a bit. My husband RAVED about this dish! (he never knew the difference) Definitely cook 35-40 min. Double the sauce and forget all that butter! You do not need it. Did add 1T of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. Enjoy!

I made this dish for a dinner party for 8. Everyone loved it. The best part was that I made it ahead of time so I was able to enjoy my company. I served it with asparagus and stuffed baked potatoes.

After reading the reviews and hearing that so many thought the wine sauce was bland, i decided to substitute a dry red wine for the white wine and was very pleased with the results. I also baked the chicken for 1/2 an hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered.

My expectations were apparently too high after reading all the reviews. The wine sauce was bland and had too much butter! It did not seem to compliment the chicken well. I think the chicken was good, however I would cut down to one onion and add more basil and serve it with a different sauce. This was not, in my opinion, a restaurant quality dish!

Rating: 3
Overall a pleasing dish. I agree at the wine sauce was a bit bland, but the mushrooms add a nice textural contrast to the breaded chicken. If you plan to use the wine sauce, I suggest doubling the recipe as others have. Or, instead of the wine sauce, try a light, thin pesto sauce over the chicken and serve with a side of pasta: the chicken stays quite moist during the baking process and is *not* dry without the wine sauce. I found that tying the rolls with string was unnecessary on both occasions on which I made this dish, and also found that instead of sliced into rounds, it's just as pleasing to serve in roll form (think chicken cordon bleu or kiev).

Rating: 4
I had a dinner party and this dish was fabulous! It looked very elegant served on the plates. Everyone wanted the recipe. One review I read commented on how her husband doesn't like goat cheese and he loved this dish. I don't like goat cheese either and this was delicious. Agreed with some to double, even triple the mushroom sauce. Also agree, 20 min cooking time is crazy. I baked mine for 40 min, uncovered and it was perfect. Also didn't have the twine and tooth picks worked just fine.

My wife said she was sick of baked chicken breasts so I searched the site. Luck would have it I had leftover fresh basil and mushrooms from an italian gravy I made earlier in the week and an unopened container of goats cheese! This recipe is fantastic. Not nearly as overwhelming as your typical stuffed chicken breast. One note... I think that 20 mintues is a joke for cooking time... I had mine in for about 45 minutes. When I prepare this again I think I will cook for 30 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered.

I made this recipe for my friends,as the main dish of a gourmet dinner I was hosting, and they absolutely loved it! So did my family, since I tested it on them first. It's quite time consuming, but I saved time by putting the mushrooms in the food processor. Since goat cheese isn't a favorite, I use plain or sundried tomato feta cheese--it's tasty!

I made this for a dinner party recently, the guests raved over it. I found it a bit rich, the green onions in the filling seemed to over power the goat cheese and basil combination. I was pleased with the reaction of my dinner guests, but I was disappointed with the meal myself. I think next time I would fill the chicken with a different mixture of cheese. I also think that I could have skipped the bland wine sauce on the side, it didn't add much to the over all flavor of the chicken.

There are so many reviews of this dish, that you really don't need mine! But after trying this, I just had to. It is sooo excellent. Next time I'll make more of the sauce though. Too much butter? Not if you're from Wisconsin! Just don't eat like this everyday and you'll be fine! My husband isn't that crazy about goat cheese (like I am) and he loved this dish. Can't wait to make it for guests. Really, you gotta give this dish a try!!

Rating: 3
Delicious, but I'm gonna modify it. Ten tablespoons of butter for four servings seems a bit excessive. I'd normally only use 1-2 tbls to saute the mushrooms, and the 4 tbls over the rolled breasts didn't really help them brown much and also seems excessive. I also didn't think the breast really needed the sauce, though it was still good. They had enough flavor on their own. The sauce would work great over simple sauted breasts though.

Wonderful recipe. It took about 35 minutes to cook, not 20. I took the advice of other posters and eliminated the extra swirl of butter. It was fine.

I thought this was a good recipe. I made it with veal cutlets because we had them on hand and it was great. I did leave out some of the butter in the sauce and because of that I don't think it came out as it should have. I think next time I will make this either with veal or chicken again but I will use the Mushroom Gravy recipe also on this sight (this is a great sauce/gravy recipe and does not call for nearly as much butter)

I loooove this recipe. It's easy and totally delicious. Refrigerating the rolls for a few hours definitely prevents cheeze ooze, and the presentation is so nice when the rolls are sliced and fanned. i also prefer string to toothpicks-- i find that toothpicks can be hard to pull out and sometimes hard to find.

I'm not sure what to say about this dish. While the breasts and the sauce were both good, I thought the combination was odd. Maybe my sauce wasn't "sauce-y" enough or something, but I just found putting them together awkward. Also, I thought there was WAY too much butter. My husband LOVED it, but I doubt I'll make it again.

My printer was out of action on my computer so I made this dish running back and forth between the kitchen and the computer room. As a result I got some wires crossed. I didn't have fresh basil, so I added what I thought was basil...It was oregano! I also added the breadcrumbs for coating the breasts to the filling the first time (I handgrated delicious sourdough bread)...And my husband hates goat's cheese so i substituted grated parmesan...Everything else was the same and the dish was fantastic!! My husband raved for days and wants it again. Next time though I'll try a different cheese and fresh basil.

My partner and I loved this dish! We did cut corners however, with no negative impacts! Rather that pound and roll the chicken we simply cut a 'pocket' in each breast, spread the goat cheese, sprinkled the sliced basil and then proceeded to dip in egg and bread crumbs before baking. Simple, gorgeous and delicious ( and the cheese did not melt all over the place as I had feared). Next time I will brown it for a minute under the broiler before serving. mmmmm

The meal consisted of: tomato/mozzarella/basil salad, the chicken with sauce spooned over bow tie pasta, asparagus, and the kahlua flourless chocolate cake also from this website. It was easy and delicious, the only problem was keeping the chicken closed over the cheese...but even though it was gooey it still tasted good...definitely classier than dining hall fare!

This dish is so easy and so delicious. I've made it about 4 times to rave reviews. One mistake...I didn't use unsalted butter and the sauce was way too salty. I also highly recommend buying chicken that is already flattened...saves a ton of time. And use toothpicks instead of twine.

Very nice. In answer to the question of how to keep the cheese in, I made sure the ends were well tucked in and that I had roold the ends well in the breadcrumbs, and didn't have a problem. Also, I let it set on a rack in the fridge for 1/2 an hour before cooking (as one would do for baking Chicken Kiev), and that helped. Next time, I'd like to try it with gorgonzola instead of the goat cheese, as I thought the goat cheese got washed away in the flavors of the sauce.

Very good. Also substituted feta cheese and used chives instead of green onions. I baked at 380 degrees for 35 minutes and used the broiler to brown it further. I am not sure I would make the sauce with it again, very rich and the rolls are already rich. Sauce was delicious, I used less butter, almost half what the recipe called for, total. I will not give a fork rating because I did make so many changes.

Good recipe, a great way to change it up. One question, how do you keep the cheese inside the chicken breasts from oozing out after cooking? I had to serve the rolled up breasts whole since I could not cut them, if I did there would be nothing left inside. Any suggestions? Thanks!

This is a GREAT way to make an elegant, tasty meal out of plain old chicken breasts. It's not too complicated, which is important for me...and it includes a very tasty mushroom/wine sauce which really puts this one over the top.

I think next time I'll serve it with garlic mashed potatoes.

This recipe was excellent. I made it for a friend and we both loved it. I grow basil in the summer and then puree in the food processer with a little olive oil and freeze it in ice cube trays. I used 2 "cubes" of basil for 4 chicken breasts, so that was probably 3 times what the recipe called for, but it was not too much basil for our taste. I did not bother with the sauce. I would most definitely make this again.

Served this for a dinner party and it was a real hit. I added strips of roasted red pepper to the filling and it worked well. The prep really wasn't that time consuming, except pounding the chicken, which seemed to take forever! I had to serve the breasts whole because the cheese was running out when I tried and I didn't have the chance to let them cool (and don't know if I would have wanted to do that anyway), but no one knew the difference and they still looked sufficiently "fancy." It's a rich dish -- I served it with a Stag's Leap chardonnay with which it married perfectly. Delicious!

I tested this recipe for an upcoming dinner party. This is an excellent dish - easy and very tasty. The chicken is very moist and the goat cheese is nice and creamy (melts in your mouth). I increased the basil and cut back on the butter in the sauce. No need to tie or toothpick the rolls together -- they managed to stay together on their own.

Rating: 3
This is a great dish for entertaining, since you can prepare so much of it in advance and it looks great. The classic goat cheese and chicken pairing works great with the basil (but you'll probably want to double the basil if you're a fan). Two more suggestions: If you have a powerful burner you'll do fine following the recipe to the letter. But our sauce also broke -- don't start to wisk in the butter until you've taken the chicken out.

Rating: 3
Like others I didn't make the sauce, and I substituted feta for the goat cheese (I've never had goat cheese & didn't want to hate my dinner if it wasn't for me!) and didn't need even toothpicks to secure the chicken - it stayed on its own. Altogether a delicious pairing. My originally skeptical boyfriend wants it again soon!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I had trouble's finding the string when it came to removing it when the chicken was cooked. I had the meat department of my local grocery store double tenderize my chicken, to save me from having to do it. And along with the cheese mixture, I added some other cheese. Other than a few personal alterations, I think this is a really good concept. It kind of get's me in the mood to stuff chicken breasts with just about anything.

I've made this recipe a few times now. A suggestion to those who find the sauce too thin/runny... be sure to let it reduce down as the recipe suggests. And, even if you choose to cut the amount of butter (which I recommend), save a portion of that butter to add to the reduction after it has been removed from the heat. The addition of the cold butter will thicken the sauce considerably. If you reheat it after this step, the sauce will separate and become thinner.

Preparing the chicken in advance would be a tremendous time saver, but even without I managed to have it on the table one-half hour after starting. I served it on a bed of brown rice; a combination of wild rice and brown rice would have been even better. This was a big hit with the whole falmily-husband and two picky teens. A definite keeper!

I made this chicken for a dinner party made up of 5 very critical gay men with big appetites, and the reviews were all great! One of them said this was the best chicken he had ever had. I doubled the recipe and there were no left-overs. I followed the instructions excatly - but used toothpicks to hold the chicken together and I don't think I let the sauce reduce quite enough. I am making this dish for my parents this weekend and will try to prepare the chicken ahead of time so I can really concentrate on the mushroom sauce this time. I've given this my best friend and she said she and her husband LOVE it! Try it!!

The mushroom sauce is awesome. The goat cheese filling is just okay; it was a bit too intense for me even though I like goat cheese. A decent recipe altogether, and I'll definitely be making the mushroom sauce again.

Great! I couldn't find goat cheese, so I subbed w/cream cheese, also added sundried tomatoes. I used skewers instead of twine (twine pulls off the coating) and baked for 30 minutes. Served with wild rice and a salad, family loved it!!!

I made this last night and was very disappointed with the results. I used plain chevre, but the culprit seemed to be the green onions. The dish was very bitter tasting. It was certainly not worth the effort to make this. My husband thought it was horrible. Make the Parmesan chicken from epicurious instead. And if you must make this, use garlic instead of green onions.

Rating: 2
I made this because I had all the ingredients for the chicken in the house. I didn't make the sauce for lack of time and ingredients, but it also seemed like it would be too much and mask the flavor of the goat cheese. I added sundried tomatoes to the filling, didn't secure the rolls with string or anything, they remained perfectly rolled and came out very pretty. They tasted pretty good, too, but goat cheese is pretty much my favorite thing so it couldn't possibly taste bad. However, this is serious girl food. I would probably only make this again for a group of ladies who only like white meat. I think baking chicken sort of dries it out (20 minutes seemed too long even though I had large chicken breasts) and I usually only do it with dark meat. Maybe the sauce makes up for that? Anyway, not bad, but I prefer my goat cheese on pasta.

A very tasty and easy dish to prepare. I used Herbed Boursin cheese, as suggested, and lots of basil "chiffonad-ed". The filling tasted very intense before cooking, but mild in the chicken. My suggestion would be to make sure the filling is Very, Very intense, otherwise it will taste lackluster in the chicken. I will add minced shallots instead of green onions next time. The sauce is the consistency of an 'a jus', but very tasty (I used half the butter and it was just right). Toothpicks worked nicely to secure chicken. I tripled the recipe and froze the rest for future meals. FYI-months later the meal was fabulous out of the freezer!!!!!

These were good for a buffet dinner. Use toothpicks instead of the string- much faster! Fine as leftovers too.

This recipe is deceptively delicious. It is also the kind of recipe that you can use as a jumping off point. I also made the dish several hours ahead and let everything meld together. Very easy ... put it in the oven and 20 minutes later ... yum. I made it with the Scalloped Fennel and Potatoes. What a combination!

Absolutely wonderful! I've used this a number of times with different guests, and they've all loved it! I've subsituted feta for the goat cheese for a more intense flavor, and i leave the chicken in a roll, rather than cutting it. The mushroom sauce is very rich, and i usually make extra! My favorite recipe so far from epicurious.

I've made this dish twice now. My wife agrees that it is the best recipie that I've made. Fresh basil, mixed with goat cheese is absolutely heavenly. I haven't had the problem with it cooking through, but I usually pound the chicken quite thin so that it cooks quickly and only use fresh(non-frozen) chicken.

I thought this so-so; the sauce was very heavy and next time I would use less butter. I agree that it took much longer to cook the chicken. I found my fiance loved it while I thought it was OK. I paired this with jasmine rice with basil and garlic; kind of funky but it worked well together.

The chiken is very tasty, however the sauce recipe needs some improvement. I added some dried porcini mushrooms along the standard white that the recipe calls for and some thyme and that improved the sauce considerably. Worth a try.

Great family dish. I would actually give it 3.5 if I could. Better than regular chicken but I do agree that it is a bit too much butter for a somewhat healthy diet. It gets really rich with the cheese and the butter...so moderation is good.

2 things I wouldn't forget and have been commented about before is to increase the cook time at least 5 more minutes and decrease the butter in the mushroom sauce. The recipe is easy and tasty, I am looking into a different recipe for the mushroom sauce although this one is pretty good, but a little too much butter :) Enjoy!!!

This recipe had all the things I love when entertaining - delicious, easy, make ahead. I served it at two events and all guests raved. Both times I served it over herbed spaetzle with spinach (great presentation) although I found the mushroom sauce to be somewhat uninteresting. I have other recipes for mushroom sauce that I will use next time. Great comments below: cook longer (I raised temp to 375 for last 5 minutes to brown off the top); options of chopped red pepper, minced jalapenos or use herbed goat cheese.

Wonderful, perfect to impress company or in-laws. Makes a nice presentation and is really very easy. I purchased the thin cut chic breats and really didn't have to pound out at all. I at least tripled the amount of basil and adding the roasted red peppers as suggested is a must!

this was good -- it would have been much easier had i had a better strategy on how to tie the chicken up, but besides all the mess i made -- the little chicken rolls came out nice. i am not much into chicken and probably would serve this only at a very casual get together. it is too much trouble for just a family night thing but breasts of chicken are not fancy enough for a nice dinner.

Elegant and easy. I loved the recipe, but next time I would want to try something with more zip. Maybe substitute minced chipotles or pickled jalapenos for the basil and scallions. Like an earlier suggestion, I reduced to butter to saute the mushrooms, but used the full amount of cold butter to finish the sauce. I used cremini mushrooms, but shitake would be good, too.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I have given it 3 forks because it was easy to make and tasted good enough but it didn't receive the raves that I expected. It did take a little longer to cook than indicated and thanks to all the previous reviewers who mentioned it, I was prepared. I doubt I'll make this again. It just didn't impress me or my guests as I had hoped.

Had to make this after it had been on the preferred list for so long, and the fresh basil from the garden was about to freeze out. Made as specified except for the bread crumbs. We had some left from the Gourmet Fig, Rosemary, Pancetta recipe, and they were marvelous. Small red potatoes were the staple and the sauce was great with them. Rice or Orzo would be our usual choice, but out of one and just had rice two nights in a row. Terrific flavors, and upon reading reviews, I see other cheeses could be used although we enjoyed the Montrachet. I would like to try it with a blue cheese, and my spouse would like some Mozzarella, not to be. It would be great for a dinner party because of the ease of preparation, and the dominance of the main course will make the side dishes simple and straightforward. First 4 fork recipe for us.

I fixed this recipe last night and my husband raved about it. Said it was "stupendus"!! I used Feta cheese (YUMMY!) which I had on hand and I increased the fresh basil a little. I also chopped fresh basil (about a full tbsp.) and added to the mushroom sauce along with the juice from a half of a lemon just prior to serving. The lemon and basil really complimented the great flavors of the butter, wine and mushrooms. I served with with rice and asparagus. It was a GREAT meal. One note: I used the toothpicks and found them difficult to remove after baking. Next time I will use my stainless turkey scewers which have a little bend at the end - something to get ahold of. This recipe is a keeper!

Made this last night for just two, used half the recipe for the chicken and made the full recipe for sauce. I only made a few small changes: toothpicks instead of string to secure the breasts; less butter in the sauce; baby bellas instead of button mushrooms; cooked the chicken forty minutes. I beat my breasts severly, yet they still needed additional time. My husband exclaimed that this was the best chicken recipe so far and he wants it again "right away!" For the prep time, this qualifies as an easy dish, yet tasty and impressive enough for company. I served it with steamed rice mixed with fresh spinach and we never even used the fresh batard that I had to go with. Wonderful! 5 forks!!

Rating: 3
Really quite good. Though I overcooked the chicken based on some recommendations that the time alloted wasn't enough. Guess it depends on how thin you pound the chicken. Next time will definately follow the recipe! I served this on a bed of baby spinach (first tossed with some of the mushroom sauce, just to wilt) and poured the remaining sauce over top. A side dish of pasta with butter and mustard seeds was the perfect accompaniement. I'll definately make this again, maybe experiment with some other flavours of cheese.

I made this one for my sister's birthday, and she loved it! I left out the sauce though, it really was tasty enough without it. Next time I would avoid telling my mother it was goat's cheese though -I don't think she'll let me make it for her again!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but made a few changes to enhance the flavors and reduce the amount of butter. I altered the mushroom sauce by using portobello mushrooms, a shallot, vermouth instead of white wine and low fat sour cream to thicken the sauce. The chicken recipe remained the same with the exception of the bread crumbs. I am allergic to wheat flour so I substituted using corn bran. I found it tasted great and easier to digest. I would definitely make this recipe again.

What an unusual blend of summer and fall flavors. Being the fan of basil that I am, I was, to say the least, liberal with my measurements and thought it helped lift the flavor of the goat cheese. I used portabella mushrooms in the sauce and loved the result, but felt I didn't have enough so will make more next time. And in response to the other responses, I too needed just a few more minutes in the oven.

The recipe was delicious. My wife and son loved it.I didn't have mushrooms so I made a simple veloute sauce made from homemade chicken stock, and flavored it with tarragon. If one were to substitute feta cheese for the Montrachet (as some readers have suggested), I would mash it well with a fork, and soften it with some white wine, so that it is easier to spread on the chicken. If you are using fairly thick chicken breasts, cutting a pocket in the meat, adding the herbed cheese, and securing the open end with toothpicks, works well.

From my point of view, this recipe was a bust. The chicken breasts were half-raw at 20 minutes, still underdone at 40 minutes, and rubbery at 60 minutes. The Montrachet ran and was watery; the recipe had none of the strong, robust flavor I associate with goat cheese. There is enough butter here to turn an otherwise wholesome recipe into a heart attack on a plate. I cut waaaaaaaaaaaay back. But even so, I'd have to say that a buttery mushroom and wine sauce is not a flavor I'd pick to go with goat cheese and basil. A tomato concasse would be more my style. Very disappointed because this sounded good-- but I won't be making it again.

I made this for my husband on a Tuesday night, but it ended up being more of a Saturday night-type of dish. We both absolutely loved it!

The chicken came out perfectly as did the sauce. Now I am waiting for company so I can make this again!

we made this for 14 people...went over very well, easy to prepare in advance...used many recommendations seen below (e.g., sundried tomatoes, roasted red pepper sauce, more basil, more flavorful cheese than simple montrachet, etc.) we must have pounded our breasts just perfectly because it truly did take only 20 minutes. Skipped all the butter in the sauce--not necessary, esp. if you use flavorful Portabella mushrooms. A real winner.

Where did they get this from, the Ladies Home Journal??? Eewww!! This recipe is largely uninspired and unintegrated by design. It fails to juxtapose interesting ingredients in unique ways, and uses traditional ingredients in ways that are only moderately appealing or less. (what were they thinking...) As a whole, the dish is far too fattening for such flatly disappointing flavor and there isn't much satisfaction or richness added by all of that fat. The sauce would be immeasurably better served on a plain roasted chicken breast, and the filling is a wholly monochromatic entity flagrantly reminiscent of the scallion cream cheese more appropriately served atop a good bagel. In any case, it is a real waste of good goat cheese... If you want a satisfying stuffed chicken breast recipe try 'Chicken Kiev-Style' from the book Jacques Pepin's Table. It is cheaper and more satisfying.

I thought the chicken was good, but not unbelievably delicious. I had to cook the chicken about 10 minutes more than the recipe called for and it still wasn't done as well as I would have liked it. The filling was OK, but I thought it needed a little more "oomph". The mushroom-wine sauce was delicious, however,and that's with cutting the butter swirled in in half. My children ate it, so I probably will make this dish again, but I was a bit disappointed with the results after reading all the rave reviews.

Three cheers to the "Cook from S.F. (6/22/01)". The celery is a brilliant idea, though I found that it worked better if I didn't pound it flat and instead used the handy hollow part of the stalk as is. Also, I cleaned the celery by removing the leaves and tough stringy part. My girlfriend raved about it and even the dog lapped it up, and he usually turns up his snout at celery!

I've made this dish twice--once for my family and once for special guests, and both times it was a very big hit. The only change I made was to make twice as much sauce as was called for, and used chopped portabellas which I thought worked wonderfully. I served this with Gnocchi in Mushroom Sauce, which can also be found on this site, and the two went together as if made for each other. Also made that dish with half portabellas and half shitakes. Those two recipes together make one of my favorite meals yet.

This one went in the Favorite Recipe File!!! The chicken turns out so tender. Add none of the extras others have recommended and find it very tasty. Mushroom sauce doesn't really "go" with the chicken but it tastes so good why pass it up? I also find the rollup process messy at best and I don't cut up the rolls when done but instead serve as a bundle for each plate. Delicious with wild rice!!!

Excellent! However, the sauce isn't quite right for the chicken. Maybe Madeira wine instead of white wine. Add extra basil to stuffing. Yummy and easy!

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't use goat cheese as my husband is not fond of it. However I used Boursin ( 50% low fat with chives) and added twice the amount of basil and the twice amount of roast peppers as previously suggested. I didn't tie and toothpick each roll, instead I spread each pounded cutlet with cheese, etc. and rolled to seam. Put seam side down in "Pam" spread glass pan and cooked for 20 minutes. Put extra cheese "pat" & 1/4 of a pat of butter on each roll and cooked for said time as previously suggested.20 min+) An excellent meal for everyone.

Rating: 4
I thought this was great. I followed others advice and added bottled sweet roasted red bell pepper to the stuffing. Be warned that the rolling up process is not as easy as they make it sound! I liberally used string and tooth picks. I also used packaged bread crumbs with herbs. Delicious. I would also recommend the gratin of goat cheese and garlic potatoe recipe with this.

After eating the entire meal, my boyfriend decided that he "doesn't like" goat cheese. (Note: its' not like there was ANYTHING left on his plate!) He suggesteed using provolone instead which would be an entirely different recipe altogether. Anyway -- I, on the other hand, thought it was delicious. I added sun-dried tomato pesto to the cheese mixture and cut down on the butter in both the sauce and over the chicken. I'll definately make this again, just not for the boyfriend.

Rating: 3
The recipe was excellent, and fairly simple for a novice cook like me. The fresh basil is great, but there may still have been something missing in the filling... I'd add sun dried tomato or roasted pepper next time. The sauce seemed unnecessary, but the mushrooms were great by themselves. crimini, sauteed in butter, add dry white (i used chardonnay) and reduce. stop there, and try the mushrooms... incredible flavors.

To save time cut pocket in chicken breast and stuffed with Boursin cheese wrapped in slice of ham. Seared chicken and then simmered in a bit of chicken broth until cooked through (10-15 min). Sauteed some finely chopped onion and sliced shitake and button mushrooms, deglazed with a bit of sauvignon blanc and chicken broth. Delicious and very quick. Used only a tiny bit of butter. Served with spinach sauteed with garlic and olive oil. Will definitely make again!

This is the best way ever to prepare chicken. The cheese mixture provides more than i felt should be spead on the chicken, so it could be cut back a bit. Extra goat cheese may be dipped in egg and bread crumbs, fried lightly and added to fresh greens tossed with vinegar and oil and kosher salt.

This recipe is delicious! Epicurious has given my family SUCH delightful new foods. Pounding those chicken breasts is tricky for me, though; I tore one of them but I think it's an art I need to master...I will take one reviewer's advice and ask the butcher to do it next time and next time will be soon...I will present this dish for my in-laws when they arrive for our son's high school graduation.

This is simply fantastic. I enjoyed cooking the chicken stuffed with Boursin cheese in the sauce (white wine, stock, mushrooms, etc.), rather than roasting it. Everyone raved about it. Well worth making.

I agree...You don't really need the sauce. I know this is changing the recipe somewhat, but I found feta cheese with peppercorns that could take the place of the goat cheese, and substitute spinach for the basil to make it a greek dish.

I have made this a number of times, and my roommate and I love it. I leave out the basil because it gets overpowered by the scallions anyway, and don't bother with the mushroom sauce. The butter on top of the chicken is unnecessary, and it tasted better without it. This dish is extremely easy to make--I can prepare it in about 15 minutes w/o the sauce.

I MADE THIS DISH FOR SOME FRIENDS AND IT WAS A TOTAL HIT ALL AROUND. IT DEFINITELY TAKES TIME TO PREPARE BUT IT WAS WELL WORTH THE EFFORT. OUR GUESTS CALLED IT "TRUE GOURMET".

This recipe is wonderful and I didn't use a DROP of butter! Once I got the chicken rolled up with the cheese mixture etc, I drizzled a little bit of olive oil around the rolls. Then I sauted the mushrooms in olive oil as well. This is a keeper!

To avoid the hassle of pounding, rolling and tying- cut a pocket in each breast from the side and insert the stuffing. You can close the opening with a toothpick. Also you might try rolling the cheese, basil, etc in a thin slice of prosciutto before putting it in the chicken- then you won't even need the toothpick and it tastes wonderful.

Rating: 4
i always ask my butcher to pound out my meat for me. friends in other towns find this service extraordinary, anyway, there's no harm in asking!i have made this twice. one time for a party of 15! the second time i refrained from drizzling butter on top to avoid the more moist result. i prefer the chicken more dry and offered the mushrooms on the side. i served the leftover cheese mixture with crackers. it was hit too! next time i will take another review's low fat tips and see what happens!

We tried this dish and then did something a bit different the next time. We first used someone's recommendation about putting Boursin cheese into the chicken and that was wonderful. Secondly, we did not bread the chicken (lowered the carbs kept it extremely diabetic friendly). We then seared the chicken in a skillet browning all sides, added some chicken broth and allowed it to simmer for 10-15 minutes until cooked through. After that we removed the chicken and kept it warm, deglazed the pan with wine (Sauvignon Blanc), and made the sauce without the mushrooms. It was an amazingly delicious dish. My husband felt it was something he would like me to cook every week.

Rating: 4
This was my first attempt at pounding out chicken in order to roll it, so the next time I make this I will be sure to pound the chicken as thin as possible without turning the meat to mush. However, the end product rated second helpings by all my guests. I would skip the mushroom sauce completely because all I ended up with after the addition of wine and stock, was soggy mushrooms with no taste. I did serve the chicken with a roasted butternut squash puree straight fromthe blender with just a little salt but no stock or cream. I also poured 1/4 cup butter over the chicken prior to baking and thought it came out wonderfully moist. This will be served again for sure.

Rating: 4
I've become a fan of gourmet.com and have made many of the dishes from here, but this is my first review. I loved this dish, but I made some changes to pump up the flavor and to greatly reduce the fat content. First, I added chopped roasted red peppers to the stuffing. I used only the egg white to dredge the meat before adding the breadcrumbs, and I added NO butter to the chicken. For the sauce, which was wonderful, I used 1/2 cup of wine and only 1 T of butter. I completely omitted the last 4 T of butter that the recipe called for. This recipe is really really easy to make (although rolling the chicken took a bit of talent), and had wonderful flavor. I'm already planning to make it again!

Rating: 3
After reading the dozens of reviews for this recipe and making it exactly as was called for, I would change the following next time: Add roasted pepper or sundried tomatoes to the filling, increase the amount of basil and cook for 25-27 minutes instead of the 20 called for (we live at 7,500 ft so I always have to cook things longer). The mushroom sauce is delicious, but totally unnecessary to add that much butter (and I'm not afraid to use a pound of butter if warranted.) Either omit butter at end or use cream as was suggested by another review. Fairly to easy to make, even for beginning cooks. Definately will make for guests, with the additions/ommissions.

Rating: 4
AWESOME! I just had a party for 50 people and this was one of the dishes served. EVERYONE commented on this dish and it was against some pretty stiff competition. I did change it however..I used roasted red pepper flavored goat cheese, left out the scallions completely and added a lot of sundried tomatoes. I used only 1/3 of the butter called for in the sauce and used more wine and stock, thickening it slightly with cornstarch, and used portobello mushrooms.

Rating: 3
I had this the other night. The next day I served the leftovers as an impromtu supper. Rave reviews. I changed the recipe to improve it: I used 3-4 scallions, more basil and used garlic & herb Montrachet. I rolled the Chicken breast in crushed black bean flavored nacho chips. For the sauce I used sliced shitake and oyster mushrooms, and added more wine and stock to the pan. When it cooked down I added some half and half to the pan instead of butter. I poured the sauce over the Chicken breasts. It was excellent - but I guess not really quite the same recipe that I started out with. I will make this on a regular basis - its fast and delicious.

OK, so first, I said I would make this recipe again only because I would CHANGE it. I agree with Tomi that the butter is so over-powering. I have a Restaurant and frequently use Beurre Blanc Sauces and don't get me wrong....I LOVE BUTTER SAUCES!!! But, The Chicken is good on its own...good, not great. I agree with the cook that I would add roasted red pepper. (More basil too) Then I would make the recipe exactly as stated only stop after the wine section...the mushrooms were outstanding! It didn't need more butter or the stock or anything else! (maybe a little salt and freshly ground pepper.) You know, I find so often that if I make a recipe out of Bon Appetit I can always count on success, yet on this sight, I have had several failures or disappointments. Who is posting the recipes? A cook who has tried it or someone from the magazine? I think I am giving up on this sight for good. Can anyone tell me where I can get unadulterated Bon Appetit Recipes online?

I've been making this dish since receiving the bon appetit in 1990! As a working mother of 3, I need easy prep. Chicken can be rolled in the a.m. and refrigerated. I bread the chicken first and then top with the cheese mixture (easier than toothpicks in eggs) and roll, placing seam side down. I add chopped sundried tomatoes to the filling and avoid the scallions. Great dish for dinner parties... little pre-dinner prep. For more "gourmet" look, slice into medallions and arrange on plate. Double the sauce recipe, add more wine and let mushrooms simmer to absorb flavor. They are a meal in themselves. Crowd pleaser every time

This recipie should come with a warning for heart patients; butter, butter, and more butter. Perhaps a better name for the sauce would be "Mushroom and Butter Sauce", since the amount of butter far outweighs the amount of wine involved. I admit, this dish was tasty, though not tasty enough to risk the cost of triple bypass surgery. The next time around I'll use a different sauce and add some more goodies to the filling --t

This chicken has become a "regular" on our weeknight meals list. It's relatively quick. My four children love it! We've experimented with the sauce a few times... last time we made the chicken without the sauce, but with slightly more goat cheese filling. It was wonderful!This dish has mild flavors, but it is still interesting with different textures.

Wow, what an elegant, absolutely delicious dish. Be sure to cook longer than 20 minutes or your chicken will be pink! I had the chicken breasts pounded quite thin too and 20 minutes was definetely not enough. Next time I will brown the breasts with the breadcrumbs before baking to add even more flavor. The sauce was heaven! Serve with rice pilaf and maybe some baby carrots.

This dish is full of flavor, and was not as difficult to prepare as I had anticipated. The chicken took longer to cook - 20 minutes was not enough time.

This was truly a delicious dish. I added chopped sun dried tomatoes to the goat cheese mixture for more flavor. In addition, the second time I prepared this recipe, I rolled the chicken breast starting from a short end, i.e. it made a much bigger roll, but it held together a lot better. Also much easier to roll up that way. The mushrooms are to die for. I just reduced the butter significantly, so that I didn't really get a sauce, but rather a "garnish". I served this with rice - goes together really well.

The only recipe that can make chicken breasts edible...and even positively delicious. Next time, I plan on cutting down the green onion by half and increasing the amount of basil. I agree with a previous cook that the sauce does not add much to a dish that is already so full of flavor.

i found this recipe easy, quick to make and quite tasty. i did bake for ~25 minutes, 5 more than the recipe called for. i think others who needed significantly more cooking time probably didnt pound out the breasts thin enough. we made a few changes. in lieu of breadcrumbs, we used japanese bread crumbs ("panko flakes") which are much lighter. they gave the chicken a great, crisp and light exterior...much more sophisticated than traditional breadcrumbs. also i agree with others that the filling can be a little bland for some tastes. i added more basil than was called for (actually used thai basil) and salted the mixture generously before spreading on chicken...a baked breast of chicken needs a healthy dose of flavor to keep it tasty! finally we used less butter than was called for. if the chicken is done right it'll be plenty juicy and flavorful on its own, and wont need to be dredged in a heavy butter sauce.

Great meal.Straight forward prep.Just enough for a family of four.Followed the recipe to the letter except I used garlic herb encrusted goat cheese and dry bread crumbs with cheese.I think those two substitutes helped the flavour.The result was outstanding, I highly reccommend this dish.Combine it with a Markham Savighuan Blanc wine...a little for the cook....a little for the sauce...yum!

This was good but I didn't think it was outstanding. The mushroom sauce was rather bland--I'd agree that a dijon sauce would be preferable (anything with more bite to it). I had to cook the chicken for almost 35 minutes, the last ten being at 400 degrees. Used Italian bread crumbs--plain would have been too dull. I don't think I'll make this specific dish again, it's a heart attack on a plate, but some variation thereof, sans butter.

I changed just about everything about this recipe because of absence of ingredients (used ricotta, shallots, parmesan and chopped spinach for stuffing) olive oil instead of butter and brushed on egg and crumbs instead of dipping. But the problem was that it wasn't cooked enough. I preheated and cooked 20 min., then "plated up, wild rice and squash puree nicely surrounding the pretty stuffed breast... which turned out to be pink inside. Icckk. I guess I would try again but am somewhat turned off the dish now...just thinking about that pink meat on my fork (shudder).

I used the split breasts secured with toothpicks and it came out really well. Definitely use sundried tomatoes in the cheese mixture. I also added a little dijon mustard to the egg mixture. After reading the other reviews I was concerned that 20 minutes wouldn't be long enough so I cooked it at 375 for just shy of 30 minutes and it was a bit over cooked. I think if you really preheat your oven well, 20 minutes may very well be enough. All in all this recipe is VERY easy and very good.

I was so surprised after reading the previous reviews, but this dish was "okay", not great. It was fun to prepare and great to make some of it ahead, but the flavors weren't "punchy" enough; it was rather bland. Perhaps I should have used extra basil as a previous reviewer suggested. The sauce was delicious. I think I'll use a different stuffing.

Made this last night with what I had on hand and in the little amount of time I had. It was just me and my husband, so it didn't need to be really pretty. I made the pocket in the chicken and with the goat cheese and green onions added sundried tomatoes, chopped prosciutto and Italian seasoning. Sprayed the tops of chicken with oil and added garlic, pepper and more seasoning. Made the mushrooms with one T. of butter only. Baked chicken for 30 min. and added the mushroom sauce to the chicken for the last 5 minutes. Made a side dish of penne regati with fresh spinach sauteed with olive oil and garlic, fresh tomato, a little cream and topped with fresh grated parmesan. Both dishes were very tasty and went well together. I cut up the left over chicken breast w/ stuffing and stirred it into the left over pasta and had it for lunch today. Very good on the second day.

My husband loved this recipe, but I just figured out that I do not like goat cheese. Used a mild brand too, Chavrie with basil and garlic. Whew, pretty pungent!

YUMMY!!! We loved the fact that it wasn't fried, but still had the nice bread crumb coating. There really is a lot of butter in this dish, though. If anyone has any ideas how we can cut the butter down, please let us all know! I served the mushrooms not as a topping for the chicken, but as a topping for the orzo I made as a side dish. I also agree with previous reviews that the temperature and cooking time need to be adjusted (we did 425 degrees for 25 min.).

Very tasty. I used Feta and cut down the amount of butter. I really liked the way the Feta flavored the dish. Using a cheese that isn't as flavorful would decrease the quality...

This was an excellent dish for the "beginner" cook. It was a relatively simple preparation with outstanding results. I cut back on the butter for the main dish and the mushroom gravy and it was fine. I also doubled the amount of mushrooms in the gravy. I cooked it for 15 minutes on 350 and an additionaly 15 minutes on 400, perfect. I prepared the dish in the morning and cooked it that evening and it was great! Enjoy!

Was delicious!! I would cook it longer though- I cooked it for 30-35 minutes.

Another rave review among many! An excellent, esay, make-ahead company recipe with a great presentation. I read all the comments first & used the following tips: Goat Cheese with herbs, Italian breadcrumbs, roasted red pepper strip over the cheese (before rolling), additional (fresh) basil & onion. I cut the butter to half for the sauce & only used 1T for sauteing the mushrooms. I always use a cooking spray. The sauce was fabulous!! The sauce is a must for dinner. Also, I'm going to try what one person suggested using the chicken as an appetizer. Maybe with a mild mustard dip/sauce?

This was awesome!!! I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese, I took the advice of some of the reviews and doubled the mushrooms and basil for the sauce. I also doubled the feta, green onions, and basil because I pounded out whole chicken breasts. I served it with "Near East Rice Pilaf" it was very tasty with the mushroom sauce. I just has some leftovers and I think it tasted better the next day. Next time I make this dish I will prepare the chicken and the sauce the day before to let the flavors blend. I also will not use whole chicken breasts again, the reason that I used them was because the market only had whole and I was much to lazy and excited to get home and start cooking to be wandering around town to find halves. Thank you Epicurious for this fine dish!!!

I made this dish almost the way it was called for, except used more fresh basil and instead of tying the chicken, I used small skewers. No problems with the cheese oozing. It used a lot of utensils & dishes to prepare, but that's what dishwashers are for. My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe the first time I made it as my husband even liked it cold. Definite "keeper".

I'd may make again in one version or another. Get the thickest chicken breasts you can, as cutting a pocket is no snap. Should really be made ahead and refrigerated, as that helps the coating stick. Also, I heated butter in baking dish and flipped chicken half way through, yet still needed broiler to brown-up coating.

We really enjoyed this dish, including the little ones here! I added a bit more fresh basil.

As other reviewers mentioned I added another 15-18 minutes in the oven. It was perfect and moist. Will make again. Thanks!

The chicken was so tender it was falling apart and the stuffing seasoned this perfectly. Even my friends who don't like goat chesse ate it (I used Feta) and it was a complete sucess!

I love the dish, but to cut down on prep time -- I simply slit a pocket into the chicken breast and stuff. Continue w/ breading and skipped the butter on top. No strings, fuss, or ooziness the Ft. Worth cook had. Tastes great too!

The review from " a cook from Fort Worth, Texas" says it all! I agree whole heartedly. This recipe is nothing special...not worth the labor intensive time.The sauce is much too fatening. All that butter is a turn off. The overall taste is flat. Very disappointing.

Okay, this has made it to my all time favorite list. We loved this dish! I used a Provencal style goat cheese that already had basil added, so I omited the fresh basil. I added some leftover fresh spinach leaves to the chicken breasts after spreading the goat cheese mixture as well. The chicken breasts didn't seem to cook all the way through using the recommended time and temperature, so I cooked it for 20 minutes on 350 and then increased the temperature to 400 for an additional 12 minutes. I sprayed the chicken breasts with "I can't believe it's not butter" spray once during cooking. It came out of the oven perfect and made the house smell wonderful.

I found several issues with this recipe. Pouring butter over the bread crumb coating produced a soggy crust. Stringing up the chicken was laborious and removing the strings after cooking removed portions of the crust. The basil and onions were over powered by the goat cheese - I didn't notice they were there. The mushroom butter sauce was good but hey what isn't that has a stick of butter in it. I don't think the sauce was a great match up for the strong flavor of the goat cheese. When slicing the chicken, the delicate melted goat cheese oozed out everywhere hindering presentation. Not a bad dish, but I think "the wonder of it all" was over stated.

Rating: 2
This didn't turn out as I expected it would. I took the suggestions of other reviews and made more sauce, but the sauce was disappointing and the chicken bland. It was better the next day as an appetizer, but I won't make it again. I have a much better Chicken Kiev recipe I'll stick with!

Absolutely fabulous. I have also made it with boursin cheese instead of the goat cheese and basil and liked it as well, if not better. Do make extra wine sauce for the mushrooms. In fact, make extra of everyting, it is wonderful chilled and thinly sliced the next day.

This is a great dish to make anytime but especially when entertaining because it can be made ahead and it's so flavorful you can serve it with plain rice and steamed vegetables. I use about half the butter that the recipe calls for and it's still out of this world!

I have made this twice now and it's going in my master recipe file! Good for guests, none of the flavors are too strong for sensitive eaters. Takes some time to prepare, I recommend stuffing the chicken breasts ahead of time if you are making it for company.

Excellent! Even though I had a few problems preparing the chicken (pounded too thin and fell apart and not having any string) I managed to put them together and they baked beautifully. The sauce was wonderful as well and I reduced it enough so that I didn't have to thicken it. It is even good as left-overs the next day!

Rating: 3
Very good chicken dish. I took the advise of other reviewers and used herb cream cheese, extra onions and basil and seasoned bread crumbs. I also added roasted red pepper, as it also was suggested by others, and hated it. It distracted from the other flavors in the cheese mixture. I should have taken the advise to make extra sauce.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I didn't make the sauce and it still tasted wonderful.

Rating: 4
I used a herbed goat cheese, a garlic and herb chicken broth, less butter, and a little flour to thicken the sauce. I also used Progresso parmesan seasoned bread crumbs, which added much flavor. I did not pour butter over the chicken before baking-I used Pam butter flavored spray, lightly, gave a good flavor, and also a crispy texture. I also use Crazy Janes salt and pepper, which is a blend-adds great flavor to everything. This was one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever tasted. I plan on serving it for guests next month. YUMMMMMMMMM.

If you don't have string, you can use dental floss to tie the chicken breasts!

Rating: 3
I chickened out (excuse the pun) of the stuffing/rolling business as it sounded daunting. Instead I cut a pocket in the chicken breast, stuffed it with the cheese mix, sewed it closed, and left out the breadcrumb coating. It was still delicious but having read the reviews I'll definitely try the recipe properly the next time. The sauce was absolutely gorgeous, even though I used low fat margarine instead of butter and only about half the quantity given in the recipe.

Rating: 4
Wow, I was really impressed by this dish. It was easy to prepare, and no worries with having it stay rolled together. I used italian crumbs and a combination of feta and cream cheese. And used 1/2 the amount of butter called for, and thickened the sauce with flour. Everything turned out PERFECT! This has been the best recipe I've tried so far off of Epicurious.

Rating: 2
This was good - particularly the sauce - but I agree with the cook who concluded that there are better things to do with a chicken breast. Easy to prepare but a bit labour-intensive for a week-night meal. We found there was a lot of washing-up - processor for breadcrumbs, dishes for dipping etc. Rolling up the breasts is easier if you pound them really thin. I used toothpicks to secure the rolls as I had no kitchen string. Cooking time certainly longer than stated (about 15 mins longer). Next time, I would season the filling a little more - perhaps use more scallions too - it seemed a tad bland.

Delicious!! Used Feta Cheese that was packed in oil and spices, so I didn't use any basil. The mushroom wine sauce was excellent!! A little time consuming but will prepare again!!!!!

The sauce for this recipe was Wonderful! It is so good, I think it can be used by itself on broiled or grilled chicken. The chicken in this recipe was also good by itself. In fact, it really didn't need a sauce at all. After making this recipe, I discovered that I don't like Goat Cheese. Next time I plan to substitute Cream Cheese for the goat cheese. I can't wait!

Really WONDERFUL way to cook chicken. I found the rolling it up a little messy, but don't let that worry you when your preparing it - it will still come out fine if you get it thoroughly breaded. I'm going to try it with veal, next time. I also used shitake mushrooms for the sauce, which was simple and delicious.

I made this for a dinner party of four. Everybody loved it and were very impressed. A little time consuming, but well worth it. I put a strip of roasted red pepper in the center as someone had suggested. It added to the presentation immensely.

What a fabulous dish. I followed everybody else's advice and baked the chicken for 27 min. this made all the difference. The mushroom sauce was great. I do think it should be doubled though. I served it over a wild rice and some asparagus on the side. You'll look like a gourmet in no time at all with this meal.

Made just the chicken portion of this recipe last night (as my wife finds mushrooms disgusting-unfortunate, because I love them) with some modifications. Mixed cream cheese with some herbed feta, didn't have any green onion (bet it would be good with shallots also), added Italian seasoing to the breadcrumbs, toothpicks worked fine. Thought another reviewer's idea for a sun dried tomato sauce was intriguing, so I whipped up a version with roasted red pepper. I intended to use the sauce for the meat, but wound up just using it on the side of pasta I made, because the chicken turned out fabulously. Can't wait for the leftovers tonight! Will make this one for my next dinner party.

Definitely a keeper!! Chicken needs to cook for 30 minutes for sure. Easy and delicious!

I made this for a get together and it was delicious!! Everyone asked for the recipe!! I prepared the chicken the night before and kept it refrigerated. I added extra basil and green onions, doubled the mushroom sauce for 4 chicken breasts, and used ricotta cheese instead of goat cheese. The cooking time needs to be increased by 10 minutes. I will definitely make this dish again!!

I agree that this is a must make! This dish is particularly good for a small group party since the chicken can be prepared ahead of time and requires little maintainence during cooking. The sauce was wonderful! Prepared this with a side side dish or Orzo w/lemon and rosemary. Delicious!

This is an outstanding dish. It is relatively easy to make and looks lovely on a plate. I read the reviews beforehand and agree that the chicken needs to be cooked longer (about 30 minutes total). I also watch the fat in recipes and thus sprayed the chicken with olive oil cooking spray instead of using the melted butter suggested. It worked very well. Also, I reduced the butter added to the mushroom sauce after cooking to one tablespoon and the sauce was plenty rich. I will make this recipe again.

Since no one in our family likes goat cheese, I took others' advice and substituted feta, which worked very well. The toothpicks also work well to hold the breasts together in lieu of string. The mushroom-wine sauce is excellent, and works well even by itself on chicken.

I made this dish last night for my husband. We both love goat cheese and this dish was wonderful. I served it on a bed of wilted spinach, which worked well with the chicken and mushroom sauce. Also, I used basil and roasted garlic goat cheese instead of plain goat cheese to give the filling more flavor. I would definately make this dish again.

Rating: 3
Very good dish as is, simply excellent with modifications. as said before, use all the filling and sauce for half the chicken breasts, to serve 2. for the chicken, use feta, thai basil leaves (stronger, mintier flavor), way more basil and scallions in the stuffing, and japanese breadcrumbs (panko). for the sauce, use quartered fresh shiitakes, sake, & beef broth, added in several stages, reducing greatly in between; when you remove the chicken from its pan to serve, pour the reduced sauce into the pan with an extra 1/4 cup sake, scraping up the browned bits and cooking down; lots of pepper, a dash of sugar, more freshly chopped green parts of scallions and basil finish the sauce just before you bring it to the table. served over a lemon-almond rice pilaf with sugar snap peas, this made an elegant and wonderful meal. note: cooking time for the chicken needed to be almost doubled.

I just made this dish for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Very simple to make! I used seasoned feta cheese instead of goat cheese and added rosemary to the mix. You definitely HAVE to double the wine/mushroom sauce. I followed the recipe and it made so little it was embarrassing passing the dish around (I put a really small serving spoon in it!). I didn't have any kitchen string in the house so I used toothpicks to keep it together and that worked fine. I also cooked it for about 15 minutes longer than called for. I will make it again and again.

I'm a huge food snob and this dish was absolutely fantastic!! If you don't mind taking the time, it is well worth the effort. A very impressive entree.

I have made this wonderful dish numerous times and it never gets old!

The sauce was excellent and I usually double it--didn't use as much butter as it called for. Delightful dish!

I think it makes a nicer preparation. A good company dish.

We loved this dish! After reading the other reviews, I decided to skip the sauce all together- I was feeling lazy. I'm very glad I did, for the chicken had plenty of flavor without anything else. I used Italian breadcrumbs and cooked it for longer than called for. It was perfect!

I don't use the word "delicious" very easily. But this recipe rates very well among my collection. It was also very elegant, a dish to serve when you want to impress. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used Feta cheese, seasoned my eggs with salt/pepper and sprinkled salt on the breaded chicken before baking. So succulent! Add a little egg to the butter sauce for body.

i had a wonderful time preparing this dish, first i poured a glass of red wine, then i went about preparing and adding all sorts of interesting ingredients. in the dish i prepared, i added provolone cheese, procuitto, and caviar,,, i cant tell you how delicous it turned out (suppose the red wine would make anything taste better) i would make it again, cook for at least 15 min longer,, and change the sauce to a simple red wine and caper.....

I thought the basis of this recipe was wonderful. I rolled the chicken in Italian flavored breadcrumbs, used garlic and herb chevre and added a bit of madeira to the sauce--it was great!

As a fairly new cook, this was a great, simple recipe. I've experiemented around with the 'stuffing' ingredients (roasted red peppers, mozerella, etc.). Also had better luck with a little more seasoning that advised and italian breadcrumbs. I consider the sauce optional - too much butter. Overall, a good recipe with a lot of potential to produce a great dish.

I am sorry to go against the grain, but neither I nor my family thought this dish was anything special. I feel that chicken breasts need a fair bit of added flavouring in order to work well, and the goat cheese filling just didn't provide what was needed. The sauce was also uninspiring.

Best dang thing I ever made! I wouldn't agree that it was all that easy - well, maybe I should have read the whole recipe first - the extra time it took to make the sauce gave the chicken the additional 10 minutes it needed (30 total). I wouldn't mess with the sauce - it's perfect - hope you like butter though. Dusted chicken with flour first, then egg, then bread crumbs. Prepare to be amazed.

This is an excellent dish! I was running late getting home tonight to cook dinner, so out of necessity I changed a couple of things. First, I didn't have time to stuff and roll, so I just spread the Chevre goat cheese on each breast and topped with onions. I baked at 400 for 30 minutes and made the gravy. It was a little thin, so I added a little flour to it to thicken it up. I placed each breast on the dinner plate and topped with the mushroom gravy... adding a side dish of fresh tomatos, olive oil, garlic and lots and lots of fresh basil, which I had quickly cooked into a light sauce atop angel hair. Yummy! The chicken was tender and very tasty. And, best of all, dinner was ready in less than 45 minutes! Definitely a keeper.

Outstanding! Or as my husband said over and over again with his mouth full.."this is awesome". Very simple to make. I baked the chicken for 25 minutes at 400 degrees and it was perfectly cooked. I did not need toothpicks or string. I also used portabella mushrooms as suggested below and the sauce was wonderful. I highly recommend this recipe!

This dish was well received by my family. The aromas coming from the kitchen stirred their appetites and certainly filled us all with anticipation. It was extremely easy to make and the preparation and cooking time was quick. The outcome was very tasty! I do have some suggestions: we found the goat cheese a bit grainy(and it's a tad expensive)--for the texture and mild taste, cream cheese would be a good substitute( less expensive and I find it retains a creamy texture); I used a mixture of mushrooms for enhanced flavour--shitake, portobello and cremini, were wonderful--the mushroom sauce adds quite a bit to the dish :)) This dish is a keeper in my recipe box. Thank you, Epicurious for a wonderful website :). Happy Cooking All!

As a culinary school graduate, I always look for simple meals to prepare. This recipe is great for parties and get-togethers. You don't need the sauce when serving as hors d'oeurves.

This was so easy and very delicious. I served it to about 10 people, everyone loved it. I loved it because I could make it ahead, and it tasted like I slaved over a hot stove all day.

I must admit I did change this recipe somewhat...instead of a bread crumb coating I used phyllo pastry...and made a Sundried Tomato Cream Sauce instead of the Mushroom Wine Sauce.

This chicken was yummy. I didn't go exactly by the recipe so I really must try it again. I didn't have goat cheese, so I used feta, and I had to use dry basil so I added some fresh parsley, which I had on hand. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used Corn Flake crumbs.

I must admit I expected less of this recipe on first glance; after all, it looked so easy to prepare, so perfect for a dinner party or a date. Easy it was, but it was also delicious. The goat cheese melts inside the chicken, making a creamy sauce which did not overpower the other flavors in the dish as I feared it would. Rather, the cheese was surprisingly mild, and somehow fit perfectly with the flavorful wine sauce and plump sauteed mushrooms. Although this dish isn't perfect (leftovers, I noticed, weren't very good), it is a delightful recipe and perfect for entertaining a few friends.
