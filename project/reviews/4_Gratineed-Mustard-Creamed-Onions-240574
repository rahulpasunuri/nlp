This is a delicious side dish, and one could use the same sauce and cheese to gratinate potatoes. Instead of milk, we used heavy cream and added another half tablespoon of dijon, and the dish was extra creamy and delicious.

Delicious! Definitely not your grand-mother's creamed onions, these are creamy-rich and flavorful with the mustard and parmesan coming through. I used frozen onions, thawing them first, and they worked just fine. I thickened the sauce a bit to avoid adding more cheese (and more unnecessary fat). Everyone loved them, everyone helped themselves to seconds and there were no leftovers! A Thanksgiving and Easter staple, they go beautifully with turkey, ham or a roast filet of beef.

Frozen pearl onions work just fine.

This recipe is fantastic. Last time, I didn't have grainy mustard on-hand, so doubled dijon which didn't completely replace grainy mustard flavor so added drained capers which gave it some pop.

I made this for easter and it was very well recieved. I used dry sherry instead and it worked well. I baked, not broiled it(until bubbly). I was in a pinch for stove-top space so i used frozen/thawed pearl onions. all around yum and would make again!

I made this last night with some left over roasted pearl onions. It was so much better than other creamed onions I've had. The mustard and nutmeg was a perfect touch. I think roasting the onions added more flavor to the onions, although I did not as a result have onion-flavored water to add. Highly recommended.

I have now made this recipe twice and not only were there no leftovers but guests were asking me for the recipe. A little time consuming to peel all those pearl onions but oh so worth the effort! Be sure to use the best whole grain mustard you can afford it is a good investment. Your friends & family will thank you for making this dish!

Delicious! This dish was part of our Thanksgiving Dinner menu and will be our goto Creamed Pearl Onion recipe.

Excellent. Made more sauce to cover the onions than the recipe called for as i found when I first made it, it wasn't enough to adequately cover them. Also used a little more cheese on top. Otherwise it was great and everyone liked it.

I am a creamed onion fan and only make it once a year. This is by FAR the best recipe I've encountered. I added a little more mustard as I love that, too. I wish I had made the whole recipe as cutting in half didn't leave me with enough leftovers!

I served this for my "first" Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I am now bringing it to Christmas dinner. I made it the day ahead- it would have been to much peeling all the onions the day of.

The onions were good, not great. I was excited to make them given other reviews and they turned out OK.

Exceptional recipe, a nice change from traditional creamed onions, the flavors were great. Lots of effort to boil and peel baby onions but oh so worth it for the flavorful result. Will be making this a Thanksgiving tradition!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was very well received. The mustard and Sherry make the difference. The second time I made it I used dry sherry and we liked it even more.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it. The flavors of the mustard, cream sherry and nutmeg compliment each other oh so well. This is a keeper!

Maybe it is because I used frozen pearl onions instead of getting them at the produce section but the onions tasted undercooked. I did not like this dish. The sauce was good but the onions were not.

These were excellent. We are experimenting with fall recipe ideas for a dinner party. My husband thinks he would prefer these as an appetizer with cocktails, versus a side dish, and I agree. I doubled the cheese and used high- quality parmigiano- reggiano cheese.
