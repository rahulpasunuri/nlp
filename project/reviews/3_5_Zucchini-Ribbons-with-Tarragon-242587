Love this quick, healthy recipe. I first saute some shallots and garlic (because I love the flavor), then add the zucchini. My sons love it, and so does my vegetable adverse husband

I made this recipe as a side dish to my Christmas dinner for 32 people. Since zucchini by itself is not my favorite I made this dish as a combination of equal parts zucchini and yellow squash. It was quite a hit. Everyone raved about it. I believe that the stronger zucchini flavor and the milder squash flavor complemented each other quite well. I have since made this recipe for a smaller group and they have also liked it.

I don't like tarragon and my husband planted some this year in the herb garden and challenged me to find something to do with it...besides giving it away. I saw this recipe and tried it exactly as is except used a veggie peeler than the slicer (faster for me) and we loved it. I plan on making it part of the entire summer zucchini permanent recipe rotation.

Yummy and super easy. We don't have a slicer, so we used a vegetable peeler, and it was great.
