This cake is truly amazing. The perfect balance of sweet, spice and salt. I made it for my caramel & pecan-loving mother for her 75th birthday. I consider myself a rather experienced baker and followed the recipe nearly to the letter, but like the other reviews, I would probably skip the expense of maple sugar ($11 for 8 oz bag!) next time. The reviews about dryness worried me so I split the batter into 3 8-inch round pans, watched the oven like a hawk and eventually removed the cakes at about 20 minutes. This enabled me to incorporate more frosting. I supplemented the amount of frosting by increasing the whipping cream (whole pint) without additional creme fraiche. I also doubled the caramel sauce and used it all. My mother (a MUCH more experienced baker) said it was the best cake she's ever tasted! Worth the trouble? Yes.

This was a very disappointing recipe. The frosting although was very good. I love ginger flavor but I thought it was too overpowering. The cake was darker than the picture but it was moist. Will not make a gain due to the fact that it was not worth all the trouble it took to find the ingredients. It should have been mentioned that organic and natural food stores are the only way to find maple sugar and light molasses and 100%.

Loved this cake, the frosting was amazing! I had trouble with the caramel. I made it ahead and tried to rewarm it. Apparently I heated it too quick and it separated. It still tasted wonderful, but it wouldn't drizzle, instead it made firm puddles. Made the cake a bit hard to cut! But my mom said they would make wonderful pralines, so I may have to figure out how to duplicate it!

I made this cake today and it turned out great. The cake was moist and flavorful. The icing was tangy and sweet and the caramel sauce was just "icing on the cake." I followed the recipe as precisely as I could. The only substitution I made was using dark molases instead of light - I couldn't find the light molases. My cake was much darker than the picture - it looked like chocolate cake. I had a little trouble getting it out of the cake pans - it was a bit crumbly. Other than that everything was delightful. I would definitely make it again - for a special occasion.

I am making this cake this weekend and am glad to see other substitutes for the maple sugar - I have some golden castor sugar that my mother in law brings over from England for me when she visits, so I may use that.

This cake was delicisous though slightly dry but the caramel sauce compensated for that. I was hoping for a cake that really tasted strongly of maple (especially with all the expensive maple sugar) but though the flavours were delicious, I didn't feel the maple taste was strong enough.

This cake was a disappointment. I am an experienced cake baker, so I am confident in my abilities. I found this cake to be very dry. The consistency of the frosting was too fragile and was not really stable enough to support the weight of the layers. I was excited by the ingredients in this cake and looked forward to making it. The flavors were good...the maple, five spices, ginger, but the end product disappointed. It was an expensive list of ingredients, and I think some could be subsitutued, as suggested by other reviewers, such as brown sugar for the maple sugar. I would suggest using cream cheese, and or mascarapone in place of the creme fraiche in the future. These are similar in taste, but much more stable when usedwith the whipped cream. Overall, a disappointment.

This was perfect for Thanksgiving. The caramel sauce was delicious and really easy to make. Replaced the five-spice with cinnamon and cloves and regular ginger instead of crystallized. Time intensive but worth it for a special occasion.

I tried this recipe because I've never seen a cake recipe that called for Chinese five-spice (very unique). Wow this cake took a lot of time. I couldn't fine creme fraiche, I had to surf to get that recipe. That took forever to get thick enough cause I couldn't find anything else but Ultra Pasturize heavy cream. I also had to surf for the salted maple caramel sauce, althought the cake is fine without it. The candied pecans are addictive! Good thing I doubled the recipe. Aside from all of the expensive ingredients, I want to make this again.

This is a very good cake. The only problem that I had with this recipe was the maple sugar. I could not find it anywhere in the city and so eventually had to order some online.

I loved this cake. I wanted to make a Maple Cake for Thanksgiving, and this was delicious. I didn't have maple sugar for the cake part, so I just used organic cane sugar and then a little extra maple. I also forgot about the caramel sauce, but we didn't need it; between the cake, the frosting, and the candied pecans, it didn't need anything else sweet. I would make the frosting with sour cream next time, but I loved it and so did my entire family.

I'm making this cake tonight. Have to say, I'm both excited and nervous. Excited because the reviews here are encouragingly positive, but nervous because I've spent more than $70 on the ingredients (which really is pretty excessive if you think about it) and if it comes out badly, I'm going to be brokenhearted. Wish me luck.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I'm bothered, once again, by the negativity of people's comments. yasky6 from Vancouver - you just had to use the Epicurious search engine to find the recipe for the Salted Maple-Caramel Sauce. The recipe isn't useless!! Be happy, cooking is supposed to be enjoyable.

Nice job of supplying the recipe for the Salted Maple-Caramel Sauce A rather useless recipe

I made this and it really was delicious. I, like many others, didn't use maple sugar but used regular sugar and brown sugar (half of each) in the cake. The result was great! I didn't miss the maple at all with all of the other maple flavors coming through. I think it was worth all the extra money I spent on the ingredients, but next time I'll make my own creme fraiche instead of buying it.

This cake was good. Made it for a family get together. The maple sugar was very expensive $18 for a 8 oz container. What I found was organic, large granulars. I've never used maple sugar before so didn't know what to expect. When I found myself short, I made a trip to my local natural food store where I found maple sugar in bulk, granulated, at half the price. I had already made the cake, not the frosting. The cake was dense, not light as it appears in the picture. I may give this a try again now that I've found a less expensive option. It is an expensive cake as others have commented. The maple caramel sauce is outstanding.

This cake was amazingly delicious. I took a bunch of liberties with the recipe and it still turned out great. I didn't have crystallized ginger so I used ground ginger, I didn't have molasses so I used golden syrup, I didn't have maple sugar so I mixed maple syrup with brown sugar. I swirled extra maple syrup into the batter before baking too. I didn't use the toasted pecans but I did serve extra sauce on the side and everyone poured on extra sauce. It was so good.

Ditto on the expensiveness of the ingredients, but my husband said this was so far "the dessert of the year". I did manage to find a 28 oz. container of maple sugar on amazon for $16 which will bring down the price next time. Instead of creme fraiche I may just do sour cream mixed with some whipping cream. The caramel sauce was divine and so easy to make. Be careful not to overcook the cake - it was a bit dry and I still baked it less than the recipe called for.

This cake looks very good! I will try it this weekend, what a shame maple products are so expensive down south. Here a can of organic grade b is sold 4$!

Made this yesterday...Not one piece left today! Couldn't find maple sugar, used half brown half white with a bit of maple syrup instead. Bit of an expensive cake to make...but SO worth it. Will be making it again!

IT was worth the cost.. I did not have to use all 4 jars of maple sugar.. so it was only $20. still expensvie but worth it. I doubled the candied pecans, and chopped them up and put them all on the outside of the cake.. there some left over that people snacked on or sprinkled over their cake slices. it's a gorgeous seasonal cake that I will make again! The frosting had a tiny hint of sour and it balanced the cake wonderfully!

can someone PLEASE post the Salted Maple-Caramel Sauce recipe? it is not on the site and this sounds delicious!

Thought it was great. I used equal parts of granulated sugar and light brown sugar for the 'maple sugar'. I would suggest making way more of the candied nuts and carmel sauce. I put a layer of nuts between the cake with lots of that carmel sauce in between as well. I also put syrup in the frosting as well. Was very delicious and holiday appropriate.

Loved the creme fresh in the frosting. Didn't use the maple sugar in the frosting; instead I used regular sugar and added some maple flavoring and vanilla. Maple sugar is really expensive and doesn't really have a strong maple flavor. I got the flavor I wanted with the extract. I didn't dare substitute in the cake because I don't think it translates directly. I also didn't love the licorice flavor from the Chinese Five Spice Powder. Next time I will just use cinnamon and a little cloves. That said, everyone loved the cake. The caramel was divine.

Outstanding recipe. Maple sugar ran us $14 for all 2cups - total luxury item but worth the price for the final product. I was worried because I wasn't familiar with the maple sugar and what I could find in town was larger sized crystals - it worked out well. The cake was easier to make than I expected. I'm typically scared of layer cakes but after reading through the recipe I felt I could tackle it and I'm happy I did. The result was amazing and it looked like it took more work than it actually did. Friends were impressed and fought for the leftover slices.
