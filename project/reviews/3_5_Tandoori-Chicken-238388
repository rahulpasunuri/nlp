This turned out amazing, I was unable to find vindaloo paste so I substituted with siracha and it was a great substitute. I will be making this again. Coupled with the cucumber, tomato, and feta salad. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cucumber-Tomato-and-Feta-Salad-365671

terrific! In demand here-make sure to have the chicken look "charred" as the recipe suggests. The flavor multiplies.

Very nice recipe, and it could not be easier to prepare. I cut back the vindaloo paste thinking it would be too hot--next time I'll use the full amount, and will probably increase the amount of fresh mint and cilantro, which I love. The masala- spiced potatoes recipe goes quite well with this.

I marinated the chicken in the mixture overnight to really meld the flavors... it was delicious, especially served with the Cucumber Raita...

I love this recipe. Quick, easy, interesting, and not too spicy for children. I have made it 3 times in as many weeks.

This is the Chicken Vindaloo recipe that Ruth Reichl made on a Diary of a Foodie episode... fantastic! Couldn't find Patek's brand vindaloo paste but it came out delicious - even my 1 and 3 yr olds ate it! Made the Cucmber-Mint Raita recipe from this site and it was great, too.

This was pretty delicious and really easy to make. I was surprised by how moist the chicken turned out to be.

I did not have Vindaloo paste, but used Vindaloo spice seasoning from Penzeys.com. Didn't have fresh mint so used extra cilantro. We grilled these on the gas grill at medium heat (about 30+ minutes) instead of using the oven - my husband raved over how moist and delicious they were!

Thank you to the cooks from India! I made the "kachumber", and it was delicious. To the reviewer whining about this being an advert for vindaloo paste, this recipe was included in a section called "Speedy May Meals". I've made authentic Indian food from scratch, and it would never be described as quick. This is a compromise, but still worth making.

The yogurt side dish the reviewers mention is 'raita', made with greek style yogurt, to which is added salt, pepper, a sprinking of pakrika and -- as the main ingredient -- anything from roughly grated cucumber, chopped garlic, to even shredded pineapple.

Nice version of my country's most famous dish. Besides raita, it would be nice with some baby red onions pickled in vinegar. And maybe a 'kachumber' -- finely diced cucumber, red onions and deseeded tomato with a dressing of lime juice, salt and sugar

I love food snobs. Those who voted it down didn't try it. It's a mixed metaphor -- so what! Fake Indian food is sooo American. Easy to make and delicious. Also, I served with Jasmine rice, Naan, and Tziki sauce (Oh my!), all from TJs.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy and very tastey. I agree that I would make a little more of the yogurt mixture to have on the side. I also used low-fat plain yogurt (not Greek) and it was still very good.

Loved it! So Simple. b A little spicy. Should have followed the advise of the other person by adding a cool yogurt sauce at the end. Still...very very good!

I agree that vindaloo and tandoori are two completely different dishes. Maybe to save time and cooking method did they use vindaloo paste, but aren't you supposed to use a tndoori pot to cook tandoori dishes? And vindaloo is (supposed to be) extremely spicy!

Well Done, "A cook from California", your review was hilarious, and accurate

I couldn't find vindaloo paste from Patak's, despite visiting 2 pretty good ethnic food aisles, so I used some curry paste I already had. I liked the addition of the fresh mint, the fact you didn't have to marinade for hours, and the introduction to Greek style yogurt. .(expensive, though--I suspect draining yogurt over cheesecloth or the like would be a workable, cheaper alternative). I only made 3 legs, but a full sauce recipe, then microwaved the remainder to serve as extra for the rice and steamed spinach I served it with. very yummy

I dont think you use anything vindaloo in tandoori dishes.

This isn't a recipe; it's an advert for "vindaloo paste." You could do as well by the instructions on the jar.

Thought the flavor was great. Served with Trader Joe's Jasmine rice (3 min in microwave) and Naan. The only thing I may have done differently is to add a small bit of cool yogurt sauce at the end to balance the spice of the chicken. Easy though and GREAT!! I'm not even a big fan of chicken. Much less the dark meat.
