Have just taken this out of the oven and sampled it - delicious! I left out the cinnamon and allspice since I didn't have any and it still tastes wonderful. I almost feel guilty for making the entirety for just myself. Almost. ;-)

I served this dish to guests and they went back for 2nd and 3rd helpings! My husband hates eggplant and had 2 helpings. I can't use salt so instead I added 1/2 cup of red wine, 1/2 orange peel finely grated, juice of 1 orange, 1 T sugar, 2 T balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, and garlic powder. I increased the garlic to 3 T. For the topping, I added 1 egg and put the topping mixture in the mixer for lack of a ricer. The house was filled with a wonderful aroma while cooking. I made a Turkish salad to accompany the main dish and served pistacio gelato for dessert. I highly recommend this recipe.

I messed with this a bunch. I'm not crazy about ground lamb, so I used lean ground beef -- next time I think I'll try it with braised lamb shoulder, which should work fine with the other ingredients. I also roasted the eggplant, and in fact roasted it in the same casserole I assembled the finished product in -- just poured the meat mixture over, saved some dishwashing. (I wouldn't have attempted this if the eggplant had scorched, but it did not.) I also doubled the garlic and added red wine (because if I can, I will) and some red peppers for more veggie impact. Result was great! An excellent alternative to moussaka, which, though delicious, can be gloppy, time-consuming and labor-intensive. This one is going in the rotation for sure.

This was a lot of work for mediocre flavor. I doubt I would go to the trouble to make this dish again. I roasted the eggplant as another reviewer suggested. Used all the spices plus extra garlic and fresh Cuban oregano. None-the-less, it was rather bland. In hindsight (actually, hind taste) the addition of some sliced black olives might have turned it up a notch.

Very good - total comfort food, but a bit more refined. I halved this recipe for a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish, and it worked well. Still made a lot of food.

Simply wonderful, especially with the following changes: Increase garlic to 2 Tbsp, and omit allspice and cinnamon. Toss eggplant with 4 Tbsp olive oil and bake at 450 for about 20 minutes instead of frying. OK to use 28-oz can of tomatoes and all of its juice. Not necessary to refrigerate overnight. Increase butter in topping to 4 Tbsp. Recipe may be halved.

The lamb mixture was delicious. I lightened this up by using frozen hash browns, thawed, mixed with much less crumbled feta. It browned nicely. I didn't use any Parm at all. It wasn't as rich as this is probably meant to be but worked well for a weeknight supper.

Very delicious. I used 2 tablespoons garlic. Good reheated the next day for lunch.

We have always loved this dish, but last night I recreated it with leftover lamb and the remains of twice-baked potatoes...superb!!

What a delicious meal. I made it after getting home relatively late for my husband who loves lamb. The flavors worked nicely together and the richness of the potatoes on top added a beautiful dimension. I scaled the recipe in half but added extra spices. I will be making this again.

Wow - nice combo of Shepherd's Pie and Moussaka. The feta and cinnamon add a rich dimension. The only change I made was to swap half the potatoes for sweet potatoes. The blended mash had a nice depth for the lamb and you can't beat the extra beta carotene.

The ultimate Sheperd's Pie!!! I used chunks of lamb, small and deglazed the pan with red wine..great!!!

A definite 3.5 fork recipe. Agree that it should be renamed Greek Shepard's Pie. Everyone loved it and the presentation of the bubbling meat mixture with the browned potato crust was fantastic. A good Greek green salad as a starter or along side make a great meal even in the middle of summer. Took the suggestion of adding some cream and milk to make to topping less dry and was very happy I did. Also used 1/2 lamb and 1/2 lean ground beef as I only had a lb. of lamb in the freezer. Will likely do this again because even though I like the flavor of lamb it can take over a dish if too high. Also used fresh mint from the garden for a brighter flavor. The leftovers were also enjoyed with relish!!

My husband & I loved this for Sunday dinner. It was easy to cut in half, not at all labor intensive, and nice that you can make components the day before. I added more garlic and cinammon just to give it even more exotic flavor, but otherwise left recipe alone. Will keep this on file.

I cut the lamb in half, was generous with all of the spices and omitted the feta from the topping because I didn't have any on hand. It was very, very good. My kids thought it was great. I'll bet it would be even better if you throw in a handful of pinenuts.

After reading the recipe and reviews I decided this was perfect for my left over lamb and lone eggplant in the frig. My husband has "acid reflux" so I decided to use the yellow/orange low acid fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes. I also cheated and used Betty Crocker Instant Potatoes in the pouch. Perfect for two people. The recipe was easy to pare down for two people. The egg plant really really extended the meat as it melded into one. Do try the Dutch Grafitti Eggplant for wonderful flavor and texture. I also pared down the olive oil when frying the eggplant. Used additional water instead of oil. It was fine and kept its shape and was tender.Enjoy!

The lamb filling was really wonderful, but the potato topping was quite dry and seemed too thick. Next time (and there will be lots more next times!) I'll make mashed potatoes with some cream to thin them, and sprinkle the top with Parmesan. I am not a bechamel fan, so this concept was perfect and so simple. Now to find more ground lamb!

A wonderful dish to make for some kind of potluck or buffet. Made in a large white gratin dish, it had a beautiful presentation. Everyone raved!

I tried this recipe after using advanced search for lamb and eggplant. I was unsure how it would turn out, especially the feta in the potato. WOW! Was I ever impressed! I usually make a pretty good moussaka, but my hubby always complains it is so rich and heavy. I made this for him, and he had 2 servings. The potato topping is quite delicious, and you never miss the bechamel that is normally used. Try it!

I used leftover leg of lamb, cut into small cubes, and it was excellent. My husband usually passes on eggplant, and even he wanted seconds!

I've made this recipe several times over the past year for our family and toddler who now LOVES lamb and eggplant. Before she had teeth, I would place a portion of the lamb/eggplant mixture in the food processor and make a separate loaf for her. Never thought this recipe could be used for gourmet babyfood but what I way to expose children to a higher cuisine!

This is a delicious and homey recipe that my family (two of whom claim to hate eggplant) just devoured. It's excellent left over, too. It's really a Greek Shepherd's Pie - you'll be disappointed if you're expecting a true pot pie. We'll be eating this again during the cold, rainy winter. Yum.

This recipe is fantastic!!! The smells, the flavors it was just great. The only mistake I made was in trying to double it for the freezer. One recipe is more than enough. We will definitely have it again. It also makes a nice presentation for company.

I used leftover lamb that I cut into cubes, and it was delicious! This even freezes well. We don't have a ricer, so I just mashed the potatoes -- it still came out wonderful. Yum!!

awful! Chewy eggplant and tangy crusy -- i couldn't even eat it. My husband thought it would be OK after a day of skiing, at it was warm and hearty. I would never make it again!

This dish was much, much better than I expected. The combination of spices was superb, and I'll be making this over and over, I'm sure.

Very convenient to make it a couple of days in advance and have it taste just as good. I added a handful of dried currants with the tomatoes. Very good indeed.

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover roast lamb. I substituted cubed cooked lamb for the ground lamb in this recipe and it was a tasty family dinner that pleased everyone.

We tried this as the main course for a wine club Greek Dinner for 12 people. I doubled the recipe and it got rave reviews. We served it with a large Greek salad, and buttered asparagus. It is in every respect a "keeper", and I have shared the recipe with others at the dinner.
