Made this without brown sugar. It didn't need it. Perfect with Easter ham.

I cooked this recipe for my 2-year old. I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and about a tablespoon and a half of butter. The puree was still delicious.

Exceptional! Excellent way to change up sweet potatoes- the Parsips make it so good sweet yet savory! My mom couldn't stop eating it!

I cooked the parsnips and yams ahead of time and had them in the fridge. So when it came time to put everything in the cuisinart, I combined everything cold(I heated the butter in the microwave). I tasted it cold, and it tastes great cold! yum! So I served it cold!

I made this on Christmas. Those who liked it, loved it, including my 9 year old nephew. The more finicky wouldn't even try it. We had lots of leftovers from the big meal so I re-heated it with left over steamed cauliflower. The flavors blended well and I liked the crunch added in. I will try making it with all three veggies next time.

This is a must at our family Thanksgiving gathering each year. So quick and easy and memorable. I use this recipe in a class I teach on quick and easy holiday side dishes. Fantastic!

Can't rave enough. This is a must at our Thanksgiving

This is a hit! Looking to get deeper flavor from the vegetables, I coated them with a little grapeseed oil (or any flavorless oil) and roasted the peeled veggies until soft. Then followed the directions. People could not get enough of this yummy dish, seemingly to prefer it over the steak! Funny.

I thought this dish was superb. I gave the vegetables a little extra cooking time because I wanted to be sure they'd puree well. I used about half the butter called for. I'll definitely make again.

A big hit this Thanksgiving; I'm sorry I didn't double or triple the recipe! So easy. It's a great comfort food.

I am an 11 year old girl and I made this for my mom and grandma's birthday. We thought it was AWESOME! It was so creamy, but so light and delicious at the same time. Instead of sweet potatos though, I used yams because that is what the birthday girls felt like. Everyone enjoyed it and many went back for seconds (some even for thirds). We all loved it and it will definately be a keeper. Epicurious has the BEST recipes!

Delicious! Very light with a subtle taste of the parsnips. My husband usually won't eat parsnips, so I didn't tell him what was in the dish. He went back for seconds! Easy to make and quite a nice twist on sweet potatoes.

This is very tasty but a bit starchy. Mine certainly did not have the pretty orange color in your photo! In fact it was a kind of greenish-gray color as the sweet potatoes oxidize when they hit the air. Next time, I will use yams for color and I am sure the taste will be just as good.

A heavenly dish...so yummy!!!

The distinctive taste of parsnips and the mild sugary flavor of sweet potatoes are an excellent combination that provides for an out of ordinary side dish. Easy recipe, though I found that I had to puree the cooked parsnips and sweet potatoes in small batches to obtain the right smooth consistency. I served the dish with maple glazed turkey. A keeper.

The first time I made this it was excellent. The second time it didn't come out so well and I don't know what I did wrong. So Im going to have to try it once more. It was great with the flank steak with chimichurri and had great consistency.

Very nice, straightforward puree. The flavor is unmistakably parsnip-y while the sweet potatoes give it a nice light orange color. We cut the sugar in half and didn't miss it.

My husband, who is not a fan of sweet potatoes, loved this recipe. He especially likes to eat it with the flank steak with chimichurri sauce. The sweet and tart flavors go well together.

This was a very easy and tasty side dish.

Excellent side dish. I omitted the brown sugar and it was still incredibly sweet - probably because of the parsnips. This tastes best when it's fresh and served piping hot.
