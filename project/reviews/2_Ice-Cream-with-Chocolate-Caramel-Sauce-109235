simple but good recipe. I prefer making my own ice cream with recipes from http://www.make-ice-cream.com/

I have not made this recipe, but I make caramel sauces all the time. As the cook from NY says, YOU NEED TO REHEAT THE SAUCE AFTER ADDING THE CREAM. The sugar is well over 150C/300F temp when it caramelizes; whether you add cold or warm cream, it is going to cool down the sugar so rapidly it hardens (and splatters - best to put the pan in the sink before adding the cream to prevent burns). Place the saucepan back over medium heat, stir occasionally and keep a close eye until the hardened caramel dissolves into a sauce.

This sauce is delicious but not easy to make. When I added the cream the caramel became rock hard. I wrote Gourmet asking them if the instructions were incorrect but I never heard from them. I was recently watching a show on the food channel that suggested warming the cream in a separate sauce pan before adding to caramel. This works like a charm.

This was delicious and chocolatey, but it did not have too strong of a caramel flavor. My caramel began to harden, but when you finished cooking it with the chocolate it turned out perfect. Those people who had hard caramel may have been using fresh from the fridge cream or did not take the time to re-melt the caramel.

I made the caramel 2 times because I thought that I was doing something wrong. It's a waste. The caramel turns to rock candy in the pan once you add the cream. The instructions aren't right.

I agree with the other reviewer, my perfectly colored caramel hardened the minute I put the cream in, so I reheated it with the chocolate, it was okay.

This recipe just doesn't work. Pour in the cream and the sugar instantly siezes up and turns into a hard ball. There's a step or instruction missing - do it as written and you'll waste your cream, sugar and time.
