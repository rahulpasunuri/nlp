I made this last night hoping for a ton of leftovers but the dish was such a success that there is barely any left! Even my brother-in-law who despise veggies as well as beans ate second helpings! Yeay! I didn't have a green pepper so I used half a red and half a yellow one and it was delicious!

This was a crowd pleaser. I did not put the chili powder in and instead put a bunch of fresh cilantro.

This was delish. I used a 19oz can of crushed tomatoes with the fresh plus about a cup of chicken broth that I had in the freezer. I also added about a Tbsp of coriander, an extra tsp cumin and a few pinches sweet paprika.

Excellent chili! I added pearl barley as well.

I've made this many times. I use boxed chopped tomatoes and extra tomato juice to keep it saucy. I love the way I can vary the vegetables depending on what I have, but I always add extra onion and tomato. It's also great served over cornbread - makes it richer and "meatier."

It's a cold, fall evening in the midwest. I'm in search of...soup! I stumbled across this recipe and, I'm pleased to say, it hit the spot. I did A LOT of substituting (sweet potato for squash, some kidney beans for the a portion of the chickpeas, etc.) but it still came out tasty! Great combination of flavors and super healthy. The chili was a bit thick and the next time I make it I think I'll try some chicken broth instead. Happy cooking!

This is my favorite chile recipe by far. This serves as a good base recipe from which substitutions can be made. We put in lots of summer squash and fresh corn. We only used two 19-oz cans of beans - one chickpea, one kidney - and substituted one can of tomatoes for the fresh. Grate some fresh parmesan over the bowls. Very yummy!

After all the rave reviews, I was highly disappointed with this chili. I didn't change the recipe- used fresh tomatoes, etc., and it just lacked flavor- even after dumping in more cayenne pepper with each taste as well as some tobasco. Nothing extraordinary about this at all. Would not recommend.

The chick peas and zucchini make this my favorite chili. The first time I made it I realized too late that I didn't have any chili powder (!) and it made an excellent summer time soup without- even better than the chili in my opinion.

this was absolutely dilicious. i halved the recipe, and because i didn't have enough garbanzo, i put in half kidney beans instead of garbanzo. also, i put in way too much dried oregeno by accident and some extra cumin and more tomatoes purposely. the end result was delicious, everyone loved it. i served it with sweet-potato corn bread and some peas. it was not completely chili-like, but i would recommend it to anyone.

I've made this recipe several times and it's been great each time. Once I accidentally left it on the stove for a while and it was still great! I love the way the lightness of the vegetables and chickpeas works with the chili. A great, easy dish for vegetarians AND kids.

This wasn't my idea of a chili - just a lightly spiced vegetable stew. The vegetables lost their texture due to all being cooked for an hour, & the flavour of the fresh herbs was largely lost due to being added at the beginning. It could be improved greatly by cooking for less time & adding the herbs towards the end, but would still not be as rich a chili as those versions (whether meat or vegetarian) that use chocolate, beer, ancho chillies etc - the style that I prefer.

We were not as impressed as all the previous reviewers. I followed the recipe to the letter and made no modifications. The taste/texture/appearance were not bad, just certainly not a 3 or 4 fork meal. I can't see putting this one on a "got-to-have-it" list for another day. Note after I wrote the first note - I decided to brown about 1/4 pound ground beef with some onions and add that to the vegetarian stew. Made it much better - I guess I just like the meat!

This was yummy! I used 1 red and 1 green bell pepper, a mix of zucchini and yellow squash, 3 15-oz cans of chickpeas, and some hot sauce. I was also generous with the herbs and spices. Very filling, a lot of flavor and texture, and it keeps really well.

Very, very tasty. I would consider more of a vegtable soup, not chili. I also found that I had to keep adding a lot of liquid while it cooked. The second time I made it, I added beef and used beef broth instead of adding water and liked it even more. It keeps well, and is very easy to make. This is going to become one of those dishes that I make on a regular basis.

My husband and mom admitted that this was better than they expected, and they ate full bowls. I reduced the amount of garbanzos to 3 small cans (~15 oz each) and this provided plenty of substance; I wouldn't want more beans than this. Next time I would also reduce the chili powder and cilantro.

Excellent! I only used 32 oz. beans total, and a used a little less oil, It had great depth of flavor, and was very hearty and filling.

For those who think of MEAT when you hear CHILI, this is not CHILI. That is what my father and husband said when I made this dish - after they both had TWO BOWLS of it! It was addictive! However, I think the recipe has a misprint for the chili powder, I only used 2 TEAspoons as opposed to 2 TABLEspoons it listed. I guess if you have an iron stomach, go for the tablespoons. Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this dish - just call it STEW for those picky eaters...

This was a wonderfully easy recipe. I used yellow and red peppers instead of green. I also used kidney beans as well as chick peas. My husband doesn't like tomatoes, so I put in crushed tomatoes instead. Excellent recipe Very versitile.

Very hearty and great chili. I added habanero sauce for some kick. Also, I used one can of mixed chili beans for variety.

Excellent. I actually made this in a crock pot at work (Yes, I keep spices in my desk!) & ate it for lunch several days. I never tired of it and it was even better the 2nd day.

This is a great recipe! My husband and I are trying a vegan diet and this recipe hits the spot! I served it over rice and was great! Definitely worth trying.

We made this dish and it was great! Wonderful taste. I used 2 jars of Del Monte tomatoes with garlic. Added a few dashes of hot sauce. Served it with a salad. Will make it again soon.

I made this using 3 zucchini and 3 16 oz cans of chickpeas and added a habanero pepper and a red bell pepper. I also added more chili powder and cilantro than the recipe called for. I served it with corn souffle, it was very good.

We made this dish for our superbowl party. It was a hit even for the meat-eaters in the crowd. We used canned tomatoes with jalepeno peppers which gave the chili an added little kick. Very yummy alternative to regular chili!
