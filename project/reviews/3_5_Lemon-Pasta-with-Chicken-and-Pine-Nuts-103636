Very tasty served warm. Added lemon zest and used less oil than called for. I used broccoli instead of snow peas because that's what I had on hand.

Yummy, quelle bonne petite recette pour la semaine. Les pois mange-tout ajoutent une bonne petite touche croustillante et une super belle couleur. J'ai utilisé ds pâtes au poivres. Je n'étais pas folle de la sauce jusqu'à ce que je l'ajoute avec les noix, superbe!

My husband and I loved this! Based on other reviews that the dressing needed a little more "oomph", I cooked the chicken using a lemon pepper seasoning, and then made the dressing in the pan in order to incorporate juices, etc. It turned out wonderfully, although I do think next time I will double the dressing. I used bowtie pasta and it worked out well.

Thanks to the reviews here (and some substitutions to accommodate what I had in the house), this turned out to be a very good easy weeknight dinner. I marinated the chicken for 15 minutes in olive oil, lemon juice and pepper. I used red, orange and yellow peppers instead of snow peas and chives instead of parsley. I also reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup, added lemon zest and upped the lemon juice and reduced the mustard slightly.

Good! I made the dressing according to the recipe and then decided to double the lemon and Dijon because it needed more zip. Next time I'd reduce the oil a bit, too. I added lemon zest and red bell pepper, and I used fusilli pasta. I think the pine nuts would be better as a garnish since they got a little mushy. Overall, this was an easy weeknight meal with plenty of yummy leftovers. Now I have to visit Gelson's deli so I can taste their version!

What a huge hit! My mother in law said it was one of the best meals she has eaten--and of course, so healthy. I followed other reviewer suggestions: 1. Marinated the chicken in lemon juice, zest and olive oil. 2. Added asparagus and red pepper as well as snow peas 3. Made the sauce with a lot less (olive) oil and added zest to it. 4. Substituted walnuts for pine nuts (much cheaper). 5. I doubled the recipe. Yum!

Made with broccoli and red bell peppers. Marinated chicken in lemon and olive oil. Good, light, quick Friday meal with enough for leftovers for a picnic lunch on Saturday.

Good dish! We used asparagus instead of snow peas, which really complemented the mustard/lemon sauce. I agree with the reviews below--use less oil in the sauce and marinate the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, and pepper.

This was a delicious and easy weeknight meal. We used linguine and substituted sauteed red peppers for the snow peas. Would definitely make it again!

Yummy and pretty! Increasing the mustard, lemon juice and adding some lemon zest ( I used regular fetticine) only used 1/3 cup olive oil. I had some leftover grilled chicken tossed with some dressing and added red/yellow peppers and torn spinach with warm pasta. Fresh basil for serving!!

Yum, yum, yum! I marinated the chicken breast in olive oil and lemon juice. I also used bow-tie pasta. I will make this again and again.

Oh baby! This knocked my husband's socks off! Used DeCecco spinach linguine (life is too short to save 50 cents a pop on mediocre pasta) cooked al dente (don't get me started on mushy pasta)As recommend by other reviewers, I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon and pepper. Doubled the grain dijon mustard, doubled the lemon juice, switched to olive oil and decreased the amount to 1/2 cup. (thank you previous reviewers) Sit back and enjoy the meal and the praise!

Oh baby! This knocked my husband's socks off. Used DeCecco spinach linguine (life is too short to save 50 cents a pop and use poor quality pasta!), as always, cooked al dente (don't even get me started on overcooked pasta), as recommended by other reviewers, marinated the chicken in olive oil, pepper and lemon. Doubled the the grain dijon mustard, doubled the lemon juice, switched to olive oil and decreased amount to 1/2 cup (thank you previous reviewers!) Sit back and enjoy the food and the praise!

We enjoyed this very much. I didn't have lemon pepper fettucine, so I cooked regular fettucine and sprinkled it with lemon pepper right after I put a little oil on it. Instead of snow peas (didn't have any), I sauteed some orange bell pepper and some sliced mushrooms just a little and mixed that in. Reduced the oil in the vinaigrette to just enough to get it to emulsify - about 2 tablespoons. Only drizzled about half of the vinaigrette on and decided that was enough. We ate it warm and it was great! Will definitely make again.

I think what made this dish so much fun was using whole grain Dijon mustard, marinating the chicken in olive oil, lemon with pepper and making homemade pasta. My only suggestion with that is if you are using any type of pasta machine, grind the pepper and any lemon rind, dry or not, in a pestle. It may (and did) get stuck in the fettuccine die. Oh, and I forgot the parsly and didn't even miss it.

Rating: 2
I found this recipe to be tolerable, not memorable. Maybe it was because I couldn't find lemon-pepper fettuccine, but it tasted bland. I liked it more on Day 2 so may try it again and add onions or garlic.

Rating: 3
You think it's good the first day? Just wait until you taste the leftovers! Yum. It was even better the second (and third) days. I added lemon zest and thinly sliced red peppers. I think next time I'll use more lemon juice and mustard in the sauce and cut back on the oil, but other than that, it was great.

This is one of my all time favorite summer recipies. I bring it to potlucks and picnics all the time. I use regular pasta and add a little more lemon.

I LOVE this recipe, but admit, mostly during the warmer weather...It got spring-like this weekend here in Philly so I dug this out and made it again. YUM! My variations: ONLY olive oil! I also use petite peas, and regular farfalle pasta, AND I marinate the chicken for a bit in olive oil and lemon first. The pine nuts are KEY!! Love this dish at room temp, as either main dish OR side dish. Major keeper!!

I thought this dish was pretty good...but not great. I added red pepper, green onion, a little shallot, & mushrooms. I used sweet peas instead of snow (that's what I had on hand)and regular linguine. What did make a difference though was using lemon olive oil and adding zest to the chicken (while cooking) and again to the cooked pasta. I was surprised to see that the veggies called for were not to be sauteed or blanched or anything. Since my husband isn't a fan of the raw veggies, I sauteed them in the lemon olive oil prior to cooking the chicken. It was a very light dish and I found that I probably needed more of the "sauce" than was called for. I think I would have enjoyed this more in the spring or summer--just not very satisfying for a cold winter night.

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and a bit of olive oil before I cooked it, and just used ordinary pasta. It was fabulous!

This dish is a staple in our house, perfect for make ahead entertaining. It helps that my toddler eats it too. I always add red peppers for colour, and I have trouble finding the lemon pepper pasta so I add some lemon zest for that extra zip.

This has turned out to be one of our very most popular company recipes. It is delicious, yet fairly simple for people who are overwhelmed by heavy spice and flavor.I used toasted chopped almonds rather than pine nuts, as I was not about to pay the prices they want for pine nuts where I live. Easily doubled the mustard and tripled the lemon. Even the kids all ate it without complaint. Snow peas are not as easy to find as they used to be, and I have made this with whole pods of other varieties of sweet small peas with good results also.

Very nice summer dish. I agree with the oily comments, maybe if the vinaigrette was made just before serving,I made mine several hours before. Still would make again though.

Yummy dish. The oil has to be reduced greatly and I added extra lemon and mustard for more flavor. Great Summer staple.

This was a nice pasta dish, but not out of this world like some of the other reviewers seem to think. I added some yellow peppers to the dish for colour and used some fresh basil wiuth the parsley, which was nice. I love pine nuts but there seemed to be an unusual amount in this recipe - or maybe they all just ended up on my plate? I used whole wheat pasta - as I always do, and it tasted fine, although I'm sure the extra lemony taste from lemon pepper pasta would be nice, too.

Rating: 4
I made this with two changes. I used pre-cooked lemon pepper chicken breast strips, thus eliminating the oil. I doubled the sauce of mustard and lemon juice to make up for the lack of oil. I had some wonderful tarragon mustard that I bought in Paris last spring. What a great flavor! My husband and son loved it.

I grew up eating this dish from Gelson's, and I was expecting great things. I was not disappointed. I doubled the recipe and fed my family of 4 while I went to a class, and when I returned home, there was nothing left! They couldn't get enough! I've made it twice since for company, and everyone raved! Don't just make this in the summer...it's a great dish you can make in advance. Definitely get the lemon pepper pasta, if you can find it. Delicious!!

very oily and bland. i've made many recipes from this site, and this has to be one of my least favorites.

Rating: 4
I searched for a recipe using pine nuts because I had some in the fridge that I didn't want to go to waste and found this. Boy, am I glad. I was so simple to make and much better than I had anticipated it would be. Very addicting! I upped the portion of chicken to a little over a pound, upped the snow peas to eight ounces, and, like other reviewers, used olive oil instead. I *did* use the erroneous 3/4 cup, but didn't find it to be excessively oily. Could have been because of the extra chicken and peas. Also, I couldn't find lemon pepper fettucine in my neighborhood, so I settled for lemon pepper angel hair. It worked fine. I will make this again and again.

I didn't make it exactly-I only used 2 tablespoonfuls of oil, and I used extra virgin olive oil. I filled in with low salt chicken broth. I did make my own lemon pepper pasta. My husband and I both absolutely loved it. I'd make this again in a heartbeat. We ate it room temp. Excellent-I can't imagine anyone finding it bland.

Rating: 3
The addition of dijon mustard to this lemon sauce really gave it a nice flavor and added some complexity to the taste. I didn't make this recipe exactly, since I substituted chicken broth and butter for the oil, but I definately would keep this recipe as a starting point for future dishes.

I added sun dried tomatos (the kind you soak in hot water)and they seemed to jazz it up a bit. Will definitely make it again and hopefully this time there'll be some leftovers to enjoy.

I am lucky enough to live near 2 Gelsons and this was always one of my favorites. I didn't notice recipe until perusing last year's bbq issue for ideas. This is super easy to make. the only change I made to make it a bit healthier was to cut the oil by 1/2 with fat free chicken broth and emulsify it in a quickprep mini cuisinart. I also lessened the amount of lemon juice by 1 tablespoon. Delicious. I too add a little parmesean cheese. Very good with chardonnay or saugvignon blanc on a hot summer evening in encino!

My family loved this recipe! I was quick and easy to prepare and even better the next day. If you serve it warm, pass the grated parmesean cheese! Very yummy. I felt the oil content in this dish was fine.

Rating: 3
Tasty though not superb, but defintely a great, eye-catching summer dish. I agree with the cooks that say that less oil is needed. Thanks to the great reviews I read, I added in some red bell pepper and kalamata olives and heavily seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper. I also cut the chicken in large chunks rather than small slices. I only put in about 3 tbsp. of olives, but their briny taste MADE the dish, I'll put in a good 1/3 to 1/2 cup next time. Will put in more mustard next time too, the flavor was a little lost--maybe 3 tbsp.? I too blanched and sauteed the snow peas and peppers. I used fresh pasta. Served it warm with a green salad and hot garlic bread; also tasty later chilled. A vividly COLORFUL and visually appealing dish (red pepper strips, green parsley and snow peas, black olives and pepper chunks). I already plan to make it again for an upcoming gathering.

I love the taste of lemon and pasta. I saw this recipe on Epicurious TV -- my family loves it. Angel's Hair Pasta with Lemon and Pine Nuts. Ina Garten makes it and serves it with a dollop of caviar! Yum.

We loved it! We took advantage of the other suggestions and added red pepper, and zuchini,and our chicken was leftover barbeque. We also cut the oil back substantially. We can't wait to taste the leftover tomorrow once the flavors have "blended."

This was great! I'm glad I read the reviews, though--I used 1/3 cup oil, and it was still MORE than enough. I'll probably go with 1/4 next time. I also modified things a bit: cooked my chicken season with some lemon pepper, lightly sauteed the snow peas along with some zucchini, tossed in a few sliced kalamata olives. Served cold with parmesan and fresh bread, and my dinner guest ate 2 large portions! I liked it, too. :-)

A straightforward, earthy dish for spring. We enjoyed this a lot with some changes. I used fresh fettucine and toasted the pine nuts thoroughly. I also substituted extra virgin olive oil and cut back to 1/4 cup, plus another tablespoon to cook the chicken. I blanched the snow peas for about 30 seconds before slicing for color. We ate it warm. The olive oil gives it a great flavor, we may add sliced olives in the future.

Why not simplify this dish with a roasted chicken from the grocery? My three year old loved this and thought it was great fun helping with the snowpeas. But also wanted a little more dressing for flavour.

I'd give this a four, except there's a typo in the recipe: 2 T. plus 2/3 cups canola oil in the list of ingredients; "Add remaining 3/4 cups canola...." I used 2/3 cups plus a "little extra." My guest really loved it at room temp., with regular fettucine. Can the editors post the correct amount of canola oil here...or e-mail me, please.

I made this for my mother, father and family. While my kids didn't like it, the adults raved about it. I used lemon pepper pasta and I also cut in some red pepper to give it more color. I served it at room temperature. I ate the leftovers the next day, and they were wonderful. I'll be making this again.
