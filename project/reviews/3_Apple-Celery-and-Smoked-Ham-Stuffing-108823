my grandson in law made it for us for Christmas dinner. It was a big hit with everyone. It was so moist and very tasty. My daughter made sure we had the recipe to come home with. I'll be making it for my guest that you can count on.

I've made this stuffing several times and always had great success. It stays moist and is easy to prepare in advance. Definitely pay for the higher quality ham - but add less then instructed. Pairs really well with Cider or Herb turkey recipes.

I have made this dressing for the last 3 years when I stopped stuffing a turkey. I reduce the amount of apples and ham. I love recipes I can make ahead. Add broth and eggs just before baking while turkey is resting and being carved. My family and friends love it. Only problem is there are no left overs.

I've made this recipe for 3 years in a row. My family loves it. The consistency is good, the flavors are outstanding, and overall is a very good stuffing.

Have made this for two Thanksgiving and always well-received. I always make it the night before, which saves time the next day. Generally only like stuffing inside the turket, but this one stays really moist.

Nice complement to the Herb-roasted Turkey with apple cider gravy.

Made this with the entire menu, but wasn't very impressed. Will definitely skip it next year. It was mushy and the ham just detracted. Would have been much better with sausage.

Not so good. The ham took away from the flavor of the turkey. Very disappointing.

We did the entire menu that went with this dressing. The dressing was my least favorite item . I didn't find the dressing too moist as others have complained, but rather dry and didn't stick together too well. Also I don't think the ham we used was right. All together a stinko.

I found the stuffing to be mushier than I had expected. I don't know if it needed less wet ingredients or a longer baking time. Overall, it wasn't bad. I am not a big stuffing fan and I ate this. The flavors worked really well with the Herb Roasted Turkey w/ Cider Gravy that it was paired with.

This was recipe was disappointing to say the least. After doubling the quantity of bread and baking time, the stuffing still came came out soggy, more like a cross between an salty apple cobbler and bread pudding. I would recommend halving the quantity of both the apples and onions. Finally, I would suggest buttering the bread cubes before baking them to prevent turning them into crumbs while mixing in the other ingredients.

I made this for Thanksgiving, but didnt particularly care for it.
