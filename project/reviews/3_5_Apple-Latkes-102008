I thought this recipe was fantastic - will incorporate it into the family Chanukah tradition. I added cinnamon to the sugar for sprinkling over the fried apples. Next time I will try increasing the amount of flour in the batter for a more dense "breadier" batter.

Much too oily and not delicious enough to warrant the effort (e.g., macerating)
