The perfect dessert for my dad's 82nd birthday! Used Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia Ice Cream. My dad and I loved it, my husband would have rather had plain vanilla. The sauce was unbelievably delicious! It might have been a little thick due to my error, but so delicious and no one complained. I think the orange really enhanced the sauce. I used a garnishing tool to make match sized strips of orange zest right from the orange, which was okay, but next time I will just use a zester and grate the zest of one orange instead. I didn't have a vanilla bean so used extract. Can't wait to try it with a vanilla bean. I choose chocolate desserts whenever possible, but this one is just to die for.....could have been the combo with the Ben and Jerry's, too!

Made this for a pot luck, and everyone liked it. I added a 1/2 stick of butter to a triple recipe, and it really helped smooth out the flavors.

I liked the orange peel, but didn't feel the finished product was worth the time and effort.

I did not make this but attended the luncheon where it was served. So delicious! The orange peel makes such a difference.

Well! I tried this twice with the frozen cherries and each time the cherries were just a little blah so I found a can of Oregan Brand bing cherries in a heavy syrup, they were just perfect in this dish, also I put a very small slice of chocolate cake in the bottom of the glass, then the valilla ice cream then served the cherries on top ..YUM!!!!

Loved it - would make it again and again if it wasn't so fattening. But i love dessert, easy to make and delicious with vanilla ice cream - yummy!!

This was a wonderful ending to a festive meal. I flamed and served it at the table. Only problem, the sauce was a bit too warm and melted the ice cream pretty quickly, but still tasted wonderful! Very well received.

So wonderful, I looked it up to serve again. I also used some leftover sauce in some plain yogurt. Yum! Kids love it too!

I prepared this for our Christmas Supper club dinner and it was a hit...perhaps more for the presentation than for the taste. I did think it was very tasty, but the flaming of the brandy was the most fun. Highly recommend for its simplicity and presentation!
