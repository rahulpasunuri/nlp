YUMMY! The dijon in the dressing and on the pork really make this dish. Great for summer picnics. Don't forget the lemon wedges - adds just the right amount of brightness. This took me a little longer than 30 minutes due to frying the pork in batches.

This is a great recipe! Crispy and delicious. Make sure to trim fat around the edge and then pound to 1/4" thick and tenderize. The only tweak I applied is I dredged in flour prior to the egg mixture so the panko adhered better. Make sure to buy katsu sauce for dipping or worcestercire/bbq can be substituted. YUM!

Overall very tasty. The salad was the star of this recipe. I think my pork was too thick and my panko too course, causing me to have to cook the pork longer, which burned the panko a little.

This is an excellent recipe. Easy to make. I was skeptical about the watermelon/tomato salad but it was delicious and refreshing, a perfect complement to the pan-fried pork. I made the tonkatsu sauce using a recipe from Saveur.

It really was easy to make (especially because I bought watermelon pre-diced), and SO tasty for the effort/ingredients required. I didn't have much parsley in the garden, so I supplemented liberally with fresh basil, which turned out to be awesome!

This is a great summer/end of summer meal. I've made it with both chicken and pork - think the pork was a little better. Make sure you cut up the lemon - it makes a big difference. I cook up extra and my kids love to take it in for lunch the next day.

This was fantastic for a summer dinner! The flavor of the watermelon combined with the tomatoes sounded a little weird, but it was great. It is also very fast and simple to make. Don't change anything!

Everyone loved this dish. Nice change from chicken cutlets. Added fresh parsley to the panko crumbs and increased the amount of mustard in egg wash for a little more zing. Salad worked perfectly with the pork.

Great summer dinner. The salad was fantastic! Sweet, meaty, and flavorful. The pork tonkatsu was also perfect. I normally am not a fan of panko bread crumbs for "schnitzel", but the addition of the mustard really gave the pork some real substance. A new favorite recipe.

This was a BIG hit. Followed recipe exactly. Very simple to make. Pounding the chops to 1/8 inch took awhile, but all worth it.
