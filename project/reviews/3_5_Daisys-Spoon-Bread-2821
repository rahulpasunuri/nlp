I haven't tried the recipe yet.. but I am intrigued by it. I am in search of a Daisy bread recipe. My great-great grandmother..named Daisy (go figure, haha) made Daisy bread but I am just trying to figure out what Daisy bread is exactly. I have found a few things and a few recipes but still not sure. If anyone could help..that would be wonderful.

The texture of this spoon bread was nice and fluffy but it was fairly bland. The recipe could benefit from additional salt or maybe some cheese mixed into the batter. I added some diced red pepper and would do so again.

This is definitely a 4 star recipe! I have been making this for years and have brought it to potlucks, everyone devoured it. I don't know what happened with the previous review as I follow the recipe exactly and use just the cheapest cornmeal on the shelf. I do however add a can on diced green chilies. Please give this a try, you won't regret it!

Was trying to duplicate spoon bread we ate at restaurant. This was almost there, but not quite. I will make it again, but substitute a finer ground corn meal - used Quaker Yellow Corn Meal which was a little too gritty for our taste. I would like it to be creamier--guess I'll try half & half instead of milk. Any other suggestions out there?
