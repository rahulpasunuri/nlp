This was a great recipe to a classic Greek dish which is made with eggplant instead of the potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly but added cinnamon and nutmeg to the meat mixture and a dash of nutmeg to the topping. Perfect. I will try using this topping the next time I make Greek moussaka. This topping was easy and tasted great.

This is good comfort food but it can be spiced up a little bit. I sometimes make Turkish potato moussaka which is almost similar to this but has also marjoran, bayleaf, thyme and green pepper in it (but no cheese which definitely is a tasty addition).

I forgot to buy the onions, so made without. It was missing a flavor I think it really needed, so not recommended without onions. Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed croutons, which added a really great vinegar & spice flavor to it that it really needed. Was far too greasy, particularly with those potatoes. Unless you have a deep fat fryer, it's very hard to turn out good fried potatoes anyway, so I don't recommend you fry them without one. In the past, I've taken pre-cooked potato slices and lightly pan fried in small dollops of butter, which cuts a little bit of the grease out and has the same effect.

Croatian moussaka has potatos instead of eggplant but they are not fried. They are traditionally boiled a littl ebit before baking the dish but could probably be steamed like one the other reviewers mentioned.

My husband is from East Germany and he loved this dish. I have been to eastern Europe many times and the food is always tasty and harty but if you are looking for tastebud popping spice you won't find it. Spices are subtle in this cuisine. The only change I made was to fry the potatoes in olive oil instead of veggetable oil to try and make it a bit healthier and I drained the cooked beef very well of all it's fat. I will definately keep this one in our rotation.

I couldn't stomach the idea of all those fried potatoes, so I left the skins on for texture, sliced them as called for, and steamed them instead, which worked very well. Also substituted veggie ground round. The resulting dish was tasty but didn't make my short list of dishes that are wonderful enough to justify multiple stages of cooking. This one falls into the category of Too Much Work for me.

This was a FABULOUS recipe! We added a little more salt and pepper (just because we like a little more) and were very happy with this dish. We will definitely make this again!

I've tried this recipe and it did not taste nearly as good as I expected. I will not make this dish again.

too much fat for folks having to watch medical diets.

This was OK but a little insipid - I will make it again but using marjoram, oregano and rosemary from my herb garden. I halved the amounts and left out all the breadcrumbs - it is better to thicken the meat sauce by reducing it.
