This was a very interesting Chili. Really I should not have made it as I do not like cinnamon and cloves but it was so interesting I could not resist. I was unable to enoy it for that reason but others really did. I will try it again omitting those 2 spices.

Great chili recipe for a change of pace. I add the beans in (canned black beans) rather than serving separately. Love the way the raisins swap their flavors with the rest of the ingrediants. If you are making ahead, do wait until the final heating and serving before adding the olives and almonds.

Rating: 3
This is so darn delicious and different. Changes I made: Added a rinsed can of black beans during the last 30 minutes of cooking (instead of adding to the top...didn't really "get" that) and used a combo of ground turkey and beef. Next time, I'd add the raisins about ten minutes before it is finished cooking. They completely disintegrated after cooking for an hour, and I would have liked to taste them.

At last an interesting chili that isn't just about heat! This has lots of interesting flavours in it, and they all work well together, especially the olives and almonds. This will be my new chili recipe for sure!!

I'm not typically a four fork kind of person and I have to admit that I haven't made this recently but after having made this for seven years in a row for Super Bowl I let friends know that I was doing something else. The response was that if I wasn't making this they weren't coming. I quadruple the recipe and have yet to have a tablespoon of leftovers. I do substitute diced tomatoes and dark beer for the broth and I double the quadrupled spices. I typically add the beans in for simplicity and haven't done the rice for a few years just to make things easy. A hit with our crowd!

At work we were having a chili cook off, so i found this recipe. I thought....hum different but different enough for people to love it! So i made it and like others sub. beer for the broth and just added the black beans in the end. Everyone LOVED it! It was like a game them trying to guess what was in it. The ingr. really blend together well and is a nice alternate to your regular chili. I came in 2nd in the contest but everyone keep telling me this should have won 1st place!

This is my new go-to recipe for chili (although "Halftime Chili" will always hold a special place in my heart). It's filling but doesn't make me feel heavy after eating. My boyfriend and I *love* the sweetness of the raisins mixed w/ the saltiness of the green olives. And the almonds give the otherwise soft texture a very satisfying slight crunch. Perfect on cornbread. Like some other reviewers have said, you could easily increase the amount of veggies. Will be making it AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.

Rating: 3
We made this dish for superbowl Sunday and everyone seemed to like it. I wasn't bowled over by the flavor because the cloves overpowered the dish. Next time around I would omit the cloves,allspice and put the raisins in before serving since I couldn't taste them because they cooked too long. Also, green olives do not go with this dish! I would omit or substitute black olives.

Rating: 4
This is the best chili we have ever made. Occaasionally try other recipes but keep coming back of Havana Moon. This only change I consistently make is to substitute ground meat for chunks of pork and beef, simmer meat spices and tomato for ~4 hours for perfect flavors.

Rating: 4
One of my favorite meat recipes. Make a day ahead - the flavors mingle better and you can remove excess grease from the top. There's enough flavor that you can get away with adding veggies (zuchhini, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc.) during the reheat process and cook only until tender.

Entered this in an office chile contest. Didn't win the prize, but judges went back for thirds. That's prize enough.

This was a surprisingly big hit with everyone in my family - kids included. It is really simple to make and other meats could easily be substituted (like ground turkey). It has all the fun and complexity of flavors of chili but is actually lighter and a little sweeter. I recommend it and intend to keep it as a family regular.

made this for my husband and a group of friends. everyone loved it! instead of pork i used ground turkey for a healthier touch, and i left out the olives (i'm just not an olive fan). they all loved the raisins- something very unexpected and delicious in chili.

Fixed this for a Mardi Gras lunch after the parade and it was a great hit. Served the olives separately (not necessary to recipe) and added a bowl of sour cream to garnish the black beans. Definitely a keeper.

After trying this recipe last year this is now the only chili I make. My husband raves and my 20 month old gobbles it up. I gave it to my mother in law and it is now a staple on her table too. I follow the recipe as written but leave the rice. Amazing flavour and aroma. .

The mix of flavors and textures is just fantastic in this chili. My wife loves this and we have had it several times. It is reminiscent of the chili here in Cincinnati with its cloves, cinnamon and allspice. I may add a bit of bittersweet chocolate to the next batch which is another ingredient in the local fare.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful. The only change I made was to increase the onion, toast the almonds and add the black beans (one 14 oz. can) to the stew and did not bother with the rice. Excellent recipe. Tastes like empanadas! I also did add one minced jalapeno. A keeper!

yum yum yum. i stayed in last night and made this chili. it was comforting and delicious. the smells that waltz through your house while this simmers on the stove are worth the trouble alone! love the almonds for the texture, and the olives and raisins are a nice yin and yang.

in 10 years, this is only the fourth time i've given 4 forks. wow! you won't believe how fragrant this smells: what us cooks live for!. i followed the recipe quite closely, making just a few minor (imo) changes: 1. only had 1 lb ground sirloin, and that was quite enough meat. 2. added spices next to browned meat and veggies and stirred for a few minutes, to allow flavors to come out in the fat. 3. opted for pink beans, and added to the pot at the very end, with the olives. 4. skipped the almonds. for those who may be unfamiliar with this combination of ingredients -- chili-type ingredients, plus raisins and green olives -- it's clearly derived from picadillo. if you like this recipe, you'll also like the "Picadillo Tacos" on this site (or maybe not--i got it from Sara M. on tvfn, citing Gourmet as the source).

Wonderful non-traditional chili! I made two batches. I made strictly following instructions and it turned out good. I slightly altered it for the next batch. I added fennel and sage to the ground pork, added some of the juice from the tomatoes, used golden raisins, and diced the olives. Served to small group and they devoured it. Very good.

We used this recipe in a Chili Fest contest, it won!! Everyone loved it and it was a twist on the usual chili recipes. We substituted beer for broth, used golden raisins, used turkey instead of pork, doubled the recipe with no issue and cooked it the night before so that the tastes could mingle. Delicisou1! Serve it with sour cream, chopped up cilantro and scallions and pita pockets for dipping.

Excellent recipe. I used cubed stew beef and pork instead of ground, and substituted 12 oz beer for the broth as many have, went heavy on the spices and skipped the salt, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. Cooked several hours until the meat was tender. My husband loved it, will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Without a doubt, the BEST chili recipe I have ever found. I made this for Cinco de Mayo and people went crazy, several left with the recipe. The spices remind me of Cincinnati chili that is so popular here in Ohio. The raisins (I used golden) and the almonds give it a unique sweet crunch. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
This was so good! I rarely give four stars but this is such a fun and unusual recipe I had to give it high marks. I have a chili recipe I've used for 15 years but I think I've found a replacement. It's on the mild side, which makes it great for families, so serve it with a great bottle of hot sauce for those who need more heat. Everyone at our table loved this from 16 months to 40 years old! The meal was full of "Hey! I got a raisin!" comments and the nuts give it such a great texture. I too used hamburger and turkey. Loved it - will make this over and over again!

I lived and worked in Key West, FL for about 5 years and PICADILLO was pretty much de riguer on most restaurant menus as well as conch chowder and conch fritters and key lime pie etc... This recipe for picadillo sounds okay, but Cuban food is basically just Spanish food, so try to keep the Tex-Mex out of this recipe. Forget the cloves and cumin (although the Moors brought the sombrero and cumin to Spain, omit it anyway :)) If you can find true sultanas, use them instead of raisins, or AT LEAST use golden raisins! Other than that, this recipe is very Cubano :) P.S. Sultanas are dried currants.

This chili is just wonderful - guess it's the sweetness of the raisins. And biting into an almond is a pleasant surprise. This is a keeper at my house.

Made this for a New Years eve party and it was a hit. Followed prior comments and used ground turkey & beef and added the beans right in to the pot at the end. I thought it needed a bit more heat so added 1 habanero pepper. Served it with a cheese fondue, french bread and beer. Yum.

Rating: 3
I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 beef and nobody was the wiser. I also used more onion and garlic than recommended and followed somebodys recommendation for using crushed tomatoes which made it so easy. This was a wonderful, satisfying and fragrant dish. It was great the first day and then after. A latina friend said it was even better than picadillo and the spicing added a gourmet touch. The black beans and rice with a dollop of sour cream made it that much better. You will enjoy this dish if you make it.

This is the best chili ever. I went to a chili party where there were several types of chili, this was all gone and people didn't touch the others. Give it a try, you won't make any other recipe again. I now skip the rice and black beans, as it is great in its own, but either way, it is a real hit!

I reduced the chili powder, and before serving, strained it to make it less soupy. We loved!

Rating: 3
This has become a standard dish in our dinner rotation--very hearty and satisfying, but with enough complexity that it doesn't get boring. I like to substitute crushed tomatoes (strained) for whole tomatoes, which gives a more robust base and lets the flavors blend. We've made so many other substitutions (pecans for almonds, chicken broth for beef, habanero for chili powder) and it's always turned out well. It's a really forgiving recipe, and usually better the second or third day.

I make this chili for my family and friends and they love it!!!

Rating: 4
Good stuff, but like any cook, I've modified it a bit. I've made it a few times and I double the onion, double the garlic (at least), halve the clove and added additional heat by way of Thai chilli sauce. I skip the olives and add in the black beans after 1 hr of cooking; saves room in the fridge, saves time when you're eating leftovers and doesn't compromise the flavor. Keep the rice separate until you serve.

Rating: 4
I didn't have all the ingredients to make this chili so I used it as a sort of "base" to start from. I used veal instead of beef and pork which gave me less fat but since I didn't have any broth handy, I just added water and it worked great. The spices used are decidedly Arabic in flavor (allspice/cinnamon combination) so since I didn't have any cumin, I added some Kibbe spice. I also loathe raisins so I substituted some diced mild apples (skin on). I also added lime juice and cilantro, green chiles and cut the chili powder in half since I was adding some fresh jalapeno. I guess I really can't call it Havana Moon Chili anymore.. but dang it was good!

I wasn't sure what to expect. Was easy to cook and turned out DELICIOUS! I'm not sure what happened with the cook below. It wasn't a particularly spicy-hot chili, but it was a very deliciously flavored chili--very unusual, but definitely fantastic. Will make again and again.

SEND THIS CHILI BACK TO HAVANA!!! I hate to break the 4 and 3 fork reviews, but such is life. I followed the recipe quite carefully -- intrigued by the odd combination of ingredients. In the final analysis: I am not glad that I did. Very timid tasting chili. Weak sauce. AVOID!!

I loved it's smokey name, I loved it's spicey earthy scent while it was cooking. I loved the exotic cummin, the sweet raisins, the hot chili, the salty picante olives, the texture of the almonds- and it looked interesting and inviting too - However unless you are a true blue bean person, I would not offer guests a "mound" of black beans with this wonderful chile - l Tbls over the rice went well for us. This will be served to my sons when they are visiting in Winnipeg from their homes in Quebec and Texas

What a fabulous chili! I'm making it again for a casual dinner party. I highly recommend you make it the day before and then keep it in a crock pot on low for the whole day that you will serve it -- it really melds the flavors together and greatly enhances the recipe.

I made this chili for my church's Chili Dinner fundraiser, and it was the hit of the night. Everyone loved it, and it went the fastest of all the chili's served. I made just a few minor adjustments, added a bit more onions, 1/2 Tbs. more chili powder, a sprinkling of cayenne, and used golden raisins. I used the beef broth. I also added the black beans to the pot for simplicity, and served it over rice. I let it simmer a bit longer, and kept the lid on to keep from losing too much moisture. The spices were interesting and delicious, and not as weird as I'd thought they might be. To be honest, you could use a larger quantity of the spices without overpowering it. Don't leave out the almonds either, it was great having that crunch. Enjoy this one!

A nice change from standard chili recipes, if there is a standard. 1/2 cup of onoin is'nt enough for a bowl of cereal let alone chili so I used a big one. Substituted beer as many have done and used a little beef extract. Added the washed and drained black beans to the pot. Rice and Chili is too wierd for us. My wifes killer cornbread is a must. People will eat this and smile.

Very complete recipe and very inspiring if you don't want to walk the beaten chili-tracks. I particularly liked the black beans, the raisins and the almonds. I also added some capers for a bit of extra zest (which I'd learned from another chili-recipe: South American Picadillo, which is also very worth while).

Super! I went heavy on the spices, added more olives and raisins, added a dash of chipotle chile powder, and used all ground turkey due to various guests' dietary restrictions. I made the entire thing the day ahead, kept the dutch oven covered in the fridge overnight, and then just reheated it before supper. Served with the Cuban Black Beans and onion-garlic "white" Mexican rice on this site, as well as with a lovely avocado-onion salad in lime dressing, it was a great, different, and easy meal for company.

I have to agree with the reviewer from Winter Park. I, too, found this chili rather bland, although my husband & daughter both enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly & was rather disappointed by the outcome. It was very easy to put together but just not very exciting or memorable. Not a keeper for me.

The mixed reviews seen here match the feedback I received when I prepared this recipe (doubled) for a Super Bowl party. My husband and others loved the unique flavors, but I (and others) found it rather bland. Definitely better when you left flavors mingle and day or two. Heh, just make some jalapeno sauce available and everyone should be happy.

I love picadillos and have made many of them. With this recipe, the expected subtle blend of spices is just plain missing. The hot spices, especially the cinnamon, were overwhelming and had an unpleasant "raw" taste. Even serving with a sharp sofrito didn't help it much. I followed the recipe exactly except for eliminating the pork and using only beef. It's doubtful I would mess with this mess again, but I would definitely half the spice quantities.

Very different and tasty chili - I added the black beans with the rest of the ingredients and served over rice - it was a hit!

I love this chili, and my picky husband gives it a thumbs up too. I doubled the beef, omitted the pork and almonds, and added the beans to the chili while cooking for simplicity. For my first batch I reduced the chili powder b/c it was for folks who don't like spicy food; if you do this, then I recommend reducing the cinnamon as well. The cinnamon and chili powder balance each other nicely, and the cinnamon flavor was too strong w/o the chili powder.

My husband really likes this dish, I've made it so often I can do it without looking at the recipe! Some pointers: use golden raisins for the sweet zing, and don't try to subsitute whole chopped almonds (the skin comes off). Freezes well - add the almonds and olives after thawing. This is a very nice dish - always well received.

I gave this chili 4 forks because of its individuality. I still had to be a little heavier on the spices and add some heat(hot sauce, not tabasco) and it might have been even more wonderful with a roasted hot pepper or two if added before simmering. Great cuban flavor and I will definitely make this again.

Excellent. The cinnamon and cloves really give it a unique flavor and I can't imagine leaving out the rasins, olives or almonds either. I added a jalepeno and a dash of hot sauce for heat, but it really didn't need it.

This recipe struck me as interesting, and being that a few reviews said that it was sweet, I was prepared to add more salt. As it was made however, the chili as a whole wasn't too sweet, but it was the raisins that were sweet. I found that if you let the raisins sit in the chili overnight, the raisins eventually lose the sweetness and absorbs the chili flavors. GREAT chili... Highly recommended!!

Fantastic! This isn't your traditional chili and it is sweet as others have mentioned, but the interesting mix of ingredients makes for an amazing meal. I wouldn't change this recipe except for the beans-I used kidney beans. My kids really loved this one too!

This dush is an interesting use of a mexican or South Amerucan picadillo. Be aware that it is sweet and not very hot, so an addition of some cayenne will be necessary for those that expect a spicy chile.This dish can be made with drued tart cherries to substitute fopr the raisins with good results.

One of the most fun things about this website is reading the reviews, hints and suggestions made by other cooks! We could have an international progressive dinner party . . . This is a terrific recipe and, like nearly everyone else, I made my own changes as well. I combined the beans with the other ingredients at the end of the cooking time and added a little more heat with some Cholula hot sauce (don't you love that name?) The next time I make it, I'll leave the almonds out - they weren't awful, but my husband and I agreed that, for our tastes, they added nothing to the dish. The raisins and olives gave it a kind of picadillo kind of flair.

Rating: 4
I had to omit all the great sounding ingredients like the raisins, olives and almonds because I knew my small children would not even put the spoon to their mouths. And it was still really good. We used beer in lieu of the beef broth and of course went way easy on the chili powder. This was a nice tasting spin on the old chili recipe. My husband loved the beans and rice and I skipped the beans altogether for my picky son. I am so looking forward to the day I don't have to edit all the spice and exotica from every recipe so my kids will eat things.

I followed the suggestions of 1/2 teas. cinnamon and beer rather than beef broth. I'll reduce the raisins to 1/4 cup next time and keep 3Tbsp of pasilla chili powder rather than just 2. My kids and husband loved the whole combo, rice, beans, meat. It is great and certainly no standard chili.

It's amazing to me that people would not anticipate a unique version of chili with a name like Havana Moon. This is not a recipe for standard chili so if you're looking for standard homestyle chili see Betty Crocker!! My husband and I loved it! The flavors were wonderful and interesting. I substituted ground turkey for the pork and next time may reduce the amount of cinnamon. Don't leave out the olives or almonds and don't mix the bean and rice in the dutch oven. Most interesting presentation is per the recipe! Enjoy.

Like others, I wouldn't consider this a true chili and made some changes. I used beer instead of stock, added 2 T. brown sugar to the vinegar/spices mixture, substituted diced, baked yam for the raisins, added black beans and omitted the nuts. I ate a big bowlful as soon as it was done and look forward to more at dinner time! Hope my husband thinks it's as tasty as I do, but if not, it'll freeze well.

My friends and I thought this chili turned out very tasty. I left out the raisins and nuts and kicked up the rest of the spices a bit. The recipe was simple enough and my boyfriend and I both wanted the leftovers for lunch the next day. I am actually making this chili for my family this Sunday.

Rating: 3
This recipe is delicious. Very different especially with the addition of cinnamon. Might want to take that down to 1/2 of teaspoon if you don't like the taste of cinnamon. I also added a pinch of cayenne..just to zip it up a bit. I also used the Spanish/Queen green olives..they looked nice halved, being so large. Instead of serving over beans or rice I added two cans of beans towards the end of the cooking time- one can of black beans, drained, and one can of red kidney beans, drained. It added some color and the beans made it more like chili. Try it!!

Good chili. It is similar to a indo-texan chili that I make with ground turkey. In that recipe you put the spices in sooner in the process. I think I will make this change, when I make this recipe again.

Traditional Chiles, Chilis and Moles have always had some aspect of sweetness ranging from the slight sweetness of the tomato or chile, sweetness from chocolate or fruits to the more intense addition of some form of cane sugar. This is one of the more sweet chilis and it is a tasty one.
