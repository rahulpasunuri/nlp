I'm about to make this using dehydrated wild mushrooms from Trader Joes..Has anyone tried this? Just curious..

I served this as part of the hors d'oeuvre menu at a party with 12 guests a few weeks ago, and they were gone in about 15 minutes! I unintentionally strayed a bit from the recipe, because I forgot to pick up fontina at the grocery. I just added extra parm (not a bad problem to have I guess!) and it turned out just fine. I also brushed a little olive oil on the baguettes while they were toasting. I'll definitely save this one for the recipe box.

This was really good, and flavors develop the next day. its just not enough. Gonna try adding cauliflower, and making it in the cast iron.

This one is REALLY good. I even got someone who didn't really care for mushrooms to ask for more. Great for the vegetarian.

Excellent! I was looking for something that really showed off the true flavor of the mushrooms I was using because these were the first harvest from a kit I got from mushroomadventures.com. The kit rocks, and this recipe was perfect. Beautiful, subtle paring of the 'shrooms with the thyme. No truffle oil needed.

Made this for a very special group of friends, and modified the recipe as suggested from other reviews. We added some white wine, less lemon, and rubbed raw garlic on bread. When we tried it, we thought we'd try also roasting garlic and spreading the paste on just prior to adding the topping and broiling to give it a little extra something. Wow!! The entire platter of crostini was gone in 6 minutes!

This was a recipe we made during a class at Sur la Table. It was so good, we ate all of them prior to finishing the other dishes!

relatively easy and delicious. When I am having a dinner party I make the mushrooms and the crostini the day before (store crostini in an airtight container). Heat the mushroom mixture, spread and bake.

A perfect vegetarian appetizer! A big hit with all of our guests and my husband as well. Even the children (who were willing to give it a try) were fans! Very time consuming if you chop the mushrooms by hand, next time I will try the Cuisinart. Definitely worth the effort!

I have made this several times now and love it. I make the mixture the night before, lightly toast my baguette slices the night before also and put them in a zip lock bag. I assemble and bake minutes before serving. A very easy appetizer that doesn't look easy. My favorite kind! Very tasty!

This was very good but a tad lacking in flavor which really surprised me. Next time I might try adding a little white wine to the mushrooms as they saute. I also tried rubbing the crostini with raw cut garlic which was great..

We made this crostini once and loved it so much that we turned it into a creamy pasta dish by reducing the cheese (though not by much), adding a little splash of white wine or sherry before adding the cream/rosemary/lemon and increasing the cream by a very small amount. It makes a heavenly pasta, especially with some roasted asparagus or fresh peas tossed in. As for the recipe itself, it is fabulous. Delicious, easy, and elegant. I will make it over and over.

This is a fabulous recipe. I've made it several times, and everyone raves. When I've had some leftover mushroom mixture, I've used it to make a mushroom pizza. Delicious!

This was alright. I would suggest leaving out the lemon. I thought too much of it came through.

This is a fabulous recipe. I have made it several times, and it gets better and better. I always get rave reviews from my guests, and it has to be one of our top five cocktail party recipes.

These ellicit nonstop compliments whenever I serve them. The recipe is also one of those gems that can't be destroyed - shun the measuring cups, throw in whatever you have on hand, and these will turn out delicious. I put the leftover mushroom filling in a quesadilla the next day - yum!

Does anyone remember a mushroom and brie crostini recipe from some years back? It was excellent, but I have lost it, and would love it if someone has it and would share.

Fabulous! These delights were enjoyed by all. Try blue cheese instead of the Fontana. Wow!

This is a really good recipe. I made it with different kinds of mushrooms and it went very well with the fontina cheese.

It's wild mushroom season in the great Pacific Northwest and this recipe captures it beautifully. I tried half of the sliced baguette untoasted but my friends preferred them toasted as specified here. I thought the cream was critical to overall texture. Since I had inexpensive access to chanterelle mushrooms, I used more of them than the other two. Still, a fabulous, easy, unusual 4 fork recipe that I will make often.

I trialed this recipe the other day with just ordinary mushrooms and it tasted pretty dam good. Ive been tryin out recipes that i may incorporate into my Christmas lunch and I'm difinitely going to use this one as a starter. I know my Mum is going to love it :)

If the chef from San Rafael, CA would have followed the recipe she would have rated this 4 forks. How does one substitute Sherry for whip cream. It doesn't make sense. This was delicious!!!

This recipe is fabulous. I have served it many times at dinner parties and it is always a huge success. It has a ton of flavor, if you make it using the mushrooms suggested in the recipe. I add more garlic.

Okay, in a is-that's-all-there-is? kind of way, but nothing special. My guests left quite a few on the platter. I substituted sherry for the cream, which I think improves it, but not enough.

This was delicious. I prepared it for an annual progressive dinner for an appetizer.. I substituted Asiago cheese for the Fontina and it was scrumtious. This will definitely be repeated several times!

Didn't make one change, though next time, sa in the photo, I would use a little frsh rosemary for garnish. De-lish just as it is, yet again, since mushrooms and sherry are a match made in heaven, I might add a little sherry while cooking the muchrooms next time. Yum!

Another big hit at a party. I made this one along with the Fig and Goat Cheese Crostini on this website. Both were gone in minutes! I did substitute Morels for the Chanterelles as they were out of the latter. Also used Havarti in lieu of Fontina for the same reason. Personally, I though it needed about twice as much rosemary. The trick to the mushroom crostini is to use the skinniest baguette you can find. After slicing it, cut those slices in half again to create a bite size crostini. And definitely toast them a bit to crisp them up (after all, it IS crostini!). A word to the mushroom novice -- this can get to be a pricy dish but it's worth it. Had just enough mushroom mixture left over to toss into an omelet this AM for hubby. HE LOVED IT.

I used oyster, shitake and white mushrooms because that was all I could find and it came out delicious. Next time I think I will add thyme instead of the rosemary, but that is only because of my personal preference.

Okay, I know you people hate those of us who change things, but I went with things I had on hand...Subbed out half butter for all of the oil, used all fresh regular shrooms, added a splash of sweet Marsala while sauteing, used sour cream instead of whipping cream, and fresh tarragon in place of the rosemary, and left out the lemmon peel. WOW! Definately turned it to a 4-forker!

I toasted the bread for only 5 minutes, and it turned out perfectly. My guests raved about it and asked for the recipe. I will definitely make it again!

I followed the recipe to the "T", but found the finished product very bland in taste

It's an easy and delicious recipe. I only used two types of mushrooms, and it turned out equally well. Toasting the bread before placing the mushroom mixture on top is great because it prevents the bread from becoming soggy.The trick is not to toast it for too long. (Do not let it brown too much.)

Enjoyed this appetizer but not sure I would toast the baguettes again. It made it a bit difficult to eat. Easy to make.
