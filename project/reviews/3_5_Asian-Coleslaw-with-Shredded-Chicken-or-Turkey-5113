LOVE this recipe! Omit the sugar, and you've got the perfect South Beach friendly meal. As much as I love cilantro, surprisingly, it really doesn't add as much to the dish as the celery does, so I am not compelled to include an entire cup. Be sure to add roughly chopped peanuts. Enjoy!

I wanted to make an Asian-style coleslaw to go with braised shortribs, and was having a really hard time deciding on a recipe. I used the dressing from this one (I thought the soy sauce came across too strong so I doubled the lime juice, ginger and vinegar), and it was amazing. I also used a packaged coleslaw mix with cabbage and carrots (Whole Foods has organic ones for under $3), added sliced red peppers, cilantro, green onions and chopped peanuts. It was so, so good, and really easy to make. The acid level was exactly what I was looking for, and this will make it into my regular salad rotation! Highly recommend!

Although this salad did little to improve the dryness of my leftover turkey, it was excellent nonetheless! Definitely add sliced red pepper (for color) and peanuts (something about the combination of the asian flavors with peanuts that I love!)

excellent, although i definitely agree that you shouldn't dress it til perhaps 30 mins ahead  gets too soggy. i made it with chicken breasts that i grilled, marinated with the spicy asian marinade from this site. delicious!

Next time, and there will be a next time--it is very good--I will toss the salad only within an hour of eating it. It lost too much crunch preparing it even two hours prior. Also, I added julienned red bell pepper and carrot, for added color and more nutritional value. Plus chopped peanuts. This is a definite "keeper" of a recipe.

I tried it with roast turkey breast and it was wonderful. I used a 16 oz. bag of coleslaw mix instead of a 1.5 lb. head of cabbage, and it still made more than 4 servings. Healthy, easy, and delicious- my ideal kind of dish!

Whoops! I wrote the review below, and I meant that I substituted carrot for celery.

I made this as a side salad, left out the chicken and went heavy on the ginger. I also substituted carrot shavings (done with a peeler) for the red peppers, and scallions for the onion. It came out very well. Definitely improves with time. It was better the next day, and I wish I'd made it more in advance of dinner. I was glad for the info from another chef that the dressing seems like too little at first, but it's actually the right amount.

A good base but way too much soy sauce. I cut the soy to 2T and added 2T of tahini. In addition, I added julienne carrots and red bell pepper and toasted sesame seeds the results where fantastic.

I've made this dish many times. The dressing is great. This is a fantastic dish to bring on summertime picnics and such.

I loved this salad, light and delicious. I sauteed ground turkey with a little onion and ginger, which gave it extra flavor. I served the salad mooshi-style with steamed rice paper wrappers.

I omitted the chicken in the recipe and served it as a side dish w/ Spicy Hoisin Chicken, Jasmine rice and Cucumber & Watermelon Salad. I plan on using the leftover Hoisin chicken in the coleslaw for lunch tomorrow.

I thought this was a terrific summer meal. It was light but filling. I substituted parsley for the cilantro as sometimes the flavor can be overwhelming. Next time, however, I will use 1/2 parsley and 1/2 cilantro. My husband loved this, I will be making it often.

This recipe was great. Very similar (better) than the popular salad from California Pizza Kitchen. It was easy, even better the second day, and I will definitely make it again.

This was a great light dinner. I used napa cabbage, and substituted slivered red bell pepper and sliced scallions for the celery and red onion, which made the salad attractive and not overly oniony. In the dressing, I used rice vinegar and substituted chili-garlic sauce for the red pepper flakes. In the future, I'll use more and make it a bit spicy.

I really like the dressing in this recipe. I'm a vegetarian and so omitted the meat. I also substituted honey for the sugar and found it dissolves much easier and also used rice vinegar in keeping with the asian flavor. I've made this several times now with a few variations (chopped peanuts, sliced almonds, sugar peas and beansprouts) and it's always great. I also found when tossed with pasta, the dressing is great for a chilled asian noodle pasta salad.

Served this for company, and received rave reviews. However, the 12 cups of cabbage is a bit much - I used a half-a-head instead. Will definitley make again!

Quick, easy and flavorful. I used nappa cabbage which was wonderful. I added some shredded carrots and mandarin orange slices for color, and sliced almonds. The dressing does not seem like enough at first but once it marinates for a few hours it is just right.

I left out the chicken and served this as a side dish. I also thought the red onion was too strong and next time will leave it (and probably the celery) out.

Wonderful, crunchy delightful salad! My husband asks for this one over and over. The addition of toasted, slivered almonds is wonderful.

This recipe was a waste of good chicken. Neither my husband nor I liked it one bit and I suspect it was the overpowering taste of ginger. The soy sauce made the salad look "dirty" and therefore not appetizing. I like all of the ingredients so I'm puzzled at the outcome :(

Nice flavours but the onion was a bit strong for me. Next time I will leave it out, or marinate it in a vinegar/water solution first to weaken it.

I LOVED this recipe. I didn't change a thing. But I served it with some angel hair pasta on the side coated with a little seasame oil and seasame seeds. For me it really had an unique taste because this dish deviated from the recipes that I usually make.

Wonderful buffet recipe with not one bite leftover. Very tasty with the addition of sliced snowpeas and toasted almonds.

I love this salad. I made it for a potluck BBQ as a side dish and skipped the chicken for vegetarians and it was a hit.

this recipe is great! i made it as a part of a summer buffet and everyone wanted to take it home! the only thing i would do differently would be to cut chicken into small chunks. when it was shredded it seemed to break down. this would help it keep its shape. great combination of flavors,very fresh.

This coleslaw had a wonderful, clean taste. My husband, who does not care for cilantro, liked this recipe. Will do again

I make this salad often. It's a great dish to bring for potlucks or to make for a light lunch/dinner. I generally add thin noodles to give additional substance.

Wonderful combination of flavors for a unique taste. I suggest having it as a side salad instead of a main course.
