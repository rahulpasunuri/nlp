Seriously after years this is the BEST brisket EVER!! I am always asked for the recipe when I make it, And it' super easy... I use an amber beer and double the sauce for garlic buttered noodles and roasted broccoli on the side.

Pretty awful. All sweet, no sour. Tough after 4.5h; needs at least 6-6.5 hrs braising. So very many good comfort food brisket recipes...don't waste your time with this one.!

Rating: 1
Let me start by saying that I routinely choose 1990's recipes from epicurious over more recent entries; although I love new taste sensations, comfort food always appeals to me. That said, this was perhaps the MOST disappointing recipe I have ever borrowed from Gourmet/BA/epicurious! The brisket needs to cook for more than 6 hrs (I should have known better). The gravy/sauce was awful! Where is the sour? Only very sweet. Trust your instincts. I didn't. I trusted the reviews, and was VERY disapppointed.

For Passover you can substitute ginger ale for the beer.

This may be a fabulous recipe, but not for Passover as you can't have beer. Not because of the alcohol but because it is grain based.

This was my first attempt to making a brisket and it came out perfect! My son and husband said it was the best brisket they ever had! I used a dutch oven, which may be why it came out sooooo tender - completely falling off the fork! I was nervous because the brisket was bigger than the DO, so I just had the meat come up the sides of the DO, but it didn't matter at all. Still cooked great. will definitely be making this again!

I've made this many times now and it is fantastic each time! So tender and so easy. It's a classic and it reminds me of what my Grandmother used to make!

Hello Ame68- You may want to possible give yourself even more than 6 hours. I make this dish all the time and for that size it takes about 6-6.5 depending on your oven. When it is tender you know its done. I usually use a roasting pan covered tightly with foil and I always at least double the recipe. I'm making it again today for Passover, it is a favorite! Good luck!

I was hoping to get some advice... This recipe came highly recommended to me. I'm hosting dinner on monday for fourteen people. I have a 10 pound brisket and am doubling the recipe. Does anyone know how he larger size will effect the cooking time? I'm guessing 6ish hours but really have no clue. Additionally, any recommendations for what I should do if I don't have a ditch oven?

This recipe couldn't be easier. I use a large oval dutch oven with a fitted lid. Samuel Adams light beer worked fine; although I am sure other beers would be good too. Next time I might try a hard cider.

Question: What kind of beer is everyone using? I'm sure that the reviewers who say it is bitter, are not using a decent beer. But kind of beer is best Jan, anyone??? Thanks.

This was absolutely easy and minimal ingredients. I added two chopped apples and used a good German beer. The results were delicious. I took a tip from Molly Stevens, ALL ABOUT BRAISING, and put the brisket under the broiler for about 7-8 minutes a side to brown, worked for me. My family enjoyed every bite!

I am the creator of this recipe and have been making it for over 25 years. There is always enough (if not) too much sauce. It's your typical braising method which needs to be cooked low and slow (preferably covered tightly in the oven)in order to tenderize this tough piece of meat. Thank you all for your nice compliments, and I hope you enjoy it for many, many years. -Jan

I had never done a brisket before so did this recipe for New Years Day brunch last year. It was the 'non- traditional' item for my family as I had done some familiar comfort foods with my own spin on them. I wasn't sure how the brisket would be received. It was devoured!! There was literally one forkful left for myself and my mom. A definite winner and what we're having tomorrow for dinner!

This is my Go To brisket recipe and it never fails. I have made it MANY times over the yeras. Tonite a huge batch for 18 people and they ate it ALL with 2nds. I always saute onions, carrots and celery after searing the meat. Have to use an iron dutch oven to get it to carmlize. I add fresh/frozen craneberries as well...and some close to the end of cooking time so they hold up. Try it..so simple!

I made this last week and ended up having to throw it in the garbage. It was so bitter, it was inedible. I'm not sure if it reacted with the iron in my Le Creuset (enameling is intact) or if somehow when it was last washed it wasn't rinsed well. I'll make again, because I'm sure it was a fluke (I hope).

Third year in a row for Rosh Hashana in our house. Doubled the sauce amounts, then cooked as instructed. Refridgerated overnight to allow for easy slicing of brisket, and reduced gravy/sauce on stovetop until thick. For dinner, reheated meat (recovered with sauce) for another hour. Fantastic and the "best brisket" my Jewish husband has "ever had."

Yummy! Just bought a new 9 quart LeCrueset dutch oven for this recipe. Even though I doubled the liquids (and onion) it completely evaporated! Obviously, I need to trade it in for a new one that seals better. Even with this problem it still has an amazing flavor. I can't wait to try it again with a better pot!

This recipe is wonderful! My boyfriend begs me to make again and again and I am definitely making it for Rosh Hashana this year!! It is ever so simple and comes out just delicious. If you like it a bit sweeter, just add 1/4 c more cranberry sauce. Also double the sauce ingredients if you like to dip or to drizzle over mashed potatoes or egg noodles.

Excellent! I didn't have cranberry sauce, so I used grape jelly instead. It wasn't too sweet, as I feared it might be. DO make sure to skim off as much grease as possible before pureeing - the sauce was great and a previous reviewer is right, this is even better the next day.

I thought this dish was quite good. I added carrots, and pureed some of the sause at the end, cut the brisket which I cooked for 3.5 hrs, and then put the sauce back over it. the trick is to make sure you cook the hell out of the meat to make it as tender as possible. I would prob not puree all th sauce next time, only about half...I added extra onions which were delicious..definitely prep the onions b4 hand...it's worth it!!!

I have been making this every year since it first appeareed in Bon Appetit back in the early 90s (as I recall). It is always a big hit in our family and for company. Most people are used to brisket, roasted and smothered in onions. But this adds a fresh zip to it, without being too way out. I often add more cranberry sauce than the recipe calls for. It only enhanced the flavor. Adding some brown sugar to the sauce also is great.

Rating: 3
This is my new brisket recipe, and I've been making brisket for years. for the basic recipe I used 1 12-oz beer and one whole can (can, not cup) of whole berry cranberry sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup, then multiplied the whole thing by 1.5 to have more sauce, which was needed. I also used two large Spanish onions. 1 t salt, 1 t pepper. Don't forego browning the onions, it only takes 20 minutes and adds a lot of flavor. I cooked my brisket 3.5 hours, at the recommended 3 hours it wasn't soft enough. I had also added one package baby carrots to the cooking from the beginning. After removing the fat (when cold) I pureed all the sauce, carrots included. It was good and thick, and the sweetness aspect was subtle. No flour needed, or wanted. If you want more sweetness, add a T or two of brown sugar, as recommended below. I served it with mashed potatoes, though potato kugel or pancakes would be great as well. I also served a cold green bean salad. Wine was a Toad Hollow Zinfandel, excellent.

Rating: 4
What a terrific recipe and so simple! I added a little hot sauce to give it some zip. I cooked it at 350 for 1 hour and then 300 for 3 hours. When the meat was ready, I cooled it on a plate and then thickened the sauce with a little flour & water and returned it to the oven for 20 minutes. I will definitely use this recipe again. MK

This recipe was so easy. I made this for a buffet along with the Brisket with Dried Apricots, Prunes and Aromatic Spices (I couldn't choose, since I was making 12lbs of brisket, I made both).

I have made brisket dozens of times, but this was the easiest and most tender I've ever made. The taste is excellent. I used a bottle of Sam Adams, which was nice and robust, and I used the whole can of cranberry sauce (frankly, I read the recipe wrong!). I also lazily used a cup of diced frozen onions. This will become my new standard recipe for the Jewish holidays! (Just don't tell my MIL!)

I made this dish for Rosh Hashana dinner and it was promptly devoured.

I'm so excited to try this recipe. Thanks to all the reviewers who took the time to comment. Tonight I signed up to feed my son's High School basketball team after practice on Feb 7th. First thing I did was get on Epicurious to look for the perfect thing. They're obsessed with lasagna, and I needed to find something different. So this is it. You've never met a bunch of more appreciative meat eaters than these ballers. I'm sure I'll get on to share their comments Feb 8th...Funny how fun it can be feeding an appreciative audience. Guess that's why we're all here...

If only brisket weren't so expensive...I will definately make this again! I used a smaller 2lb roast, but kept the full amount of sauce ingredients.

Very nice dish. It certainly was easy as well. My brisket was only about 2 lbs. but I kept the recipe as written and reduced the baking time to about 2 hours. The sauce was nice and sweet. I use beer in my pot roast all the time and it acts as a tenderizer (as well as added flavor)!

If brisket is jewish manna, I came one step closer to achieving heavan with this recipe. I must admit I used Auntie Roso's suggestions-exchanging ginger ale for beer (I actually used Vernons), used onion soup mix and brwon sugar. This was the best brisket I ever made. All 5 pounds were consumed by 4 adults and one 10 year old. I just used the liguid in the pan for the gravy and it was spectacular. Thank you epicuirians for your helpful and wise variations!!!

I haven't made this specific recipe per se, but it's almost identical to my personal creation, which always gets rave reviews. Try using ginger ale instead of the beer, and a package of Knorr's or Mrs. Grass onion soup mix. Also, I use a good quality pasta sauce, such as Barilla, instead of ketchup - just 1/3 cup. Before searing, coating just with paprika (no added salt or pepper required). It's heaven.

I love to cook and I really love a great Brisket dish. This is absolutely the best Brisket I've ever had. My dinner guests couldn't stop giving me raves and many had second and even third helpings! I happen to like things sweet so I used 1 1/4 cups whole cranberry sauce and added 3 tbls. brown sugar. ( I also used 2 med-lg onions instead of 1 lg.) Either way it is SENSATIONAL!!

I made this yesterday after our evenig dinner for a Holiday staff pot luck. Certainly easy and quick to put together I must say! I did add a second sliced large onion the last half hour along with 1 Tbsp. of orange zest. The onions cook down( disappear) and thicken the sauce, so the second one gives you added texture. I served it on a bed of extra wide egg noodles, surrounded by sweet snd sour cabbage. Try it as is a "winner dinner" for guests and family.

I can't believe how easy and delicious this recipe was. Don't be put off by the sauce when you first mix it -- I was a little nervous because it was very foamy and tasted a little weird. I used two smaller briskets (about 5 lbs. total weight), doubled the sauce and onions, and left it in the oven for four hours. Oh, and be sure to use a good, really heavy Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid so the liquid doesn't evaporate. The meat came out falling-apart tender and the sauce was luscious. Leftovers tasted even better. This was the best brisket recipe I've ever made.

I gave this recipe a 3 because I generally do not like brisket. But for those occassion when brisket is a Must Have --like Rosh Hashana -- this is the ONE. It was so nice to have a change on our table and some actual flavor in our very traditional & boring meal. This one is a keeper for me.
