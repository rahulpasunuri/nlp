I have made this many times and people love it. I add a bit of Liquid Smoke for a more smokey flavor and about1/3 cup of chopped dried cranberries for color, texture and flavor.

Great flavor and easy to make. Next time I will add more smoked turkey. I used reduced fat cream cheese and lite mayo.

I used home smoked turkey and made sandwiches using this spread and some pepper jam (with jalapenos and chipotle chilies). The turkey spread was a little boring on its own, but I think the jam really spiced it up. I think it would be good with cranberry sauce as well.

I have been making this recipe for years and love it. As a general rule, I don't like cream chees/meat spreads...they tend to look unappealing, even scary...but this is so, so, so tasty! And easy...yum.

yes, this is an excellent recipe. I have made it many times and it is loved by almost everyone. I love to have leftovers to spread on a bagel half.

I wanted to use up some leftover chicken adobo, so I just put all of the ingredients into a processor and zapped them. Terrific stuff!

Our "dink" household could'nt handle a whole smoked turkey...so I searched for something to do with the excess...I made the recipe as stated except added some dried cranberries to it (soaked first). I don't think I can eat any turkey without wanting some cranberries - and it doesn't have to be the darn jellied stuff. Anywho, they ate it up so I guess it was good. I liked it - but I think when you have so few ingredients in a recipe like this - it begs for personal twists!

I've made this spread several times and it is always a big hit. I have served it both as a spread and as a filling for tea sandwiches. When I make sandwiches, I use the extra thinly sliced bread with one slice of white and one slice of whole wheat. Adding a tiny sprinkle of chopped chive to the parsley and pecan garnish is really terrific. When making the sandwiches, be sure to mix the reserved parsley and pecans (and chive, if using) INTO the spread before assembling. At a party for over 100 people, a complete stranger sought me out to get the recipe for this appetizer dish!
