Easy and great as a full meal with a side salad and nice white wine. I used goat cheese instead of parmigiano and put it on the last few minutes of cooking, in small chunks - wonderful! For those with tomato problems, use "plum" and nothing larger - I used Campari, which are larger than a cherry tomato, but not much. Cut them in half and give them a squeeze and a few hard shakes while holding over the sink to get rid of some pulp and liquid.

Superb! I, too, roasted the tomatoes longer, because I had pretty large tomatoes. Served it as a vegetarian main course with a hearty grain salad as a side, but probably would have been better as a side itself. I would definitely make it again. Great as is, no changes needed in my opinion.

This was very good, made it for a family gathering I made small tartlets (2 ") instead of one tart and it worked fine. I also added garlic and put them back into the oven for 5 minutes after assembling them. It just melted the cheese a bit. Everyone loved it!

my friend and i made these for a dinner party - the tart was quite good and lovely to look at. puff pastry is fun and easy to work with. 2 slices per person was perfect during cocktails.

Easy and delicious. Piece of cake. The only way to make this better is to use roma tomatoes from your own garden. Cheers!

I love roasted tomatoes. This was the first time I ever tried puff pastry. It was fabulous. No problems and very elegant for my dinner party. I used it as a side dish with salmon baked over potatoes with a vinegarette dressing on it. A+... and people wanted the recipe! Always a nice compliment.

This was a total disaster and a major disappointment. As an experienced cook, I made this dish based on Epicurious reviews for company. I could not even serve this as it would not cut nor would it come off the pan.

This is a delicious and unique dish. The roasted tomatoes are fantastic, and have inspired me to use roasted tomatoes in other dishes, including tomato sauces. However, my toppings did slide around a bit on the puff pastry crust and didn't look nearly as beautiful as the picture.

Having read a few other reviews, I will comment that using plum tomatoes might avoid the problems. I've made this twice and it came out perfectly just as the recipe specified. My 20-something stepkids all gave it a big thumbs up. It's so light that I like it just as one of a few appetizers for a dinner party. But definitely serve it right away.

I'm not a tomato fan generally, but this one I liked. If I was to do it again I think I would roast the tomatoes longer, as suggested by another reviewer, or do them on a grill. An easy, healthy vegetarian dish.

I recommend cooking the tomatoes longer because they were bursting with juices which makes the crust soggy. When I made it again I roasted the tomatoes about an hour longer. The tomatoes were perfect and tasty.

Serve it quickly because the crust becomes soggy in a relatively short amount of time.

I'm in the minority here, but I made this for book club last night and it was good but not great and for the first time not a person asked for the recipe. There are better uses for August tomatoes in my opinion. It did look good though. . .

This was very pizza-like, however still incredibly delicious. The puff pastry dough is nice and buttery, but I think in the future I will use this recipe as a guide to roasting tomatoes as a side dish, rather than constructing the entire tart.

This dish was easy and delicious. I slid the backed pastry into a class pie plate and topped with the tomatoes and cheese. Very pretty

Very good! Of course I could live off tomatoes alone, their my favorite food. My hubby however is not a big fan but thought this recipe was really good. I added a little garlic powder to tomatoes before roasting and to the top of the pastry before baking. Would be great for a party. The thyme really gives it unique taste.

Made this yesterday using heirloom tomatoes from the farmers' market. Also used mustard on the bottom, per another reviewer's tip. Very nice side dish, especially as it was good at room temp. Would definitely do again.

This tart was fresh and delicious. I made it as a side dish for my husband and some friends. We all loved it. I roasted the tomatoes on the grill and substituted asiago cheese for the parmesan. I served it with grilled chicken and a spinach salad. YUM!

This was very good, the tomatoes turned out delicious. Try spreading some Dijon mustard on the crust and keep the cheese for the topping. French trick. Very very nice

This was a tasty and relatively simple tart recipe. I used strawberry tomatoes. The most lengthy component is the time to oven roast the tomatoes. Everyone enjoyed this with a salad for a simple and light feeling evening meal.

I thought this was great, and even better cold the next day. I found the tomatoes roasted much faster than the recipe stated - mine were done in under 45 min.

It was love at first bite! Excellant recipe, easy to make! You make it once and your imagination will have you making this with other vegetables. Best savory tart I have ever had. This will be a regular side dish at my home.

Excellent. Initially I was a little skeptical about this dish because the list of ingredients is so simple; however, I made it using the ingredients as written and am impressed that oven-roasted tomatoes have so much flavor. The only change I made was to bake the pastry on parchment paper to avoid any sticking (although I am not sure this was necessary). Try this tasty tart - you will like it!

I'm sure this dish would be delicious just as written, but with all of the fresh basil in my garden, I couldn't resist topping it with lots of it! I also added a little roasted garlic as well, and it was the most delicious savory tart that we have ever tasted. This will be one of my favorite summer side dishes!!

This was absolutely delicious. And we made the whole thing on the gas grill with the top closed which worked perfectly and made it very very easy: roasted the tomatoes in a foil pan, baked the dough in pie pan -- both just sitting on the grill. (Confess we didn't time it -- just waited till the components looked done enough.)

Easy and does not require much active time. We liked it a lot, although my boyfriend initially thought it was a glorified deep-dish pizza by the way it looked. However, he thought it tasted very good. The mistake I made was using vine-ripened (cluster)tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, which are less juicy. The dough got a bit soggy in the middle, but fortunately the tart was consumed within 5 minutes after it was ready. Also, had leftover tomatoes, which may also be due to the wrong type.
