These scones are a little dry. However, given that there is no butter, they are really exceptionally tasty: if you're looking too make a more heart-healthy treat, this is an excellent choice if not the very best choice If, however, your aim is just a tasty, tasty treat use a recipe with butter.

Great recipe! I had never heard about the American version of scones and only ever eaten the apparently Scottish version. These are nice and light, and extra delicious when eaten with lemon curd and clotted cream. I brushed the scones with milk and sprinkled some sugar on top before putting them in the oven. I think next time I will experiment with adding some lemon zest, which will complement the lemon curd.

I'm really bummed these didn't work. Mine turned out heavy and dense, but it could have been that my self-rising flour wasn't good. Ate one and tossed the rest :(

I didn't have self-rising flour in my house so I went online and I found a good substitution; for 1 cup of self rising flour, you need: 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder They turned out great! good luck!

These scones are perfect! My fiance, who is English, was quite impressed. I served them with butter and honey. A perfect compliment to afternoon tea.

I have made this recipe several times and it always comes out great. I serve with lemon curd, jam and cream.

These just kind of work out perfectly. It helps if you are used to a vast scone lexicon-with big studded-with-goodies coffee shop kinds at one end, leaner varieties (the kind you would serve with chicken stew) like this at the other.

Maybe if you like the heavy dense scones served at Starbucks and the like these are not for you, a true lighter british version -- jam and cream are required!

Absolutely perfect. These were delicious, light, and non-buttery unlike American scones. British fans rejoice.

This recipes is awful. scones need butter. and there is nothing Scottish about this recipe either. These were dry and nasty. make the cinnamon pecan scones instead.

Very good. Instead of using the cookie cutter, formed a disk and cut into wedges. Very easy and delicious. Served with English Double Devon Cream, jam, maple syrup and pecan pieces on the side. YUM!

These are light and delicious. They have a buiscuit-like texture. I have made them several times. Once substituted buttermilk for whole milk, which was good.

Very good - not heavy and full of butter like other scones. I add currants and such for added sass.

These are the best scones! I love the fact that they are not cake-like or overly sweet or rich. They are exactly as described and perfect with a cup of tea. I don't even use butter on them, just jam.

I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS RECIPE BUT IT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A GOOD SCONE. SCONES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE SWEET NOR SOFT ...THEY ARE MEANT TO BE CRUMBLY AND A BIT HARD..YOU CAN ADD FRUITS OR WHATEVER AND THIS RECIPE SOUND TO GOOD TO BE TRUE

Simply horrible. These are not scones..they're nothing more than dry tea biscuits... If you are looking to make real scones, do not make these :(

It was awful...I used all purpose flour, and used equal amount of baking powder& baking soda.(The only difference from the given recipe.) Did I do something wrong? It tasted like metal! Just terrible. I bake all the time, it`s the first time ever I had discard everything!

I have not made this particular recipe in question however, there is a much better scone recipe on this site called Raisin Scones that was in the Bon Appetit November 1999 issue from a bakery in Cincinnati called Bon Bonerie. I use three eggs in the recipe itself not the two that is called for and they receive raves everytime I make them. They are light and buttery the way a scone should be.

I won't quiibble as to whether the recipe is authentic or not, but it was simply dreadful. Too dry and crumbley - as in, not enough butter or shortening!

This recipe is no more classic than i'm American! Oil is never used in scones, only butter and the proportion is half butter to flour.Always sift the four and rub the butter very lightly into it.Contrary to what one reviewer says, scones are almost never made with soda and/or cream of tartar because that would simply turn them into mini versions of soda bread and we eat enough of that every day in this country anyway! Never ever knead the mixture;just form it gently into a shape for cutting out.

Horrible!! I tried making these scones and thought the recipe looked like it might be dry and ordinary, so I jazzed things up and used half and half instead of plain milk and added chopped dried cherries and toasted pecans. I even brushed the tops with heavy cream and sprinkled on brown sugar before baking. The scones still WERE dry and ordinary. I've eaten classic scones while in Cornwall, UK, so I have an idea how authentic scones should taste. I'll stick with my own recipe which contains butter and buttermilk.

Perfect -- hardly sweet, wonderful straight from oven. If you don't have self-rising flour (I didn't), use generous T baking powder (3t + 1/3t to be exact, including 2t specified) plus 1/2t salt; these are the King Arthur proportions. Made clotted cream from 4oz mascarpone, about 3/4c cream, 1/2t vanilla, 1T sugar and bit of lime zest (nice touch) and served with strawberry jam. Another time, I'd try low-fat cream cheese and whole or 2% milk for clotted "cream", just to see. Yummy!

Not as good as my traditional butter variety (only 15g butter for same other quantities) However this was so incredibly easy and quick to make and my unexpected visitors loved the scones. Hubby and kids asked what happened to the usual recipe these were not as good. But hey 'you get what you pay for'

This recipe sounds a bit out of whack. I didn't make it, nor did I rate it here. The best ever scone recipe is the one from Gourmet March 1990: MINIATURE CREAM SCONES WITH CURRANTS. Tip: Contrary to another reviewer, never brush the tops of scones with egg; brush with cream and sprinkle on a few grains of coarse sugar.

this is not a classic scone recipe. but rather an americanised version...there are no eggs in classical scones, and selfrising flour is not one of the the ingredients...rather it is plain flour with baking soda and cream of tartar, salt, butter and milk or buttermilk..it is then served with devon cream and strawberry preserve..if you want the true classic recipe which is actually delicious ask gina1139@yahoo.com

I know I shouldn't send a review in since I haven't made this particular scone recipe. But wait, wait, I have a usable suggestion regardless of the ingredients you choose to use. Don't roll out the dough. Instead, use a tablespoon and build a rough-looking mound of dough. Then, finish is off, carefully, with a brushing of beaten egg and a liberal sprinkling os sugar. Your scone will be light, rather crumbly, and beautiful to see!
