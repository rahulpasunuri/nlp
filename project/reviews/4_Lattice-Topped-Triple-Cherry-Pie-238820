I didn't have any bing cherries so I used another jar of dark morello (strained ) and a little more sugar. It was amazing everyone loved it.

This pie was great! I added a handful more of the dried tart cherries because I like tart cherry pie -- my husband thought it was a bit on the tart side (he added extra vanilla ice-cream on top) but our daughter (who is 4 year old )and I thought it was perfect. I left out star anise because I didn't have it in the house, but will try it next time. This pie is a winner!

I have been searching, for years, for a really good cherry pie recipe. This is definitely the very best. It is incredibly easy to make and everyone who I've made it for has loved it. The spices are, of course, completely necessary. It's wonderful!

this was delicious! i omitted the star anise, nutmeg and cinnamon stick. i used 4 cups of bing cherries (about 1 and 1/2 lbs) fresh and pitted. i used 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla stirred into the filling at the end. this was fabulous--everyone loved it. it did not have the cough syrup taste someone described.

delicious! i did not use the cinnamon stick, star anise or nutmeg. i did use 1 and 1/2 lbs (4 cups) pitted fresh bing cherries in the recipe as well as the morello and dried cherries. i used about 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla in the filling. this was the best cherry pie i have ever had and everyone loved it. it did not have the cough syrup taste that one person commented on. it was fabulous!

I didn't follow the recipe precisely so I'm not going to rate it. I just want to say that I had a success using Morello cherries in a jar, frozen Bing cherries, and dried tart Montgomery cherries, all from Trader Joe's! This is exciting to me because I love baking but hate shopping. I'm so happy to have this recipe with easy to find ingredients as a part of my repertoire. The juice from the filling exuded while baking possibly because I didn't reduce the sauce enough or the frozen cherries added extra moisture. I also confess that I omitted the spices because I didn't want it to taste like a cough medicine. I just used 1/3 cup of sugar (came out pretty tart) and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. For the lattice top I used a pastry wheel that has a ruffled edge, and formed a "fake" lattice. Easy and pretty! Next time I will make the filling with just the Morellos and the frozen Bings to further simplify the recipe, and add some orange zest, almond extract, and maybe cinnamon for the depth of flavor.

This pie was amazing. I used a lb of frozen cherries from Trader Joes for the bings. Again it was so delicious. I did cut the sugar a tiny bit (by a few tablespoons). The cherry flavor had depth and complexity and it was a very satisfying dessert.

This pie was incredible! I had to improvise with the cherries (using dried bing, something in a can and frozen instead of fresh); still "the most amazing cherry pie ever."

The filling required much more work than a typical fruit filling and I can't say the effort was worth it. One taster commented, "tastes like cough medicine." Others agreed, "it's just okay." I'll admit I left out the spices because I thought they were too strong and better suited to an Autumn pie. Maybe that explains why others liked this so much more than we did.

This pie is SO good. Had the Trader Joe's Morello cherries. The filling was just delicious with the perfect blend of sweet and tartness. Also, it made a beautiful looking pie as well!

This is the best cherry pie filling I have ever had (or made). The tart Trader Joe's cherries are just the perfect balance to the bings. It's so good that I just bought more cherries to put multiple batches of cooked fillling in the freezer to use later. I skipped the lattice as well and did the full crust, sprinking coarse sugar on top, which gives it a really nice crunch.

I didn't make the crust (I have crust- phobia), so I'm not rating the entire recipe, but I did make the filling and found it to be out of this world. The dried cherries bring enough of a tart note to balance the sweetness of the Bings, and the combined texture is very good. I may have undercooked my Bings slightly, but I like the extra bite to the filling. I did cut back on the sugar a little bit, but had plenty of sauce anyway.

Just made this recipe for father's day and everyone loved it! Skipped the lattice top since there was plenty of dough for a full crust and sprinkled some sugar on top. Both the filling and crust were fantastic! It goes great with some vanilla ice cream and toasted almond slivers.
