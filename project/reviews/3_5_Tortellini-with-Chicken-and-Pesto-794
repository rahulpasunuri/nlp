Great midweek time saver that uses up some of that pesto you froze last summer.Adding sun dried tomato in oil and cooked French beans gives it a boost.

I thought this was fantastic! Now I have to say that I did not make the pesto recipe here because I had my own in the freezer. But what a wonderful and easy dish. This will be a keeper for us.

I used fresh basil from my garden and followed the recipe to the T. It was good; my family really liked it, but we also thought there was something missing. As much as I love basil pesto I thought the flavor was almost overwhelming. Maybe next time I'll add some vegetables to the mix. Easy to make for a quick week night meal.

This is a wonderfull recipe. I made the pesto with my own fresh basil from the garden. I made for my husband and myself. We are going to make it for a small dinner party. It is so tasty, and very easy.

The secret to this recipe is using an excellent olive oil. I was lucky enough to travel Italy this spring and came across an amazing olive oil named Sagittario. It made the pesto the best I've ever had. Love the simplicity and ease of this recipe, quick for a weeknight and my toddler loved it too...bonus! This will become a regular for us!

I have also found a way to make this dish on a busy weeknight. I mix the Olive Oil with two tablespoons dried basil, parmesan cheese and two teaspoons of diced garlic from a jar. Cook tortellini as directed, add pesto and chicken (used canned chicken from Sam's Club) sprinkle with the pine nuts and extra shredded parmesan. Quick and Easy!

My husband hated this recipe. He did not like the basil taste. Can't think of any subs. for this dish. Will not attempt again.

Add some sauteed chopped portobello mushrooms, chunks of feta cheese, calamata olives and try grilled shrimp. Serve cold with fresh grated parmesan cheese. I buy Cellantano's frozen tortellini that is usually on sale for 2.50 a bag and boil for 3 minutes.

This is a great recipe, very easy to make. My only complaint is that the ingredients are a little expensive. It's so deliecious, most people will have more than one serving and doubling the recipe gets pricey.

I tried one addition which worked out well. I tossed in some tiny plum tomatoes just before serving and served from a large platter. Also I love toasting the pine nuts first. It adds to the nutty flavor of the pesto.

This recipe can easily be nudged up to 4 forks with a few tweaks: 1. cook the chicken in something tasty, especially garlic. I added some prosciutto to the saute. 2. use more interesting tortellini - I used sun-dried tomato 3. cut the oil in the pesto a twinge, and absolutely make it yourself. it tastes so much better. I also added a bit of sun dried tomato to it. Without changes, 3 forks, with - 4. Even if you take all the shortcuts, it's still tatsy.

Deliciouso! I sauteed my chicken in extra virgin olive oil with 3 cloves of garlic! You gotta love more garlic! I also added raw pine nuts (2 Tbl spoons) for that extra little bit of texture and on the side made a tasty alfredo sauce, mixing the whole entire meal together in a large sauce pan with about 4 more spoon fulls of pesto and voila! It was a delicious treat! Parmesan chees on top finishes it quite nicely...and next time I make it, I will definitely add sun dried tomatoes for that little bit of zing and color! Cheers!

I read all the reviews and looked over a couple other pasta and pesto recipes. This one got the best response. The pesto is very good, but I will reduce the amount of oil, next time. Following others, I used half hot italian sausage and half diced chicken breast and added half a roasted red bell pepper, diced. I think sun-dried tomatoes instead of peppers would be good, too, but I still have garden tomatoes and had those quartered on the side. I think the tortelini would be too rich, so I used cellentani, a cork-screw type pasta. My husband and son loved it.

This dish was great-- I made it with fresh papardelle, and lightened it by using 1/4 of the pine nuts suggested and about half the amount of olive oil. It was still fabulous, I will definately make this again.

This was good but the second time I made it I made the pesto creamier (add 1/4 cup of heavy cream) and added grilled spicy Italian sausage as I did not have chicken. It had a bit more kick

Very good recipe. I took the suggestions below and used chicken stock instead of pasta water, and added some sun dried tomatoes. Great suggestions. Also added some lean proscuitto and tossed at pasta and pesto stage- and it added nice flavor and color. Made extra- and used for lunch the next day- it is great cold.

It's the little things.....as with all pasta dishes, serve this delicious tortellini creation on pre-warmed dishes. And authentic parmesan makes all the difference.

This was good, but I made a few changes. Suggestions: (1) Rub a little of the pesto onto 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, then grill. (2)Add a few sliced sundried tomatoes for colour. (3) Add 1/2 cup homemade chicken stock instead of pasta water. (4) Sprinkle with some toasted pine nuts to finish.

I used Knorr's Pesto mix instead of fresh. Garnished the dish with pine nuts. Next time I will probably make fresh pesto and add a little more cooking liquid as we all found the dish a little dry.

I made this dish for girls night and they loved it. I marinated the chicken with Italian seasoning then grilled it. Will definitely make this again!

I've made this both with fresh pesto and store-bought. It's much better with the fresh! Also be sure to add water when mixing the pesto into the pasta otherwise it's dry (and use lots of pesto)!

This was comfort food. We grow basil so everything was fresh and good.

The reviewer from Plymouth is CRAZY if he/she thinks this is low fat!

I made this one night for my family and a couple of friends. Everyone loved it. I think the key is fresh pesto. You need a lot of fresh basil, but it was well worth the effort!

This is a GOOD family recipe--easy, filling, low-fat and flavorful.

Excellent, sophisticated, easy and pleasing -- great company food. All you need is a fresh salad and voila! Since fresh basil wasn't available the day I made this recipe I used Knorr pesto sauce mix (regular, not creamy) and it was terrific.

Like the last reviewer, I might as well say "ditto"; did everything she did. This recipe is great for something quick and for those nights you really don't feel like cooking (which we all occasionally have!!)

Don't take my rating too seriously, since I substituted a low fat pesto sauce mix and romano cheese I had on hand, but it was still good and quick especially if you buy a roasted chicken from the market.

This is a very nice and easy recipe. The pesto was nice. I used a little of the chicken broth I had cooked the chicken in for the liquid.

I find cooking interesting meals for my husband quite challenging because he is a picky eater. I was looking for something to make for his birthday and since he likes pesto and chicken, I thought this was the ticket. He absolutly loved it and he could barely stop eating long enough to tell me again how great it was. The recipe is easy and since I am vegetarian I used portabella mushrooms for my portion and it was super.

I had cut out this recipe from the magazine in 1994 but recently misplaced it. I love this recipe and was thrilled to find it here. It's easy, quick and delicious.
