the bread wasn't very flavored and the glaze had too much lemon

This is simple and yummy. I like more of a tart lemony taste, so I used about half the sugar in the final step. The lemon really comes through!

Found this to be an average lemon loaf - nothing to write home about. I wouldn't bother making this recipe again and will continue to look for a good lemon loaf recipe.

I'm always a little surprised when others are suprised that a "bread" is sweet, when the recipe involves 1-1/4 C. sugar.... At any rate, this is moist, sweet/tart, and can't wait to add it to my list! Thank you! KIMBER

Deceptive name, but still good. This is definitely more of a cake than a bread. Better on the second day than straight from the pan as well, and sweet. I plan to tinker with using sugar substitutes in the topping, at least, or putting together some sort of glaze instead of dripping the fluid into the bread next time. Otherwise, very yummy!

This recipe was SOOOO easy--it literally took about 10 minutes preparation. However, people at the event I took it to were going crazy for it! It really was light and tart and very good--the glaze at the end really makes it something special.
