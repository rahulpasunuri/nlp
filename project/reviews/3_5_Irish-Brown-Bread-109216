This recipe is exceptional. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so used half skim milk, half heavy cream with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. Also, I put 1 tablespoon of sugar, rather than the two teaspoons and the balance was right on. I think as written, this recipe would be delicious, too. As to the technique, I made sure the butter was very cold (and even put the flour mixture in the freezer for a few minutes) and I did NOT mix it 3 minutes - only just to combine, about 30 seconds. This is the closest I've tasted to the authentic brown bread I fell in love with in Ireland. Definitely a 'must save' recipe! LOVED!

Awesome bread, easy to mix in kitchenaid with dough hook then put in pan to bake. Delicious with marmalade.

Followed the recipe with the exception of adjusting the flour as suggested by a previous reviewer (whole wheat and cake flour). I use King Arthur flours. LOVED this bread and it's so simple to make...easier even to eat. Truly a gem.

I have been baking Irish soda bread for almost 50 yrs. using various recipes. I suspect the reviewers who had a bad turnout are making a common error, over-kneading the dough. If you just mix the wet into the dry until it comes together, form it into a ball, and toss it into the pan you should have excellent results. Like biscuit dough. Over-kneading forms gluten, which makes for tough bread. Also, I often hear bakers say that they followed a recipe from an Irish person to the letter and it was a failure. Irish flour has a lower gluten content than American APF. So it is 'softer'. Try 3 cups of whole wheat and 1 cup of cake flour. Finally, I know of no Irish baker who puts molasses into his soda bread. It confuses me how someone would give a poor rating to a recipe they never actually followed.

Having just returned from Ireland where I fell in love with the dark, dark Irish bread, I found this recipe. I didn't think it was exactly what I wanted but it got such rave reviews that I decided to try it anyway. I followed the advice of others in using all WW flour and molasses but I did make a couple of other changes (probably main reason it didn't turn out so well) by decreasing the flour to 3 1/2 cups, eliminating the wheat germ, and adding 1 cup of an oat/7 grain mix of cereals. I needed every drop of buttermilk from the container and very little extra flour when I kneaded it. I also baked it for 45 min to make sure it was done. It looked lovely. What I ended up with was a huge Irish hockey puck! I will eat it all - I toast it and it's not bad with butter and jam. But, I'm on the hunt now for a yeast Irish bread that is almost as dark as pumpernickel. The waitresses in various hotels said the bread was homemade in the hotel kitchens. What I am assuming is that the hotels purchase frozen ready made bread and bake it in their kitchens. So, it might be "homemade" but it's homemade in a factory somewhere, not made by scratch in hotel kitchens.

This bread is delicious! I followed a few tips from other reviews and used my Kitchen Aid mixer, used only whole-wheat flour, and used molasses instead of sugar and I am so happy that I made the changes. I also used a loaf pan instead of the round cake pan so that the shape would be more manageable for sandwiches and toasting and it worked perfectly. I lived in Ireland for a year and this bread tastes just as good as any brown bread I had there.

Forgot to add, I too found I didn't need 2c of the buttermilk. I used 1 1/2 c., maybe a little less. And I didn't let it cool as long as suggested...(so much for making it as written...)

A good quick bread. I didn't have buttermilk so I made the milk and vinegar substitute and the recipe still came out great. I made as written otherwise and look forward to experimenting with more wheat and maybe molasses instead of sugar.

If it were possible I would give this recipe negative forks since it produced a salty baking soda flavored brick. I assume I did something wrong since everyone else had stellar results. However, I followed the recipe to a T... I have had Irish soda bread before and loved it. The horrid thing on my counter isn't even its trice removed cousin. Any thoughts?

Delicious. Not quite like Ireland, but a very yummy second. It will be a staple in our house. Also used all whole wheat flour.

I have made this so many times since I first found it, my entire extended family and many co-workers ask if I'm baking for all of our holiday get-togethers. A few things I've altered for even more delicious results, drop the all purpose flour and just use 4 cups wheat, it makes a much healthier and richer bread. Also, when in a pinch and needing more than one loaf, I found splitting the dough in half and forming each half into a 8 or 9 in pan does bakes the same yummy bread, just slightly less thick. Also, sprinkling sugar ontop prior to baking for a sweeter loaf or any fresh herbs from the garden (rosemary or chives being my favorites) for a great adddition to your usual dinner bread. Excellent wonderful recipe.

I used powdered buttermilk instead of "the real thing" and 2 Tbs of canola oil instead of butter. I made a traditional round loaf on a cookie sheet with cross cut in top. Results tasted like the same brown bread I came to love when visiting Ireland. Really excellent. I found that I needed MUCH less than 2 cups of buttermilk to make reasonable dough, I had nearly a cup left over. First loaf I attmepted, I dumped the whole 2 cups in - big mistake - made wallpaper paste.

The taste of buttermilk was overpowering.

The brown bread I remember from my trip to Ireland was very similar to this, but much darker. So instead of the sugar, I substitute 1/4 cup molasses and use all whole-wheat flour instead of half white and half wheat. The resulting loaf is deeper in color and flavor.

This is a very authentic recipe. Just had it with the Irish beef stew recipe from this site and both were knockouts at my hoouse.

Read the reviews and made this in my stand mixer but kneaded by hand. Made it the next day with 1 cup dark Rye flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour- incredible. Plan on serving this with the smoked salmon appetizer and the Guinness beef stew entree on St. Patrick's day.

An easy recipe for bread with a unique taste...a little salty like biscuits. Dense bread, fantastic with good butter, served with stew and good as toast, too! Whole family loved it.

I have made this recipe every St. Patrick's day since I saw it in Gourmet. It is a huge hit, delicious and filling. Having been to Ireland and stayed in the B&B's it brings back many memories of our trips. I mix it in my Kitchenaid using the whip to cut in the butter and changing to the dought hook when adding the liquid. Sprinkle more flour in until it balls up. Let it knead until smooth-very,quick, easy and less mess.

This bread isn't as good as so many people said it was. For me, anyway. It's very filling, so it wasn't the easiest thing to get rid of.

Surprisingly moist for a soda bread. Nice crispy crust, moist inside. Great with stew. Definately added an extra tablespoon of sugar, because it helps bring out the sweetness of the wheat germ.

Also in regards to measurements. I just dip and shake to level off and this bread turned out perfect as do all of my other baking adventures :) I think sometimes people think too hard...Just try the recipe...never know unless you try :)

I loved this bread!! I served it with Irish Beef Stew and it's simply yummy!! Simple being key. It was so very easy to prepare that I'd seriously consider making it a staple in our house. Can you imagine it as a nice Roast Beef sandwich? Delish!!! I just used grocery store butter and flour...I didn't go out of my way to get any fancy or gourmet ingredients because it doesn't have to be gourmet for it to be good. If you've been afraid of making bread before, try this recipe. I also baked it on a greased cookie sheet sprinkled with a touch of cornmeal to help with sticking, put it in a mound and it turned out just like something you'd pull from your rustic oven and serve along side your rustic stew. Definately a keeper!

I made two loaves exactly as stated and they were both excellent. Still moist on the third day. This bread is the perfect density for my taste - not gooey, but substantial. And the smell while it bakes made even my picky 4 yr old beg for a slice (which he loved).

Rating: 4
Impressive result for a simple recipe. Use best quality butter (Irish or Danish) and flour. My dough was initially very soft. Don't be afraid of putting more flour in while kneading. Mine took at least another cup.

Made exactly as per recipe except with fake buttermilk (the 2 tbsp lemon juice trick) and it is delish. Fairly solid, kind of like a biscuit, but not uncomfortably dense. Would be great with a stew. The ingredients are simple and on hand. I'll try baking it on a tray instead of in the cake pan - a cake-shaped loaf is impossible to slice nicely for spreading or eating things on, it has to be wedged. This one is going in our recipe collection.

This was very simple to make as alternative to biscuits or cornbread. I used oatmeal instead of the oat bran and with no buttermilk on hand(who keeps it handy? Sir-Mix-A-Lot for his song "Buttermilk Biscuits" perhaps)substituted 2 tablespoons of vinegar to the amount of whole milk left to sit for 5 minutes. I added the oatmeal to the milk vinegar mixture letting it steep and the texture came out divine. Served with dates and goat cheese for a easy Sunday brunch dish.

Giganto pay-off for little effort and few ingredients. Served with an Irish meal for St. Pat's, was a hit. This is very dense and moist. I had enough buttermilk to make another loaf, but I added an extra tablespoon of sugar, as it helps bring out the natural sweetness of the wheat flour and germ. Hands down, my favorite from-scratch bread recipe.

For Emily Collins - Re your printing problem: I had the same problem with this site after I started using Mcafee spam filter; it drove me crazy! If you're using a filter you might try switching to a different one to see if that makes a difference. It worked for me. Good luck!

This is to Gina. It appears that Emily Collins' problem was not that the recipes were not given in metric measurements....she simply has a problem with PRINTING the recipes. Maybe the problem lies with her printer, the server, or the site. Who knows? But I cannot see where there is any mention at all about what measurement system is used (unless I overlooked something, in which case I hope you do respond). The best I can tell,this site originates in the United States. Please enjoy our site...but... remember...we DO NOT have to adapt it for every other country.

This was really good. It had a great flavor (even though I toasted the wheat germ a little too long) and it was really quick and easy to make.

Rating: 4
I wasn't sure my family would like this because they only eat white bread but they loved it enough to ask for it again. I couldn't find toasted wheat germ so I toasted the raw stuff in the oven at 350 for about 10 mins., shaking frequently. I also added 2 teaspoons of caraway seeds. This was a great tasting recipe especially for a quick bread.

This bread was easy to make and delicious. I served it at a St. Paddy's day party and everyone raved. It's moist and dense, exactly how brown bread should be!

This is just delicious. It baked up beautifully the first time I tried it. It makes great toast and is delightful with the potted crab from the Irish menu in the March issue of Gourmet. I will admit to using King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour becuase I had it in the house. I found that I needed about 2 more tablespoons of buttermilk to get the dough to come together. I kneaded it entirely in the bowl. I also found that I needed more than 40 minutes to bake completely.

There is nothing wrong with using good,old, cups, teaspoons and ounces. Most of us don't have kitchen scales especially those people with small kitchens. Maybe the best way to bake is to be familiar with how doughs should "feel", like some one else said weather conditions can affect how much liquid is needed, etc. No amount of "micrometer" accuracy can be substituted for hands on experience.

This is not a review of this recipe, but directed to emily collins...I totally agree with you that measurements for baking should be stated in weights for solids and ml for liquids..I use the metric system which is far more accurate...I feel that recipres who dont use proper measurements, dont really want to give the recipe out or are bad teachers..I do all my baking recipes in the metric system..also I want to add that when I make wholewheat bread I do not use white flour as this defeats the purpose of the whole grain...also may I add that most commercial wholewheat flours are white flours with the brown added to make it brown...It should read on the label how it was ground...if you want to know what I mean go to a healthfood store and read the labels of diff types of whole wheat flour..the taste of the bread is totally different..

To the cook from Sonoma County :-) The amount of flour to liquid in bread can depend (but not always) on the way the weather affects the absorption process. After a bit of practice you get a feel for when the dough is right. For example, using the measured amounts in the recipe and you find the dough is too wet. You will need to add a little extra flour until the right consistency if reached. The same for the opposite - dough not coming together needs a little more liquid. Make a note of the weather if this occurs :-)

Please, will someone tell me WHY all recipes from GOURMET & BON APPETIT do not print correctly - all the lines are jumbled on top of each other, Happens on 4 different printers. thank you, I hope. Emily Collins

to the person who isn't sure how to measure flour for this recipe, every baking class I've ever taken has insisted that you spoon and scrape. You would never dip and scrape for baking because you wouldn't have the correct amount.

Does anyone know how Gourmet/Bon Appetit measure flour -- dip-and-sweep or spoon-in-cup? It annoys me to no end when food mags and newspaper food columnists fail to mention their flour measuring method. It can make a huge difference. If only they would use *weight* measurements instead there would be no question. (P.S. to the Palo Alto cook -- all the other ingredients besides flour in this recipe *are* standarized, so the flour should be too. Why? Because for newbies trying to bake this or any bread accurate measuring could make the difference between dry, crumbly bread and a tasty loaf.)

Makes good soda bread. I added dried fruit and nut mix because I had it, and it made this a little more fun. By the way in response to the flour measurement comment -- you'll know you've added enough flour when the dough has the right consistency. In this case it will be a bit sticky and moist. In general it makes no sense to give precise flour measurements unless all the other ingredients are standardized. For example the size of eggs (not used here) may vary and that will change how much you use.
