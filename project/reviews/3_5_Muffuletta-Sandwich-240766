This sandwich was really good, even though I used lower-quality ingredients (canned instead of olive bar). It was simple to make. I used a long French loaf because I was bringing it to a potluck and a long loaf made better small-portion pieces. I would make this again.

I enjoyed this - made a couple of additions. Ricotta cheese (about a cup) for moistness and some arugula.

Delicious! I especially love the olive salad. It was good as leftovers too, and the bits of celery stayed crunchy. Very, very tasty. This would be good to make ahead on a longer loaf and serve at a casual gathering. We added turkey pastrami (though that isn't traditional) in addition to the salami and mortadella, and used less meat overall.

Quite tasty! A little oily and very heavy, however, so I would prefer the olive salad as a more lightly-applied spread over a leafy filling, perhaps.

Made this for a picnic outing. Easy to prepare, great fresh ingredients. Would highly recommend. Followed the recipe exactly - came out great!
