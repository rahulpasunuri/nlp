Like most "cooks" on here, I found the two minutes and 40 cent in materials for the crust prohibitive, so I spent an hour going to the store for a frozen crust that costs ten times as much and tastes like chemicals and wet paper towels...ha...just kidding...I'd never be that lazy. This is a fantastic recipe. IDEA - up the whiskey for soaking the cherries, then use any excess liquid as a replacement for the water in your crust. Why? Hard alcohol burns off during the cooking process, so using it as a replacement for water allows the best of both worlds - a binding agent for the raw dough with a crisp, flaky final product. And speaking of crusts, I skipped this one because the sugar was up there. I'm partial of the standard pate brisee recipe or the cornmeal crust that goes with the blueberry pie on this site...either make this recipe very appropriate for a crisp fall day.

What a delicious pie! I used bourbon instead of Scotch (because that's what I had in the cupboard) and doubled the amount, as others have recommended. It was a definite hit. The cherries are fantastic.

I used bourbon whiskey instead of scotch because that is what I had on hand, and doubled up as recommended by other reviewers. This pie was absolutely delicious.

I've made this pie twice now and have found that 2T of whisky is not nearly enough. I probably used (I wasn't measuring) about 4-6 oz. I reserved the liquor that wasn't absorbed by the cherries and my husband made me a pretty mean Manhattan.

I cheated and used a store-bought crust, but it was still delicious.

A HUGE hit at Thanksgiving dinner!

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. Two additional tablespoons of whisky is a must. I also did half apples and half pears which made a nice contrast to the tart cherries. The crust was easy and everyone enjoyed it though it did brown faster than I would have liked.

Just made this for the second time but with unsweetened pastry and served with thick, creamy vanilla custard...HEAVENLY! All 6 of us agreed it was infinately better the 2nd time. As an alternative, try rum soaked sultanas or soak the cherries in brandy.

How we love clever-devils like Skuba who know better but give no better recipes!! Agree with other poster that you don't have to be mean with the whisky. Double up on the two spoons. Suggest use ONLY Scottish Single Malt and not Bourbon or Blended. Scottish singles from the West have a seaweedy/salty/peaty taste whilst central and eastern malts (the more popular) have a mellower peaty flavour PS If you drink the stuff then no ice. Only a tiny bit of water. If you are coming down with a cold then half a dram of single malt (with nothing added) down the back of the throat and then lots of herbal tea (best is nettle tea). That disinfects you and washes you out.

Not a BAD pie but there are so many others that are MUCH MUCH better.
