Love this recipe - it is a "go to" every holiday season. I make the dough, bake some crisps for Thanksgiving and then freeze a roll and pull it out for Christmas. My guests always come in the house asking for the cheese crisps. The dough is pretty messy to work with, but it's worth the effort. I have even pulled the dough out of the freezer and sliced and baked just a few crisps when guests drop over unexpectedly.

I had in my possession some wasabi sesame seeds (Roland brand) so I added those in place of the pepper or seeds. I liked it so much I added a little wasabi powder (2 tsp) to the next batch. Nice bite. Had to fix more for the party as my wife and I gobbled too many of the 1st two batches.

I have made these twice for the holidays. They were devoured at both occasions. I found them a snap to make. Used a thin serrated knife on the chilled dough and had no problem with crumbling. Substituted black sesame seeds for the nigella seed and added a little cayenne to that one.

Save yourself some time and trouble - just throw 3 teaspoons of pepper (and maybe a little cayenne) into the food processor with everything else. Excellent 'light' appetiser, handy to have around in the refrigerator for drop-in company.

It takes a strong food processor to get through this one, and I had to add a little bit of milk to get the dough to work. The caraway ones were delicious, the nigella seeds kind of bland, and I made the third bunch with cayenne, garlic powder and ground thyme. These do not do well if made too far in advance -- I had made them the day before for an office function and they were mushy when I went to serve them. I was able to crisp them up in the toaster oven, but I recommend these be baked right before serving, although the dough can be made in advance

I thought these were really good and the dough was easy to work with. I didn't use nigella seeds because it seemed too weird to eat the seeds of the flowers which sprout like weeds all over my yard. My loss, maybe.

This was an easy recipe- loved the different flavors. And tasted much better warm than room temp. However not all that impressive.

These were a great hit at Thanksgiving! I too substituted black sesame seeds for nigella and they were wonderful. I found that they really needed to be cut thin (used a cheap thin knife) and browned darker than the photo. If they crumbled while slicing I let the log warm up a little bit. But I will definitely make these again--and many friends asked for the recipe!

These were very tasty, however, they were a tad too salty. I would recommend reducing salt to 1/2 tsp. I couldn't find nigella seeds so I substituted with black sesame seeds.

Very easy and very tasty. Delicately crisp and not at all dry or doughy. Perfect any occasion. Haven't found Nigella seeds yet, so only made the pepper and caraway which were delicious. They disappeared very quickly!
