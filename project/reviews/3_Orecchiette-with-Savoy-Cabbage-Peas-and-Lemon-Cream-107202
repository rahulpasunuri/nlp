This was a lovely and light summer pasta dish. I used water infused with saffron and fresh lemon instead of chic broth. I also used whole wheat pasta. It was just fine. I will add this to my recipe box! p.s. I chop bunches of dill with sea salt and it keeps nicely in fridge for a longer shelf life.

Highly recommend, if you can find savoy cabbage (I find it harder to find in the U.S. than in England, where I'm temporarily living). I thought it needed a bit more spice, so I added 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes to the cabbage while sauteing. I preferred less dill, so only used 1 tablespoon. Served with squeezes of fresh lemon juice and parmesan. Yum.

I made this recipe along with a few other dishes when my cousin from Rome was visiting. I think she liked it more than anything I had made the whole week. She said, since I like this one very much I will eat more-and basically she made a pig of herself eating it-well not really but clearly it was her favourite. I will definitely make it again!

First time using Savoy cabbage, I thought this was delicious. Simple to make, substituted half -n- half for heavy cream and used whole wheat pasta. Light, nutritious and satisfying. My husband didn't even miss the meat component. Definitely a great base vegetarian dish and would work well with many different substitutions.

This was good (which is what the two forks means, right?). It's light and nutritious. I would personally double the cabbage and add bacon. I used the juice of 1 lemon instead of zest (hate zest) and 1 t thyme instead of dill (hate dill).

Simple, quick and easy to make--good for a weeknight when you're in a hurry to get dinner on the table. We made it with some savoy cabbage from our garden and it was very tasty. Only change we made was adding parmesan cheese over the top at the end (some saltiness helped brighten up the flavors a bit). We enjoyed the meal with a nice pinot grigio.

I added some mustard, it really made a difference! I loved this dish!

I also make this all the time. I usually use napa cabbage (and I don't saute it very long). I also make a large batch and have it for a couple of lunches. It is one of those dishes that we turn to all the time because the simple ingredients are almost always on hand.

Pretty good....turned the leftovers into soup with added chicken broth and chick peas.

I make this all the time. I substituted napa cabbage for the savoy the first time, and loved it. It's light and delicious!

The solution is to combine this recipe with that for the "pasta w/ lemon cream sauce " as the cook from NYC suggested. Use the sauce & preparation method from the other recipe, but use peas & cabbage. The results are 4 forks -- unbelievably delicious! Also, while I'm sure pancetta or proscuito are classier, but my fiance is giddy for bacon, so I used that instead to much song & applause.

I really liked this - light but still sort of comfort-food. I added some parmesan on top and that added the perfect bit of saltiness. It would also be really good mixed with lemon chicken or salmon. I didn't think it was bland at all, it was more sort of 'subtle', but addictive! Don't put in the pasta water!

thought this was okay, I guess, but it needed a good bit more punch in flavor. definitely check out "pasta with lemon cream and prosciutto" on this site if you're looking for a tasty meal. you can leave out the prosciutto for vegetarian or kosher friends, as we do, and it is always a tremendous hit.

Omitted the dill, added fresh garlic (lots) and sauteed fresh mushrooms

I am so surprised at the bad reviews. this is one of my very favorite meatless pasta dishes. such humble ingredients somehow combine perfectly and I've gotten raves from guests including little kids. so be brave, if it sounds at all appealling, give the recipe a try. the ingredients are inexpensive, so it's not much of a gamble and you might be very pleasantly surprised. I like to use bowtie pasta instead of the suggested shapes. be sure to use fresh dill -- the dried stuff awful.

Easy to make. Light and delicious. Not complex. I made mine with beef bouillon (no chicken broth). I left out the dill. At the end, I tossed it all together pasta and sauce topped it off with some fresh grated parmesan reggiano. YUM! I don't understand the "retain a cup of pasta water" statement at the end. Why?? I wouldn't skimp using milk instead of cream. Just personal choice, I guess. Overall a great weeknight meal.

darn, i saw Lydia Bastianich prepare a similar recipe on tv recently...i thought this might be it, but i'm not going near this one after the reviews. i guess her recipes are mostly proprietary. now i hafta go hunting, 'cause i have this wonderful, crazy memory of pasta with savoy cabbage and onions, captivated my imagination.

Don't do it!!! This recipe was a waste of $$$ and time. I have never rated a recipe before but this one is so bad that I want to save you from a very disappointing meal. Salmon may have helped as well as leeks, like the other reviewers have suggested, but by then you might as well follow an entirely different recipe. I am so glad the girlfriend I invited over for dinner couldn't make it. She loves my cooking but this dish would have ruined my reputation.

I thought this dish lacked flavor. Maybe with the pancetta or smoked salmon it would be good, but on its own is quite boring.

Rating: 3
Used leeks like another reviewer did and tossed with cured salmon which paired well with the dill. It is very good but it needs a little more depth of flavor and I didn't quite know how to acheive it.

My boyfriend and I really love this dish. We have it as a main course -- just cut the pasta in half and add a chicken breast. Easy and so good.

We make this on a regular basis. We use fresh English peas and also add pancetta. It's a healthy, delicious and quick meal.

I liked this recipe but agree with the reviews that say its a bit too light for a main course. I would serve it along side grilled salmon at dinner, or top it with smoked salmon at lunch. I was confused about one thing: when I conbine chicken broth and cream, I get a very watery cream sauce. I ended up cooking it down quite a bit. I'm not sure I understand why the instructions suggest reserving some of the pasta water...

Simple, tasty, inexpensive and not too heavy. Great dish to prepare after work. used 1 percent milk instead of cream, but then added a few tbs. of sour cream.

This is very good-- I agree other herbs will work well with this. I thought it made plenty for a main course the first time I made it, but my ever-hungry teenagers disagreed. I made it again last night using gnocci instead of pasta-- worked really really well, and the teenagers said they were well fed!

It is simple, quick, and a great side dish.

This dish was unusual, refreshing, light. The lemon worked nicely with the peas and cabbage. I used leek instead of scallion (as I can't get scallions in Luxembourg). I served this as a main dish following a salad starter. Next time I will use the pasta as a starter as it is a bit too light, even with the cream, as a stand-alone main dish.

Did everything per recipe, except used a mix of 1/2 and 1/2 and 1% milk for cream, and Quinoa shells instead of regular pasta shells. Turned out FAbulous for being so quick and easy! Other fresh herbs would be nice in it too...such as thyme, or parsley... The quinoa added a bit of the "gnochi style body" to the dish. So good!
