I can't wait for my husband to come home again with a plethora of trout to smoke. I don't usually have whipping cream on hand so I blended some low fat cream cheese w/ a little water- worked great and a few less calories to boot. I agree with the othere about adding more horseradish for a better kick. Warning... if you grate it in a food processor, have some goggles handy. Kind of like being pepper sprayed:)

A very good basic sauce... but I am curious how it can yield 1-3/4 cups when the raw ingredients are only 1-1/8 cups total.

The classic, basic horseradish cream recipe; substitute lemon juice for salt (a meyer lemon will lend it sweetness) and pepper is unnecessary clash with paprika in the mix. Dramatic difference when grated, fresh horseradish is used: much more pungent and aromatic! Lends itself well to creative addition of other herbs and spices (but master this basic sauce first ;-)

I have friends who need to lower their cholesterol intake, so I made this recipe the second time with NONFAT sour cream. And you know something? It was good!

Fantastic! Straight horseradish is too strong for me so I made this as a sauce for my corned beef and cabbage. I will use this sauce over and over again.

Yes with the addition of stronger horseradish flavor...it may just be me but I like my horseradish strong. Triple the ingredients level (or higher) for some more kick! A bit of flavored mustard or more garlic is also a plus for a hit to the head!!
