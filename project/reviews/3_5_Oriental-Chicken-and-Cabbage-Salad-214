This is a great standard for large groups. I make this often and use store roasted chickens. I also add slivered red peppers for color. Great for a pot luck.

I have to say that this recipe is incomplete. What do you do with the snow peas beyond cooking them in the first step?!

Make this recipe! This was a fantastic salad, so fresh and unexpected. The chicken took longer to poach (12 mins instead of 7) than the recipe said; also I used sugar snap peas instead of snow peas, and added a 2nd sweetener pkt. One addition I'd suggest is to add slivered almonds or roasted peanuts. Enjoy!

VERY good - I didn't use all the cabbage the recipe called for. I also omitted mushrooms and added cukes. SO tasty - will make often. The dressing is DELICIOUS!!

I made this but also had to modify it slightly because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used real surgar instead of artificial, just a bit.It was ok, but I think it needs some nuts of some kind, and a bit more oil or fat. And you definitely need to mix the chikcen back in!

refreshing, tasty

yummy, easy and very versatile. edamame and sesame seeds are good add-ins, sugar substitute is not necessary.

this was a good recipe, but made WAY too much. It was very flavorful. I would make it again, but would cut the cabbage in half. If you plan on making this for a really big crowd then leave it how it is.

I made a "minimized" version of this - without carrots or peas, since I didn't have them on hand. I do think the recipe omits putting the chicken back in the salad once it's been blanched and the broth is made. Why else would it be "Chicken and Cabbage" salad? Anyway, I liked the taste quite a bit - refreshing and filling salad. I cut the breasts into thin strips and put those back in. It was easy, quick, and tasty

Great salad, beats the ho-hum slaw variety anyday. Used extra jalapeno and husband loved it. Oh, and quite filling.

Great dressing. I substituted sliced bok choy for all of the cabbage and didn't use the sugar substitute...didn't miss it.

I, too, was, at first, surprised that you cooked the chicken and the peas, but then just left them out. Must be a new style of cooking. (I did shred the chicken and put both them and the peas in the salad.) Anyway, my wife and I both liked this recipe, although it had too much red cabbage in it for my wife. And there is not enough dressing for what the amount of salad. I left the dressing on the side and we used almost all of it in four small servings. But then, we like spicy food. I doubled the amount of jalepeno. Definitely a keeper!

I've been making variations on this for years and we love it! great with Thai chili paste. You can add baby shrimp, tofu, noodles, sprouts, chopped peanuts, etc. I do it a little different everytime and always a hit.

Fantastic summer salad. On a hot night, it's the perfect quick patio meal. I added some julienne sliced Green Peppers, and rice noodles on top. A couple glasses of wine and we were good to go. The dressing had just enough kick to it. Definitely will make again.

So-so, not too good with the vegetarian gluten chicken -- altho I can see the appeal for others. My husband gobbled it up. The resulting salad is immense.

Just didn't like this one at all.

I thought the recipe was pretty good, but I did change a few things. I left out the mushrooms, thought they were inappropriate in the salad mix. I didn't have any chicken broth, so I subsituted 1/4 cup of canola oil, to make the dressing. I marinated the chicken breasts in a little of the dressing (for about 30 mins.), and cooked them in a cast-iron grill pan. I also didn't have any sugar-substitute, so I just used a heaping teaspoon of white sugar. Reduced the amount of ginger to about 1 Tbs. The salad was very colorful in presentation. Don't make it too far in advance, as the red cabbage tends to "bleed".

This recipe is pure perfection! The only revision that I made, was to add some toasted almonds.

This dish was quick, easy, and delicious. It was the perfect blend of healthy ingredients. I found that the chicken isn't always necessary to make this a good dish if you're short on time. I recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing and healthy meal.

I found this recipe just ok. I replaced the large amts of mushrooms with 1 cup chopped or sliced water chestnuts. There is something about this recipe that needs help. I'm used to time consuming recipes but just didn't seem it was worth it. My husband liked the recipe, but said he doesnt like salads that don't stay on a fork. I served with pita triangles to help scoop.

I added red peppers as suggested by one reviewer. The outcome -- a very colorful dish with the fresh scent of ginger and coriander. The recipe makes a ton, but I found that sitting overnight did the salad no harm. Sure the cabbage wasn't as crisp (though I prefer it not quite so chewy), but the flavors really had time to blend. By the way, a cuisinart is the way to go with all the slicing in this recipe.

I only used half of the vegi mixture but the entire amount of chicken, snow peas and dressing. It was awesome! This is going into the "staple" recipe file.

Rating: 4
While the preparation time was a little long(all the chopping of veges and dressing ingredients)it was worth it in flavor. The dressing could be prepared the night before serving, but once the dressing and salad is mixed, it wilts. So 6 hours may be too long to let it sit.

This was somewhat time-consuming to make, but WOW! it's so flavorful and pretty! I think next time I would use rotisserie or leftover chicken and make the dressing the day ahead since this dish requires a fair amount of chopping. I'm thinking some kind of nut (almonds?) might be a good addition to this. It makes a lot. Would be good for a picnic or potluck. Unlike another reviewer, I wouldn't make this too far ahead as it loses some of its crunch and visual appeal. Also, next time I think I'll substitute something for the mushrooms (maybe red pepper strips).

What a delicious, low fat salad. It is better leftover the next day so use the 6 hours as a guideline. The recipe misses dicing the cooked, cool chicken and adding both the snow peas and the chicken with all the other ingredients. I had to use a full can of broth; make sure to cover chicken or it will reduce too quickly. I used 1 tbs. of bottled ginger which I love. A fair amount of prep time but it is worth it. Wonderful flavor....we loved it.

Does one cut up the chicken and snow peas I have purchased everything to cook this but after re reading the recipe I am stomped.

Was great-feeds a small army, though. Used half as much ginger. Got raves from co-workers
