This was a wonderful bread. I've never worked with semolina before this and was struck by the lovely crumb. It was perfectly even. I've fallen in love with the texture. These loaves were quite large, and absolutely lovely in appearance and fragrance: the olive oil gave them a golden hue, flecks of rosemary speckled the bread, and the loaves were positively redolent of lemon. Their fragrance was most heady! I'm looking forward to making these again. They are quite the showpiece!
