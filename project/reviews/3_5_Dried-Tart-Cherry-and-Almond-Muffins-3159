I followed the recipe and the muffins came out fine. But I wouldn't make them again without some changes. The consistency of the muffins is like almond paste, not a muffin. Also, there is no cherry taste--it's a waste of dried cherries. No orange taste, either. If I make them again, I'll use half the almond paste, possibly add almond extract, and add more ingredients to make them more like a muffin. Not sure what I'll do about the cherries. May try dried cranberries.

I loved this recipe. While making I did not have any oranges, juice or dried cherries, so I improvised with grand marnier and frozen cherries. This was not as tart I would have wanted, but still fabulous.

I had fresh cherries to use, so I made a few amendments that resulted in a perfect muffin. First, instead of the dried cherries and OJ, I substituted 1 c. fresh, pitted & sliced cherries. In place of the lemon peel, I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. I mixed the cinnamon into the flour mixture. For the baking, I used silicone muffin cups w/o butter and the batter filled 12 muffin cups. They baked for 22 minutes and were only slightly moist when checked with a chopstick. Everyone loves them, kids and adults. The almond flavor and the moist fresh cherries are wonderful together.

the muffin was indeed moist. however, there was little or no cherry flavor, despite increasing the amount to 1 cup. i had no problem with them sinking to the bottom as another cook mentioned. the almond flavor was overpowering. perhaps cutting the almond paste by 1/2 may help. i didn't personally like this muffin very much. i brought them to work. i'll let you know if anyone ate them.

My all-time favorite muffin recipe. The cherry-almond flavor is delicious. Easy to make recipe, moist muffin. Yum!

I found these to be too sweet. I used canned cherries instead of dried and omitted the orange juice. Perhaps the lack of tartness to balance all the sugar in the paste is the problem.

I followed this recipe to the letter and found the results were fair at best. The ingredients are relatively expensive, and the muffins were heavy and lacked flavor. It sounded great, but I would not bother to make these again.

Delicious! I made a few changes...sift the dry ingredients, except for the sugar. Add that before the eggs. I used dried sweetened cranberries, which turned out well. Also, I sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking, and when they had about 5 minutes left I added sliced almonds.

I made this recipe with 2 tbls. almond extract instead of the paste (just because I didn't have the paste). Also used one fresh orange for the juice and added the pulp to the juice...very good!Great for breakfast or a snack.

I made these without the cherries (simply because I didn't have any but did have almond paste!) and they are delicious. Not too sweet, subtle almond taste, moist, perfect hot from the oven. Next time, I'll try them with cherries because it sounds like a fabulous combination.

I baked these in a puffy muffin crown pan, sprinkling coarse sugar and sliced almonds on top. Wonderful!

My Sunday brunch was a huge success!!! The flavors are bursting from the cherry almond muffins along with the scramble eggs sausage and thyme. Wouldn't change a thing.

My family raved about these muffins. I used dried bing cherries- I couldn't find tart cherries. They sank to the bottom - did anyone else experience this?

Absolutely yummy and so simple. Use one cup of cherries rather than just half. Wait at least a day before eating, preferably two - IF you can. Perhaps an impossibillty!

I took the suggestion of the cook from Mill Valley, CA and made their version of almond paste - thanks for the recipe! I also substituted dried cherries with about two cups of frozen mixed berries, omitted the orange juice and added almond slivers on top. The result was delicious :-)!

Wonderful recipe with great flavor and nice moist texture. I used dried sweet cranberries (couldn't find cherries) and it was a nice mix with the almond and orange. I don't think I would change a thing but would add the sugar and slivered almonds on top as suggested by another reviewer for a pretty presentation.

Very moist and delicious! I tried it again as a loaf, using Oregon tart cherries from a can instead of dried and left out the OJ. Also made my own almond paste (1 C. ground almonds, 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1 egg), which seemed to make it a bit moister (and cheaper than buying almond paste!).

This is the best muffin I have ever had.

I thought these sounded wonderful as I love almond. But, they were not as good as expected, especially the 2nd day. They became very dry. Maybe I did something wrong?

The muffins were great, but next time I would omit the orange peel, as the orange flavor overpowered the almond for me. I topped the muffins with cinnamon sugar and slivered almonds before I baked them and they turned out very pretty!

The dried cherries and almond paste give this muffin a very pleasant flavor. The muffins were a little on the dry side, but otherwise were quite tasty.

Very good. I didnt have almond paste, so blanched almonds then ground them into a paste in the food processor. Added a touch of vanilla & a few more cherries as well. Next time I"ll add toasted almonds to the batter. Yummy

A great recipe. I have substituted dried cranberries for the cherries and have added slivered almonds to the batter.

Easy to make & VERY easy to eat ! Recipe turns out perfectly as written, although I agree with a previous reviewer that a few more cherries might be nice next time. Both orange & almond flavours come through strongly. Cooking time was dead-on for me. A definite make-again. Bravo !

These are really delicious and were quicker to make than I thought that they would be. They are perfectly sweet and taste great warm with lots of melted butter!

If you like dried cherries, you will love these muffins. The almond paste keeps them moist and is a wonderful combination w/the cherries. I served these muffins at a school holiday breakfast, and they were a big hit. A suggestion about the almond paste before you start making the muffins -- take it out of the foil wrapper, cut it lengthwise a few times and let it "air dry" a little while. This makes it easier to crumble, which, in turn, enables you to blend it w/the butter much better. Also, I added more cherries to my second batch -- probably about a cup. I think they are better w/more cherries. I also made them a day in advance. They are great warm or just at room temp. It's not necessary to reheat.

The almond taste is wonderful in these. I served these along with a simple salad with a walnut vinagrette. Very nice contrast in flavors. My daughter ate 2 fresh from the oven. We sealed them airtight for 2 days prior to my dinner party and the flavors improved wonderfully.

Have made these muffins over and over again since the recipe was first published. They are absolutely delicious.
