the cook from allentown pa is spot on - i set my broiler to 500deg, set my chestnuts on the second closest rack and set the timer for 15 minutes. perfect chestnuts! i shelled 2lbs in 40 minutes. be careful to work in small batches, because as soon as the chestnuts cool, there won't be any more steam to get the skins off.

THAT COOK FROM ALLENTOWN, PA IS A GENIUS!!! my broiler is set to 550 degrees, so 10-15 min per side was too long. i experimented, and with the nuts on the second-nearest level of the oven, i got perfect roast chestnuts at 5mins/side. my family thanks you!!!!

Roasted chestnuts are great but not this way....I've been making chestnut stuffing for 40 years and clean 4 or 5 lbs. of chestnuts each year and have always dreaded the chore. ALLENTOWN PA COOK YOU ARE MY HERO. It's the only way to go, cut off round end and broil 5 minutes a side. I did 5lbs in less than an hour, AMAZING!!! Thanks

roasted chestnuts are just delicious, but I agree that this recipe was WAY too time consuming - especially since after all that prep, I still had only one ingredient ready for the stuffing! Will try the easier method suggested below next time.

Good but too much work for an evening treat.I'm with the cook from PA who cuts off the top and broils them. Much easier although 5 min on a side seems to be enough. I'm going to try them on the grill! "Chestnuts roasting on an open fire" right?

I must admit that the chestnuts were excellent, but the process is too time consumming (over 2 hours for one pound!!!) so next time I need chestnuts, I'll use some out of a jar...

I would make this again, but with a sharper knife (does chestnut knife just mean it's sharper?) and the recommended protective gloves.

I didn't actually make this recipe but I give roasted chestnuts 4 forks because they're delicious. My method is easier; I cut off the light brown oval on top of the chestnut, put them on a cookie sheet, and broil them for 10 to 15 minutes on each side, until they're slightly blackened. Then, I peel them promptly, using a potholder until they're cool enough to handle with bare hands. I think this is the easiest way to make roasted chestnuts.
