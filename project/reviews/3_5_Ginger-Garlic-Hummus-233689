Excellent! It has a lot of ingredients but well worth the effort. I used tahini instead of the cashew butter and added about 2tsp of lemon juice. I had barbecued garlic because I had it on hand. Got rave reviews.

Awesome recipe! Very easy to make. Loved the cashew butter in it. I added way more chili garlic sauce and when I put hummus in bowl, I made a well in middle & added a tablespoon or so of the chili garlic sauce....my co-workers loved, loved, loved it!!! I will make this again & again & again!

I used this as an appetizer for a party of 30 up in Vermont. Because it is Vermont, you'd best have some kind hummus to go with your copy of Manufacturing Conset. This recipe rocks. I also suggest using the jicama. It is a refreshing, crisp treat in comparison to the usual broccoli and cauliflower. If you do not have cashew butter (I did), it is an easy substitution: blend roasted, salted cashews with a drizzle of canola oil until the proper consistency is reached.

Very good. Extra garlic and chili-garlic sauce to taste will help. Added 1/8 cup sesame oil in addition to thin out hummus. Fresh ground the star anise and thought it really made this into something different. Will make again.

Excellent dish! I doubled the garbanzo bean liquid for a smoother consistency. I also needed to add some sea salt and a touch of tabasco.

Loved this dip! I didn't have cashew butter so used peanut butter instead. Could not find star anise to add, but it tastes really great without it. Dipped veggies and sesame rice crackers. Was a great "thai" variation on hummus and was a perfect appetizer for our sushi meal.

Sorry, I just can't get into this one, and I absolutely love hummus. I liked the idea of an asian twist on the regular hummus, but I didn't like the taste. Will stick to other "twists" like sun-dried tomato, roasted red pepper, kalamata olives, etc, etc. when I feel a need to do something other than the original hummus. Too bad to have wasted a batch on this one.

Enjoyed the Asian twist on a classic. Ground regular anise seeds, used tahini (realized too late that I could have processed raw cashews - next time). Lemon juice a must. Suggested vegetables make for a beautiful presentation.

very easy, and delicious varation on the "straight" recipe.

Wow. We thought this was fantastic. I substituted tahini because it was on-hand and didn't put in the star anise, because it wasn't-- but otherwise followed to a t. It was great. An excellent variation on normal hummus with a great kick from the ginger.

Too much ginger, it was overpowering. IF I make it again, and I am as yet undecided, I would cut that in half at least. I don't see it as a real improvement over a traditional recipe.

Could not find (in N.C.) star anise or the cashew butter & forgot to buy the chili garlic sce. It is still excellent with tahini, some chili powder and fresh garlic!

I've made this twice and really enjoyed it both times. Eveyone who had it loved it.

Use tahini in place of the cashew butter, the flavor will be much richer and more traditional (btw - tahini is a paste made from crushed sesame seeds and can be found in asian stores and/or middle eastern stores).

A fantastic variation on hummus. I freshly ground the star anise. It's a surprising addition. A definite keeper.

This was perfect. Served with a good bottle of Champagne for New Year's when people first arrived. Everyone raved.
