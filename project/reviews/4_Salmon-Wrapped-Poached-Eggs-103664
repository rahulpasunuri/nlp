This is a tasty meal either for breakfast or lunch. I had guacamole leftover that I used instead of plain avocado.

This is definitely a keeper recipe! The only change I would make is to poach the eggs using the saran wrap method (saran wrap sprayed with cooking spray draped over a ramekin, crack the egg into the saran wrap,pull up saran wrap to make a baggie for the egg and fasten with a tie, and then put into the water for 3 to 4 minutes to cook).

This is the easiest most elegant brunch recipe I have found or eaten. My guests have always been bowled over by it. I have used multigrain bread instead of brioche which was fine. It is a texture I prefer.

I thought this was good and it certainly made a beautiful presentation. I liked it because I thought it was very light for a brunch dish. It's a nice thing to make when you don't want to make something too filling.

Yummy! You can shave calories by serving this on a bed of wilted spinach and argula rather than the brioche. And it's lovely at Passover with a basket of matzo on the side.

This recipe is awesome!!! I used whole wheat english muffins and substituted low fat greek yogurt for the sour cream. The sauce was amazing and I will use it from now on in all recipes that call for hollandaise. HUGE hit!

We loved this wonderful brunch dish. I used roasted salmon instead of smoked, and layered the eggs first then topped with salmon and sauce. Definitely will make this again for just us, and for guests as well.

Loved this, but like another reviewer, I think there are errors in the recipe. This is a great basic recipe that's easy and fun to play around with.

I loved the flavour of tarragon in the sauce. So much easier than making Hollondaise on a weekend morning.

Yum! To save on fat a teensy bit (also so I didn't have to make a special trip to the bakery), I used English muffins instead of brioche. I also just put the eggs on top of the salmon instead of wrapping them. This was a decadent, delicious brunch treat! Try adding cucumber or tomato slices too.

Fantastic for brunch! We made them on a toasted english muffin, instead of brioches, and used light sour cream. Will def. make them again soon.

Just a note on the previous reviewer. 6 Brioche is right because when you cut them into 3 slices each, you get 18 slices, which is 2 more than 2 each. I guess you get to munch on those while you poach the eggs!

We loved this recipe, a variation on eggs benedict but less rich. However, I think there are some errors in the recipe. It calls for 6 individual brioches, but the recipe serves 8 people.I used slices of challah bread instead because I couldn't get brioches in my small town. I thought using a tomato slice instead of avocado whould cut down on the richness and provide a contrasting texture. The directions also say to preheat the oven to 350 degrees. What for? Do use the sorrel or arugula as this provides a nice contrast to the smooth eggs and salmon. I don't think it takes a whole hour to prepare. This makes a wonderful celebration brunch dish.
