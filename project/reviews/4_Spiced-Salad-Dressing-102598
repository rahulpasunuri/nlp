If you're buying salad dressings from the store you're mad. This is the simplest, fastest dressing I've ever tried.

Too picy...overpowered the fresh greens. Reduce the chilli sauce!?

re: "it's a pie in the photo" - the pic actually doesn't refer to this recipe at all - it's the personal signature of the reviewer.

I made this to go with a Mexican celebration. I halved the recipe and had plenty leftover. Used whole small garlic, scallions and catsup..1 pablano pepper as that is what I had on hand. Very quick in the blender

Instead of the green pepper I used about 1 cup of mild banana peppers. I also took out the tomato sause adnd added 1 extra clove of garlic. We loved it!

Very good dressing. I made 1/2 the recipe and served it over spinach leaves topped with broccoli slaw and broccoli florets. Delicious. The kids loved it to. Oh..yes, I did substitute tomato paste instead of tomato sauce which I didn't have. I always have little frozen cubes of tomato paste in the freezer.

I usually make my own salad dressing and sometimes need new ideas! This dressing was convenient because I had all of the ingredients. I used a red bell pepper and it gave it a nice sweetness and color. I only used 1/2 cup oil and it was very fresh tasting, not heavy. Definitely going in the recipe book.

Reduced the oil by 1/2 and replaced the onion with shallots. Served over a mix of ripe cherry tomatoes split in half, english cucumber and green pepper. It was very reminiscent of gazpacho, nice bright flavors.

The best salad dressing I've ever made as I have not had much luck with dressings in the past. And it was so easy.... with ingredients that I always have on hand. I like the way it blended together and did not need extra mixing after blending. If you like hot and spicy food, you'll love it. And my guests liked it too. I added fresh rosemary just for fun.

This was just right. I had it on a salad of romaine and arugula with walnuts and parm reggiano. It went really well with those ingredients. I can't think of anything I would change about the recipe. Great to have an alternative to my standard vinegar and oil mixes.

I've been making this for years and we call it Thousand Island. Yeah - it's a pie in the photo. They don't proof the website at all.

One of the best salad dressings I have ever had. It doesn't keep for long, so half the recipe (if you don't have company).

Oddly, the picture file associated with this recipe is of a pie.

YUMMY!!! Nice spicy dressing, perfect with greens and few veggies.

This recipe is mis-titled "Good Pie", whatever that means. This was good, but I had to add a tad bit more of the spices, we like it spicey. Great on just plain greens.
