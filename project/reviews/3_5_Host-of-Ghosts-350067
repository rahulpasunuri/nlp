I made a red velvet cake and then the ghostly frosting - a "bloody ghost cake" for a Halloween party. It was a huge hit!!!

For jen_neh from vancouver: you are actually pasteurizing the egg whites while beating them on a double boiler, so no worries for your pregnant friend!

I haven't made this yet, but could anyone tell me how long in advance you can make the frosting & frost the cake?

This is a total copy off of a Martha Stewart cake. Try hers. http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/chocolate-marshmallow-ghost-cake-and-mini-cupcakes

My friend and I made this cake and took it to work. It was such a success, everybody just loved it. The frosting is so yummy. The ghosts came out so cute. If you can, try to get the sugar candy eyes, they make the ghost look great. I went ahead and made my own cake. The frosting is so silky and delicious. Will make it again.

I agree with PP and make your own cake; I made one out of the box, and it was really great. Icing is Fab! Question: Could I use pasteurized egg white powder instead of egg whites? I'll have some pregnant friends my event and they can't have raw egg.

Very cute and easy. Yes, I used a homemade cake, but it is the idea that is being rated here, not a cake recipe. Ignore the 1 fork rater who did not even make it, and wanted to know how long to bake a ready made store bought cake?

I really liked this concept, but gmfuller is right---next time I'll make the cake itself because that was the least good part of the whole recipe. I couldn't find googly eyes at the store either, so I used chocolate sprinkles, but chocolate chips are a much better idea for when I do it again in a few days for a party! Don't underestimate needing it to be room temperature--it can't be rushed.

I brought this cake to a masquerade party.The meringue frosting was amazing, and everyone complimented it. The ghosts were adorable. Instead of googly eyes, I used mini chocolate chips because I bought a chocolate angel food cake. Next time, I think I will just make a cake instead of buying one, because the cake was really disappointing, especially contrasted with this amazing frosting!

To Lindagrez - I think there aren't any baking times because you're supposed to use a prepurchased cake... and the icing recipe is provided using the link.

It doesn't get much easier. Will be making this for a Halloween potluck. To lindagrez, there's no baking time because you use a store-bought cake.
