We enjoyed this recipe, though we did alter it. I replaced the chervil with 3tbs of cilantro and celery with 1/2 a red pepper diced. Then added 2tbs pico de gallo, 2tbs minced garlic and guacamole mix. Also doubled the veg. stock, crab meat, and lime juice. Then mixed both.

This recipe as is is extremely thick (to the point where is could be used as a light dip). To thin it out double all of the liquids. The flavors will be very rich either way, taste buds beware. (Add more crab to taste)

So disappointing. The soup has no depth of flavor and was saved only by the crab, which was not even well complemented by the green mush. Waste of two perfectly good avocados.

Fresh, light and delivious. I disagree with the comments that it is too thick. Also, I used more stock and less water to enhance. It is a good recipe for two people for a big bowl. I added extra crab as it was more of a main for two people.

This soup was a terrific first course as part of a summer dinner party. The celery in the crab salad provided the perfect crunchy texture in contrast to the smooth, rich soup. The serving size turned out to be relatively small, and the texture of the soup was thicker than I'd expected -- so, I thinned it out a little by doubling the amount of stock, and it was still very creamy and dense.
