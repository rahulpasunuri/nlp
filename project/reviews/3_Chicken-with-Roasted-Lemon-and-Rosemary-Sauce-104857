I made this last night for my husband and he loved it. I used skinless chicken but placed a slice on pancetta over each chicken breast before putting the dish back in the oven to finish cooking. Pretty presentation and great flavor!

This recipe tasted as it sounded with the ingredients: fresh, healthy, spring-like; however, I can't believe the unnecessary steps taken to get a flavor I believe could have been made in half the work. If I made it again, I would lightly brown the chicken, par boil potatoes, trow into roast pan and top with lemon, rosemary, garlic. I bet I would have an almost identical dish without the constant do this now.

As some other reviewers said, the sauce was very lemony. I didn't taste as I was cooking because I am new to chicken (a 15 year vegetarian entering the foray of poultry). Had I tasted the sauce ahead of time I would have done something to correct for the overwhelming lemon flavor - either adding more butter or some honey. I did use skinless breasts because that's all my store had in the organic brand so perhaps there was less fat to cut the citrus. I will make this again but with changes to the sauce for sure.

this was easy & delicious! used 4 skinless boneless breasts, watched it closely in browning & roasting-exactly 5 minutes browning & 10min in the oven. used 1/2 tsp rosemary & 1 lemon. Used butter for sauce. excellent.

Wow! Fantastico! I made this for Mother's Day dinner with the inlaws and my parents - everyone raved about it! I was unconvinced it would be so tasty and almost chickened out before I made it (no pun intended). The sauce is oh-so-delicious and the chicken stays so moist. Mmmm. Will definitely keep this one in my repertoire! P.S. The instructions can seem intimidating and time-consuming but it's really not! I made it all with a bunch of people in the kitchen and didn't get flustered once.

seems like a lot of work but wasn't. I added potatoes, cut up, to bottom of pan, chicken on top & sauce poured all over. Very very good!

The instructions seem more complicated than they are. I suspect that the roasted lemon juice can be made ahead of time as well.

I have used lemon/rosemary/garlic in other chicken recipes and this one is fantastic!! I made the sauce exactly as the recipe, except I used no-salt chicken broth and added 1/2 white wine before reduction. I was short on time, so I cut the chicken up into serving pieces, and thickly sliced a couple of large baking potatoes. I layered the potatoes on the bottom of the pan, placed the chicken on top, and poured the sauce over. Baked at 400 degrees for 45 mins., or till done. I had 2 globe artichokes which I quartered, placed in a casserole pan and also poured some of the sauce in there along with the lemon skin. Covered and baked for 1 hour at 400. Those were outstanding as well. This will be a staple recipe for me. Broiling the lemon was no extra work if you pop it in first thing and gather your other ingredients while it's broiling.

It was quite lemony... and I love lemon.

I have just made this and it was very good. I do however think that using fresh items like lemon and rosemary and parsley to make a topping and then frying the potatoes and chicken are kind of counter productive. Next time I would prefer to bake the chicken and potatoes and pour the sauce over top.

Rating: 3
Wonderful recipe, but I only had small lemons on hand, so I used 3 instead of the 2 large lemons called for. Had I followed the recipe to its specifications, I believe this recipe would be perfectly balanced, but I found my sauce to be too 'lemony' even after the addition of butter. Nonetheless, the chicken came out perfect & delicious... I just used less sauce. Oh, and I used some of the sauce on steamed green beans instead of potatoes--as I'm trying to cut back my carbs--and this turned out wonderfully too... although after all the rave reviews, I hope to make this dish w/potatoes next time. :)

My first impression: I was eating a rosemary three! To much rosemary in that recipe. And is not necessary to cook the chicken into the oven!to long for nothing.

I've now made this recipe three times and absolutely adore it. The flavor is not too heavy and perfectly complements the chicken and the potatoes...oh, the potatoes. They really make this dish. This is going in my book of favorite recipes.

GREAT flavors! I love the process of cooking, but if you're busy, just kosher a whole chicken and roast it with the potatoes and sauce. Add a touch of dijon mustard to the sauce for added richness. The potatoes are still to die for, and I spent time with family for an hour and a half while the chicken roasted.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. The potatoes are fabulous, and although some reviewers feel that it's fussy, it has enough periodic downtime during active cooking (while roasting lemons, boiling potatoes, and baking the whole dish in the oven) that it is easy to balance all your dishes, and you have plenty of time to get some other side dishes ready. While the sauce does not coat the chicken as a thicker sauce would, the overall flavor is light and refreshing - doesn't leave you feeling heavy after the meal. This will be come a staple.

Rating: 3
great flavors. I think it would be better with Meyer lemons or add a touch of sugar. I simplified several of the steps (sauteed chicken with salt pepper, rosemary and garlic) until done (eliminating going back in the oven later...). I did slice the lemons into four slices before broiling and then deglazed the pyrex with a little wine to get up the browned juice. YUM!

The chicken was pretty good, nothing extraordinary, but the potatoes. Ohhhh, those potatoes. They were so amazing. The sauce is good, especially if you think of it more as a lemon vinaigrette then a gravyish sauce. This was a great meal, and we roasted some asparagus spears to go along with it. Not too hard to make, but pretty great.

Agreed with previous reviewer. This was a straightforward preparation -- if you have a culinary background. I liked it, but added a 1/4 t of sugar to cut the sour character.

I don't understand those people who gave a negative comment to this recipe. It's simple and delicious, seal the chicken, cook the potatoes, into the oven, and make the sauce.

I've made this twice, and it turned out really wonderfully both times: as delicious as it was beautiful, and neither bland nor bitter. I can see why some people found it fussy to prepare, but I had a lot of fun with it; I think this is just a recipe for people who enjoy the process of cooking. I did two things to the lemons that may have helped prevent bitterness: I picked out as many seeds as I could before roasting them, and when making the pan sauce I gave the lemon juice +/- 30 seconds to cook before adding the stock (because the recipe says that the heat will cook off the bitterness.) I like the idea (which somebody recommended down below) of slicing the chicken before pouring on the sauce, although it's good even if you serve the chicken pieces whole.

my sister gave me some meyers lemons so I made this. my husband and i really liked it. I probably used more rosemary and garlic than was called for and I used 3 lemons but they were small. My potatoes were small and didn't take as long to boil - maybe 12 minutes and i left the chicken in the oven for about 18 minutes - the breast halves were big. the sauce was thin but we liked it like that. I will use thighs next time - we both like them better than breasts - and there will be a next time. very good. the potatoes are wonderful!!

Rating: 3
I've made this three times and each time I try to simplify the recipe - it is fussy but it's also delicious! I usually fry the potatoes with some garlic and rosemary and sprinkle some of the lemon juice over the potatoes and chicken before I put it in the oven. I make the sauce while they are cooking (cream is a good additiona and cuts the lemon flavor, which is too much) and then pour over it all when it comes out. It is worthwhile to read the previous reviews for tips but don't let them put you off...

#1. Keep this dish simple. #2. Lemon sauce is waaaay too tart, you must adjust it with.... 1/8 teaspoon sugar and 1 can of milk, or 3/4 cup of half and half. However, then it's an excellent dish. I would however, double the sauce. PS: I used Myer Lemons which are known to be one of the sweetest lemons, still, needed to adjust the sauce with cream, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 1/8 teaspoon of sugar. I seared chicken as instructed, but for a longer period of time. I used the same pan, to brown the potatoes, which I sprinkled with fresh rosemary. I then took a roasting pan (the same one I used to roast the lemons), I put the chicken breats in the middle and the browned potatoes around the chicken. I placed the roasting pan in the oven while I prepared the sauce. I used the same pan, that I'd seared the chicken and roasted the potatoes in to prepare the sauce. Therefore I had bits of potatoes in there, with which to thicken the sauce. For the sauce...I deglazed the pan with about 1 cup of red wine, I then added the roasted lemon, and reduced to about 1/2 of it's original volume. I then added more fresh rosemary, the roasted lemon juice, some sugar and 1 cup of canned milk (or use 1/2 and 1/2). Seasoned with salt and pepper, then poured into the roasting pan over the chicken and potatoes. Chicken was falling off the bone (I did not de-bone the chicken breasts) and the potatoes were crispy on the outside. Hubby and company really liked it. I would serve with sauteed spinach, and or asparagus, and or corn, for color. Bottom line, it's not that hard, and you only use 2 pans. One a large saute pan, and 1 roasting pan.

If you are a regular cook who knows that results come with effort, this is good. The lemon sauce does not become tart, in fact an extra squeeze of fresh lemon at the end gives a wonderfull, fresh flavor. For those that prefer sauces that are not real thin, add a couple TBLS of mashed potato flakes and simmer. And no, I don't use boxed mashed potato flakes for mashed potatoes!

Rating: 4
If you find the sauce too thin, brown the chicken much longer than suggested before baking. Mine were almost cooked through and golden brown so 10 minites in the oven was all that was needed and the sauce was thicker, due to more chicken bits stuck on the pan.

Rating: 3
The flavor combination in this recipe is classic. Other reviewers are right that there seemed to be many steps in its preparation - but it did turn out very well; it looked and smelled good and we all loved it. I recommend using the skin-on chicken that the recipe calls for - I didn't and the chicken was a little dry but I guess that's my own fault for not following directions...otherwise the recipe was great.

Rating: 3
Very good! I heeded the advice of previous reviewers and thickened the sauce with breadcrumbs (panko) and poured the sauce over the chicken halfway through the roasting process. I found 10 minutes wasn't enough to cook the chicken - it took 25 minutes... But very succulent.

Rating: 2
This is tasty but the recipe is too fiddly. I will try it with several shortcuts next time. I am not convinced that roasting lemons is worth the extra step. The sauce is indeed thin and very very lemony...I agree with the previous reviews that suggest less lemon and more thickening.

Rating: 3
This is a recipe that needs to be worked on. I've made it once and it was passable, no more than that. But I now know the corrections I have to make. For instance, cutting down on the lemon, adding some rosemary to the potatoes while baking them and using some more butter for the sauce (it's certainly not optional). I was also thinking of making some herb butter to go with the potatoes the next time. Anyway, a very interesting recipe.

Just great! We eat at Tra Vigne frequently and I had ordered this dish the first time we were there. When the cookbook came out, I was thrilled to make it myself and it tastes very similar. Instead of chicken breast, I use whole legs which is jucier. Make it once and adjust the tartness to your liking the second time. I add more garlic than what is suggested and everyone loves it! As for the potatoes, make sure they face up so the edges get nicely browned! I get asked for this recipe every time I make it for guests. This is definitely in my permanent recipe file!

I made this dish twice, both times changing it a little. The recipe as given is confusing and too lemony. Also the sauce is too thin. I browned the chicken breasts, then browned the potatoes as instructed. (The potatoes are delicious!)The first time, I then made the sauce, thickening it with bread crumbs. I also added rosemary and white wine to the sauce. When I browned the potatoes, I sprinkled rosemary in them, too. The second time, I couldn't serve it right away, so I put the chicken and potatoes in a pan and poured the sauce over it and put it in the oven. I also used bread crumbs to thicken it, but not as much as the first time. It made a delicious brown sauce that everyone loved. I am still experimenting with this dish. I love the taste with rosemary and white wine. I'm simplifying it a little more each time.

I agree that this recipe is labor intensive, but it was very good and received rave reviews from my family! I recommend using skinless chicken breasts--the chicken absorbs more of the lemon sauce.

Absolutely delicious! I could not find boneless chicken breasts with skin on so purchased regular chicken breasts at the grocery store and asked the butcher to debone them for me. It saved lots of time!

The flavors were delicious. It ended up taking a lot longer than I expected. The chicken did not cook all the way thru when cooking as described, so I ended up chopping it into smaller pieces and frying. Would definately make it again!

We have made this recipe several times for guests and they have all raved about it. Serve it with some roasted asparagus, salad, crusty french bread and pinot grigio for an elegant and tasty meal. It's a bit labor intensive, but the end result is well worth it.

Ehh... it was ok. In my opinion, the chicken needs to be marinated in the lemon. If you study the recipe, you'll see that the chicken only meets the lemon reduction when you plate it... so the flavor doesn't permeate. The potatoes were very good, but in my opinion this dish was too much work for the end result.

My husband loved this dish. I sliced each chicken breast into 5-6 slices and returned to the sauce before serving. This enabled us to have sauce on each piece.

Made this dish last night, and it was wonderful! I used 2 small lemons rather than 2 large, but next time I'll use 1 small. Little too much zing for me--and I like zing!

I will definately make this one again, but with a few changes. I agree with most others that one lemon would have been sufficent, and I added more garlic and rosemary. I also added a splash of red wine when deglazing the pan. Yummy!

The dish was fabulous.There are a lot of steps but some can be done ahead. The roasted lemons add a wonderful taste. I made spinach with garlic and balsamic vinegar and it was the right side dish.

The dish was fun to make. I used half breasts with bone in and I won't do that again because they took longer to cook and this dish really deserves a boneless breast. The potatoes turned out fantastic. This is a dish to savor with a nice bottle of Chardonnay.

Agree with the other raters that 2 lemons is too much and need to pump up the rosemary. I used chicken pieces with skin on and increased the cooking time in the oven until done. A cast iron skillet does the job for both broiling lemons and browning on stovetop and in oven. I didn't need cornstarch for sauce...just boiled hard on high heat until thickened.

My husband and I liked this dish very much. I used both lemons and enjoyed it. I did have to add some cornstarch to make the sauce thicker and I doubled up on the rosemary.

Average dish. My wife liked it better than I did. The potatoes were a three fork though. The sauce needed to be thickened slightly with a cornstarch slurry even after concentrating my homemade dark chicken stock. I only used one lemon (all I had) and it was just right, two lemons would have been too strong.

tHIS WAS A VERY TASTY DISH. I USED CORNSTARCH TO THICKEN THE SAUCE SOME.

The sauce was too thin, I thickened the sauce with corn starch. Simple to make- I used skinless, frozen chicken filets. These cooked fast and the recipe only took about 40min.

Way too lemony. If I were to make it again I would only use one lemon. Otherwise it lacks any pizaz, very ordinary. It needs a fancy vegetable dish to compliment it.

The final dish was delicious. My only frustration was that the directions were quite confusing. I found myself re-reading them over and over. I used regular concentration chicken stock and reduced it by half, but the sauce was still more watery than desired. The sauce was tart, but very tasty and it did not need the optional butter. Both my husband and kids really enjoyed the dish.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I made a couple of changes to the recipe. Instead of lemon I used lime and prepared the sauce in one pan. I condensed the sauce and poured it over the chicken and potatoes, then cooked in on 400 for an hour and fifteen minutes. The chicken came out tender and juicy, with the meat falling off of the bones. I used a whole chicken instead. This is a quick and easy recipe to prepare. I would make it again. It is light and healthy.

From start to finish this dish took less than an hour to prepare, and was fairly straight forward and easy to follow. The chicken was tasty, and the baby potatoes were soft and delicious. I would definetely make this again.

I'm teaching a small cooking class for local foodies, and we made this dish for our main course. First off, it is a lot of work, sauteeing the chicken, removing it from the pan, frying the potatoes, removing them from the pan, etc., so I think if I make it again I'll simplify the recipe. Also, the sauce was inexplicably bitter -- we could only guess that this was from the pith/skin of the roasted lemons, which extracted some bitterness when we juiced them. It was pretty unpleasant. Also, the sauce needed to be reduced considerably. I used a double-rich stock for the sauce, but it yielded a sacue with no body. I think that the recipe would be better with a true stock reduction or near demi-glace. I'm not going to give up on this recipe, but I am going to redo it for a home kitchen.

Rating: 2
I agree this was rather a lot of work for a weekday dinner. While my guests enjoyed it, I have to say the sauce with the roasted lemons is entirely too strong/lemony. I tried to tone it down by adding in some margarine as was suggested (I didn't have butter). I can't say it helped.

Rating: 3
While I was making this, it seemed like a pain. . .a lot of steps for not many ingredients. The end result was worth it though. DELICIOUS! The chicken was very moist (I used skinless breasts because that's what I had on hand) and the sauce was very tasty. I will make this again, though I would be more likely to make it on the weekend, not after a day at work. I suppose some of the steps (roasting the lemons, concentrating the broth) could be done ahead of time.
