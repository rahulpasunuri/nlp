This was a little too sweet. perhaps with less O.J. and some more heat(maybe jalepenos or something)...

I thought this would taste better than it did. I think it was a little too sweet for my taste, even though I put salt with the onions as they cooked and more salt in the finished dish. I had to substitue a Dole juice blend for fresh orange juice, if I make this again, I will use fresh. I did like using cumin seeds rather than ground cumin. I'm not sure if I would make this again, if I didn't love it, I probably won't.

The combination of mint, oj, & cumin make this an exceptional dish. It is amazingly easy to prepare & goes well with a variety of entrees. Make it once & you'll make it again!
