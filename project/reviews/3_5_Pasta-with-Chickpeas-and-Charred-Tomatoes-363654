This was easy and hearty. I added a few chopped up links of sweet Italian sausage to the tomatoes. Worked great.

I've made this tasty dish several times, with a few adjustments: added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for some brightness and zing; like many of the reviewers, I've cut the amount of pasta water mixed with hummus way back; and sometimes add a dash of cayenne for some heat.

Surprisingly tasty! The combination of ingredients seemed a little odd, but this recipe got good reviews so I decided to give it a whirl. The smell of the warm hummus was a little off-putting at first, but once I let the dish cool down a bit and put a spoonful in my mouth, I was glad I did. Make sure that you cook the tomatoes over very high heat at first if you want to char them sufficiently.

I've made this dish numerous times for my family and even my meat-starved husband requests it. I follow the recipe except that I substitute Sabra Supremely Spicy hummus for the plain as we love spicy food. The first few times I made this recipe, my tomatoes did not char and I ended up sticking them under the broiler. However, recently I have simply turned up the heat a little and now have no problems charring them. YUM!

Good weeknight meal. Have made this a few times. I put the hummus directly into the tomatoes and mix. The add pasta water as needed. Like other reviewers, my tomatoes don't char. I have made with both regular and smoked paprika- it's good either way. Sometimes sub parsley for cilantro depending on what I have on hand.

This is a delightful dish! The portion is enormous and all the bright flavors make it a hit for dinner. I will be making this again and again.

Made this recipe when my daughter had a vegetarian friend over. She loved it and asks for it every time she visits and we all liked it as a side dish. Easy to make and works great if you have to make substitutions.

this is such a delicious recipe! I also swap out penne for farfalle, and my five year old stepson calls it Balls and Butterflies. I think the smoked paprika is really key, and the hummus tastes almost like a cream sauce.

Served this at a dinner party and all my guests loved it and asked me for the recipe! I'm only giving it 3 forks, because I did need to make some changes to the recipe. I made the following changes: 1. I used a Farfalle pasta instead of Penne 2. I used less "pasta water" than the recipe called for to keep the pasta from being too watery. 3. I added 1 small yellow onion (diced), and 1 small shallot (diced) to the tomato/chickpea mixture to add veggies and sweetness 4. Regular paprika instead of smoked paprika (I would have used "smoked" if I had it, but I don't think the dish needed it in the end) 5. italian parsley instead of cilantro for garnish 6. used a roasted garlic hummus for extra flavor 7. I cooked the tomatoes in oil on HIGH temp to get them charred then turned heat down to low-medium to add the chickpeas, onions, shallots. Cooked all of it together for almost 20 minutes to soften the onions.

Delicious and e-a-s-y. The "sauce" of hummus, olive oil, cooking water, and spices creates a delicious mild and creamy base for the pasta (I used farfalle). Damn simple and so tasty!

As I was cooking, I thought I've never smelled anything so awesome. I was really thinking that! But then when it came to eating it...not so much. I didn't like the taste at all. O well. It was a good try.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was quick & easy to make and the ingredients are all things that we keep on hand. My only change was I used roasted red pepper hummus instead of plain and it was delicious! This will definitely be a recipe that we will use often.

I didn't drain or rinse the garbanzo beans and it added nicely to the sauce. Flavors were great and don't pass on the paprika.

So much flavor for such little work. The only change I made was using Roasted Garlic Hummus instead of plain, and using a little extra. Delicious.

Excellent for a dinner party, everyone really enjoyed it. I made homemade spaghetti instead of the penne and added a few chopped shallots to the tomatoes as modifications. The smoked paprika is key in my opinion. I couldn't get my tomatoes to char... I might try a quick broil at the end next time.

Really good and fast veggie entree. The plum tomatoes at my store didn't look great, so I substituted regular tomatoes. I skipped the olives since I'm not a fan. My DH was skeptical, but it was very good! Similar enough to typical spaghetti, but different enough to be interesting. Like another reviewer, I found that the amount of water was too much, and added the hummus straight to the tomato sauce (this probably depends on the amount of water in the tomatoes).

Unfortunately with all of the rave reviews, I was disappointed in this one. I like all of the ingredients but when they were combined together the flavors were not a hit for me. Perhaps combining chickpeas with pasta is poor choice.

I forgot the hummus and cilantro, but other than that it was really good. Next time it will be exceptional.

I love this recipe! I've made it twice already and both times it came out great. It's easy. Just remember to use a large pan! And I used really nice expensive noodles, I think it makes all the difference.

Very tasty and beautiful to look at - creamish background with bright green, red and black, with paprika over, look very fresh, healthy and appetizing, which it is! Also simple to make, and the ingredients are easy to come by and not very expensive.

I added broccoli and substituted out the olives for black olives. It was so quick.. and amazing.

This recipe exceeded my expectations! Excellent for a quick and easy meatless meal. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding toasted pine nuts for garnish at the end. Yum!

Very easy and very tasty. I was skeptical about the cilantro but it adds a nice counterpoint to the smokiness of the charred tomatoes and paprika. Next time I will cut back on the amount of liquid I mixed with the hummus...1/2 cup made it too watery for my taste, especially when combined with the tomato juices in the pan. Otherwise, delicious and I plan to make it again and again!

It was okay, but I would not make it again. The combination of flavors is just too strange.

Very tasty! Definitely a keeper for the recipe box. I don't think it will taste as good as a leftover or make-ahead recipe. But can't wait to make again and share with friends.

I will admit...when I first read this recipe, I thought it was a rather odd assortment of ingredients. Let me tell you, DELICIOUS! This will be a frequent staple in our home.

I made this using spicy hummus, and it was very good. I didn't use as many tomatoes as the recipe suggested, and it was just fine. I'm putting it in my Tastebook!

Huge return for very little effort. This is an incredibly tasty (and healthy!) meal. I couldn't quite get the tomatoes to char in the saute pan. Next time I'll grill them instead.

What a surprise! This was delicious. I chose this recipe because I happened to have all of the ingredients on hand and I was short on time. I didn't change anything. I used Safinter Smoked Spanish Paprika (from Whole Foods) which is a hot paprika. The 1 teaspoon called for gave just the right kick to it and I believe pulled it all together. DH, who sometimes complains about "too spicy," absolutely loved it. Great vegetarian entree.
