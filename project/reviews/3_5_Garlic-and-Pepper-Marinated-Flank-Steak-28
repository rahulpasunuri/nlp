I added balsamic and some spicy steak seasoning...very good! Extra garlic too!

I grill flank steak a lot, but only use s&p. This marinade caused my sweetheart to say, "Wow, what did you do?" We both loved it. I did add 1+ Tbsp of lime juice to the marinade, and a little squeeze when the steak came off the grill.

I added the juice of one lime and only marinated for 3 hours as others indicated and it was delicious! I made it for Mother's Day for three generations and everyone loved it. The combo of the freshly cracked pepper and the freshly squeezed lime juice is the key.

Wow- so simple and yet so delicious! I added lime juice as suggested and I feel that it made all the difference. I've used a similar marinade for years, but this one is even better (plus lime juice). My husband, mother-in-law and seven year old all loved it and finished every last bit. I used NY strip steaks and sliced them just as I would have for a flank steak. Will make again and again!

This is so easy and fast (after is has marinated). I'm making it for the third time tonight because my husband loves it so much. I added the scallions and limes once and the balsamic last time. Both great additions!

What a great mid-week dinner! So easy and tasty too. I put this in to marinade right after work, and it was tender and juicy by dinner time. Next time will use more garlic and maybe add a little balsamic vinegar to give more zing. Will be making this one regularly.

A winner with kids, Mom & Dad! We had no left overs the first time so we doubled the recipe the following week. Surprisingly delicious and very simple

Amazing! I took the others' advice and used low-sodium soy sauce, added lime juice and scallions. My mouth is still watering. Just amazing...can't say it enough!

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. Like others, I add lime juice to the marinade. I usually serve it with basmati rice and grilled vegetables tossed in basalmic vinegar and olive oil. It's a perfect summer meal.

Given the ease of preparation, the magic done to the flank steak and the raves from the boyfriend, t'is a four forker!

What a great and simple recipe. Everytime I make flank steak the recipes require some marinade concoction of 5 or so different liquids. I loved how simple this was and how great it tasted. And it wasn't sweet, which a lot of flank steak recipes tend to be. I think I have finally won my husband over to flank steak. I marinated the meat for 2 hours and broiled it for about 15 minutes.

Loved it loved it! It was so easy to make. I took the suggestion of adding lime juice and it was great. I marinated it for 2 hours and it was perfect and full of flavor. I also used seasoned pepper.

Simple yet delicious -- chopped a couple of shallots and added them to the marinade. Also used lime juice, as someone had suggested. Served the flank steak with potatoes dauphinoise and a tossed green salad.

This recipe was ok, but not great. Would have liked for it to have a little more...something. I'm not quite sure what it was missing, but I've had better.

I added some lime juice but just because I had it around. This was tasty and I will definitely make it again.

Great! You don't get easier than this and my guage of a good recipe is whether or not I get asked for it. I made this for a small dinner party with roasted asparagus and twice baked potato cups with shallots (from this site)and got rave reviews! My guests asked for the recipe...

Great! It was so quick and easy! I actually used venison (backstrap). I'm always looking for suitable recipes for it. The marinade had a wonderful flavor but a bit too salty, even for the venison. I'll use the low sodium soy sauce next time. It's a keeper!

My husband loved this recipe. Very easy and quick to make.

My family really liked this recipe for a Father's Day barbeque. The marinate was good and the dish was quick and easy to prepare. I followed earlier recommendations and used less soy and only marinated for 3 hours. Very nice!

This recipe is highly suitable for consumption... I'd add more garlic and cutting up scallions and throwing on top to marinate helps too.. but it is delicious

3 hours to marinade was plenty of time. I absolutely loved this recipe. Very easy and very yum! Great as a left over steak sandwich.

This receipe has joined the staples of repeated meals for my family and summer barbecue with friends. I used freshly ground pepper (not quite as much as called for) and doubled the marinade to accomodate two flank steaks and it was a foolproof winner. I did increase the olive oil slightly as well as the garlic. When considering children, I might not marinate it to the fullest extent (the 6 hours) My kids are thrilled with it at the 3 hour level. Turning it in the marinade every half hour or so is essential. I akso take the dish out of the refrigerator about 20 minutes before putting it on the grill. It will make your barbecue messy but as one other reader said, any leftovers for sandwiches make you forget that the grill needs good cleaning!

Excellent! I was very happy with this!! And the boyfriend loved it. He went on and on about it with every bite. It was soooo good! And the drippings were great over the potatoes. mmmm mmmm good!

This was very easy and delicious! I also added a little red wine and about 1/2 tsp of minced fresh ginger. Put it on the grill and served it with jasmine rice and sauteed mushrooms.

This is such a simple dish to prepare and delicious to boot. I served this with grilled tomatoes topped with parmesan cheese and fresh breadcrumbs. Superb.

This is GREAT! With leftovers (if there are any...) I make unbeliveable sandwiches. But do add red wine! It gives it a little kick.

Wonderful and SO EASY. Thanks to previous reviewers, I added the juice of one half of a lime. We marinated the flank steak over night and then sliced it and served it in a Mexican fiesta! WILL DEFINITELY KEEP THIS RECIPE! Thanks!!

This was by far one of the best steak recipes we have ever had. We added some lime juice to it as well for some added flavor- it was delicious! Very easy and you don't have to marinate it for as long as the recipe calls for-an hour will do fine. Delicious!!!

This was wonderful and very easy. We used a london broil for this recipe, added about a 1/4 cup wine (we were already drinking it at the time and figured, "hey! It's open..."). We also added some fresh rosemary. We only marinated for about 30 minutes before we pan-seared and then broiled.

I DID'T HAVE TIME EITHER TO PRESS THE GARLIC SO I USED GARLIC SALT. IT CAME OUT GREAT.

This was so easy to make and incredibly delicious. I didn't have whole peppercorns to crack so I used ground pepper, and it turned out fine. I also didn't want to go through pressing the garlic cloves (I was feeling extremely lazy) so I just crushed the cloves with the side of a knife. I didn't have a problem with the saltiness.

SALTY!! Will DEFINITELY use low salt soy and will keep time of marination down to low end (I only marinated for 3 hours as it was).Also, do NOT brush with marinade while cooking unless you have heated it thoroughly first.

My husband loved this recipe - who is a very difficult to please. The marinade was a wonderful flavor that strayed away from the familar sweet and tangy ones. (I didn't experience any salty flavor at all, but I suggest you use low sodium soy sauce.

A great marinade, however a little salty. Next time I will use less Soy Sauce and a little white wine.
