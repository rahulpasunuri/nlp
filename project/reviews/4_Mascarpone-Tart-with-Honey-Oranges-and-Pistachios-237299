I made this tart for a dinner with guests. Last minute substitution of pumpkin pie spice, and also accidentally bought blood oranges. It was divine. The flavors are uncommon and go so well together. Warm spices, creamy mascarpone, sweet honey, crisp citrus. Plus the colors make tantalizing to the eye before it even hits the palate. Thank you!

This tart is off the hook! Such complex flavors, and so delicious. Yet so quick and simple to make! I used a store-bought crust and clementines instead of oranges, and it was still delicious. My only issue is that it's extremely rich, caused a bit of stomach upset! ;)

This is my go-to quick company dessert. I might do my own crust one of these days for extra elegance. I think it's plenty sweet as is. The filling is so delicious--love to lick the bowl and the beaters. Blood orange suggestion is great. I'll definitely try that. The presentation is so elegant with the oranges and pistachios.

Wow! I could have eaten the mascarpone mixture straight out of the bowl. The flavors reminded me of desserts I've had at Indian and Afghan restaurants. While it's certainly convenient, refrigerated pie crust does not do justice to the rest of the tart.Next time I'll make a crust from scratch.

This recipe is super easy to prepare, delicious, and has a beautiful presentation. In other words, it's everything you want in a recipe! In terms of effort expended compared to result achieved, you can't do much better.

This was a great, easy tart. I needed a finger food, so I found a crust recipe and made mini tarts in a muffin pan and used this filling. It made about 24 mini tarts. I did add an extra dash of honey to sweeten it up per some other reviews, but then I thought it was too sweet. I would just use the amount in the recipe. The orange is a great contrast to the sweet filling. Here is the recipe for the crust I used: 3/4 c. butter at room temp, 1/2 c. sugar, and 2 c. all purpose flour. Cream the butter and sugar together and then stir in flour with a spoon. Spread into muffin tins (make 24) and bake for 10-15 minutes at 350 degrees.

Wonderful tart! I used a ready-to-use graham cracker pie crust, which was delicious and made the recipe even easier. I doubled the amount of honey, which didn't even make it too sweet. Could even use a bit more cardamom. I also recommend using blood oranges, since they really add to the presentation. Everyone thought it was delicious!

This super easy to make tart has not become a new family staple. I made it once and have been asked to make it again and again. It will be on our Thanksgiving table this year for sure. I have found that allowing it to chill in the freg. for a few hours makes the flavors more intense. For a sweeter tart, add more honey.

A delightful touch the cardamon adds to the mascarpone. I used a pate sucree crust in a tart pan. Beautiful presentation and super easy to make. Out of town guest as well as my HS daughter's friends loved it. I'm serving again to some HS girls next week.

This is a quick and easy dessert! I made a few changes: made the crust a graham cracker crust; heated the last 2T of honey in a saute pan and tossed the pistachios in it; used blood oranges for a prettier presentation. Do not use a deep dish pie crust (not enough filling) and make sure that you let it sit for a few hours before serving. The flavor gets more intense. Not a very sweet dessert but very light and perfect for spring. Made this for our supper club and everyone loved it~

I made this for my brother who has Type 1 diabetes. I substituted the small amount of sugar with Splenda and used my own buttery pie crust recipe. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it.

We loved this tart. My husband couldn't stop eating it. It is light and delicate. It is not overly sweet and it has a lovely orange flavor to it. It is not overbaring and a delightful dessert.

Worst tart ever!!! I've made many desserts from this site and be extremely pleased...this one really deserves 1/2 a fork just for the effort.
