Have not made it yet, but recipe seems incomplete. How do you make the sauce with just coconut flakes and mint? I suppose it if you divide that one papaya 1/2 for the salad and the other for sauce to be made in blender maybe? And one reviewer mentioned sugar, where is there sugar. Are we looking at the same Asian Fruit Salad with Papaya-mint sauce recipe???

I made this fruit salad for a BBQ at a friends house last night, and everyone absolutely loved it! I used mango in place of papaya as papaya were $3.50 each at my grocery store. I also added blueberries and kiwi. I didn't change the sauce, except the use of mango instead of papaya. It is definately a keeper and will be made many times at my house.

Loved this recipe--was a hit at a brunch. Used blueberries instead of lychees. Have given this recipe away three times since brunch! Just a little more interesting than your average fruit salad.

Really great recipe, very refreshing & absolutely delicious! Sugar in the sauce can be cut in half, I added mango to the salad & sauce to eliminate the need for so much papaya. Definitely recommend!

In Hawaii with friends, needed a papaya receipe, found this. Excellent, everyone raved how delicious. Didn't change a thing on the sauce, used only cantelope, pineapple, grapes and papaya. Next time will try with berries and not the grapes. Great salad.

To the cook from LA, the papaya-mint sauce recipe can be found by clicking on the link in the body of the recipe, or by using the epicurious search engine.....

I think this recipe is missing the information for the papaya-mint sauce. What did people use as the dressing/sauce?

I couldn't find the lychees so I substituted raspberries. YUMMY!!! I served it with Cold Honeydew & Mint Soup in Cantaloupe. The two were perfect on a hot summer day. I loved this recipe!

Very easy to make. I brought this to a dinner party and there wasn't a single piece left. Even the kids chose to eat this over ice cream...

This was a hit with my friends. I made a large bowl of it and there was hardly any left. I served it alongside Thai Chicken Pizza and it married wonderfully. A definite do-over especially when I am looking for a fruit salad that is a little different.

The whole is more than the sum of its parts--an amazing, light dessert that got great reviews from picky eaters and a lot of recipe requests. It helped to cement my reputation as a great entertainer!!!!!

This is a keeper!! I found a papaya that was large enough to use for the salad and the sauce. This is the most refreshing fruit salad I have ever tasted. I needed to go to an Asian market to purchase the lychees as our local supermarkets did not carry them.

We brought this dessert to friends who served Chinese food. It was a wonderful end to a delicious dinner. Everyone enjoyed it!!

My guests adored it (and this from people who don't like mint or papaya!)
