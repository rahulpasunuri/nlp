This recipe is a Thanksgiving holiday favorite that my sister would make in honor of my second daughter. It always seemed to be very involved, taking sometimes three days for the final product. One year my sister opened the fridge and it slid out on the floor, she began to cry and her sons and the guests scooped it up and we all ate it anyway! My sister passed away last year. I know we will continue to make it and will taste the love she always added to each pie.

This recipe is pretty simple. By hot brewing the coffee you use a lot less with no real change to the flavor. Even instant coffee works. Just make sure that your 1 1/4 cups of coffee is really strong. I have used Oreos, chocolate wafers, or Marcel Desauniers Double Chocolate Cookies for my crust. Really any chocolate cookie works. The same holds true for the nuts. Once I had no almonds on hand and used peanuts (dry roasted) instead. This is a simple but elegant dessert

This recipe is flawless and the dessert is perfect for a dinner party when you want something nice & light. Takes some advanced planning, but is actually quite simple to make. I would suggest a garnish of chocolate-covered coffee beans.

Delicious, pretty---and easy, too. First made in 1990 (from Gourmet) and still make it when I want a do-ahead dessert that seems to appeal to everybody--even kids.
