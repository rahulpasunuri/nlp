This sauce was so quick and easy - it took less than 5 minutes to prepare! After the sauce was totally reduced, off-heat I added the juice from the resting filets plus 1 tablespoon butter...delicious! I used this recipe for two filets, so definitely double the recipe for four.

I am always looking for a quick and easy filet recipe that doesn't require a grill and this was it. I don't like my filets super red, so after searing I put them in the oven at 450 for about 6 minutes. Also, I used ruby port and subbed part of the red wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar. Definitely double the glaze recipe. My husband loved it and he is not a big steak eater.

Love this. My husband, the filet expert, was stunned when I broke out the skillet, but his fears were gone once he tasted this wonderful recipe. I served with broiled asparagus and yorkshire pudding.

I have made this recipe for a crowd on Christmas Eve and it was a big hit with everyone. I roated the whole filet and made the glaze separately. Wonderful!

One yea, one nay in our house. But since the yea cooks, we'll have this again. The glaze amount seemed right to me.

THIS WAS LOVELY. I TOO USED BALSAMIC VINEGAR, WHICH WAS RICH AND VELVETY. I FOUND THE GLAXE AMMUNT SUFFICIENT, SERVED WITH POTATOES GRATIN AND STEAMED ASPARAGUS. VERY ELEGANT!

This was a really good recipe, especially when I added a couple of spices to my family's taste and increased the amount of dijon mustard. I will make it again, definitely!

Very good recipe, and very easy! Didn't knock my socks off, but could have been that the cut of filet was not as good as I expected. Definitely double the sauce as others recommended. I thought the sauce might overpower the meat but it didn't - was delicious.

Loved this and my friends always ask for the recipe when I make it. I changed it to use balsamic vinegar though and I think it imparts a more rich flavour.

Although this was simple to make I think there are much better filet recipes out there. Nothing wrong with it, but think you can do better for this cut of meat.

An excellent dish. The filet was delicious. Made with *Arugula and Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes and steamed green beans. The wife loved it! *Also found on this site.

Great dish. I used a beef tenderloin and poured the glaze on top of the slices. Everyone thought it was delicious. I made it with the horseradish mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas. Yum!! Easy and delicious~

Excellent taste. I also popped the steaks into a warm oven while the glaze reduced. They came out perfectly and the presentation was outstanding. Rave reviews for such an easy dish.

Great recipe. It takes quite a while to reduce the sauce so I would suggest putting the steaks in the oven on low while you do it. I served it with a mushroom risotto and it was fabulous!

Made this 6 months ago for 6 people and EVERYONE loved it(goes well with the horseradish mashed potatoes). I was so surprised on how great the filets turned out cooking them on the stovetop. I Am making it again soon this time for 12.

What an easy and delicious recipe!I will surely make this again and again!

FABULOUS! I made this dish on a large scale for a dinner party of 40. I cooked two loins of 5-ish pounds each, and poured the glaze on top after they were grilled to perfection. It was phenomenal, as I expected (based on the reviews). Needless to say, it's a great dish to make for a crowd because you can make it hours in advance. I multiplied the glaze recipe, and it took a VERY long time to reduce to a syrup-like consistency (nearly an hour for 3 cups port, 1 1/2 vinegar), but it was GREAT. People are mailing me cards asking for the recipe (no kidding). TRY IT!!!

This recipe is amazing. The port glaze compliments the filet mignons perfectly. As mentioned in other reviews I also doubled the glaze. Not only is this quick, but it is extremely easy. We have added it to our "serve for company" cook book. The glaze does take longer to reduce.

This was excellent. We were impressed at how good it was from so few ingredients. I doubled the glaze and could have had more to lick off the plate. I used Ruby Port as that is what I had. Just bought Tawney Port for next time. Anyone help with the difference and how important?

Made this for Valentine's Day. Was absolutely wonderful. I did use a raspberry red-wine vinegar and would not do so again. I also didn't reduce it enough. Next Time!!! Served it over Horseradish mashed potatoes and drizzled the glaze over it - delicious!! My family loved it!!

Very tasty and easy. I wanted to lick my plate clean of the sauce! I did use Ruby Port as I didn't have Tawny Port.

I make this frequently. For those of you who do not have access to a grill or a gas oven for proper broiling this makes for a very tasty dish. I am always lamenting the results I get when using electric grills or the broiling function of my electric oven (hot meat)But since pan searing can be done on electric this comes out great every time. I have never used port but have made it with red or white wine with a good balsamic.

An exquisite meal that just can't be much easier to prepare. Give the port/vinegar mixture all the time it needs to reduce down to the glaze. The only drawback is the clean up afterwards of the port reduction. Small price to pay for such a quick, easy, full tasting dish that'll be made again and again.

This dish was so quick & easy to prepare and DELICIOUS to top it off. I made it tonight as I had a red meat craving, and was utterly pleased. My husband raved and this recipe will remain in my collection. Try it - It's fabulous!

This recipe is fast & fabulous. It was easy to make, with a limited number of ingredients. I was able to cook a few filets for my young sons, and serve them without the sauce, while having a more mature dish for my husband and me. The cooking time of 4 minutes per side made perfect rare 1 1/2 inch filets. I did take the advice to let the sauce thicken a bit at room temperature, and I did coat the filets in the sauce before serving.

This was quick, easy and delicious. However, I found that cooking the meat 4 minutes on each side was too much for our tastes. We still enjoyed eating it, though, thanks to the yummy port and vinegar sauce and a cut of meat that stays tender even when done medium-well instead of rare.

Excellent!! Will make this over and over again. So easy and delicious!! Substituted Sherry for Port and it was still great. Served with Cous cous.

I added the meat back to the pan for a few minutes on each side to glaze them with the sauce and it was fabulous!! I served with garlic mashed potatoes and wilted spinach and a great pinot noir

This recipe was ok, not great. It was definitely not hard to make, but then the results weren't fabulous. To make it a little better I added a dollop of soft bleu cheese to each steak and poured the glaze over. The bleu cheese helped add flavor. Went well with a bottle of cab merlot!

This recipe is fabulous! I made it for a special romantic birthday dinner and it got rave reviews. The glaze is absolutely delicious! I served it with scalloped potatoes and steamed baby carrots, and of course, a full bodied red wine. I would highly recommend this recipe.

ABSOLUTELY great!!! and easy too (-:

This was OK, not bad, yes definitely quick and easy, but I wasn't as overly thrilled with it as some other reviewers. I used a ruby port instead of tawny since that's all I had. I guess I like my filets grilled more than pan fried. I'll try something else next time.

Talk about a great recipe! This is gourmet taste in a matter of minutes. We all enjoyed the sauce, the fragrance filled the kitchen and the family awaited something special. I definitely will make this again. This makes any cook look good.

This was so easy and so good. Next time I will add the filets back to the skillet for a couple of minutes to coat them better. I served it with gratin of yukon gold potatoes, bacon and arugula and steamed broccoli with lemon, garlic and soy.

This was the perfect Sunday evening dish. It was simple, elegant, and would please anyone. Very good- definitely recommend it. I made red garlic mashed potatoes on the side and a light spinach salad with almonds, cranberries and a red Cabernet vinigrette. You must make this!

This recipe was a hit. It is easy to make and full of flavor. I will be making some extra sauce next time.

I too found that 4 min per side was too short. I had to cook the meat about 8 min per side. Also, I found the glaze kind of thin and runny when I served it hot. But after dinner, when the leftover sauce came to room temperature, the glaze became very thick. I guess I should have waited a few minutes before serving the glaze so that it was less runny. Anyhow, husband loved it, and I loved it (and I'm not a big meat eater). This dish is very simple and delicious. A keeper

Oh, yes! This is definitely a keeper. It is such an impressive yet simple recipe. Double the sauce recipe, so you have a little to drizzle over garlic mashed potatoes on the side. The glaze is a beautiful burgundy color, and makes for a beautiful presentation in contrast to the white potatoes. Make this recipe! Now!

This recipe is definately a keeper. We love red meat, and it's always fun to look for a new sauce or marinade. I really liked the port addition to this sauce. It made it sorta plummy.

I don't eat too much red meat, but this was worth it....my husband loved the port wine glaze.

This recipe is very easy to make and produces great results. The menu works very well when using a fruity red wine such as a Beaujolais-Villages "vieilles vignes".

Excellent recipe! I had my doubts 1/2 way through making the sauce...I tasted it and the vinegar was soooo strong but the final sauce was great! I would definitely make this again.

This a rich, impressive and really easy recipe for a dinner party. It only takes you away from your guest for a few minutes, especially if you serve with roasted or make ahead side dishes.

One of my favorite recipes for company, and one that has gotten some of the best compliments. I find the 4 min. per side cooking instructions to be too optimistic. Depending on the thickness, I've needed as much as 8 min. per side. I also like using a lid on the saute pan.
