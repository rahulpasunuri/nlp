Delicious! I made this to serve with chai iced-coffee after an Indian-themed supper. It was an impressive,interesting and delicious end the meal. What a great combination of flavors! I spread the batter very thin as the reviews stressed, and the texture of the cookies was perfectly crispy. I will definitely make these again and again.

These are delicious. Spread the batter very thinly. The hot papper flakes are a must.

Yummy recipe that was fun to make due to the unusual last step of breaking the whole thing up. I trusted other cooks and spread the batter so thin it was almost see-through, and this strategy worked well...nothing burned that wasn't entirely covered with chocolate and nuts. I agree with other cooks who tasted no curry whatever. I added a quarter-teaspoonful and tasted no curry flavor at all. I also like a previous cook's suggestion of sprinkling cayenne flakes atop it all..I forgot to do so but will try it if I make these again.

I used a mixture of cayenne and chili powder my first go, as I had no Indian curry powder. Also, used dark chocolate and substituted toasted walnuts for pistachios. All in all, the crisps were bitter with a touch of sweet and the spice worked well. The cookies were a hit with all who tasted them.

Tasty and very quick. I used almost a half tsp of curry powder the second time I made this recipe which gave the already complex flavor more of a kick. For the first batch, I used a combo of dark and milk chocolate because that was all I had on hand & it worked out so well that I duplicated it the second time around. This is a really great pantry cookie, perfect for last minute gatherings.

I really liked these, super easy to make, they would be great to set out after a dinner party for a simple dessert. I think they'd taste good with almonds too. Definitely use extra chocolate chips.

I made these as one of many cookies for my Xmas party, and thought they were good, not great, at the time. But--they got rave reviews from several guests. They also keep really well--I just ate the last two pieces almost a month later and they were still crisp and yummy. I agree that you need to spread the batter very thin and cook long enough so that the cookies are crisp. I measured a 10x14 space on a silpat and made sure to cover the entire space--batter was very thin.

Eh. Not bad, but nothing to jump up and down about, despite how nice they sound. I sprinked some chili flakes on them, in addition to the curry, and am glad I did because otherwise I doubt I'd even bother putting then out. If you do make them, be sure to spread the batter very, very thinly. You should almost be able to see through it, otherwise you're going to end up with cookies, not crisps.

Easy. But meh.

To Mkmom: salted pistachios are not required (although it could be a nice twist). A trick to enhance any nuts' taste is to toast them and cool completely before using. The cookie should definitely be crunchy. I'd recommend spreading the dough a little thinner or baking a little longer. Good luck!

I was excited to try these as I was testing recipes for my upcoming cookie exchange party. Both my husband and I were a little disappointed with these. We thought they should have been more crisy (hence the name). They were more on the chewy side. The dark chocolate bits were tasty but we didn't taste the pistachios. I used roasted unsalted. Perhaps I should have used roasted salted ones??

Excellent! Didn't taste the curry at all, but no matter, still delicious and crunchy. My husband even stole these from my cookie gift tray.

Huge success! I was surprised because I expected them to be more praline-like than they were. My company thought they were wonderful and requested the recipe. I served them with the Tangarine Bavarian...yummy!

These are very easy to make and produce a quite unique "praline". Very good flavor in a nice crunchy cookie.
