Maybe the reason I did not like this was my own fault -- but I suspect it was the butterscotch chips. Since I do not like coffee, I substituted good cocoa powder. I used skim milk as well. As a result, the pudding was not overly rich, which in my book is a plus. However, I found that the pudding was much too sweet (those butterscotch chips are simply nasty -- they hold their shape and are so sweet and artificial tasting, I tried to pick them out). It has been sitting untouched in my refrigerator for the last 3 days, so that tells you something.
