Nice recipe. Xi hong shi ji dan is a classic.

I like to make this with whole tinned tomatos also becaues it makes it really juicy, and I really don´t see the point of doing the egg bit first. I live in Colombia and it is a daily breakfast dish here. My family in Scotland call it "Colombian scrambled eggs" Here it is called "Huevos pericos"

Very yummy - tasted much better than it looked. Very saucy and savory. Serve it with a bagel but could see how this would be great over rice. Couldn't wait to eat the leftovers this morning. Definately need in-season garden tomatoes to make this work. My only question is wondering if the pre-cook of the egg at the beginning is truly a value added step. I did do this but it seemed rather pointless.

We were dubious but curious. Wow, this is really great and so easy to make. A lovely summer dinner using up leftover rice from a previous take out. Go for it, you'll be surprised how good it is.

i made this exactly as listed and rolled it in corn tortillas (i know, i know, but i've got dozens of them i need to eat in the next few days). the little bit of tomato liquid really makes a difference in the eggs - they turned out delicate and juicy and tasty. as with any recipe that uses so few ingredients, i'd recommend busting out the good stuff - i used my farmer's market 'maters and eggs. simple and delicious!

I forgot the sugar and didn't use much salt, but I'm a fan of bland so it didn't bother me none! It was delicious. I also added mushrooms, green peppers and half a squash to the ingridients. I substituted a white onion for the scallions. Lots of changes, but the base of the recipe was intact and enjoyable.

This is the first recipe I tried on here, all in all I think its not spectacular, but still pretty good. It turns out pretty much how you imagine it on reading the recipe, it looks a bit messy but tastes much better than it looks. The only thing I'd say about this is to use nice quality eggs: adding tomato to cheap & nasty eggs will not only smell terrible but bring out a kind of metallic flavour which will probably ruin the taste. Failing that don't skimp on the spring onions (scallions to all you across the pond- onion generally reduces this effect) and make sure your tomatoes are properly cooked before putting egg anywhere near them. I tried it with buttered toast instead of the scrambled eggs I'd usually go for (don't all object at once) and it was worth the effort. It may taste better as on rice as suggested... I may try that, if I can get over the idea of eating a tomato omlette for dinner.

My husband and I lived in Southern China for a year and this was one of our favorite dishes there. Now that we're back in America it's high on our list of "comfort food" items. We add garlic and fresh ginger to the tomatoes and we like it best served over Jasmine rice. The riper the tomato the better with this recipe.
