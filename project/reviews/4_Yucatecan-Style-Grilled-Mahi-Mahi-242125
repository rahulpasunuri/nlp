Made my own spice rub using very similar ingredients to achiote, and used foil packets instead of banana leaves, but this was very good, and great dish for company because I could do it all in advance and just pop the packets on the grill. It was time-consuming with washing and chopping all the ingredients, but worthwhile. The salsa and onions were also good, and necessary garnishes for presentation... the sum was not greater than the parts, but with good parts, they are recipes to definitely repeat.

I used cod (while on Cape Cod) and cilantro instead of epazote. The presentation was wonderful. Everyone raved about it but I wasn't impressed. Maybe my guests were being polite. Maybe its just me, I guess I just don't care for the achiote.

Very interesting and fun to make recipe and it's really quite simple. I didn't get the onions started a day ahead and they do need that. The salsa has a big 'kick' and both accompaniments are worth the effort. I don't think, other than presentation, that the sliced tomatoes and limes add much, unless of course, you don't make the onions and salsa. The fish turned out so moist and flavorful. It's hard to tell when it's done because of the banana leaf but 10 minutes was right on for us. I took others suggestion and made the Mexican rice with Cilantro dressing for a great dinner.

We loved this! I was late in finding it, so I didn't pickle the onions, just grilled them with lime & cumin and they were a nice side. We also did the salsa, but used serrano and arbol chiles. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the crust had an earthy contrast to the sweetness of the fish. Wish I had thought to get some plantains as well!

what a great recipe! I followed every step and between the onions (you must make them...)the salsa and the mahi mahi, it took less than 1 hour prep time. I served this great fish with boiled yuca (cassava root) with olive oil, and i purchased some very nice and ripe plantains and scored them (put some olive oil and butter inside and outside) and grilled them in the bbq. they take 30 minutes.the combination was perfect!!!!!!will definitely do it again.

Took me 3 hours from start to finish and worth it. I went to the Mexican market and got the achiote, epazote and banana leaves but nobody had mahi-mahi so I bought opah. This is a keeper; very tasty and unique. I made the Mexican rice with cilantro dressing and it paired well. When I made the rice I didn't have white rice, so I used what I had: 1/2 long grain brown rice and 1/2 short grain brown rice. I would definately make this again.

A great recipe for bbqing with friends. Fish is delicious and it's fun to mess around with the banana leaves. Goes well with Mexican rice and salsa verde.

Our gourmet group loved this last night at our "Tres de Mayo" dinner. It's worth the trip to the Mexican market for the banana leaves (frozen), achiote and epazote. The grilled banana leaves impart a wonderful smoky nuance. Served with the pickled onions and habanero salsa (from the same article) and tortillas.
