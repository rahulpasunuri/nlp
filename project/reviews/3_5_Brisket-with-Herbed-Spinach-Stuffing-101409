Nope. New England boiled dinner is more exciting then this dish.

This dish went over very well with my family and guests. I doubled the spinach & thyme, added 1 tsp nutmeg. Also, instead of matzo sheets, I used 2C. of Matzo farfel. The brisket was 8 lbs.

The brisket itself was pretty tasty, though would have been more so if cooked longer. The onions added over and under the meat added a nice flavor. The disappointing part was the stuffing - I found it very bland. My husband didn't like it at all.

Made this for a Passover entree for the second year in a row, and it was even better this time around. Last year, I cut a sloppy pocket. This year, the kosher butcher cut the pocket, but a lot of sewing was required. Made larger (7 lb) brisket so left it in the oven an extra 30 minutes after oven was turned off. Doubled stuffing recipe. Everyone loved it. Sophisticated and delicious!

This was very good and looked beautiful. My husband loved it, kids not crazy about it so I probably won't make it again. I used fresh spinach minced in a food processor instead of frozen - the taste and color was great. I would use this stuffing recipe in other meats (will try it w/lamb or pork). Guess we're just not big on brisket.

My husband and I tried this recipe for the first time and it turned out excellent. The brisket was tender. The spinach stuffing enhances the brisket. We would made this not just for passover but for other occasions too.

I've made this a couple of times and it's wonderful. I substitute bread crumbs for the matzo and use 1/2 c. parmeasan cheese.

This brisket is WONDERFUL!! A great dish for guests and even better when made the day before. I have shared the recipe many times since I first made it.
