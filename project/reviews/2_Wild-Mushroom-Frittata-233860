I only had 1/4lb of mushrooms so I put in pasilla to compensate. It was good enough. Next time though, all mushrooms. It was super runny and gross the first time I tested its doneness. I guess I baked it for at least 15 to 20 minutes at 350. I forgot the lemon. Darn.

Wild-mushroom are expensive - use some baby bella's to save cost. 3/4 lb of mushrooms in a 6 inch pan is a bit overwhelming - use a large pan and when finishing go back to the 6 in. pan. Since you are going exotic - use the whole egg - it makes for a better frittata.

This recipe was good but not great. I have better frittata recipes and I'm not sure if I will make this again. My husband said that he liked it but that he was sick of mushrooms after about half of it.
