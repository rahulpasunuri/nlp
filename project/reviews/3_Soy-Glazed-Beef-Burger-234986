while I didn't dislike the flavor, its not what I'm looking for in a burger. I also found the texture a bit odd. I only made a 1/2 recipe, and didn't include the egg, but I can't imagine that would make that much difference. If you're looking for something different, give this a try. Otherwise, you may want to look further

miso should last a year & can be found my Japanese groc or Whole Foods groc. here in Columbus Ohio. Should be easier in Bay area

Surprisingly excellent, yet simple recipe. Didn't have sake, so substituted white wine, and instead of panko, used whole wheat bread and turned out perfectly. I served it w/Japanese-style sauteed spinach. Very impressed!

not a review....just a question...does anyone know how long you can keep miso (refrigerated, of course)

Where did people find dark miso? I live in the Bay Area and I couldn't find it! Was pretty good without it but I'm sure it would have helped the flavor.

This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly other than using buffalo instead of chuck. The burgers were moist and incredibly flavorful. I will make these again and again. I served them with steamed bok choy and potatos braised in dashi. Fabulous!

made this last night for my meat & potatos husband who said just make me a plain burger, please. He got up from the table to get his seconds very quickly.My 20 year old daughter asked whats in it , it's really good.Served on a bun & will definitely make it again. I also used white wine instead of sake, same effect.
