This stuffing is great with a few changes. First I used as many fresh herbs as possible and I used 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary. Then I added 1 whole cooked tube of Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage. This really made it delicious. Also, don't skip the Old Fashioned Cornbread recipe for this, all others are way too sweet. Enjoy!!

I was disappointed by this stuffing. The lima beans were dry, and the combination of ingredients was awkward. Compared to the roasted turkey with bourbon gravy, this was a real let down. Next time, I will try stuffing my turkey with a different cornbread stuffing recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and I liked it, but didn't love it. I have to admit, I used the Whole Foods brand cornbread mix and it maybe that's what made the stuffing way too sweet for my taste (next time I'll find real Southern cornbread (salty, not sweet)). Thank goodness I added some Polish sausage, that actually gave it a great kick. My guests liked it a lot.
