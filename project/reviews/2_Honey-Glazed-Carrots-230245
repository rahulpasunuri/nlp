You'll only like this dish if you like mint. I omitted the leak, cumin and cinnamon. Less complicated and it turned out good.

Maybe I should have guessed from the lack of other reviews - but this was a tremendous disappointment. I think what really ruined the dish is the cumin - the combination of flavors was bizarre and tasted as unpleasant as it smelled. There are so many other glazed carrot recipes here, go find one!
