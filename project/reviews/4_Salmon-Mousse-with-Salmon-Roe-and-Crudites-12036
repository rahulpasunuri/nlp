I have been making this for years, darn near every Thanksgiving. As other reviewers have mentioned, I don't use canned salmon, I use fresh poached. I also don't whip the cream. In my opinion, whipping the cream makes it too airy. I add the cream, I just don't whip it. I use a fish mould to shape it and rarely have leftovers but I don't mind at all when I do.

I served this on some cucumber slices that I'd drained for a few minutes on paper towels. It is very good, but it makes a lot.

I made this with a bit extra Tobasco and a pinch of cayenne as other reviewers said. The texture was wonderful, but the flavor was a bit too light for my taste. Also, I think it tastes much better on crostini or a peice of bagel or bread instead of the crudites.

Made this for for a party and loved it! We had some spread on bagels the next day and it was also delicious. Very good.

Easy to make, added more Tabasco and added a dash of Garlic. Used a round mold and topped it with red caviar. Light, not overpowering and beautiful.

I'm giving it a tentative four forks only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly, so not sure how it would taste without my additions. I used poached salmon instead of canned salmon, which I liberally seasoned with dill, white pepper, salt and garlic powder (poaching liquid was white wine and lemon). I also added more seasonings to the overall recipe: quite a bit of dill, lemon zest, a lot more hot sauce, and garlic powder. This makes a great presentation: turned out salmon from a fish mould, and served the caviar (I used reg. instead of salmon roe because I like the way the taste compliments the mousse) in inverted sea shells. Decorated the periphery of the tray with dill sprigs, lemon slice twists, and edamame (my only crudite). Served it all with garlic crostini. Easy to make, but looks very impressive! Every time I've made this, people love it, and there are never any leftovers (bummer):)

I made this for 80 people for a wine dinner last weekend (3/16/02). Nearly everyone liked it and several people asked for take-home bags (I made much more than I needed, per usual). It's fairly easy to make. The rotten part was separating the canned salmon from its skin. I didn't do the crudite, but provided thinly sliced French sourdough bread, which I think complimented the mousse very well. And I couldn't get any roe, but since the eighty didn't know that what's to worry?

I used baked salmon instead of smoked and canned salmon and used horseradish instead of tabasco. The mousse texture was wonderful - light and fluffy. The only drawback was that the sour cream seemed to overpower the salmon taste. I'll use less sour cream next time.

I've made this recipe dozens of times since I first saw it in my June '93 issue of Gourmet. I add a few extra drops of Tabasco and a pinch of cayenne to enhance the flavor. In addition to using various molds, I've also piped the mousse into pate a choux, onto puff pastry rounds, mini toasts and celery rib 'bites'. It's also great spread on bagels.

I served this to about 40 people at my annual Christmas party - cocktails and a buffet. It was a big hit! Very light and airy, not too "fishy". It does need some "zip"... I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, chopped fresh dill and some extra lemon juice. I poured it into a fish shaped mold and refrigerated overnight. After unmolding, I decorated the top with paper thin slices of radishes cut in half to make "fish scales", chives to make the tail outline and a slice of pimento stuffed olive for the "fish eye". I decorated the plate with lemon slices and dill. Served with crackers, this got rave reviews. We know our salmon here in Seattle, and this is a winner!!!

Iwanted to serve something light as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and this was perfect! It received raves from all ages (6yrs - 75yrs) and I will definitely make it for future dinner parties. My only suggestion is that it does need more of a "kick", so I'd use regular lox instead of nova.
