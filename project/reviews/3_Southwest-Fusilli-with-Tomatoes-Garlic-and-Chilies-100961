Good recipe with different flavors for a pasta sauce. I don't know what people did to this recipe to say it was bland. It is very tasty. I used chopped Serrano and banana peppers and found this to be a nice amount of flavor. I also did not add the extra fresh cilantro at the end, since I had no more, but I added some dried cilantro and it worked fine. I am not sure that the feta is the best cheese, but it was good...just not really southwest. Overall, a keeper, and I will definitely make it again

Caveat: I used heirloom tomatoes and the wrong kind of pasta, but I doubt that would have taken it from lackluster to amazing. This felt like just a weird Southwest pasta salad and the feta didn't seem to work all that well in it either. As I served it I just heard Gordon Ramsey in my head saying "What the *!@#% is this?"

I love this one. Make it with grilled chicken and added to the recipe for a great dinner. This is a great summer salad for picnics and everyone who has tried it, loved it. Heirloom tomatoes or otherwise lack flavor if not grown in compost, fertile soil, so don't blame the recipe if the tomatoes didn't produce.

Followed exactly except I only grow heirloom tomatoes. Nothing special at all. Tossed the recipe.

Great recipe with fantastic flavor! Follow the instructions and peel the tomatoes; it's fast and easy and the quality of the sauce is much better without the tomato skins. I added about 3 tbsp of capers (rinsed), more garlic (8 cloves) and since I wanted my kids to eat it, I used more chilies but ones with less heat (half of a jalapeno, half of an Anaheim, half of a Hungarian wax and half of a Banana pepper). I also used feta with sun dried tomatoes and basil mixed in; and garlic and basil tomato paste. Finally, I grilled three chicken breasts, sliced them and added them on top. The kids LOVED it and so did my wife and I. I think the amount of cilantro is appropriate and tastes wonderful. I'd also recommend going with at least the amount of olive oil recommended (many of the other reviewers reduced it). Good olive oil adds a lot to the overall flavor, it doesn't make it "greasy" and olive oil is a GOOD fat and good for you. Don't skimp, just make sure you use a quality extra virgin. America's Test Kitchen ranks Da Vinci extra virgin the best tasting of the supermarket oils. Try it.

I searched high and low for cotija cheese after all the comments about the feta. Couldnt find any-where to buy cotija in NYC?? Anyway, turned out fine with the feta. Next time I will add black beans, maybe some corn, and definitely more chilis--I like it spicy!!

I was worried about how this dish would turn out at first but was pleasantly surprised. The only thing it needs is a fair amount of salt and pepper to really bring out the other flavors.

Great for a summer dish. This has lots of flavor and color and turned out delicious. I can only imagine it at a picnic or bbq. Very tasty!

Mmm! With very ripe tomatoes from the garden, this dish was WONDERFUL! I want to make this again and again. Even though I had a bit of a salt accident (the lid wasn't screwed on), it turned out very well! Because of the feta cheese, it doesn't taste very Southwestern, but it was still great; the flavor knocks me out (in a very good way). For me, it worked with only 2 T. of olive oil.

This recipe came out well. I did cook the ingredients a bit, and it seemed to improve it. Would definitely make it again.

I thought this dish to be very delicious. The only thing I would suggest, is not adding so much cilantro. It (in my opinion) seemed to over-power the rest of the ingredients. Instead of 2/3 cup, try 1/3 (depending on your taste). I only put in 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of 1/3 and that was plenty. I added some chicken to it. Nice addition. I also served it warm and instead of eating the sauce raw, I cooked them in an iron pan for about 7-10 minutes on low heat. Other then that I will certainly make this dish again! Can't wait to try it cold. :)

What a great low-cook summer dish! The flavor is surprisingly complex but the whole thing relies on good tomatoes. And it's healthy, too!

Glad to have such a good "no cook" pasta sauce recipe. Like others, I did not add the feta as it just didn't seem like a "fit" to me, but others might see differently. Also, rather than using the tomato recipe, I simply diced two pints of grape tomatoes. Easy and delicious! KIMBER

I didn't have time to fuss with the tomatoes, so I substituted 3 16oz cans of diced tomatoes, and it turned out great! It was so fast and all three of my kids liked it. We printed it up and put it in our "use again" file.

This dish was delicious but too spicy. I used 3 serrano peppers and it nearly knocked me off the couch. Next time I will use only 1 or maybe jalapenos. Other than that, it was excellent!

This dish was O.K., but I don't feta is the cheese to use. If I make this again I'll try a mexican cheese. The feta just tasted wierd with the other ingredients.

Not normally a fan of uncooked sauces for pasta, but this one is very good. I used cherry tomatoes and like several other reviewers skipped the peeling. By mistake, I forgot the tomato paste, but it was perfect anyway. Leftovers were good for lunch next day.

Would not make this again. Flavors just did not work for me.

I made this upon request for my partner. I've never understood cilantro (to me it tastes like dish soap) so I substituted half of the called for amount with parsely. Decent recipe.

Very easy and tasty. A nice twist for a pasta receipe. The only thing I thought it needed was a bit more liquid in the sauce. The cilantro makes the dish.

I didn't peel or seed the tomatoes. I don't know how my version compares to those who did, but I can't believe it could have been better. The flavor was incredible--but not overpowering. I served it at room temperature, which was a delightful and welcomed change in the hot weather. I'm not sure I'd like this pasta served hot. Can't wait to try this one again!

YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS DISH! We loved it. Peeling the tomatoes is fast and easy if you follow the directions It lost a bit of its zip the next day when I ate the leftover for lunch, but it was still good.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. It was different, flavor-wise than others I have made because of the chili powder and peppers. But very good. I tried it without peeling the tomatoes and it was absolutely fine. It saved a lot of time and there is enough chopping to do without peeling tomatoes too. I did seed them however.

Fantastic! For a twist, I tried smoking the tomatoes in my Hibachi pot. The skins came right off with no fuss, and it deepened the flavor.

This is a great and easy pasta dish. have served it many times to rave reviews. You can make it a bit spicier with a little extra chili powder, otherwise its great!

I love this recipe, however peeling the tomatoes is very time consuming. It's great hot or cold.
