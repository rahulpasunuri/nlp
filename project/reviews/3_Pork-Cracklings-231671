I made this with the pork roast recipe. My husband ate one and said "Wait a minute. What the heck is it you get in the grocery stores in the bag?!!" No comparing the two! So unhealthy, such an incredible treat! Not an everyday diet choice, but once or twice a year - worth it blowing the calorie count. It is important to turn on your vent and occasionaly crack your oven door to allow smoke to vent out.

Totally unhealthy, A HUGE mess in my oven, smoke (unavoidable when cooking fat), plus a total hassle to find the pork. Makes Spaghetti Carbonara look like spa-food. Never again.

I'm an orthodox jew and was tricked into eating this pork. My friend told me it was beef. Surprisingly it was incredible. I'm no longer kosher!!!

almost like my grandma used to make. she didn't use the fennel, but lots of salt and some black pepper. she also did them on top of the stove, slowly over low heat, but this way makes less mess of your stove top. so good!
