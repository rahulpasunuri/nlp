An absolute fave! For those of you reading the recipe / reviews and wondering if you should take the plunge, I would say go for it AND know that you may need to adjust the amount of some ingredients to suit your taste. I add way more green curry, coriander and salt than what is called for because that's the taste I like. Be adventurous! Use the great foundation recipe and play with it to make it your own.

I haven't made this recipe yet, because there are things about the way it's written that make me question whether it's worth trying. First, it says "5-1/2 hours total time" start to finish. Hmmmm....reading the recipe, it's only around 50 minutes total time. Then, it says "8 main-course servings." Again, a big HMMMMMM....How does 1 cup of rice, 3/4 lb. chicken breast, and 1/4 pound snow peas translate to 8 main course servings? Sounds to me like a whole bunch of hungry dinner guests....

This soup was awesome. I love how the starch from cooking the rice into the soup made the broth thicker. It was fantastic. I happened not to have coconut milk on hand. It would have been good with it. but I think it was equally good without. I threw in a couple of diced kaffir lime leaves. I also don't happen to like snow peas. So instead I used frozen broccoli. Can't get any easier than that!

I don't understand the rave reviews for this soup. I made it exactly as written and, while it was not bad, it was extremely bland, which was quite a surprise given the flavorful ingredients that went into it.

Also, don't leave out the fish sauce. It is the umami, the fifth taste of the soup. You won't realize it is there but without it, you will certainly miss it.

I am reneging my last comment/review. I have been craving this soup often. I have made it twice since I reviewed it and continued with the lemongrass, mushrooms etc. It is darn yummy comfort food. I lovely twist on the classic chicken with rice soup.

Rating: 2
I was excited making this soup but it did come up somewhat bland. It is very comfort 'foodish'. I combined a bunch a suggestions such as... I lessened the broth content to a litre of chicken stock and 2 cups of water. I added lemongrass and one whole bunch of cilantro and simmered the base for over an hour. I added the chicken breast intact and cooked it then removed it and shredded. I added baby spinach and slivered mushrooms with the snow peas. I upped the fish sauce and green curry but I did use lite coconut milk. As suggested I cooked the jasmine rice seperately and ladled the soup over it in the serving bowl. It has all the flavours of a good Tom yum but no oomph. It is a very gentle version of it. Would I make it again?-- uh, maybe for children--it really is a 'baby' version.

Rating: 4
Exceptional based on my addition of chicken & shrimp to the recipe. I add twice the curry for kick, and throw in the shrimp for a subtle fish flavor not uncommon in a Thai dish (and not out of step with the fish sauce). Great, simple after work meal that you can enjoy for lunch the next day.

Made this soup the other night in my culinary arts class and it was delicious. I did make a few changes. As per a previous reviewer I simmered the stock for about 45 minutes to and hour before straining it. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, ginger, & cayenne ( a lot of cayenne due to an unintentional spill) and sauteed it in olive oil till brown then added it to the stock. I also used rice sticks instead of the jasmine rice. I added a can of coconut milk and then poured in some additional coconut cream. I added one more tablespoon of fish sauce to make it more salty. The dish turned out very well and I would probably make it again.

I have made this several times. I prefer shredded chicken because it absorbs the flavors better. Very tasty.

Rating: 2
I also drastically changed this recipe. The only thing I didn't add more of is water - I put in must one cup vs 5 cups of stock, and, despite adding lemongrass mushrooms and peppers it was still too thin and low on flavour. Oh, I used red paste. My wife saved it by realizing it needed a lot more salt, sugar and lime or lemon. Then it was excellent. This recipe is a good start, that's all.

Rating: 4
A really delicious soup that I have made numerous times. Not meant for leftovers unless you make the rice and snow peas separately. I can stand really hot, yet I find that a tbsp of green curry paste is a bit too much. You can always add later. Lime juice is a must. Great for a sick husband!

my husband and i LOVED this soup!! DELICIOUS!! i doubled the snow peas and tripled the curry paste for extra heat. i am so looking forward to eating this for lunch tomorrow. next time, i'm going to add more rice and try it with "lite" coconut milk - 1 can of regular coconut milk has over 100g of fat. shrimp sounds terrific as well. we "chowed" this!!

Great for a wintry night. I make this all the time, but leave out the water, and add cilantro stems to the broth along with the leaves. I've used both shrimp and chicken and prefer the shrimp.

I wish I loved this soup. The ingredients look like a combination that I would love, but alas - it's one of those dishes that when I made it last time, I ended up looking in the refrigerator day after day (in part because it makes so much) thinking - Egad, it's still there. Anyway, this time I experimented to try to give it a fuller, deeper taste. First, I boiled the stock and the first set of ingredients covered for about 45 mintues before straining. In addition, I added about 1/2 cup basil. My next change was to sprinkle the chicken (I used 1/2 chicken and 1/2 shrimp)with salt, pepper, and pinches of ginger and cayenne before browning it separately. My next change was to add a 1/2 cup basil with the 1/2 cup cilantro, and finally I chopped a bunch of green onions to be added as a garnish into each bowl of soup. It was better this time, but still not as good as I think it should be. My boyfriend however is looking over my shoulder as I write this review trying to get me to give it 3 forks and telling me it was delicious. Guess that means I'll make it again, but I'm not done playing around with it.

Great soup. Just the right amount of heat. Next time I make it I will cut the broth in half as suggested by other reviews. Great flavours!

Yum! As per other reviews, here is what I changed: cut liquid to 6 cups broth (half vege, half chicken - that is just what I prefer) and 2 cups water, added more spice (used red pepper flakes since I only had red curry), and cooked the starch separately (used rice noodles). My own additions/changes: broiled the chicken (I used breasts) with chile oil and cilantro before adding to soup, added shredded cabbage (about 2 cups) and thinly sliced escarole. Very tasty, very satisfying, and very easy to modify! Have fun with it!

For me it was just OK - I felt that if I was going through all this prep anyway, why not just make Thai green curry proper?? The flavors in this soup are weak but as I'm used to spicy curry was probably expecting more flavor. Tried adding lemograss, k. lime . . . didn't help.

I, too, cooked the rice separately. I halved the recipe but kept the original amount of Thai green curry paste. I used a combination of chicken, shrimp and crabmeat, and added a small can of straw mushrooms. Mmmm, was it good.

Excellent one dish meal! One suggestion for making this a little faster/easier clean up: if you can get those soup "bags" (they're made of cheesecloth) then all you have to do it put the whole cilantro (why destem?), ginger, lemongrass, etc into it, tie it up and fish it out after simmering. I tied the smashed coriander seeds into a small piece of doubled-cheesecloth tied with a string, also to be fished out later. That way, all you have to do is pluck it out with tongs, let it cool, squeeze out the excess broth to dump back into the pot and you can skip the straining step. If you can't find the bags then just use cheesecloth and tie it up.

Made this soup yesterday with delicious results. Used a combination of shrimp and chicken and everyone loved it. My only deviation from the recipe was my use of basmati instead of jasmine rice and after refrigeration for a day, it was wonderfully tasty and not overwhelmed by mushy rice.

Rating: 3
This was surprisingly easy and excellent. Used both shrimp and chicken and decreased the chicken broth by half to emphasize the coconut milk base. Also added the rice separately. Strongly recommend squeezing fresh lime juice in at the end, as it truley brightens the dish. With the decrease in broth, the quantity is appropriate for four adults. Manipulate the green curry for desired heat - as posted it is mild.

Wonderful and simple. Made with chicken. Did not add water, and did make rice separately as others suggested.

Excelent soup. Do not leave out the coconut milk (look for another recipe if you don't like it), it makes the soup. I'll try with shrimp next time.

As with most recipes, this is a standard recipe with the basic, if not manditory ingredients. While I am sure that people who made this with red curry instead enjoyed it, they missed out on the point of the recipe. I agree with some of the additions that members made... the lemongrass, thai basil, etc. which are true standard thai ingredients but some of the substitutions or additions were not truly in the thai tradition. Using fish boullion? Fish sauce is essential as is the coconut milk. If you rated this low, but changed any of the essential ingredients, you should not have rated it at all.

I use tons of thai basil in this, when I can get it. I cook the rice separately, and just ladle the soup over when serving. I store the leftovers separately, as well, so the rice is never saturated and mushy. Another reviewer may have suggested this already, but 89 reviews was just too many to read. Sorry if I'm repeating previous advice.

My husband had been asking me if we could make the type of coconut milk based soup that we find on Thai menus. This turned out to be it. The snow peas are just one possible vegetable that could be used. We used scallions and baby spinach.

I was surprised at how much I liked this soup. I completed the soup, using chicken, without adding the snow peas. This allowed me to add a different kind of steamed vegetable every day for my lunches all week. The rice does get soft, but I don't mind that.

This is a very delicious soup. I made it exactly as written except I could not find green curry, so I used red instead.

Rating: 3
I loved it. With caveats: Didn't use rice as my husband has been on a (weird) "low carb" diet. Subbed bean thread noodles, which I've never used before: interesting gelatinous mass, which did separate nicely when added to hot soup, though entirely tasteless. Husband and daughter weren't quite sure what to make of them. Otherwise followed recipe fairly closely, except I used bnls, sknls thighs instead of breasts (it's what I had). I was actually looking for a recipe to use Thai basil, as I have a lovely plant growing on my deck. In addition to cilantro, was delish. Also, catering to my husband, used only 1 tsp green curry paste (he has acid reflux disease and can't eat too spicy) but I craved more heat! Also added some sliced mushrooms, which were delicious, as well as bean sprouts and lite coconut milk. Forgot to buy a lime, so used organic bottled (not from concentrate) lime juice. Not sure I could taste it! My son came home from work at 10:30 to microwaved leftovers and was not impressed. (He's never liked my homemade soups.) What's a mother to do? All in all, however, this is definitely a keeper!!!

I made such an abbreviated version of this soup, I can really only claim to have been inspired by the recipe, not to have actually made it. Nonetheless, it was delicious! I won't bore everyone with all my changes, but I would like to recommend my method for cooking the chicken: rather than slicing it as called for, I added the whole breasts to the broth (prior to the rice), and then pulled them out after they had cooked, shredded them with two forks, and then added the shredded chicken back into the soup. It was quick and easy, and the flavor and tenderness was incredible! This recipe is a keeper.

I thought this was great. I was a bit confused by the reveiwer who claimed it was bland but when making the dish made very poor substitutions that took away all the flavor - then blamed the recipe.

For whatever reason I expected this to be easier to make. Each step was simple, but I felt worn to a nub by the time it was all assembled. Initially we were not that impressed. But as we ate (each pouring a second bowl), we decided the soup was really pretty good. We tried a slight variation based on a very similar soup at a very popular Thai restaurant here: I added some coarse chopped fresh pineapple...maybe 3/4 cup. Next time I'll add a LOT of Thai basil just before serving.

I had a major problem. I substituted rice noodles for rice and shortly after I took it off the stove top it became thick goo. The flavors are fabulous and I will definitley make it again but word to the wise, cook the starch separately. I should have known better because rice noodles are so starchy. I used lite coconut milk and fat free low sodium broth and added some fresh lemongrass in the beginning step. I also added both chicken and shrimp. Next time I will add mushrooms as others suggested and I won't dare cook the noodles in the soup. It is very tasty.

Rating: 3
Very easy and tasty! I used lemongrass in place of cilantro (never liked that stuff), lite coconut milk, rice noodles, and shrimp.

I made a few adjustments to keep the soup fresh: Cooked the rice in advance with some of the broth and a bit of spice. The rice went into a container to use when the soup is ready to eat. Chopped up the pea pods, and extra cilantro and put them in storage containers too. Then all you have to do is heat up the soup, add the pea pods, and some extra cilantro (if desired) add a scoop of rice, and it's fresh every time. The fresh lime juice really makes this dish, so don't scrimp! I also added a bit of lemongrass, and I think next time I'll use a bit less green curry paste, as it was VERY hot. It may have been extra fresh, but I had to use some extra coconut milk when cooking and ample lime juice when presenting the soup to calm it down.

Rating: 2
This was very different but very good, AFTER I solved its blandness problem. I could only find red curry paste, and when making the stock mixture, tripled the amount of it. Added some dried stalky lemon grass. Only had ground coriander, and increased the amount slightly. Also added some ground curry powder. Doubled the amount of snow peas--we like veggies. Subbed some Wyler's powdered fish flavor for the fish sauce. When it was all done, it was still bland, so I added another portion of red curry paste and a generous sprinkle of black pepper. Now it was a 3-1/2 fork soup. Never did add any salt, as the canned fat-free, lower sodium broth and powdered fish flavor had enough. As it cooled down, however, it was too limey, so next time I would reduce the lime juice by 1/3.

I used chicken and added sliced snow peas. Delightful flavor, easy to make, and rave reviews from the lucky recipients of this soup.

I've used chicken bouillion cubes and plain water when making the broth and that is cheaper than buying cans of broth. As for the rice sucking up the soup, what I do is when I go to store some in the freezer, I pour the soup into a colander and divide the broth and the solids into separate containers. That way the rice doesn't sponge up all the broth. another thing I may try is cook the rice separately and spoon the rice into the soup when ready to serve. The broken bit jasmine is often sold cheaper and in smaller portions at Asian food markets.

This is one of my family's favorites! However, it does not refrigerate well, so you're better off eating it all the day it's made. Nevertheless, it's a special treat. I've tried with both chicken and shrimp. YUM!

This is the second time I make this soup and it was frankly even better this time! Why? Because I had to sub so much for lack of proper ingredients! I simmered the broth 30 minutes with whole basil leaves, ground ginger and ground coriander...the flavors were great! Added mushrooms and red peppers both times...they compliment the soup perfectly. Topped off with flat leaf parsley and chopped green onion instead of coriander, which we simply didn´t have. Very tasty! This will be made many times in the future, surely in many new variations!

What a great recipe. The flavors of this soup are amazing. I will definately make this again! I served it with a Thai salmon (sister's recipe) and one of Ming Tsai's recipes for an apple side dish. I love serving fruit with Thai food. In the summer, grilled peaches or pineapple would be nice.

Love the flavor of this soup and have made it 4 times. I am going to half the recipe for the rice because I found that it expands and takes over the broth. Doesnt refrigerate well, it get's mushy. This is a soup to make and eat the same day. I did let the first step ingredients infuse overnight before straining them for better flav..

Seemed pretty work-intensive but worth it. Next time I'll definitely skip de-stemming the cilantro for the first part of the recipe (a big D'OH when I realized I could have saved all that time). Next time I may add more green curry paste for additional flavor and spice. I had some leftover red pepper slices from another recipe and threw those in at the last minute - also tasty!

Rating: 4
So very tasty!! I made the recipe pretty much as stated and liked it that way. For the broth, I used whole cilantro stems instead of just the leaves, just because it's faster. The chicken got a little overcooked because fresh snow peas can take longer than 2 minutes, even for tender-crisp. Consider throwing the snow peas in sooner.

I've made this soup twice now and kept the ingredients pretty much exact. Prob. a good idea to cut the salt to a half teaspoon. You can also adjust the spicyness by adding or subtracting some green curry paste. That stuff has some heat. Definitely load up on the cilantro. Good with some crusty bread for dipping.

Fish sauce is extremely important in southeast Asian cooking. It may smell terrible in the bottle (we call it cat-breath sauce & the cat loves it drizzled on her food), but it really makes the flavors stand out & takes it to the next level.

I loved it! I didn't have enough shrimp so I added some monkfish fillets cut into shrimp-size pieces and it was excellent. I also used bouillon cubes (instead of making broth) and frozen snow peas thus cutting the prep time significantly but not the flavor, I think. Would use a couple of lemon leaves next time.

This is such a flavourful soup! I agree with the others though that it needs some more citrus flavour. I'll be adding the juice of 2-3 limes, plus some red pepper or carrot for colour. Also, it took so long to strain the broth through the sieve lined with paper towel. Next time I'll try cheesecloth.

Fantastic!!! I have made this twice now, once with the Green Curry and the second time with the Red Curry. Excellent! Every bit,,, GONE! I did add one thing, not big but it added tremendously.

I made this last night and it was wonderful. I had most everything on hand but had to use: yellow curry paste, ground coriander, basmati rice and sugar snap peas. I doubt any of those substitutions changed the flavor very much. I love cilantro so I wouldn't reduce the amount. I use stems and all (cilantro stems are actually sweeter, unlike parsley stems). I will use light coconut milk next time. I like the idea of matchstick carrots for color mentioned by a previous reviewer. This soup smelled and tasted just great!

This soup was quick to make and so extremely delicious to smell coming in from outside....and just as delicious to eat. I used Oxo chicken packets instead of making my own broth. The blend of flavours was superb with the cilantro and spices. I used red curry paste and it worked very well. I made the soup tonight after a huge snow storm dumped about 2 feet of snow outside with more to come. My son & I were the only ones home for dinner and this soup was such a wonderful blend of flavours that we kept refilling our bowls. It was very comforting to eat after shovelling snow. I used both shrimp (smaller ones) and chicken and it was simply terrific. Don't leave out the lime - it is a must!! A definite keeper.

This was amazing. The fragrance as it was cooking was indescribable! We've been to Thailand and I remember a soup very much like this one and this was every bit as good! I served it to guests with shrimp & pork fresh spring rolls and a (take-out) Vietnamese beef salad and everyone loved it. The soup is just spicy enough without being overpowering and fine even for the more delicate-palates at the table. We used both chicken and shrimp and would do exactly the same again. Would change nothing!!

i made this a 2nd time and just love it. in response to the previous reader, yes, fish sauce is usually the key ingredient, at least in my experience. just be prepared for the smell, which is totally unappetizing. my description of the smell is worse than rotten fish :) but an extremely important ingredient. wouldn't know how/what to sub with. i find it next to soy sauce in the groc store. good luck

Liked the outcome but wasn't as impressed as expected from the reviews. Like some other reviewers, I reduced the amount of broth and water but might try it as written another time since it didn't ended up soupy at all. I couldn't find fish sauce and had to leave that out - maybe that's the key ingredient? Is there anything else I use instead of that? Other than that I made it as directed, using shrimp instead of chicken. I would try a combination of chicken and shrimp next time.

I was not impressed, but I'm not sure why. I love all the ingredients in this dish. I love soup, I love Thai food, and I believe that limes, coconut milk and cilantro are God's little gifts to us. But this just didn't do it for me, for reasons I'm not able to explain. I found it bland an uninspiring, even after attempting to salvage it with extra fish sauce, lime, cilantro and even chili sauce. Sadly, I doubt I would make this again.

This was so good and had a nice "kick" to it. I made the stock the night before. I really can't imagine this soup being very good using canned broth. I made our soup with chicken breasts, which was great, but next time I think I might do a combination of both chicken and shrimp. Yum!

Just got done making and eating this soup and it was delicious!! wouldn't change a thing about it. maybe next time I'll use lite coconut milk and see how it comes out. the husband and 15 year old daughter loved it.

Very good recipe. I used 2 Tbls Panang curry paste instead of the green curry paste, added lemon grass and Kaffir lime leaves which added flavor. Would reduce the amount of water added too.

This soup is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly. It has a wonderful variety of flavor sensations. I sliced the semi-thawed chicken in my food processor using the slicing blade. It came out perfect. Try it you'll like it!

This was great. I did not add the curry paste because I was feeding it to kids as well as myself. I added my own paste in my serving. I would say that there is far too much liquid. Even though it is good I might be tempted to cut the 2 cups of water at the very least, or add more rice, chicken and snowpeas to balance it all out. Pretty wonderful and quick.

We love Thai food, but 2 out of 3 of us did not really enjoy this. It was okay, but wonèt be making it again.

to cook from vegas and hite.1; this particular soup is meant to be more sour. traditionally, you add a little crushed thai pepper and chile oil at the end. lemongrass is used for tom kar gai which is similiar to this soup . this version is good though,.

Unless it states rice,cooked in the ingredient list, it's safe to assume that it's uncooked rice.

To hite.1, I know what you mean about that citrus punch and that's why I add Kaffir lime leaves. You can also boost it along with lemongrass. This really is a great soup with the added punch. Kaffir lime leaves can be found on the internet or in Asian supermarkets.

This was so easy and just divine. I used shrimp and substituted panang curry for the green. We couldn't believe how distinct the flavors were - curry, heat, cilantro, lime, sweet peas - I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow! Definitely a keeper.

Loving real Thai soup I think I was expecting something else. Rice seemed odd in this soup. I expected a stronger citrus-flavor.

Quite simply, an extraordinary dish. Extremely easy to prepare -- I will make it again and again.

sorry about this- but is the rice already cooked before you add it or does it cook in the broth- real beginner at cooking

I was told "This is the best soup I have ever had!"Start to finish was 35 Minutes (not 50). A different curry was substituted for the green thai curry. I also chose fish boulion (Magi) as a substitute. Each cube makes 2 cups of broth, I used 1/8-1/4 tsp of the cube dry and put it in the soup. ENJOY!

This is one of the best soups I've had in a long time. It's so easy to make - I used Swanson low sodium chicken broth instead of homemade. I was impressed with the amount of flavor!

Margo and I prepared an entire Asian dinner and this was the centerpiece. As Margo says, "a taste sensation." We used shrimp and prepared the base in advance. The last ingredients were added just before serving. Incredible flavors!

I have been cooking recipies from this website for about six months and this one has been on of the best. It was simple to make and tasted delicious. I will definitely make this again.

If you substitute cilantro with basil, make sure you use Thai basil. In addition, I would add a few slices of lemon grass to maintain the Thai flavor.

I would bet that basil would be good, and still very Thai, if you didn't like cilantro.

In answer to the previous post, nothing is going to give you a similar flavor to cilantro. However, if you jsut want to add some color, you could add flat leaf parsley, although in a lesser amount. For flavor I would sub fresh basil, as it is very common in Thai recipes...maybe half parsley and half basil?

I was so impressed with the reviews I have to ask: Is there anything a cook can substitute if she cannot take cilantro at all?

Wonderful soup. Just the right amount of heat. Used canned broth plus water and it was fine. Just need to slice the beans smaller. A real treat that made us long for Thai food.

The broth could be made ahead and frozen. Than thaw, and begin from the poach chicken or shrimp part. I'm going to try it with strips of fried tofu put into warm next time I have to feed vegans.

Absolutely to die for! Do you think this is freezable/make ahead?

I just got back from a week in bangkok and this recipe was so authentic that I felt I was still there. I made it with shrimp and followed exactly the recipe except that I used 26-30 count per lb shrimp because they were already deveined and peeled at the grocer. Just the right amount of spice, medium hot and so flavorful.

The flavors are exquisite, and the spiciness perfect. This is a delicious soup. I used shrimp instead of chicken, and did not have all day to cook the stock, so I used bouillon cubes instead. Next time, I shall try it with stock. My wife was apprehensive about this soup, but she loved it!
