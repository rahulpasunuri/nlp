I liked this. It wasn't anything special, but it was pleasant. I'd make it again if I wanted a quick plum dessert.

Was just okay... will try it again if I come across really ripe plums, otherwise the plum flavor is just too subtle.

I can't fairly rate this recipe with forks because the plums I had (Italian prune plums) were so sour (very unusual) that I had to cook them in the sugar and orange juice mixture for 10 minutes in the microwave. I might add that it was pretty tasty. Next time though, I'll use regular plums and am sure it will be delicious as everyone said it was.

Nice combination of flavors. Good for you, too! Easy to make. I used very ripe plums from our tree and freshly squeezed Valencia O.J. Will definitely make again!

I've made this dish many times and it's the perfect summer desert. It's one of my favorite ways for eating plums!

Harmonius and, obviously, very easy to make. Makes a wonderful summer light dessert or an afternoon snack all by itself. I would not make it with underripe fruit though.

This was a simple easy desert with an interesting combination of flavors. Very refreshing and low cal too. I served it with Biscotti ice cream sandwiches but used store bought biscotti/
