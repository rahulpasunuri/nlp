Loved this -- mde it as an appetizer for dinner last night. SO said he would have been just to have more of these for dinner which is high praise.

I made this yesterday for a Christmas party with some friends and loved it so much I made it again today but mixed pesto, mushrooms and asiago cheese in with the cream cheese and used finely chopped baked salmon instead of smoked and it worked out great for a light dinner. The crepes are very versatile

I have been making this recipe ever since it was published. I find the presentation great and I make it once a year. My husband looks forward to Easter morning every year!

Excellent taste but slightly on the dry side and perhaps could be improved by using a sauce, flavoured or not

I forgot to mention that thinkly sliced cucumbers or chopped red onions can be substituted for the radish if you desire. Many possibilities with this recipe!

So easy, so elegant, so popular. I love these crepes, pretty and tasty and very easy to make in a non-stick pan. Last time I made these, I used an herbed "alouette" spreadble cheese instead of the cream cheese mixture and that was a great hit.

I love this recipe - it was a huge hit at a recent cocktail party. I doubled the recipe, used a 7-inch pan, and got 5 rolls - sliced to about 25 hors d'oevres. I also substituted soft goat cheese for the the cream cheese (personal preference) and omitted the lemon, since the goat cheese is tart to begin with. I grated the radishes rather than julienne cut. Loved it! Wish I had some right now...

A GOOD HORS D'OEUVRE FOR A LARGE PARTY IF DOUBLING THE RECIPE AND SLICING IN THIN ROUNDS. I MADE THE CREPES A WEEK AHEAD AND THEY FROZE WELL. I USED MORE LEMON AND LEMON ZEST. i SERVED WITH THE HAM AND WATERCRESS CREPES ON A PLATTER AND THE COLOR SWIRLS WERE GREAT FOR PRESENTATION. BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE GOING TO SUCH TROUBLE FOR TWO SERVINGS.

These were just okay. Not too hard so I might try again, but nothing outstanding.

This is easier to make than I've imagined. It makes a nice party food. I would make more crepe though for the amount of cream cheese.

I have made this dish many times for parties and it is always a big hit but with the following changes-- 1)I use very finely chopped red onion in the filling, and it needs salt, so I soak the chopped radishes in salt water and drain before assembling.

My most-used lunch recipe! One can use this as a starting point for a huge variety of other crepe dishes: I often make the crepes (tarragon is the best in these) but fill them with other ingredients, such as ham, shredded vegetables, creamed spinach.

I tripled the recipe, would be silly to make such a small amount. My husband liked it but said it had too much pepper. He still ate it though! It looked nice!

the directions were very complete and I was able to make the crepe (the scariest part!). tasty, but could be larger portions

Delicious. I was probably a little heavy on the herbs and lemon which may for great flavour. Omitted the radish as neither of us like it and it was wonderful. A perfect light appetizer with champagne to start a meal.

I thought this was okay but not great. It seemed a little bland. The crepes were easier to make than I thought they would be and when assembled and cut into pieces, it looks impressive. Plus, it includes smoked salmon which is always a hit. I'd make it again, but maybe add capers or a small amount of tomato to the filling.

Perfect! I also served the crepes (w/o cutting them) with extra cream cheese mixture over the top as a sauce (thinned out with milk). Great for brunch!

This was a wonderfully tasty and attractive appetizer served with champagne on Valentine's Day. The crepe recipe worked fine, and the crepes froze nicely. We doubled the filling recipe. It's important to assemble it the same day because it loses something the next day.

This tasted wonderful and looked incredible as well. I made this for Valentines day with the lobster salad and venison with green peppercorns. It was a nice light appetizer before a heavy entree. I used scallions instead of chives, which was fine. I found that the crepe batter worked perfectly. Use the leftover ingredients for "smoked salmon and cream cheese fritatta" the next morning.

These were good and definitely aesthetically pleasing - though I think more of a brunch food than dinner. Initially I thought it sounded like not enough salmon, so I used a little more - but ended up being too much. Also make sure to use a 10-inch pan, or the crepes will be too thick. Overall, very good. If you don't have radishes, something like cucumbers would be just as good I think, though the radishes give a pretty red color.

I made this for Valentines day. The first batch of crepes I used this recipe, and found they were too eggy and did not hold together. I used more flour in the 2nd batch and made 4 crepes. I also doubled the creamcheese mixture. I used capers and they added a great flavor. Although fairly filling, if you are serving a samaller dinner then one crepe (4 pieces)per person is perfect.

I made this for a cocktail party I was helping my daughter with. I made 6 times the recipe, and cut the crepes into 8-1 inch pieces. We had a few pieces left over the next day, and they tasted just as good. Maybe better, because the salmon and the cream cheese had a chance to blend their flavors together. I will make them again for a garden party for 200 that I am helping with in May. The green showing in the crepe and the smoked salmon might even do well for an appetizer for St Patrick's day.

It was a happy party in my mouth.I'm always looking for ways to in prove my crepes and the taste was wonderful!

I made it once following the recipe exactly as listed but found that the crepes were runny and falling apart. I used my own crepe recipe (2 c. flour, 2 c. milk, 2 eggs- lightly beaten) and added the suggested herbs and those crepes were much better. I also added thinly sliced onions on top of the salmon and garnished with chives. It was a big hit!

My husband and I thought these were great. I substituted a black pepper goat cheese for the cream cheese for a little more flavor (per other reviews). My farmers' market didn't have radishes, so I did without. I also doubled the recipe and served half one day and the other half the next day. Didn't seem to suffer from being fully assembled 24 hours in advance. Will definitely make these again.

Presentation was great and the flavours were subtle - but nice. We really liked the crunch that the radish added!

This is a quick and simple way to wow guests. The crepes turned out great and can easily be made hours ahead and stored at room temp. I pepped up the salmon mixture with some worcestershire (about five shakes) and horserashish to taste. I can't wait to try variations with the filling as the crepes turned out perfect! Next time I will triple the recipe...some guests didn't even get to try any.

The crepes were good but need a kick of something. Next time I will make the following changes: (i) reduce the amount of lemon in the cream cheese spread and (ii) add a litte thinly sliced onions over the nova before rolling the crepes.

Delicious. I did not modify the recipe other than doubling it, and made this for New Year's Day brunch; rave reviews.

An excellent recipe that should be tripled to make it worth the effort.

I made this to use on Christmas. I made the crepes and filling the day before (I tripled the recipe). I used three of the crepes and froze the rest. It was easy to do and very pretty. My guests loved them. I plan to use the leftover crepes on New Years Eve. I may try to vary the radish, maybe with some cranberry relish.

I gave this 3 forks because it seems a bit silly to make just two crepes. As a russian (in our version it's blini)I say if you went through the trouble of making the batter, make the whole stack you can alwayz freeze extras. I am sorry but I did not make it though proportions sound correct, but I would at least tripple the amount. To make fluffier crepes, add a bit mineral water to the batter before making the crepes.
