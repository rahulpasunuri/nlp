Delicious! I wasn't able to find Jicama and it was still very tasty without. I'm sure the added crunch would make it even better.

I only made the salsa, to go with another recipe here (Swordfish Verde) and it was fabulous! 1 Serrano gave it more than enough heat. Fresh and delicious with fish!

Light, bright great summer dish.

One-note flavors, but great textures. I really liked the crunch of the grilled tortilla and the jicama, but the fish, zucchini and salsa were bland overall. Next time I'll use maybe cucumber instead of the jicama, and add a lime-garlic creme.

I wouldn't say this was quick and easy. (I was looking for an easy recipe) All the chopping and grilling. Too much for a hot summer night. Kind of one note flavor wise. I'd make it again, but not put the chili oil on the zuccini and maybe marinate the fish in garlic, oil & lime and maybe add a lowfat yogurt/garlic/cilantro/lime sauce.
