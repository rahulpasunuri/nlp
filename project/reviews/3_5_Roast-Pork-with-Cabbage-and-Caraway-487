The roast was merely adequate. The cabbage was soggy and tasted overcooked.

I made this Roast. I used a peper corn Pork Tenderloin. The spices were wonderful. I used the recipe but first in a frying pan with the olive oil, I cooked the carrots, onion, bay leaves and cabbage. I fried the tenderloin about 4 min. on each side. I covered the casserole after placing the vegetables and tenderloin in the dish. It was done in the 45 min. I baked a yam for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Took out the yam. Mashed it and added some butter and 2 T. brown sugar. Baked it again with the tenderloin in the oven. for the 45 min. Wonderful dinner. Left overs for sandwiches for lunch.

What a treat ... Easy to prepare with outstanding taste.

This is very good. I used a different cut of pork because I'm not a big fan of loin. The pork was delicious. as for the cabbage, it was good, it needed more sugar and salt. I also added a touch of cider vinegar. Served with german potato salad from this site. YUM!

This came out pretty good. I made a few changes: added apple slices and used some cider for some of the beer, and did not saute cabbage as much as indicated in the recipe since we like some crunch rather than soggy.

Made this last night. It was wonderful. Pork was so tender, cabbage and onions cooked down with the juices and caraway seeds to go over mashed potatoes. True comfort food.

I used red cabbage. Ground the caraway seeds a bit, took 1:15 to reach 130 but seemed like it needed more so I cooked it another 15 minutes. I really like the results, plenty of left over veggies for lunch. If you don't like sweet flavors with pork you will not care for this one. I thought the molasses was super.

Tasty! I didn't have a way to grind the caraway seeds, so I used them whole and the flavor came through nicely. The leftover slaw was great later with hot open-faced sandwiches with pastrami or corned beef & swiss.

Very disappointing, particularly after the very favorable reviews. I had fresh cabbage & carrots just picked from our garden. The beer/molasses just overwhelmed the flavor of the vegetables - I could just as easily have been using way overaged stuff from the store (but even then I wouldn't have liked it much). My husband didn't rave about it, but thought it better than I did.

This is a very tasty and fairly easy dish. I found the recipe the night I wanted to serve it, so I did not do the overnight spice rub on the pork. I did grind fresh caraway seeds and put an extra tsp in the vegetables. It took my 3 pound roast about an hour to get to 140. A lovely combo of rich flavors.

The flavors were delicious, but my pork loin turned out tough and I only cooked it an hour. I checked twice and altho the temperature of the meat was correct when I removed it, the meat was tough and dry. Not sure what went wrong, altho the veg's were delicious.

Delicious and comforting. The beer and molasses give the sauce a wonderful bittersweet note.

No bad, but not great. Rather, not great enough to make again. I'll use my pork "allotment" on some other--better--recipe.

I used the coffee grinder for the caraway seeds, which made them easy to handle. The 24-hr. marinade pays off beautifully as this dish has a very rich, unique flavor. I used a 3-lb. pork tenderloin and only cooked it 50 mins., which seemed perfect. The shredded cole slaw was also a great time safing tip. My husband and I loved this dish.

I served this dish for the first time this past Christmas. Everyone loved it! I used a pork tenderloin and the prepackaged cole slaw mix; had problems with the caraway seeds, but I'll use my coffee grinder next time. Had leftovers which freeze beautifully. It was just as good the second time around! This recipe's a definite keeper!

This Dish was Wonderful! I couldn't help myself, I did had B size potatoes.

I substitute pork tenderloin which makes this an easy weeknight meal. I have also used a bag of shredded coleslaw mix instead of chopping the carrot and cabbage. I use my coffee grinder to crush the caraway seeds -- the seeds give this dish its flavor.

too much work for so so flavor

Very tasteful. Since I made it for only two persons I just used a couple of thick-cut pork chops, which worked out excellent. We really liked the fragrant flavour of the caraway seeds. I also substituted sauerkraut for the green cabbage to give it a sort of German twist, and I used 2 cups of Gewurztraminer instead of the beer. A keeper!

Yummy, and pretty easy too. The gravy is delicious! I used a few more carrots and some parsnips. I think the only way you could go wrong with this recipe would be if you overcooked the pork.

I actually use sauerkraut and the beer and a few apples everyone loves this...great recipe even though not followed exactly

Rating: 4
Delightful! Scrumptious! I served this with mashed potatoes. I made one change to the recipe: After boiling the cooking juices for 5 minutes, I thickened it with some cornstarch, dissolved in cold water. That made the most delicious gravy ever! Served the gravy over the pork & also over the mashed potatoes. Praises from the whole family!

Wonderful. I doubled it and used a Pork Loin that was probably larger than called for. Vegetables were done a little more than I wished because I had to cook it longer but no one cared!

This was incredible. I especially loved the veggies...I went back for more. I used pork loin top loin chops, thick cut. Really, really good.

Used 3 pounds of pork chops and at 50 minutes they baked up just fine. Also subbed maple syrup for half the molasses as I just had the dark molasses available and the wife isn't supposed to eat sugar except for maple syrup. Delicious!

Great just the way it is. I didn't change anything and everyone liked it,even my wife who hates caraway seeds.

Everyone loved it. However I used half of Costco unmarinated vacum packed pork roast. Don't know how much it weighed and all the cabbage it called for in the receipe and I was overloaded with delicious cabbage. The meat was extremely tender.Great receipe. I definitely would make it again.

This recipe has become a regular in my house. I serve it to company on a cold winter night with the warm potato onion gratin and it's a big hit. There are never any leftovers.

I used a spice grinder/coffee mill to grind the caraway seeds, cloves and whole peppercorns. Watch it though: too fine a grind and the flavors are a bit stronger than you may like, particularly the cloves.

I used an inexpensive shoulder picnic roast and cooked it at 300 degrees for a longer time.

This was very tasty, but we thought the caraway was a little strong. would tone it down the next time.

I've made this a couple times now and it just can't be beat. I usually coat the pork loin in coarse ground mustard the night before. It's a keeper!

Fantastic for this fall season. Served with thin gravy made from drippings and mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. Will definitly make again, only problem was grinding those little caraway seeds, any suggestions????

Outrageously good and pretty simple to prepare. This will be one of our regular items! I also prepare lunches for some neighbors to take to work...and it made GREAT sandwiches. They all raved!

Definitely a keeper. Was worried the caraway might be too dominant but just added a wonderful under flavor. My husband can't wait for me to make it again!
