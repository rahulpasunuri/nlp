I thought this cake was excellent - moist and delicious. It is a bit small for my family of five, expecially considering that I already ate up 1/4 of the cake within a couple of hours of making it. Next time I would increase the recipe.

This was delicious! It was very moist for a "sponge" type cake. I served it with a berry compote and everyone loved it. Just a note - When using a regular size bundt cake pan only make 1 1/2 times the recipe. Doubling the recipe will make it rise too high. It will be too top heavy so the cake will split when baking.

Outstanding. Was a huge hit. Nearly gone when we left the party. Zesting that amt. was a pain but worth it. The syrup is imperative & lovely.

This cake came out perfect, the taste was outstanding had a lot of flavour to it, however i would not use a bundt pan again for this cake, i had a hard time getting the cake out of the pan and the cake did not rise to the top of pan as indicated in recipe(maybe my bundt pan was too big)apart from that everyone enjoyed it. This was my first time making a chiffon cake!!!

very easy to make cake, so i'd make again (I had 1.5 hours to get refreshments ready for an event, and this cake did the trick)...but know that the cake is very dry. the citrus syrup is a MUST with this cake! i'm not sure how to remedy the dryness in the recipe itself.

This is an easy recipe but on the whole I found the cake too dry. A recipe from another cooking magazine which uses considerably less flour is moister and more flovorful.

I doubled the recipe and tripled the zest. I cut out about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the sugar and it was just about right. The sauce is great - I served it with berries and whipped cream. Very good - not out of this world but it was worth it.

The texture of this cake was perfect, not at all rubbery, like some chiffon cakes. It was lacking in flavor, though; if I make it again, I would double or even triple the zest. The sauce was flavorful, but the cake still would benefit from this.

Very light, excellent texture. The size is perfect for four servings. Pour the citrus sauce on the individual plates then place cake slices on top. Yummy!

I understand that the size of the pan does matter. I will be making this cake again in a couple of weeks and I will double the recipe like others have done. Otherwise the cake was wonderful. Lighter than a pound cake and the syrup was an added delight. Kinda tart so watch out.

Very good cake-I made it exactly according to the recipe, but used a 10-cup flower shaped cake pan instead (not a bundt). Baking time was about 30 minutes. It looked beautiful and everyone really liked it. Be careful: the glaze is VERY strong and can overpower the cake, which is pretty light. Vanilla ice cream took the edge off very nicely, though.

Yum! Very different and refreshing. Great for spring and summer. Everyone loved it.

This is a great cake, delicious orange flavor, light texture, and not overly rich. With only 5 tablespoons of oil, and no butter, it not too unhealthy even. It is on the small side, but I kind of liked that about--it adds to its delicacy. But if you want a larger cake, I suppose you could double the recipe.

This cake received many compliments at a recent party. It's definitely worth a try if you are looking for a light dessert. I doubled the recipe, and increased the cooking time to 60 minutes. This worked well for my bundt pan.

This is a great cake! It has a very nice texture and the flavor is wonderful. Make sure that you note the size of the bundt pan called for in the recipe-- I believe it is a smaller size than the normal bundt pan, so I doubled the recipe and the batter was just perfect to fill the pan I have.

Although this recipe was good, I didn't think it was fantastic by any means. Mine turned out just a tad on the dry side. I did, however, use a springform tube pan as someone suggested and it turned out just fine. I also increased the orange juice in the glaze and added confectioners sugar to thicken and take a bit of the tartness out (from the lemons) and just a dash of pure vanilla extract. The glaze is a MUST!

If you use a normal size bundt pan, it will be half-size (pretty cute). this is very light with a nice orange flavor, and it held up over a few days. I figured out that a small slice has only about 100 calories and very little fat, if anyone is looking for a low-fat cake.

The flavour of this cake is quite delicate. On spooning the mixture into the Bundt Pan, my mix only came up to half way of the pan and it didn't rise any either. I don't know what cake flour is so I used plain flour. I am wondering if this is the reason why the cake was not high. Next time I make this cake and I definitely will make it again, I will use an 8 inch springform pan and ice it with Orange Icing. This is a lovely afternoon tea cake. Not classy enough for a dessert.

Very good cake. Simple, easy and delicious. It's light and moist, but not oily or rich. It pairs well with fresh fruit and whipped cream for a simple, yet elegant summer dessert.

Very easy and very tasty...definitely serve it with the citrus glaze.
