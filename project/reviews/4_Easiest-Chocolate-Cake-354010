DOES ANYONE HAVE NUTRITIONAL INFO ON THIS RECIPE? I used cold coffee for the water. This is an awesome snack cake with fat free cool whip.

I had to enter my review and say this was a terrible cake with almost no chocolate flavor. If I hadn't added chocolate chips and salted peanuts to the top (for my 5 yr old) it would've been a total loss...

Amazingly quick and easy -- and very, very yummy! I made cupcakes and frosted them with a a fluffy white frosting. Topped some with colored sprinkles and some with chocolate sprinkles. Kids and adults alike loved them.

I made this for my sisters and parents and one of my sisters friends. I made this without any help really really quickly and I am only 12 years old. I think that this is a simple and delicious recipe.

I made this as cupcakes. They were very sweet and crumbly. The best part was the tops which had a crunchy texture. Baking time was 20 minutes. Next time I'll try the mashed banana/yogurt variation suggested by another reviewer. BTW I did a calorie analysis - 170 per cupcake.

I made this recipe as cupcakes with Hershey's dark cocoa and they were superb. Everyone wanted another one.

Made this exactly to recipe for cupcakes, except I didn't have any organic ingredients. They were fabulous. Very moist. Baking time was only 20 minutes.

This cake was SO good. It may have been the moistest chocolate cake I have ever eaten. And it was so flavorful and fudgy, and RICH. But not heavy at all. It was delicious! I blogged about it here- emilyspieceofcake.com/2011/08/30/zucchini-bread-easy-chocolate-cake-no-bake-cookies-and-a-hurricane/

Made this recipe again using dark cocoa for eggless muffins. Added one ripe banana and 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and reduced water by 1 cup. Included a handful of dark chocolate chips. What a deep dark moist chocolate muffin! Rave reviews from husband and kids. Will use same recipe for deliciously moist birthday cupcakes. Thank you Sarah Magid.

I used dark cocoa powder, and also added half a cup of plain yogurt and reduced the cold water by the same volume. I cannot believe that there is no egg in this dark, rich and moist cake. It reminded me of the "death by chocolate" cake that I used to order in the cafés. I will definitely use this recipe for rich and moist cupcakes. Yumm!

this recipe was great- it please a lot of non-vegan friends. however, it is really crumbly so maybe don't eat the cake over white carpet because it is a huge pain to get the crumbs out!

Easy to make. I must admit they tasted better the second and third day. We go vegan for lent and this recipe is a keeper. Will be making them again tomorrow. Didn't even have to sprinkle with confectionary sugar... kids love them.

I LOVE this cake and I am not at all a cake person. I've made it multiple times for dinner parties/events/potlucks and it is always a success. I'd say it's better than any standard chocolate cake. It is very rich and very moist. I also generally put a lemon-blueberry glaze on it (a recipe I also got from this site and which is also vegan). I know it sounds weird, but trust me, it is to die for. I've fed it to many, many people and no one has yet to complain. If you're not concerned about it being vegan, you can add chocolate chunks for an added oompf. I tried carob chips once, and those didn't work out so well.

Made this cake with all non organic ingredients, and it was delicious! I certainly can't believe that this is vegan as it was very moist. As per the reviews, I ended up making cupcakes as the cupcake liners made the removal from the pan much easier. Also, I found since I made cupcakes, the cooking time is actually shorter - this could vary depending on your oven, and the size of the cupcakes, amount of batter in each muffin liner, etc. but I found that at 24 minutes my cupcakes were well done. Given how moist the recipe is, overbaking them did not pose a problem. Will definitely keep this recipe and make again!

Second attempt was perfect. Not forgetting the baking soda always helps!

This cake was, as advertised, easy to make. But I wasn't thrilled with the taste. I made cupcakes to fill for ring-dings (another recipe in her book) and they didn't bake up very high so I don't know how I could fill them. They were also very dense, not light and fluffy. Did anyone else think the texture was heavy? Did I over mix? I might try again. Thanks.

I really don't get the rave reviews this recipe is getting. Could it be that y'all have great frosting recipes and didn't taste the cake on its own? My husband even volunteered that maybe vegans just have lower expectations for chocolate cake... he was joking about the vegan stereotype but not about the bland and funky tasting cake. I found the texture just okay and the flavor was off-putting... as if I had used artificial sweetener instead of real sugar. The overall result was not tasty at all.

Awesome. I made a 9 x 13" cake, which was a little shallow for my purposes, so I made another one and made a really big, delicious layer cake with the Vanilla Buttercream frosting recipe also on Epicurious. Used regular sugar with no problems. On the contrary, it got raves. Gonna make it again as a football cake for the Super Bowl.

Used regular sugar. Was as easy as it was described. Very moist and chocolatey. Just topped with freshly whipped cream, cocoa and icing sugar for a nice light overall result. Yum!

I've made this half a dozen times now. I love this cake! My husband and housemate request it often. I make it in a 9x13 cake pan, which requires 40 minutes of bake time in my oven. I frost with Nutella frosting: 1/2 jar of Nutella, 3/4 stick of butter, 2-3 cups powdered sugar and 1-2 tablespoons of milk or half and half. The combo is to die for!

Perfect! Easy,moist and delicious cupcakes. I added about 1 TBSP espresso powder. Frosted with simple chocolate/cream cheese frosting, and they were so good. Will definitely make these again soon.

Wow. I wouldn't have believed that this would work if I hadn't read all the reviews beforehand. How does this all hold together? kjho1 is right, it is EXTREMELY moist and has a strong, dark-chocolatey taste, making this perfect for cupcakes. The best part is that they don't dry out, either. They just stay beautifully moist, even if accidentally left out uncovered over night (oops.) I made a simple, cream cheese frosting to them and added some cinammon and hazelnuts, making them wonderfully wintery. perfect considering that it's already snowing here!

Nice and moist, but a bit too moist for my liking for layer cake material. I think it would make better cupcakes. Certainly chocolately enough, though. Baked up very nicely and super easy to put together.

Simple, fast. Not too heavy. was short on cocoa so I only used 2/3 a cup. It was still quite chocolatey.

Rating: 4
These cupcakes were indeed super easy! Better yet, they were super delicious! I frosted them simply -- 3/4 C sour cream and 1 1/2 C chocolate chips slowly melted together, then let frosting sit on cupcakes for about an hour to set. (Please note, this renders them un-vegan.) Just wonderful! These will show up at future birthday parties for sure!

Just like the recipe name says Easiest Chocolate cake. It tastes delicious, too. Definitely a keeper.

Wow! I was amazed that this cake would bake properly without the eggs....but it totally did! This is perfect for a non dairy vegan cake. It was moist and rose perfectly.
