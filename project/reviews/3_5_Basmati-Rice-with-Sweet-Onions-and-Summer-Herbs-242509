This a fantastic, simple, delicious recipe. It cooked up with perfectly cooked and separated grains and was a hit an outdoor dinner party paired with honey-gingered pork tenderloins and grilled veggies tossed with a splash of balsamic vinegar. I will be putting this into regular rotation because of its' ease, flavor and flexibility to pair with many dishes by changing up the herb combination.

I really enjoyed this rice, but I didn't have fresh dill or tarragon so I substituted with dry and used 1/3 less than what it called for. I didn't have sweet onions either, just white but it still tasted great. Next time I'm going to try making it with ghee instead of butter.

Made it for a party. I liked it, though some did not as they found the herbal taste too strong.

The aroma and the powerful flavors of the dill combined with the onions makes this dish delicious! Will certainly do it again!

Absolutely delicious! This is the third time I've made it--guests always have seconds (and thirds!) and request the recipe. I follow the recipe exactly but cut the salt to 1-1 1/4 teaspoons. The tarragon and dill wonderfully complement the basmati rice. A tantalizing flavor and aroma! Rice with a fresh exotic flair. Have discovered that it tastes even better the next day, so can be made ahead for dinner parties and simply reheated. It even works as a cold/room temp rice salad for hot summer meals! We love it with grilled pork tenderloin and grilled zucchini. Would be great with salmon too. I'm tempted to try adding peas too, similar to the traditional Indian tahiri.

Excellent rice recipe. I followed this recipe to a T, using fresh dill and chives instead of the tarragon and parsley and it was amazing. I will be serving this alongside roasted lamb and grilled veggies. This will be my 'go to' rice dish from now on, as it will taste perfect with just about anything :)

This had a fresh taste and was aromatic. I made the recipe exactly as stated. If I were to make it again however, I would use chicken boullion instead of water, as my family & guests all felt it needed a little more flavor and sprinkled sat on their rice.

This is a great, simple take on Basmati rice. It has a rich, not bland, flavor and the herbs add freshness. We served it with Grilled Salmon and our guests loved it.

This was an easy and very tasty recipe. I left out the salt though, figured there was enough taste with the herbs and it was just fine.

I'm not normally a big fan of tarragon but in the recipe all the flavors blended so well together - that my husband and I went back for seconds! Loved it and will certainly do this again.

I added more herbs, low-sodium chicken stock instead of water and more butter. I made it a few hours ahead of time which I think allowed for more flavoring then reheated it with just a bit more chicken stock. It was a huge hit. Everyone went back for seconds on the rice!

I used chicken stock for the Brown Jasmine rice. Fried in Olive oil: 1 ea small yellow, red and some green peppers with 2 jalepenos. Used a lot more herbs as well. Glad I did because as the rice sat (even next day) it took on an unique taste. Added some salt to flavor and just a little lemon juice as a spritzer with the shrimp I added. Very good dish but some may not like brown rice.

I made this by direction of the hostess for a dinner club I belong to, and was absolutely delighted! I always think I don't really like white rice, but maybe it is just the ordinary kind which bores me -- this Basmati is terrific, and the onions and herbs really give it a punch!

Loved this dish - my 18-year old liked it so much she and her friend got her friend's mother to buy the ingredients to make it at their house too! Don't omit the dill - it gives it that summer herb taste.

This was ok, turned out rather dry and boring even though I added extra onions that I had carmelized in pan (without them it would have been tasteless). Won't make again-just so-so.

huge hit!!! - everyone loved it- i used the same amount of herbs with just i cup of rice and it was perfect!!

This is okay, but lacked depth of flavor in my opinion. I highly recommend using chicken or vegetable broth to give it a rounder flavor.

This was prepared by a member of my dinner club. The recipe calls for "1½ cups Basmati rice (about 10 ounces)" which she found confusing, not being familier with the concept of using weight to measure rice. In fact, she assumed that it was a mistake and should be 12 ounces because she was correlating it with a volume measurement. I realize that experienced cooks would understand this, but perhaps the recipe should say, "10 ounces in weight" to be clear. Also, be aware that the recipe does not specify "white" or "brown" Basmati. The cooking time in the recipe is correct for white Basmati, but if you are using brown Basmati, you will need to increase the time accordingly (consult package).

Very good! I didn't have tarragon, but it was still delicious. I made this for a dinner party (tripled the recipe) with the "Grilled Chicken and Shrimp Kebabs With Lemon and Garlic" on this website... great!

This was delicious. Easy, fast, light and will be a great staple with a lot of different dishes.

Thought it was yummy. I lessened the tarragon and dill slightly (about 1 tbsp). Turned out perfect, can't wait to eat the leftovers. I never knew I love basmati rice. Any suggestions of other ways to prepare?

Absolutely delicious. Very easy to make and got great reviews from my family.

Entirely too much of all of the herbs!! They were very overpowering and made it just about inedible for me (I think my guests were being nice by eating a few bites). Could try again with less, but probably won't :-(

This was delicious, but the dill was a little over-powering. Next time I'm using half the dill and more parsley.
