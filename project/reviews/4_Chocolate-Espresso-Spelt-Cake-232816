I loved this cake and it was so moist! I did make a few changes though. I replaced the butter with coconut oil, and used raw cacao powder. I also mixed the dates with the hot water in the blender so there were no lumps. Three days later and it was still just as moist as the first day!

I am looking forward to making this cake, but I do have to say that "unctuous" is not an appealing term for food.

This cake is really special. Very moist, very chocolately, and best of all, fiber that is disguised. Be sure to use fresh Medjool dates, and lightly spoon the spelt flour. Will definitely make it again, and again, and again!

This cake is fantastic. I was worried about it being too dry from other reviews, but did not have that problem. I was making it non-dairy and non-soy, so used Earth Balance buttery spread. I honestly could have eaten the entire cake in a few hours... It did not keep too well - on the third day it had dried out.

Great basic recipe. I made it a bit healthier: I substituted the butter with 3/4 sunflower oil. I used 1/2 cup coconut sugar and 1/2 cup agave nectar instead of brown sugar. I also added 1/4 cup of apple sauce hoping to moisten it. Seems to have turned out well!

I made this cake for a friend of mine who's allergic to all dairy and white flour. I read the previews and decided I wasn't going to take a chance on a dry cake. I added the hot water over the dates by themselves and let them cool about 5 minutes and then I continued to add the rest of the ingredients plus a 1/4 Cup of oil (Vegi). That's what took the cake over the top. By the way, my friend had not had her own birthday cake in 15 years.

This was very, very dry, even when I adjusted the temperature and the time as suggested by others here. Having said that, it has an amazing taste for a cake made with only cocoa. I also put nuts in mine.

I used goat butter & 1/2 tsp cinnamon instead of the expresso powder. Also used a 10 " springform pan and baked for 42 min. This is the best wheat free cake I have ever tasted and was a very big hit with all tasters.

I have made this cake many times. I have a wheat allergy so this is perfect for me. I cut it into serving pieces and freeze them.

I love this cake! I baked it in a tube pan so it took less time. The third time I made it I ran out of dates so I threw in some dried cherries. And with coffee ice cream....

Definitely not your traditional chocolate cake, but it is perfect for those who prefer a healthier, less rich cake. Keep an eye on the cooking time, my cake came out a bit dry despite following the directions exactly.

We're on a restricted diet so spelt was just the thing for us -- and we love chocolate. Next time, I will add more butter -- this was VERY dry which made it a bit hard to eat. Aside from that, it was delicious -- even my extremely picky 8 year old who needs things SWEET! loved it -- it was just the thing for DH's birthday.

Many sugars are processed with bone char to bleach them(even brown sugars), and that makes them not vegan. I just usually check the label for those that specifically say vegan.

Chocolatey but not too sweet. I like. I used half spelt half unbleached all purpose white. I like the little bit of toothsomeness that the date provides. Its a bit too crumbly though.

Oh..my..gosh! This is amazing. Made it for a friend with wheat allergy, and everyone loved it including my kids who "hate" dates. Amazing texture.

Being allergic to wheat I only use spelt, brown rice, barley and kamut flours and always am on the look out for good dessert recipes. This is certainly one that I will keep. No one discerned the dates, which added a nice texture. I baked it 45 minutes and it was perfect. Happy to read that it converts well to VEGAN as my children are Vegan and I will make this for them next week. Not all recipes accept egg replacer well. But what is not Vegan about brown sugar?

I made this recipe for my son who cannot eat regular flour. All I hear now is 'cake? cake? cake?" Well it is a hit. It isn't too sweet but has a rich taste to it. I think the dates add I nice texture. I made some poached pears to eat with it and it was a great combination.

I subsitute all vegan ingredients (egg replacer, vegan margarine, and raw cane sugar) for the egg, butter and brown sugar. This has become my absolute favorite chocolate cake! The dates give it a nice chewy texture. It does seem to dry out within a day of baking - but that could be because I live above 5,000 ft. I also poke hole all over the top of the finished cake, pour berry juice over, then top with fresh berries. Outstanding. Guests rave about this cake - and can't believe that it's a vegan version.

This cake was rich and decadent, yet light! The spelt makes quite a difference and my family couldn't believe I didn't need any sugar to make such a delicious cake. We couldn't taste the espresso, so if you're making this cake especially for that hint of flavor, I'd up the measurement. I also preferred it with whipped cream for an extra bit of sweetness.

How nice to find a cake recipe with spelt, and chocolate to boot. We've taken to eating spelt bread for breakfast and love the taste. This cake has a lovely texture, not too sweet, but still rich tasting.

If you have never used spelt flour or tried something that was made from spelt flour, I would recommend using half spelt and half white flour. I used the white spelt flour and the cake came out moist and delicious. I love spelt flour, not only is it healthier for you than white but it is easier for your system to digest because it does not give you that bulky feeling of white or semolina flour or that bloated feeling when you substitute your recipes with wheat. Spelt comes in completely whole grain or white, you can find pasta noodles and bread in both varieties. I use spelt whenever I can. I use the white spelt bread for my sandwiches and the spelt noodles for everything from baked Macaroni and Cheese to Italian pasta dishes. When I feel like having pizza, I use frozen spelt pizza shells. You can find spelt products at any Whole Foods Supermmarket. Spelt is a wonderful grain!

Why did the first two cooks rate it one star when they made no claims as to WHY they didn't like it? That throws the rating system off, so I'll just bump it back up to 4 forks BECAUSE it uses a healthier type of flour. I agree with the cook from LA that it would be richer with more chocolate, but I'd use melted bitter chocolate instead of cocoa powder any day. Best yet, use Scharffenberger and go all OUT!!!!

aCCORDING TO THE FOOD DICTIONARY ON THIS SITE, spelt FLOUR IS Native to southern Europe, where it's been used for millenniums, spelt is an ancient CEREAL GRAIN that has a mellow nutty flavor. The easily digestible spelt has a slightly higher protein content than WHEAT and can be tolerated by those with wheat allergies. Spelt flour, available in health-food stores, can be substituted for wheat flour in baked goods

Spelt is an ancient grain. I've heard that it derives from wheat and is usually substituted for wheat flour in recipes. I find spelt flour at the health food store in whole and sifted varieties. You can have very good luck exchanging it for white flour in recipes. For starters though, I would only substitute half the white flour (or less) for spelt and see how you like the flavor and texture.

What's spelt flour? I've never heard of it.

I kept waiting for someone else to rate this recipe, so I could see if it was worth venturing out for spelt flour, but finally I broke down and tried it. Only so so. For folks who can't tolerate normal flour, or who are really into whole grains and such, it's fine, but it's not quite up to the level of decadence I expect from a chocolate cake. Maybe if you covered it in ganache it'd be more satisfying. But then again, everything is more satisfying if it's covered in ganache....
