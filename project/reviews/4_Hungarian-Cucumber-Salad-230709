This is pretty close to authentic Hungarian, only thing I would do different is, instead of garlic powder, use crushed fresh garlic

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving, a light and refreshing break from heavier fare. Adjust sugar to taste; I used about 1 teaspoon. I'll definitely make it again, it's very tasty and so simple!

Made this as written for a cookout with cucumbers from the garden. Everyone loved it. It's refreshing without the vinegar being too overpowering. Not my favorite cucumber salad, but a crowd-pleaser.

This recipe is not true Hungarian style. Sour Cream and a bit of vinegar and grated onion is the Hungarian style dressing for cucumbers.

I make this recipe whenever possible and even the pickiest of guests raves about it for days after. I often add tomatoes as a delicious variation.

in my quest to learn more of E. EU cusine, I was happy to see this recipe. I'm sure it's simillar to the several versions I had at family gathers during recent trip to Hungary and Romania. I know my Host's family never used garlic but always sweet sliced onion and think the amount of sugar was increased slightly. I noticed they all enjoyed the vinegar dressing as much as the salad itself. This is a lovely, palate-cleansing salad and pairs wonderfully with grilled meat.

My Mom and I have used this recipe since my Hungarian Grandmother taught it to her when I was an infant! It's amazing. Perfect in the summer when you're BBQ'ing and need a cool, clean dish! If you've got a garden, even better! Sometimes, Mom will put a little red onion in; sometimes a little fresh CA tomato! Mouth watering!

Better than my Hungarian grandma used to make. Served it to an international crowd who devoured it happily. The Swedes claimed it was as much Swedish style as Hungarian, and the Latin Americans simply loved it.
