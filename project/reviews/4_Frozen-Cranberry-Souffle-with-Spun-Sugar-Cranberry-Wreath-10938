This is lovely - but I'd like to taste more cranberry. Next time, I'd reduce the cream to 2 cups, or increase the cranberries, or both.

I've made this several times, always to rave reviews. If you have a candy thermometer the spun sugar wreath is very easy and can be done in 15 minutes. It adds so much to the presentation. The wreath and a glass bowl are essential.

I made this recipe for Christmas some years ago and just loved it. I rated it four forks because it is great to have a light holiday dessert that looks just as spectacular as the heavier sweets. I did the wreath. It wasn't that difficult, and it added a certain something.

This tasted better before I froze it. After freezing, the flavor became very bland. I was somewhat dissapointed with this recipe as reviews reported it so well. I made it for thanksgiving, and I ended up throwing away over half the dessert (wasnt worth the calories). Perhaps you're supposed to allow it to thaw halfway before serving??

Looks better than it tastes. I wouldn't make it again.

I had this recipe years ago, but the magazine it was in was lost when I moved. I am very happy to have it back. It makes a great alternative to pies or other heavy deserts.

I made this for the first time for Christmas this year..and it was the star of the buffet! It was not difficult to make and was not only beautiful, but delicious as well.

I made this for Christmas in 1992 and a couple of times after that.My guests' comments were most rewarding. I haven't made the wreath yet--maybe this year. It's a splashy, impressive dessert (I froze it in a pretty 8-in diam. glass ice bucket) and it tastes marvelous!

I have made this every year at holiday time since 1992, and usually more than once! It's great for parties, potlucks, family gatherings. It's beautiful on a holiday buffet and absolutely delicious. While it is not low calorie, it has a light feel to it. And it's easier to make than it looks--I usually skip the spun sugar wreath and it's still pretty.
