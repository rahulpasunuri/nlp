I made these for Saint Patty's Day and they were amazing! Possibly the best thing I've ever baked, and that's saying something. Before I made them, the reviews made me nervous, but I did nothing special (other than using peppermint flavor instead of regular mint)and they came out flawless. Easy but fancy and beautiful to look at. An A+!

These were incredible! I brought them to a Christmas party and they were a huge hit.

I have made these several times to rave reviews. I agree that the ganache is mandatory! I also added 2 squares of melted/cooled unsweetened chocolate to the batter. I used shortening and refrigerated the dough for 1 hour and didn't have an issue with spreading. I used a level cookie scoopful and baked 8 minutes max. They are as delightful as a cupcake without having to peel/toss the wrapper!

I also stopped after making the cookies - they spread and just didn't hold up. I used the recipe as written and am an experienced baker.

My cookies spread more than expected, but I probably creamed the butter too long. Tasted great. Agree with other reviewers that more ganache is needed. And much less sugar in the cream filling. Over two cups sounded way too much and I only used one and a half cups and it still seemed way too sweet (for our tastes at least). Would definitely make them again though!

These cookies are good. I used butter instead of shortening and made 21 (whole) coookies instead of 15. I don't know if one of these reasons was why my cookies only baked to 1/2 thick. I'm making more tonight (for St. Patty's day) so I think I'll stick with the butter and double the cookie size. Hopefully it will work!

I am an experience baker (pro for many years) and love to bake! This was a HUGH hit at work..fighting-over-the-last-one kind of good. I am now working on savory flavors and fillings. Whoopie Pies are the new "cupcake"!

I also used butter for both and these were delicious. Made them exactly as recipe called and mine spread beautifully. The recipe makes a lot of cookies. I also would double the ganache next time. My husband raved about them.

i stopped right at the cookie, didn't even try the filling. used frosting once i saw wasn't worth completing recipe. once i pulled the cookies out of the oven, i saw that they didn't spread. plus, they were dry and crumbled like no one's business. granted, i used gf flour, but i have subbed gf flour for every regular baking recipe i have and it has never been a problem. these cookies/cakes need to have a thinner batter.

In the Steeler Nation, we call these "gobs" not "whoopie pies." It's time everyone knew that.

I made these for a party and they were a hit! I used half shortening/half butter for the filling and was very happy with the consistency and taste. I think you need some shortening for the filling to hold its shape better (and melting point is higher). Overall, great recipe - but definitely time consuming!

Yum. I used butter and thought the taste was wonderful. Might try shortening next time for the cookies, to make them a little firmer. I made them a little smaller than called for. Might make more ganache next time and use on both sides of cookie. Would make a great Christmas cookie exchange.

I thought these were delicious and easy too - I made the cookies with butter and the filling with shortening, but I think I would use butter for both next time, I personally don't like the shortening taste - I also might try to make them smaller next time- a yummy, light & minty treat!

Easy and delicious. The kids enjoyed every bite of the mint filling. One of my staples for the Holidays from now on.
