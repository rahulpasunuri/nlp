I agree completely with vaguy from Richmond, VA. For years this was a wonderful menu item at The Trellis in Williamsburg. Absolutely no need to modify a thing. Unfortunately the new owners have removed this favorite from the menu, as I discovered this past weekend. At least I can make my own!

This dish was a big hit as the the centerpiece for a winter baby shower. I chopped chives for a little color, and needed twice as much melted butter to get the cracker crumbs and cheese to hold together for the crust. It is a terribly rich dish: next time I'll make half as much, (doubling the ham) and make it in a tart pan for a "skinniner" pie. It was just too rich for most people to finish, which led to a lot of waste. It is absolutley scrumptious, though, and I will make it again with these modifications.

We added about 1TBS of Coleman's dry mustard and served this with fig Compote (you can find the recipe on Epicurious) and it was fantastic. We were guests at new friends' hose and didn't know their tastes so this was a SAFE thing to take - even the kdis liked it.

I made this cheesecake a couple years ago and again yesterday. It has a wonderful presentation and serves a lot of people. I use way less of the reserved crust on top. I also used Dubliner cheese instead of Swiss. People are always impressed and love it.

I love this dish. I've made this twice now, the second time I made two cakes for a large Mother's Day brunch buffet. Got many compliments and every crumb was devoured! I think the recipe has a lot of potential for variations. High quality cheese is important, don't try low fat cream cheese. I substituted Gruyere for the Swiss and to improve the texture of the crust (the grated parmesan turns into crunchy straw when baked) I used the powdered form of parmesan- a big improvement. Not cheap to make, but it's rich and a little slice goes a long way.

The crust and topping were very "gritty." And yes, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect......it is just a strange texture for ham and eggs. I felt like I was eating a cheesecake that should have been sweet.

I served this to a large group, many of whom have plain taste. Thus, I substituted a less strong baked ham instead of country ham. That might account for its lack of pizazz. The reviewers who added sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms probably are right. The main problem was a moist crust despite my wrapping the springform pan in double foil for the water bath I always use for cheesecakes. Next time I'll try putting the springform (a 7" for 1/2 recipe) inside a silicone round pan and putting those in the water bath. Also plain saltine grind just as well as the more expensive oyster crackers. The presentation was lovely with the cheesecake surrounded with fresh herbs served on a footed cake plate. Its showiness will not dissuade me from believing the best appetizer on this site is the sun-dried tomato pesto torta. So I gave this one 3 forks.

Every time I go to the Trellis for lunch, I order this cheesecake. It is one of those wonderful dishes that you can unreservedly recommend to people. The recipe is easy to follow, and I cannot disagree more with the few people who have panned it--if you read the negative reviews, you will find that, most often, the reviewers modified the recipe. I fail to understand people who criticize a recipe that they did not follow. For those who had difficulty making this cheesecake, they either had a bad kitchen day or they simply are not very skilled in the kitchen.

Outstanding! I cut the recipe in half and cooked this for dinner one Sunday evening simply because we had a massive amount of cream cheese-type spread on hand and this recipe fit the bill. My boyfriend and I were both impressed. It's easy enough to prepare that I would definitely make it again for a regular meal or a dinner party. And it seems like nearly any type of meat and/or vegetable would meld nicely with the savory cheeses. A good side dish for this is a simple steamed vegetable to balance the very savory flavors of this "cheesecake". Very versatile and delicious!!

Excellent. Despite the mixed reviews my guests and I all enjoyed this savory cheesecake. I served it as a side dish with Thanksgiving dinner and then again for breakfast the next morning. We all loved it. I used two generous cups of Swiss cheese and probably about 1 1/2 cups of smoked ham.

I've made this cheesecake several times and it's always a hit. I've used smoked turkey, mushrooms and pinenuts. I fell in love with this at the Trellis and am delighted to be able to make it.

this was absolutely delish!!!we recently made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It was a bit too rich though, the crust, a little too crumbly, but overall fantastic!!! Definately a keeper.

haven't made this yet, but intend to for the Belmont Stakes Party. I think if one would call it a 'torte' it will give it the European edge. My grandfather (italian used to make something similar for Easter, athough it included provolone and sausage! We called it Easter pizza, otherwise known as Pizza Rustica)

Tried it again, this time substituting sundried tomatoes and fresh mushrooms for ham (for the not-so-ham-friendly in our family). Also, to quiet the rich flavors, used a bit less parm cheese and reduced fat cream cheese. This left room to go back for seconds, which everyone promptly did!

I made this last year for the family Thanksgiving feast. I was going to make something else this year, but my husband pouted about it. I am glad I found the recipe again on line. It was terrific, but it should be served in small portions. It's a big cake and very rich. We love it and you can make lots of variations on the cheeses and/or herbs. Use a cookie cutter and cut out a ham pig to put on top. That should show people it's a savory cheesecake!

I made this originally for a brunch, and it was well-received. I recently made adjusted it using proscuitto, provolone, spinach and asiago cheese, with a little garlic and rosemary. Also great. I think this is a good starter for an appetizer cheesecake.....

I substituted the reduced-fat version for half the cream cheese in the recipe (2 pounds!); used fresh cheese and the round type of crackers, which made a good crust; and freshly-baked ham from a good market. The cheesecake looked great, and made a nice presentation at the afternoon event where it was served. But nobody could manage more than a tiny sliver-it is just too rich. I thought it was "heavy" even for a cheesecake. I won't make it again.

A lot of work and expense for not a lot of flavor. I was disappointed after the great reviews. The crumb and parmesan crust had great flavor but it was too crumbly and hard to press into the pan. I ended up adding extra butter. I think it needs a stronger cheese, more ham (I used Black Forest) and definitely more chives and pepper. I served this to a Wine Tasting group of 30 and about 1/3-1/2 was eaten. There were comments but no raves and no one asked for the recipe.

Made this for a very large, all appetizer Christmas party. Very few people ate it, though the flavor was good. Someone remarked that perhaps more people would be eating it if it was called something different; "HAM CHEESECAKE?" It was a marketing thing, I suppose. Emeril's Lobster Cheesecake (same idea as this one) was nearly gone before this one had two slices taken out. If I go to the trouble again, I'll do Emeril's instead...

Served this on New Year's Eve and it was a great hit. Used country ham (instead of regular ham). Don't substitute "lite" cream cheese and make sure you serve it at room temperature. Like all cheesecakes, it taste better a day or two later, after it has had a chance to "ripen."

I made this for a Xmas luncheon and served it as a main course. It was wonderful! I added a 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes, drained from oil and chopped. I also increased white pepper to 1 t. and added 1 t. nutmeg. I made it the day before. Put crust in pan, covered and chilled. Made filling, covered and chilled. Let filling come to room temp. before pouring in pan. Baked 2 hrs. and 15 mins. I served warm with the mixed green salad with oranges and dried cranberries. It was just delicious! This is a keeper!

Lovely. I had to hunt for the soup and oyster crackers, too, and when I finally did find them, I looked at the package and saw that they had a "Use before Oct. 2000" sign on them. I was NOT going back to the store, so I used them anyway. This cheesecake was still great, even with a slightly stale crust! Quite expensive to make, however, but it did feed a crowd. I served it at a Christmas Day brunch. (lupper? linner?) The filling looks like it'll overflow, because it makes so much, but don't worry. It really sets up nicely, and looked perfect. Mine baked for 2 hours and about 10 minutes. Great, great dish. Use a good quality ham, and the best parmesan you can afford.

I am looking forward to serving this for Christmas brunch. In response to the question on small saltines, here on the East Coast they go under the brand name Oysterettes. Hope that helps.

I'd like to try this for a Christmas Day brunch, but can anyone tell me what soup and oyster crackers are? I know they say it's small saltines, so can I just use regular sized saltines? Are the soup and oyster crackers flavored differently than regular salitines???

I made this dish as an appetizer for a Christmas party and it was a hit. Doing it in a springform pan really makes it look like it was professionally done. Next time I am going to try it with twice the amount of ham.
