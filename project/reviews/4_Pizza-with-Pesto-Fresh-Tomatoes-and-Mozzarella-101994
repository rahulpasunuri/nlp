Excellent flavor w/the basil pesto. Only subs: mixed fresh mozzarella with fontina and italian cheese mix. Fontina is so much more creamy than moz in pizza. Plus I made fresh pizza dough using Wolfgang Puck recipe on web. This recipe is very simply and delicious. Wolfgang Puck is well known for great pizzas.

Made this tonight on the grill and it was great. I used store bought dough rolled fairly thin and added grilled chicken. Super easy and tasty...just the way I like it!

I added grilled chicken cubes, substituted grape tomato halves for the plum tomato slices and threw on some grilled summer squash. Very yummy. And I cooked it on our bbq using our pizza stone which kept me from having to turn on the oven in 100F weather :)

WOW. This was absolutely amazing. I followed the recipe except I used boxed pizza dough mix and store-bought mozzarella. Can't wait to make it again!

This pizza recipe is hard to beat, especially now that yummy dough is so easy to purchase and keep in he freezer. A few variations- I try to use wheat dough and roll it as thin as possibile. Sun Dried tomatoes in oil are a great sub when summer tomatoes are no longer available. Pine nuts sprinkled on top is a delicious addition and sometimes I'll add pre browned chicken sausage if I feel like some meat.

I was searching this site for another fresh tomato recipe to use up our garden tomatoes. This popped up and we tried it using fresh pizza dough from Trader Joes. It was fabulous and so easy. I have always used corn meal on my peel for ease in transferring to the pizza stone. Works very well. Will be making this one again.

I used Boboli for crust and it turned out so well. I love this recipe and will make it again.

This is a great, easy idea for pizza (which is a weeknight staple at our house using pizza dough from the bakery down the street). We used homemade pesto (frozen from the summer's basil bounty), homegrown tomatoes, and regular mozzarella instead of fresh. A slice of summer!

great pizza, and we are very fussy about meatless meals in our home. i used roma tomatoes which tend to be less watery and more robust flavoured. also home made crust is a must.

Very, very simple. I made this with store bought dough and pesto and regular shredded mozzarella. Very tasty.

Really yummy! To the cook whose pizza was watery - the culprit was the fresh mozzarella. If you use fresh, you'll have to put it in a sieve or mesh bowl and weight it with something to press out the water. An easier option is to just use a high-quality whole milk mozz from the cheese section. DON'T use pre-shredded as that is treated with cellulose to keep it from clumping up and makes the cheese dry out.

This is a fabulous quick meal! Great, fresh taste with a gourmet flare. We used a "Boboli" crust to speed up the prep time and added a little fresh goat cheese and ricotta as well. This has become a favorite stand-by in my house!

The flavor of this recipe was very good. However, I had a problem with it being watery. I assume that it was from the water in the fresh mozzarella. I did allow my tomatoes to drain on a paper towel after I cut them. Does anyone have a suggestion of what I did wrong or how to prevent this from happening?

I went a little overboard with the pesto so it came out a bit oily. It still tasted ymmuy though.

I havent tried this specific recipe before but to reply to a previous cooks question regarding grilling pizza - instead of using pizza dough for a crust, you can use pitas. Make sure that you put a couple of sheets of aluminum foil on the grill and brush with oil before you put your pita pizza on. You'll want to grill on low - med heat so that all your toppings get cooked and your cheese melted.

This pizza is very fresh tasting. I used purchased Central Market-brand pesto from the condiment bar, made a simple homemade pizza crust, used home-grown tomatoes that I allowed to drain for a few minutes on paper towels, and added chopped artichoke hearts. Easy and tasty with a fresh green salad.

Fantastic dinner with a salad. Made the basic pizza dough with the suggestion to add olive oil and sugar (great improvement in my dough). I use home made pesto and fresh mazzorela. This will be a summer favorite!

Super simple. Better than I expected. I've made it 4 times, including twice for casual dinner guests, since discovering a few weeks ago. Definitely recommended. And I've made a lot of homemade pizza. PS Used The Minimalist's Crust recipe. And thanks for the tip re parchment on pizza stone - worked great.

Does anyone know how this pizza would do grilled- I am grilling pizzas for the 4th and this sounds great but will the thin crust hold up. Thank you!

We make pizza a couple times a month, and this is one we've always liked. Of course we tend to play with it; that's the fun of pizza. I don't trust myself with a pizza peel, so I prepare the pizza on parchment sprinkled with cornmeal and plop it onto the preheated stone (paper and all). The crust is still crunchy, and it cuts down on the potential for disaster.

Wonderful! And ridiculously easy. I used a store-bought refrigerated tube of pizza dough, and it was very thin and flimsy. Next time I will buy a more substantial dough. This would taste awesome with a sprinkling of fresh mushrooms. The possibilities are endless!

I was skeptical about this prior to making it. It's so simple I wondered how good it could really be. We weren't disappointed at all. In fact we couldn't stop eating it!! Rave reviews..I ended up running out for more tomato so that we could make another one. I used a premade pizza crust from a local Italian market. It was fabulous. Will make over and over.

This is our favorite Friday night meal in late summer when the basil in our garden is plentiful. We make this recipe with a few delicious twists. We make our own pesto, and we toast the pine nuts to give it a richer flavor and we usually put in a little more garlic than we otherwise would. We have tried this using yellow tomatoes for a more subtle flavor and have added very thin sliced red onion for some extra zing. Also, we have used some smoked cheese in place of half of the mozzarella, then sprinkle the top with some pecorino romano and reggiano parmesan. When we use our pizza stone (or baking sheet), we dust the bottom with corn meal to prevent sticking. Happy eating!

I took the earlier reviewers suggestion and made the Wolfgang Puck dough. I used homemade pesto (using pecans instead of pine nuts), added homegrown tomatoes from the garden, fresh mozzarella, & chopped garlic. It was absolutely delicious!!

This recipe is delicious! I bought dough at my local pizza parlor (most will sell it to you if you ask). I used homemade pesto (fresh basil leaves processed with garlic and extra virgin olive oil - avoid pignoli nuts for this recipe). Fresh mozzarella and flavorful, ripe summer tomatoes made it absolutely perfect. I cooked it on a rectangular baking sheet @ 400F. It took about 30 mins. for the crust to brown. Keep an eye on it, though, so the cheese does not get overdone. Even my daughter liked it and she is not a big pesto fan.

WOW! Absolutely delicious and easy to make- my mother loved it- I have never seen her eat so much pizza. I grated some romano over the top, as I thought simply mozzarella wasn't enough variety of cheese for my family, and it was wonderful. I also cooked it for a little longer at 450, about 15 minutes, and it still worked well. I already have many requests for a repeat!

Excellent. Even my picky eater husband enjoyed it. I added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes and chopped artichoke hearts.

About a month ago we gave up the "pizza delivary" for homemade pizza. I found a wonderful crust recipe, and we love to experiment with toppings. This is one of our favorites, but we often add black olives.

This is exactly like the pesto-tomato pizza from my favorite local pizzaria. I took someone's advice and added sauteed spinach--It was great, and an easy way to sneak in another serving of vegetables.

This is a great simple recipe. I made it with a whole wheat crust and I added pine nuts on top. Everyone loved it.

OK, I cheated. I added sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and fresh basil. It was delicious! If you don't have a peel to go with your stone (and I don't) I suggest you stretch the dough, put it on the stone, let it rest for about 10-15 mintues, then prick the dough all over with a fork, brush on the pesto, and bake for about 10 minutes before adding the rest of the toppings. Return the pizza to the oven and give it about 10 more minutes. Perfect!

What a wonderful pizza! It's very light and a very nice change from the tomato-sauce style. I left the pesto amount as is. I also sprinkled the pizza with oregano and garlic powder and made my own pizza dough (epicurious Pizza Dough - Gourmet Jan 98 - double recipe there tho unless you like very thin crust) and baked it on a stone.

Very good! I end up using fresh mozzarella, which I slice thinly rather than grate, and probably a bit more pesto (like 1/3 cup). Make sure the crust is nice and thin. Easy and very, very delicious.

I modified a few things, and my husband was flipping out over this pizza!! I sauted a 6oz bag of baby spinach then drained it REALLY well, chopped it, and mixed it with the tomatoes along with some fresh minced garlic. I also added a bit of oregano and fresh basil. Anyway, it was a huge hit. I'm looking forward to making it again.

I made this for the family on a Saturday night and they loved it. I had the benefit of using a pizza stone, so the crust was nice and crunchy. They have already requested it again!
