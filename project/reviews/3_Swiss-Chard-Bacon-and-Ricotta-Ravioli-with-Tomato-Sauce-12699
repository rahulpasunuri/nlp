I thought this was a good recipe, though next time I will try pasta instead of wonton wrappers. It still came out well, and was very easy to make.

Fab-U-lous!!!! Made these ravioli for a dinner party and they were a big hit! My boyfriend ate four servings

used fresh lasagna noodles from whole foods (trader joe's on the west coast has them too) instead of wonton wrappers and used egg white to bind. also added some goat cheese to the filling.

This was pretty good, though I think the sauce had a lot to do with that. For me, half a pound of chard turned out to be 8 cups which packed down to three. It was most likely too much, as the filling was good but not howlingly great.

This was a hit. The sauce I served with it was overpowering, though. Next time, it will be a much simpler sauce. The filling is so delicious you don't want to mask it.

The filling is delicious. What's not to like about ricotta, spinach, bacon and garlic! I think I would have given the recipe 4 forks if I had used pasta sheets instead of wonton wrappers. The wonton wrappers were easy and quick, but the texture left something to be desired - quite mushy (maybe I cooked them too long. I think I might try making this filling for canneloni or manicotti next time. PS I just used my own homemade tomato sauce...

Simple and rustic-elegant. Made for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone raved. Won ton wrappers work well and assemble quickly.

Loved the filling, but the wrappers did not work. They were too watery. I may make it again, but with purchased pasta sheets.
