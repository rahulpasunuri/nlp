This was excellent. A guest who does not like cranberry sauce at all even liked it. It is tart, but really good. Definitely a keeper.

Finally a cranberry relish I really enjoy. The apple makes all the difference. Still tart enough to counter all the rich foods of Thanksgiving, but not so tart as to only want one or two bites.

I made 1/2 recipe for 12 people and it was enough. Delicious. The allspice gave an interesting flavor to the dish and was light on sugar giving a tartness to the cranberries. Great.

This was really good & really easy, but be warned it makes a TON of relish. I'd say for 8 people, you could halve it and have the right amount.

I thought before I even started that this recipe would be too dry. I was right -- it was. I added some orange liqueur and it was fine. My cranberries were really fresh so I had to process them to small pieces. I added the sugar while processing and not at the end. I'm still tempted to cook this (but I won't).

This is super easy and absolutely wonderful. You can mix it to the consistence you like best. We like it somewhat chunky. It's a great treat in the lunchbox!!!
