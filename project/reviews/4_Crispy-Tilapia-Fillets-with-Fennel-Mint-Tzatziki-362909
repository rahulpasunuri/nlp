Very good as written.

The flavors of the tzatziki sauce are wonderful. I added celtic sea salt as well. It is even good leftover and cold. My 5-year old loved it as well. Highly recommend.

Textures were very nice. I did not include any lemon in the yogurt as suggested by some, and regretted it. There is not a lot of flavor here so DO plan to either sprinkle the fish with lemon juice or incorporate it into the tzaziki. I probably will not make this again but for those planning to make this, it's worth trying!

Excellent recipe. Finely mincing the fennel for the tzatziki is important. Took the earlier advice and added juice of half a lemon to the tzatziki (and about a half teaspoon of minced lemon zest). Also added some spice to the fish by sprinkling it with shichimi togarashi that I had on hand (a little cayenne would accomplish the same). I doubt either extra step was particularly necessary, but it was very good this way.

Tzatziki was delish! I eyeballed everything and added some dill and a squeeze of lemon. For tilapia, i used whole eggs and just did the panko and fried in olive oil.

I didn't have any fennel, but even without it the tzatziki was good, made an excellent combo with the tilapia. I also added parsley, a chopped garlic clove, red onion; used white champagne vinegar; a bit more olive oil. I like the reviewer's idea of adding lemon juice; will try.

This recipe was fantastic. I added lemon to the yogurt mix and that made it really flavorful and made the texture better. The fish was delicious with the yogurt mix. I made a couscous along with it. Great meal.

Very good. I had a hard time finding a fennel bulb, but it was worth the hunt. I agree that this type of fish can be bland, so I prepped them by sprinkling a little Emeril's Essence and a pinch of cayenne pepper on each fillet, then dusted them with flour (I used "Pan Searing Flour" I wound at a Wegmans) before the egg wash. Very tasty! This one is in my Recipe box, will make again.

I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil to fry the fish, and subsequently burned through the oil a little too quickly; tilapia filets are pretty big, so I had to fry in batches. I floured the fish prior to coating with egg white and breadcrumbs, and the result was a very crispy fish without enough flavor- more panko than fish. The sauce was magnificent, and I would make that again.

We loved this recipe. It was simple and I thought had plenty of flavor. I liked the delicate fennel flavor. We served it with a wild rice pilaf and roasted beets dressed with lemon juice, lots of fresh dill and olive oil. Yum!

You've probably made this recipe, but better before. The sauce is ok. It needs lemon and more oil and a good amount of salt. The fish is bland bland bland. I'd try adding more spices to it like cayenne or cumin or maybe even some thyme. As it is here, don't bother.

It was delicious! Only, the breadcrumbs came off when I fried the fillets, I noticed early enough to save them but next time I'll use some flour to toss the fillets in before spreading on the eggwhite. And yes, the fennel has to be chopped up very finely then the taste is just exceptional!

yum! definitely use lemon as pictured.

To 'a cook from germany'; must you proselytize? If you so object, then turn to a different cooking site - maybe Cookinglight.com would suit you. P.S. this was good...I'll make again.

However, farm raised tilapia (the least expensive and most popular) has a high fat content (though low in saturated fats). According to research published in July 2008, farm raised tilapia may be worse for the heart than eating bacon or a hamburger. The research suggests the nutritional value of farm raised tilapia may be compromised by the amount of corn included in the feed. The corn contains short chain omega-6s that contribute to the buildup of these materials in the fish. "Ratios of long-chain omega-6 to long-chain omega-3, AA to EPA respectively, in tilapia averaged about 11:1, compared to much less than 1:1 (indicating more EPA than AA) in both salmon and trout." Wide spread publicity encouraging people to eat more fish has seen tilapia being purchased by those with lower incomes who are trying to eat a well balanced diet. The lower amounts of omega-3 and the higher ratios of omega-6 compounds in US farmed tilapia raise questions of the health benefits of consuming this fish.

To 36braids...any mild white fish would do in this dish. Orange roughy, mahi mahi or cod.

This was a really good preparation for the tilapia. I recommend making the tzatziki a few hours earlier and leaving in the refrigerator for flavors to blend a bit better. It seemed to make a lot of sauce for the amount of fish, but it's really good so we'll use it for something else! I was interested to see how fennel would be in place of the traditional cucumber bits -- but if you chop them up small, as directed, it will be great.

Excellent combination of subtle fennel flavor on the tilapia with the crispy panko and creamy Tzatziki. Be sure to finely chop the fennel for the Tzatziki.

Tried this for something different. Easy way to spice up basic Tilapia. I was worried about the ground fennel seeds being too overpowering, but it wasn't -- could even use a little more. I combined this Tzatziki recipe with the June 98 Cumcumber and Tomato Tzatziki recipe, and served it with Couscous. We loved it -- cleaned the plates completely!
