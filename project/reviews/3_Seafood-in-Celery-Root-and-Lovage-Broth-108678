This was a lot of effort, but was great! I didn't have oysters, so I substituted steamed mussels and a few fresh shucked clams instead. Also, used shitakes instead of oyster mushrooms. Oysters would have been more delicate, but the shitakes added a nice flavor. I used the inner celery rather than lovage (which I couldn't find). The broth was a very complex flavor and the shellfish was great.
