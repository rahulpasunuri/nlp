This was the best brisket ever! It definitely had many steps as the other reviewers stated but it was WELL worth it. My guests could not stop raving! When we had it as leftovers the next day my husband said he felt bad for those who couldn't have it again! I couldn't find neck bones at our butcher, so I used beef short ribs instead. The meat fell off of them by the end of the cooking and added tremendous flavor as well. FABULOUS!

This is far and above the best brisket recipe ever. I have also omitted the bones and it still comes out delish. I have made this recipe many times since its debut in 1995!

I make this brisket twice yearly, or the kids won't be happy at the holidays. I make the following changes: brown the meat on both sides; use a hearty white wine; flambe after adding the brandy; frozen pearl onions, defrosted and drained well instead of sliced onion; and I don't use zucchini. Ignore your arteries and enjoy. You only live this life once!

Best brisket recipe I've found!! I did do many step-saving things to the recipe, though...I skipped the bones, only used carrots sliced & added in the last hour of cooking, skipped the section listed under Assembly & served the sauce straight from the Dutch Oven that I cooked in.

This recipe was definately very time consuming but worth it for the once or twice a year that I'll make it. Make sure that you buy a well marbled double brisket or you will end up with a piece of leather! (Learned that lesson the hard way). This meat was fork tender and the gravy was rich and flavorful. I didn't bother straining the sauce. I just threw it all into the food processor with the tomato paste. It turned out great. I also just roasted some potatoes, carrots and zucchini. The recipe was enough work without fussing with veggies. Even my 7 month old baby liked the brisket!

I found this recipe was timeconsuming and produced tough meat with very "raw" tasting gravy. I cooked the meat longer than stated in the recipe, but the meat was tough and tasteless with very unpleasant gravy. May have been the meat purchased, but no excuse for the gravy. Yuk.

On the plus side, this recipe resulted in a very tender and flavorful brisket with a delicious savory sauce. It is however, as other reviewers noted, relatively time consuming for a brisket recipe. Luckily, it does freeze well, so it lends itself to making a big batch for several meals.

Definately one of the best brisket recipes I have tried. I have served it to discerning brisket lovers and they have raved. The reciped is time consuming but the finished product delicious. Too many vegetables if serving with other side dishes. Well worth the effort and it freezes beautifully( minus the veggies)

This was my first attempt at brisket and came out surpringly well. I need to adjust my cooking time on my next try because the meat was not as tender as it should be. But, the sauce was great! I steamed all of my veggies then roasted them in the oven with the butter/honey mixture.

Ehile the gravy was very tasty, it wasn't enough to save this recipe. I've got so many better brisket recipes (and easier ones!) than this. First, I've always found that browning the roast first adds depth of flavor, just as you would want to do with any pot roast--it definitely would have helped this recipe. Second, the cooking time was way too long for your typical flat piece of brisket--I took it out a half hour early and the meat was still dried out. I ended up with more vegetables than we ever could have consumed, and the prunes ended up looking like weird sludgy muck.

It is critical that you tightly cover the pan. I've had the sauce all dry up and burn, if the pan isn't tightly covered enough.

I have used this recipe time and time again with Brisket lovers. It never fails to impress! Results are well worth the extra effort in preparation.

My guests, including one hard-core brisket afficianado, said this was the best brisket they've had; fork-tender but still moist, with a wonderful sauce (from the pureed onion mixture). It also is one of the most visually pleasant meat-and-vegetables dishes I've served, using a yellow, green, orange and white combination of baby vegies. I used a very good cut of 5-lb brisket from the butcher, and maybe a little more vegetables than recommended. When you take the brisket out of the fridge, and before you discard the bones, be sure you scrape the juices and cooked marrow off of them and into the roasting pan. I served this with a bakery-fresh loaf of dark Russian rye, and a salad of spinach, radicchio mushrooms and cashews.

I made this recipe when it was first in the magazine - I have made it at least twice a year since! It is by far the best brisket recipe ever. I have made it without the bones and it is still very good and it saves a few minutes. Everyone has raved about it at our house!

Excellent. Well worth the effort, if you have a problem with toughness, just roast it slower on a lower temp. The sauce turns out just as good, with less toughness and dryness.

The meat prepared this way, I thought was tough. However, the sauce was incredible. Next time, I will try this recipe with a better cut of meat. Try this recipe but pay close attention to the cut that you use.

I agree with the reviewer from Decatur. Sure, the recipe is more complicated than sealing the brisket in foil with some Lipton's onion soup mix, but the sauce made from the reduction of wine, onions and bones is incomparable.

Yeah, it's time-consuming, but do yourself a favor and try this recipe. I first made this brisket for a dinner party a couple of years ago and found it to be a tender, juicy, savory hit! In other words, it's well worth the effort. You'll get tons of praise from your family and friends!! Here's a suggestion - try roasting the vegtables in a hot pan in the oven with a little garlic, fresh herbs and olive oil. In other words, don't boil them. Place your sliced brisket on a large platter surrounded by the roasted vegetables, then bring THIS dish out to the table. Your guests will LOVE you!

Having Grown up on a cattle farm in the Midwest, it's hard for me to sway from my mothers best recipe versions of cooking brisket. I thought I would try it prepared this way as a change from my mothers all but simple versions. I would have to say the end result, although very delicious, was quite a bit of work compared to my mothers somewhat simple alternatives. I'm convinced that slow roasting this cut of meat on a low temperature of 200 degrees with simple spices for 3 to 4 hours is the only way for me. That way I have time to concentrate on dessert.

After making this for a Christmas dinner in 1995, it is a must for all continuing Christmas dinners. It's become a tradition. Worth every bit of the time it takes to prepare.

I agree with the gentleman from New Jersey. Tender, flavorful brisket doesn't necessarily involve a lot of prep. Future suggestion? Take your brisket, pierce it all over, set on roasting rack in roasting pan. Then add about a cup of water to the bottom of the pan. Spread with a dry soup mix (onion is the best), sprinkle with a few drops of worcestershire and liquid smoke. Cover tightly with foil and cook in a 250-degree oven for as long as the weight requires. At this low a temperature, it's virtually impossible to get any other result than moist, tender, flavorful meat. Good eats!

This recipe turned out a good-tasting brisket. Why then, you might ask, do I not rate it better. Well, the recipe is needlessly complicated, and though it results in a good tasing brisket with a rich gravy, I have had better results with much simpler recipes. For example, the recipe for brisket with apricots, prunes and yams was far simpler to execute, and the finished dish was slightly better than this. So why go to all of the effort? Better to use one of the easier recipes and spend the time you save cleaning the basement.

Quite a bit of work but well worth the EFFORT. Make and invite your friends, you welcome their praise.
