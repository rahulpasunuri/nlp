This is an excellent, very tasty recipe and extremely easy to make. I added 1 tsp of chaat masala seasoning to give it a bit of an Indian flavour. Hazelnut oil and walnut oil are easily damaged/oxidized by heat and are therefore suitable for cold use only, not for cooking. I would use either butter or extra virgin olive oil.

This was so easy and tasty but I did make some changes, I did not have carrots and I was too lazy to dash to the store for carrots so I used celery instead. I sautéed the onions and celery first, oh and I did not have hazelnut nor walnut oil so I used canola oil, next time I will use one of these oils, I think it would make lentils even better. After sautéing onions & celery I added water and a bit of chicken broth brought to a bowl added the lentils and simmered on very low heat for about 40 minutes covered and uncovered last 5minutes.

I thought this recipe was really tasty, but I did make some changes: As suggested, I started by sautéing the diced onion and carrot in 1 tbsp hazelnut oil (I suspect olive oil would be fine) for about 10 minutes. Then I added 2 cups of water and a veg bouillon cube. Once that was boiling I turned down the heat and added 1 cup lentils, bay leaves, and cloves. I covered and cooked this over very low heat for about 40 minutes. Finally I removed the lid and simmered for about 5 minutes to evaporate the remaining liquid.

I have made this a couple of times, but only looked at the recipe the first time. Last time I sauteed the carrot and onion in walnut oil and added to the lentils when they were almost done cooking. I think I only used 1 cup of lentils instead of a pound. Anyway it's a nice, simple recipe.
