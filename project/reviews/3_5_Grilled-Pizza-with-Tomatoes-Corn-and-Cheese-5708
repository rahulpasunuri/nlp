Not impressed! I thought this pizza was very bland in spite of the ingredients.

This is a great appetizer for a summer party. Grilled corn on the cob and carmelized onion are great additions. I suggest rubbing the crust w/ roasted garlic and olive oil and you'll have a hit on your hands!

I've made this several times and we love it. I saute the corn on the stove with olive oil, garlic, shallots, jalapeno, and add cilantro and salt and pepper rigth at the end. I couldn't be bothered with making my own dough for a weeknight meal, so I used store-bought pizza dough. The fontina cheese is DELICIOUS! This is a great recipe.

This pizza was delicious, however it needs some zip. I added garlic, salt, and pepper to the corn. Next time I am going to try some southwestern seasoning and maybe some thinly slice red onions.

Great pizza topping! We used pre-made dough and baked, not grilled. Delicious.

Delicious. My husband is very opinionated about how he likes his pizza and he loved it. The fontina cheese melted very well.

Although my dough did not seem to rise as described in the recipe (yeast was probably old), these pizzas still came out tasting great! I did add a lot of garlic and salt+pepper to the corn kernels and skipped the jalepeno in favor of just hot pepper flakes. My husband was a little concerned about grilling them at first, but loved how it came out.

I used this crust recipe to experiment with grilling pizza...Loved it! Wanted a more traditional pizza, and always use the pizza sauce recipe on-line (do a search), which is just hi- grade canned tomatoes and olive oil. Used smoked mozz. and sundried tom. on one, delicious. I prefer not to cook crust on both sides when using a sauce...put the crust right on the grill w/sauce and toppings with good results, also made one on one of those pizza pans with the holes in it. Put the whole pan on the grill and coked covered over med-hi heat on a gas grill for only five min. or so. Make sure the temp stays up around 400 degrees, but don't do all burners on hi or the crust will burn. Bon appetit!

This pizza was good, but not great. I'd definitely suggest a good dose of salt and pepper for starters. Maybe some onions or garlic or sundried tomatoes would boost the flavor. For meat eaters, the addition of crumbled bacon would make this fabulous.

Easy to make, looked beautiful, tasted fantastic. A definite crowd pleaser! The dough can be grilled ahead, which cuts down on time away from your guests.
