This was OK. I admit I had to use surimi instead of "real" crab. But had I used real crab I would have felt like I had done an injustice. There have to be tastier options.

Perhaps it was because I was using claw meat (all that's available here), but I felt like something was missing. My husband and guests, however, disagreed with me and said that it was delicious. I served it over mixed greens as a starter.

I lost the bread and tossed the finished salad over a bed of Red Leaf lettuce. Umm & more Umm-umm-um!

I have made this twice and we have enjoyed it on our hot Maryland summer evenings. I will definitely make it again.

I bought the canned crabmeat at Trader Joe's on a whim then found this recipe. This is a great dish to whip up for your friend. Crack open a bottle of cheap champagne for afternoon "tea". :) I cut the crust off my toast points. Otherwise, I followed this recipe all the way.

Delicious recipe, loved the dressing. I will do it again and again. I modify the recipe a little bit, I added shredded carrots, I omitted scallions and I used surimi (crab flavor) in place of the crab meat.

I would not eat it again.
