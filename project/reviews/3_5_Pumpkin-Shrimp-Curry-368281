Oh, I forgot to say that I usually just use one cup of diced canned tomatoes for the plum tomato. And I keep lime leaves frozen so I don't have to make a special trip to the local Asian store. It's almost a pantry meal if you use frozen shrimp.

Four forks with these changes (inspired by some of the other reviewers): one lemongrass stalk chopped into 4 2inch pieces and smashed with the knife handle and sauteed with onion and ginger. 3 teaspoons curry powder and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder added with garlic for one minute. Use chicken broth and decrease to one can. Add 1-3 tablespoons fish sauce and one lime leaf snipped into tiny strips with chicken broth. Increase the squash to 2 cups. Top with cilantro, no need for lime zest Shallots optional. Holy Moly, we like this!

My husband really liked this but I thought it was slightly lacking in flavor. I added salt and shitake mushrooms. If I make this again I'll follow other reviewers suggestions and use less broth, increase the spices and use more butternut squash.

I made this recipe tonight and it does lack flavor like many of the other reviewers have mentioned. Instead of butternut squash I roasted a pumpkin and used that instead. But it still lacked the sweetness that pumpkin curry often has. I had to add 2 Tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of 5 spice, 1 TBSP of sugar (I used Coconut palm sugar), 1/8 tsp ground clove, and then a few dashes of the following (which amounted to less than 1/2 TBSP): garam masala, cumin, corriander. I think the cayenne could be cut back some as it packed a punch.

Tasty. Really easy... great for a cold winter evening meal. I am not a fan of cilantro, but I think that adding this would have given the flavor a little bit more zing.

I made some adjustments. I did a whole head of minced garlic, no ginger only because I forgot it, a can of diced tomatoes, I used thai coconout broth, an entire roasted half of butternut squash, added mushrooms, and chiken instead of shrimp. I pureed the pumpkin, squash and anything liquid (added heavy cream, brown sugar and sirancha) and threw everyhing in to the crock pot, cooked all day and served over jasmine rice. DELICIOUS.

What a great soup!! Exactly what I wanted to come home to on a lovely fall day! I made a number of modifications just to fit what was in my pantry. I omitted the shallots, garlic and ginger, but the soup was definitely flavorful enough. I carmelized the onions, added the entire can of coconut milk, used all of the butternut squash (about 1.5 c), added garlic salt, cumin, and extra curry powder, adjusted the consistency with light cream and more broth to account for the extra squash, and added chicken in addition to the shrimp. It is definitely a soup that is fun to play around with, adding things to your specific taste. I served it over a bed of red quinoa and it was gorgeous and delicious!

At the risk of exposing the level of my "rookieness" in the kitchen, this recipe looks great and easy EXCEPT it instructs you to add 1 cup roasted butternut squash. I assume I should buy a butternut squash and roast it for X minutes at Y degrees. Do I roast it whole? Do I cut it in half? I'm sure I can find a recipe for roasting squash elsewhere on the site or by Googling. But would it have killed the author of the recipe to add 1-2 extra steps for novice cooks?

I also was very excited about this recipe, I mean look at the picture? It LOOKS delicious! But like another review said - it is lacking a flavor. Not sure what it is, but IF I make it again I know I won't be following this recipe exactly. I could see adding extra butternut squash helping with the taste. I think I also would prefer chicken over shrimp. But even changing those two things I don't think it will give it that flavor it just seems to be missing.

I was so excited about this and was convinced I would like it despite earlier poor reviews, however I was sadly disappointed. It looks like others have tried some modifications that sound promising. Maybe if you have really strong curry powder or you use the garam masala this would be good...as it is written though it was not impressive. In fact I refused to suffer through the leftovers and ended up throwing a ton out the next day. Maybe with some serious modifying it would be good...

Modifications: Tripled the amount of butternut squash. After roasting, I had about 5 cups of squash. Put in 3. Added more curry powder and a half TBS of garam masala. I would do more than a pound of shrimp next time. Topped with a mass of cilantro, pumpkin shrimp curry is delicious!

Just finished this and it was fantastic! I made a few changes -- used gold potatoes instead of butternut squash, and cut the amount of broth per other recommendations. I also added green beans and a Fresno pepper, and seasoned with turmeric and garam masala instead of curry powder. The fried shallots didn't add anything, and the potato flavor overwhelmed (my fault! next time I'm going to try the butternut) -- but it was still a definite winner!

My family raves about this! They love it with shrimp, but I prefer using chicken. The fried shallots are a MUST, really gives this meal an added oomph! I think the type of curry powder you use makes a difference; I use a curry powder from India. If I added garam masala it would be overwhelming. The only other thing I added (as suggested by other reviewers) was sea salt. Otherwise, I disagree with the reviewer from Tucson that suggests Bon Appetit change the recipe. We love it (pretty much) as is.

Bon Appetit should go ahead and change the recipe based on reviewers suggestions. After reading reviews, I too used 1/2 TBS garam masala + 1/2 TBS spice mix (tumeric, ground cumin, corriander, chilli powder). I also reduced the amount of broth used to make it less "soupy". The result was absolutely delicious, and I would make this recipe again (with these changes).

on a cold day in January in northern Michigan my girlfriend had come down with a cold. We got to discussing dinner and she said she really just wanted some soup. I came across this recipe and knew I could convert into a great soup with some modifications: I replaced the shrimp with chicken, added extra curry, and some sea salt. Replaced the tomato with a can of diced tomatoes. Left out the ginger, and the shallots. I then did all the sautéing in my wok but then transferred it all to a crock pot. Added equal parts heavy whipping cream and extra broth to get the creamy soup consistency I was after and let it slow cook most of the day. I served it with a whole wheat baguette and a dollop of sour cream. It turned out delicious. My girlfriend loved it and it was just what she needed to make her feel a little better.

This has become a staple in my house. Its so delicious and reheats really well. Sometimes if I'm pressed for time, I substitute broccoli or another veg for the roasted squash and its just as good. I also inevitably have left-over coconut milk which I add to chocolate chip cookies for a great dessert afterwards.

Like everyone else, I modified. For sure needs more curry. I plan to make it again for my dinner group but will make the sauce and marinate and grill the shrimp separately for a better presentation. Plan on serving with lemon basmati rice.

I really enjoyed this! I took most of the suggestions here (1T of curry, 1T of garam masala, halved the stock, and added salt). I also toasted the spices before I put them in and I think that helped with the depth of flavor. All in all, a keeper!

Rating: 4
WOW! This is delicious! We made some changes similar to other reviewers. We increased the spices to a 1/2 T of Curry and 1/2 T of Garam Masala and doubled the cayanne pepper. We also added 1 less cup broth and increased the coconut milk by 1 cup. It is the best curry I have ever made!

This dish was very good with the suggested additions of salt, extra curry and less broth. Great winter comfort food. I did not feel that the shrimp were overwhelmed. We will make this dish again.

As other reviewers mentioned, I made similar modifications. Increased curry powder to 1 Tablespoon, added a chopped jalepeno, reduced broth to 1 cup, and used 2 cups of coconut milk. Also, I used a tablespoon of fish sauce, which gave it the signature asian/curry flavor. Oh - and I used salmon instead of shrimp, which stood up nicely to the texture/spice. Delicious!

Living in Japan, I used the Japanese Kobacha squash so did not need to use the pumpkin pulp. I also used leeks instead of onions and 2 cups of fresh chopped spinach at the very end. Kids went back for seconds.

I rarely use salt when cooking, but this definitely needed a dash. I also increased the amount of curry powder and cayenne, and I added 1/8 tsp of chipotle chili powder. It then received rave reviews!

This was good but it needs tweaking. I added salt (as the other reviewers did), plus twice the cayenne pepper to give it more of a kick, and then I sprinkled chopped up crystallized ginger on the top--YUM!

This was good. After reading the reviews I added salt, reduced the broth by half (chicken broth instead of vegetable)and increased the curry powder amount to 2 tsp. I must say the shrimp were a bit overwhelmed and their flavor didn't really come through as much as I would have liked.

So good! So easy! Make it what you want. We had it over some bulgar I tried to sprout...yeah, dumb story.

Salt! It needs salt. I added about 1/2 tsp of kosher salt. Without that, it would be so bland. Add the salt when you mix in the coconut milk and broth. I also used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Olive oil just seems wrong in an Asian curry. Once you season it up with salt, it was is quite tasty. It was also the perfect counterpoint to some spicy roasted green beans I made with it.

Agree with other reviewers-- seriously bland as written. Modifications for this round included: crab instead of veggie stock, combo of shrimp and bay scallops, tripled the curry powder and the cayenne, added 2 t. coconut sugar and some extra salt. It really needed balance with sugar/salt/acid/fresh element to even out the earthy pumpkin/squash. It was much improved with a hearty helping of all the garnishes. Next time I'll: decrease canned pumpkin and increase broth for a soupier consistency, perhaps use a zippier masala instead of plain curry powder, cook the squash cubes in the broth, stir in a good bit of lime zest, and serve with more zest, cilantro and fried shallots for garnish.

B-O-R-I-N-G!! Lacked flavor. This dish needs lots of additional spices. Chili flakes would help. Roasting the squash etc. made this a lot of work without any real flavor. I would NOT make this again!

I made this dish last week and it was wonderful! We used chicken instead of shrimp due to an allergy and it was still great. I marinated the chicken with a little olive oil and curry powder and baked. Additionally, I added 1.5 times the amount of curry powder adn 2 times the amount of cayenne, as we love spice! Great dish will definitely make again.

I can't imagine how bland this dish would have been without my modifications - and even so, it was lacking some oomph. I used potatoes instead of butternut squash, added about 1 tbsp. red curry paste, 1 tbsp thai fish sauce, and additional tsp of paprika, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp clear hot pepper sauce, and 1 tsp chopped chives at the end. And it still didn't quite knock my socks off...

Like other reviewers, I'd say this dish was average as written, but has the potential to be great with some additions. For me, it was more lime juice and a tablespoon+ of thai red curry paste. I also added in sugar snap peas for color and texture.

made a few adjustments like extra curry powder, used shrimp stock (made myself from shrimp heads, peelings a while back)instead of vegetable stock, LOTS of cilantro and added some roasted cumin seeds. Keep in mind that the quality of the ingredients makes a huge diff in flavor. Use good quality curry, coconut milk, etc. Also, I never use butternut squash bigger than 1.5 lbs. The difference in flavor between larger and smaller squash is amazing. This is a really good basic recipe that can be easily tweaked to add more flavor

I think the recipe itself is good. I used chicken stock in place of vegetable stock and chicken breast in place of shrimp and it was very flavorful. I used a little too much cayenne by accident, but that may have helped to make it not so bland.

I made this dish for my work Halloween potluck and it was a big hit. I ommitted the butternut squash on accident, but am thinking I may use butternut squash soup in place of part of the vegetable stock. And next time I'll add more curry! YUMMM!

I have to completely agree with "A Cook from Milwaukee". I also substituted acorn squash, but otherwise followed the recipe entirely. I was so disappointed in how blah it was. There was no depth of flavor at all. I think roasting the squash was an entirely unnecessary step too. Couldn't taste the squash, and it added so much more time to the recipe.

Rating: 1
I followed this recipe to the letter, with the exception of a substitution of acorn squash for butternut. Overall, this dish was rather bland. It may be due to the brand of pumpkin puree that I used, but the pumpkin flavor did not come through at all and using unsweetened coconut milk adds nothing to this dish. Aside from the heat from the curry and the cayenne, this dish was a dud.

Rating: 0
After reading the reviews, I replaced the butternut squash with 1 1/2 cups of diced, peeled baked potato and 2 teaspoons of garam masala (real Indian "curry powder"). Two of my children were not huge fans of the dish, but the rest of us really enjoyed it. Very quick and easy!! FYI I paired the dish with an Australian muscato -- slightly sweet with apricot and mango flavors -- because it was what I had on hand, but a Reisling with higher acid and similar tropical flavor profile would be what I would try next time.

A perfect recipe for fall: thick, creamy, redolent with spices, and delicious. I agree with the previous reviewer that the squash adds little taste, but the squash does add another texture to the dish. I added more salt to the dish to balance the sweetness of the pumpkin and squash. I used fresh key lime juice (more tart than the juice of Persian limes), and the acidity really brightened the overall flavor

Rating: 3
This was a delicious recipe with a great creamy texture, however I would have skipped the roasted butternut squash all together. It contributed no flavor to the dish whatsoever, and it added unnecessary time onto the recipe. Also, use extra cayenne or a medium curry powder as it was too mild even for someone who doesn't usually need heat.
