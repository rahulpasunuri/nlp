Have also been making these since the early 90s and everybody loves them. After many years of making them as per the recipe, i have substituted roasted almonds for the hazelnuts and don't dip in chocolate. It saves a lot of time and the results are good.

I've been making these fantastic cookies since 1992 and everyone always loves them. No step of the recipe is difficult, so you're pretty much guaranteed success if you put the time and effort into making them... and they do take a lot of time, but they're so worth it!

I have been making this since the day the magazine arrived in the mail. Dipping the biscotti in chocolate makes a fabulous presentation. Everyone raves about this recipe and I receive more requests for this than anything else I make. Be forewarned: it does take a lot of time.

One of my favorite gift giving recipes. I have been making them for seven years now---they are wonderful. Also excellent with almonds.
