Wonderful salad! Fresh, light flavors. Served with a few hazelnut crackers and made for a nice combination of crunch. Only issue was that the yield was surprisingly small. I made for 4 for a lunch. It was not nearly enough. Tiny portions. Added salt to dressing to liven up.

The vinaigrette is great, and the salad is light and fresh. Perfect for an outdoor picnic. Needed a little salt and pepper. Not quite as good on the second day.

Lighten up everyone. Boston has a great sense of humor(at least, I think she was joking)and I'm sure Michelle would enjoy the comment.

This is a very pretty, crunchy, unique salad, but as is, it's a little bland. I added vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste and the family loved it. I let it sit for a little while to absorb flavors.

The only change I made to this recipe, was to omit the honey. (I forgot about it.) It was excellent! Very fresh tasting, with a lot of good crunch.

Not good at all. I'm curious why this received such good ratings. Beans and radishes...how good can that be? "Healthy" but tasteless. There are too many good summer salads to try to waste your time on this one.

Loved this. Complementary flavors meant no need to over dress. We used agave nectar instead of the suggested honey. Great balance of textures between the soft beans and the crunchier vegetables. We used beans from a can.

What a healthy, refreshing salad -- perfect for a hot summer evening. I had to make it ahead of time and refrigerate, but it didn't suffer from the pre-mixing. Very colorful. The beans sort of get lost; I might add some more next time.

Shame on you cook from Boston. Just because they didn't use your preferred beans doesn't make this recipe deserve 1 star. Think before you write & stop being a snob.

I haven't tried the recipe, but think it sounds wonderful. I really object to the sarcastic remarks of "A Cook from Boston," and do not think the one star from said cook should be consideredand I would say 100% would make it again, because that person's rating should not count.

Love it! With it being so hot & dry, this recipe is a welcome change from the same old-same old. BTW, to the kook from Boston, when you go shopping, look for those black, brown, yellow, red, & green beans as well as the SF fruitcake --it's really all there -- right in your own neighborhood!

Delicious, fresh, light, filling - took to a ladies get-together last night outdoors and it was hot. This dish hit the spot! I'm anxious to buy the First Lady's book. And, thank you, by a Cook, for calling out the Boston review.

To the cook from Boston, this is not the place for your nasty political remarks.

This was so simple and so good. I used canned beans and didn't bother blanching the sugar snap peas. Delicious.

Wonderful summer meal! I had everything on hand and most things were from my garden including the honey. I wouldn't change a thing, except to double the recipe!

It's going to be hot, hot, hot this week in the Northeast so I am planning on making this delicious sounding light bean salad. I have on hand locally grown asparagus that I will use in place of the snap peas. That's the nice thing about these types of salads- you can usually substitute one of the veggies (or types of beans) for another, especeially this time of year when they are fresh and abundant. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used canned beans and it was a perfectly delicious, quick and easy supper salad. Flavorful without being fussy. I'm inspired to purchase Michelle's book now! I'm always looking for ways to include more fresh produce in easy summer meals.

Not very PC, Michelle! It should included Black, brown, yellow, red and some San Francisco fruitcake beans.
