First Prime Rib I've done, so was skeptical and nervous. Luckily I follow the Julia Childs method of cooking and had cocktails at the ready to steady my nerves. First, followed the recipe to the letter. Was initially concerned the peppercorns would be too over powering. Fortunately they were not. While cooking time is at best an estimate, let your thermometer be your guide. For sides, sliced portabello mushrooms and egg plant in a nice butter saute' with potatos augraten along with fresh home made horseradish. Everything paired very well with a Merlot. A keeper for sure, looking forward to next time already.

I thought this was excellent. I used (as others did), mixed peppercorns, not having any of the pink kind and it still was delicious. I've cook several Prime Ribs over the years for the holidays, but think this is my new favorite!

This turned out really well. Next time I'd make just a bit more crust. For the sauce I deglazed the wine in the roasting pan until it was reduced to very little liquid. Then added some beef stock & finished it. I would double the sauce next time wasn't quite enough. My family loved the dinner, will make it again.

You know, this is great, but not "OMG so amazing it has to go down in history". I think mainly the reason why it is 4 forks is that it's roast prime rib, which (if given even a halfway decent recipe) is nearly guaranteed to come out delish. That said, the crust on this roast is pure genius. Peppercorns I had seen before, but allspice is not something you run across often in beef. This sweetish spice is brilliantly compounded by the sugar and mustard. Definitely worth making again. A good "dinner party" dish, especially when Trader Joe's is selling prime rib roasts.

Excellent-recommend you follow the recipe exactly. Only thing I noticed was it took a little longer to come up to the desired temperature than stated. A Christmas and New Year's classic.

I had a party of 25, and everyone said it was delicious! The crust is soooo good!

Absolutely the best standing rib roast recipe. Buy the best beef you can; have the butcher cut the meat from the bones then tie the bones back on for cooking. Makes it super easy to slice since you can remove the bones before you carve it. Even my kids say the sauce "makes" the dish.

This is a consistently terrific dish prepared as written.

I didn't have any whole allspice, so I omitted it. Some slices were fairly spicy with all that pepper. Also, it took 3 hours to cook a medium rare, 5.5 lb roast. I'm not sure if that was my roaster, or an error in the recipe. The sauce is delicious as-is. We made this recipe for Christmas Day and we're making it again for New Year's Day.

Wonderful! I bought a much larger prime rib and cooked it on the bone for a graduation party, and we had leftovers for a week. The only caution is, be careful using the dripping for au jus- all that pepper! Taste it and have some stock on hand to cut it.

I made this with both mixed peppercorns (the cheap version) and the pink/green peppercorns. Both came out delicious, but the special pink/green peppercorns really made this a uniquely exquisite dish. It was even more delicious as leftovers. Do not be deterred if you can't buy the green/pink peppercorns. It will just be a 3-3 1/2 star dish instead of a 4. I wasn't too crazy about the pan sauce. Instead, I made a basic au jus with beef broth, Worcestire sauce, and pan bits. This prime rib recipe is a keeper, you won't need to look any further.

This dish is fabulous. I didn't have the all spice berries but it didn't make a difference. I also added 2 cloves of well mashed garlic cloves to the paste, only because we are garliholics. I did make the sauce exactly as the recipe and it was delicious. I made it New Year's Eve with mashed potatoes and again for a dinner party of 10 with roasted potatoes. It was a hit both times.

Although I'm a relatively accomplished and adventurous cook, I'd never made prime rib before. This one was an adventure. I didn't plan very well, so this required a couple of trips to the grocery store, and, to top it off, I found when I went to take the rib's temperature at the appropriate time, that my meat thermometer had gone on strike (it read the center of the meat at 39 degrees). In any case, when all was said and done, this was AWESOME. OK, so you can't go wrong with prime rib, but I was a little worried that the paste would mess with the gravy. My fears were unfounded. The gravy and the beef rocked the house in all the right ways.

I've made this now, 4 times this season for customers and will be making 2 more tonight for catering customers. It always gets rave reviews. The sauce I pass on. It's not that great. I'll be making another. Just make sure to dump the fat that accumulates after the initial baking at 500. The foil is a great idea too but I haven't had too many smoking problems as long as you dump the fat. I serve with Porcini Potato Gratin that I make a bit different. I've left notes there. Popovers are also a hit with this. You can make them ahead and reheat while the roast is resting.

Rating: 4
Relatively simple recipe with outstanding results. Family and friends loved it. I refrigerated the paste before putting it on the roast to avoid the melting problems others mentioned. Also, I have a dark roasting pan, so I found that putting foil in the base of the pan during the initial searing stage helped eliminate the smoking that sometimes occurs.

This was truly delicious. I did not make the sauce, but made a mushroom, port, zinfandel sauce from another recipe on this site. We also served it with fresh horseradish. I had never made prime rib and this was easy and delicious!

I created a meal around this recipe to thank our neighbors for a huge favor. It was an amazing treat for us all and the gravy was unbelievable. I've already recommended it to several friends and we'll have it again for Christmas dinner this year!

I've never made prime rib before, so this was an adventure. But it was a simple adventure that turned out perfectly. A rib roast with some slope to it allows medium rare to well in the same roast. Guests were quite impressed. The peppercorns added more flavor as leftovers than to the original roast.

Takes an old staple and makes it exquisite. If you have leftovers the sauce can be extended by adding a bit of wine.

Used a tenderloin, broiled it earlier in the day with just butter on top to color it. Then spread with crust mix for final 15 min. in oven. Thought the peppercorn mix too complex for the effort, but the sauce was just right. Everyone loved it, though.

Really tasty and the crust fills the house with a great aroma. The Red Wine sauce was a great accompanyment.

Absolutely delicious! Don't get too stressed if you can't find all pink peppercorns...the mixed ones work fine. (Williams-Sonona does carry all pink though). This was so easy to make but next time I will omit the wine sauce. The crust made the meat juicy enough.

We had this for Christmas dinner last night and it was outstanding! I used a 6 lb. tenderloin in place of the roast which I seasoned with salt and pepper, seared in roasting pan with olive oil and let it come back to room temp before putting on the crust. Then I roasted at 425 for 15 mins. and reduced to 350 for about 20 - came out at 130 and rose to 142 before serving. The ends were a bit too done for my liking (med-rare me) but other members of my family really like medium to med-well so that was good. And the middle was perfect for me! Made the pan sauce as instructed - amazing! Served with mashed bliss potatoes with mushrooms and green onions, roasted asparagus, sauteed mushrooms - really great if added to pan sauce! - rosemary popovers and a simple salad. We all ate too much and had no room for dessert. What is really great about this menu is that it is fairly simple and easy to get dinner to the table in about 1 1/2 hours or less if you are well prepared.

This is a great recipe. I have been given rave reviews every time I make it. I subtituted a rib eye roast for the standing rib roast....same thing without the bones. It takes much longer to cook than the time shown. Be sure to use the low sodium beef broth or the gravy will be too salty.

As I made the peppercorn mixture, I became increasingly certain that this recipe would be one that everyone would rave about. It was simply the best standing rib I have ever had -- strength and subtly in both the crust and the pan sauce. I served it for Xmas Eve dinner, using a 11+ lb. roast, which required doubling the peppercorn crust. Otherwise, I made it as specified in the recipe. I did not have a smoke problem while searing, and by using a spatula, I was able to spread the peppercorn mixture over the roast easily in just a minute or so. I served it with stiffly whipped potatoes with gremolata on the side, sauteed mushrooms, and green beans and carrots with a mustard-chevril butter sauce. All very tasty.

Made this for Christmas dinner--the crust was amazing, and it was a huge hit. Well worth the effort for a special dinner. Made my own sauce with caramelized shallots, shitake mushrooms, red wine, and the pan drippings.

Wonderfully delicious...surprising easy! Made this for Christmas dinner and won "thumbs up" all around the table. Williams-Sonoma carries Pink and Green Peppercorns, for those in search of them.

Made this last night for a dinner party. Used a 12 pound prime rib-eye roast, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. After searing at 500 degrees for 30 minutes, I found it difficult to apply the crust ingredients, as the roast was hot, and the butter in the rub was melting as I applied it. The searing, by the way, caused a lot of smoke. You may consider adding some water to the roasting pan to prevent this (although I'm not sure if that interferes with the searing process). Since I was working with a larger roast, the cooking time was longer, however, it was difficult to calculate the cooking time due to the 30 minutes of searing up front. In all, it took only 2.5 hours (including the 30 minutes of searing up front) to cook the 12 pound monster. My remote probe registered 135 when I took the roast out which resulted in medium doneness in the center cuts (pink, no red). I would have preferred a darker pink in the center, and should have removed at 130 or 125 as others have suggested. Glad there was a heated sauce to go with this, by the time my other dishes cooked, the roast had cooled for 30 minutes, and was not as warm as I would have liked. Not any fault of the recipe, just hard adapting and planning for a larger roast.

I made the crust from this recipe and followed the instructions in this recipe for the roasting process. However, I made the Au Jus from the Prime Rib with Cabernet Jus recipe the day before. It took a little less than an hour to reduce, contrary to what was stated by many of the other writers, but it may be because I used a dutch oven with a larger surface area than a saucepan and also because I have a gas Viking Range, which may be hotter than many users' stoves. The combination of the 2 recipes was absolutely wonderful - a great way to close the Year 2000!

WONDERFUL RECIPE FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER FOR 30. INSTEAD OF RIB ROAST, USED A BONELESS TENDERLOIN WITH LESS WASTE. SUBSTITUTED WHITE PEPPERCORNS FOR THE PINK (RAN OUT OF TIME IN MY QUEST FOR PINK!). LOVELY TASTE,EASY TO MAKE, RECIPE EASY TO FOLLOW AND THE FINAL RESULTS WERE DELICIOUS.

Excellent method of cooking the best piece of beef. Sauce is great with its wine flavor. I would pull it out of the oven at 125 degrees, I used my new digital meat thermometer w/ovenproof probe. 135 degrees gave me a medium done not medium rare. Very Good though!

Huge hit at Christmas dinner. I agree, the peppercorns were difficult to find but were a nice addition. The sauce is wonderful. Will certainly make it again.

My husband has made this for Christmas every year since 1994. It is a huge family hit and one of those meals you dream and talk about all year long. The pink peppercorns can be tough to find but our local natural food store has them in bins. Try this if your looking for something special!

We merged this recipe with the Cabernet Jus recipe, using this crust recipe and the Cabernet Jus sauce recipe. YUM!!! We cut down on the peppercorns to a total of 3 tablespoons, and the crust was plenty peppery. We spent the extra money and bought a prime grade prime rib, and it was a huge hit. This was for a fancy dinner party we had, and every one of our 10 guests raved at how good the meat was. We are going to make it again for Christmas dinner, it was that good. We still have plenty of Jus, so won't have to do that labor again.

I made this dish for our 1999 Xmas dinner and it was a huge hit. It should have been as the beef cost Can. $11 per pound and I bought a 10 pound roast. I also went to 4 stores (during the Xmas rush) for those pink peppercorns and could not find them. I bought a bottle of mixed ones and picked out as many of the pinks as I could and then used white. For a 10 lb. roast, the cooking time of 1 1/2 hours is barely enough. It was on the rare side in the middle of the roast but other than all that - it was fabulous and the group of 12 polished the whole thing off!!

This recipe is so good we have made it for our family Christmas dinner every year since it was first published back in '94. While the peppercorns are a little pricey, for a special meal it is well worth the investment. It's also easy.
