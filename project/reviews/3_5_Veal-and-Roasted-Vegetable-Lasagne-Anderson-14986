This is a great recipe! Whether you take short cuts or build it from the ground up, don't forget to roast the veggies, they are what create the unique flavor. While the combo seemed odd when I read it, I varied the vegetables only with the types of peppers that I used - red and poblano. Simply delicious.

Left out the veal for a vegetarian (which I am not) lasagne. You won't miss the meat.

Be prepared for a lot a preparation for this one for only a so so outcome. Not horrible but not special either --- I have leftovers in the freezer and no one wants them. Pales in comparison to the good old regular lasagne this Italian family is accustomed to eating.

This Lasagne is definitely worth every minute it takes to prepare. I served it for dinner group that I belong to and everyone asked for the recipe. I froze the leftovers and brought them out for dinner about a week later......absolutely super!!

Excellent. I increased the veal sauce to 1 lb veal and additional 14 oz can tomatoes. I used fresh mozarella - 8 oz w/ ricotta and 8oz sprinkled. Made a very rich lasagne.

Could have used more tomato paste and the spices and veggies can be increased, decreased, or changed at the cook's discretion. Though this recipe is very flexible, I would recommend the pre-preparation hints included in the recipe to cut down on time. Definitely not a dish to make in a hurry, but family commented they would love to have it several times again.
