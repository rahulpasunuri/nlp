This has become one of my favorite dressings. I use spring salad mix instead of endive, and add grapes if I don't have apples. I serve this salad with parmesan crisps.

The dressing really perks up with a few splashes of white wine vingear. I added roasted beets and used goat cheese instead of parmesan. Very, very good.

The dressing is bland. Otherwise, the salad is nothing special.

I love this salad. My only suggestion would be to include candid walnuts instead of just toasted. Adds pizzazz!

I don't like endive so I used regular field greens and just mixed everything together. For the dressing I added some balsamic and extra mustard. My guests went CRAZY for this salad they were scraping the bottoms of their bowls after they took seconds.

Considering I find endives bitter, this was really good. Hid the bitter taste.

This is a fantastic salad. Quick to make and much better than out of a bag; definately one to impress on short notice. My girlfriend loved the dressing, but I thought it needed a little more mustard. The apples add a very nice touch.

I made this for a family dinner and there was not a morsel left on any of the plates. Mom had the leftovers the next day and it stayed fresh even with the dressing & the apples did not discolor. Will definitely be making on a regular basis. Great combination of flavors.

i was looking for a way to use walnut oil in a dressing and i also love dijon mustard so this vinagrette was made to order. i don't think this will work as well using just olive oil. the walnut oil adds a richness to the dressing that, while subtle, is wonderful. i found that i needed very little dressing, making the salad very light, yet extremely satisfying and flavorful. this is a very elegant starter to any steak entree. the flavors give it a dinstinctive european flavor-reminds me of Paris. No one does a salad quite like the French. Try this! You can keep any leftover vinagrette in a jar or small tupperware tub. I also used plenty of fresh ground pepper served at the table. P.S. Try adding roasted beets around the edge of the plate. Sweet and yummy!

This recipe is too boring, but the dressing might be good on a different salad.
