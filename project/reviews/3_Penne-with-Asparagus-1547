This is the first time I've said I wouldn't make something again. The basic tomato sauce is fine, but the asparagus just doesn't go with it.

This was pretty simple, nice, but nothing special. I would think about making it again, but will probably look for something else.

We have made this dish several times and love it! I have added cooked shrimp one time,grilled chicken,and (cooked)Italian sausage to the dish, and we loved it with either the chicken or sausage added to it. This dish has a nice "zip" to it from the red pepper that we feel really makes the dish. I halve the recipe, as there are only two of us, and it makes more than enough for a hearty dinner and lunch the next day too. I add a can of tomato sauce as well, so the pasta is not so dry. Overall, it is an excellent recipe and very easy to make! We highly recommend it!

This dish was just okay, but it definately has potential. I used Cellentani pasta instead of penne and I also added some mushrooms. The dish looked absolutely beautiful, like something you want to serve to company, but it lacked something. I think adding half sweet and half hot italian sausages would make it a fabulous dish.

This was fairly simple to make -- something working families don't have to wait for the weekend to make. My family enjoyed it, but wasn't overwhelmed. It was a nice twist, though. Different from the boring pasta sauce we usually eat.

Nice, but ordinary.

This recipe produces a very tasty dinner, and the presentation is also excellent. Only change I made was to add 1 oz of reconsituted porcini mushrooms and their soaking liquid. This enhance the recipe and everyone loved it.

Made this for my family of 2 adults, two teenagers and one pre-school aged....still could have invited a couple of more adults! Portions were more than ample. I served this with crusty bread, a large bowl of freshly grated parmesan and a cool reisling. The color of the dish was lovely. I did not have a chance to make it several hours in advance and followed the directions as presented. Great!

We enjoyed this dish. Found the servings to be more than ample. I cut back on onions to 1 1/2 C. and the red pepper flakes according to our taste. Thought it was so good I copied and sent off to family members. Well worth trying.

The broccoli I was forced to use as a last minute substitute turned out fine. I liked this dish very much.

This was a great recipe, quick, easy and a new way to use asparagus. I also added grilled pork tenderloin chunks

I made this dish in the morning, to allow the flavors to come together before being reheated at dinner. It was a wonderful blend of flavors and textures. The onions, sauteed until golden added a carmelized sweetness that really pulled the dish together. Next time, I may add some fresh tomatoes in addition to the canned to further enhance the flavors. Absolutely makes enough for six to eight people. I'll happily eat this as leftovers for the next few days.

Delicious! Unfortunately I lost the recipe and method that I had written down after purchasing the ingredients - but I managed to cook it well enough. Next time I think I will leave out the onions and maybe throw in some capers.

i prepare this recipe with the addition of oven raosted chicken breasts/cut into chunks and added to the finished dish i call it blue moon pasta !

Very tasty, we are big eaters, but this sure seems more like it serves 6 - 8 people. We love the leftovers. I used fresh oregano.

This light,tasty and easy dish is perfect for warm spring days. It isn't heavy and would be ideal for a luncheon or casual dinner. It tastes even better with a few added fresh tomatoes.

Made this recipe last night with a few alterations: used the entire butter, oil, and garlic, but cut other ingredients in half. The seasonings were delicate enough to allow the asparagus to dominate the dish, but the second servings were even better than the first. Next time I will allow the dish to "cure" a bit after adding the pasta and cheese and before serving. It was a delicious meal with the suggested salad and bread.
