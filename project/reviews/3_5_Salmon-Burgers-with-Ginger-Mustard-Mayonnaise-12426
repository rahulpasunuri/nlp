These came out delicious, though I skipped the mayo, and served it on a plate with rice and veggies. Kids loved them. Instead of mincing the salmon by hand, I gave it a quick few spins in the food processor. The burgers held their shape while being fried on a non-stick skillet.

Rating: 3
We made this exactly as written ... and I agree with previous reviewers who said mincing the salmon fine is key. The patties wouldn't hold shape so I added an egg and reformed the patties. We also found the "burgers" dry, even with the dijon ginger mayo ...

Wow! Surprised by the negative reviews. Prepared it exactly as written except I added an egg white and frozen salmon (defrosted). Usually my husband doesn't take lots of joy from eating, but he loved it. And he loved it hot which is unusual. I think it is really important to chop the salmon very well. Enjoy!

Just ok.

I made these for my roommates birthday dinner and they turned out great. She's not fond of mayo so I just made the patties and we ate them with a fork and a little sweet chili sauce on the side. I used dried ginger, and added an egg to help hold them together. Would like to make this recipe again and play with some other flavor combos.

tasted more like eating a ginger burger than a salmon burger...hides all of the natural salmon flavor!

Great burgers. I skin salmon by heating a nonstick skillet very hot and putting salmon skin-side down for 1 minute. Flip salmon onto a cutting board and skin just peels off, but salmon hasn't had time to cook at all.

These worked well with grilled salmon from a previous night, although they did crumble a bit. We did, however, follow the previous comment about the wasabi mayo and it was great.

I loved this recipe even though my husband thought it was just okay. The flavors were great while the ingredients were simple. Like others, the hardest part was removing the salmon from the skin. Also took other reviewer advice and added 2 tablespoons of plain bread crumbs. I will absolutely make these again!

We loved these! Very rich and delicious and a great variation to our typical grilled marinated salmon. Made recipe as is except the addition of panko crumbs. Served with sliced tomatos on toasted Kaiser rolls with side of sauteed baby bok choy. Yummy!

I too was skeptical about making "salmon" burgers but this recipe is great. I didn't think cutting up the salmon was too difficult. Used a fillet knife to remove the skin. I did add some bread crumbs and an egg to keep it together. I also grilled them...yum

I was a little skeptical about burgers made of salmon - but went with the rave reviews and glad I did. This is a great recipe. Followed to a tee except for adding about 2TBS panko crumbs as recommended by other reviewers. Thought the consistency and flavors were perfect. Served on Kaiser rolls with a Ceasar salad on the side. Use good salmon for this and you can't go wrong.

This is a keeper! I added breadcrumbs by the Tbsp until I got the right 'burger' consistency (3 total for about 1 lb salmon). My husband went ape!

Great recipe... but use an egg and bread crumbs to keep the burger together.

YUMMY! Loved them! They tasted like salmon kebabs, so flavorful and tender. We had tons of King Alaskan in the freezer my husband caught and it was the perfect way to use it! Because both the salmon and mayo called for ginger, I did switch to wasabi in the mayo and it was a great, but I may put the ginger or a little more flavor in the mayo next time. Great with sweet potato fries, too!

This is a delicious and fast recipe. I added some chopped celantro for flavor. It is not dry if cooked properly. Great on a toasted kaiser roll or onion roll. I also add lettuce to the tomato and onion garnish. Don't skip the ginger mayo. This is a winner with mild flavors.

VERY MESSY!!! But tastes great! I won't make it to often, need lots of napkins!

This was delicious and simple -- I already had everything in the kitchen. Instead of "ginger mustard mayonnaise", I made "ginger wasabi mayo", removing the dijon mustard and adding wasabi paste to taste. This added completity to the flavors and kept the sauce from tasting just like the salmon. A definite keeper!

Rating: 3
Messy, but very good!! Try to cut the salmon in the smallest pieces possible. And don't forget to ask your fish monger to trim off the skin! Mistake on my part!

I think this is my second review, earlier I just put the seasonings on filets. Either that or all the Chicagoians in Boston are liable to mangle the recipe in the same [good] way... Never one to follow the instructions, this time I used canned salmon and followed thru on the burger format. Very good. Stayed together for the most part; no egg.

at first bite, my boyfriend and i couldn't believe how juicy and flavorful the salmon patty was, and we kept on enjoying it. but, by the end of the meal we were quite green about the gills! i must say that the burger, while very tasty, was a little too rich especially with the added mayo. even the double amount of ginger i used didn't cut the richness much. i agree with the reviewer that said grilled salmon with lemon is just as good, if not better! those who love rich food should really enjoy this. those who prefer a cleaner pallette should stay away!

This recipe was so quick and easy. Both my husband and myself loved it - -will definitely make it again.

This recipe was not easy to make. Chopping raw salmon by hand is difficult and messy. I ended up cutting it with kitchen sheers after getting the skin side off. Grating fresh ginger is a stringy mess. The patties did not stick together, I followed the recipe precisely. My kids did not like it. I thought it was ok, but grilled salmon with lemon would have been as good and a lot less work. I can safely say, I will never make this again.

Surprisingly good! I appreciated the tip from Chicago on just spreading the sauce on the salmon fillets. It turned out great!

Rating: 3
this recipe undeniably produced a delicious salmon burger with an Oriental nod (the ginger and soy taste in the salmon patties brings to mind the steamed fish dishes you order in high-end chinese restaurants). but, i must say that by the fourth bite the boyfriend and i were tasting a little too much of the rich fish. we finished the burger anyway and it was very filling. i used more ginger than called for - maybe i'll use sour cream instead of mayo and plenty of squeezed lemon, too.

Even easier than the burgers, just spread the burger binding ingredients on top of the salmon and bake it at 350-400 for 10+ minutes. Great!

This definately needed some bread crumbs to stick together- Unlike some other reviewers I liked the amount of ginger- This was well recieved with no extras- just the burgers and mao

This was a wonderfully easy meal. Add some chardonnay, Caesar Salad and YUM!

I didn't have trouble keeping the patties together - the soy sauce and dijon mustard provided enough moisture to bind the salmon. Thanks to the previous posters who commented about the amount of ginger in the salmon - I cut back to 1 teaspoon, and it was plenty. I also added one shallot, minced - provided a depth of flavour and texture. Instead of making the ginger mustard mayo, I made a chipotle mayo - perfect with salmon!

We loved this! I did make some changes though. Followed most of the recipe but used pickled ginger instead of fresh. In the burger I also added shredded carrots, sambal olek, chopped scallions, finely ground almonds (just b/c I had some left over from another recipe), panko & just a few drops of sesame oil. We really didn't taste the ground almonds, just gave it a little texture. In the ginger-mayo, we added some pickle relish & minched jalapenos. Didn't have any sweet onions, so bloomed some red onion in rice vinegar to take the raw bite out of them. My husband (not me) broiled some pepper jack on his bread. I know, cheese w/salmon?! Whatever, he loved it & ate 3 of them.

This was good. The Mayonnaise was wonderful. I think I will try this with canned salmon the next time.

This was SO tasty. I had my doubts about the ginger mustard mayonnaise; it sounded like a very odd combination. But it really made the sandwich! I also added a little bit of panko breadcrumbs, and also added some raw spinach to the sandwiches in addition to tomato and onion. This is the best way that I've made salmon at home and I can't wait to make it again.

This is a good, easy, and quick recipe. I added about 3/4 teaspoon of vegetable oil to the burger mixture itself (along with breadcrumbs) to help keep it together.

Have always made with cooked salmon before. This was surprisingly tasty and very RICH. 3/4 # didn't look like much, but was plenty. I ground a little of the salmon (just in a mouli grater) and used it to bind the burgers. Sauce was Excellant!

My husband gave this 4 forks. He loved it -- while eating his burger, he told me three times how good it was! I added 1/2 Tablespoon breadcrumbs to bind the salmon. It held its shape and did not fall apart. Two thumbs up!

I used the burger ingredients as a marinade/glaze over salmon fillets served on croissants, and it went over very well with my family. I'll definitely make this again. :^)

This was delicious. I substituted ground ginger and it was still good, I can only imagine it must be that much better with the real thing. My burgers fell apart while frying, but I think it's because I didn't chop the salmon fine enough. Will grind it using my Kitchen Aid next time to make it the consistency of hamburger. Also, double the recipe of the mustard mayonnaise dressing because it's so yummy.

Tastey and fairly easy to make. This was my first attempt at salmon burgers so was apprehensive as to my ability to keep the patties together, but once you put it in the pan and start cooking they hold together nicely. I did add an egg to the mixture to help. My biggest problem was that there was not enough mayonnaise; next time I will make more. Served this with maple mashed sweet potatos (also on this site) for a wonderful change to what easily becomes the same-old salmon.

Wow. I made this last night and was very happy with the outcome. For such a simple recipe, the flavors are incredible. I served this with TANGY EGGPLANT, LONG BEANS, AND CHERRY TOMATOES WITH ROASTED PEANUTS (also on this site) and thought the two went together very well. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe tasted great and was fast and easy to make. My boyfriend who says he 'hates salmon' ate it up and asked when we were making it again. I accidently added the oil to the patties (instead of the pan) and they were still wonderful.

This is a great little weeknight dinner. Unlike the previous reviewers, I didn't find it necessary to add egg or binders to the salmon mixture. I did, however, accidentally add the 2 tsp. of oil to it instead of using it for pan frying. No big deal. I used a piece of salmon that had been frozen and mostly thawed and found that the partially frozen texture made it easier to chop finely. I also found that the mixture really didn't form into patties that held their shape. Not a problem, though, as I just got the pan really hot (added a bit of oil) and formed the burgers as I flopped them into the pan. They do cook quickly. My four year old even gobbled one up!

These burgers will be great on the grill this summer. Think I'll add an egg for "glue" and dice the onion as part of the mixture, for those little hands that let all the goodies fall out of the bun. Thanks for giving printer-access, much appreciated.

I've looking for a salmon burger recipe for a while now. I can't wait to make this dish.

Definitely too much ginger - replaced with 1 garlic clove in salmon mixture. Added honey (1/4 to 1/2 tsp.)to the mayonnaise to sweeten it up - make it more like a teryaki flavor. After modifying a few things, it's worth making. Using pre-ground salmon makes it less prone to fall apart.

A Chef from Mary Esther, Florida on 07/18/99 My Salmon Burgers turned out very well. I'm a Culinary Arts Graduate and I added a few ingredients to this recipe to assure that the burgers stayed together and were spicy enough. In addition to the regular ingredients I added, Fat free Parmesan Cheese, granulated garlic, used some egg white and very little bread crumbs and a little bit of Skim Milk. I also added some Red Pepper to taste. (Yum Yum)

The recipe was ok, but the salmon doesn't stick together so it can be kind of challenging to eat. I am not sure what could be used to make it stick together better. The flavor was good, but kind of bland for my taste buds which like a bit more spicy flavors. I would probably add something to add a little spice to it. I'm not sure what, though. Any suggestions??? :-)

My only suggestion would be to reducde the amount of ginger the recipe calls for (and I'm a ginger fan!). It was just a little to pronounced. Other than that my wife and I really enjoyed.
