This was recommended by a friend and tried it out for my fathers birthday. The taste was delectable like the recipes I got from www.gourmetrecipe.com and www.thesaladsite.com. You will find more beautiful and interesting recipes.

Cobb salad is pretty self-explanatory. In this recipe, all the basic ingredients are there to make a delicious salad. And it is delicious-- other than the dressing... The dressing is AWFUL! Just awful! Don't use it. It's sour and just plain yucky. Stick with a nice creamy ranch or another of your favorite dressings.

Well, I was just about to review this and then realized I forgot to put the blue cheese on it. Of course, the reason I bought the ingredients was to use up some blue cheese I had in the fridge. Nonetheless, it was awesome. Maybe we'll just have it again tomorrow night. Quick, easy. Don't know about healthy though....;-)

I love Cobb salad, but was disappointed in this version. Good news was that it was quick and easy, and I didn't miss the eggs or chicken, but the proportions seemed off. I ended up with a lot of bland iceberg lettuce and not much onion/scallion flavor. And why iceberg when there are so many more nutritious and delicious choices for greens? The biggest disappointment, however, was the dressing. It just didn't do it for us at all. I'm a big fan of the "Layered Cobb Salad" recipe on this site and will be returning to it as our Cobb Salad standard.

I've become obsessed with this salad. It's so yummy! I insist that we have it once a week. It is better than the cobb salads that I have eaten in restaurants. One modification for us. We are on a tight budget so I skip the heirloom tomatoes and just use regular tomatoes. Still delicious.

Made this as written last night. Very good. Next time, I'll sub in greek yoghurt for regular yoghurt (dressing was gorgeous but a bit thin) and the hardest, crumbliest blue I can find for the sticky, soft, gorgonzola I couldn't crumble as well as I would have liked. Will also add a bit more bacon. Bacon is good! This is a fabulous cookbook, btw. I'm going to enjoy working my way through it this spring and summer!
