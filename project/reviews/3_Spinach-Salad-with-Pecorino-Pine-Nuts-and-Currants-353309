I substituted the dried currants with dried blueberries, the result was delicious. Brought it to my sister's for dinner and my niece who refuses to eat nuts in a salad, devoured it, pine nuts and all.

Really easy. Everyone I've served it to liked it. Have substituted chopped toasted almond for the pinenuts.

Great. Store was out of pine nuts so I used slivered almonds. Served it with a pasta dish. Already make it more than once.

After reviewing the recipe and reading the comments I made this salad for a dinner party. I was a hugh hit. Raves all around. Great flavors with out having a heavy dressing. I will make this again

True this recipe was full of omissions/errors, but it's just a salad... easy enough to improvise. In fact I left out the sugar (thanks to the cook who posted the correct recipe) but I had a good quality balsamic vinegar with a slightly sweet taste, so it wasn't needed. Not a complicated recipe, and I loved the savory/sweet combination of flavors. This is was a hit at my house, and good way to get my family to eat more greens.

Thanks to the cook on 6/8/09 who gave the proportions from the magazine. This was simple and very tasty. I used mixed wild greens from my farm share and was very happy.

It DOES state in the TITLE "spinach" and Does state in the explanation "cheese', so there are the other two ingredients. Anyone who doesnt put these added ingredients with the four described ingredients isnt making a 'Spinach' salad-correct???

What's up with Epicurious? I got the weekly email touting four recipes and went to look at two of them that appealed and BOTH were incomplete, confusing recipes. I've been confident to try recipes from this site without test runs beforehand but will have to rethink that strategy! I'm an experienced cook and can recognize an error like not including oil in a salad dressing, but what about the neophytes? C'mon, Epi -- someone's asleep at the wheel!

this was quite funny really. my daughter (20) doesn't like to cook: "too confusing." I told her to copy ONE recipe from EPI.com and try it. Guess which one she picked? W/o seeing the recipe, i said, "honey, you forgot the oil." 'THERE WAS NO OIL in INGREDIENTS!' Didn't believe her. She had proof. we both laughed !

NO FORKS FOR THIS ONE!!! The obvious errors in this recipe are totally inexcusable. The person who submitted this recipe, and the person who hired that person, should both be fired! I have this same type of error in many other recipes. Having 40 years experience in the food service industry, I can work around such errors. But, what about the young cook who is trying to fix something special for a family member or "significant other"? They are doomed to failure before they even start cooking. Shame on you Epicurious! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!

Oh, for Pete's sake. This is a SALAD, not rocket fuel. Make a freaking spinach salad, dress it with balsamic and oil and throw some pine nuts etc. on it. What's going to happen???? Most people tweak recipes to their own taste anyway. As to "How is this possible?????", people make mistakes, big deal. If you were all perfect, you'd be able to figure out how to make a salad.

And doesn't it just make you mad, especially when it sounds like a good recipe. To leave out the main ingredients and the amounts is just plain sloppy work.

It's kinda tough to make a spinach salad without any spinach,it might be nice to include the cheese also. What's with the fritata

Rating: 0
How is it possible to leave out not only the amount of spinach, but the oil and the cheese as well? Somebody needs to be more careful!

I only see 4 ingredients listed - is this a typo?

It says "add cheese and toss" right at the end of the instructions.

This recipe has Pecorino in the title, but not in the recipe. There's mention of cheese and a fritata...so where are they in the ingredient list and in the prep section? Someone left a lot out of this recipe.

This is a fantastic salad. Here's the list of ingredients from the magazine: 1 1/2 tablespoons dried currants, 1 1/2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted, coarsely chopped, 1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, 1 1/2 teaspoons minced shallot, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 6 cups (packed) baby spinach leaves, Shaved Pecorino Romano cheese. We had it with some very simple pasta dish. Just great!

How can we whisk 5 ingredients in a bowl when only 4 are shown??? Something is lacking and doesn't taste right

I'm a little perplexed on the ingredient list as well. I used this as a rough estimate and made some changes. No pine nuts at the store so toasted up some walnuts instead. Decreased the balsamic vinegar to 1 TBSP and added 4 TBSP of flax seed oil and 2 TBSP of shredded parmesan to about 10 cups of fresh spinach. Substituted dried blueberrries for the currants--tastier and more moist. This recipe was a good starting point but needed a lot of tweaking to turn out well.

I'm perplexed - the preparation says to whisk first 5 ingredients but there are only 4 ingredients listed.

This was a fantastic dressing. Everyone loved it, so I will definitely be making this again. I would have to say if you aren't going to toast the pine nuts, don't bother making it.
