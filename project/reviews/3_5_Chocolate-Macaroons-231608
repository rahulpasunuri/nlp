I've never gotten such raves with any other cookie! They really are fantastic. Very light, with a super crisp exterior and very satisfyingly chewy (not just soft/gooey) center. My husband took some to work and informed me that they are requesting a weekly batch!

Hope for failed macaroons -- Put through food processor and use in chocolate chip cookies. Turned out beautifully.

These were brittle and not moist and chewy. Very disappointed - thrown in the garbage.

This was an extremely easy recipe! It only took me 30 minutes, plus they were moist and delicious.

These taste like brownies - regular brownies, but they're kosher for Passover. They were fab. Best of all, I could make them with the limited dishes and utensils I have for Passover.

These are good, but not your typical macaroon texture. They are a cross between meringue cookies, brownies, and macaroons. They taste good but if you are looking for that more gooey, sticky macaroon cookie these are very different.

Delicious! To be honest they barely made it to the cookie sheet, yum. Be very careful as not to very cook, 12 was perfect in my oven. Also didn't add additional chips, just melted a little extra. Quick, simple, easy and delicious! This one is a keeper!

Good flavor (from good chocolate and coconut) but I prefer a chewier, moister, round/dome shaped macaroon.

These are not like the macaroons I was expecting - the lumps you get in a can around Passover. Instead they are great crispy crunchy chocolate cookies.

this recipe was quite easy and quick. i found the cookies to have a ton of chocolate, however they are a huge success in the office!

The flavor was really good but they were too hard and brittle-- not chewy at all. Did I beat the egg whites too long? Bake them too long? (I followed the recipe on baking time) I also prefer a traditional stacked macaroon, so was a little disappointed in these flat cookies. If I could tweak the over-crisp factor, I would probably make them again because they're tasty and easy.

Easy to make and tasted delicious. A perfect blend of chocolate and coconut. I can't wait to make this again and impress all my friends.

This recipe is awsome especially if you use really fresh, moist coconut and substitute the 1 cup of mini chips for a very fine grade of dark chocolate. I have got nothing but rave reviews for these cookies.

These are so easy to make and are such a hit that I am printing this recipe for friends! I was a little short in the amount of chocolate but they still came out great!

I can often pass on cookies that I bake for my husband and daughter,therefore allowing me to lose the extra ten lbs. I packed on eating other rich fare over the holidays. Beware! I think I gained 5 back this evening!!

These are unbelievable! Not having any mini chips on hand left me using a block of 70% dark, which I melted entirely, since I don't care for chips of chocolate in macaroons. I also cut the sugar to half the amount. The result was a deeply chocolate, not too sweet macaroon that was to die for. Thank you Bev Heinecke for providing the inspiration and the recipe for a macaroon without corn syrup!

Make these for my birthday dinner - everyone was looking for seconds and thirds. Easy - will definately make again.

I made these for a potluck and they got rave reviews. However, I used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate which I chopped finely to fold into the batter.

Loved them! Easy and quick. Two people so far have asked for recipe, and another's requested I bring them to a party next week.

Easy,and they taste better the next day! Chewy on inside, light crust on the outside. May want to double recipe. Be careful not to overcook as they cook quickly, and you will be pleased!

The macaroons came out great. I took them out of the (gas) oven after 15 minutes, even though they were still gooey inside. This worked out well -- once the macaroons cooled down, the outside hardened enough so that the cookies were easy to handle yet the inside was still moist.

These were dry and burnt. I prefer a chewier macaroon.

These cookies are really tasty! It sounded too sweet so I replaced the sweetened coconut with organic unsweetened coconut and didn't add the rest of the chocolate chips at the end. They came out perfect!

I prefer a more traditiona, "stacked" macaroon. These flattened out, and I thought it was too much chocolate.

These were out of this world! Crispy/chewy, super chocolately. I made them twice in 3 days. No self-control!!
