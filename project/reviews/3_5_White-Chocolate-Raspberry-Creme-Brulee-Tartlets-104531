This is the best creme brulee I've attempted to make so far. I've made it without the crust and used a torch instead of the broiler. Rasberry pie filling with a little rasberry schnapps mixed in makes the perfect topping!

I thought the creme brulee was excellent. I only made the filling though. I garnished with raspberries and blackberries. Excellent.

I have made this several times and it will remain in my folder of must have recipes. I fooled around a little with amounts (doubling the crust and trippling the filling) and made a large tart. It is always a big hit!!

I'm really surprised by the lackluster reviews so far. For me this dessert turned out incredible--the ginger in the crust is brilliant, the texture of the custard is lovely, and the taste of it all together is sensational. The crust is so good that we were happy to have thick sides! By the way, you don't have to chill these overnight--3 hours or so is plenty. For a great presentation, place the tarts on large plates sprinkled with cocoa and powdered sugar, and sprinkle fresh raspberries both on the tarts and on the plates.

There is NO WAY that I will EVER make this recipe again! It was a huge amount of work (it takes at least two days to make, with all the chilling times, and it involves several steps) and then was hardly tasty enough to justify all that went into it. The other reviews are absolutely right - the crust-to-filling ratio is too high, especially with the double-thick sides. And the filling itself is just ok, nothing to rave about. All in all, it was fairly tasteless - the best part was the raspberries! I personally thought this recipe was an abysmal failure. However, to be fair, my husband did like it.

I wouldn't recommend double folding the crust on the outside it made the crust too thick. I also added a bit more chocolate than the receipe calls for.

The crust overwhelmed the filling and overall it was pretty tasteless.

Easy to make, also I did it as tart for 6 people.My friends were delighted with it ,we all thought it was a light dessert and the berries give it a little more quick to it. So enjoy making it and eat it.
