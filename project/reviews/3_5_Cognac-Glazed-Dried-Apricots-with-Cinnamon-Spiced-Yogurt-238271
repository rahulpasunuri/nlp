I was looking for a Greek-styled dessert to follow moussaka and this fit the bill perfectly. I used honey instead of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. So simple and delicious.

This was amazing! We had it for breakfast with french toast and it was a huge hit. I didn't have the orange peel, but because of the orange juice it didn't feel like it was lacking. It was so simple to make, this will go into regular breakfast rotation.

Good, but I have two suggestions to make it better: 1) caramelize those nuts, whichever they are; 2) be careful with orange peel  mine got a bit bitter.
