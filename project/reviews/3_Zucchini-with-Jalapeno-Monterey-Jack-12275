I used the flour, and enjoyed this-- how simple it was, the flavor, the way it didn't heat my kitchen up on an 85-degree humid day... I would ask that the recipe be reworded to say, spread slices in A Single Layer. I didn't and it took twice as long and of course, the bottom layer is cheeseless. But still very good. Next time I may do it the same way but layer cheese along with the first layer of zucchini. A make-again for us.

Great recipe! I cut the zucchini extra thick & added Hormel turkey pepperoni on top of the cheese. The pepperoni gave an extra kick to the recipe. Although microwave probably works as well I had the time & baked it instead @ 350 until the cheese was brown. a keeper! Amy :)

I love zucchini. I love jalapeno monterey jack cheese. However, I did not like the combination of those two. This was an easy dish to make though. I just wouldn't make it again because I didn't care for it.

I skipped the breadcrumbs, and just sliced up the cheese and placed it on top of the zucchini. I was a little dubious, but this was awesome. It made a great side dish with salsa-topped fish and spanish rice.

I was looking for some microwave-cooking recipes because we're without regular appliances at the moment due to a kitchen remodel. This recipe was so easy to prepare (even in my makeshift kitchen in a spare bathroom!) and tasted great to boot. As the other reviewer mentioned, it isn't fancy, but even my finicky husband liked it. I'd definitely make it again even under regular circumstances. I did omit the tossing-cheese-with-flour step, but we didn't miss that. It would probably be good with chopped tomatoes, corn, or onions if you wanted to jazz it up a bit.

Very easy and fast. I sprinkled in a little frozen corn. Not fancy, but healthy and taste good.
