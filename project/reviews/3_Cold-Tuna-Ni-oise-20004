Speaking of nastiness, who would cook tuna for 1 1/2 hours?

If this is too complex, then buy a TV dinner! This is a delicious recipe - light yet filling.

Hey Previous Reviewer, no one's forcing you to make this dish and I don't see it recommended for you, your kids, or your extended family. So if it doesn't agree with you, why don't you just open a flat of Cup O' Noodles which are quick and easy and your whole family can get in on the fun.

Looks good. But too complex for my purpose: family lunch. Not suitablfor a light lunch for a busy family including children.
