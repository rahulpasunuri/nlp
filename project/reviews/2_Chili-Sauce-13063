I'd rather eat Hormel chili from a can than this disaster.

Using this recipe as a base for some really hot sauce is excellent. I guess if you don't like real hot this is good. I added 2 jalapeno peppers sliced and 1 habenero sliced,to the mixture and let them all simmer.Mouth watering and belly warming.

I grew up on chili dogs from the Varsity in Atlanta--from whence comes this recipe. We'd die for these chili dogs--especially when you no longer live there. Have not made this, I admit. But I know it's good. It really does not taste like "traditional chili." There's is reason why high school reunions have the Varsity cater at least several times. But it is good! And I'm happy to have this recipe!

BORING!

I looked at this recipe and couldn't believe that there was no Chili powder to be added. I have a much better recipe by using catsup, tomato sauce, worcestershire sauce, ground beef, pepper and salt, chili powder and garlic. Yummy.

I added so much extra stuff that by the time I was done, it didn't look much like the original recipe. Because of that, I can't really give a great score. A real good recipe shouldn't require so much "fixing".

Great recipe. I made several additions which have made it a big hit - add tomato paste and brown sugar for starters, but most importantly, a lot of chili powder!

Good for a sauce not requiring chili spice. However, will return to my own receipe. We prefer a thiner sauce. I will add chili pepper, more tomato juice or beef broth in the event I make it again.
