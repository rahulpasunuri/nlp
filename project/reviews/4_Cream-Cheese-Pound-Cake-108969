This was wonderful - velvety texture, and a not-to-sweet, buttery flavor. This is an old recipe and the version I was familiar with used three (!!) sticks of butter, so I used three, and perhaps a quarter cup less sugar than called for. I also used a cake flour substitute (substituting a few Tbsps AP flour with cornstarch - next time I'll just buy cake flour) per the advice of previous reviewers. I made one last week for company and am making another this week for visiting family - it's just a perfect pound cake. Might play around with citrus zest or a bit of glaze next time.

I have been making this cake since I first saw the recipe in 2003. It always gets rave reviews from friends and family. I make a brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecan strusel and bake it with the cake. Using fresh ingredients, and a specialty vanilla extract will perfect this cake. I often have to make 3 cakes during the holidays to appease the kids and their friends. :)

This cake was merely good - not fantastic as all the reviews claimed (which did help me decide which pound cake I was going to make today). Comments - a stand mixer is going to make doing this easier than a hand mixer - easier on the cook and also, more control over the speed of the mixing. I found that instead of making the cake richer, the cream cheese cut into the awesome butteriness I usually associate with poundcake, and its also pretty bland. I've had great success and prefer, for instance, the Lemon Verbena poundcake that is somewhere here in epicurious land... Unlikely that I'll make THIS poundcake again. Its more effort than its flavor and texture deserve

This recipe yielded a pound cake with the right density and crust. I did find however that it was very sweet. I would definitely make it again, but would reduce the sugar by about 1/2 cup.

This pound cake is delicious!! I made two loaves, and reduced the baking time by just a couple minutes at each section, and they came out perfectly. I will definitely make this again.

Unbelievably good. I've made this several times and never get tired of it. The cold oven is essential. I always set my timer for at least 15 min. before suggested end-time and just keep testing it. It's the best pound cake ever. I've been a baker for 45 years and I must say--this beats any that I've ever made before.

Wow, was this a hit! It's a classic pound cake with a moist, tender crumb and wonderful flavor.

Rating: 4
This is one of my all time favorite recipes. Although it does take time and attention to adjust the baking temperatures throughout, it is worth the effort. It is a classic recipe, combining the texture contrast of golden brown crust and the soft, dense cake with the simple light flavor of the pound cake.

Rating: 4
Makes a moist, dense, delicious pound cake. Reminiscent of the Sara Lee pound cake, but without the bizarre chemicals. I divided the batter into 2 8x4 loaves and baked the same amount of time indicated in the original recipe. Only changes made were to increase vanilla to 2T (6t) and decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup. Improves on aging well-wrapped 1 day. Not at all dry or tasteless. Be sure to weigh your flour and do not overbake! I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
Really good. Like others, I made two loaf pans instead of the bundt pan. I followed the receipt exactly and I must say the result was pretty much flawless. We ate one of them plain and I topped on of them with confectioner's sugar thinned with lime juice while still warm. Both were great. Freezes really well too.

I've made this cake at least 30 times and it's always been wonderful! I've substituted half of the vanilla extract for lemon or almond. This cake has been mailed to relatives for the holidays too and today I just made it for the Pastor at my sons school as a thank you gift! Love it.

Rating: 4
This recipe is almost identical to the one I've been making for years, except that mine went into a cold oven and slowly rose to 275. The graduated increases make a HUGE difference - much more consistent results. Mine also uses 3 sticks of butter (I'm sure 2 would be sufficient, but what the heck...) and calls for cake flour rather than all purpose. For those folks who said this cake is dry or tough, try using cake flour. The texture is soft, yet dense, and smooth. I guess it has something to do with the protein content and gluten.... Anyway, happy baking!

In truth, I thought this cake wouldn't rise, given the lack of leavening agents. But I followed the directions, and the cake turned out wonderfully (and it did rise!) It was dense and moist with a tender crumb and lovely tang from the cream cheese. Like others, I added my own personal touch - a marmalade swirl. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe turned out perfectly with the classic poundcake texture and rich buttery flavor. I tweaked it slightly by using 3 tsps of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of almond extract. My colleagues at work devoured it.

Everyone loved this cake! I replaced the vanilla with the zest and juice of half a smallish orange and a tsp of almond extract. It wasn't difficult at all! It also wasn't too fussy, since at one point someone accidentally turned the oven down to 250 during the last hour and it still turned out fantastic.

This recipe produced enough batter for two loaf- style pound cakes. I cooked them for only 45 minutes once the oven was increased to 300 degrees. The low temp and slow cooking time made a rather level cake, something I am not used to for a loaf pound cake. I added the zest of one navel orange, 1/2 t. orange extract, and a handful of dried cranberries. Perfection!

This is the last pound cake recipe that you need to read. It is absolutely perfect. I read the reviews and got so muddled, that I decided to stick to the recipe  hard as it was. I served it to my friends and everyone declared that it was simply the best pound cake that they had ever tasted! I used 2 tbs lime juice & 2 tsp lime zest instead of vanilla, and glazed the warm cake with a glaze of 5 tbs confectioners sugar and 1 tbs lime juice. I cant wait to make it again. Ignore all comments about the wait from the 30 minute meal crowd. This cake is for the pros. It was still slightly warm after 3 hrs, which took it off the charts!

Would give it 3.5 stars if I could. This recipe replicates my late-gradmother's pound cake closely, for which she was known well. I add lemon zest and almond extract occasionally for a change in flavor. No accompaniments are necessary as this cake stands well alone. One warning: don't let the cake cool too long in the pan to avoid sticking.

Soooo much sugar. I can still feel the sugary residue in my mouth! Even though I added layers of fresh starberries and preserves, nothing could salavage this overly sugary dessert.

AWESOME-MADE IN TWO LOAF PANS. DOSE ANYONE KNOW, CAN YOU FREEZE THEM?

Altho a bit of a pain to babysit, it was worth it. I served it with strawberries and whipped cream and wish I hadn't. The cake is best on its own - simple perfection. Anything extra is gilding the lily. My only complaint is that the cake was hard to get out of the pan - I've never had that happen with a pound cake. But I'll definitely make it again and again. My son took half of it to the beach with 3 friends and said he doubted it would survive the 4-hour drive.

I made this as a plain pound cake with a tunnel of strawberry jam and cinnamon. And as a chocolate pound cake by substituting 1/4 of the flour for cocoa and adding chocolate chips and pecans. I think the plain one was a little bland and the chocolate one had a terrific brownie like texture, though quite heavy. This cake will keep, covered, for quite a few days.

This is one of my favorite recipes BUT i actually use three sticks of butter, 2 t of vanilla and at the end, just before pouring batter into the pan, i add 18 oz of chocolate chips! Additionally, I simply cook it in a preheated oven, set at 350, for 1 hour and 45 to 50 minutes. Absolutely the best, never fails, moist and flavorful.

I sliced half of this cake and fanned it out around a golden platter, added a bottle of lemon curd to the middle, tied it up with clear cellophane and a golden bow and it was a HUGE hit as a gift for family. It looked beautiful, and, since I only used half, it made up 2 gifts. I had made it once before, so I know it is as delicous as it is beautiful. One note: I checked mine after 35 minutes at 300 and it was done.

This was a labor-intensive, way too sweet cake. It looked pretty and was very moist but with the time invested, I could have made something much more palatable.

Rating: 4
I have made this MANY times. I have varied it by doing the following: holding a litle reserve batter, adding a little more cream cheese to this batter, and then adding fresh berries to this. I pour a sufficient amount of batter into the bottom of the pan to completely cover PLUS allow me to make a little tunnel. Then I make a tunnel in the bottom batter. I then add the batter that I've added additional cream cheese PLUS berries to (into the tunnel). Then I top off with the remaining *normal* batter. I bake as recommended in the recipe. After it has cooled, I mash some more of the fresh berries. I put them into a pan and boil, stirring constantly, over a low flame, to reduce them. After they have reduced down by about l/4, I pour (while still hot) over the top of the pound cake). This soaks into the pound cake. I serve after it has cooled again. YUM! It is fantastic. Not another "boring" pound cake at all. I take this often as a dish to parties and everyone always begs for the recipe.

Yum, Yum, Yum. Like the cook from S.F., I made this because I was looking for a recipe for my Cathedral Cake Pan. It is a perfect fit! I had no problems getting it out and it looks beautiful.

Am making again this weekend.

It's perfect. I stumbled across it when I was looking for more recipes for my Williams Sonoma cathedral pan, which it fits into (and pops out of) perfectly. This cake with lightly sweetened strawberries and whipped cream in our new household hands-down favorite.

Perfection is all I have to say. For 20 years I have been faithful to my mom's recipe but the last couple of times I made it, I didn't like it at all. So, in my search for a new recipe, I tried this - made a test one first for my family and couldn't believe how good it was. Moist and flavorful. This is now my new pound cake recipe I will pass on to everyone!!

Completely followed the recipe - and loved it! Very flavorable, and just the right texture to have with coffee. (If you are counting calories - forget it!) I would not serve this as an after dinner desert for a sit down dinner - it is just not that kind of cake - but will gladly have it for breakfast. Next time, I will try some variations as indicated by past reviewers.

I love this recipe! I have added my own "signature" to this cake. I reserve some batter and add some extra cream cheese and some berries. I fill the bundt pan half way, make a hollow place with a spoon. Add this into the tunnel I made, then add the rest of the plain batter. It really adds to this "plain" cake. Sometimes I also reduce some berries and pour it over the top. mmmmmmmmm

Fantastic recipe: easy, fast and DELICIOUS! 3 days later, it's still moist yet with that distinctive heavy pound cake texture. I baked it in two loaf pans (cut down the baking times by about 5 minutes at each stage) and took one loaf with me to a dinner party - loaves travel well! At the dinner party I served it with a chocolate ganache sauce (semi-sweet chocolate chips melted into whipping cream). I've been eating the other loaf slice by slice for breakfast ...

This cake was very well received! The cream cheese made it moist without being too greasy. I substituted vanilla for Grand Marnier & added 2 tsp. orange zest, & that really helped to balance some of that heavy richness in the cake. Then I just glazed it w/ a simple icing sugar/orange juice whisked together. Oh, & splitting it into two loaf pans works just as well, & it bakes a little quicker.

I have yet to taste the cake because I am letting it rest for day to let the flavors meld - i added lemon rind and juice. But I had trouble with the baking time - after an hour at 300, it was still mushy and not at all golden. I ended up leaving it in for almost two hours at 300. It could be that my oven needs to be calibrated, but i wouldn't think it was off that much. Anybody else have this experience?

This was my first attempt at a poundcake and everyone who tried this loved it. I made it as written using an egg substitute for the eggs to try to cut a little bit of fat and cholesterol and the cake was still wonderful. I bought all of this cream cheese at Costco and wondered what to do with it and I was delighted to find this easy and yummy recipe. I served it with sweetened strawberries and whipped cream but we loved it on it's own, too. This recipe is a keeper! I will never buy another poundcake when it's this easy (and better) to make myself. The cake kept very well and we still enjoyed it 4 days later.

This is a great basic cake recipe--good to start out with and make lots of changes to suit different occasions. I made it the first time last week, and I thought it was boring on its own but tasted wonderful with a scoop of ice cream. Yesterday I made it for a potluck at work today, adding chocolate chips. Got lots of good reviews, but was VERY sweet and heavy! Next time I do that I'll cut down on the sugar. But overall, a good recipe to have on hand. Would love to add different things, like bananas, apple, coconut...

This is the best pound cake recipe ever. It is delicious and easy to make if you are a patient baker. I have made it 4 times and shared the recipe with 4 friends. It keeps fresh for a while and it is delicious with chocolate fondue because it is firm and won't crumble like other butter poundcakes. It will try a variation this weekend - I'm going to add frozen blueberries. Yum...

I loved this elegant but simple cake. I think it stands on it's own without ice cream or whipped cream. I did add mini chocolate chips when I made it. Next time I want to use rum to flavor it. I liked the baking process. It was your photograph of the cake that made me want to make it.

This is a wonderful pound cake and it serves a lot of people. I made it twice this holiday season. In order to make it a little more festive, I added nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and allspice to the batter. Then, I topped it with a warm caramel sauce. It was great. In spring and summer I'll probably top it with fresh berries and whipped cream.
