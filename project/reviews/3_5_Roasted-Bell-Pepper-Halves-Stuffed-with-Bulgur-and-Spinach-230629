Excellent flavors! I did add a little Italian sausage for the satisfaction of my carnivorous side. I did find the cooking times too long, the peppers were way over cooked and mushy. The next time I will most likely cut the time at least in half! Nice and hearty on a cool, rainy day!

My family loves this recipe. I use a little less goat cheese because that's our preference. We also make it with cooked brown rice instead of Bulgur wheat because of a family member's gluten free diet. It's good both ways!

I decided I didn't want to have stuffed peppers, but I thought that the filling sounded just like I wanted as a side dish for a simply roasted chicken (with lemon and garlic). So I "deconstructed" the recipe. Rather than roast peppers in the oven, I fire-roasted them on my gas stove-top. I put the filling in a casserole (using less feta since this was to be a side dish). Before topping with the feta, I laid out strips of the fire-roasted pepper. I really loved the result, although it wasn't as pretty as I had hoped. When I do it next time, I'll eliminate the fire-roasted peppers and just make the filling. To my surprise, the peppers seemed to create the dryness reported by some other reviewers. On it's own, the filling was nicely moist. I did use medium bulgur. The coarse bulgur probably needs a bit more water.

Great meal - especially if you have lots of peppers from your fall garden harvest. I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts and added 2 ounces of swiss cheese mixed into the bulgar mix. For my husband's pepper I added italian sausage. The bulgar does take longer to cook if it is course. I simmered it for about 40 minutes on the stove with more than 2 cups of water and the cover on. It turned out great. We are going to make this meal often.

Your success with this recipe is going to depend on the coarseness of your bulgur. Coarse bulgur will not be cooked thoroughly using the steeping method described. If in doubt, simmer (rather than steep) the bulgur in two cups of water until tender and drain off any excess water. I used fine bulgur and followed the recipe as written and thought it was wonderful! My only substitution was sliced almonds instead of pine nuts.

This looks like a nice change for stuffing red peppers. I like the idea of adding extra to it, so shall try to add some fresh rocket, and of course red pepper flakes. Norm, I make the stuffing with spanish rice and lamb, but since I am cutting down on meat, this will be an added change to my summer cooking.

This is a great recipe: easy, yummy and healthy too. I did substitute the feta cheese with 1% fat cottage cheese and it was still great. I would recommend adding a little red chilli powder or crushed black pepper to the stuffing for those who like a little bite. Next time I am planning on trying it as a baked side dish without stuffing the peppers. I would try chopping another pepper into the bulgur mix and baking it.

LOVE this!!! I have made it 4 different times - once as a main dish for a 'meat' eater and he loved it. I've changed it every time b/c I always forget some of the spices, but no matter what I do, it comes out so tasty every time. I love the combination of flavors and love how healthy and hearty it is!!

General flavors were good, but on the whole this is a rather disappointing recipe. I thought the liquid for bulgur was too much and indeed it was. The stuffing was very mushy, yet when the peppers they were dry and would have benefited from a light sauce.

These were really good. I used dried dill (about 1/3 the amount) but otherwise did everything the same. We love stuffed peppers and these were a fresh take on them for us. Great combo of flavors.

I was disappointed in the texture of the bulgur. After siting in the boiled water for 30 min, it was not tender and didnt' get any more tender in part due to my error in not keeping the dish covered in the oven. (I covered it overnight in the fridge with plastic wrap before cooking it the next night, but th ebaking instructions do not say "covered". Perhaps this would have steamed the bulgur and made it more tender. In any event, the dish was very unappetizing in appearance and texture. Flavor was good, but I was so busy trying not to break a tooth that it spoiled any enjoyment.

I completely changed this according to what I had on hand: arugula instead of spinach, no dill, no mint, quinoa instead of bulgar, and the cheese was a mix of parmesan and fontiago. Also I stuffed it into Hungarian wax peppers because they are the best peppers for stuffing! It turned out delicious! But the peppers were a bit too soft, you don't need to bake them for more than 20 minutes.

I thought this was going to be a bit too exotic honestly--and I was making it for myself--but in the end I was eating the stuffing plain alone before I even stuffed the peppers! Great flavors--I'm glad I tried it.

Great recipe that I served as a side dish. I used chicken broth for the water and added shallots and garlic.

Saved by the reviews once again! I used half of the bulgur and feta and kept the other stuffing ingredients the same. It was the perfect amount to stuff 4 large bell pepper halves (I used orange) and the flavor was bold and yummy. Go lightly on the feta sprinkled on top it's better mixed in the filling and the peppers that had less looked more appealing. I'm craving this already.

This was great- a little time consuming but overall yummy veggie dish. I used quinoa instead of bulgar to make the dish a bit lighter and ended up using goat cheese and feta. yum- next time i would increase the amount of spices a bit and use more spinach.

Very tasty. Made as is, except increased the amount of pine nuts.

A surprise hit in a household a little skeptical of stuffed peppers and anything made with bulgur...but we're always on the lookout for heathy and tasty dishes, and this one made the grade. I was perhaps more generous with olive oil, salt, pine nuts, and feta...which I'm sure added to the flavor

Our household is always on the lookout for heathy and tasty vegetarian dishes--and this makes the grade...despite our skepticism about both bell peppers and anything with bulgur. I followed the recipe pretty closely, perhaps used a bit more olive oil, pine nuts, salt and feta than called for, which may have added flavor. A surprise hit.

It was very good with following changes: saute 2 shallots instead of pine nuts twice bigger than indicated amount of herbs for same amount of bulgur for bulgur use 1 cup of water or broth for 1 cup of bulgur Roast whole peppers, turning them once I've made it many times already with and without peppers for breakfast or as side dish - very tasty and flavorfull. One more thing - it should be eaten fresh. Leftovers resemle the Whole Foods ready salads :).

Mindful of the comment about flavorlessness, I used "Near East" couscous with pinenuts in the filling, plus some toasted almonds. I also sauteed some Vidalia onion and a clove of garlic with the yellow bell pepper. I liked it.

To add taste, use vegetable or chicken broth instead of water for the craked wheat. Ii is a great side dish.

Can't hold a candle to regular stuffed bell pepper with rice and meat. This is totally tasteless
