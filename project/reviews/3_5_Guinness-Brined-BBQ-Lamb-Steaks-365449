All in, this was a fantastic recipe. I did the brine, made the rub and the BBQ sauce. The star anis is a must in my opinion, so nice with lamb. I made a few substitutions. I used a roast instead of steaks, the oven in a covered casserole dish instead on the BBQ (it is winter right now), tomato paste instead of ketchup for the BBQ sauce - way better and not so sweet, I do this for all recipes that call for ketchup. If I were to do it again I would cut all salt in half, except for the brine, which is by definition salty. The rub and the sauce can sand on the flavor of the other ingredients without promoting heart palpitations. I actually ended up adding 2 tbsp of coco powder to the BBQ sauce after I finished it, mostly to take down the saltiness, and it worked like a charm and provided even more richness. I got the idea from a chili recipe I posted on Epi. It seems to be a great compliment to smoky flavors of chili and chipoltle.

I ordered lamb steaks just to try this recipe out. It was delicious, but a bit too salty for my taste - my own fault - I probably brined it too long. Easy, great flavour, and the BBQ Sauce is amazing. My guests loved it. Only thing I'll change is to brine it for a shorter time - I did the full 6 hours. I think 3 hours would be sufficient.
