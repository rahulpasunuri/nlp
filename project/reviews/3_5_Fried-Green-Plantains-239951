In may be sacrilege (but my health/fitness-guru Cuban neighbor taught me this so it can't be too bad): Instead of the first frying process, just cut the tips off the plantains and microwave them until the skin splits and they peel fairly easily (after cooling). Then proceed with the rest of the recipe. The results are VERY good and you skip a bunch of the fat.

Yum - my plantains yellowed before I could get around to frying them up, so I skipped the garlic and made them exactly as described in the recipe. Husband suggested toppings next time . . . serrano ham? Can't wait!!

Used the garlic water tip. Delicious! The next night I prepared sweet yellow plantains the same way, but subbed coconut oil (and, uh, nixed the garlic). Delicious again!

Made two batches...one as printed, and one using previous reviewer's hint. The previous reviewer's advice about dipping them in chopped garlic/water...OUT OF THIS WORLD!! The recipe alone as printed was just ok. I must disagree with this part: "(Plantains will not spatter.)" because I have the burns on my arm to prove it wrong, ouch!

Good, not great. Perhaps the plantains were too ripe. I would try this again.

Tostones are definitely one of those wonderful treasures of Puertorrican cooking. You should try basting them with crushed garlic before the second frying. The flavors just blow you away

We love tostones! My girlfriend is Puerto Rican and introduced them to me. We use a press, and don't have a problem with it, it turns out great rounds. We also make a "Russian with a PR twist" dressing (mayo, ketchup and garlic mojo)to dip them in!

Tostones are one of our favorite side dishes! Tip: I own a tostone flattener, and never use it. I find that the best way to flatten them before the second frying, is to put the section of plantain between 2 pieces of parchment paper, and to squish it with a coffee mug (like the standard cheap, promotional type coffee mugs that have a slightly rounded bottom...) The size and thickness of each flattened tostone comes out perfectly, and the parchment paper prevents the plaintain from sticking to the mug! Also, if you're trying to flatten the plantain and it's crumbling, fry it longer. They need to be cooked all the way through to flatten properly.
