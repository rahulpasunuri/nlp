Easy and so tasty! Cut recipe in half for main course for two. Added a bit more red curry paste, and lime wedges. Best way to cook mussels, IMO.

You get exactly what you hope for with this one-- delicious mussels in red curry broth-- yum! I served with lime wedges.

Who knew that making mussels would be this easy - and delicious. Followed the recipe, but added more curry paste. You spend more time shopping than you do cooking and it came out very impressive!

A favorite for years. Added a shot of fish sauce, a sprinkle of brown sugar, and to serve, a few wedges of lime. Superlative as always, restaurant worthy and comes together so quickly.

It had been several years since I made this that I forgot how good it is. One of my husband's favorites! For the two of us, I make as listed except I only use one can coconut milk and one pound mussels.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is always a hit... I have replaced the mussels with Shrimp and King Crab Legs (cut in small pieces) and served over noodles. It was nice the way the crab shells held the sauce...YUM!!!!

Delicious, everyone had seconds, didn't need crusty bread since everyone drank up the broth.

Excellent! If it has coconut milk and curry paste, it's awesome. The broth really compliments the flavor of the mussels and is good enough to eat on its own. Plus it's super easy to make!

Rating: 4
Very good! Agreed with previous reviewers that is it good with a little cane sugar, lime juice, and dry white wine. Can also use a little more garlic, ginger, and curry paste...but either way, very good.

Yum! This was the first time I made mussels and it was delicious. I highly recommend this recipe. My husband is less of a mussel fan so we replaced one lb of the mussels with tiger prawn. We ate it Belgian style with lots of crusty bread to soak up the broth :)

This is one of my favorite recipes on the site. I also double the amount of garlic and ginger and use tons of the curry paste, but it's easy and absolutely delicious. Never any leftovers.

this is super easy and delicious. I sauteed some shallots in butter, then double garlic/ginger, a squirt of lemongrass paste, 3tb of fish sauce, a2 ts of palm sugar, 2 tb of panang curry paste, and thai basil instead of cilantro. I used 2lbs of mussels, and 1 lb of shrimp. It tasted authentic to me, and I will definitely make it again.

These were AMAZING. Next time, I will add a hot pepper for a little kick, but this recipe is absolutely delicious just as it is, too.

This is super easy, quick and tastes absolutely wonderful. I have served this many times and it never has failed to please. I have even doubled the broth, thickened it with cornstarch and served over rice or with pasta.

This is a great mussels recipe that I've made several times. If you can handle spiciness, double or triple the Thai curry paste, you will thank me later when your dipping your French or sourdough bread into the broth.

Very good recipe. Easy and delicious. I added just a bit of fish sauce and some roasted red chili paste. We will make this again for sure. We had leftover sauce and I served it over some cod the next day - that was excellent too!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet! I have been making this since I found the recipe in June... I just started cooking and this was one of the first things I every made... and it was super easy and better than most professionally cooked mussels!

I thought this was exceptional. It was my first attempt at mussels. It was easy and delicious. My boyfriend, who said previously that he doesn't like mussels, said it is the best dinner I've ever cooked. The only changes I made were to add chicken broth to the liquid in order to thin it out a bit. I thought it looked to thick with just the coconut milk. I also added fish sauce per other reviews.

It just doesn't get better than this!!! Great recipe that is a hit every time we make it. You can do so many thing with this such as add other seafood and/or serve with bread, rice or pasta. A most definite keeper!!!

this dish is fantastic! i made it a meal by following other comments...added jumbo shrimp to the pot at same time as mussels then topped this over some vermicelli noodles and it was like a thai noodle soup. DELICIOUS!!

Awesome. Used basil instead of cilantro cause that is what I had and it was perfect. We used spoons to eat the rest of the sauce as soup!

Excellent dish! I was only cooking for 2, so I halved everything except the garlic, ginger, and curry paste. Added some fresh basil and 1/2 Tbsp fish oil. It turned out great!!

I make this again and again. It's easy, just use tons of garlic and ginger. Raves every time. After the mussels are gone we often reuse the curry to make potatoes or chicken.

Delicious! Made this with olive oil vs. butter and light coconut milk and came out terrific. Used fish sauce instead of salt and added extra curry paste for more heat.

SO GOOD! This recipe is one I will definitely keep and use often- very versitile. I used mussels, but also added some shrimp for variety- would be good with scallops too. I did make a few modifications- but I am sure it is great "as written" too. I added a few stalks of lemongrass, 1/2 cup white wine, about 2 T. palm sugar (could use brown sugar) and 1 T. fish sauce to the broth (before adding seafood). Just fabulous!!

LOVED IT. Made sauce as written, but couldn't find mussels, so used butterflied shrimp and a Florida Lobster tail that I caught the day before. (Yeah!!) YUM! I did forget the salt at first, needs that. Will make again!

I made this with shrimp, and it really was superb. It needed more fish sauce and some brown sugar.

wow! I made it with scallops, and will try shrimp next time as we don't care for mussels. Double the suace and freeze it: one of the best sauces I have ever had!

I have been using this recipe for years and just thought of it again today for a summer BBQ meal. I made up the sauce in advance and heated it on the side-burner of the BBQ (about time to dust it off!) and stirred in clams (no decent mussels at the fish store today) as we mingled with guests. We ladled the clams into small bowls and served with baguette slices as a pre-BBQ appetizer - a great hit. One warning - thai red curry pastes seem to vary in intensity. The one we currently have is VERY hot so I cut it back a bit with good results. Another bit of advice: this recipe makes a huge amount of sauce. Today, I used about 2 lb clams and a half recipe of sauce (plenty). You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Prepared this with frozen New Zealand green-lipped mussels on the half shell. Savoy brand is my favorite choice of coconut milk because it has a thick, rich layer of cream on top. It was for that reason that I used Kitchen Basics Seafood stock that I purchased at Trader Joe's, in place of the 2nd can of coconut milk. Also used fish sauce to taste in place of salt. A crusty, sweet baguette was wonderful for sopping up the sauce. Another variation on this recipe would be to use basil, and thai palm sugar in the sauce and serve over rice noodles, or jasmine rice.

Awesome! My "significant other" won't eat mussels, so I sauted scallops and mushrooms instead and used that in place of the mussels. I can see this one being a household regular...

This has become a "keeper" in our house. One of our guests has described the meal as klller mussels. Don't omit the cilantro or ginger, though.

This is the best mussel recipe ever! I've made it at least a dozen times as my friends keep asking me to make it over and over. I've made it with regular coconut milk and lite, but prefer the regular. I've also used the base for a seafood soup and it's wonderful.

Wonderful recipe. We doctored it up by adding fresh lemongrass. It is great over sticky rice.

Amazingly easy recipe with big payoff! Wonderful colors and smells, everyone was ready to eat before this was plated. I plated for my spice-loving friends last, after I added a bit more curry. Served over pasta with ample toasted bread.

Fantastic!!! I followed the recipe then removed mussels and simmered the sauce down to reduce it. Served it over rice. What a taste treat.

Made a variation of this recipe and a similar one found on Epicurious (July 2002). I sautéed mushrooms, garlic, ginger and tomatoes in butter and chicken stock then added Lite Coconut milk (2 cans) and nearly 1 cup of chopped cilantro/basil. Used green curry paste (nearly 2 tablespoons) as was what I had on hand, fine substitute, but would have preferred red. Cut lemon grass into large pieces to flavor the sauce (and be easily removed). Also added the juice of 1/2 of lime. Steamed 2 pounds of mussels and served with rice and fresh springrolls (via takeout!). A lot of food for 2 people.

Rating: 3
Fabulous! I used a little over 2 lbs of mussels, and reduced the coconut to only 1 can (and used a lite version - it tasted great!) I also increased the cilantro and garlic a little bit. Add some good bread, and what a meal for 2 hungry people! Will definately make again.

Excellent. I couldn't find fresh ginger, so I used crystallized ginger. One can of coconut milk and 4 pounds of mussels. My husband loved the dish. Do increase the curry paste slightly.

If you've never cooked Thai food this will definitely motivate you to cook more of it. The red curry paste,coconut milk and cilantro give this dish all it's flavour. The seafood you use doesn't matter too much. Unfortunately if you're used to Thai food this recipe tastes exactly like every other dish that uses coconut milk and curry (and there are alot of them!). I used the sauce over peanut encrusted scallops on a bed of Basmati rice. Looks great but next time I'll add some fish sauce, lemon juice and maybe basil.

Rating: 4
Truly superb sauce. I made it once with the mussels and got rave reviews and a request for a repeat performance. Couldn't obtain mussels last time so I poached 3lbs of chicken breast fillets in the sauce, and it was also wonderful. Lots of requests for the recipe!

Rating: 4
This recipe is awesome! One of my husband's favorites. I prefer to saute the garlic and ginger without the tomatoes, then add the tomatoes just prior to mixing in the coconut milk (I only use one can of coconut milk), and serve it over rice rather than with french bread.

Rating: 4
I LOVE this recipe!! Not only it is easy and quick, but it is so versatile. I often poach salmon or halibut in the leftover sauce and serve it with the mussels and/or clams. Great on a bed of spinach as I don't eat rice.

Rating: 4
One of my favorite receipes. A couple of suggestions - I've cut the butter and coconut milk in half and changed the seafood to include 2 pounds of mussels, 2 pounds of calamari and 1 pound of peeled and deveined rock shrimp (regular shrimp can be substituted if you can't find rock shrimp). Makes a wonderful seafood dinner for 8. I serve it with an Asian cucumber salad topped with chopped peanuts, and lots of french bread. Always a winner.

My favorite dish. This mussel dish is better than sex! Well... almost better. Used light coconut milk and 1/2 the butter and it still tasted quite rich. If you serve it as a causal dish, try eating with your hands-- it's a sensuous experience!

Delicious. I used mussels and prawns and will add clams next time. Red curry paste lasts years in fridge - first time users beware , it is very spicy. Lots of sauce left for another meal.

I made this as an opening course for 12 people at a Thai dinner party, and served in its own sauce with French Bread. It was absolutely fabulous, not to mention incredibly easy to make- a no-fuss, delicious first course.

Just wonderful...I was so pleased with the ease of this recipe, and the flavor is terrific. I think the butter could be cut by a tablespoon or two and you wouldn't miss it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter (threw in an extra teaspoon of red curry, tho), and it was just great. I am going to try it again, only with a pound of shrimp, a little less butter and some lite coconut milk instead. Oh, and the bread is a must! Though I also made jasmine rice for this, and that was a nice accompaniment. Also steamed some asparagus for this, too.

Made this for my family at one Christmas and was a big hit. It was a change from the ordinary dish made with white wine. Loved it

Rating: 4
So incredibly good. You're right, ht - the sauce is great on its' own. There was so much of it, I used it twice for leftovers - once on penne, once on rice, after the mussels were gone. Both tasted great! (I made it with a prepared red curry simmer instead of the paste, as that was what was available - I used a lot, since it was diluted.) One of my signature dishes too!

Mmmmmm. I served this a the first course to the main course of ginger beet risotta and honey hoisen salmon steaks. The sauce is so good who needs the mussels! This will become one of my trademark dishes!

This is the first recipe I tried from epicurious.com - I increased the volumes by 50% to serve 6 people - everyone raved ! I did choose to 'cut' the coconut milk with white wine to reduce the viscosity. Serve with a light zinfandel for a great combination.

Amazing flavor, even using canned curry paste, which made the recipe really quick and easy. I also used New Zealand greenlips, which are far superior to the blue mussels -- very plump and tasty, not to mention easier for the cook. I've cooked this for clients and students and it hasn't failed to impress yet.

Wonderful dish. It was really a big surprise. Good flavor, lots of curiousity and easy to make. Add a little more curry paste. Advise: When you buy the mussles don't let the fish monger close them in a plastic bag. The mussle will die and open.

Great, but a little bland if you stick to the recipe. I doubled the curry and added extra salt. Would also suggest sauteing the ginger and garlic BEFORE adding the tomatoes. Goes really well with beer!

Delicious! Quick and easy to make -- a great "Friday night in front of the fire dinner". I used one can of light coconut with one can of regular for a little lighter dish.

The only suggestion I have is that only one can of coconut milk is necessary. I add extra coriander and sometimes more curry paste or a few hot peppers for those who like really spicy meals
