Ok here is the deal with this. It is easy...and tastes great. the spices seem to help keep the pork moist. this has been a hit every time I have made it. It is a weeknight keeper...

This was a let down. It was easy but nothing to rave about. Will not make this again.

ok with store bought this came out the best pork chops I have ever done. Was easy as well and I had everything in house....

I gave this four forks for the combo of speed and taste - it's fast AND delicious. It helps that I had excellent local natural pork chops to start with which were the best pork chops I've seen in my life! (I'll be putting in a big order with that farm this spring) But I would still try this with store-bought chops and expect good results. Know what you like - if you don't like cumin this may not be for you.

This is a great recipe. We do pork chops in many different ways. The flavoring is essential simplicity. The toasted cumin- coriander seed & garlic rub is very conducive to pork. Coupled with fresh coriander from the garden and lime, it's perfect!

I used cumin and coriander already toasted and crushed, which made the recipe much easier! and of course I used garlic that was already minced as well. Very tasty. My friend loved it as well.

I love the spices however this was not good. The meat because it wasn't braised with fluid in a pan was tough, Yuck

Such a simple recipe and so good. Followed the recipe to the letter. This turned out great. A nice change from regular pork chops.

This was spectacular, I grilled boneless pork chops with this rub and it received oohs and aahs from my dinner guests. Terrific! I will absolutely make this again, works fantasticly on the grill. Nice too because I grill all winter, this only takes 15 minutes of standing outside in the snow.

Nice, Very Nice. Easy, fast and tasty. It was grilled rather than doing on the cooktop. I served this with a cous cous flavored with sauteed chick peas & walnuts and then some sliced black olives added at the end. No leftovers from my family (need I saw more?)

Fantastic recipe - the hubster LOVED it - definitely a nice change from applesauce and cabbage! I added some red and yellow peppers to the pan while I was cooking - GREAT complement to the texy-mexy flavors. Next time I make it, though, I think I'm going to add something to the pan juices and make a sauce (beer? cream? not sure ... ) to me, having a nice sauce drizzled over the meat was the only thing missing. Oh - and instead of serving with polenta, I roasted some potatoes (sweet potatoes would be good, too) quartered and tossed with olive oil, S&P and chilli powder.

This recipe was fabulous. The crunch of the spices, the tenderness of the chop, plus the speed and ease of preparation makes this recipe a keeper. I made extra spice mix and put it in an empty spice bottle for use a little later. I'm doing the low-carb thing, so I did not serve this dish with polenta. I served it with a side salad and I made what I called a Three Lily Compote. It's made with red onions, sweet onions, shallots, red wine vinegar, and just a touch of honey. The sweetness of the onion with the savory spices from the pork chop set off by the lime and cilantro.... Well I have just two words: YAA HUMMM

This is great with the addition of 1/2 t. of chili powder, and a minced garlic clove. I also grilled them instead of pan-frying. MMMMmmmmmmm!

If you like cumin, then you'll like this dish. I'm not really a fan but I would make it again only because it's quick to getting a flavored pork chop (versus just S/P). But I think there are better recipes using pork chops that are just as quick to put together.

I would definitely make this dish again. We just loved it because it was so flavorful! I didn't have any coriander or lime, but it was still great. Next time I'd like to make it according to the recipe and see how it turns out.

What is this about pork chops?

Rating: 3
We really liked these pork chops quite a bit, and I'll definately make them again! I made it just as called for, and they turned out very well. I only gave them three forks just because nothing has yet compared to my husband's grilled pork chops marinated in seasonings and bourbon. I made them with the suggested polenta, but since I am from the South, I haven't figured out why polenta is any better than grits. I think that I'll just make potatoes next time.

Not too good. Dry, and crunchy bits get stuck in your teeth. It tasted like pork chops dipped in gravel. Don't waste your time with this one.

I made this recipe verbatim. Do it. It is delicious in it's simplicity. In more day to day cooking I use both whole seeds and the ground spices. This is definitly a dish which benefits the roasting of whole seeds. The fresh lime and coriander add a nice compilement to the roasted cumin and coriander. I made the suggested polenta. It was a great compliment. To those who might have found the polenta lacking in flavor, find a cheese shop and buy top grade parmesan reggiano (the aged true Italian).. this will like cost 12 bucks plus per pound... worth every penny.

This recipe was a cinch to make and was absolutely delicious!!! We didn't use the lime with the pork chops nor added the polanta and it still turned out great. I think it was really wonderful! Emailed this recipe to my friends too.

Followed recipe and I think the squeeze of lime and chopped fresh cilantro is essential to these chops. Made with the polenta recommended, but next time I think I will try with an old Cumin Rice recipe I have... KIMBER

Quick and easy. I agree to removing the chops after frying and reducing the drippings with butter and sherry. I served the chops on top of the polenta with the reduction sauce. This was served with a side of green beans. Tasty and my family liked it. Recipe doubles well.

Made this one with a pork tenderloin - added some cayenne and white pepper for some heat - and degalzed the pan w/ some dry sherry and a pat of butter to finish off the "sauce". very good!

Didn't really care for this. It was super easy to make which I was excited about but I was disappointed in the taste - there was something missing from it - I added mandarine oranges on the side which added some sweetness but maybe some honey in this would work well?

This recipe is wonderful. I have time to cook since I am retired. Quite often I prepare extra portions of new recipes for my next door neighbor to try with me. She and her husband agree, the flavor is incomparable. And so easy to fix.

I had corrinder seed sitting in my closet that I didn't know what to do with. You gave me the inspiration to try something different. I toasted and ground the seeds and mixed it with the rest of the ingredidents and they made the the most delicious pork chop I have ever tasted.
