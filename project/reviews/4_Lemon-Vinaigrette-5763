This is my favorite dressing. Amazing on a kale salad. Even better when meyer lemons are used.

Always looking for a good basic vinaigrette recipe - this one hit the mark! Will definitely be my new standby. I did cut back olive oil to 1/3 cup per other reviewers suggestions but otherwise followed exactly.

I cut down the olive oil as recommended and added the juice and zest of a whole lemon. The only recommendation is the addition of extra dijon mustard. My dressing has a bit too much dijon aftertaste. That being said, this vinaigrette is delicious when tossed with baby spinach, fresh strawberries, and some walnuts!

This is delicious. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of honey in addition to the sugar. It really made this over the top good. I have been craving salad ever since.

Very yummy! Mixed it with some angel hair pasta, tuna and diced red peppers for a quick light dinner. Will be making it again for tomorrow's salad lunch!

This was quite bitter when I made it. Perhaps it was the lemon.... I added a bit more sugar and tasted it again, still bitter, so I added honey and it turned into the most perfect lemony vinaigrette ever.

Used this on the Grilled Bread and Tomato salad -- excellent combo and loved the vinaigrette.

I followed other people's advice and cut back on the olive oil to 1/3 cup and added extra lemon juice and lemon peel. Delicous on roasted baby artichokes!

This dressing is delicious! I added a little extra mustard. Highly recommended.

Wow! I make all our salad dressings at home, and this is one of the best! Like other folks, I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup, and used the juice of one whole lemon. I also added 2t of a Mediterranean spice blend. My suggestions: use very good olive oil, use a small chopper to really emulsify the dressing, and don't listen to the reviewer from 2/12, they clearly aren't rating this salad dressing!

Wonderful over salad, beans, rice, etc.

I made this with a little less olive oil and more lemon juice than the recipe called for since that is how a restaurant near us prepares their lemon vinaigrette. It was perfect tossed with arugala and topped with warm goat cheese and pine nuts. We will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious! Served this over baby arugula, toasted hazelnuts & crumbled feta. Totally strange to get this excited about a salad dressing, but it really is terrific; this will be my new go to vinaigrette recipe.

Yum. yummy. Great over a green salad with goat cheese, mango, and avacado. Don't shallots make everything taste better? I used slightly less olive oil. I also used Meyer lemons from our tree.

I used this dressing when trying to recreate a greek-style orzo pasta salad I had recently in a restaurant. It went great along with some sun- dried tomatoes, greek olives, artichokes, mint and feta in the salad! I added a bit more lemon juice than called for. Fresh and delicious!

Delicious! A perfect compliment to the crab cake and mesclun appetizer...but versatile enough to be served with many other things.

We loved this Vinaigrette recipe, the only change I made, was I added a wee bit more sugar. Served it over fresh green salad.

Made this with baby greens topped with mini crab cakes. Delicious. The dressing complimented the crab.

I recently had a lemon vinaigrette in a restaurant and just had to find a recipe to make it at home. This was delicious--a very light dressing. I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I served it over field greens and shaved parmesan cheese on top. I will be making this dressing frequently!!

Simply LOVED this Vinaigrette! I have made this many times and shared this recipe with many of my co workers. This also makes a great maranaide for Chicken or fish.

I had never made my own dressing before, so I chose this recipe because it seemed simple. It turned out wonderfully even for a novice like me. I used it on a baby arugula salad with caramelized walnuts and some fresh parmesan. Yum!

I've made this vinaigrette numerous times now (first paired with the crab cakes from epicurious) and it turns out wonderfully every time. It is pleasantly light and crisp and is great on a hot day, especially in contrast to an otherwise heavy meal.

This was nice and light, and it stands up well to both soft and firm greens. I love it on a mixture of Romaine and Arugula. Also, I added a pinch of gray salt to counteract the sugar--it was delicious!

I like this because it's very light and subtle. I drizzled it on a salad of sweet baby greens with yellow tomato and avocado. I made it twice and didn't have shallots one of the times and it was just as good.

Very tasty and useful for several recipes. I used it with the crab cakes found on Epicurious and it was perfect!

Made exactly as printed - DELICIOUS! Toss on arugula and shave some good aged parmesian (with vegetable peeler)on top. It looks like restaurant quality and is a perfect mix of flavors.

Took Ventura's advice and served this over blanched asparagus spears (no nuts). Loved it!

Rating: 4
I took the Cook from Ventura CA's advice and made this to go with asparagus and served it as room temperature as a salad --it was BRILLIANT. The toasted nuts were an inspiration. Used walnuts, because I didn't have any pecans; next time I'll use pignolis. This is a fabulous buffet dish.It may make it to my Thanksgiving table. Thank you, Ventura!!!!! p.s. how would this flavorful vinaigrette be with broccoli?????

I was very disappointed in this vinaigrette. Even after I tried to 'fix it' up it still was nothing special. There are far too many good vinaigrettes out there to make this again.

I served this dressing with steamed asparagus and sprinkled toasted pecans over the top and it was delicious I could have eaten the whole thing! I forgot to zest the lemon so mine was without but this is a fantastic dressing. I did end up using a little more sugar than called for. Delish!

Very, very tasty. I used the peel of one whole lemon, rather than 1/2 tsp,used onion instead of shallots, and tried the dressing with a whole- seed, mild Dijon. It is delicious. I'm planning to keep it on hand as a staple because we eat a lot of salads.

Very nice. This is my 11-year-old son's specialty. I figure a couple of recipes like this under his belt & he'll never be a hungry bachelor.
