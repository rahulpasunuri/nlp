I made this for a group of friends using really thin spears. Roasted about 15 minutes to make it roasted rather than steamed and it was perfect. I made it ahead and served a room temp.After washing allow to dry or it will steam in the oven.

I was just looking for ways to use up a packet of feta that some kind soul thought I needed, when I came across this recipe. "Hmm," I thought, "I like asparagus. I like popping things in the oven and leaving them there. I should try this!" So I did. And it was amaaaazing. But I wouldn't make it again, because the feta is finally gone, and I don't really like having it in the house. I just get tired of Greek omelettes and salads, you know?

It's delicious. Have made several times. Tonight I added hazelnuts and almonds before roasting...YUMMY!

I already made this twice - once with green and once with white asparagus (I liked green better). It was absolutely delicious, and even my parents liked it - and they are very picky eaters. Both times I served it with garlic bread and home-made basil pesto. For the 30 minutes it took to make from beginning to finish, it's a very tasty, very fast dinner, and will become a regular at my table.

From a Gourmet to those who want it to be complicated...it does not need or have to be. Sometimes, the very best "gourmet" meals are simple, well put together, and a compliment to whatever else is being served. The idea that it is peasant food if it is not time consuming and complicated is ridiculous. This paring of asparagus and feta is a perfect example of putting two delicious foods together to create a sensory explosion; which is what any good "cook" wants to do anyway.

This is excellent! With asparagus season just beginning, this is so good with just picked spears. I read reviews and someone said to use infused oil, so I made my own with garlic & thyme as I was using those with the meat I served with. I strained the oil before I tossed with the asparagus. Yummy!

Now that asparagus season is almost over, I've found that this is a good recipe for other veggies. I made this using fresh carrots, broccoli, califlower and beans. I made enough for 4 servings and my husband and I finished off the entire pan. I'll use this often.

A great speedy boost for this is to substitute a vinaigrette for the plain olive oil. It can help tailor the flavor to your meal, or give it some extra depth.

I've prepared asparagus this way for years. Feta and gorgonzola are both good choices, but try it also without cheese. Try using a good quality rosemary-flavored olive oil! Another option is to place the marinated asparagus on the grill and toss until blackened. It's like eating French fries! If you do this, double the quantity, as the asparagus skrink quite a bit. In my opinion, they taste better if they are a little "too salty" and are lavishly sprinkled with pepper before cooking.

Scrumptious! Better than the sum of its parts. I used French feta from a Lebanese market. I made two large bunches of asparagus for 8 people, and everyone wanted more. Made this alongside a grilled whole beef tenderoin, sauteed portobellos and red bell pepper w/ a balsamic glaze, mashed potatoes, and some crusty bread. Delicious meal!

Delicious and very easy. As recommended by an earlier review, I sprinkled the feta on the asparagus and put the dish back in the oven for a few minutes. My only change for next time would be to add less salt, since feta is usually quite salty. The asparagus had beautiful color and flavor and the amount of feta called for was perfect--not overwhelming.

OK, so, it's August in Atlanta, and I haven't roasted asparagus for a few months - who wants to heat up the kitchen in 90 degree weather, but we've had a cold front come through - like October weather - tried this recipe - simple, great side - added feta on top at the beginning, based on another reviewers suggestion - great & simple!

Rating: 4
The simplicity of this recipe is what makes it so strong. (Pair it with a complex entree that takes up far more of your attention and time, and you'll be quite grateful that time was "wasted" in printing this no-brainer.) I used Saledana's goat cheese crumbles when I made it and thought it probably gave superior results to regular feta -- the cheese softened enough to be creamy without melting, and complemented the delicious roast flavor beautifully. Everyone loved it, and it paired nicely with top sirloin steaks with a port wine-rosemary reduction. Making it again as we speak. Yum!

I tried this one evening when I had some asparagus in the frig, very little time, and wanted to do something other than steam it. A delicious and SIMPLE dish. Roasting brought out the flavor. I have sometimes added the feta at the beginning and it was wonderful!

I agree with the New York cook. why would gourmet waste space on such a no-brainer recipe? It's not that this recipe isn't quick and tasty, but I (used) to read Gourmet because its recipes were challenging and really tested my skills. It just seems that Gourmet's recipes these days belong more on the inside of, say, a puff pastry package than on their pages.

This is the best spinach dip I ever tasted. I use a 10 oz. box frozen spinach, thawed and drained completely. The garlic is powerful, but garlic is so "in". If the onion is too strong, try using half shallots. This never lasts when I serve it. I know the guests really want to lick the bowl.

I'd not tried roasting asparagus before, and loved the results; so easy and good. As a vegetarian, I wanted to make this the centerpiece of a light meal, so I served it atop baguette slices that had been liberally smeared with chevre (which is what I had on hand when surprised with asparagus freshly picked by a guest). It was great, and feta would be even better.

Here's the deal with this recipe. If you love asparagus, you will love this method of cooking. My feta cheese fell off too but i didn't care.

Absolutely the best ingredients: I picked the asparagus minutes ago, tossed with wonderful extra virgin Greek olive oil (Don't bother to comment on this one, I don't like Italian olive oil, personal taste), salt and pepper. Added wonderful French feta, just purchased at the neighborhood deli/grocery. Add a slice of organic whole grain bread from the local bakery........ I don't like the combination! I took the cheese off and put it on the bread. The roasted asparagus is just too good to mask the flavor with the cheese. Maybe those who liked it need to taste freshly picked asparagus! It's truly a different veggie than the stuff you buy in the store.

The best Asparagus I've ever had! I sprinkled on some parmesan and added the crumbled feta (Athenos low-fat) half way thru so the cheese got a little crispy. It was fabulous. There were only 5 stalks leftover, which i've been dreaming about all day!

My husband made this last weekend and neither of us was very impressed. It was OK, but just not very flavourful. We had some lovely French feta cheese so perhaps the asparagus wasn't very tasty. Or possibly my husband under-seasoned it. Anyway, I shall give it another try myself as its a neat way to cook asparagus and couldn't be easier.

I took this to a May day party. Thoroughly enjoyed by everyone including a friend who won't usually eat asparagus. I didn't have feta so used another goat cheese which was too soft to sprinkle so I added bits and then tossed the whole mess. It melted and was divine.

My husband and I are both not big asparagus fans, but I had been determined to find a recipe that really makes it delicious--and I have! I like to roast the asparagus until it's blackened a little (5 minutes longer than recipe recommends) and the feta adds the perfect tang.

One of those instant treasures! It's a family staple already, and I just got the issue of Gourmet three weeks ago :) The flavor of roasted asparagus is so new and surprising, I feel an obligation to serve this to guests - especially guests who have children, b/c it is so incredibly easy, too. What a winner! Measure the salt as specified - it's important that it be right. You're freer on the pepper. My husband prefers a bit less feta, so the asparagus flavor is more prominent, but that is something you can easily alter to taste b/c it's added after cooking.

I went to Whole Foods and got a chunk of sheep Feta cheese from France. What a difference. It doesn't take like the cheaper Feta that I use on Greek salads. I crumbled it and let it "melt" on the roasted asparagus. Oh, fresh ground sea salt is wonderful on it too.

Asparagus is wonderful baked, charred on the Bar B Q.....Let us not put down powdered onions & garlic. They also have their place in the kitchen. They are wonderful for "DRY Rubs" for ribs, chicken. Powdered onion, garlic, little paprika, dry mustard, & little salt & pepper.... Delicious

OH! NO! Don't throw out those rusty old tins!!!Especially the one that says 29 cents for paprika! Collector items! As much as warm memories return of over cooked vegies & a table full of special people, I'm sure glad we've found new & better ways to prepare them. Roasting & grilling just about any of them--with the exception of peas for obvious reasons--has to be the most nutritious when using olive oil.

Get into the new century and roast or grill all your vegetables! Just toss with a little good olive oil, then garnish (or not) with garlic, lemon, chives, dried herbs, parmesan, feta or any cheese, etc . Flavors are enhanced and none of the taste or nutrient goes down the drain. Try eggplant, zucchini, carrots, parsnips, peppers, onions, mushrooms, and combine colors or seasonal. Slice as big as possible for the grill or invest in a BBQ wok. You'll never steam or microwave again.

It was hilarious reading about the onion powder and crusty old tins. I went home recently and threw out all my Mom's old spices, including some that were priced at 29 cents (when was Paprika 29 cents?) I also get a kick out of the people who make the recipes but change all the ingredients. (though I often use their variations!)

We have actually made this dish many times over the years as its a healthy accent to most meals (part of the medditeranean diet) and you can change it easily by adding a little roasted walnut peices or almond slices. About the cook in Washington doing it over charcoal? YUK! use real wood - oak is good in the NW - down here in Tucson we use mesquite but the key is to blanch it slightly forst then gril quickly for the taste not more color. Don not overcook!! Yum! My kids will even nosh on this stuff! (yes lemon is a good addition as well)

Hey, I like those "crusty old tins" - I buy my herbs and spices in the bulk department (a tiny fraction of the cost of packaged) and save the old tins to store the fresh stuff. Saves setting up a whole new storage system and my old "lazy susan" works just fine!!! By the way, try the asparagus grilled (over charcoal) - it's fabulous!

Have been roasting asparagus for several years. Try adding toasted sesame seeds before tossing with oil - great!! Have not tried adding lemon but will next time. Everyone always requests this side dish. Do mine @450 for 8 minutes - 10 at the most. Also prefer Parmesan to Feta.

Onion powder? Yikes! This dish is terrific and I agree, with a little lemon just before it is done, it is great. I have made this in the past and instead of Feta, used Parmesan. It is terrific that way as well. Do not put the cheese on until 1 minute before it is done roasting. YUM!

I strongly second Tribeca's amusing comments about the onion powder and icky old-spice cabinet stuff. My mom still uses that awful smelling stuff! :) It doesn't even taste remotely like onions. If you like onions, add some chopped "real" onions. Better yet, shallots would work well and roast magnificently. I think this recipe was very good as written. The French feta is a bit moister than others I've tried.

Blech! Onion powder. Reminds of all those old crusty tins that housewives in the 50's, 60's and 70's kept on their "lazy Susans" for years on end. You know, back in the day when "entertaining" meant whipping up some awful "casserole?" Remember? Onion powder; garlic powder; celery salt; parsley "flakes"; dried/minced onion; decade-old paprika . . . How did any of us live through that?

I've tried a couple of recipes with cheese and don't really like them. The cheese doesn't stick to the asparagus thus having to fish around for the cheese to have a bite with the asparagus. A simple way that I like is brushing with olive oil, sprinkling with garlic and onion powders, some fresh ground black pepper and a little lemon zest. Then roast according to the recipes directions. Fantastic!

This is a great, easy dish that also happens to taste great! After reading the reviews, I intended to add a little balsamic, but completely forgot. Turns out it was great without it as well.
