Delicious but did make a few changes. Added finely chopped garlic and some chipotle powder to the marinade and reduced the amount of mustard by half. Marinated for longer. Everyone in the family loved it.

The marinade didn't have a lot of flavor. I ended up making a second batch of the marinade which I reduced in a saucepan on the stove and poured over before serving.

Delicious marinade, but I would use less rum, it overshadows the mustard and maple syrup.

The salmon turned out great -- flaky and moist. I followed the previous suggestions -- 2 tsp.mustard, boiling the remaining marinade to a glaze to serve on top, and roasting at 400 for 20 min. I served it with the Spicy Lemon Quinoa recipe from marthastewart.com and sautéed asparagus -- a lovely and delicious meal.

This went over big. I sprinkled the salmon with garlic and seafood seasonings(dill etc. Didn't have parchment paper so lightly oiled the pan. Kept left-over marinade - heated to boiling and used to baste and as a sauce at table. Used White Cuban rum which has a smooth flavor and used only 2 large teaspoons rather than tablespoons for mustard. Definitely a keeper.

I simplified this dish. Just used favorite BBQ sauce and maple syrup mixed and poured over salmon. Also found salmon was perfect doen at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. My family wants it at least once a week.

I hardly ever follow a recipe exactly as written, I love to try a twist. I grilled the salmon on a cedar board and used the maple glaze to baste with.

This was a very good recipe for a simple and different meal using salmon. I think you could use this on other firm fish such as halibut and sea bass. One thing I did which I cannot believe is eliminated from this recipe is: take the marinade, put it in a small sauce pan and reduce it to a syrup. I put 1-2 tablespoons on top of the salmon and then broiled it for 1-2 minutes. You need to watch it constantly so it doesn't burn. Then put it on a plate and top with the remaining glazy sauce. I feel that it does need some zip though to cut down the sweetness. Next time I'm going to sprinkle some creole or southwest seasoning on before roasting.

I liked this even more after adapting it a bit--- I added fresh crushed garlic to the marinade---and I put a drizzle of maple syrup & olive oil on top of fish & finished & crisped it up in the broiler.

Because of the less enthusiastic reviews I almost didn't try this but I was in a hurry and I had all the ingredients so I did. My husband and I really enjoyed this. The flavor is very subtle but it did enhance the taste of the fish. All I added that wasn't mentioned was fresh ground pepper. I served it with candied sweet potato and asparagus.It was so easy. It is the type of thing you make when you want to feature the side dishes.

The only reason I would make this again is becaue my kids liked it a lot. My husband liked it enough, which surprized me because he is not really a sweet kind of guy. I just felt like it was a little off - missing something it seemed. Maybe I'll like it more next time. It may be a taste you have to get used to if you don't eat salmon like this often, we typically eat it with dill or lemon.

We love salmon - but this marinade left no dark glaze and no marindade flavor. Very tasteless, just a slight hint of rum flavor. Would not make this one again.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare salmon as it's a favorite with my family. This was very easy and tasty. The finished product didn't have as much marinade flavor as I thought it would have, but it was still good.
