This was just delicious!! Served it with beets with cumin and mint also from this site. The aroma as it cooked was fantastic. The garnishes really add a lot also.

This recipe turned out edible after doctoring a lot. Used half of the cardamon, as it has a very strong flavor. Added caramelized onions, garam masala, cashews, golden raisins, coriander, lemon juice, and cream until it tasted ok. It made it acceptable. The chutney and yogurt do add a different note. Doubted I will make it again. If you don't cook or eat a lot of indian food, this might be a good start, but if you do, this is kind of one note.

I will not rate the recipe because I used veal instead of lamb,otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.I liked it a lot and I am going to make it again and again. The tomato and cilantro complimented the dish as was the addition of some lime juice.Yogurt is going to be good too, especially the Greek brand.

I made this last night for my husband and myself and we LOVED it! I mixed some spicy pork sausage in with the lamb, used a large jalapeno, and also a serrano chile pepper. I also mixed some fresh green onion into the tomato/clilantro mixure for the top. Very spicy and flavorful. The yogurt on the top was a nice touch - it tones down the heat of the dish. I will definitely make this again and again!

Really yummy. Added chopped onion, 2+ summer squash,so doubled cardamom and curry. Chix. broth instead of beef. A sprinkle of cinnamon really made a difference. I can see toasted almonds/raisins on it if you like...

Very Good. Used ground beef but followed the rest of the recipe as written. I look forward to using lamb the next time. My husband liked it and has requested we make it again.

Really very good- used lamb but beef would work too. Used chic. broth , also added a bit of garam masala with spices. Addictingly good and so easy!

This is one of my favorite weekday dinners. I give it 4 stars not only for taste but because it's so easy to prepare and I always have the ingredients on hand. I use ground turkey instead of lamb, chicken broth instead of beef, and often add 1/2 to 3/4 of a can of chickpeas. My husband and I have been eating this for years and never grow tired of it.

This is my fiance's favorite weeknight dinner. It's simple, spicy & satisfying. I make it as is (at least once a month), perfect.

One of my favorite recipes that I make at least once a month. Don't change a thing. Prepare exactly as listed.

A good weekday dish - fairly quick and easy. I usually add spinach or other greens and up the jalapeno as I like my food spicy.

This was definitely spicy, but I like the heat. Minted Cucumber Raita cut the heat nicely. Also served it with Mango Red Pepper Chutney--delicious! I couldn't find ground lamb, so I minced some chops--worked perfectly. Served Chicken Tikka as an appetizer; Curried Cauliflower as a side dish & Mango Sorbet for dessert. Mmmmm, mmmm, mmmmmmm!

I just finished this dish and I'll write this review as I wait for my husband to get home - and enjoy this great meal. I made the recipe almost as written (substituted chicken broth for beef) and ran into a few problems. The dish stuck to the pan bottom and I had to add water to make it liquidy enough to stir. I'd estimate that I used about 1/2 cup water. I was stirring quite frequently and tasting as I went along. Orzo was quite firm inside, then all of a sudden, it was done, almost mushy. Watch sticking and orzo doneness carefully. Taste is really good. I think the spice is just right. The color is less-than-appealing, but I'm sure the cilantro and tomatoes on top will help with that.

Bland and disappointing. To add flavor, I served it with spicy condiments on the side. Not worth repeating, even with revisions.

Served this, without the lamb, next to lamb chops (see recipe this site, lamb with rosemary and artichokes), and skipped the tomato based on what other reviewers have said. Used some tinned chilpotle peppers I had in the fridge and some somewhat fatty home-made beef stock. The dish turned out very nicely indeed.

I usually only make again recipes that rate a "3" here. This one's an exception--interesting mix of flavors, husband loved it, but somehow I can't go 3 forks on it. We will, however, have it again, but I will probably take the advice of the reviewer who suggested adding golden raisins and cashews to the finished dish.

Rating: 2
This was extremely easy. I used turnip greens instead of mustard greens only because they were what I had. I believe any greens would work fine. I will add more jalapeno and/or curry next time. It was not spicy enough for me but I like it spicy. I would probably make it again simply because it was so easy. It was good but not great. My husband did like it too.

Rating: 2
Good, not great. I used lean lamb but so much fat cooked out of it that I drained it, then returned 2 tbsp of oil/-fat to the skillet. The flavor would be improved by the addition of 1/4 c golden raisins and adding toasted pistachios or cashews to the topping.

Thought it was a delicious recipe. The ground lamb was fabulous. I added finely chopped red peppers and peas to the recipe.

Pretty good, but not out-of-this world as I was led to expect from prior reviews. I will make it again because it's relatively easy and somewhat different. But, when all's said and done, this is basically Indian Hot Dish. Regarding the preparation: even though I enjoy moderately hot food, I played it safe with the jalapeño and didn't use all the seed, and not quite the whole pepper--and it wasn't too hot. Would use more next time. Also, didn't need 1/2 cup cilantro, found the tomato as a garnish superfluous, but the yogurt was great (as was the mango chutney).

I found this recipe here several years ago and have made it atleat 20 times since then. Everyone I have ever made it for has loved it and always ask for it again. I usually make it with ground beef and it works out great. The lamb is very tasty though. I usually add more of the spices than it calls for but don't overdue the cardamom. This is my favorite all time dish!

Rating: 3
Yum! A big hit -- tasty and easy to boot. The only thing I would do differently is drain the fat after cooking the lamb. It doesn't take much fat to saute the vegetables, so unless you use extremely lean lamb, you'll have a very fatty dish unless you drain some of it.

This was quick easy and yummy even though I cheated quite a bit - couldnt find lamb - got grd turkey - might try beef next time, but turkey was good and light. I also didn't have any good tomatoes accessible, so I used a can of diced tomatoes and just mixed them in - worked fine and added some moisture. It got rave reviews although I'm sure the presentation is better with fresh tomatoes! Like one other reviewer, I would add some salt while cooking.

My market had no lamb on the day I planned to make this dish so I substituted grd beef and used just a spot of good olive oil for flavor. It was great! Next time I will salt the meat during browning (you end up using far less overall this way) as we all ended up adding salt at the table. The spicy mango chutney and a yogurt raita are great flavor, temperature and texture compliments. Keep the Indian recipes coming.

This dish rocks! YUMMMMMMMMMMY. Use a good curry and don't subsitite the meat. My husband begged for more, BEGGED.

This recipe had all the individual elements that I like but the finished texture / consistency was not appetizing. Although I used a major well known brand of orzo (Barilla), cooking the orzo in with the rest of the ingredients as the recipe required made the end result pasty and thick. If I were to make it again, I would cook the orzo separately and mix into the finished dish.

This has become a favorite for us. The flavors are so rich and different. I would always use lamb, not a substitute. I serve it with pampadams, a yougurt raita, and a chutney. We can't stop eating it.

To make this a vegetarian meal, I substituted 1 cup of lentils which I had simmered for 25 minutes for the lamb and used vegetable stock in place of beef stock. I also served it with cauliflower and brocoli and warm pita/naan bread.

This was really tasty, but a bit spicy for us (ok, compared to everyone else who reviewed this, we're lightweights!) Next time I will tone down the curry powder. I used Farmer Johns ground pork which is very low in fat and it worked very well. Also, I prepared everything up to the part where you add the broth so the last minute cooking was very easy. Overall, we enjoyed it very much and highly reccomend. Thanks all for your reviews and encouraging me to try this!!

I just love Indian dishes. It is my husband's and kid's favorite too! Ground lamb is the perfect meat for this recipe never use any other meat.Lamb has so much favor to offer. A little more broth is needed to mix all the flavors and ingredients together. It is hard to find ground lamb in the market so I have to make my own. It is less fat and fresher. I will definitely make this recipe again.

As the cook from Boston pointed out, substituting lamb with turkey is rather all right. I used 97% lean minced turkey and didn't even use a single drop of oil. There was enough residual fat from the turkey to cook everything. Tried the orzo with a couple of different toppings. Salsa was actually rather good. The vinegary and cold balanced out the dish rather well.

I am experimenting with Indian dishes and this one caught my attention, and a good thing too! Kids (who are relatively adventurous eaters) enjoyed this, although i was forced to use 1/2 a two-inch jalapeno WITHOUT the seeds in order to tone down the heat, and it was the perfect temperature. Also needed more broth than was called for...but otherwise, a very flavorful and easy dish to prepare.

Outstanding dish. Nice enough to serve company, yet a one-pan meal so quick to cleanup. Easy enough to make for a weeknight family meal. Flavors are complex and a wonderful mix...just the right amount of heat too. Served it with flatbread and yogurt dip, and cucumbers and tomatos to garnish. Husband loved it and keeps asking when I'm going to make it again!

This is a wonderful main course, simple but deep with flavor.

We loved this, and I would make it again, but the orzo was a little sticky. It probably needed more broth. I couldn't find ground lamb on the day I needed it, so I ground my own - it was fresher and leaner anyway. Very good!

Fantastic dish!!...Lot's of indian flavors!!.. One note...nexttime I make it No olive oil...there's enough fat from the ground lamb to provide ample richness for the dish.

This recipe is a staple in our house. I serve it with Patak's Hot Mango Chuntney, Patak's Brinjal Pickle (egg plant) and Patak's Garlic Relish. This is for those who like it spicy. Major Gray's Chutney is too sweet. Also serve Pappadums with it. I buy Patak's items at the health food store.

My mother found this recipe for me on epicurious. I make it all the time on demand. Everyone loves it and we never have leftovers. You can subtitute the meat for beef or turkey. It tastes great with spicy Mango Chutney and plain yogurt. It's nice on the taste buds. Thanks. It's easy to make too!
