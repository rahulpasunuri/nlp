i felt this recipe was a great starter dish. like many others i felt it was basik to start with so i just added some more veggies. the nice thing about this is you can change ingredient with something else so it stays interesting.

This is fine as is, but I think it needs more to justify the high rating on the site. Maybe some red pepper would make the difference, or maybe something to brighten it.

This is wonderful and easy, easy, easy! It tastes so good that no one thinks about how healthy it is. My only advise is to get everything ready before you heat up your skillet--you've got to move fast once you start stir-frying.

I did not enjoy this recipe at all. It was barely edible. Way too salty, too gingery. At the same time, there was no dimension to the flavor. It might've helped if I'd added more vegetables like other reviewers did. I made it according to the recipe above, and it was basically a disaster.

I loved this! I am always trying to find ways to use edamame and this recipe does it well. As other users have said I would suggest cutting down on the soy sauce. I also suggest adding some of your favorite stir fry veggies for some more color. I added shredded carrots and cabbage. The walnuts are a really nice touch and so are the green onions!

This was so easy and tasty. The first time I followed the instructions 100%. We found that we could get away with less tamari (we watch the salt) so we used 1 TB for the walnuts and 1 TB for the chicken pieces. It was very good too. Don't skimp on the ginger!

Excellent and simple. The first time, I made this as written. The second time, I was out of brown rice and used white. Don't...it is much better with the brown. I also added red pepper on others' suggestion, which was great.

Wonderful flavor! I had asparagus, a small yellow squash & 1/2 a red pepper on hand so I used those instead of the edamame (which I didn't have). Didn't have any green onions, so subbed 1/2 a lg. vidalia, sliced (sauteed that along with the other veggies). Mixed the walnuts in before serving. We didn't find this at all salty - actually added a pinch of salt. Served over rice instead of mixing it in. We all loved it, including my 11 year old. Quick, easy and healthy - definitely something I'll be making this again.

Didn't even add the rice and it was still really good. The walnuts are a nice touch.

Rating: 2
This is a tasty dish and quick and easy to prepare, especially if you have leftover rice. The only thing I didn't have was the chopped scallions and I think that might be a key ingredient for a little crunch and counterpoint to the saltiness. I'll make this again and add them, plus red pepper as others have suggested.

Very yummy. Used cashews instead of walnuts because my local grocery store is terrible and was out... but it was a delicious substitution! Even better than the walnuts, I think. Also added red bell pepper for color.

Rating: 3
Not bad. I added carrots and red bell pepper, made the color jump out. I would suggest cutting the soy sauce on the walnuts in half and adding a teaspoon of brown sugar. As instructed, they were way to salty.

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this recipe, however; it is important to be cognizant of timing. After I started the brown rice in my rice cooker, I prepared the chicken in the marinade. I waited until the rice was almost fully cooked before starting the edamame, which allowed enough time for the chicken to marinate in the honey and soy sauce. Everything turned out great and it proved to be a delicious week- night meal.

Excellent. The walnuts drizzled with tamari and then cooled were delicious. Gave me the idea to just make those walnuts sometime as a snack. I used beef in this recipe b/c that is what I had and it worked well.

Rating: 3
Easy & delicious. I added broccoli, sugar snap peas, and red bell peppers for color, and some red pepper flakes for a touch of spice. I didn't cook the walnuts in the soy sauce as directed and it was fine. A winner!

Fast, easy, healthy, and delicious. A great way to use edamame beans (found frozen in the health food section already shelled); however, you could substitute any combination of asian style vegetables. I love the flavor of stir-fry ginger, garlic, and chicken. Excellent. Will make again and again.

Oh my! Everyone loved this recipe. I added some chili paste for zing, red bell pepper and some bean sprouts for substance, and to apease my vegetarian daughter, used chicken-style seitan. This will certainly be repeated!

This was great! I didn't expect it to be so flavorful with only 4TBS of soy, but who knew? I cooked the rice and walnuts the day before to save time for my weekday meal. Added a bit of cilantro to the final product.

Added 1/2 onion (large dice) and sauteed with chicken. Then added two cups of broccoli at the end which had been steamed for 5 minutes. Took previous reviewers advice, and toasted walnuts without soy sauce and added the 2T to mixture during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Also added 2 teaspoonsful of Thai red curry paste to give it a little kick. A tasty, healthy dish.

Next time I will skip the soy sauce on the walnuts and add it to the marinade. I added broccoli since I needed to use some up and it was a nice compliment.

I really liked this! I agree with another reviewer that said the color was just too brown, so I added in red pepper and fresh broccoli. I will definitely make again.

One of my family's favorite weeknight meals. I follow the recipe loosely, adding more garlic, ginger and edamame while cutting back on the rice to give the dish more ooomph. Keep the walnuts separate when storing leftovers so they don't get soggy.

This is a great, flavorful dish that I'll make again. I added carrots and substituted peas for the edamame and thought both worked well. The walnuts are a really nice touch. Looking forward to the leftovers!

Holy Canole that's good! I loved it, husband loved it, and it was healthy too. I meant to add chili flakes but forgot, but did remember to cook the chicken in toasted sesame oil. This rocks! Enjoy.

This has become a staple at my house. I toast the walnuts in a cast iron skillet without the soy or tamari. I add the soy/tamari to the rice mixture instead.

I love this recipe because it's delish but so dang hip, too. I used wild rice for some flash. Hot pepper flakes were added by some of the more hardcore in our group. I might add red peppers next time, for color.

I made this as-is (except for the addition of some broccoli) and thought it was good, but a tiny bit bland - I'm going to try again with some modifications. Maybe add some honey and soy sauce (like the chicken marinade) when you add the rice, and perhaps also use more ginger. Overall, though, a good recipe and I love how healthy it is!

This recipe comes together very quickly with layers of flavors and textures surprising for the relatively short time it takes to make. I added red peppers, which added a little more crunch and color. And, as other reviewers have noted, the leftovers reheat very nicely.

what a spectacular one-disher! made it the first time as-written, and it was lovely. made it a second this evening and... cut the amount of tamari tossed with the walnuts in half and added about 1 tbsp of honey; added another 1/2 cup of edamame (save yourself the time and buy them pre-shelled). divine!!!

Found it a little bland as written. Perhaps extra marinating or additional flavors would help.

Really good and simple to make. I did the tahini thing, too, and added a few drops of hot chili oil (cause I have it and I think it'll take the rest of my life to use it up!). Forgot to sprinkle the walnuts over, but it was yummy anyway. Can't wait for lunch to have it with the walnuts.

Very easy and exceptionally tasting. I used chicken thighs instead of breast meat, and I used tahini paste 50-50 with soy for the marinade. It was awesome! A big hit with my husband!

This is my first review! my husband and i absolutely loved this recipe - made it exactly as is, but added half a red pepper cut into strips, and cooked the brown rice in veggie broth for some added flavor. the nuts were delicious in this recipe

I thought this dish was good but, as written it was lacking in flavor. After tasting it, I ended up adding about 2 teaspoons oyster sauce and hoisin sauce and 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce. Those additions really perked it up. And made it a nice, quick, healthy meal I would make again.

I love this dinner, and it is even better the next day for lunch!!! My kids even love it. I don't use the edamame and I double the walnuts. This dish is easy and has made its way into my 10 dish rotation. LOVE IT

We love this dish! The key is not overcooking. When stir fried properly, the chicken is juicy & tender, the edamame slightly firm, and the tamari marinated walnuts and green onions give it great flavor. You can easily substitute regular soy sauce for tamari. This is one of those "can't stop eating it" dishes in our house! It's a bonus that it's healthy.

My dinner guests and I thoroughly enjoyed this meal! The most complicated part of the recipe was figuring out that "edamame" was frozen soybeans. (The reviewer that found it monochromatic probably used dried soybeans which would make this dish very beige - the frozen are nice and green and make a nice visual presentation). I look forward to making this again!

Very healthy and very filling recipe. To add color and more nutrients, we add one chopped red bell pepper, some grated carrots (buying them pre-grated saves time) and frozen corn kernels. The brown rice is nicer than white rice for those watching their cholesterol.

The flavor was decent, but lacked interest - also, rather dry.... I whipped up a miso-sesame-vinegar dressing as a topping after trying the dish.

Very good! Loved the walnuts & will try that technique with other nuts. Others are right: it is very brown, but it disappears so fast . . . who cares!

the chicken tasted really odd but the fact that brown rice was palatable was fantastic. now i omit the chicken, edamame, and walnuts and just make the rice(with sesame oil, soy sauce, and a splash of teryaki) as a side.

Awesome recipe. Simple yet tasty and healthy. Everyone LOVES this one.

Rating: 3
Very good but very brown. I swear, the chicken was the exact same color as the rice--it looked a little like medieval gruel. I also didn't get the walnut-cooking instructions: they don't really cook with no oil but get really hot, so by the time you pour the soy sauce on, it singes to the pan. It was very delicious and healthy but next time I'll try baking, instead of pan-frying, the walnuts, and add broccoli for my veggies.

Rating: 3
I loved this recipe. Very good and quick to make if you cook the rice ahead of time. Luckily I was able to find pre-shelled edamame which made this dish even quicker. I did end up mixing the rice together with the other ingredients only because if seemed as if there might not be enough sauce to serve over the rice. I ended up also adding more soy at the end just to moisten it all a little more. This will be made often in our house!

I made this last night, taking the recommendations from the other reviews and came up with a delicious dinner! I added water chestnuts and served over the brown rice (not mixing it in with stir fry) and it turned out well. The walnuts are a nice topper. My husband is very suspicious of new vegetables - but he really enjoyed this.

This recipe is easy and delicious! But, instead of stir-frying the rice, I just stir-fry the rest and serve it over the brown rice...a little easier and healthier that way

This recipe is very healthy and nice and light. I made it for a group of health conscious women and they all enjoyed it. The ginger gives it a wonderful flavor. I used white rice instead of brown and it turned out fine. Also, I used light sesame oil and I think it give it a lighter flavor then dark sesame oil. The walnuts really made the dish and gave it some great texture. I think for a stir-fry dish it had a unique flavor and I would definitely make it again. You might want to think about adding water chestnuts.

I thought this dish was great- next time I would definitely make the rice ahead of time, and shell the edamame ahead of time- those were the most time comsuming parts of the recipe. After that it was quick and easy. I might also add a tiny bit more rice and less beans.
