Admittedly I have not tried this recipe but I give it 3 fork rating as it is missing slaked lime. I know that may sound wierd to some people but after much research that is how it is made. It is called dulce de calabaza or calabaza en tacha. I made it this past fall. I used the food grade slaked lime that is also known for making pickles. I will try it this way though and rate again.

Scoop out the fiber and seeds. What else would you do with them, unless you want an extra-extra dose of fiber.

I find these directions to be very confusing. What do you do with the seeds and fibrous flesh when it's finished cooking?

Thank you sooo much epicurious for bringing back pleasant memories of the way my grandma used to make her pumpkins, I was just telling my husband about the way she used to cook her pumpkins with piloncillo and we would eat it with milk poured over the top, but I couldn't remember exactly how she did it! WOW! Now that I have found this recipee, I can make it for my children and grandchildren.
