I really loved this salad. It was light and refreshing. I substituted sour cream because I did not have any greek yogurt. The beets and carrots were fresh from the farmer's market. I will make this again!

It gets 1 fork because yes, it is a beautiful salad. That is the only nice thing I can say about this one. The orange tasted weird with the sweetness of the beets, the yogurt dressing was not good--we added some rice vinegar and that did help. Just walk away. The fennel salad from the same issue may not be as gorgeous, but it TASTES a lot better. Try that instead.

I made this for a 4th of July party. I love Chioggia beets, but I've never had them raw. On its own, I thought it was pretty bland and nothing special. I though it tasted better alongside spicy BBQ ribs. The yogurt and orange flavor were fresh and cooling. I would probably not make this again though, it got very mixed reviews among my guests. Some hated it, while others thought it was good (but not great!)

I really believe that the delicious beet has been ruined by canned salad bar beets and many people who think they do not like beets, simply have not had fresh, well-prepared delicious beets. I thought this would be a great recipe to sneak people into eating beets (raw beets even!) since they don't have the intimidating glisten, color, or meatiness associated with those salad bad abominations. This recipe however, is disappointing. I might try to matchstick some beets up again, but not with this yogurt dressing. Blah. Next time maybe on mescaline greens with feta, and a fancy olive oil.

This is the first I've ever enjoyed eating beets. Crisp and bright, fresh taste. We used a vegetable grater instead of julienne cut. Paired well with the rich Sausage, Roasted Red Pepper, and Spinach Torta Rustica found on this site.
