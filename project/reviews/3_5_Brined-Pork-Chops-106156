The flavor is fantastic and the pork chops are tender an moist! The super-thick pork chops make for a great presentation. Make sure you brown the pork chops wellthat seems to make the flavor richer. This has become my New Year's day traditional meal. In keeping with the southern tradition, I serve with southern style greensa mixture of collard and mustard cooked traditional soul-food style, black-eyed peas, and either rice or mashed potatoes. Always a HUGE hit at dinner! ...and raved about by my guests long after New Years.

I wondered why the recipe did not call for salt/pepper on the chops before searing. I trusted that the brine would flavor them well, but it did not. I bought pre-packaged pickling spices AND added my own. My first suspicion was when the brine tasted bad. No Flavor. Won't make again.

I think these are the most tender pork chops I've every eaten. I also used 1 inch chops and marinated only 24 hours but still they were perfect. I found them very flavorful and not at all too salty. They are slightly reminiscent of salami but we love salami so that's no tragedy. I am completely sold on brining now.

I LOVED the pork chops -- they were so moist and tasty...and fairly easy, too, considering the brine is a no-brainer to make...will make again.

Well-flavored, moist and easy to make. Served at a dinner party to everyone's enjoyment. A recipe to keep and repeat!

These were excellent. I usually think pork chops are boring and dry. These were so flavorful and juicy, I can't wait to make them again. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 1 inch chops.

I prepared the recipe as written including making sure I brined the chops for 48 hours. Since it's summer I decided to ditch the rest of the recipe and grill the chops which turned out to be very tasty. I accompanied the chops with Eggplant Parmesan from the recent issue of Gourmet. Very interesting and delicious combo.

Bland and uninteresting, not what I expected. Easy to prepare.

Loved the taste. Would try to make it every time if possible and time permitted.

Great pork recipe. I didn't use the brine listed here, I found this recipe when I had the chops already brining in plain salt water. I used the rub and got rave reviews from my (picky) boyfriend, who usually isn't a big pork fan.

This was excellent! My dinner guests thoroughly enjoyed it...thanks.

I'm struck by the disparity in the various reviews. I come down somewhere in the middle. I found the recipe easy to make, and the chops were tasty...but certainly nothing to die for. Moist yes, but pork is pork (with the exception of baby back ribs) and to this day I've never had a piece that is truly moist as you would find other meats. All in all, certainly not a bad dish, one that I'll make again sometime.

The chops remained very moist and were extremely tender. In this part of the country ask for "Iowa Cut Chops".

I am a big fan of brining. I can't imagine cooking my T-day turkey with out brining!! I usually stick to the "Cook's Illustrated" method but thought I would give this a try. I followed it to the letter and overall enjoyed the results. Moist and juicy and not at all too salty. However for those of you who found it too salty but liked the moist results should try brining with differnt combinations of flavors. Apple cider adds a great flavor that lends it self to pork quite nicely.Just skip the sugar and pickling spices. Keep the garlic if you like and add some cloves if you like cloves. You can cut down on the amount if you prefer but not too much!

Excellent! Kosher salt, of course. Hello? Not salty at all. And the chops really do need to be 1 1/2" thick. I'm going to bed tonight with "pork belly", I just couldn't stop eating it, even after I was full. Made the menu from Gourmet: mashed potatoes and turnips with horseradish, and roasted carrots and beets.

This was great. The marinade really tenderized the pork chops. I know some folks don't mind tough meat or dry meat, but this was the most tender, moist pork chop I have ever eaten.

We liked this recipe. I marinated for 36 hours. The pickling spice is not overwhelming, but some people might not like the flavor. I did not think it was to salty. I used sea salt.

I thought this recipe was easy to make and turned out delicious. I made a serving for two and cut the ingredients accordingly. I also brined for 24 hours versus two days and it tasted perfect, not too salty.

Easy to prepare, but the results were way too salty. I brined them for two days (using kosher salt) and would not make this recipe again. I also don't usually salt my food onced served. My wife always does, liked this recipe and found no reason to salt them. Surprise, surprise.

These were not too salty at all-- in fact, they were some of the most delectable chops we've eaten in a while. Perhaps the cooks who found this to be too high in salt used table salt. Kosher salt is a must for brining anything.

I totally agree with the cook from Saratoga. This recipe produced chops that were MUCH too salty, and not nearly worth the effort it took to brine them. No noticeable difference, in fact, in the texture. I can't believe the brine is supposed to stay on the chops when you take them out; they would only be tasty with a huge amount of really bland carbohydrate to absorb the salt.

I've already made this recipe twice in two weeks. Not only a great dinner for six, but great for a hot meal for two during the week...two chops one night then two chops brined the next night. The only thing I think doesn't quite work is the reduction. We used a Pinot Blanc the second time instead of Riesling and it seemed to bring out the flavor of the chops more. But a wonderful quick recipe....about an hour start to finish.

I think this method of cooking pork chops should be thrown out with the brine. Although it was easy to prepare, I felt the result tasted like low end deli meat; much too salty and artifically flavor enhanced, like a butter ball turkey! I much prefer a dry rub or marinade to this salty brine!

Absolutely delicious! I served these for a dinner party and all the guests raved over them. I'm so glad I asked the butcher for rib-cut chops as they were much better than the traditional center-cut chops. Easy to prepare, great flavor---this recipe is a real keeper.

I really liked this preparation. It had a nice bright flavor and was easy to prepare. I brined the chops for 2 days as recommended. I even enjoyed this as a leftover reheated in foil in the oven.
