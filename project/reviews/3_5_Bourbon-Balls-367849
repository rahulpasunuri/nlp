We love this recipe!! We make these gluten free, using arrowroot cookies, instead of wafers. 16 ounces of cookies is equal to four cups ground. And, I measure about four ounces of pecans for one cup ground. If you can't roll them right away, add a touch more bourbon, other wise they'll dry out. www.itssewyou8.etsy.com

I'm giving this recipe 4 forks for the incredible ease of making it as well as the yummy taste. I love bourbon, so these were right up my alley. Didn't add the sugar to the cookie mix, just used it to roll. I think they would be way too sweet with 1 cup of sugar in them. Left them out dry for most of the day then rolled in sugar. Rolled them in sugar again a few days later before putting them in my cookie baskets. Yum, yum, yummy.

These were a HUGE hit at a company Christmas get-together. Everyone under the sun asked me for my recipe! I added 4 T of cocoa to the mix. Did it all in the food processor. If it is a little dry when you're ready to roll...add a little more bourbon. Couldn't hurt.

Recipe doesn't say to reserve the confectioner's sugar. Also the mixture is too dry to shape into balls. Comparing similar recipes indicates the amout of vanilla wafers is too large.

family has made these for years, with the addition of cocoa (takes the edge off the bourbon, i think), and friends ask for them every holiday. great eating, great gifts, easy to make

Have been making these for 40 years and lost my recipe. Agree with the addition of the cocoa. Easier to make if you put all of the dry ingredients into a food processor and let it do the mixing. Also easier if you mix the white syrup and bourbon thoroughly before adding to the dry mixture. Better if you roll into balls and let sit out for 24 hours before rolling in powdered sugar. These keep in airtight tins for several months. In fact, they need to ripen for at least six weeks.

AWESOME AND EASY. Thanks.

These are super easy, great as part of a holiday treat basket. My only warning is that they taste like bourbon, so if you aren't a fan, these aren't for you. Keeping them in the fridge or freezer for a week or more helped tone down the alcohol flavor, and made these great for snacking on as a sweet treat.

Steph, Karo is a popular brand of corn syrup. They also produce maple-flavored syrups, so the recipe is just specifying plain old corn syrup as 'white Karo.'

My family has been making a version of these for 2 generations, only we add 4 tbs of cocoa, which makes them more complex. You mix the crushed cookies, nuts and cocoa, then add the syrup, mix, form into (about 1 tbs) balls, and roll in powdered sugar. Fantastic. Last year I had to modify the recipe, using ingredients found in italy, and for someone with a nut allergy. It turns out these are just as good--perhaps even better--with any kind of mashed packaged biscuit-type cookie (italian breakfast cookies), with peanuts instead of walnuts, and honey instead of karo. This year, I'm back to using nillas to see if they're as good, but definitely keeping honey in as a substitute for the karo. BOOZY YUM.

I LOVE THESE COOKIES!! My mom used to make them when I was a kid & she would keep them in a tin coffee can. You would get a serious wiff of bourbon when you would take the lid off the can to sneak a few of these ... This is why I still love 7 & 7's I am sure!

The white Karo referred to in the recipe is white corn syrup. Here in the U.S. Karo is the brand. If you can find it in Canada, it's usually in the flour/sugar/baking aisle of most supermarkets. White Karo syrup has a red label. Hope this helps.

I liked this recipe but it was unclear whether the 1 cup of confectioners sugar is mixed in, or is just used for rolling. I mixed it in and rolled the balls in additional sugar, and the recipe is a little sweet. I will try them the other way next time.

I meant to say, "white karo." Sorry for the confusion.

These cookies sound delicious, but can somebody tell me what what karo is and where I can get it?
