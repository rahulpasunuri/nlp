I did a 20 lb bird, stuffed with a stuffing from this site, for about 5.5 hours at 350. Can't imagine doing a bird at 425. I still glazed at the timelines suggested in the recipe, and it looked really good, although the skin was very dried out compared to birds that have been buttered under the skin. The skin separated from the turkey making it pretty much impossible to cut any pieces with the skin on it. The glaze was good and as I say, it looked very good, but I'd do a different recipe next time.

Used the glaze last year and it was wonderful. The turkey browned beautifully. I will be using the recipe again this year.

If you are looking for something special, move on! This recipe produced a lack luster turkey without any special flavor and not very moist. The gravy was inedible. sorry.

Made it for Christmas dinner. The cider glaze made all the difference in keeping the turkey moist and tender. In contrary to the recipe, I glazed it after the first hour, then the second hour, and then every half hour after that. It browned beautifully, and then put tin foil on it from browning too much. The family was impressed and will make again next time.

Used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year & it turned out perfectly! It was also the most picture perfect Turkey I've ever seen in person. I'm looking forward to repeating this for Christmas dinner.

I very much liked this glaze, as did the rest of the family. Next time though, I will add it multiple times throughout the roasting process to make it even more noticeable.

This is the first turkey that I really liked. Mine was done before I even glazed at the bird at 1hr 40min. I brushed some glaze over anyway and let it sit for a while. Came out very juicy and moist. I followed the recipe except for the timing and I added fennel tops to both the cavity and the gravy.

My husband was in charge of the turkey and gravy for the first time this year and he chose this recipe. He followed it to the letter and the turkey and gravy were delicious. The turkey had a lovely, crackly skin and the gravy had a slightly sweet tang from the cidery drippings. There were many steps involved, but as a first-timer he was able to get through it all without much trouble.

This was a disappointing recipe. I liked the glaze and would use that again but roasting at 425 degrees dried the turkey out and it was done MUCH earlier than the schedule in the recipe and it was tough. I have cooked many turkeys over the years and have never had one turn out dry and over cooked until now. I recommend using a standard cooking chart for the time and temperature. I did like the gravy recipe, it was a big hit.

This was the worst turkey I have ever had. It was burnt in some places and completely underdone in the center. It had to be cut up and reroasted! The skin had no flavor, the gravy had too much of a wine flavor. My advice? NEVER RUSH YOUR TURKEY!!!! 425 for less than 2 hours? I thought I should try it though. And the leftovers were tough and tastless.

I also put rosemary and sage under the skin. The gravy was divine and my guests were extremely happy.

We like trying out different turkey recipes before deciding on which one to serve for Thanksgiving. This one won out over our usual Porcini Mushroom Rubbed Turkey with Shiitake Mushroom and Madiera Gravy (here on Epicurious). It was FANTASTIC!! I recommend pairing this with Brown Sugar Baked Sweet Potatoes and Acorn Squash (also on Epicurious). It is a delicious pairing!

This was the first turkey I have ever made and it was perfect! The only thing I would say is that I had a turkey with a pop out to tell when it's done and I think the glaze sealed it down. Even though the thermomiter read that it was finished, the popper never came out. I took it out anyway and it was done. So, don't trust your popper I guess.

Excellent recipe. I'd make a few change though - add some herbs under the skin - sage, rosemary, and some lemon peel. For the gravy one C of wine was enough. I also added some of the stock to the dressing. Yum.
