This is a great recipe. You can substitute any nut and spice you want (I usually make them with hazelnuts and cinnamon and cardamon). Be sure to take the time to really brown the butter - they turn out heavenly everry time.

I've made this several times--to use up egg whites saved from pot de cremes, etc. which has led me to look for more financier & madeleine recipes.
