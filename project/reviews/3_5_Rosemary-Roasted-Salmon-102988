20 minutes is WAY too long. You'll get a dried out piece of salmon. If you want yours rare, this is not the recipe to use. Nice flavor from the rosemary and lemon is the key. Nothing special, IMHO

Excellent no fuss dinner. I was a little hesitant pairing Rosemary and Salmon but it works very well. My salmon fillet was just under one pound so I reduced the cook time to 17 minutes. Perfect!!

This is definately a keeper. I made this for my family of three. We have lots of leftovers that will not go to waste. I will definately prepare this for a dinner party. I found the herbs to be perfect, nothing bitter about it. I left the rosemary on the branches, perhaps that is the difference. I agree with the previous reviewers about the cooking time. For 2 pounds of center cut salmon fillet, this took 45 minutes to cook. Luckily I was warned by the reviews. Unfortunately the longer cooking time causes the onions to really carmalize and some of the onions stuck to the roater. Even with an overnight soak it was a tough clean up job for my husband.

It was good, along with the tip about using a dijon, red wine vinegar, garlic paste it was very moist. But I didn't notice the rosemary, maybe mine was not so fresh.

Wonderful dish and beautiful presentation - especially when you arrange the rosemary springs and lemon slices on top per serving. Don't skimp on the red onions - they're delicious! The rosemary was quite subtle and brought out the wonderful flavor of the salmon (I used wild caught fresh Atlantic salmon.) If you have leftovers, remove the skin from underneath and keep the lemon slices on top. Great chilled too, served with a mayo/lemon juice condiment. Very easy to make. Definitely a "do over."

4 stars for being extremely fast, incredibly easy, yet elegant and tasty. I left out the onions because husband doesnt like them, served it with wilted spinach and baby potatoes. Dinner was ready in less than 30 min and was absolutely delicious.

I've made this a number of times in the past, but always felt it was lacking something. It is easy and fills the kitchen with a nice aroma. Thanks to some ideas from previous reviews, I minced some garlic with dejon mustard and some red wine vineger to make a paste and coated the salmon with it. It really improved this recipe. I'll be making it more often now.

I used rosemary from the garden. It was so delicious and easy.

Best salmon I have made! Use wild salmon and very fresh rosemary. Instead of drizzling the oil, I brushed it on each layer of ingredients, using less than 1/3 Cup. Since some earlier reviewers claimed the oven temp was too high, I preheated oven to 500, then lowered it to 375 when I put the fish in - it took 7 extra minutes. Oven temp really depends on how thick fish is, and whether it just came out of the fridge or not.

Rating: 2
I thought it was good, but I didn't think the rosemary really added much to it. In my opinion, it would have tasted just fine without the rosemary. I believe that without the rosemary holding up so high, though you may want to reduce the amount of oil so the fish isn't just sitting in it. In fact, I would reduce the amount of oil by about half and just brush the fish with it.

I used individual salmon filets with no skin, roasted for 10 minutes. Quite tasty and easy to prepare. Served with Long-grain & wild rice blend with carrots and asparagus with orange dressing, both found on this website.

I don't know how much a "bunch" of rosemary is, but I felt like this salmon, although delicious, could have used some more flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except for not knowing how much herb was called for - I used one box as purchased from the produce section at my grocery. It was definitely delicious, served with Butternut squash risotto for harvest fall meal but will use more herbs next time.

rosemary and salmon are a great combination (even better, in my opinion, than with capers)! however, with this recipe i have (several times) added fuji apple slices, a few splashes of red-wine vinegar, a sprig of thyme, and 1 large clove of freshly minced garlic, applied on the bottom of the baking dish and covering the top of the salmon...it adds just a tinge of sweetness in the salmon and soaks into the onion creating a great complimentary topping! and the apple slices, interestingly enough, still retain a purely baked apple flavour, also a great side to serve with the entree!

Great as is, but next time I would cut the salmon into individual portions before roasting. Even on convection bake with 5 extra minutes cooking time, it was not done enough for our tastes. (Note, though, we like roasted salmon done through. If you like it quivery in the middle, this would probably be fine.) No problem with bitterness from the rosemary as noted in some other comments.

I tripled this recipie and as said before turned out fool proof. Couscous intimidates me a little, and it was a real meat and potatoes crowd, so I maid garlic mashed potatoes with red potatoes, had a nice olive bread and ceaser salad.

Followed the recipe as written and took the suggestion in the recipe of serving it with Couscous, fennel, orange salad with olives, beets orange vinegarette. I served it with turnip greens instead of spinach. Our guests loved the dinner. I prepared the fish as suggested and left it in the fridge for 8 hours before putting it in the oven. The rosemary added a very delicate taste of the herb throughout the fish. This was a very different taste from the more conventional manner of preparing salmon.

Second year I have made this recipe for my non-red meat eating friends at Christmas, and it went over great again! It does seem fool-proof, and you can control how seasoned you'd like the fish to be by adjusting the length of time you allow it to marinate in the fridge once it's assembled. And by really thoroughly covering the fish with lemons and onions, 500-degrees does not seem to be too high a temp. Love it!

I prepared this fabulous dish for our dinner club of 14 people. It could not have been easier and I liked the fact that it could be made ahead. There were rave reviews that night that continued the next day. One woman who previously did not like salmon was converted! I served it with a risotto herb torte and french green beans. Try it!

Rating: 0
I would like to try this dish but have one question I would like answered before I try it, if someone could be so kind. The recipe says to leave the skin on the salmon when baking it, however many of the reviews I read said that the salmon tasted bitter if it was in contact with the rosemary. I can only assume that those who said the salmon was bitter, did not use salmon with the skin on? Could that have been the problem possibly?

I was a bit sceptical about using so much rosemary, I thought it might overpower the dish. Boy was wrong. My husband and I thought that this was the best salmon we had ever had.

This is one of those fabulous fish preparations that works so well because of its simplicity and the harmony among the strong-flavored ingredients. I have prepared this dish several times, and find two factors are key: really good fresh rosemary and at least 3-4 hours in the fridge before cooking. I made this for my in-laws along with spanakopita and a Greek salad. Wonderful!

This was delicious, I only had 1 bunch of rosemary on hand and will do it again using 2 as suggested. I thought I would have enough salmon left over to do salmon cakes the next day but it was all gobbled up in one sitting.

After reading all of the reviews, I'd expected this to be phenomenal. It tasted fine, and was certainly easy to make, but I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary. Per an earlier suggestion, I doubled the onions which was a smart move, because I needed them to add more flavor diversity.

Rating: 4
I have made a few changes which I think enhanced the flavor AND made it easier in the kitchen. I recommend doubling the amount of red onion - everyone is crazy for it. Instead of roasting it in oven at 500 degrees, try this: Create a pouch of double heavy duty aluminium foil - make as suggested except double onion. and put it on a 500 degree gas grill sealed up - it comes out fantastic - and juicy as can be--easy to clean up and no fishy smell in house. I do this all winter long (gas grill). My husband really doesn't like salmon and loves this dish.

This is a "4-star" recipe (a rating which I RARELY give). It is amazing how something so simple to prepare could taste so good! I figured out the "bitterness" problem. My first serving had a bitter taste. The second serving did not--the reason was because I had placed the rosemary sprigs diagonally across the fish. My first slice was under the rosemary sprig and my second was not and IT was delicious. Next time I will place the rosemary sprigs lengthwise across the fish so that the flavor of any one slice will not be too intense/bitter (I served the fish with creme fraiche which was delicious). It would be fun to experiment with different citruses ie; oranges or grapefruit (and different herbs). I will probably top the onions with some sliced mushrooms and drizzle white wine over the top for added dimension next time, although it is plenty good as it is!

Rating: 2
Was "ok" - followed earlier suggestions, but it was not as flavorful as the addition of all that rosemary would indicate. Maybe I should have added some capers or cilantro, as another reviewer suggested. But then that would be a difft. recipe...

I made this for a birthday dinner, with wild rice pilaf and fresh asparagus, followed by the rhubarb anise upside down cake (see this site for recipe-yum). It was incredible!

This was classic and austere, but maybe just a little dull. And I think 500 degrees for 20 minutes was too long - the fish was a little bit overcooked. It looks lovely, and its certainly fine, but just not all that interesting. There are better salmon recipes elsewhere on epicurious.

Sorry guys, but this did nothing for me. We had nice thick center-cut fillets, but they were definately overdone at 500 degrees. Apparently there is a trick to cooking fish at just the right temp and to just the right doneness, and I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS!!!!!!!!!!

I made this recipe for a 4th of July Party. It was a hit! I prepared the salmon with all the fixings on foil, and then put it on the Barbeque. It turned out well. I'm not a fish eater, but I'd say it was pretty good.

I have made this several times. I cook it at 475, and to keep everything from going up in smoke I make sure that the rosemary and onions are all tucked in under the salmon, and that lemon slices completely cover the top. The flavors (and aromas) are outstanding. I also made a salad using the roasted salmon and onions on top of mixed greens with roasted asparagus and a balsamic vinaigrette. Awesome.

Made this for Father's Day. Super-easy and great presentation for the table! This was the first time I ever purchased and cooked fresh fish. I was nervous that I'd under/over cook the fillet. As it turned out, I under cooked it. Fortunately, I was able to put it back in the oven for a bit. Would have liked more tips on how to tell when it's done. I will make it again! Next time, I'll consult my new Seafood cookbook!

I really liked this one. I made it for Father's day dinner with fresh rosemary that my Dad grew. It was really easy, tastes great, and is easy to prepare.

I made this tonight for the second time. Absolutely WONDERFUL! To those who say the rosemary gets dried out and bitter: You may not be using enough lemon slices. I cut enough lemon to completely cover all the salmon and rosemary, and it never dries out. It's fragrant, delicious, yummy! I forgot to buy a red onion this time, so I used white instead. Still just magnificent. The high heat caramelizes the onion to an amazing sweetness. Do not fear the 500 degrees! Use lots and lots of lemon slices as a shield for the salmon and rosemary - this dish is simple perfection.

I don't know what all the fuss was about. I made this recipe based on the rave reviews it got but was really disappointed. I thought that it was blad and non assertive.

Very good flavor combination of the herbs, lemon, and onion. Also used the reduced baking temp. of 375 degrees and came out quite nicely. I think it took about 40 min to cook fully, but we watched it carefully and checked it for doneness often. Paired it with the lemon scented saffron rice from this site, and it made a nice accompaniment.

I prepared this for a potluck for which I was the host. All considered it outstanding.

Blech! What did I do wrong? I love every one of the ingredients, but somehow the rosemary ended up with a horrible bitter taste, infecting everything it touched.

I've prepared and eaten fresh salmon for almost 50 years and this is the best! Sensational taste while easy and fast to make. I make it for company and am always asked for the recipe. I've cooked it with fresh red and white King Salmon. I did note though that I had to cook the center cut fillet (almost 2 inches) 40 minutes instead of 20 minutes.

I halved the recipe and made this using regular onions and dried rosemary, and it still was a tasty entree; it could only be improved by using the red onions and fresh rosemary that the recipe calls for. Depending on the thickness of the salmon, I think that you can cut the cooking time down to 18 minutes to assure that the fish is moist and tender. To accompany the salmon, I served couscous and canned callaloo (carribean spinach is the best way to describe it--any good market should have it) with toasted pine nuts, and they were easy, inexpensive, and complementary side dishes. Overall, this is one of the tastiest quick meals that I've come across--honestly, it takes 30 minutes from start to finish. It also is quite visually impressive. I highly recommend it.
