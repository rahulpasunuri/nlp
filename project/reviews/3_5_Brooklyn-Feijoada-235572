I love this recipe. I have made it about 10 times over the years. Sometimes I use all the meats, sometimes I only use some, but it's always good.

This was a pretty good feijoada! I left out the beef and the chicken broth since they are not really part of the original recipe. I couldn't find "carne seca" and I don't like ribs, so I used pork loin, pork chops, sausage and bacon. I added a bit of tabasco since I didn't have malagueta peper. Yummy!
