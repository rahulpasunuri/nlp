A modification for a household tired of fennel included eight leeks, cut to the first break in the leaves, in place of the fennel, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to heat it up. The results were utterly fantastic. We loved it so much we're planning to serve this as a dinner party entree this week.

An excellent recipe for cod which doesn't have a lot of flavor on its own. Easy and tasty. Needs the color of the fronds or parsley on top for eye appeal and added flavor.

This is pretty good but honestly, it's not very attractive on the plate, which I do think is a factor. The cod is prepared the way that I usually make it on my own so it's fine. The fennel is quite good like this- soft and tasty. But I agree with another reviewer that a lot of the sharpness of the fennel, which many people like, is cooked away and drowned by the cream, broth and tomatoes. While I really enjoyed it, I'm not sure I would make it again because of how it looks and how the fennel got a little bland.

The bacon, cream and mustard in this dish overwhelmed the taste of the fennel. If you like the taste of fennel, there is a better recipe on this site, curried scallops with fennel compote, that could be adapted to use mild white fish like cod.

Great recipe for cod; used fillets from Costco that I had frozen - held together perfectly. Unfortunately all my usual shops were out of fennel, so I substituted leeks. Delicious! Especially since my significant other is a huge leek fan. I did find it took the ragout awhile to cook down, but well worth the wait. Will definitely make again when I find fennel.

Yummy! My son, who claimed not to like fennel or cod, has changed his mind. Wonderful, rich, complex flavors. Will definitely make it again soon. It's a keeper.

This came out perfect! Only thing I did differently was to omit the bacon and we did not miss it. I'm not sure why others had issues with cod falling apart when pan searing. Maybe it was previously frozen? Not sure, but we did not have issue and really liked it pan seared - had very nice carmalized crust.

This is a great recipe just as is. One way to cook the cod so it doesn't fall apart is to quickly sear it in a hot pan and then finish in a very slow oven (250) for 10-15 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.

This dish had great flavor although I opted to add twice as much sundried tomatoes and garlic than the recipe called for and used grilled scrod instead of cod. Next time I will use a bit more fennel, I like a strong anise flavor.

My husband grew up in a cod port in England and he can't stop raving about this recipe. This from a man who did not like cod. I have a few changes to suggest-I broil the fish first and then add it. I make the recipe the day before and let the flavors merge. I use fresh grape tomatoes, halved and thrown in at the end for slight cooking, and I skip the bacon. The Dijon mustard, for me, is the killer secret ingredient.

Absolutely delicious - I used a firm piece of halibut (after reading the reviews of how the cod didn't holdup)and made the receipe exactly as written with the exception of the cream - I used a single cream instead of a double/heavy cream. It was incrediable. A keeper !!!

This was very good and very easy to put together.

This was GREAT. I made it with scrod. I wouldn't have put so much bacon in, though--made it too salty. I also only used about 1/3rd of the cream, and the rest was pureed silken tofu. In general, I thought it called for too much salt. Very tasty recipe!! The anise was incredible.

This dish was WONDERFUL! Very sophisticated and flavorful, but not particularly complicated. I've been looking for new ways to serve fish, and I plan on adding this to my regular repetoire.

This recipe was very good. Very flavorful and easy. I doubled the garlic (usuallyl do) and increased the amount of sundried tomatoes. The fennel didn't seem to add a lot to my taste. Maybe I'll try a different vegetable and not cook it as long next time. But, it was loved by all.

Excellent. I loved this.

My husband really liked this and he is not a huge fish eater. I thought the flavors blended very well together. I can't wait to make it for my son-in-law who is a fish fancier and loves to cook himself.

Really good and quick in term of prep time for midweek dinner. I roasted the fish fillets at 400 with a bit of broth and S&P, so they held their shape and that also cut down on fat. The whole thing still tasted rich with the bacony, creamy sauce.

I found this dish to be very easy to make. The dish has a flare of sophistication that will make your guest(s) think you're a genius in the kitchen....shhh. (Oh-- one more thing, Fresh Alaskan Cod holds its shape to perfection.)

I thought for sure that a recipe which called for heavy cream, bacon and garlic would be a recipe for success. Indeed everything seemed to be going well, the anise was aromatic, the cream sauce was lightly browned from the pan-fried ingredients, the Cod held its shape and was appealing atop the Creamy Ragout, yet, I was disappointed. Though you may have to find out for yourself, I'd recommend not cooking the anise so long, and triple the pepper and garlic and half the Dijon.

I don't think this recipe was anything to rave about. I was disappointed that the cod didn't hold it's texture and fell apart while cooking. I'm not sure if I did something wrong. I wouldn't make this again. My husband didn't care for it that much either.

WOW- so delicious! To make it a one-dish meal, I added diced yukon gold potatoes in with the fennel and it was superb! A really rich, fabulous dish.

This recipe was fantastic! The missing fork is simply because the cod didn't hold its shape as picture perfectly as I would have liked, but it was a delicious meal - served over angel hair pasta with steamed asparagus on the side.

I don't usually try an "unreviewed" recipe but I had picked up a loin of cod that was super fresh and wasn't sure what to do with it once I got it home. I had a fennel bulb in the fridge so I gave this a whirl. It was a perfect weeknight meal on a cold rainy night. The fennel ragout was divine and really brought out the sweetness of the cod loins. Served this with some angel hair to take full advantage of the sauce. yum.
