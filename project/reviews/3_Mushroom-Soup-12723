I didn't really like this... I would recommend less soy sauce, as the other reviewer did, but even then I don't think it's worth making again.

This was a great soup. I added a small amount of wild rice & topped off soup with a small toasted french bread slice. Will definitely make again.

Reduce the amount of Soy sauce and don't chop mushrooms too fine, replace the wine vinegar with Balsamic vinegar and add a 1/4 tsp of white pepper. We use field mushrooms picked at 6.00am. The soup is suitable for gourmet meals!

it was warm and soothing especially in the winter. It warms your very bones and tastes better with every bite. I would make it again if it was a little more mushroomy.
