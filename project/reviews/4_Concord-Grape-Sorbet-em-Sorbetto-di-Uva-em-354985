Has anyone tried a food mill instead of the blender? Might be a good option.

The grapes were a bit time consuming to strain, but worth the effort. The flavor was heavenly. I used Splenda in place of the sugar for a sugar-free, dairy-free, gluten-free and practically calorie free dessert.

The only reason I gave it 3 forks and not 4 is because I agree with another reviewer- the sugar in the recipe is way too much. I used 1/2c instead of 3/4c and it was still too much. I would use 1/4c to start and add to taste next time. But otherwise- amazing color, amazing flavor - I think the concord flavor is bursting out! I was shocked that the seeds stayed intact and separated so easily, this is by far the easiest concord recipe I've encountered, and soooooo delicious! I put in some skins for texture and it looked and tasted gorgeous (after I had strained the seeds out, I spooned them out of the sieve and was left with some skins in there that I added to the juice). Definitely needs a pairing or cookie as others have suggested, its hard to eat too much of it on its own since the flavor is so intense.

Loved this recipe! We picked a big paper bag full of Concord grapes from my in-laws backyard, and I had no idea what to do with them all....wound up making 5 quarts of this sorbet! The prep work took a bit of time for all those grapes (washing, de-stemming)...but the rest was a piece of cake! Like the other reviewer, I was afraid of blending the grapes whole, but the seeds remained intact, and were strained out along with the skins when pressed through a colander. The flavor of the sorbet was amazing - very intense and grape- y! :)

This is the least labor intensive way to use what grows wild in the backyard. Served with a small scoop of vanilla gelatto and a sprinkle of honey roasted peanuts as a sundae. Sort of a fun take on PB and Fluff. Enjoy!

Mine was stunning in color and intense in grape flavor. Simple, beautiful, fat-free. Outstanding!

i had 2 quarts of concord grapes sitting on my counter and looked at many recipes. last year i made a concord grape pie that was a ridiculous amount of work and wasn't really that good. i thought this recipe was wonderful. unlike other reviews, i felt that it had a strong concord grape flavor. the color is beautiful! i found other recipes that were much more labor intensive and i am glad i tried this one first because obviously you don't need to go to a lot of work for a great end product.

Don't expect the knockout flavor you get by eating a fresh concord, but its still mostly there - it smells wonderful, great color. it needs a peanut butter cookie...or - I agree with lucindah - a sorbet pairing.

I liked this but it wasn't as intense as i expected/hoped. I cut way back on the sugar and was happy i did. I think it would be better in a sorbet trio than alone.

So delicious... although i substituted agave for the white sugar (only needed about 1/4 cup). Love the taste of slightly tart grapes.

Delicious.. In Italy this grape is called "uva americana"

I love Concord grapes and this preparation distills the flavor to an amazing intensity & color. I was a little apprehensive about blending the grapes without seeding them---which would have been way too time-consuming. However, the seeds remained intact and all came out in the straining. Also, I didn't use an ice cream maker; instead I partially froze the grape puree and blended it in a food processor--twice. It was smooth and delicious.
