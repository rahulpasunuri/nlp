This chowder has become an annual New Years tradition for me since I first saw it on the cover of Bon Appetite in 2003. It is a bit labor intensive but worth it, and don't skimp on getting anything but the best ingredients, such as fresh Dungeness crab (I'm on the Pacific coast) and the chanterelle mushrooms. The flavors just melt in your mouth and it is a satisfying meal in itself. Great with fresh warm sourdough bread and Sauvignon Blanc

This is the second time I've made this - a big hit - hearty and yummy. I added cayenne (per another's suggestion) to give a bit of zip.

The sauteed chanterelles in this recipe are terrific, I am fortunate to have just harvested some from my "spot". I will roast or grill the corn next time, as I found the corn had a crispy texture that didn't like. Another reader mentioned a pinch of cayenne and that was highly appreciated. Bacon really does make everything better!

Delicious even without the crab as long as you have rad mushrooms. I added chopped dried porcini (and the soaking water). Served with homemade sourdough and the recently posted Lamb Shank Ragu from this site with great success.

I could not get enough of this chowder! Although a bit high maintenance, it was worth every yummy bite. I did substitute crimini mushrooms for chanterelles, pancetta for bacon, and 1/2 and 1/2 for cream and all changes were delicious. I think next time I will add more liquid for the broth, as this was a little too chunky for me.

Made this last night for Valentines Dinner. Wife loved it. I added a pinch of cayenne for zing, frozen roasted corn instead of fresh for sweetness and richness, substituted fresh oyster mushrooms for chanterelles for a meatier texture and used fresh tarragon instead of fennel for a softer mintier anise flavor. Seared scallops floated on top finished it off instead of crab. Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser!

I give this chowder 4 forks. Great smokey taste with bacon. I used 1 cup whole milk and 2 cubs 2% milk. I used frozen corn and cremini mushrooms. I didn't have fresh crab, so I used one can crab meat and 1 pound fresh scallops. I sauted the scallops before adding to the soup bowls.

We love this and even served it as part of Thanksgiving one year. We made some changes: used frozen corn, no leeks, more bacond than it called for, added green onions, added 1/2 lb scallops and 1/2 lb shrimp. Everyone loved it!

I have been wanting to make this recipe for 2 yrs! Spent the better part of the day preping....followed the directions to the "T"...only thing was...wrong time of year for chantrelles. So I used dried...BIG MISTAKE. Very disappointed in this recipe..if I make again would leave out the mushrooms, not needed. Also, I think I might use fresh fennel in stead of the seeds so flavor is not so overpowering. Bottom line..I SO wanted to love this dish..not impressed.

Rating: 3
WOW! this is good! and it makes a ton! I think that next time I make it I will leave out 1 ear of corn, just to make it a little less thick. This is a great chowder to make as summer turns to fall and there is still good fresh corn and chanterelles are in season.

Not easy to make, and really expensive, but worth the effort for a special occasion. Go for lump crabmeat, not "special" or flake - it really makes a difference.

I agree on it being too rich. On the second try, did 1 c cream & 2 c lowfat milk...yummy. Substitued cognac for the sherry. Some hot sauce added just right zing. Fresh corn is an absolute must (canned corn gets such a yucky texture).

I made this last night and was very pleased. I had my boyfriend rank it compared to the lobster chestnut soup recipe (also on this site), and while we loved both soups, we both preferred this one. Try it!

I love chowders & really thought this one would be a winner. But it turned out a bit on the bland side. I think it needs stronger flavors, perhaps some hot sauce.

A dish everyone should try once. It was too labor intensive for me to want to make again and tweak my mistakes. However, next time I would use canned sweet corn (the corn on the cob I bought wasn't quite in season yet) because I think the recipe needed the corn to be sweet. I omitted the celery (wasn't on hand) and the fennel seeds (ick - fennel!) and substituted some red wine I had around for the sherry; also I used dried thyme. I really liked the chanterelles - I know people have used other mushroom varieties instead, but I'd never tried chanterelles before and I liked what they added to the recipe, even though mine were dried. Overall, a good taste, lots of flavors competing for attention (except the bacon - where did it go?), though I agree with another reviewer that it needed to be thicker - more "chowder-like". Also, one of the priciest recipes I've ever made!

This soup was very good and not difficult. I did all the chopping ahead of time so putting the soup together was easy. I couldn't find chanterelles so I used shiitakes. Next time I think I'll just skip the mushrooms. I think it would have been better without. The large amount of celery, leeks and onions makes this a very flavorful soup.

Didn't have fresh corn-on-the-cob, so just used frozen corn. Perhaps that's why it was bland. Even though used 1/2 & 1/2 rather than cream, it was too rich for our tastes. Wouldn't repeat.

This was the rave of a recent dinner party - as usual I improvised a bit: used 2 lrg. potatoes which was plenty - used cremini mushrooms which were wonderful - used dried thyme - and since it was easier, I used a 1# can of crab purchased @ Costco (like Sam's Club) which was wonderfully delicious! I had people ask for the recipe which is always a compliment! Definitely will make again !

Absolutely delicious and nice presentation, as well! We used fresh Dungeness crab, cracked and cleaned ourselves (which was fun to do with a great Sauvignon Blanc and our favorite tunes on the stereo!) This is an impressive dinner starter when served in small portions or a memorable main course! If you serve a salad with it and a baguette, keep the dressing light. Also great with a beautiful California chardonnay...

Wow. Quite possibly the best soup I have ever made, although I did make several substitutions and modifications. I couldn't find chanterelles, so I substituted them with crimini mushrooms. I'm not a fan of leeks or fennel seeds, so I used carrots instead and omitted the fennel altogether. Didn't feel like having corn that night, so I left that out too. I added a can of clams (juice and all) to add more of a seafood flavor to the broth. I also didn't portion the crab and bacon out like the recipe said--just threw them into the chowder during the last 3 minutes and let them simmer. The flavor and texture were amazingly good. I was kind of afraid the bacon and clams might overpower the flavor, but this was definitely crab chowder. Next time I make this, I'll try it with the corn and chanterelles (if I can find them!).

This recipe really wasn't too much work. And, the results were great. I cut the recipe in half since a lot of the other reviewers said that it seemed to make a lot. I had enough to feed 4 with leftovers for lunch the next day for my husband and I. I used Crimini mushrooms - chanterelles are not in season. And, I used whole milk rather than cream. It was definitely lighter, but delicious all the same.

This soup was a lot of work but everyone loved it. I used white button mushrooms since it is not mushroom season. I don't know if I would have sacrificed my chanterelles for this dish though. I used a combination of crab and prawns and liked the mixed textures and flavors. This is a nice change from the standard soup fare. It will feed more like 10 or more portions instead of 6-8.

This is the first recipe I have tried from this site that I would NOT make again. Overall it turned out okay, but very rich and heavy (as expected, I guess). It wasn't horrible, bu I suppose I am spoiled by having such fresh crab here in the Bay Area. I prefer it with melted butter and a nice Sancerre - period.

I made this chowder after first discovering it on the cover of the Jan. '03 issue of Bon Appetit magazine. I made a double batch for friends anticipating greatness... and it was fabulous! Being Alaskan, I used fresh Alaskan Dungeness Crab meat (I used a bit more than called for). I had plenty to send home with friends. One of my friends told me the next day that she raided her fridge at 2:00 am and had another bowl in bed! I will definietly make this chowder again.

What a waste of crab and chanterelles. This dish was a real disappointment with a lack of the taste and flavor that needs to grab you. I was really looking forward to making this and am looking for a much better crab and corn chowder recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a great chowder that should come with a minor cautionary note: only affordable if you live in the Pacific Northwest between October and November as our wild chanterelles appear in the market during those months. We're lucky that Dungeness is available all year and our pals from California have extended our fresh corn season considerably. Our morels usually spring up in, well, spring--I may even try the chowder using them.

My favorite dish from a recent dinner party - delicious. I used fresh Dungeness crab and fresh chanterelles from the farmer's market. There was no problem with overpowering the crab, as Dungeness is sweet and flavorful and can hold it's own. I grew up around the Chesapeake Bay and love Maryland Blues too, but there's no way you could taste the more delicate blue crab above the background of the other flavors in this soup. Definitely use Dungeness. I agree that the Chanterelles weren't worth it - there are plenty of other great Chanterelle recipes out there that use that mushroom to its advantage. Frankly, I would omit the mushrooms all together - they don't need a substitute.

Wow! This is delicious! I made this as one of eight courses for our wine club, and it was a huge hit. I followed the hints of previous reviewers and made a few changes. I used only 1 cup of sweet onions and ¾ tsp fennel seeds so as not to overpower the crab. I also added 20 oz of frozen corn and used unpeeled new potatoes...I would use one or two fewer potatoes next time. I used deli bacon and also added ¾ tsp of Old Bay. I used 8 oz crimini mushrooms, as the only chanterelles available were dried and VERY expensive. I spent my money on fresh Dungeness crab instead and increased the amount to 1 ½ pounds which resulted in oohhs and aahhs. I made this about 3 hours ahead to allow for the flavors to blend before adding the crab and mushrooms, and served it with a rich, buttery chardonnay. I would certainly make this again, with the same changes, and serve it as the main course along with a salad and crusty bread.

I wish I could have given this 2.5 forks. I thought it was good but not great. I used dried chantrelles and fresh baby portabellos. Like some other reviewers, I too feel that the combination of ingredients overpowered the taste of the crab. Being from Maryland I'm a little picky (pardon the pun) about crab recipes. I think I would prefer to try another cream of crab recipe in the future.

Rating: 3
Very good. Living on the Oregon Coast I have easy access to dungeness crab and chanterelles. I used half and half in place of half of the cream, only because I was too lazy to go the store and used organic frozen corn because fresh wasn't available that day. Definitely would make it again.

Rating: 3
This was a very good soup, but I do feel that the flavor of the crab was a bit overpowered by the other ingredients. I didn't use chanterelle mushrooms either. At $39.99 a pound for fresh chanterelle mushrooms, I calculated that I would be spending almost $20 on the mushrooms alone, and felt that was a ridiculous amount of money to spend. I substituted oyster mushrooms instead. I also used frozen corn instead of fresh. Still, all in all, a yummy soup which my husband loved.

I made this as part of a soup buffet dinner party and it was the absolute favorite. It takes some time, but was well worth the effort. The dungeoness crab was perfect with the broth. The broth was delicious on its own and several guests ate it that way.

I'm not a huge fan of cream-based soups but this was very good - especially on a cold winter night! I halved the recipe since I was only making it for two people. I made the following substitutions: used frozen organic sweet corn instead of fresh, used baby portabellas instead of chanterelles and used unpeeled new potatoes cut into one inch cubes. I also used a whole can (1 lb) of crab meat. It was chock-full of crab - any less would not be as good. Overall this was not too difficult to make, tasty and looked nice. It was even good the next day. The bacon is essential- it added a great flavor.

I made this soup with some Alaskan king crab and frozen corn. This cut the prep time considerably. I used half and half in place of some of the cream. It was delicious. Everyone had seconds. Serve with a great crusty bread and you have a terrific meal.

Chesapeake Bay blue crabs are THE WAY to go. When the crabs are in season, so is silver queen corn - from Maryland, for those West Coasters. I also used pre-chopped mushrooms (cello, I think) that were fine. And being from MARYLAND, I used a few dashes of Old Bay Seasoning. Yummy!

DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper. I used the dried chanterelles. Unless the fresh are completely different, I'd opt for another less expensive mushroom next time. Fortunately, fresh Dungenesse crab was on sale at my butcher. I used frozen petite sweet corn. Not knowing the equivalents for off-the-cob, I used 1 and 1/2 10 ox. bags of frozen corn. I also pureed half the potatoes, and it made a nice, creamy base. I can't wait to make this for company!

This recipe just didn't seem to work for me. The crab and the chanterelles get overpowered. I think, were I to make it again, I'd use prawns (which are only *slightly* less expensive here in NM than crab is), and a more robust mushroon like crimini.

TO RAY FROM DAYTON: If you want to thicken the soup without adding cornstarch or flour, you could puree half the potatoes, or add a can or two of cream corn.

The soup was very nice, but I thought much of the flavor of the very, very expensive fresh crab meat was lost. (I enjoyed it more picking it out of the pan while I was sauteeing the crab than in the soup). Perhaps prawns would be a less expensive alternative and would keep the flavor.

This was a very, very good chowder. A few alterations done here due to availability.... frozen corn for fresh, and shiitake and white mushrooms for the chanterelle's. Very delicious, and would be a very elegant or fancy dish if you wanted. The fennel seed and then the thyme add such good flavors with the sweet crab and corn. I probably added a tad more than the required sherry too. And just added the crab into the soup at the end instead of mounding in the bowls. Also, another note, I used a gourmet meat market's specialty smoked bacon and it added such a wonderful, smoky flavor, so good bacon helps. Enjoy. It is well worth it.

This was a tremendous success at my wife's birthday dinner. I found that making the entire recipe up through the addition of the corn, then letting it sit in the pot, off the heat, for a few hours before sauteing the chanterelles and crabmeat and adding them, made it that much better. All soups need time, you know?

I thought this soup was good, but needed to be lightened up a bit. I used dried chantrelle mushrooms, since chantrelle mushrooms were $39.99/lb. at my local grocery store. I also added chopped tomatoes on top to give it more color and to help add a lighter flavor. Next time I'll cut down the cream or substitute some with half-and-half.

Added one can salt free creamed corn...crimini mushrooms..fennel bulb in place of seed..loved the chowder. If you can get Phillipps canned crab it is worth the price..just like fresh..check Costco. Well worth your time..Do make this. I used powdered thyme & herbs de provence for flavoring.

This was really good, even though I dinked around with the recipe. I only used 1 cup of cream, substituting evaporated skim milk for the rest. I didn't have fresh ear corn, so I used frozen kernels. Also I didn't have anything but plain button mushrooms. All in all, it was really, really good. Next time, if I'm serving to guests, I'll use all cream and the right mushrooms. I'll also have to find better crab...mine was frozen lump, and it didn't have a big, chunky texture. Not cheap, but well worth it.
