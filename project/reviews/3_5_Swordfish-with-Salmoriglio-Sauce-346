I've been preparing this for 15 years and it's always well received. A simple, basic recipe where the fish is the star. Your side dishes need color and fuller flavors.

I made Debra's Marcella Hazan recipe (posted under reviews) last night and it was delicious! Got tons of compliments. Didn't bother with the original recipe since it got lukewarm reviews. Thanks Debra!

I made this last night and it was well-received (although I only did 2 8oz swordfish steaks and adjusted amounts accordingly) It would be nice if the sauce was a bit thicker, but we can't win them all. Goes especially well with the Italian Stuffed Mushrooms. (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Italian-Stuffed-Mushrooms-107837?cached=F&savedReview=true)

As good as this is, Marcella Hazan's recipe is better. Try it and compare: 1/4 cup olive oil, 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, 1 tablespoon salt and freshly ground pepper. Mix lemon juice and salt, add olive oil and oregano and pepper to taste. Grill swordfish unadorned and drizzle sauce immediately after fish is off grill. Make sauce as fish grills because freshness is key. No need for parsley or garlic.

I'll give this another try. However, I expected the flavor of the sauce to be more pronounced. I marinaded the swordfish for a couple of hours. The sauce did not do for the swordfish what my oregano-oil-lemon marinade does for chicken. I think I'll stick to the North African rub from this site or the olive relish topping for swordfish.

This was good, but not quite in the four fork category. I prepared the swordfish on a stove top grill pan; it might be better on a real fire or under the broiler. I was cooking for two and was too tired to divide all the ingredients by three, so I made the full sauce amount and put the rest of it on a pound of spaghetti, planning on leftovers for pasta salad. There weren't a whole lot of leftovers, although my husband is a pasta hound. Still, the sauce was very tasty, a bit more interesting than basic olive oil and garlic sauce, which I make all the time. Finally, I didn't happen to have a double boiler to make the sauce, and I don't see why it's necessary. It turned out great in my smallest all-clad pot directly on the stove.

I agree with the cook from NYC; this is the best swordfish ever! Grilled it along with split beefsteak tomatoes sprinkled with olive oil and sea salt and asparagus packets and served with feta and mint rice. Used fresh oregano and mint from the garden which I think made a significant difference. Awesome meal, definitely fit for company and easy, too.

Similarly, I made a few enhancements to the recipe. I marinated in the sauce like many others. I also added a few scallops (marinated as well) and sauteed them. Topped the swordfish with both the reserved sauce and scallops. As always, doubled the garlic. Served with couscous. A very good recipe- the sauce taste and acidity went well with the swordfish and scallops.

Yes, it is very good. Marinate, don't marinate, I marinated for a half hour with lemon juice, zest, garlic, olive oil, and salt. The best part was that it came out crunchy on the outside, and juicy on the inside in the broiler. Very tasty. I will make it for my husband when he gets home from Seattle.

This is unbelievably good. I marinated the swordfish for about an hour and then grilled. It is the best swordfish my husband and I have ever eaten.

Great recipe! Could be a little spicier in my opinion. The extra sauce that you put on the swordfish after grilling and just before serving is key!

I ran short of time so I couldn't marinate the fish. Next time for sure I'll marinate. I served it on a bed of arugala (with the extra sauce as a dressing) and broiled thick sectioned tomatoes with salt, pepper and fresh pressed garlic which I cooked under the broiler with the fish. That was great and the colors of the presented dish was stunning. Tried the bow-tie pasta recommended by another commentor and loved the combo. I will definitely look forward to Marinating! This is a keeper.

Good swordfish recipe. I marinated the fish for about an hour which kept the fish juicy even though it was more like 3/4" thick and took awhile to brown slightly under the broiler. Served with bow tie pasta with butter and fresh grated parmesan.

Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow (four Wow's) After incorporating the suggestions of two of the previous reviewers (marinate in the sauce for a couple of hours & slice the garlic don't chop) I added one of my own (double the garlic) and this recipe just rocked !!! Suttle so you still taste the fish but you just can't get enough sauce on each bite. This recipe is a winner, that I will make over and over again. Can't wait to try this on center cut loin chops.

Don't eat fish- but RAVE reviews from the table, and many requests for the recipe.

This is one of the better recipes I've made from this website. Nice to make when company comes over, always impresses.

Loved this! I was making the meal for two, but made the salmoriglio sauce as it was called for. I marinated as was suggested (great idea!) and what sauce wasn't being for used for the fish, I used as the base for twice baked potatoes. What a hit! With a simple salad of bibb, endive and red onion, the meal was great. Even my not-swordfish-loving husband gave it thumbs up.

This was surprisingly good, in spite of my first attempt to grill on my gas grill, and then broiling it because I ran out of gas! I agree with previous posters that it's probably better to broil this. I used lots of fresh oregano from my garden and marinated it for 2 hours in the fridge. I really liked the way the lemon flavor came through, and my husband said it tasted like something from a restaurant. The fish was moist and tender and delicious. Will make again.

Stuck in the city without access to anywhere to plunk a bbq, we broiled the swordfish and were pleasantly surprised by how tasty this recipe was. We served it with a mushroom risotto, but next time will serve it with something that won't steal the limelight. Next time we'll also marinate and use more oregano. Great, easy, delicious.

This was good, but as far as it being an excellent "recipe," it is just basic common sense cooking.

Stuck with the basic recipe and the results were terrific.

This was delicious! We just bought a gas grill and I was unsure about it. I forgot parsley and used basil instead. I'd love to try fresh oregano next time. Fantastic! We felt like champion chefs.

I have been making this ever since the special Italy issue came out years ago. Jo said it best -- "It doesn't get much better than this." We absolutely love this sauce on swordfish as well as other fish. I will have to try fresh oregano next time, and will also marinate the fish as recommended by one person. Absolutely perfect recipe!!

It doesn't get much better than this. This is the perfect balance of flavor without masking the character of the fish. I used fresh oregano and marinated the fish for 2 hours as the previous reviewer directed. Trust the Scicilians to get seafood just right!

This was so tasty. I marinated the swordfish in the chilled sauce for approx 2 hours. This was ample time as it gave a swordfish such nice flavor. My guests enjoyed it. I made the marinade in the morning and added the swordfish before guests arrived.

This is the sauce my Sicilian grandmother would prepare for fish and chicken (use bone-in breasts, legs, thighs and marinate the chicken for the better part of a day, grill. Skin-on helps to keep the moisture in while grilling.). I have taken to marinating the swordfish steaks in this sauce for an hour before grilling them. Use fresh oregano if you have it, but the oregano is key. Without it, the sauce has no "depth". And instead of minced garlic, I cut the cloves into slivers. This is a terrific dish!

Very Delicious! I made this previously in August and it was OK (I think my husband over-grilled the fish) but this time I broiled it and it was FANTASTIC! We both agreed it was truly a great sauce for swordfish.

My husband and I served this to nine of our family friends along with the Minted Saffron Rice. It was a delicious hit. The sauce is quick, the swordfish grill quickly. Plenty of time to spend enjoying our own party.
