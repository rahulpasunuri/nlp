Made exactly as recipe instructs, but fried in canola oil instead. Very tasty!

A little more labor intensive then my Mothers version. We just used left over mashed potato, added, 1 egg, and a little bread crumbs, then dipped them in crumbs and fried them.

Delicious! I make a modified version of these using manchego rather than mozerella and I really think it improves the dish tremendously! try it and I'm sure you'll agree.

served it with applesauce and sour cream and it was great! alone it might have been just barely too dry/bland. but delicious with the condiments
