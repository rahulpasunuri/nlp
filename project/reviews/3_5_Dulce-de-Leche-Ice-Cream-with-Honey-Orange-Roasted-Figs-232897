This is heaven! I like it best over vanilla ice cream, but it's also good with honeyed goat cheese, or Greek yogurt. The sauce is incredibly rich, and as yummy as the figs. Don't worry about overcooking it, the figs will just carmelize more. This is one where only a few ingredients, and little effort or time, pays huge dividends.

Very simple, but with such a complex flavor. I liked these even better after a night in the fridge (firms the figs up a little). I didn't try them with ice cream, but delicious with plain greek yogurt.

Delicious! I made a healthy version by serving the roasted figs with homemade yogurt. I roasted the figs as called for except I added a little fresh ground pepper and salt. This is good for a healthy dessert or breakfast.

I ate this with goat cheese instead of ice cream, a take on a dessert I had maybe 10 years ago someplace in Santa Fe. Yum yum yum. Saved some to try on ice cream later.

Maybe I'm just not a fig-lover. This was pretty much a yawn at my house, although the ice cream was well-received.

Hurry! Run! Make this dish while fresh figs are still in season. It was absolutely wonderful and super simple. I really liked it with Dulce de Leche ice cream as suggested, but I'm sure it would be just as good over vanilla.
