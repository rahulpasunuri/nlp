Quite possibly one of the very best soups I've ever tried. Made it following the recipe exactly as described and it was exquisite. I had a few friends over for dinner and they simply could not get enough of it--I thought I had made enough to have leftovers to enjoy the next day but they ate it all before I could sneak some into a tupperware!

Made it exactly as specified. Everyone loved it! There was enough for 12 bowls, maybe more. We were stuffed after just one serving but couldn't resist having another - yes, it's quite filling! Surprisingly there are probably only about 500 calories per serving. The pureed tofu adds a creamy flavor and texture without all the fat.

Yum! Didn't change a thing, though next time I might use less PB. I'm also kind of kickign around the idea of adding coconut milk next time. But it is really good as is. Makes a ton!

Made this for the first time today and was in love at first taste. I followed the recipe closely, and the end result was both luxurious and surprisingly light all at once. Only pureeing a portion (~2 cups) of the soup as the recipe suggests worked well for me from a textural standpoint as I found myself looking forward to the chunky pepper-onion-sweet potato combo with every bite. The only minor modification I made was that I added a few squirts of fresh lime juice right before serving, which "cut" and balanced out the flavors nicely with a light touch of brightness.

Love this recipe, and it is SO easy. I typically don't cook, but this is what I make when I want to impress the guests. I blend my tofu with the broth and then add it to the rest of the soup- gives it a creamy consistency. It's AMAZING. And, to cut down on the fat, I use Better n Peanut Butter, which has 2.5 grams of fat per TBSP (2.5... not a typo!). Tastes just the same as reg. ole PB when used in the soup. I use nearly the whole jar of it, and then eat the remains as I cook.

This may well be my favorite soup in the world. I don't add tofu (sensitivity to soy), rice (no need) or scallions (no need). Otherwise I make it according to the recipe - more or less. One bowl is never enough. The combination of peanuts, sweet potato and ginger is heavenly.

Excellent soup, and very easy and quick to make, once the vegetables were prepped. I doubled the cayenne to 1/2 t., but found that wasn't nearly enough. Next time I'd start with 1 t. and up it from there if needed. It ended up tasting like tomato soup, with added interest. I pureed it, leaving a few chunks of vegetables floating about. It had a nice thick texture and the tofu is undetectable. I used a whole container of tofu instead of a half (as I feared that I would just find the unused half container moldy in the back of the fridge one day). Also, I felt the rice was unnecessary at the end and the scallions didn't add much; they could easily be eliminated.

Great soup - although more like a stew (but I added water until it was desired consistency). As another reviewer, I used a can of Rotel tomatoes (instead of the crushed tomatoes and cayenne) and also added two sliced jalapenos. I added peanut butter to taste (1/2 c, less than called-for) and blended a portion of the soup with 1/2 of a 12oz carton of firm tofu. Great over Kashi 7-grain rice blend and sprinkled with fresh lime juice and cilantro (no scallions). Would also be great over Asian noodles. The broth before adding the PB and tofu was fantastic and I will make that variation as a brothy soup in the future.

Delicious and hearty...exactly what I look for in a soup! The sweet potatoes make the dish for me. I would also think about making the soup without the peanut butter on other occasions for a different flavor (maybe with some small pasta instead of rice) because the base is so delicious. As I was tasting I made a few minor changes: I added a tablespoon of lime juice and a tablespoon of chopped cilantro at the very end to brighten it slightly, and included a little extra ginger as well. I also withheld 1 cup of vegetable broth to keep a thicker consistency. Next time I will probably try it with cubed tofu, but since my boyfriend isn't a big tofu fan, blending it in was a good way to incorporate it without freaking him out. Hes a carnivore through and through but he LOVED this soup. Will I make this again? YES!!

We used firm tofu instead of soft and pureed as described. Worked great. Terrific recipe!

Rating: 4
I must admit, I leave out the tofu! I think the recipe is great without it, and the tofu slightly waters down the taste of the veggies and peanut butter. The recipe also makes a HUGE pot of soup. I cut it in half, and then freeze some. I've made this for both family and friends, and they voraciously finish the pot!

Made this with my 9 year old daughter tonight, as she picked it to make for a soup competition. It won for best texture out of about 20 soups! Great flavor and easy to make...thumbs up. We just cubed some firm tofu instead of blending with soft, and skipped the rice as the sweet potatoes gave great density to the whole thing. Will be making it again for sure

This turned out really well; I left out the tomato and added an additional sweet potato -- that is just my taste. I love sweet potato and peanut butter and didn't want those flavors eclipsed by tomato. Also, I added additional ginger and a little extra garlic and I'm glad I did. I pureed the entire thing.

this soup was great, i made 3 servings instead of 6. i didn't serve with rice and i didn't add the tofu. I used 1 raw sweet potato, peeled and cubed. and boiled it while i was prepping. By the time i was ready the potato was soft. I added 1 diced thai chili for some extra kick. I only had creamy peanut butter but i had some peanuts on hand that i chopped up and mixed with it. I pureed the whole soup with an immersion blender. It came out great and i would definalty make it again.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was disappointed in this soup. It wasn't bad - just really bland. I'd probably make it again 'cause it's pretty healthy, but it needs more spices!

this was pretty good -- i had to use 1/4c more peanutbutter and I used soysauce instead of salt

Very rich and good! Followed advice of others and added extra ginger--half at the designated time and half a few minutes before the end of the simmering time. Added about 1/4 cup of cilantro and a tablespoon of honey just before serving. Will definitely make again.

I add a couple of tsps of chipoltle peppers in adobo sauce and puree the whole pot of soup with my stick blender. For those in my family that want "meat" in the soup, I add a bag of frozen seafood mix and a bag of frozen salad shrimp from Trader Joe's. I rarely use the rice.

Absolutely amazingly delicious! I added 3 tablespoons minced ginger because I just love the flavor, and I also added more garlic and peanut butter. yum! I used firmer tofu, and pureed about 1/3 of it with some of the soup and added the rest in cubes at the end, where they did not look odd, as it stated in the recipe intro. It looked fine and it added a nice textural layer and flavor that contrasted nicely with the rest of the soup.

Amazing! Would definitely make again, although I found the scallions to be a bit much for the delicate soup.. will try garnishing leftovers with cilantro...

A complete meal in a pot. YUM! Delicious without all that "tinkering" recommended by the previous reviewer. (I don't understand how anyone could burn the tofu to the bottom of the pan either) I did increase the garlic and ginger because I love the flavors.

***I had a hard time getting a great-tasting soup out of this recipe, but after a lot of patience and experimentation, I'm here to tell you that there is potential here. You just have to take it one step further, or you're stuck with a very bland, "healthy-tasting" soup that people will yawn at. What did I do? Simple. I decided to puree the entire soup. After making the soup Exactly As Written, I felt that the tofu-flavor was too prominent, so I simmered the entire soup for an additional twenty minutes. I waited one full day before making a verdict. (Soup always takes a day to figure itself out.) The next day, the soup tasted more developed, but in my opinion, had little flavor. In Olive Oil, I sauteed 2T Fresh Giner, 4 Minced Garlic Cloves, and 2 Jalapenos. I pureed these ingredients with a cup of the soup until everything was smooth and silky. I then added this concoction to the soup, as well as several liberal dashes of cayenne. I simmered the soup for twenty minutes. As can be expected, the soup became very thick, so I added a cup of water to thin it out a bit. The ingredients I added Really Helped, and from this point, I added enough salt to bring out the spices. The next day, the soup tasted INCREDIBLE!! Peanutty, Gingery, Garlicky, Smooth and Thick. Its one of the best soups I've ever made in my entire life. So thats my advice: LOTS of Cayenne, Ginger, Garlic and Patience. (NOTE: The tofu in this recipe will stick to the bottom of your kettle and begin to burn!! Scrape the bottom constantly, and keep the flame low once the tofu is added. Its a pain in the butt, so be careful.)

Disclaimer: I like African food in general. I absolutely love this soup! I followed the advice of LFinkelstein from Santa Cruz, CA, in that I used a liberal dash of cayenne, used about 3.5 teaspoons of ginger, and a little over a cup of peanut butter. This soup is perfect for a winter day. I made it more like a stew, though: I didn't want to puree the tofu or the vegetables since I wanted to preserve the distinct flavours of each one. Instead, I used firm tofu, chopping it in 1/4 inch dice, and adding it at the end. I also used no black pepper since I'm not in the mood for it lately. It was amazing. I can't wait to serve it to my vegetarian friends. (This time I used a chicken stock so for them I'll use vegetable stock). It's delicious and packed with vitamins. Plus, it amount to a ton of food. I would say it serves more like 8. Since I live alone I'll be enjoying this delicious soup for a week!

This was a beautiful stew (not really like a soup as I only blended some of it and left the rest chunky) for a cold night. I found that I needed to triple the cayanne to get any heat, and a bit more pb made it more tasty. I also added more ginger than called for. When it was done it was missing something and I found that lime juice helped to make the flavors shine. Mmmm. This will be made again on another cold night!

I love food for two seperate reasons -- because it is delicious(ice cream & chocolate) or because it's highly nutritious and energizing -- and rarely do the two coincide in one food. This soup is one of those rare foods that does both. Great blend of flavors; after my second bowl I thought, "Hey, I could live on this!"

i substituted a yellow pepper for the green one and pureed the soup. It was beautiful to look at and tasted even better. A favorite with my family of picky eaters.

rather on the bland side I'd have to say. doubled the cayenne, tripled the salt. It is helped with some lime juice. I had to serve over brown rice and steamed broccoli to give it some meaningful texture/color/etc. was so excited - I think next time I might cut the tofu in half?

Wonderful recipie! The tofu makes it thick and creamy like a cream-based soup but is much more healthy. I blend everything and serve it with toast rather than over rice.

I liked how subtle the peanut flavor was. I added some cumin and coriander and substituted the tomatoes and cayenne with rotelle tomatoes. I liked how the tofu and peanut butter both thickened and made the soup creamy. I plan to use the leftovers over rice, chicken and broccoli.

this was nice but the sweet potatoes didn't seem to add anything special. i also just ground up my own peanuts to a paste, which seemed to work. i think it lacked one strong flavour though - maybe peanut butter adds more. will try tweaking this recipe but it's a good start. the ginger is a nice touch.

This was a fabulous soup and I only tried it because of the positive reviews. It is really mis-named. I think it should be called Tomato Peanut Soup with Sweet Potatoes. Even without the brown rice it's fine. The peanut flavor is very subtle, and it's very thick, rich and filling.

Wow! I was looking for something that was not run-of-the-mill with bell peppers, and this recipe was it! I only used 1 onion, 1 potato instead of sweet potatoes, and no garlic --- but it still tasted GREAT! Definitely cream the soup with tofu at the end - it adds something special!

This soup was good but the peanutbutter flavor overwhelmed the lovely veggies. Next time I think I would cut back on that.

A very nice soup. Healthy, with subtle peanut flavoring. But what does "1 box or 1/2 carton tofu" mean? I used a 300 gram container. (Is it a box? or a carton? Beats me.)

My husband and I loved this dish even though we both don't usually like bell peppers. I added a can of coconut milk at the end but I think the creaminess from the pureed tofu was actually enough. We'll make this again and again.

This is really close to 4 forks! First time I made it, I pricked a habanero, added it for about 15 min, then took it out before serving (in place of the crushed red pep). Second time, used red japs. Both were excellent! My husband LOVES it.
