This is a great do ahead recipe. Have made it twice for dinner parties of six and eight. Did not make gnocchi. Purchasd from local pasta shop. Did place in nutmeg butter prior to serving. Made lamb Ragu day ahead and just heated for 45 minutes day of dinners. Served with fresh grated parmesan on top. Excellent.

Marcella Hazan never uses eggs in her potato gnocchi, and neither do I. Nice ragù, though.

AWFUL!!!!!! Complete waste of time and money.

This went absolutely horrifically for me. The sauce was decent, but the gnocchi... Nothing went well, not a promising first attempt at the job for me personally. I followed the recipe to the t, and it seemed to be going well at first, but then the egg was added and the dough turned to mush. Countless cups of flour attempted to rescue it, but through it all, the flavor of the potato was lost and much too much was made for the amount of sauce. I'll be looking for another gnocchi recipe, for sure.

Just cooked the sauce over fresh pasta, not gnocchi... Added onions and shallots to the garlic in the beginning, and then flavored the simmering sauce with some sugar, shallot salt, red pepper flakes, oregano, basil and a dash of cinnamon. Also used crushed San Marzano tomatoes instead of chopped plum tomatoes. Turned out delicious!

This was so good! I did make some adjustments (I can never follow a recipe exactly) I bought the gnocchi at my local Italian Market. Used 3/4 ground lamb instead of the stew meat. I also substituted the white wine for 1 cup of Chianti. Since I increased the amount of wine I only added about 1/2 c of water. I also used canned tomatoes instead (28 oz can Rega Rega Pomodoro San Marzano Peeled Whole Tomatoes). I felt this dish needed more flavor so I added 3 cloves (minced) and didn't remove at the end and a pinch of red pepper flakes. After reading other reviews about the sauce being watery I simmered for 1 hours uncovered then 2 hours covered. I actually ended up adding a little water at the end because it was too thick. Over all a delicious dish. I will be making it again.

This was exceptionally wonderful winter comfort food. I tweaked, used thyme instead of rosemary, bought the gnocchi since it was a week night, and used a good quality 28 oz can of whole tomatoes diced fine instead of fresh. Noting what others said about the sauce not thickening, I used the tomatoes and juice and deglazed with a full 1/2 c of wine and vermouth but didn't add any water. I also let the sauce simmer uncovered for part of the time to reduce slightly. I added a pinch of nutmeg to the brown butter for the gnocchi because they don't usually add it to store bought, and this was absolutely delicious.

I bought gnocchi from my local Italian grocer and went searching for a recipe to use it in. I found this one and used ground lamb I had on hand rather than stew meat. I didn't change anything else in the recipe and we found it simply delicious. And, I must agree, how can you go wrong with lamb?

Lamb is just delicious so it's hard to mess this up. I agree with other reviewers that the dish is sort of plain in spite of that, though. We added mushrooms, onions and mint (during the fry phase), stewed for twice as long and boiled the gnocchi without salt (it's quite salty without). It came out wonderfully, but I suspect it would be a bit less interesting without the additions.

To A Cook on 01/16/09 . . . again with the plug of your own site? Can someone please take out all this person's reviews? They seem to only be used as free publicity.

This was delicious. Cooked it twice as long as suggested and added a can of crushed tomatoes to thicken and add body to the sauce. But it was great on the fresh gnochhi. Served with Green bean gratinate

While the sauce was Ok, not worth the time and effort. Unbalanced flavors, tomato and wine too strong. Not sure how to fix it, but not willing to sink in time to figure it out.

The gnocchi recipe was great, but a little bland and dry, so I added a little extra salt, a pinch of garlic powder, and a dash of yogurt to the dough. I also minced a shallot and diced a carrot into the melted butter over the stove, sauteeing them together and letting the butter brown before tossing it with the boiled gnocchi, which added a really nice depth and sweetness. The sauce was fantastic...but only because I didn't follow the recipe at ALL. I skipped the water in favor of about a quarter cup of tomato paste and about 3/4 cup of Malbec--why they say to use white wine is beyond me. I used 1 pound of ground lamb and a couple handfuls of chopped portobellos, which I added slightly after the garlic turned golden. Also, a pound of tomatoes is nowhere near enough--I used one pound of fresh plum tomatoes and then added a 14.5 oz. can of fire-roasted diced ones to the mix because it just wasn't enough. I let it sit and reduce for about two hours, skimming the fat off periodically, and...it was perfect. I also set some rosemary and basil aside and added it at the end along with a handful of grated Pecorino, right at the end. YUMMY, but use the recipe as a very rough template, not as a hard-and-fast instruction manual.

I chose this for a lesson in cooking with my daughter. It was pretty easy and very, very good. The Ragu is restaurant quality!

You can freeze the gnocchi after you shape them on a floured tray and then store them in freezer bags.

I made this for my family, and I agree that the sauce was too watery but delicious after cooking down. I want to make this again for a dinner party of approx 18, and I'm wondering if anyone has experience on making the gnocchi ahead? How much can I do in advance? I plan to make the ragu the day before and reheat (will this be fine do you think?), and then the most I'd like to do is put the gnocchi in to boil and then saute in butter. Will it stay if I make ahead and refrigerate? Finally, any tips on good apps to make with this dish? thanks.

I made this for our Valentine's Day main entree and it was a hit. I took other cooks' advice and added a small can of tomato paste. I also bought high quality gnocci to make the prep easier. The dish is rich so the servings can be on the smaller side.

I made this with a close Italian friend who loves to make everything from scratch. It was delicious and surprisingly easy. The lamb adds an air of sophistication without being complicated, and the gnocchi are so much more interesting than standard spaghetti. While the ragu was a bit watery, we just cooked it a little longer to let it reduce. Now that I've tested the recipe, I'm making it for a casual dinner party.

This was absolutely delicious - that is after adding a can of tomato puree. The sauce IS way too watery as previous reviewers have said. After the 1 1/2 hours of cooking I removed the meat reduced the liquid by half to get a delicious, potent broth. Then I added an entire can of high-quality tomato puree and simmered for another couple of hours. I added the meat back and it was absolutely lovely, thick and tasty. When I make it again I will do it exactly the same way.

Made this recipe for a casual dinner - the wife's sister and her family stopped by. The gnocchi were easy and very good. I also found the sauce to be rather watery, but really liked the flavour. Next time I might add a teaspoon or two of tomato paste just to thicken it up a mite.

Made this for Sunday dinner. Was surprised how easy it was after reading previous review--it literally took just 10 minutes to throw together the sauce and then left to cook while I took my daughter to Target to shop (again) for clothes. My sauce was a little watery too at end of cooking time, but I boiled it down and it got nice and saucy. My husband LOVED the ragu; I thought it was good not great but WOW~!!!!! the gnocchi are fantastic. Will definitely make them again. Incredibly easy dough to work with. I didn't use a fork to shape them. Instead, I rolled them down edges of a wire whisk. Not beautiful but much quicker.

Sorry to disappoint the previous reviewer, but I did not make the sauce. The gnocchi were great. I would make them smaller than 3/4", that's quite large. Followed gnocchi recipe exactly. They are quite soft. Sauteed them with onions, celery and green pepper in butter; then put in a bowl and sprinkled good prosciutto, grated hard cheese and some olive/truffle oil overtop. Tasty! It is not exactly a good-looking dish, I had trouble shaping the gnocchi nicely, so maybe not for company...but only if your guests care more how their food looks than how it tastes :-p

While one of the guests that I served this to thought it was one of the best things I've ever made, I was less impressed. My main problem with this dish is I just couldn't get the sauce to thicken. I finally ended up having to add some canned tomato sauce, which just killed me but after putting SO much time into this dish I couldn't give up. I probably ended up adding 1/2 a cup of the stuff. So un-saucy was this sauce, that I went back and re-read the recipe to make sure it didn't say to add CANNED tomatoes, but no. I hestiated over whether to say I'd make it again or not. If they'd had a "maybe" option I would have chose that. I'm anxious to hear what others have to say.
