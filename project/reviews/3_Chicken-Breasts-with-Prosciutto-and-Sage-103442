Made this a couple of Sundays ago for the family. Turned out well. I used powdered sage and if I try it again I'll try using fresh sage instead. My wife liked it.

We absolutely loved this recipe! Didn't really make any changes other than cooking the chicken breasts a bit longer bc they were quite thick. The sauce was wonderful!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I thought the combination of ingredients would be very flavorful, but it turned out very bland. I did use chicken cutlet instead of breasts which may be why it turned out dry, but the flavors just didn't blend. I would not make this again.

Delicious! I served this over herb-buttered noodles and my family gobbled it up.

I used boneless breasts dredged in seasoned flour (having flattened them a bit because they were very plump), and added diced red pepper. Also added some butter before returning them to the pan, and after flipping them I cut off the gas and let them finish cooking on residual heat. They came out very moist and the sauce was surprisingly good. I don't love it enough for a company-type special meal, but for something easy with ingredients I generally have on hand it's a keeper.

I agree with the cook from Philadelphia. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and found the recipe to be too bland.

Came out surprisingly dry and unappetizing in my experience.

Quick and easy enough for a weeknight but tastes like well-planned weekend food! Will definitely make again.

A variation on this is Patricia Wells' recipe for chicken breasts with sage in her "Trattoria" cookbook. It's done on the stove top and is very quick.

excellent, fantastic, love it!! have made this many times. it takes a little while, but its worth it. i add the proscuitto near the end so that it dosnt overcook.

I found the concept and the ingredients good, but the procedures were poor and backwards. First I added mushrooms and fresh peas still in the pods to the veggie list for color. I sauteed the veggies and proscuitto in a small amount of butter until just al dente. Removed veggies from pan. Then I added the oil and seared the chicken breasts on high heat 2 min. on one side for color before reducing the heat to low and adding maybe 1/2 cup chicken stock. (my chicken breasts were rather large). When chicken was almost done, the stock was almost gone. I added added in the wine first, to deglaze, and then the sage and the veggies again, to reheat for 2 minutes. Just before removing it from the pan, I added a tablespoon of butter to thicken the sauce. The colors/flavors of my veggies stayed fresh and the presentation was much nicer. Served with Roasted Garlic & Fennel Mashed Potatoes. Divine.

Good and simple. Subsitituted bonless skinless thighs because we like the moisture and flavor of dark meat. Also added some sliced mushrooms with the other veggies. Increased the wine to 3/4 cup and added before the prosciutto and sage to deglaze and mantain more flavor from the ham and sage. Served it with buttered orzo for a great Sunday night comfort meal. Agree it needs a colorful side to brighten the plate, but the flavors were wonderful - will try agin in the spring when I have fresh sage in the herb garden

I read the reviews before making this dish and I knew that the lack of color in the final presentation was a problem. I added about 1/3c total diced yellow, green and red peppers to the sauce and served the dish over "Vigo" brand yellow (saffron) rice. With these minor changes this became a very attractive and delicious dish.

I found this dish to be rather bland. It wasn't really chicken with a sauce, it was chicken with a mountain of pale looking vegetables and a bit of liquid. Maybe it's because I used boneless skinless chicken breasts. Since the dish didn't need to simmer as long as the recipe calls for, so the flavors didn't develop as much. Or maybe it's because the skin would have imparted more flavor. In any event, I don't think this recipe is worth trying again.

Apparently no one had the problem I had, which was that my plump boneless chicken breasts simply didn't cook through in the time specified. The sauce was delicious, and though I didn't mind the thin consistency, the washed-out carrots and celery did little for eye appeal. Next time, I might try boneless chicken breasts and a simpler sauce for a quicker dish.

This is a lovely dish, and very easy to make. I think it's going to be a regular dish for us.

This came out flavorful but dry. I think I'd like to experiment with coating the chicken in flour beforehand, adding the prosciutto and sage at the last minute to maintain the integrity of their texture and color, substituting unsalted chicken broth for some of the wine, and thickening the sauce somehow. Watch out for hidden sources of salt with this dish (adding extra prosciutto, substituting cooking wine, salting the chicken, using salted chicken broth), because the recipe already borders upon too salty. I definitely needed a bland grain as accompaniment.

I made this with a partner for a progressive dinner at Christmas. Everyone seemed to like the taste, but the presentation didnt turn out that well. Would definitely make this for another dinner party.

I changed it a bit by pounding down the chicken breast then coating with flour that was seasoned with salt and pepper. Added a little chicken broth to the sauce and when it came time I put one slice of prosciutto and one slice of provalone on top and put it under the broiler. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again and again.

My friends in Chicago made this one for dinner, it was superb! The presentation was excellent especially the fresh sage leaves. The blend of tastes were wonderful.

This is a recipe that my husband and I have on our regular rotation. It's easy, low-fat and very tasty! I agree with the fact that the sauce is a little runny, but when you serve it with mashed red potatoes, the sauce flavors everything!

This was pretty disappointing - quite bland. I often make roasted chicken breasts with prosciutto and fresh sage leaves tucked under the skin that is much tastier and easier to make than this dish.

This dish was great and easy to make. I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday and she raved about for days. Then she asked for the recipe! I will be definitely be making this again.

I have made this dish several times since it came out in the magazine. Not only with chicken but with duck brasts, quail(split) and Game Hens(split). It always turns out great. I always use fresh sage. I serve it with a simple rissotto. I will continue to make it.

I was a little worried about the visuals with this dish. Looked bland and salty to me. My employers, however, said "Delicious, please add it to the menu". Easy to prepare.

We used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and the sauce had a lot more flavor than we expected. It was absolutely delicious. This was also incredibly easy and quick to prepare and was relatively healthy.

I found the sauce too watery and would add a thickening agent or reduce it more. Also to simmer the chicken breasts 6 min. per side doesn't leave the skin crisp. What's the point of leaving the skin on if it isn't crisp.

I was surprised how tasty this was. I browned the chicken breasts on one side only. Didn't use the celery because I didn't have any; used frozen sliced carrots because I didn't have fresh; and used minced prosciutto. The smell of this cooking wasn't particularly appetizing and I thought for sure I was going to pitch it but by the time it was ready to be served all the flavors melted together nicely. Even my unreasonably fussy husband liked it. I didn't have the problem of the prosciutto becoming chewy as other reviewers did. Probably because my prosciutto was minced extremely fin

This was a good recipe for after work. It presents well and you don't have to slave. I added the prosciutto after I turned the chicken for the last 6 min. to prevent drying out. This dinner was perfect.

I agree with the cook from Edmonton. The prosciutto came out over cooked. If I were to try this again I'd cook the chicken in oil longer instead of simmering it for 6 minutes a side in the sauce and I'd add the prosciutto at the last minute. I think a better recipe would use some sort of heavy cream sauce instead of the celery and carrots.

Rating: 3
Very tasty! Even though I did not salt the chicken, the dish came out too salty because I did the unspeakable and used white cooking wine, which contains some salt. Be sure to use regular white wine because the prosciutto contains enough salt for the entire dish. Because I had trouble mixing in the sage evenly once the chicken was in the skillet, next time I will mix in the wine, prosciutto, and sage just before I add the chicken. Maybe using a Dutch oven instead of a skillet would have made mixing easier. And yes, wild rice would have been a great balance for my slightly-salty version of this dish. I do agree with the reviewer who said that the colors faded greatly during cooking, but it still tasted excellent.

Fabulous! So easy and so tasty. My wife, our guest and even our 2 year old daughter LOVED it! I served it with wild rice and steamed asparagus. What a meal! The leftovers lasted until the next breakfast (!)

This was good but not great. The aromas as it cooked were mouth-watering, but the finished product lacked richness. As well, the colours of the ingredients faded quite a bit during cooking, and the entree looked a lot less appetizing on the plate than it did in the skillet.

This is a delicious, easy recipe! It's also pretty healthy -- I paired it with a long grain & wild rice mix and steamed asparagus, along with a dry chardonnay -- what a great dinner. Definitely suitable for company fare, and even my husband (who doesn't care for "fancy" cooking :) ) loved it. I added a few other herbs the second time I made it; basil, tarragon, and parsley. I also prepare it doubled, using a whole package of chicken breasts, and I halve the amount of white wine called for, subbing chicken broth for the remainder of the liquid. This mix of broth & wine in the sauce was really quite good! I also omitted celery, since we both dislike that. We serve the extra sauce over the chicken and wild rice. What a great recipe! A new "chicken-night" staple for my house.
