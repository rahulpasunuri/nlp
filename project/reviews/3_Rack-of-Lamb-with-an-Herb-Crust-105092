It's "an herb". It is also "an hotel", "an history", etc. Originally the h was not pronounced. The usage may be dying out but that does not make it incorrect.

BTW, it's A herb not An herb.

This dish was overly complicated. The herb crust was difficult to apply and the roasted garlic wasn't worth the effort. Neither added much to the overall effect. I would suggest making a rub of the herbs and oil, baking as directed, and broil/grill to finish at the last minute. Finish with a drizzle of the port wine reduction. For the port wine reduction, I used my own brown glaze and got really good results. I don't know how many cooks keep a fresh supply of lamb stock around or if you could buy it (or if you would want to.) One other complicated aspect of this recipe.

I made this receipe for my husband last night. Instead of using a rack of lamb I used a leg and roasted it in the oven. It was Fabulous. My husband almost ate the whole thing!

We didn't care for this recipe at all. The herb crust did not add much and the sauce was thin. The shallots were nice, though. Can't believe it's a Cordon Bleu recipe. I wouldn't bother making it again.

This recipe is just what I was looking for. I had a similar recipe and misplaced it. Will let you know how it worked. I enjoy Epiurious very much...
