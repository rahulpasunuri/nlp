Just made this for guests and it was a hit. The sweet pastry dough worked out quite well - and I am not that experienced with making pastry dough! I do however agree with comment to avoid firm plums b/c they are quite tart.

Wonderful recipe - a little extra effort for a summer recipe but worth it - Up the anise seeds and I used half whole wheat flour - even better the next day for breakfast - yum

I used the filling from this recipe and just baked it as a one-crust pie. I also arranged circular slices of plum in a rosette pattern -- very, very pretty. This tasted great, but it never entirely congealed. There was quite a bit of liquid seeping out. I'd like to make it again and throw in a touch of tapioca or flour. Any other suggestions?

A couple of summers ago, I tastes some of the most deliciously sweet plums that I looked for a plum dessert recipe to take advantage of the fruit while they were in season. I chose a winner! The combination of the pine nuts, plums and anise seeds is very nice. I would definitely make again, and the only reason I have not is because there are so many other delicious recipes to try!

This was really excellent. The flavors were simple, but also very special. I used whole wheat flour, because it was all I had on hand, and I think it made the dish all the more rustic. One of my guests declared it one of the best desserts he's had in a long while.

I made this tart for a birthday party. And even those guests who in general do not eat cakes where asking for second helping. It is really delicious!

This is the one of the simplest desserts I've ever made. The dough is a cinch to toss together. I used italian (prune) plums because I read in a different Gourmet recipe that they bake better. The results were wonderful, not at all tart and does not require additional sugar. I'd definitely make this one again.

Absolutely delicious! The flavor of the anise and the pine nuts are a magnificent mix with the sweetness of the fresh plums. The recipe and the preparations are simple and easy to undestand. It's a keeper!!!

Overall, I liked this recipie. The plum, pine nut, and anise seed combination gave it an unusual taste; I liked it, but it was very distinctive so some people may not. I thought I had picked firm-ripe plums, but they turned out to be VERY sour. I served this with vanilla ice cream, and it definitely needed the extra sweetness. The final product looks very impressive!

This was the hit of the 4th of July Barbeque! Beautiful, delicious, and the hint of anise added a wonderful complexity. The pastry dough was a dream to work with -- very malleable. I added a little vanilla ice cream on the side. My husband says, "Don't loose this recipe!"

Although I rated this recipe a 2 and said I would make it again, both answers need explanations. Regarding the 2, the raw plums were very sweet however when cooked they became very tart. The next time I try this recipe, I will increase the sugar by 1.5%. Also the pastry was very short. Next time, I will make it with a tried and true sweet dough pastry. Instead of the wax paper I used parchment paper and just rolled out the pastry. I then transferred the paper to a pizza tray with the pastry on it and cooked it that way. It worked very well.
