This has become my staple summer BBQ pasta salad. A couple key things. Quality ingredients are KEY here. It makes the difference between a mediocre salad and a great one! Make sure you get fresh mozzarella and don't skimp on the fresh basil. I find fusilli to be better than rotini (as the recipe states) as the sauce really sticks in those crevices!

I've made this a million times, and love it. This last time, I realized (too late) that I didn't have enough pasta, and so I substituted a bag of Harvest Grains from Trader Joe's. This accident made is healthier and more delicious -- I would highly recommend!

This has become my go-to pasta salad for the summer! I've made it 3-4 times. Flavorful, easy. I do add a bit more of the dressing (maybe make a recipe and a half), and I use whole wheat pasta. Delicious! Always a winner.Good even if you make it the night before.

I always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe when I make this dish. I sometimes up the sun-dried tomatoes a little bit. The quality of the pasta you use also contributes to the end result.

Wow, I can't believe the ratings are so high for this. As is, we found it to be a waste of otherwise tasty ingredients we love. Somehow it ended up tasting less fresh and interesting than something i could get in a jar for $2 and throw in pasta. We ended up doctoring it, but still would never make this again.

Added sauteed zucchini and sliced grilled artichokes (jarred is fine) to make it a more well-rounded vegetarian dish.

Fantastic recipe. I tossed the drained pasta with some pesto first which gave it great flavor in addition to the dressing. I sprinkled parm over it all and tossed  didn't measure. It was really delicious.

I got rave reviews when I made this for a 4th of July potluck. Just reading the ingredients, I couldn't see what was so special about the recipe, but it was all about the "dressing". A great way to make a pasta salad, and the leftovers were good in toasted baguette.

I've made this salad several times for trips to wine country, and it is always a hit. Add chopped grilled chicken and you have a great entree for a summer picnic. I usually increase the amount of dressing a bit as the first time I made this it was a touch dry. I use the olive oil that the tomatoes are packed in for extra flavor and add chopped artichoke hearts immediately before serving.

To my surprise, I was very disappointed with this pasta salad. Not many of the guests at my bbq enjoyed it either. The pasta salad seemed to be too dry, needing to be tweeked a bit. If I try this recipe again, perhaps I too would add more olive oil and not process the sun-dried tomatoes.

Rating: 4
The best pasta salad. I don't think I will ever go back to the normal boring pasta salads you usually find at a summer BBQ. The dressing is amazing, definitely make a little extra. Kalamata olives and artichoke hearts are great in it. I also took the advice from some others and went to Trader Joes. They have everything and for great prices. Their marinated mozzarella balls are perfect for this salad. I cut them in half, along with grape tomatoes and found them the perfect size. My dad (who is the pickiest eater I know) raved about the sauce. Even though he picked everything else out. :)

Yummy and easy! Used farfalle (bow tie) pasta and Kalamata olives instead. Also added pine nuts and artichoke hearts. Will make again - soon!

I have made this recipe twice and I love how easy it is to adapt to certain tastes. As with other cooks, when I made this as written it came out a bit dry. I recommend using 3/4 of a pound of pasta instead of 1 pound. Also, I increased the amount of olive oil and lessened the amount of grated cheese.

We really enjoyed this. I used whole wheat penne and, though I tasted it for reasons of authenticity of review first, I added some wonderful local smoked sausage I had browned and was trying to use after. It was very good as written and even better with the smoked sausage which made a very hearty, rustic summer salad.

This recipe is fantastic and one that the entire family adores. I've made it several times each summer for the past four or five years. Generally use pitted Kalamata since I can't buy Oilcured that are pitted at my local grocery and double the capers.

I did not like this salad at all, as a matter of fact, I hate to say, but I tossed all of the leftovers (such a waste of usually delicious ingredients!). My dressing basically had the consistency and appearance of slightly watered-down tomato paste. I may use the same ingredients, but move the sundried tomatoes (chopped) and capers to the salad and then just add a simple vinaigrette (maybe move the basil to the dressing?). As written, I would not make it again. Disappointed!

I made this yesterday to take on a picnic, and it was good. I liked how it was supposed to be served at room temperature so I didn't have to worry about keeping it very cold. Next time I would be tempted to just use regular kalamata olives rather than oil-cured ones.

Rating: 4
Blending the sun dried tomatoes with the olive oil, vinegar and garlic is key. It creates a well textured dressing that adheres beautifully to the pasta. I doubled the dressing and added artichoke hearts, toasted pine nuts, arugula and crushed red pepper to the mix. Was told it was the best pasta salad ever had!

Rating: 2
This is a good salad, but did not meet my expectations based on the reviews. I thought the dressing was too thick and tomatoey, and in the future I may double the other dressing ingredients and leave the sun dried tomatoes at 1/2 cup. I couldn't even taste the olives in the salad due to the strong tomato presence, and I love olives. So I'd try it again with less sun-dried tomatoes.

Rating: 3
This salad was delicious and fairly simple to make. I did substitute in 3Tbs of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and used Parmesan burgundy olives. I am not sure what size the servings are supposed to be. I had a dinner with 6 and left-overs for a week!

This is really tasty. I made it with whatever I had on hand, to go with grilled chicken. (Didn't have mozzarella; used fontina. Didn't have oil-cured olives; used kalamata.) Even with substitutions, it was excellent. Thanks to other reviewers for suggestions on the dressing -- those were right on.

Rating: 4
I think I have tried every pasta salad on this website and this is the best. The dressing is what makes it. I upped the dressing quantities by 50% based on other reviews and I'm glad I did. I also threw extra garlic in due to my compulsion to always add extra garlic. The last change I made was using dried basil - I added it right to the dressing. I used dried because it is March in Connecticut, not exactly prime basil season.

Rating: 3
Absolutely wonderful! Reduce the amount of olive oil you use and instead use an entire jar of sun- dried tomatoes with its oil. As others recommended double the oil combination - put half in when you make it and the other half just before you serve it. The pasta obsorbs the oil, doubling is a must. Put the basil in very last before you serve it to keep its fresh taste. Such a great recipe!

Had lots of great elements but it just didn't come together for me. Didn't particularly care for the dressing - it looked very unappetizing once the sun-dried tomatoes were minced up and the taste wasn't great either. Will re-work the dressing if I ever make it again.

This was one of the first recipes I ever made from this site...It was and still is and absolute household favorite. It's fairly simple to prepare and it makes you look like a real gourmet! I typically just use pitted Kalamata olives, but otherwise, I leave it alone. Don't mess with perfection.

I have made this pasta salad about 10 times now and it keeps tasting better & better -- I love the flavorful ingredients and today I made it w/out capers ( didn't have them on hand ) and it still came out just as yummy as before. I highly HIGHLY recommend this to anybody going to a 4th of July picnic/BBQ this weekend and wondering what you should bring ! Bring this salad ! Happy 4th to all.

Excellent! Even my picky husband liked it. Didn't have any red wine vinegar, so used 1/2 Balsamic and 1/2 Apple Cider Vinegar. Used extra capers in sauce. Green olives instead of black, because that's what I had...and Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan.

Made this today for Father's Day lunch, to accompany grilled salmon and asparagus. Lots of flavor. I followed the recommendation of several others, and made one and a half times the amount of dressing. In the end, I felt it was a bit more than needed. Next time I'll try making it with the original amount suggested in the recipe. Still, it was very good. I substituted a little balsamic for some of the red wine vinegar, which I think was a good complement. I also threw in some leftover grilled zucchini, onion and peppers in the end, and I think they added a lot.

I have been making this pasta salad for BBQ's and volleyball team dinners for years and everyone has always loved it. I love the fact that you can make the sauce ahead...I do ALWAYS make double the amount of dressing and then I use a little more than indicated and that keeps it from being dry. Trader Joe's has good prices on the capers and olives.

I agree--good but not that great compared to what I expected. For pasta salad, the ingredients were pretty pricey for a little above average dish. By the way, I used about 1 1/2 recipes of dressing, & that was about right.

Only good, not great. I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of using whole wheat pasta instead of white, and the results tasted good, but I excepted more from such a highly reviewed recipe. I took it to a friend's BBQ, and it got eaten, but not raved about. I think much depends on the quality of the red wine vinegar and Parmesan you use as they are the major flavors.

I made this pasta salad for a baby shower and it was a big success. I've made it a few times since because my boyfriend always asks for it. As some people have suggested I would increase the sauce. I also added extra basil. If you live near a Trader Joe's, they have all the ingredients for this recipe and a spicy marinated fresh mozzarella that is perfect for this recipe. The leftovers are also good hot!

I made this for the first time this past weekend. It was a hit with the crowd.

I will be making this again soon!

This is a GREAT recipe cold, warm or hot that I've made numerous times. I always add fresh string beans and use the best mozzarella I can find (that makes a difference). I substitute a couple of tbsps of oil from the sun dried tomato jar, which gives nice flavor, and I add 1/2 cup of black olive paste instead of chopped olives.

this has got to be one of the best pasta salad recipes known to humankind. I've been making it for months and eat it almost every day for lunch. I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and bought some marinated mozzarella at Trader Joe's - it's packed in olive oil, crushed red pepper, and some herbs, so I don't need to add any other seasoning to the final product except a little salt. It's never been dry for me, but I don't measure the dressing ingredients - I puree a 10 oz jar of sun-dried tomatoes, oil and all, along with the garlic, the vinegar, and enough olive oil to make it the consistency of thick salad dressing. I've had it with capers and without and it's fine either way. Perfect every time! It keeps well, too - but I always bring it up to room temp before serving - otherwise, the olive oil's a bit globby. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
I was not sure about the amount of parmesan cheese in this recipe, but apparently that is what everyone loved. Three non-pasta-salad-eaters told me they really liked this recipe and that the parmesan cheese really added the final touch because most people skimp on that in the salad. They went back for seconds and thirds so I consider this a success! I would definitely make this again.

I agree with some previous reviewers that the sauce was a little rich and over-powered the fresh mozz. I liked the concept of blending ingredients for a sauce and will reuse it again with different, lighter ingredients. This was better heated up the next day.

Made this at a recent house party, and literally EVERYONE asked about the recipe and wanted it! In fact, I was asked to make it again for a party tomorrow. Definitely a hit.

I made this for a potluck and everyone had seconds. I followed the recipe, mixing olive oil with oil from the tomatoes, and using balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. Since I started this the night before, I put the dressing on, but waited until an hour before serving to add the rest of the ingredients. However, even after a couple days in the fridge it was still quite good.

I made this recipe for a tennis match and it was very good. I reduced the oil as others mentioned, and used the oil from the tomatoes rather than olive oil.

I made this salad for a crowd, and it was very successful. I left out the garlic in the dressing due to the tastes of my diners, and it was still excellent, although I would include it next time.

This receipe has become one of my regular summer barbeque side dishes. It's a real crowd pleaser. I love it so much I usually make a double batch so my family can have the leftovers during the week. The only thing I would change is not add the red wine vinegar because it changes the color of the pasta. In it's place I use white wine vinegar. It won't make much difference in the taste. This is one of my all time favorites since I always get rave reviews from everyone.

I added some chopped sundried tomatoes and capers to the salad as I like the additional burst of flavours and the texture and with the tri colourd fusilli it was beautiful.

It was ok, but nothing spectacular. It definately needed a bit more dressing and much more garlic to amp up the flavor. The delicate flavor of the mozzarella was totally lost, so I'd definately suggest using a stronger cheese (maybe feta?). I'd only consider remaking it with some serious tweaking to the original recipe.

I can't believe the poo-pooers of this recipe! We had to adjust the flavor a bit to our liking (as you do any recipe), but it's definitely worth making again. We made it for a picnic and LOVED it. I'd use less vinegar, a squeeze of lemon, more mozzarella, cracked pepper and a bit of Kosher salt. If you live near a Trader Joe's, they have a mozzarella that's seasoned with herbs and crushed red peppers, making it a bit spicy, but DELICIOUS!

This is the best pasta salad I've ever had and is a summer standby for picnics and barbecues. It has so many great flavors. I, like a previous reviewer, use the oil from the sundried tomatoes to further boost the flavor of the dressing. I think it's just as good with regular mozzarella rather than fresh, because the mild flavor of fresh mozzarella does tend to get overpowered.

Rating: 4
LOVE this pasta salad. I have made it dozens of times partly because I like it and partly because my friends and family always beg me to bring it to gatherings. I generally add more of the first five ingredients than the recipe calls for (maybe why mine has never been dry). Like previous reviewers, I add the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes bottle (too tasty to waste) and free-hand top it off with olive oil until the ingredients can blend smoothly in my blender. Depending on the crowd, I sometimes add the olives into the blended sauce (some people, especially little tykes, are scared away by visible olives). Also, I add double the mozzerella because I love fresh mozzerella. I've never taken home leftovers.

Didn't really like this recipe very much. As suggested by others I increased the dressing and used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes. It still didn't help much.

Unlike most of the previous reviewers, I thought this dish was a mishmash of too many flavors! I'd make it again, but I'd double the dressing with half the vinegar (balsamic, not red wine), and use the oil from the tomatoes.

I'm an experienced cook, and even with substantial tweaking, this dish turned out bland and dry. A big problem is that there is way too much pasta for the amount of vinaigrette given in the recipe. Pasta salad should not be swimming in an oily sauce, but the amount of vinaigrette given in the recipe is completely inadequate for an entire BOX of fusilli pasta (which is 1 pound). I used very high quality ingredients, added more garlic, hot pepper flakes, and artichoke hearts, and increased the amount of olive oil and it was still turned out just okay. It wasn't awful, but I have been eating it for lunch for several days now and I'll be glad to finish it. I don't think I'll make this one again unless I cut the amount of pasta in half and greatly increase the amount of garlic and herbs to give the salad some punch.

I had to make a few substitutions - couldn't find pitted kalamata olives at 2 different groceries, so I used chopped green olives instead. Having read a previous reviewer's notes, I decided why waste all that yummy oil from the sun-dried tomaotes? There's way more than 6 tablespoons in there. I'm SO glad I did that! Lastly, I used dried basil - definitely will opt for fresh next time. Additionally, I added cubes of grilled chicken and made this a one-dish dinner. I've been invited to make this as often as I like. It's basically 2 steps: 1) whir up the sauce and 2) cook the pasta & chicken, so there's no excuse for not doing it again! Yummy!

I make this recipe on a regular basis and make a few changes when I am strapped for time and ingredients. Basically I am not a big fan of capers and when I do not have them on hand I just sub in a few kalamata olives into the pesto. I also just rehydrate dry sun-dried tomatoes and add a touch more olive oil. The whole dish is delicious served as a salad or a hot pasta dish. So many people have recently dismissed sun-dried tomatoes for one reason or another, but they always love this dish! I highly recommend it!

A few changes that I make are 2 cloves of garlic, a bit of anchovy paste, a pinch or so of dried red pepper flakes, a mix of the oil from the sundried tomatoes and regular olive oil and a mix of red wine and balsamic vinegars. To make prep a snap, I start my food processor, drop the garlic cloves in, then add the tomatoes, some oil and the other ingredients. I find that this makes the dressing very smooth and flavorful. Also, be sure to use very good mozzarella, cherry tomatoes halved, good parm in shavings and olives according to taste. Best served room temp and can be kept for a few days but may need additional oil added at each serving.

Really wonderful recipe and very simple to make. Use the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes for an extra tomato kick. I realized too late that I had brine-cured not oil-cured olives, and it tastes great anyway. I left out both cheeses, because it was for a picnic and would not be refrigerated and added canned artichoke hearts at the suggestion of another reviewer. Definite keeper.

Yummm-mmy--- this salad has great flavours and takes no time at all to make. In fact we have already made it a couple of times in the past few weeks for different houseguests and everyone has loved it.

This recipe is excellent. Others mentioned there was not enough dressing. I think the problem is too much pasta. I used penne not fusilli and maybe it weighs more but I used 3/4 of a pound and still had to double the recipe for dressing. I found it very thick with the dried tomatoes so I did not double them just the oil and vinegar part. Anyway with 3/4 of a pound of pasta I would say it serves 8-10 and we are big eaters. I tasted it prior to adding the parmesan and don't think it adds anything I agree with the other reviewer who said it was lost with the strong taste of the salad. Oh I also added lots of jumbo shrimp which was an excellent addition. This recipe will be one of my standbys now. Its very impressive!!

This salad was easy to make and extremely tasty. It had zing! I chopped up the sundried tomatoes so there was a piece in every bite. I couldn't find black olives in oil at my grocery store, so I settled for plain canned ones and it still tasted great. I cut grape tomatoes in half instead and left the parmesan on the side. Not sure what everyone else is talking about but I had enough dressing before adding the second set of ingredients and was plenty. I will definately make this recipe again and again.

I hate to go against popular opinion, but I didn't think this was anything great. The only sun-dried tomatioes I could find were packed with Italian spices; perhaps that caused some of the problems. I "one-and-a-halfed" the dressing based on prior reviews and it seemed like the right amount. But I think the salad would be better just using balsamic vinegar, olive oil and garlic as a dressing. I also felt that the Parmesan was lost in the salad.

Rating: 4
This was so yummy! I followed reviewers' suggestions (1 1/2 times dressing, balsamic)and let people add the parmesean to taste. Intense flavor of sun-dried dressing really sets this apart from the traditional summer tomato, basil, mozzarella pasta. I will make this many more times. Incidentally, unlike another reviewer, I did not find it made too much for 8, as a main course with salad and bread it was enough but not too much.

Made this to accompany Cowboy steaks. FANTASTIC! Like other reviewers, I'm tired of salads doused in mayo or oil. I did omitt the capers since I didn't have any on hand, and used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. I bet this would also be fantastic with roasted red peppers in the dressing instead of sundried tomatoes. Will definitely make this again:)

I'm typically not a pasta salad fan b/c most versions are either doused w/ a gallon of mayo or a bottle of Italian dressing. This version, however, is outstanding. The flavors are strong and flavorful, and the sun-dried tomatoes in the dressing really make the dish. Along w/ other reviewers, I substituted balsamic vinegar and smoked mozzarella, and I left out the olives. Fantastic. I served this for lunch along w/ the Tuscan chicken sandwiches on this website and baby spinach salad w/ balsamic vinegairette. Everyone loved it!

I really enjoy this salad. It is such a nice change from the usualy pasta salad, and so easy to make. I get requests for it all the time. I followed the suggestions of other readers and use basalmic vinegar and usually don't include the olives. The other night I made the dressing and put it over hot pasta with whatever I had on hand: basil, tomatoes, parmesian and chicken. It was a delicious meal.

Rating: 4
Awesome - as always the recommendations from other reviewers make all the difference. I doubled the dressing but only need half again. The extra dressing was excellent on baguette slices so it didn't go to waste. I have a friend who doesn't like capers but he loved this. I bought the kind of black olives the recipe called for and tasted them before adding them and decided not to add - they tasted like feet. This is great without them.

This was a great recipe. I made the "sauce" the night before, omitted the olives altogether (I can't stand them) and used Santa Claus tomatoes cut in half---all trying to save some time. It was great. Everyone ate it including my 3 and 1 year olds!! Definitely a hit.

It's so nice when you come across a great salad that I can throw together with ingredients that I always have on hand. The few changes that I made were using campagnelle instead of fusilli, 1/2c. each of parmesan and romano, 1/2c. of black olive tapenade for minced oil-cured black olives, and ommited the mozzarella. I enjoy fresh basil and didn't feel that it was excessive. I may be the only one who actually appreciated the less oily dressing. Because of the consistency and the shape of the pasta, it coated everything perfectly, and all of the great flavors came through. No pool of olive oil at the bottom of the bowl. Perfect for a light lunch with homemade focaccia and a chilled glass of chardonnay. A beautiful, colorful presentation. A definite winner.

Prepared all the ingredients in the morning (including the pasta - just sprayed lightly with olive oil to keep from sticking together) and tossed a few hours prior to dinner.

This pasta salad is wonderful, full of intense flavors - not at all boring or standard fare.

This recipe was delicious. However, I only used 4 finely torn basil leaves. One cup of basil would have been too overpowering. I also substituted Loccatelli cheese for the Parmesan.

In my family are true pasta salad aficionados, so I was afraid that this very different recipe might not be to their liking. I was wrong. They absolutely loved it!

This is a great recipe. I made it as written, except I did put in a couple of Tbsp of sundried tomato oil instead of olive oil, I used feta cheese vs mozzarella and I used grape tomatoes cut in half. I made it a day ahead and chilled all components separately. Since I was adding the dressing to chilled vs warm pasta, I warmed the dressing slightly in the microwave so it would mix in easily. About an hour before serving I stirred everything together, and chopped the basil and mixed it in. This was a great recipe for my first BBQ of the season. I recommend it.

I love this recipe! I've made it for picnics, parties, you name it, and everyone loves it! Like a previous reviewer, I have added chicken to it when I want it to be more substantial, but it's great on it's own. I also just use the oil the tomatoes come in to get more of the tomato flavor - the sauce should be just enough to stick to the pasta, not to be saucey.

Rating: 3
There was not enuf sauce so I would double that or decrease the pasta. The sauce did taste great. Thought it needed a little more salt but increasing the sauce ratio might help that. Also, the basil never seemed to meld with the rest of the salad and this may be cuz it was so dry or not cut small enuf. Despite these problems I thought it had potential cuz the sauce was really tasty.

I doubled the garlic and parmesan and halved the number of olives (we're not crazy about olives). The result was only so-so the night I made it...but two days later, the flavors had really had time to meld and when I brought it out for a dinner of leftovers, I got rave reviews. I almost think it would work better with a stronger cheese--the fresh mozarella didn't seem to add much.

I made this for a large family gathering. This dish went over very well and was something that I could make in advance. Couple of things that I did: When cooking the pasta, put about 2 tsp of salt into it. It sounds like alot, but it brings out the most incredible taste in (all) pasta. When making in advance, the pasta will absorb all the juices, which can leave it on the dry side. I added a little bit more olive oil and vinegar just to moisten it up a bit. Wonderufl dish for those hot summer days

I made this dish over the weekend and found it to be really good. I will make this again with some adjustments. I also found it to be a little too vinegar tasting so I will cut back a little bit and would like to add red onions to give it a kick. I made everything the night before and before serving added the basil. I did not have to double the sauce as some of the other reviewers did.

This was delicious. I took the advice of the reviewers and made additional sauce -- one and a half times the amount specified in the recipe and it was the perfect amount. I needed this dish to be a main dish at a shower, so I used the Tri-Color Tortellini from Costco, which was delicious. I also added sliced artichoke hearts, diced red onion and eliminated the Parmesan Cheese (there was enough cheese already). Per another reviewers suggestion, for the vinegar I used half red wine vinegar and half balsamic vinegar, that was a really nice touch (note: I will slightly cut back on the total amount of vinegar next time, it was just a bit too "vinegary".) I also made everything (except the basil and red onion) the night before so the flavors would develop and saturate the pasta and mozzarella cheese, then added the basil and red onion a few hours before. I will definitely make this again.

Ding Ding Ding! Just made this (according to recipe instructions, but left out the olives) and it looks, smells, and tastes great! I used ziti noodles and the sun (actually oven) dried tomatoes I made last week. To make your own dried tomatoes, slice fresh tomatoes (any kind) and put them cut side up on a baking sheet or dish. Sprinkle with a 1/2 and 1/2 mix of salt and sugar (just a little on each piece) and bake at 200 degrees for six hours (or overnight). Take off the sheet and put the dried tomatoes in a container/jar and sprinkle on a little olive oil. Refrigerate and use as needed (they keep a long time). Enjoy!

I am not a big fan of pasta salad, but this one is much better than most. I served it at a party, and there were no leftovers. I made it the night before, except for the basil, which I added just before serving. The amount of dressing called for in the recipe seemed just about perfect. Finally, I used minced oil-packed sun dried tomatoes, which saved a step, but more important, did an absolutely fantastic job of clinging to the spirals of the pasta. I bought them because they were the only kind available at the time in the store, but I am glad I discovered them and will use them in a lot of recipes involving sun dried tomatoes.

WOW! I'm not a big fan of pasta salads, my experience is that they are dry or so soaked in oil or strong vinegar its just terrible. Well, I've changed my mind. I made this recipe for my monthly summer luncheon and it had all my friends licking their chops! This recipe is so flavorful and yummy. I didn't quite double the dressing but I added a bit more than what was called for. Good call. Thanks for the advise from so many previous reviewers. I also decreased the parmesan cheese to 1/2-2/3 cup. I added a small jar of drained artichoke hearts and 1/2lb of shrimp. Got the basil from my garden and it was so fragrant. Loved the taste the salty capers gave the dish. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Will make it again and again. By the way, no leftovers were in sight. Even my 5 year old, Emma, loved if.

This is easy and really great with a few revisions. I would suggest twice the amount of sauce that the reccipe called for.

good flavor but much too dry. Try my version - it's fantastic if I do say so myself. For the dressing, use 3/4 c. sun-dried tomatoes and l (l5 oz. can) whole or chopped tomatoes, 3 or 4 fat cloves fresh garlic, 1/4 C. balsamic, 1/2 C. olive oil and 2 T. capers. Blend everything in the blender. To the salad add a good amount of finely chopped red onion, use feta instead of mozz, and add a couple handfuls of chopped fresh basil. Don't bother with the parmesan. There is ample dressing which takes care of the dry problem, but it still has the intense flavor of the sun-dried tomatoes. I also added cooked beans, cooked whole wheat berries, and toasted pumpkin seeds and pine nuts for a variety of textures. A little salt and lots of black pepper. awesome

I loved the fresh mozzarella, maybe because I made the salad the day before and it had absorbed lots of yummy dressing. I added the basil + adjusted seasoning just before serving. Also added some toasted pine nuts at the last minute and was very pleased with the result. Will add this to my permanent collection.

I LOVE this pasta salad!! Followed the recipe pretty much as is, but used 4 cloves of garlic and kalamata olives. The salad is a bit dry, but is the way I like it. There are few things worse to eat than goopy, drippy pasta salad swimming in oil. You can always freshen it up with a drizzle of olive oil if necessary. Really flavorful tomatoes are absolutely essential, as is lots of fresh basil. I will definately make this again.

I've made this dish on several occasions, and it's always a hit. I'm a big fan of the mozzarella, and agree with a previous reviewer that it is indeed supposed to absorb the flavor of the dressing.

Overall, this is a great pasta salad recipe...and definately a change from the same boring ones we see at every picnic all summer long. I think it would be better with extra sauce, maybe half again the what the recipe calls for? Otherwise we found it to be a bit dry. But the flavors are great and exciting. Try it, you won't regret it!

I made this dish (along with about a dozen others) for our July 4th party. With too many things going on at the same time, I forgot to add the tomatoes. I added a few extra kalamata olives that required, and also followed another reviewers comment and added Trader Joe's Sundried Tomato Pesto since it was already in the refrigerator. As for the missing tomatoes, it was the following day that I discovered them, and can honestly say that with all of the other flavors, they were not missed.

My husband loves this dish. The kids used the fusilli that I'd purchased for this dish, so we ended up with a combination of rotelle, elbow and mostaciolli (sp?) to make 1 lb. As a result, the noodles were a little dry after chilling, but am making again tonight with the right pasta.

Also, can easily double or triple for a party...a perfect summer side dish!

The thing about fresh mozzerella is, it isn't *supposed* to have a lot of flavor. It's *supposed* to be bland, and will suck up all the good flavors of the the dressing and the rest of the salad. I happen to love it in this dish, and wouldn't dream of leaving it out. This is a perfect summer dish.

I will agree with the previous 2 reviewers that the mozzarella added little to the dish. However, the other flavors in the dish are so delectable I forgot about the cheese. If anyone has a recommendation for a more flavorful cheese to substitute I would love to try it. This pasta salad gives a different spin to the old stand by and your guests will love it! Perfect for an adult summer gathering.

This was a delicious side-dish alternative. In my view, though, the mozzarella adds little. Its subtle flavor is overwhelmed by the intensity of the basil, olives and dressing. I would not include it next time.

This dish came out very nicely. Our potluck dinner companions (whom I've since referred to this recipe) were very complimentary. I added toasted pine nuts for flavor and texture and even a tablespoonful of Trader Joe's Sundried Tomato Pesto. Next time, I will add more fresh mozzarella as I felt the flavor of the quantity dictated got lost among all that pasta and tomatoes. Also, I'm a big fresh mozzarella fan. I would also recommend going nuts with the fresh basil if you love the taste, as I do.

Incredible! This is one of the best-tasting pasta salads I have ever had. I added some crumbled feta and whole capers for something extra. Got many rave reviews, so this recipe is a definite keeper. I'm making it again tonight!

I needed an appetizer dish for a pot luck with my female producer friends and this was a hit. Very easy to prepare and flavourful. I varied the ingredients by 2x more oil and vinegar & sundried tomatoes to the mix. Once blended I again added more oil and vinegar to thin the paste. Once the other incredients were added the flavours blended together beautifully. Would do again.

I made this dish, without the olives, for a barbecue and it went over very well. I had requests to make it again. I made it the night before to let the flavors blend, and had to add more dressing before serving.

Well every one loved it, ate it right up i doubled the recipe for 8 ppl, and its all gone. i didnt use olives, becuase not everyone likes them, but without them you need salt. Dressing isnt to thick once its mixed into the pasta, its so its sticks nicely to the pasta, and i cooled off the pasta first with cold water

I was really disappointed in this recipe. It had a lot of potential, but didn't come through. I cooled the pasta as others suggested. The processed sun dried tomatoes made the dressing to thick for my taste. My suggestion would be to chop them separately and add.I made it for a barbecue party and 3/4 of the the bowl was left over.

Very tasty, with very robust flavors, but I would reduce the amount of black olives next time.

This recipe is easy and a crowd-pleaser. If you like flavorful pasta salad that packs a punch, then this is for you. This recipe makes quite a bit, so doubling it results in a vat of pasta - FYI.

It was a huge hit at my last BBQ.

I learned that pasta should be cold when making a pasta salad, this way the pasta does not soak up all the dressing, instead the dressing lightly coats the pasta and won't be dry. Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Also, I didn't use a processor, because I like my capers whole. I whisked the dressing, cut up the sun dried tomatoes by hand and it was great. For those of you that have a Trader Joe's nearby, it's the perfect place for inexpensive sun-dried tomatoes, capers, etc. This is a great dish!!!

Whenever making pasta salads, the pasta should always be drained and then put in cold water and drained again, if you don't, you'll need double the amount of dressing.

We don't like olives so we didn't use them, really quick and easy to make and very delicious. We will definitely make this one again.

Good, not fantistic, but has potential. I softened the garlic a bit beforehand (as recommended by others) so the raw garlic wasn't overwhelming. Also, when eating leftovers the next day, I warmed it in the microwave to warmer than room temperature, and that enhanced the flavor greatly.

Rating: 3
I made the salad the night before serving. Since the warm pasta absorbs liquid, next time I won't drain the sun-dried tomatos. Also I'll add sliced mushrooms and a bit more garlic.

After making the following modifications, I was extremely happy with this recipe. I used four cloves of garlic, no sun dried tomatoes, no basil and about half of the parmesan called for. I also used kalamata olives. Though garlicy, the flavors balanced well and the garlic will mellow when the salad is refrigerated.

Rating: 3
This dish was wonderful. The dressing was thick and full of flavor. Not only did it taste great, but it looked great as well. I didn't read the reviews before I made it so I didn't use the extra garlic but I probably will next time. Also, I used brine-cure kalamata olives instead and they added the extra salt that I was looking for.

I made this for a pitch-in lunch at work, and everyone raved about it--not only about its unique, tasty blend of flavors, but also about how beautiful it looked. I omitted the olives and capers and used 2 cloves of garlic. Also, I bought sun-dried tomatoes that were not packed in oil (to save money)...and then I just let them soak in the 6 T. of oil for a little while before mixing up the dressing in a blender.

This recipe is great! Thanks to previous reviewers' comments, I added 4 cloves garlic - it was perfect. I took this dish to a southern "BBQ" dinner party and it was a huge hit! (Plus it makes a huge amount). I added this recipe to my card file to make again and again.

I thought this was a great recipe. I made only minor changes using kalmata olives, garlic rice vinegar and grape tomatoes. I read the reviews after I made it and think I will try a mix of feta and mozz next time. Yum!

Made this today to serve for a salad dinner. I was doubtful about all the strong flavors however when all together and left to season in the fridge, it turned out delicious. Made half the recipe exactly as stated and have enough left over for lunch tomorrow. The cheese, fresh tomatoes and basil just seem to mellow all the other tastes. My husband and I really enjoyed it with a green salad with fresh red peppers and cukes. Also served a white bean salad. It was a yummy summer dinner.

I continue to be amazed at the favorable reviews for this recipe. I made it again last night, exactly as written, except I used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 balsamic. Know what? It was even worse than before. The dressing comes out thick, and tasting of nothing but bitter, sun-dried tomatoes. The large amount of parmesean cheese doesn't help the thick, pastey consistence at all. These two tastes overwhelm everything else in the dish. Ten dollars of fresh mozerella was wasted. Next time, do yourself a favor: 1) Leave out the sun-dried tomatoes and the parmesean cheese. 2) Then simply, lightly whisk together the dressing ingredients. I am convinced, if you are using good cheese and good tomatoes, that this will produce an infinitely better final product.

The biggest compliment during the bbq was hearing how good this salad was when the "complimenters" didn't know I made it. I used cherry tomatoes, 1/2 basalmic vinegar, kalamata olives and fresh mozzarella (as instructed). Very easy and very yummy. This is a keeper. Remember- 3 forks = delicious.

This pasta dish sounds better than it actually is. I thought it was too bland and had to add a lot more garlic AND red wine vinegar AND basil to even taste it. It was a lot of chopping and slicing for me. It is good, but not great. I'm still looking for that WOW recipe.

This is a reshreshing summer picnic salad. I've substituted fresh tomatoes for the sun-dried tomatoes (had a glut in the garden, so I thought I'd try it) and it had a VERY fresh taste! Also, I've used a variety of pastas as experiments and actually found that the corkscrew spinach pasta was one of the best variations.

This a good pasta salad recipe, though I'm still looking for one that is something I just can't live without. - I've made this recipe several times, both as it is written and with some modifications. Family and friends always rave and ask for the recipe so maybe I'm just difficult to impress, I don't know. Still, I suggest using gemelli pasta, which tends to hold up better than fusilli which can tend to break up. Also, in addition to the fresh mozzarella, add some crumbled ricotta salata, which plays off the the flavors of the olives and capers nicely. Lastly, don't skimp on the sauce ingredients, as this pasta salad is not an overly moist one.

This is the second time I have made this pasta salad. My guests loved it the first time. I wasn't totally sold on it so I made some further adjustments from the first time. This time I loved it as well. I know its not really the same making changes to the original but so many of us do it. I did omit the capers and olives both times. I am not an olive person. I listened to some previous reviewers and added some balsamic vinegar. It needed a little more flavor and this was the key. I would suggest to cut the red wine vinegar in half and add the balance in balsamic. I have used two different food processors and I was unable to get the sun-dried tomatoes coarsely chopped. I think the finer consistency actually added flavor to the dressing. I normally find pasta salads to be dry and then become even drier. I normally increase the dressing by another half or sometimes double if I am making it in advance. I will reserve some to pour over right before serving to moisten it up a bit. I also used grape tomatoes which I halved. I think using them or cherry tomatoes makes a nice presentation and they are nice bite size pieces.

I made this for a pot-luck barbecue, and it was a huge hit! I made the first half (dressing and pasta) the night before, then pulled it out of the fridge and added the mozzarella, olives, cherry tomatoes, basil, etc., about three hours before the party and keep room temp. My little twists: definitely plenty of FRESH mozzarella (try the little boccancini cut in half or quartered), plenty of tiny cherry tomatoes cut in half, toasted pine nuts, 50% more garlic, and DEFINITELY the correct oil-cured olives. I suspect those who thought this recipe bland used plain black olives. Also: I used pasta shells instead of the recomended fusilli, and wished I hadn't. Shells stack themselves up and are harder to mix into the dressing, etc...

I made this as written, except used oil-packed feta with herbs in place of the mozzarella (I had it in the fridge). With the dressing and using kalamata olives, it was perfect. My kids even loved it.

True to form, I did not follow this recipe to the letter--it's my policy not to do so. Since I was making it for a Yugoslavian friend who has lived in Greece, I used feta cheese and used kalamata olives instead. I also left the dressing quite chunky to give it some added texture. It was wonderful! He can't wait until I am feeling domestic enough to make it again.

I am eating this salad right now, it's as yummy now as it was for dinner last night. This is a tasty simple dish to prepare. One word of advice, be sure to use the best fresh mozzerella you can find. I had to shop at the not-so-gourmet grocery store for these ingredients and I was unhappy with their mozzerella. Also, I had thought about leaving out the fresh tomatoes, but they add a nice crunch to the salad. Next time I'll try yellow teardrop tomotoes instead of Romas.
