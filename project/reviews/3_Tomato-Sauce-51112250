Delicious! The only change I made was to make mine from scratch with tomatoes from my garden. We grow the mortgage lifters, very meaty and yum! I make this in large batches and then can it but it takes two days of peeling, seeding and simmering to get it purrrffect. Thank you for the base as my mother's added sugar that mine just didn't need!
