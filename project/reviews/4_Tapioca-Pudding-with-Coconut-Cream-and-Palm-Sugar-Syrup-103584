Very easy to make. I used a vanilla bean and brown sugar, which made a lovely syrup. The dish is overall very light and refreshing, with just the right amount of sweetness. The coconut cream is good when mixed with other flavours but a little goes a long way - I had to be quite sparing. I might try it with a nut cream next time, or with fruit as suggested by others. A very grown-up dessert, probably not to childrens' taste.

This is totally delicious. I used the giant tapioca pearls; just double the cooking and sitting time.

I have made this several times for asian-inspired dinner parties. I serve it with brown sugar ginger ice cream, and eveyone including my very particular husban loves it.

Admittedly, this dish has been built up in my mind way too much during the year that I casually looked for pandan leaves. I liked it, but didn't love it. The pandan has a great flavor and I am sure I will use it again in other dishes. After a few bites, however, I was bored by it. I think I would have liked it much more had I cut up fresh fruit as was suggested by previous reviewers.

The combination of flavors of the coconut milk with the pandan leaf/palm sugar syrup was very good. Next time I make this, I'll double the amount of syrup, and make it into 8 servings. I will also lightly salt the water that I cook the tapioca in. I think I'll also make a sizable batch of the syrup to put on pancakes, waffles, and ice cream!

I rinsed the Tapioca an additional time as it still seemed starchy. The result was wonderful. The coconut and pandan flavors are a great combination. A perfect light dessert.

My tapioca came out gooey and the dark brown sugar has too much of a taste. I guess I will have to try again!

We served the tapioca, topped it with a mix of chopped pineapple and mango, then drizzled the syrup over it. Topped it with a dollop of coconut cream straight from the can. It was sublime.

Yummy! I added blueberries, papaya, and banana and substituted a vanilla bean for the pandan leaf as suggested by other reviewers.

This is a very Southeast Asian desert. We love it, I make this often, If you can not find pandan leaf you can use vanilla bean. It is really good served with fruit also, like mango chunks or banana, that would be very traditional in Indonesia. Also great as a light refreshing summer treat served over the top of shaved ice. We buy this from street carts all over Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia when we visit

The dessert was wonderful! No one left a morsel in their dish. I could not find pandan leaf in a market near me, but I did find pandan extract. I used a 1/2 teaspoon in place of the pandan leaf in the syrup and it added a very unique and complex flavor. Also, we added ripe rasberries and black-berries to the dish after reading Troy, NY's review and the addition of these berries was a good choice. The rasberries and the black-berries mirrored the shape of the tapioca pearls which made the dish that much more inviting to the eye and palate.

Delicious, specially for something so quick and foolproof. I mixed in some blueberries which added a nice balance to the flavor.

Very good light dessert. I was unable to find a pandan leaf but did find pandan liquid. The liquid gave the dish a beautiful light green color and a vanilla like flavor I have made it without and is still quite good.
