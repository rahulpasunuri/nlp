Followed recipe to a tee, but found it bland and not very appealing looking. I love steak salad, but slicing the meat first and cooking it in all that oil makes a big grey pile of meat without any browning or char on it. Next time I would cook it whole, then slice - and marinate it beforehand to give it more flavor; the taste of the rosemary and garlic didn't come through at all. I had to add more red vinegar to spike it up, as the dressing was mostly oily meat juice and fat. Also added shaved parmesan, which improved it a lot. It needs more flavor!

This is quite good. A few adjustments (sorry). More greens, split 1 filet mignon for two people, and more dressing. Threw in zucchinni strips to boost the veggies. Sprinkled blue cheese on top. Yum.

Sheer genius! I made this tonight with left over thinly sliced prime rib roast beef. For such a simple recipe the results are remarkable. I cooked as written and it served my husband and myself nicely. An excellent left overs recipe!

Very yummy, inexpensive. Arugula tastes great with the steak and the dressing is really tasty. Good times.

We loved this recipe. I did add extra vinegar, shallots and grape tomatoes as recommended and reduced a little more. this is excellent and easy. My husband who isn't a salad lover said he would have this in a heart beat.

As other reviewers have said, this recipe will go in my weekly dinner cycle. It's so easy, fast, and savory. I have followed the recipe verbatim and my husband and I both love it, but I would recommending increasing the oil/dressing amounts if you are pouring the dressing directly on top of a large helping of greens, or tossing first with the arugula before adding on the sliced steak. I also added extra shallots and garlic. With the richness of the meat juices/oils/vinegars I wouldn't add any cheese, but I love the idea of adding cherry tomatoes and will try this next time.

OK, I made a mistake in actually rating this when i didn't even cook it. I just used it as inspiration for putting a steak salad together. I also added cherry tomatoes as another reviewer suggested. I didn't cook anything. Had leftover steak from lunch, piled it on in strips and drizzled in walnut oil & the vinegars. It was OK but nothing wow. PS: I can't undo the fork rating so I gave it a 2. Half way.

I like this recipe's ease and tastiness so much that I've been making it once a week since I discovered it. I like to serve it with baked sweet potato fries.

Rating: 3
Very good, however I think I needed to reduce the dressing a little more. My arugula ended up a little soupy which was not appetizing at the end. Otherwise the flavors were awesome and the whole recipe was straightforward and simple. I also added some cherry tomatoes to the dressing. Good call.

This is going to become one of my new go-to dishes for a quick, last-minute dinner. It's so simple but so delicious. If this is really trattoria food, then I wish I was named Luigi.

Delicious! Made recipe exactly as written, but didn't have a shallot so I substituted white onion and it was still delectable. Only mistake was only making 1/2 the recipe since there were only two of us, but it was so good, will never make that mistake again. This will definitely go into the dinner recipe rotation.

Delicious and so simple and easy to prepare. Have received rave reviews and lots of "yummy" sounds from people eating this. Impressive.

"geoffrey2k from San Francisco, CA" made it sound as if he seared the meat THEN cut it. I've seen other recipes that call for that method such as 'Seared Beef Tenderloin with Thyme' which I prefer honestly but to be fair I did not make this recipe exactly as indicated because it seemed strange to me use the fatty oil the meat was in as a dressing, I know it's just the juice from the steak but it looked rather unappetizing.

Outstanding! Make it precisely as written, or add halved cherry tomatoes to the shallot/vinegar mix at the end to add an extra bit of sweetness. A superb recipe.

Very good and ridiculously simple. We followed the recipe verbatim, save for the steak - we used a ribeye, which was very tender and tasty. It was so good we only got two servings out of it.

Simple, classic, delicious. Ive made this so many times now I've lost track. Along the way, Ive tried some mods to see how things turn out. If you dont have fresh rosemary, you can use the dried, but just be careful not to overcook it, and definitely remove it before cooking the meat, or whatever you leave will be burnt. For the garlic, I typically do sliced rather than smashed, and up the quantity a bit to get some more flavor extraction. Golden is correct. Dont brown the garlic or you'll get the wrong flavor. One thing Ive definitely found is a good change. Dont preslic the steak. You can actually do this recipe in a grill pan. The ridges will keep the oil below the steak and to the outside of the pan, which allows you to get a nice peppered crust on the steak. Dont use frozen steaks. You can go all the way down the scale to tri-tip and as long as it is fresh, and you cook it very hot and quickly, it will turn out great. Blackened nearly on the outside, and rare on the inside. While the meat is out of the pan and resting (before you slice it) you can toss in the shallots and vinegars. This part is also important. 2 minutes is a very quick cook for the shallots, and I'd suggest a good deal longer to get that nice caramelized flavor, as well as reducing the vinegar enough so that you dont need to add sugar. Enjoy!

delicious and impressive enough for a light company meal. I prepped the oil ahead of time and the house smelled sooo good when my guests arrived. The only modification I made was to add extra balsamic vinegar and a pinch of sugar to the dressing as it was reducing down. I served the wild mushroom bread puddings which I had made in muffin tins on the side and got rave reviews!

If I was rating this on taste AND ease of preparation, it would be a 4-forker. Really easy to make and the end result was yummy. I would not substitute spinach for arugula - the nutty bitterness of the arugula made it! I served it with roasted curried cauliflower and sweet potato chunks.

Heat the oil in advance, serve your appetizer, then prepare your main course in less than 10 minutes! Delightful and delicious, it always works.

Delightful and delicious, it always works. Prepare the oil in advance, and when you make the dish (after serving an appetizer), it takes less than 10 minutes. A real find.

Just had this at a dinner party and loved it. Make sure to let balsamic vinegar cook long enough w/ shallots to become sweet and syrup-like. Garnish with grated cheese (we had parm, but a few shavings of good blue would be amazing as well). Make this for a group as it's easy and delicious!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. There were so many rave reviews that I thought it would be really good. I would do a few things differently if I decide to make it again-- first-- it is really important to serve this RIGHT AWAY-- not 10-15 minutes after you've added the dressing or the arugula quickly becomes soggy and the whole dish is very watery. Also this dish looses points on presentation-- it is difficult to make a tower of meat look attractive, no matter how good the cut.

Absolutely superb! But next time I'll try adding a little cheese (probably feta).

I love this recipe and have made it countless times. Do not change anything (except you can add more garlic if you'd like), and I often cook up the shallots with the steak. It is perfect and everyone will love you for making it.

The flavors were interesting, but it was incredibly oily.

Both my husband and I love this as is. It makes a terrific light meal in warmer weather, especially. However, now that it is Winter, I thought I would try it as a steak sandwich. I didn't have arugula, so used a sauteed yellow pepper. I used a baguette (brushed with olive oil, toasted under the broiler, then rubbed with garlic), piled on the steak and sauce, then topped with the yellow peppers. It was great!

Great for a quick summer supper. I like the idea of serving with french fries from another reviewer!

This is an "Oh my God" dish. I cheated with dried rosemary that I crushed and placed in a small bouquet garni pouch. Also used baby spinach by mistake once with serendipitous results. I serve it with store-bought frozen "gourmet rosemary olive oil french fries" that taste like homemade, which perfectly complement this insanely easy dish. Even friends/family who "can't cook" have taken to making this dish at home. Bravo!

I've made this many times now and really love it. I like to substiute spinach and onions for the arugula and shallot. I'm a big fan of garlic so I use more and chop it up and leave it in the dressing. Fast, easy, delicious.

This was a cinch to make and awesome to eat :) hubby loved it too. I made it exactly as written, however only had about half the required arugula so subbed in a spring mix for the other half. Really good!

Loved this recipe, especially the dressing/sauce, but it doesn't seem to make enough of it. Has anyone tried increasing the amounts? Doubling it is too oily. I would like to make it for a group, but would need more of the dressing.

Very good. The only improvement in terms of prep would be to freeze the meat for 20-30, slice it, and bag it for use later that day. I like to sear the meat when it's close to room temp to get true medium-rare. But the recipe itself is great, and the spicy arugula is an excellent complement to the rich beef and oily, shallot sauce.

So quick and delicious! The flavors are balanced just perfectly. Be careful not to overcook the beef since they cook through so quickly. Yum yum.

Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner! Husband, daughters loved it too. Next time I will infuse the oil w/the garlic & Rosemary a little earlier to give more time for the flavors to marry into the oil/dressing. I will also throw some rosemary in with the meat when I slice it the morning of (in a ziploc). I love this for my low carb diet weeks!! Don't forget to season the arugula with a little salt too!

Rating: 4
This was really outstanding and easy. I left out the shallots since they don't agree with me or my husband, and it was still outstanding. Hint: if you have trouble slicing the meat thinly, put it in the freezer for 20-30 minutes. This will make it much easier to slice.

Outstanding! Simple, quick and gourmet. I couldn't find arugula so I used baby spinach - great substitute. I also sauteed some oyster, portobello and button mushrooms with a splash of olive oil, thecrushed garlic and rosemary sprigs. Set aside, then followed the recipe. Topped the spinach with steak and shrooms, drizzled dressing, and finished it off with steamed baby asparagus. Served with warm bruschetta and a glass of Syrah. A dish to impress!

We loved this simple dish -- the flavor was exceptional. However, I thought there was too much olive oil in the dressing. Either that, or the vinegars didn't incorporate well with the oil. Next time I'll ensure the oil is really hot (never mind the spattering) and see if it improves.

Very quick, easy and delicious recipe. I threw in some plum tomato wedges and parmesan shavings for color. The dressing is what makes the dish, so use good vinegars.

loved, loved this recipe...easy and wonderful with some crusty french bread and a glass of zinfandel. It came together quickly and looked beautiful. I used baby spinach instead of arugula since I had some. Thought there may not be enough dressing but it was perfect. The aroma of garlic and fresh rosemary was intoxicating.

This is a delicious dinner and super easy and fast to make. I can't wait to make it again. That's how good it is. I used spinach instead of arugula and both my husband and I ate every last bite. I served it with some garlic and herb rice and dinner was done. It is definitely worth a try!

I haven't tried this one yet, but I can tell it is a winner! I had something very similar in Italy over the summer. Paper thin cold roast beef slices layered on a plate with arugula on top dressed with olive oil and thin shavings of parmesian (or other hard Italian cheese). I will have to try this one at home for sure!

This is just one in the endless count of tasty, hearty, simple and amazing Roman dishes. I also recommand it with tangy dandilions or baby spinach, which are tipical of Rome area too, like arugola. However you like it, keep it simple, and don't bring any American steak sauces to the table with this! Buon Appetito! A Roman girl in America.

This was so good! I made it with rosemary mashed potatoes on the side to make it a complete meal. I will definately make again.
