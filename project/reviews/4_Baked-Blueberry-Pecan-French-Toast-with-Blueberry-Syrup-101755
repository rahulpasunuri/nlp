I was looking for a baked french toast recipe and this sounded delicious. It was a bit of effort and came out too soggy and with not much taste considering the yummy ingredients. I cooked it longer than the recipe calls for based on other reviews, but still didn't really help the consistency. The kids in the house wouldn't eat it. Overall, a big disappointment and would not recommend it.

I have been making this recipe for several years now and we love it exactly as written (although it does take longer to cook - even after bringing to room temp) But for the holidays I alter it by skipping the nuts and berries and swapping 1/2 the milk for eggnog - it's just perfect!

For the past 10 years, I have made this dish on Christmas morning. The only thing I do differently is omit the syrup - it's not necessary.

Rating: 4
Per other reviews, I cut the sugar in half, I let the dish rest at room temp for an hour before baking, and I baked it for 30 minutes. This dish was outstanding!! It is so special that I am compelled to save it for Christmas morning only. The syrup is indeed the crowning glory. It is off-the-chart wonderful.

I LOVE this recipe - great for crowds - To cut on the sweetness and add some delish flavor I have added orange zest to the egg mixture - yumyum!

Love this recipe. I've made it for many many brunch gatherings. That said, it does require a bit of finessing IMHO. My modifications: - Bail in the pecans. I did them once and didn't think that it was all that great. I may one day try crumbled bacon. - Cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. 1 whole cup is way to much. - Syrup is nice (I've made it) but not necessary. Plain maple seems to work as well. - Take out of fridge at least an hour before putting in oven, or plan for much longer oven time. Very important - flip the bread over during the soaking/in the morning. That way its all soaked through on both sides.

Can't rave about a recipe where the liquid amount is too high and the cooking time way too low. very disappointing.

Terrific! A real crowd pleaser. As another reviewer suggested, I turned the bread a couple times to get all the liquid absorbed. The blueberry syrup is awesome and the leftover blueberry did not go in the trash but on some warm toast with butter!

I made the blueberry syrup to add to vanilla ice cream, and it is fabulous. I would LOVE to try it on the french toast as well. In fact I'd rather taste this than sugar, and would recommend cutting the sugar in the toast way back and use the syrup without reservation! Decadent.

What a perfect make ahead dish ! This baked dish is one we prepare often for our family and company. I do suggest turning the bread over, after a few hours, to absorb all of the liquid. Our friends request I make it and pass the recipe along! It is beautiful and appreciated by both sophisticated palates & kids.

I have made this several times always to rave reviews. Please don't skip the blueberry syrup, it is the crowning glory of this dish. I also didn't like it so sweet so reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I had to bake it an hour when I used the 3 cups of milk, and it was too soggy still for the kids, so I reduce to 2.5 cups of milk now. Enjoy!!!

Out of this world delicious! I went to the store late, didn't find a thin french baguette but a thicker one which worked out great. I cut pretty think pieces to avoid the mushiness others complained about. I sauteed the pecan on the stove (because I tend to forget them in the oven) and use that same pan to melt the butter sugar mixture. I loved that it was pretty much ready when I woke up because our guests were arriving pretty early. It cooked for abotu 35 minutes and puffed up beautifully. Like everyone says no need for the syrup. I had some leftover blueberries that we sprinkled on the cooked ones. Heavenly

I too have been making this for years. It is an excellent dish. I don't bother with the syrup - maple syrup is OK if someone wants it, but even without it, it's a treat. I usually bake it for 40 min at 380F which gives me the best result. Cooking time in the recipe is not right in any case.

I've been making this recipe for years. It's a favorite both at home when company is coming as well as football tailgates on chilly fall mornings. I've since begun to substitute challah for the baguette, which makes this all the more decadent. I do love how it allows you to spend time with your guests and not in the kitchen with its night-before prep. I still get oohs and ahs when it is served.

For the past 7 years, this has been a Christmas morning staple for our family. If you like traditional griddle-style french toast, you will probably not enjoy this. I would liken this dish to bread pudding. It is extremely soft and mushy. Even in my convection oven, I have to cook it for 30 - 35 minutes. Additionally, I never use the syrup - as it is sweet enough without it. I typically serve this with apple- chicken sausage, yogurt with homemade granola and fresh berries, and mimosas. Dee-lish!

I made this for my husband on Valentines Day, and it did not turn out as I had hoped. I used 2 ½ c. milk, which was still too much. The bread did not absorb all of the liquid and resulted in a mushy, runny consistency. The flavor was great, but the dish did not set up correctly. You definitely dont need to make the syrup with this. Assuming you already have the brown sugar and nutmeg, the dish costs approx. $16 to make. I ended up throwing the leftovers down the disposal&very sad since I hate wasting food. I do NOT recommend this dish, as there are plenty of others that will not disappoint.

Just made this for visiting friends. It was fabulous. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup in the egg mixture and used skim (non-fat) milk. I baked it 35 minutes and it puffed up beautifully. Wonderful blueberry /pecan topping. Half used syrup, half did not feel it was needed. Will become a staple especially at the cottage.

I have made this many times and have given the recipe to so many. It is a B&B quality breakfast to serve to guests and always pleases. If you're looking for traditional french toast, then this is not for you, but if you want something more elegant, this is perfect. Make sure your baguette is not doughy; buy a day in advance. Cook for 30 - 35 minutes and don't bother with any syrup!

I loved this recipe and so did everyone in my office. I doubled the recipe and did lessen the milk. I even added some stale cinnamon bagels because I ran a bit short on the sourdough bagette and it was delicious. Made the blueberry syrup which was good but really didn't need it.

I made this exactly as written. It was very good, but too gooey. I did cook an extra 15 minutes- --as others suggested--and that helped somewhat.

Well, I messed up and forgot to prepare this the night before, but it still came out fabulously and I thought I'd share in case anyone else finds themself in the same predicament. I also weighed my bread - seems to me part of the reason for the differing degrees of sogginess is at least in part to blame for their rather vague description of how much bread to use. Anyway, I used 10.25 ounces of bread, cut into about 18 pieces about 1 inch thick. Since I did not have very long to soak the bread, I cut the milk back to 2 cups. I let the bread soak for 3 hours, then I turned the bread over (to help speed the soaking process) and let it sit out and come to room temperature (cold pyrex in hot oven=big mess). I also cut back on one dirty dish by roasting the pecans on my stovetop - I added the butter and salt after about 5 minutes of roasting and stirred until the butter was melted. This turned out wonderfully. Nice and rich without being too rich - I think whole milk is essential for added flavor and richness. I baked it at 400 for about 25 minutes.It was not soggy at all - just perfect. We also skipped the syrup - you don't really need any, but I drizzle of plain maple syrup is very nice. So, if you forget to prepare it the night before, you can still have it easily ready in time for a late brunch.

I have made this several times for brunches and baby showers as written to rave reviews. I love it because it is a make-ahead show-stopper which makes the day of the party much easier.

After reading many of the reviews and trying a test batch, I found a system for this recipe that worked very well for me. I used a very crusty, good & stale French country baguette (needed closer to 1 1/2 baguettes because these are very skinny), chilled the bread in the milk for about 18 hours until almost all milk was absorbed, and baked at 400 for a good 35 minutes, until the center was noticeably puffed up and some blueberry juice was bubbling. The texture of the bread was soft but not at all milky, and the blueberries and pecans added texture and crunch. The syrup rounded it out nicely. I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this over and over again and my whole family loves it. The older the baguette the better - to soak in all the fluid. The brown sugar and toasted pecans add depth and crunch.

Very tasty, but as others have said, do not be afraid to bake it for a long time!. probably an extra 15 to 20 minutes, I took it out after 30 minutes, and it was still like bread pudding, but I was afraid the blueberries were going to burn; dont worry. I put it back in the oven, and it was better. If trying again, would keeping the heat at 350, and baking for 45 minutes to bake the insides, but not burn it work better? I will try next time.

Rating: 4
Easy! I've made another version with cream cheese, syrup, etc and this recipe is far easier and tastier. I cooked it for about 15 minutes longer, until the top had browned and the liquid was bubbling madly. Skipped the syrup as it was sweet enough as is and didn't do the nuts either. Still delicious.

Rating: 3
This takes about twice as much baking time as called for in the recipe, but I still like it. I've been making it on and off for years and it's always a big hit. It's quite sweet, and the texture is more like a souffle than french toast if you follow the proportions as they're written. I often use defrosted mixed berries instead of just blueberries, and don't always bother with the nuts... It depends on who my crowd will be. It's a great comfort food!

I made this for brunch and my guests devoured the entire dish. I pretty much followed the recipe. I did, hoewever, bake it for 35 minutes. I would suggest to keep checking it until the center is done. You can tell when it's done because it puffs up. I used a crusty french baguette from a local bakery and let it soak over night. Mine didn't turn out that sweet so the syrup drizzled on top was perfect. I will definitely make this again and so will my friends...they all took a copy of the recipes :)

I have made this several times because it's easy and delicious, and because it can all be assembled the night before. For those who have had a problem with it being soupy, there are 3 remedies. First, reduce the milk to 2 1/4-2 1/2 cups. Second, use more bread. (Unfortun- ately, the recipe doesn't give the weight of the bread.) Third, after baking, let sit a few minutes before serving. This recipe does not need the blueberry syrup, or any for that matter.

I was really disappointed with this dish after reading all the great reviews. I thought that the flavors were pretty good, but that it was sooo soggy. I should have know that this would be the case with soaking overnight, maybe I just expected something different. I however, won't make it again.

i have made this recipe twice and both times people asked (demanded!) to have copies of it. I made some modifications to make it a little lighter -- i used 1% milk and only 2 cups, plus I cut the sugar in half. I baked it at 350 for about 30-40 min. I do find that the butter/sugar you add at the end is important -- makes those pecans so amazing. I have never made it with the syrup and it definitely doesn't need it. I put maple syrup out when I served it and noone used it, so I think syrup is totally unnecessary. The second time I made it I used frozen cherries and replaced the vanilla with a tiny bit of almond extract -- it is amazing both ways!

I made this recipe for my family for Christmas morning this year, and it was truly scrumptious. A few comments: When I read the recipe I was sure the amount of brown sugar and maple syrup would yield a too-sweet result, but I followed it anyway, and was surprised to find it to be just right. I have practically no sweet tooth, so this meant a lot to me. Also, I only had chopped pecans, and they worked out perfectly well. It re-heated very well, with no discernible loss of moisture or flavor by putting it in a pan covered with foil and heating in a 300 degree oven. This is one of those recipes that work out perfectly for holiday mornings, as it can all be made the night before.

This turned out great but I changed the recipe. I thought the original sounded way too sweet. I added 1 cup of blueberries and one chunked apple onto the baguette slices. Left out the butter and cut the brown sugar back to 2-3 tbsp. Served with regular maple syrup. Kids and adults loved it, have promised to make it again.

Fantastic recipe One of my top 10 I make it for company and they always love it. I make extra sauce. I use various kinds of bread and cut them thick. Cinnamon bread, hawaiian bread, french bread . I add a little extra cinnamon. I make it the morning I am serving it, or I too had problems with it being too soggy. I soak it a few min while I'm toasting the almonds and making the sauce and it's ready to bake and comes out the same time as the baked eggs (which I add to the oven later) are done. One of the best ever.

Can't understand why other cooks report it came soggy,unless the oven temp.was off.It was delicious.Halved the recipe for only three people,and used a glass pie dish.The pecans,as well as the syrup,can be prepared the night before.Personally,I don't think the syrup was needed,but it's very good,so I'll save it for pancakes,etc.Also made it w/out the butter-brown sugar topping,using a dense whole grain bread, and served it w/the syrup.Still delicious.

Fairly good but also very sweet- too much so for most of the people at my brunch where I served it. The syrup is definitely not needed. I cut back the liquid to about 2 cups and it seemed ok. Adding the extra butter on top made the dish too rich I thought- i think you could easily cut the butter and brown sugar in half (it would take a lot for me to say that because i love sweet stuff! but trust me, this dish is too syrupy/rich for breakfast).

Rating: 3
Even though I read the reviews before making this recipe, I forgot to cut back on the liquid and my end result was soggy :( Nonetheless, the flavor was delicious and it was a hit with my in-laws. One other comment: I was too lazy to grate the fresh nutmeg and used ground instead but didn't cut back on the amount. The result was a bit too strong of nutmeg. Otherwise, an easy and beautifully presented breakfast dish for company. I served it with turkey sausages and fruit salad.

We love this dish and it is a football morning favorite. I find we don't need the syrup. And we have really liked it with semolina baguette. The cooking time seems to depend on the kind of bread and how soggy the bread is in the morning (the soggier the bread, the longer the cooking time).

I've been making this dish for two years and it is wonderful. The syrup is divine and well worth making. To solve the problem of the custard not setting or having an eggy center I only use 2-1/2 cups of milk and it turns out for me every time. I use a glass pyrex baking dish as it helps to tell if it is done or not.

This is now a staple breakfast in our house and everyone wants the recipe. The only issue I had is the cooking time as listed in other reviews. I had to cook mine longer so adjust your time for that.

Wellll... This dish was wonderfully tastey, but it did need ALOT of adjustments. Based on other reviews I was very carefull to cut the bread to exactly 1" (used a ruler) and I poured just enough custard to saturate the bread. Periodically as the bread absorbed the custard I would add more. When all was said and done there was 1 1/2 cups of custard left over. I cooked it in a glass pyrex dish at 325 for 45 minutes. It turned out perfect-not soggy at all. The blueberry sauce was amazing. I did add 2T of Grand Manier to the custard as another reviewer suggested, but did not feel it added much-maybe more is needed.

I'm sorry to report that I'm one of the minority reviewers who really didn't like this. I read through the reviews before attempting it and tried to ensure I didn't get the soggy, eggy center, but I did. I almost couldn't eat it.

I hate to be the voice of dissent, but I didn't think this French toast was anything superb. To be completely fair, I did use blueberries that were out of season, so that may have contributed to the sourness of the dish. However, even with the addition of the blueberry syrup, it wasn't enough to overcome the sourness. I read all the reviews prior to making this dish, so I reduced the milk to 2 1/2 cups and only 5 eggs, but I still thought the French "toast" was too soggy. It was certainly more like a bread pudding consistency. Next time, I'll stick with the Creme Brulee French Toast recipe on this site.

Excellent! To bring it up to four forks, maybe I could try adding some kind of liqueur :) Or maybe I should try making the syrup, which I'm sure would be great! FYI, I had to bake for 37 mins before the blueberry juice would start bubbling. And yes, there's a lot of milk, but since I soaked the bread for almost 24 hrs and baked for 37 mins, there wasn't a problem.

Just made this yesterday as part of a Father's Day Brunch - delicious. Everyone just loved it. After reading some of the reviews and comments of the generous portions, I decided to half the recipe. There were only five of us & one child. Half was just perfect with some left over! I made the syrup, which I'm glad I did - it was very good. The syrup would make a nice topping or glaze to serve with lemon bars or something! I really liked this recipe & received rave reviews from everyone who had it!!

I should have read all the reviews before making this dish. I used the 3 cups of milk and it was too much. I would cut back by half.

I would recommend this dish to anyone, especially with blueberries so plentiful this time of year.

We love blueberries and pecans so this was truly a treat! However, do pay attention to the suggestions of others. I halved the recipe and used A LOT less liquid - a little bit over 3/4 cup of skim milk and fat free half and half combined. The bread absorbed most of the liquid overnight so that it was not at all soggy when baked. The melted butter and brown sugar added before cooking help to keep the bread moist. Also it is not necessary to toast the pecans beforehand. They toast in the twenty minutes it takes to bake the dish. Easy and delicious!

Most excellent brunch dish. Was making creme brulee french toast (also from this site and also fabulous) before finding this recipe. This has added zing of the berries plus my husband loved the crunch of the pecans. I doubled the butter/brown sugar topping and would increase the pecans and blueberries next time. The blueberry sauce was yummy, even with leaving the blueberries in (no straining). So easy since its made ahead and is very impressive for guests.

I think this recipe is tops! Do try it - if you don't want it so sweet you could use a tart berry like fresh cranberries. I've made this a few times and I've had mixed reviews- although I've never had anyone dislike it. Some people are still talking about it and others were a bit underwhelmed. I think that if you are a bread-pudding lover you will make this dish over and over again. I have had different results and I believe the inconsistencies that people have mentioned have to do with the thickness of the bread slices. The first time I made it, I cut the bread thicker than the recipe called for and it turned out great. The second time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty moist. It makes a more custardy version with thin slices. Either way it is very good - if you have leftovers you can serve it with ice cream as another reviewer suggested.

This is a wonderful breakfast and dessert. I served the leftovers lightly warmed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and the blueberry syrup. Blueberries and pecans are among my favorites and I wouldn't skimp on either of them.

Rating: 4
Absolutely loved it! I would agree that it turns out a little bit soggy, so I would cut back on the liquid just a bit. I also used a combination of 2% milk and heavy cream for the whole milk. Otherwise, we think it's great with or without syrup and will be making it often. It's a great breakfast for Sunday mornings when you'd rather be relaxing with your coffee and the paper instead of fussing in the kitchen!

What a soggy mess. I did half the recipe, and ended up cooking 50 minutes. It was still dreadful. The pecans will butter and salt was delicious, but not enought to make again.

Rating: 4
Unbelievably good, and so easy. We didn't make the blueberry syrup, we found that the toast was sweet enough (with the brown sugar/butter drizzle) and syrup was unnecessary. I make this every time I have company, and I made it on Christmas morning, always to rave reviews.

A crowd pleaser and very easy to make also. My husband usually doesn't like french toast but could not get enough of this dish. I fed 7 people with this recipe and still had plenty leftover. Highly recommended!

I've made this recipe several times and although I agree it is tasty, the baking directions are definately not quite right. I have therefore found the recipe too uncertain to make again. If you try to make this, I'd read through all the other reviewers' comments-- they are quite helpful. The blueberry syrup is very good and easy to make.

This is a fantastic recipe--easy and delicious. I served it for a brunch of 15 people with mimosas, melon, scrambled eggs with chives and chicken mango sausages. I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of milk to 2 1/2 cups. In the future I would follow the recipe as written since I thought it was a little too eggy. I cooked it in a convection oven at 375 for 35-40 minutes. The guests raved about it--most had seconds and many requested the recipe.

Rating: 4
Eggs and milk should definitely be reduced to keep the center from getting soggy (perhaps even by half?). But even with soggy texture, still tastes great. I substituted 2% for whole milk and only drizzled half the butter. Chicken sausage balanced out the sweetness of the "french toast"--and fresh o.j. cut the richness of both.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful treat. I cut the recipe into one third since it was for just my husband and myself, and served it with chicken-apple sausage. Delicious. I wouldn't change a thing except to make the entire recipe for guests!

Rating: 4
Absolutely FABULOUS!!!! This is to die for. Be warned - it's really a bread pudding and it's decadent enough to be dessert (but life is short, right?). You'll need to know your oven - I did have to pop it back into the oven for an extra 10 minutes. DO NOT skip the pecan step - the roasting and salt is a delicious and necessary contrast to the sweet. I didn't have whole milk on hand so I used a combination of half & half and skim milk. I prefer the sauce strained as per the recipe - and people familiar with real maple syrup wouldn't dare screw up the sauce with cornstarch.

I loved this recipe. So easy to make and a great way to start off a sunday morning. Can't wait to make it again.

We have served this when friends have come for brunch. It is always a huge success. We only use half the amount of pecans called for in the recipe.

I soaked the bread 20 hours and found I had to bake it about 40 minutes at 400 degrees. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and we and our guests thought it was wonderful. I had planned to serve chicken-mango sausages too, but backed off. Would have been too much. Great dish!!!

This delicious dish is a good recipe for fathers' day breakfast. Put it together the night before when the kids are in bed. In the morning, just pop it into the oven and make the syrup. My husband is a chef and he was very IMPRESSED!

Rating: 3
I am surprised that this turned out with all the changes I made. I added 1 cup less of liquid to the milk mixture( I used half and half instead) and I did not soak overnight. I used a really soft french bread. I just let this sit about 15 minutes with the egg mixture on. The only thing I noticed was that the bread was very soft even after baking an additional 10 minutes. It was still good though. I only put one cup of blueberries on the toast; that was all I had. The blueberry syrup was wonderful. It was thin if you like thicker add a little cornstarch/water to it. I also only had a few pecans, I wish I would have had more.(This was a last minute throw together, can't you tell). The only reason I gave 3 forks instead of 4 was because of the bread being a bit too soft. Maybe actually soaking over night would better this. But this recipe is still delicious even w/o the soaking. Try it in a pinch.

Wonderful! Made 1/3 recipe: store bought sub-sandwich roll; buttermilk with a splash of ff 1/2 &1/2. Perfect! It made 3 healthy servings. A full recipe with eggs, sausage, fruit & juice would most definitly feed 10 very hungry people. I would double the syrup, tho.

I've been making this dish for for years, usually for company. Don't skip the pecan step - quite a nice contrast to the sweetness of the recipe. The syrup, by itself, makes a great Holiday gift in a cute jar... (Just refrigerate it...) Enjoy!

I am a serious home cook and I entertain about 30 weekends a year. I have been culling recipes from Gourmet for at least 20 years. -- This might just be my favorite recipe of all. Why? It is incredibly easy and very forgiving. It can be halved or quadrupled. You can substitute any ingredients you choose. Heck, you don't even need to measure, really. I made this yesterday (hot day in June) by popping the baking dish into my toaster oven for 25 minutes at 375 degrees. The result was a great as ever. I make it so often that I have learned to always keep a bag of blueberries and a small container of pecans in the freezer, just in case. Have you got a finicky kid? A man that won't commit? A particularly hard to impress in-law? Just make this for breakfast and they will be singing your praises in no time.

I thought this dish was fantastic. I soaked it for 24 hours and the texture in the center was a bit mushy--I think next time, I'll decrease the soaking time and the milk, based on the other suggestions. I did not bother to coat the pecans with butter and salt and it was fine (I did roast them for 8 minutes in the toaster oven). I think chopping the pecans would make it easier to eat but the presentation is beautiful if you leave them whole. The syrup is simple, but divine.

Rating: 4
I agree with others, I decreased the milk by one cup and also decreased the sugar. Had brunch for 10 and everyone loved it.

I made this for a special brunch and regretted it. After reading the reviews, I left it in the oven 45, only to burn the bottoms and remain with soggy centres. I think next time, I'll just fry them in a pan like usual. Otherwise, the recipe is quite good. Just don't use your oven.

My husband and I have never been ones to eat anything sweet in the morning. He has always indicated an intense dislike for French toast - UNTIL I MADE THIS RECIPE. WOW!!! Not only a snap to prepare, but a breakfast meal that has enjoyed many encores at my home!

I do a lot of small event catering. When my premier client wanted an "English Brunch" I found this recipe and combined it with Creamy Scrambled Eggs with Chives (from another part of the epicurious site) a fruit salad adorned with edible flowers, some tea breads, and giant Driscoll strawberries dipped in white and dark chocolate. She is still raving about the meal! While I only doubled the recipe to serve 20, the client had one steam-table pan of french toast left...which means this will serve many more than 6 if there are other entrees. I also tripled the syrup to be used if the "holding time" was too long and the toasts dried out. They did not.

I halved this recipe with great success. I filled a 9"x9" pan with the bread and continued from there. The cooking time for me was at 25 minutes and they were perfect. Great flavor and texture.

Made this for a Sunday Brunch for 30. This is the second time I've made this, and everyone loves it. I needed to bake it close to 50 minutes, and the middle was still a little runny, added blueberries halfway through baking and they kept their shape (the first time I added them at the beginning and they completely cooked down into a thick sauce, which wasn't too bad). I baked this exact recipe and then another with canned apple pie filling and cinnamon instead of blueberries, and both were a huge hit! Will make again.

Excellent recipe. Served it at a baby shower brunch and received rave reviews. Definately decrease milk to 2 1/2 cups and bake for 45 minutes. I would also suggest cutting the pecans into quarters.

Easy and delicious. I've made this three times and am bewildered that other reviewers had to bake longer. When I baked it 40 minutes, it burned, but came out perfectly at 20-30 min- utes. Perhaps they didn't use a large enough loaf and/or baking dish.

I made this for visiting relatives over the weekend, and even the picky kids had seconds! I followed the suggestions of a couple other reviewers, and it turned out great. I waited to put the blueberries on until the last 25 minutes, and the total time in the oven ended up being about 50 minutes. I left out the pecans only because I didn't have any on hand, and unlike some of the other reviewers, I did actually make the syrup, which was GREAT! Although the dish really is great by itself, the syrup truly makes it something special. I will definitely make it again!

Rating: 3
I would definitely make again. But next time I will not add the nuts and blueberries until the last 20 minutes. You defintely need to cook about 45 minutes, and my nuts and blueberries were overcooked. Very good dish - It does look like you've slaved all morning cooking it!

This was WONDERFUL!!! I was really tempted to buy Challah or any type of egg bread for this but resisted and got the baguette as called for in the recipe. It was perfect. All guests raved and said it was the best french toast they have ever had. I can't wait to try it with other fruits as well. I baked it for 45-50 minutes. Nobody thought additional syrup was needed.

Really sweet. I made it for Christmas morning but omitted the blueberries. I used thick cinnamon bread. It puffed up a lot in the oven and then fell. I cooked it approx an hour-- it wasn't nearly cooked enough after 25 minutes. I would use another recipe for baked french toast before repeating this one.

Rating: 4
Wonderful, rich, and worth it. Yes, there was so much extra egg mixture, so either make thick slices or bread or cram a lot in there. The blueberry syrup was unneccessary since there are already blueberries and so much sweetness. I've also made it without blueberries in the middle of winter. I may try raspberries next.

This recipe was fabulous and I was thrilled to experience a new way of making french toast. I agree with the others; 45 minutes bake time. I also agree with 2 1/2 cups milk instead of three. I didn't fully read the recipe before I began so I was only able to soak the liquid about 1 hour, but it was still delicious. The blueberry syrup was top notch and I will continue to use it for numerous things in the future. 1/2 the recipe feeds four generously.

Rating: 4
I wish I had read the reviews before I made this. Too soggy after 20 minutes, but still good. How about toasting the bread before soaking or baking it before putting the nuts and berries on top at a high heat in the oven. I will try both ways. I cut the recipe in half for two of us and it was still much to much. I would say half the recipe would feed four generously. I also cut the sugar and butter amount by one third and it was still "plenty sweet"!

I served it for Mother's Day brunch alongside lots of other dishes and it was the clear favorite. I agree with the others about having to bake it longer - mainly to wait for the excess liquid to absorb. I passed it along to a friend and suggested she use 2 1/2 cups of milk rather than 3.

I have made this several times always to rave reviews. It is so much easier than "regular" french toast, particularly for a crowd.
