I added peanuts instead of walnuts. I also wanted it alittle spicey so I added 3 banana peppers

Had to sub pine nuts for walnuts. Came out great. Did add a bit more vinegar than called for.

I'm a bit of a health nut so I roasted my own red pepper and added it to the sun-dried tomatoes from the package, not the kind that come in oil. I also cut the amount of olive oil in half and used a bit of extra vinegar. These changes drastically cut the fat content of this recipe without sacrificing the flavor (just make sure the pepper is roasted almost black for that smoky taste!)The result was a huge hit. Even my vegan friends, who are experts at vegetarian recipes, couldn't stop complimenting it!

Very good but be careful of the oil. The first batch was too oily so in the second batch I reduced the oil by half, was very generous with the veggies, the vinegar & salt and it was much better.

This recipe was so easy and I got rave reviews. I served it with Leslie Stowe crackers on the side and everyone loved it. An easy wow.

I made this for a dinner party. As one of my guests put it, "This is something you either love or hate." He loved it, I wasn't so fond. I would definitely make it again especially with an assortment of vegetable dips because the flavor/texture is unique and make a wonderful contrast to the more traditional sour cream/mayonnaise based dips.

Great recipe! I made it as suggested several times for different parties and each time people ask for the recipe. We use it as a vegetable dip. VERY VERY GOOD!

The second time I made this recipe, I added a teaspoon of freshly chopped rosemary, using the tender leaves only.

I made this for a party and our guests really enjoyed it. I thought it was quite good as written (and certainly easy), however next time I might add a bit of fresh basil to give it a little more interest. Toasting the walnuts is key, as is seasoning well with salt. I also think thinning this out a bit and serving it over cream cheese as a spread would be nice too.
