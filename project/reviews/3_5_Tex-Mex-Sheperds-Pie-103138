We have barbequed the meat in advance with great success. Afterwards, instead of dicing the meat we "pulled" it (as in a Pulled Pork Sandwich). Whether we bake or BBQ the meat we first put BBQ sauce on it. We use fresh mashed potatoes, not frozen as suggested in the recipe. Also, we like to take two buds of garlic, lob off the tops, pour some olive oil over them, wrap them in foil and bake or BBQ them. When the garlic is cooked to the point of being soft (before the chicken is done), we unwrap them and squish them over the potatoes and mash them in as we think that garlic mashed potatoes go very well on this dish.

We've made this recipe a few times and always double it as everyone wants seconds. We're not sure why it says it makes 2 servings as it is 4 servings for sure. We like to BBQ the chicken with BBQ sauce on it and then "pull" the chicken instead of dicing it. For the potatoes we always make fresh mashed potatoes to which we add roasted garlic. We sometimes add a cup of corn to the recipe as well. We've yet to serve this to anyone who didn't like it.

Do weekday dinners get much easier?? I added frozen peas, corn and pearl onions because I had them and they added some color and good flavor. Also, used chipotle salsa which was wonderful. Also, used mozzarella cheese which was fine too. Overall a snap and delish!!

I love this, delicious, quick and easy. However, sheperds pie it is not as you always make that with lamb or cottage pie with beef. Pedantic, I know, but the thought of sherperds herding chickens makes me laugh.

I gave this an extra point for being so easy. I was honestly surprised how good this was; even most of the kids (some very picky!) ate it. I did double the cheese with regular Monterey Jack and skipped the cilantro (not a huge fan). I made my own Yukon Gold mashed potatoes with just butter & the water from boiling the potatoes. Very yummy!

This was exceptionally good for what should have been a minimum of work recipe, but I made a few mistakes on my 1st attempt. I used the last cup in a jar of picante sauce (instead of salsa) and used a tiny bit of water to get the last of the sauce out of the jar. Mixed the chicky, picante, and beans in a bowl prior to putting the mixture into the pie plate. It looked SO soupy that I added about 3/4 cup of L/O cooked plain white rice. I used my own H/M mashed potatoes (no formal recipe: they contain 2% milk and diet margarine). They were partially defrosted. My 9" pie plate was SO full, and the mixture was SO watery around the edges that I KNEW it would boil over, so I blotted some water off the edge with paper towels. But it remained looking like a mess. Put it on a foil-lined pizza pan, minus any cheese or cilantro. Had accidentally only pre-heated the oven to 400 degrees (because that was the way my recipe was written several years ago). After 20 minutes, SURPRISE--IT HAD NOT BOILED OVER. Then I added the cheese and cilantro and baked it about another 40 minutes, and it was SUPER DELICIOUS!

Winter favorite. Well drained ground pork, sausage or beef work well too.

This was easy and a huge hit at my house. All 4 kids loved it and I added corn so I felt it was healthy too!

Was pleasantly surprised with this dish. Added frozen corn, used garden Fresh Jack's salsa and rotisserie chicken from the supermarket and really liked it. We found that it actually gave us 4 servings not 2. GReat for weeknights.

Easy & excellent. I used grilled chicken breast, cut up in small squares, and used sliced pepperjack cheese. The flavors are wonderful.

Quick and easy! Made this last night with Roasted Chicken from the grocery store. Shredded the chicken instead of diced. Made a batch of mashed potatoes (basic recipe) and put all the ingredients together. Hearty dinner! Used one whole can of beans and doused the chicken and beans with salsa til I thought it was enough. Husband loved it. Had enough for 4 dinner servings and 2 for leftovers!

This was very good and easy to make. I doubled the cheese. I cubed the chicken but think that it would be better shredded for this recipe.

This is a good, throw-together meal. I wouldn't serve it as a company meal, but it's good for the family.

Easy after work dinner. A twist on an old classic. I like it with extra cheese.

I served it last night and it was a heavenly experience! I noticed the name is only Tex Mex Sheperd's Pie. I was hoping to name this after my friend Jesus who has a Tex-Mex background. Jesus's Sheperds Pi. A few easy steps and Bingo! heavenly bliss

I will definitely make this one again. I used prepared garlic mashed potatoes, from the refrigerator section in the grocery. And I also used plain monterey jack cheese and double the chicken. It was great!

My very picky teenage son who hates beans loved this and told me it was definitely a "keeper". I seasoned the beans (used dried beans) with salt, pepper, cumin, chile powder, garlic pwdr., and dried minced onions while the bean were cooking. Delicious!

This is a great dish. It is very easy to make, and the comments from the family were all positive. I tend to be a spice "whimp" and therefore I used a mild salsa, however I think even I could use a medium salsa.

Wonderful dish, spicy but not too spicy. It takes a little longer to prepare when you boil and cube the chicken and make fresh mashed potatoes but the final result is definitely worth the effort. Served with a small salad it's a great meal definitely worth repeating.

This is so easy and so good! My fiancee now has a new favorite meal. I highly recommend you make this. I used Reeser's salsa which is chucky. It turned out great!

I had done a lot of holiday baking today and was looking for an easy but satisfying dinner. This was perfect. My husband loves no frills kind of meals and this was right up his alley. This is a keeper! Next time, I will use more than 1/2 cup of cheese. Also I got more than 2 servings.

I tried this recipe for the first time about four months ago. Since then, I've made it three more times and each time, it's delicious! It's super-easy to make, and turns out savory and filling. My fiance loves it too, though he likes it as a side dish, whereas I use it as an entree.

YOU CAN'T COOK GOURMET FOODS EVERYDAY, THIS IS A WINNER THAT KIDS WILL LIKE AND IS REASONABLE TO MAKE AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK.

Rating: 3
This is not gourmet but you should be able to tell that by looking at the ingredients. On the other hand it is super easy and fast and yummy. It is always the recipe I turn to when I don't feel like spending the evening in the kitchen. Great food!

Well, this used up some cooked chicken I had in the freezer, and I had the other ingredients on hand, so didn't head out to the grocery store. Otherwise, it tasted pretty much like a recipe in a salsa ad.
