For a great Daikon salad, julienne 1 large radish, then add a generous sprinkle of sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. Add about 2 tsp best quality extra virgin olive oil plus the juice of one lime. The lime is key. Toss and serve - it's fabulous. If desired, you can add a tbsp or less of minced cilantro. This is a very fast way to make a great daikon salad.
