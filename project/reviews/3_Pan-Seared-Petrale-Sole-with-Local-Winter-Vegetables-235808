boring and bland.

Rather bland. To add interest: Delete beans Add extra garlic and two hot dried chili peppers to vegetables after they are in the skillet for a few minutes. Sprinkle fresh thyme, salt and pepper on fish and place on top of vegetables in the skillet. Cover and cook on low heat for 10 - 15 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges and fresh chopped parsley.

I used Lemon Sole and breaded it with unseasoned panko bread crumbs. Slightly thicker fillets didn't fall apart but were still delicate. Family loved it.

I used flounder and it fell apart quite easily and stuck to the nonstick pan (even with hot olive oil in there). The fish was very plain but the vegetables were ok. Nothing special.

I used petrale sole. The fish only needed 2 minutes per side and was very delicate - the fillets started falling apart in the pan. I suspect this type of fish needs to be breaded before cooking, to help hold it together.

Excellent dish for a supper party easy to prepare in advance and quick to cook. I used lemon sole and the flavour was delicious.
