Thank you, thank you, thank you for having this recipie! I lost my grandmother's version. I could remember the ingredients but not the proportions. As soon as I saw this I recognized everything. But if you want it really authentic, leave out the red bell pepper and add 1T celery seed, and add a pinch of alum to the brine.
