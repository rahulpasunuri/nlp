Like a previous reviewer, we made this with local grass fed beef and we also made the aioli suggested by another. And it was all pretty good, although it really was not as tasty, to us, as a good old american burger, grilled to perfection with salt and pepper only, served with lettuce, tomato and mayo.

I'm not a meat eater, but we found some organic, local, grass-fed, humanely processed beef at our farmer's market, and I wanted to prepare it simply and taste it. Used rosemary as a substitute for thyme. Followed the suggestion to make the aoli - was fabulous - really made the burger. Lots of lemon juice and zest, generous salt and pepper, mayo, rosemary, and garlic. Perfect with the red onion and arugula. Very sophisticated mixture of flavors. Worth the brief respite as a carnivore!

These burgers were really good. Though I used extra-lean ground beef, so they were a little dry.

Here is perfection... Make a thyme mayo w/fresh thyme, mayo, lemon zest, lemon juice, dijon, salt and pepper. Slather on both buns. With the red onion and arugula...yum. That is what this burger needs. SO good.

Excellent burger. Using freshest ingredients are a must. Have made, cooked and served and also made in advance by a day for a camping trip. Don't assemble more than several hours ahead of time as the thyme looses its character. As simple as it seems, this is very, very good.

This is a decent, everyday recipe for hamburgers- not phenomenal, but pretty good. The mayonnaise, chopped red onion and arugula were nice flavors with a burger. A good recipe for the family.
