Excellent. The value of this recipe lies in the sauce; it is perfect though you should only use half of it or it will be overwhelming. I freely improvise with the salad. I regularly omit the fish cakes and wonton skins and, when in a hurry, pare the salad down to the very basics: chicken, fried noodles, and lettuce. Finally, I would highly recommend oranges as either a side dish or incorporated within the salad itself.

Zero forks. This was all but inedible. (I have never rated a recipe this low until now.) There was way too much teriyaki sauce, in my opinion, which made it impossible to taste anything else. After having experienced this, I'm trying to make sense of the other rave reviews. Well, thanks for listening... I'm off to drink another bottle of water.

Yummy and healthy. Used fresh cucumber and fresh bean sprouts and a variety of lettuce and spinach and ommitted the fish cakes and kimchee. Chicken was flavorful and the dressing just right. Did use fried noodles from the grocery store, but next time will definitely attempt the fried wontons for better taste.

Easy and excellent recipe. I used hearts of romaine lettuce instead of iceberg; skipped the kimchee and fish cakes. I bought crunchy lo mein noodles from the Asian section of the supermarket, so there was no need to deep fry wonton skins or noodles. I also added canned waterchestnuts.

I agree with all the other comments. Tasty and refreshing, and no need for the fish cake or kimchi (I used cucumbers, too). I might try using cabbage next time and letting it sit overnight to soak up all the juices. Yummy!

Making this one for the second time - by demand! Refreshing and crisp, and the chicken coated with sesame seeds is marvelous. Didn't use the fish cake or kimchee, and passed on the wonton skins since I use the thin rice noodles. Had a problem getting the rice noodles to be consistently cooked until I started using smaller batches. Added a little raw spinach in addition to romaine lettuce. Superb dish and looks incredible on the plate.

I agree about the sliced cucumber instead of kimchee. The teriyaki sauce was a bit to salty for my taste. Other than that, it was an okay recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe, however I think that it would be even more wonderful if the fish cake were omitted. I like fish cake but not in this salad. Thinly sliced cucumbers instead of cucumber kim chee is more refreshing.
