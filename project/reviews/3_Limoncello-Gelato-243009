Just a question - why are there coffee beans in a limoncello gelato recipe??? Is this a misprint? The two definately do not go together!

I'm sorry some cooks were disappointed. I've made this a couple of times and it has been swoon, as well as spoon, worthy. The only question we had was, "Does the limoncello on top really add much?" Hope my luck holds as it will be the finale for a pan seared halibut dinner Sat. night.

If your ice cream is curdling, do what we do in professional kitchens: blend. Then strain. Fixed. All youre doing is actually cooking the eggs, perhaps more than you need to, but its not the end of the world. This resipe is nowhere near a traditional gelato, which has no eggs. Good flavor, but no eggs are necessary.

I made this according to the directions and it turned out with a nice texture and balanced vanilla and lemon flavor. Love it!

I really enjoyed this gelato as did my guests (we are big limoncello fans). Would definetely make again. Did not find the texture to be grainy.

A comment/question not a review --- why make this recipe of the day if only 25% will make it again??

Custard curdling will cause this to be grainy, but I doubt that's what has been happening with everyone's experiences. If anyone curdles this type of custard, there would be no question that it shouldn't be used - you'd have scrambled egg soup. Mascarpone is the most likely culprit for the graininess, as over-churning will cause the solids in it to separate, and most home ice cream makers don't freeze quick enough to avoid this.

I followed the recipe to the letter. I cooked the custard to a temperature of 180 degrees and chilled it overnight. After processing in an ice cream machine, I stored it in a plastic container in the freezer. When I tried it, I found the texture grainy as well. What a disappointment after all the prep time! The custard didn't curdle, nor do I believe that would cause a grainy texture!

I agree with the first reviewer. I made the recipe and found it to have a grainy texture and off taste. I believe it was due to the addition of the mascarpone cheese. I will not make this particular recipe again.

I disagree with the previous reviewer. This gelato has a very good flavor. S/he missed the part where the coffee beans are part of the first 6 ingredients to be mixed together at the start. However, s/he is ABSOLUTELY correct that this mixture MUST be strained before freezing. The only downside to this recipe is that the vanilla bean is overpowered by the lemon flavor. It probably isn't worth the trouble or expense of using a bean for this recipe -- extract might do just as well. The grainy texture experienced by the other reviewer was probably due to overcooking the custard, which will cause curdling. I didn't have this issue, and I was happy with both flavor and texture of this gelato.

I was so disappointed in this recipe. The flavor was lovely--nice and lemony--but the texture was grainy. Probably caused by the lemon rind. I won't make this again, but would recommend straining before freezing to anyone else who wishes to try it. Also, the recipe omitted to tell you when to put in the coffee beans, also when to remove them and the vanilla bean. I added the coffee beans at the same time as the vanilla, and the removed them all just before chilling the mixture. Additionally, the mixture took closer to 20 minutes to come to "coat the spoon" stage (180 degrees). Altogether a huge disappointment.
