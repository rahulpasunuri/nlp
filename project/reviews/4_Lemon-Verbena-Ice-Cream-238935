Made this just as directed, and while it was lovely, it wasn't as creamy as other ice creams I've made, and left that coated feeling in your mouth - probably from all the fat. Have experienced this with other recipes before, but not all, including some with many more eggs than this. Careful who you serve this to - some people find this kind of floral flavor bewitching, while others will feel it tastes like soap or a candle. Anyway, love lemon verbena, and served it with berries to cut the fatty mouth feel. Next time, will try the other lemon verbena ice cream recipe on this site.

I planted lemon verbena in my herb garden and decided to try this recipe. As noted, with fresh verbena, it was one of the best ice creams I've made for my guests. Well worth finding fresh verbena for anyone to try. I'm making it again this weekend for a small dinner party dessert with pumpkin cookies.

Absolutely delish! I was concerned that the lemon verbena would taste like a candle. No way. Wonderfully sweet. Served with a berry galette. The perfect combo!

This ice cream is one of the easiest and best I've ever made. The taste is so delightful. I planted verbena because I've always wanted to, and when this came out in Gourmet this summer, I knew it was a must- try. Well, I've made it 3 times now and hope to bring my verbena inside for the winter so I can make it all year long!

WOW! Sublime! Strained the lemon verbena before adding the eggs, and thought the flavor was just right, wouldn't have wanted it any stronger. Served with a blackberry-blueberry sauce made with organic blueberry jam, frozen blackberries, a half vanilla bean, and honey - cooked down slighlty and served warm. Also served with cornmeal cookies from this website, with chopped pistachios and demera sugar added to the top of cookies before baking. Perfect combination in my opinion!!!

Delicious ice cream. I was looking for a recipe for lemon verbena since my plants needed a trim. It was so easy and came out perfectly.
