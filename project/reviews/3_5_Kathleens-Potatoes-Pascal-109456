Easy, flavorful, decadent. Generous amounts of salt and pepper between layers make this dish a compliment to any meat dish. It's a staple in our home, whether paired with simple steaks off the bbq or with a more sophisticated roast.

Awesome recipie. So few ingredients...so much taste. Have made many times. But it is rich so I serve only on special occassions.Tried it with lighter cream...not as good.

This is a fabulous recipe. My family loves it. My daughter proclaimed after her first bite, "Wow these will be the potatoes we have for special meals from now on--Christmas, Easter, my birthday." Have made repeatedly--guess all that cream does the trick!

This recipe was just plain disappointing,it lacked flavor.It was no more then a scallop casserole,like my Mom would have made. Not for company,but would work for a dinner the night before pay day. Would strongly not recommend making this recipe.

I have made this several times. it is perfect for a holiday prime rib dinner. I add 3-4 garlic cloves scattered throughout, and am generous with the salt and pepper.

This recipe is so simple, I didn't think it would be as good as it was. Delicious! My husband loved it. I enjoyed it so much I had it for breakfast the next day. There is only one thing I'd change. More garlic. Being a big garlic fan, I knew one clove wouldn't cut it for me, so I put in two. Next time I'll be sure to put in at least 4 cloves.
