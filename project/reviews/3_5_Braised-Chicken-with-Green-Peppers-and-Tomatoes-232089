I made as directed. It was definitely easy to make but it wasn't very flavorful. I liked adding the parsley with the onions. When making it the next time though, I may add a tablespoon of butter to the pan before I toss in the onions.

For me, the dish was okay. Not my favorite, by far. But decent.

Made this because it looked easy. Really good. I did add some leftover sauteed wild mushrooms (with garlic and parsley) at the end, which surely enhanced it. Tomatoes were San Marzano. Also used pinot noir instead of white wine, as I had an open bottle that I didn't want to waste. Added the chopped parsley at the end for freshness and color. I think that adding the peppers with the tomatoes instead of sauteeing with the onions results in their being milder and sweeter. Look forward to making it as written (except for the early parsley)to see if it's still as good.

I used dried parsley as that was what I had on hand and a good white wine. I added a small thai chili pepper because it looked lonely in the fridge, and about a tablespoon of capers. Because I don't like chunks of tomatoes, I took a hand blender to the sauce to break them up a bit. The sauce was delicious, with just a bit of heat and the capers added a nice bite. I served it with homemade sweet cornbread, which I used to sop up the yummy sauce.

Nice and simple dish.

guests don't like peppers so I replaced with fresh green beans; also threw in some fresh oregano. It's not a show stopper but a very nice, simple, Quick! casual main with a mushroom risotto.

Not impressed with this recipe. It was easy to make but was definitely boring and lacked flavor. I added mushrooms and some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit but still not a keeper for my recipe book.

Notwithstanding all the recommended additions, a mediocre recipe.

This was wonderful. I added the mushrooms and kept the wine. We used peppers from the garden, and everyone raved about it.

So easy to make and very satisfying to eat on a cool night. I followed the recipe with exception of the addition of sliced fresh mushrooms and one extra green bell pepper. Served over steamed brown rice with a good large spoonful of the delicious sauce. A keeper!

i really don't like bell peppers so i replaced them with 10 oz sliced mushrooms. this dish was tasty (with my substitution), easy, and inexpensive to prepare. it makes a good healthy, easy weekday meal, although some added spice or flavor wouldn't hurt it. i served it with israeli couscous and sprinkled toasted pine nuts over it.

My family and I loved this recipe. I do question whether to add the parsly when the recipe tells you in the beginning of the cooking. I always thought fresh herbs were suppose to be added at the end of a recipe. I didn't taste the parsley at all. But the recipe has a lot of flavor from the vegetables. Very good!

Loved the flavor of this. I used chicken broth instead of wine and added italian seasonings. The chicken ends up very tender and juicy with lots of flavors. The colors of the peppers and tomatoes are fantastic. I served it over white rice (Spanish style) with a tomato and avocado salad. Yum!

I cook from Epicurious 4-5 times per week and I've never rated a recipe, but this one deserves a hearty endorsement. I don't care for green peppers but some came with our CSA share this week so I had to find a way to use 'em. This dish is better than the ingedient list suggests at first glance. Once the flavors cook together, it becomes a very tasty, satisfying dish. I'd even serve it to fussy guests. You probably could substitute chicken broth for the wine (as some reviewers suggest) but the dish would be missing the richness that the wine adds. I cooked it according to the recipe, departing from it only to add a handful of chopped spinach. Oh, and I mistakenly bought skinless thighs with bones, which turned out to be fine. The next time I make this I'll probably add a pinch of red pepper flakes to spice it up. Wonderful recipe!

This was OK but kind of bland so I added Italian Herbs & got rave reviews. So...I would make again but only with that addition.

Good, relatively healthy, simple dish for quick weeknight cooking. I like the fact that it has few ingredients and the ones that it does use are ones that usually have lying around anyway. You could probably substitute chicken breasts, but you would have to be very careful not to overcook. This recipe probably calls for thighs because it needs the extra flavor that thighs have. Not interesting enough to serve to guests.

My son loved how tender the chicken was. The rest of us felt it was good, but not outstanding. It's not a terribly unique recipe, but the chicken was moist, and the recipe does not require constant monitoring. Served over penne pasta with steamed green beans. I think vermouth or chicken broth could be substituted for the white wine.

As a cooking beginner, this dish was as fun to make as it was to eat. My fiancee said it was one of the best meals ever cooked in her kitchen, and considering that her mom cooks traditional polish food for hours whenever she visits, that says a lot. If you are a single guy looking to impress a special someone, make this recipe, the time invested is worth it. The only question I have though, is why not use chicken breasts instead of thighs?

this dish was real good it makes me think of chicken caccatore without several other ingredients. i really don't care for wine in my food so i added chicken broth.

This was delicious. Next time I will try it with chicken breasts because we had so many thighs left over compared to the amount of sauce. Served once with rice, another time with egg noodles. The total time was close to 2 hours for me (preparation, cooking the chicken in batches, frying, etc.).

As I read this recipe, I thought it sounded good. While cooking, I wasn't too sure anymore. But it was actually pretty good. Nothing exciting, but a decent weekday dinner.
