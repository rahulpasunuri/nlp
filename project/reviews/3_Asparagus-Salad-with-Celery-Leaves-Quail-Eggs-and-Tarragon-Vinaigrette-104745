I would make variations of this salad again but made as written the celery leaves really overpower everything else in the salad it was even too much for me and I really like celery. Unfortunatly I don't know anyone else that does. So second time I mixed some mesclun greens with the celery leaves. little grape tomatoes halved echo the adorable quail eggs. I have also made this with small chicken eggs just for myself.

This recipe has a distinctive good flavour which disintegrates in about a day. About half of my guests liked it.

Served this for out-of-town guests who have traveled the world. They loved it. Delightfully different and very easy.

Great salad with no changes. We now make the dressing as one of our routine dressings for a plain green salad. Very few recipes deserve a full four forks. This is one that does.

I'm LOL at you Cook because of course Paul knows that when comments are updated, previous postings are deleted. Paul updated his comment incognito. He is not only mischievous and clever, but fun. Yo, yo, yo! Hey Paul, I take delight in your banter. Interesting people make the world more enjoyable, so ignore the uptight remarks OR JUST LET THEM TICKLE YOUR FANCY.

I enjoy Paul's reviews. Unlike what you have just done, he actually reviews the recipes. "If you complain about having to read drivel, why are you contributing more of it?" Keep cooking and reviewing Paul, you've got a fan in Lexington.

Perhaps if "kitten"s friend could figure out where he/she lives,(and go back to dishwashing), he/she could provide Paul with an e-mail address, and you two idiots could communicate directly, thereby eliminating the frustration we feel at constantly reading your drivel on this site. (Oh, by the way Paul, each time you write comments regarding a recipe, your prior comments on that page are automatically erased! Saves us all from your long-windedness)

I made this for Easter (with the help of my wonderful daughter-in-law) and it was a big success. I substituted: light olive oil for the exotic oil, regular (but less) mustard as I was out of dijon, and I misread and put the shallots in the salad instead of in the dressing. The quail eggs were a cute touch, but small eggs would have done. I only used one/person.

i'm slowly graduating from dishwasher to exec. chef in my own kitchen, and this recipe was exhilerating. i was overjoyed to see that it made no mention of peas. . . i love you kitten.

Recipe was great. Quail eggs and tarragon vinegar(a domesicated version-available by the dozen at most good grocery stores) are a nice take on the classic chopped egg yolk, lemon vinaigrette version. [Users-please remember this is a rating page not a personal chat room-I had to go back 3 pages to get a recipe rating, Thanks]

Hi Nashville. Exact how deeply flattered I am that you think I'm Paul, sadly, you probably will never know. Alas, you're barking up the wrong tree, honey. Paulette, maybe.

I like reading Paul's input. There is something about his way with words that is very engrossing. And the way he refers to himself in the third-person? It's great.

Levity--yes. Teasing--yes. Bashing--no. i.e. the reviews for rhubarb-cranberry cobbler on this site. To infer that one is stupid because of an innocent question as a new cook/chef or to make a typo reminds me of the bullies on the playground. They needed to feel important, also. They were insecure & got their kudos by putting the stronger and really more intelligent people down. I would like to think that this site is scanned by people beyond the junior high school mentality. If not, the next thing I read is that someone has been told to shove their head in the toilet bowl because of a "stupid" question or comment.

Sorry guys, didn't mean to offend. I know cooking is serious business and there is no room for levity

This is a tasty recipe and an excellent way to introduce some necessary foods. Using newly harvested, in-season foods has a traditional basis in human health. Many of spring's foods are meant to help us detox after the sedentary and immune-assaulting winter. Asparagus helps our body renew itself, too. For those of you who despair of findling quail eggs ... which are delightful ... check out Oriental grocery stores, particularly Japanese stores. You will also be able to find the little gadgets for compressing regular eggs as part of sushi making etc., there, so you could make regular eggs more interesting for this dish. And for the people who wrote such scathing reviews, which unfortunately appear at this time on the first page ... this is supposed to be epiCURIOUS! Where is YOUR curiosity? Great recipe! Do try it.

Way too funny! I agree, quail eggs? Jeesh. I am LMAO at Paul's comments.

Looks pretty good to me and I like to try new ideas. Sad to say asparagus is out of season here in New Zealand winter's on the way - will certainly give it a go when asparagus is in season here. Sorry to read about the alarm and despondency about quail eggs. Come down to Wellington NZ and go to Moore Wilson's foodmarket - quail eggs available there - saw them this morning!

ASPARAGUS IN SEASON IS A DELIGHT; THE MAGIC OF ADDING QUAIL'S EGGS IS PERFECT. WE ARE LUCKY HERE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA - ALMOST EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS ITS OWN QUAIL SANCTURARY AND DRIVEWAYS ARE LITTERED WITH EXCESS QUAIL EGGS. FOR THE UNLUCKY, TRY OSTRICH EGGS - A LITTLE OVERPOWERING BUT ONE EGG SERVES A HUNDRED.

Quail eggs are delicious. I get really fresh ones from a hunt club in the country not far from my Chicago suburb. They are also available at many gourmet food shops. Haven't tried the recipe but it sounds delicious; will make it today.

I loved this recipe! If you have a problem with quail eggs, but still want to maintain the interest, try making "cubed" hard boiled eggs. You can buy a plastic form that you put a hot freshly hard-boiled egg into. By screwing down the top, the egg takes the shape of the cube container. When sliced cold, you have interesting squares of egg to add to this delicious recipe!

I have a question could you substitute two or three small regular eggs for the Quail eggs? I haven't made it yet as I really don't want to use Quail eggs. But if regular eggs will do it I will try it as think it looks interesting.

With real homemade Dijon mustard - a great salad

it isn't really fair for me to review this recipe since i have not made the dish, but for some reason anything that calls for quail eggs gives me a royal pain in the you-know-what.
