Delicious. Doubled the lemon peel and pine nuts. Also sprinkled the top with raw sugar for a crunchy crust. Oh, and I used dried cherries instead of raisins. The loaf quickly disappeared. I used the amount of sugar called for in the recipe, and didn't think it was too sweet.

This recipe really surprised me, you'd never know it's made with olive oil. It's got a great texture, so good for breakfast with a cup of coffee. You can easily cut back sugar, I use 3/4 cup. I would definitely add zest of an extra lemon. I often leave out pine nuts and raisins and like it just as much. One of those recipes that's great as is, but plenty of room to tweak depending on tastes and what you have on hand.

Very good. I made extensive changes but I was impressed with the outcome. I used cake flour, added 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsps lemon juice, added walnuts, and used eggnog instead of milk. It came out nicely dense and moist with a lightly spicy and refreshing flavor. It didn't rise the way I expected though so next time I might increase the b. powder and beat less.

This is an excellent sweet bread. I actually made two: one with lemon zest and one with lemon oil. The lemon oil made a pithier, stronger flavor while the zest made a lighter lemon flavor. Both were good, though. Toasts well, I plan to try it w/cream cheese and prosciutto as an appetizer.

Very easy and very tasty! Bread comes out moist and with a nice light lemon flavor. Would work well with other types of nuts and dried fruit too!

This was so easy and really good. I didn't have any pine nuts and don't usually care for raisins in my breads, so I made a few changes. I used coarsely chopped walnuts and 2 tablespoons of rosemary. The lemon just hints at its presence and the olive oil isn't detectible at all, but makes the bread so dense and moist. This recipe would lend itself to so many variations with various fruits and nuts. So fast, so easy and delish.

I love this recipe. It takes 10 minutes to put together, makes the house smell amazing and is a light, delicious treat. One error in the directions - it says "Beat well" but this is a quickbread and that will *ruin* the cake by developing too much gluten in the flour. Most epicurious fans probably knew this and adjusted naturally, but if you share this recipe with an inexperienced cook, tell them to mix the wet and dry ingredients separately first, combine them and mix just until moist, then add the zest, mix a couple more turns around the bowl and put it in the pan. This process takes 30 seconds longer than the "dump and stir" approach but the cake comes out beautiful and golden every time!

My 8 year old son gave this a "thumbs-up". It tastes a little like those Italian pignola nut cookies I used to buy at Christmas when I lived in New York. The crust is crumbly-hard and the inside is dense and moist. Iit rises very nicely and holds it shape even after it has cooled. It did take longer than the recipe states to finish baking-about 15 minutes longer. (I used an 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 professional weight loaf pan.) Very nice, especially given that no butter is used. I used fat free milk, golden raisins and 3/4 cup of sugar, which seems like just the right amount to me. A very nice bread for tea with the girls while the kids are in school!

It was great! I'm definitely going to make it again! The only change I made was add a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup.

This truly is a nice, light breakfast bread. I've never been a big fan of pine nuts, but they work great in this recipe; although I initially thought of leaving them out, I'm glad I didn't. The lemon zest matures a day or so after you've baked this, and seems to get more delicious by the day.

Really excellent recipe, and very easy to make. The bread was moist, slightly sweet, a touch lemony, very delicious. Everybody raved about it. I will definitely make it again.

I am so impressed! This was so easy and SO delicious. I could have used even more lemon flavor. Might add some juice next time or even a second lemon to zest. And the olive oil is good for you! Took like 10 minutes to get into the oven.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. I decided to cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and left out the pine nuts and raisins. I served this cut into small slices with Olive tapenade and irish cheese, FANTASTIC!

Moist, delicious, and easy to boot! I followed the directions exactly, it just took 8 minutes longer than directed to bake. The lemon flavor mixed with the pine nuts is exceptional!

Followed the recipe exactly, but made it into baby loafs - it made three and they cooked in about 30 minutes. Good hostess gift!

This was excellent, I didn't add raisins, pine nuts, or lemon zest as I didn't have them on hand. I also added about 1/2 t organic hazelnut extract and topped bread with sprinkled turbinado sugar before baking. I'm eating it with asian coconut jam and it's great.

I used chopped hazelnuts and no raisins. It was quite good.

This recipe is excellent on its own. I didn't have lemon zest, rasins, or pine nuts. Instead, I used 1 tsp. lemon juice and walnuts in the dough. Yum. With a pineapple ring and some mini marshmallows in between two pieces, melted butter and a bit of brown sugar brushed on top, all broiled together, I had a perfect dessert.

I tossed a 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries into the flour mix (didn't have pine nuts), and used half brown sugar and half white for a total of 3/4 cup. Also, after I grated the zest, I squeezed the juice from the lemon into the batter. Took 65 minutes to cook. Delicious and quick and easy and crusty and a lovely color to boot.

Excellent, simple recipe. It could also function well as a coffeecake base, although it is a bit dense. Stays moist.

Very tasty. I used orange zest and Grand Marnier as another reviewer suggested. Try it!

I have made this so many times so many different ways! Tastes gread as bread or cake from a springform pan. Also great as muffins. Did not use pine nuts, but almonds and flax seeds instead. Tastes ten times better when using millet flour or brown rice flour.

I gave it 4 forks because not only is it absolutely delicious, but a snap to prepare as well! And "healthy" to boot! I definitely recommend increasing the amount of lemon zest, and substituting slivered almonds for the pine nuts didn't detract from the flavor. I'm going to try making this into muffins next time!

Delicious and no butter! Instead of using raisins I used chopped dried apricot turned out great. Although next time I think I will stir in pine nuts and sprinkle some on top. Excellent bread with a wonderful crunchy crust.

At this time of the year it's easy to overdose on overly sweet, rich desserts, and I found this to be the perfect antidote. This is a delicious, not-to-sweet dessert or tea bread. The batter tasted a bit too much like olive oil at first, but the lemon zest perfectly counterbalanced it, and the only evidence of olive oil in the final product was a dense and moist bread, and a crisp and crunchy crust. I ended up leaving mine in the oven for 5 or 10 minutes longer than suggested, and, at the suggestion of the cook below, substituted dried cherries for the raisins. wonderful.

This bread is an excellent sweet bread. I'm sure to make it many times. The crust is delightfully crunchy over a moist and tender inside. As I had no pine nuts, I used almond slivers instead, very good, but I'd like the pine nuts better I'm sure. I also substituted dried cherries for the raisins. Wonderful tartness with the sweet bread. Listening to other cooks, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 C. With the full lemon zest, it was great.

This recipe totally surprised me. It's so good, so easy. The 2nd time I made it I forgot the pine nuts and missed them. I would leave out some of the sugar; it's a little too sweet.

My whole family loved this bread. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup the second time I made it and I like it better. The texture is delicate and makes an impressive "tea bread".

Wonderful and so easy. I've made this over and over in the past few months. It's great if you follow the recipe, but a good variation is replacing the lemon zest with orange zest and a splash of Grand Marnier. Enjoy!

I have made this bread several times. It is now a regular around the house when guests come. It is delicious for breakfast, snack or to compliment an Italian meal. Mixing the pine nuts in does keep them in the bread, but I usually just pat them on top to stay.

This is great. I made it for an Italian theme dinner and all my friends loved it. Best to use two large eggs.

The taste of olive oil spoiled the overall taste of this bread. It left a greasy taste in your mouth. I would not recommend this receipe.

This bread (cake) is a lovely light color. Next time I will mix the pine nuts into the batter; since I had to bake about 10 mins. longer than suggested, the nuts on the top of the bread got too dark and also fell off when the bread was sliced.

I'm new at cooking and have been looking for some easy things that I could make. This bread is addictive! It's so moist! I didn't use nuts, or raisins and to my own dismay I forgot the lemon zest. This bread is great for snacks, but works very well with a greek salad.

I was having an off day and did everything you can do to mess up this bread - I forgot one of the ingredients and added it later, I dropped it when I pulled it out of the oven to check for doneness - and it was still terrific. I served it with afternoon tea and it was a big hit with my boyfriend. Given that it's pretty healthy but almost tastes like cake and I almost always have the ingredients lying around, I would definitely make it again.

I have read so much recently on the health benifits of olive oil that I am constantly on the lookout for desserts and sweets made with olive oil rather than butter or shortening. They're hard to find, so I was excited when I came across this one. I had high hopes that it would be good. It is. Actually, it's better than good, it's FABULOUS! My family loved it. This is one that I'll make over and over again.

I made the recipe for a snack, and subsituted walnuts for the pinenuts,and lemon juice for the grated peel. It was a wonderful tea type bread with good crumb.

This easy, delightful quick bread is really a cross between a not too sweet cake and a nut bread. It is great with a cup of coffee or tea, and equally good sliced for breakfast. I put the pine nuts into the batter along with the golden raisins, reserving a few nuts to sprinkle on top of the batter. The lightly lemon flavor with the sweet raisins and the piney flavor of the pine nuts was delightful! I have already made it several times, both for snacking and to put on a brunch buffet. Aside from the task of grating the lemon peel, it is very quick to stir up by hand or with the beater.
