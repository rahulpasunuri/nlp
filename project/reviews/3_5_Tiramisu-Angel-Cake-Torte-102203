Very easy and very good. Everyone raved about it. I knew to open the store bought angelfood cake and let it sit out to get just a little dryer and staler before cutting. I don't like Amaretto so I used a combination of Kahlula and Sabra. I used a dark chocolate bar with orange peel in it for my chocolate shavings. I used both almond and chocolate shavings on the sides and top of the cake. The people at the party I took it too thougt it a store bought cake. I was honored by this. I am taking it to work using orange infused coffee syrup instead of liquor. Don't want to get fired at work for having alcohol!

The only good thing about this cake is that it is very easy to make. The taste wasn't great. The texture of the angel food cake doesn't match the richness of the frosting. If I was to do it again, I would use regular white/yellow cake, and whip up extra cream to trim it with.

Like it very much, but not for those looking for something really sweet (the frosting is nice - but not sweet). Couldn't find ready-made angel food cake at the store - so made it from a mix. Hard to beat - making the cake from the mix is cheap & easy (so long as you factor in the time factor).

after reading all the reviews, i was excited to make this dish for christmas eve. thought it was so-so. liked frosting, but didn't like the angel food cake with it. should just have made a regular tiramisu. also, was i supposed frost the whole cake? looked funny without it so i did. presentation was good.

This was very easy and relatively fast to assemble. I made it for a large group and everyone loved it. I will deginately make this again at another dinner party.

This will become a standard. I made this for an office birthday party. I was planning an Italian themed meal and needed an easy dessert. I used a store bought angel food cake--which is not my usual style--and it worked great. I also used Kahlua with the amaretto because I had more of it. One of my staff has already put in her request to have this for her birthday next February--nearly a year away!

I made this for friends and it was delicious and very easy! Instead of angel food cake, I used Twinkies! Cut them in half lengthwise and layer in a loaf pan cut side/cream up. Instead of Amaretto, I used 1/2 & 1/2 strong espresso coffee with Sambuca Kaffe (espresso flavored Sambuca) as the Twinkies needed extra soaking. I also sprinkled Droste cocoa on top of the shaved chocolate for an extra punch! As a caterer, I am always looking for recipes that can scale for large crowds and you could certainly double or triple this one in a larger pan. Yummy!

Made this for a baby shower...wanted to avoid the ugly bakery cake complete with plastic baby. Incredible flavor! I used Kahlua instead of amaretto since I had it on hand. Also used a bakery angel cake..but it was so pretty and so delicious no one noticed. Garnished with fresh strawberries.

This sounded like an interesting recipe to make with an angel-food cake I baked to use up egg whites, but I wasn't expecing it to be as good as it was. Worth making "on purpose", even! I DID substitute Contreau for the Amaretto, which I didn't have on hand. Worked equally well.

Because of the previous reviews and my past experiences with angel food cake I made this cake the night before I planned to serve it and chilled it overnight. It cut beautifully and the favors meld together nicely. I also baked the angel food cake from scratch. I used a slightly more generous amount of Kahlua in place of the amarettto. I liked it better than a real tiramisu as it is lighter. Also it is less expensive to make. Cream cheese can be purchased from the supermarket with the other ingredients, while it takes a special trip to an Italian delicatessen or cheese store to find mascarpone. For me, the amount of filling in the recipe was just right. Definitely a keeper.

True, this cake has little in common with real tiramisu, but it is delicious, makes an impressive presentation, & is so easy. I made sponge layers, which worked splendidly. I can't help it: I'd feel guilty serving store-bought cake to guests!

Made this once for New Year's and then about a week later because my husband requested it for an office party. It is wonderful and easy, as everyone has said.

Easy and delicious! This is a great recipe for summer entertaining or when you're in a rush. Buying the angel food cake makes it easy. A fresh strawberry garnish adds a nice touch, too. Everyone who tried it, loved it and wanted the recipe.

This is an attractive and delicious dessert. I served it today for Easter dinner. I did not have the expresso but the frosting was still great.

This is a great dessert! Very impressive, but extremely easy to prepare. One suggestion, use a store purchased angel cake - easier to work with and cuts down the time. This is a winner!

I doctored this recipe slightly. I only added 1 TB of cocoa and omitted the espresso, but used all of the amaretto to keep it light. I served this with strawberries on the side and everybody loved it. Tasty, easy, and makes an impressive looking dish.

I made this for my adult daughter's birthday, knowing she had a different favorite angel cake recipe. But wanted to go with a more Italian theme. The whole family loved it! She can't decide which is her favorite anymore. Would definitely make this again. I don't recommend chocolate shavings on the top if you have candles to blow out though. We had chocolate all over the tablecloth. Quite funny however.

I soaked this with a syrup of espresso/kahlua/sugar, this is probably more traditional than using pure amaretto. I liked it very much and had no problem slicing it, I used a serrated knife and a light hand.

Loved this recipe -- quick and easy to make. I increased the frosting by 50% though, as the quantity noted was a little skimpy. I didn't use a store bought angel cake - I made one from a mix, which was much tastier. Here's a hint for cutting the cake ... use an electric knife - you will be able to cut the cake without having frosting oozing every which way!

This was heavenly! I think the next time I make it I'll substitute kuhlua. I found the icing a bit thin though,( The angel food cake was hard to cut without all the filling squishing out) so after we cut it for the first time, I cut it all up and put it in a bowl-like a trifle. Make sure it is cold and maybe you won't have as much trouble.
