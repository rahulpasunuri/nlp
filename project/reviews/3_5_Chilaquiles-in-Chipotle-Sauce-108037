Let the tortillas be stale, or leave the package out overnight. Then when you fry the pieces, they'll get chewy and won't absorb as much oil. And that's traditional.

I'm mexican and actually that is almost how my mother used to make chilaquiles.I added shredded chicken breast, next time I'm going to try fried eggs. My husband loved the sauce. Excellente dish ;)

Just some feedback for the cooks out there. I've sampled chilaquiles in many different states in Mexico and they vary widely. I've had chilaquiles with and without eggs, with red tomato sauce and others with green sauces, and some with chicken and even string cheese. Many different and delicous variations exist and they are all "authentic."

This recipes gives a nice, relatively quick but tasty sauce, which is very similar to a the chilaquiles made by a friend who is from Jalisco state. She makes hers with eggs and chorizo as well, so I think that chilaquiles is one of those dishes that varies according to region and what the cook has on hand. Her mother has made it for me in the past with salsa verde, eggs and chicken, so it really is a versatile dish. I am not Mexican though, so I wouldn't presume to say which is "traditional" or "authentic". If you want to add eggs, scramble some in a bowl (4-6, depending on how many people) and add to the skillet after the tortillas have been added to the sauce. Make sure the tortillas have soaked up most of the sauce--you want the pan a little dry so the eggs can cook, so maybe remove some of the excess sauce if it looks like too much. Then just stir until the eggs are sufficiently cooked. One of my favorite breakfasts!

Is it just me, but I don't see where there are eggs in this recipe?

AWESOME dish- I had it without the eggs, like the recipe says, and the next morning I served eggs over it for brunch. (The recipe for the chipotle sauce yields 7 cups, so I had leftover sauce to use for an easy brunch!) There's so much flavor in this dish- definitely a keeper! The only problem was that we couldn't stop eating it!

I also had this dish for breakfast while in mexico and was happy to have a food memory to recreate at home. Very tasy. (just to add my two cents the chilaquiles I had in Mexico had no eggs).

This is exactly why I love the constant comment section of this site! This is a great recipe. To recap some of the previous sentiments - the chipotle sauce is a different recipe. Click on "Chipotle Sauce" and you will get that recipe. TRADITIONAL Chilaquiles (you know, from Mexico, where they come from?) are not made with eggs, meat, or anything else. They are tortillas in sauce with some nice queso over the top of them. Thanks, epicurious, for posting a great recipe for chilaquiles. For everyone else out there who wants eggs, or cheese on these, cook it as it's written, and put them over the top. This ain't rocket science, people!

This is a great dish. I made the chipotle sauce the day before and put it in the fridge, and then it was simple to fry the tortillas, heat the sauce and assemble the dish. The only other thing I did differently was to puree the chipotle sauce with my immersion blender, rather than the big blender the recipe called for, which worked just fine. It's really delicious. You won't regret making it.

YUM!!! Just like the chilaquiles I had in Mexico City!! But I think it's a real shame that the prominent Mexican chef who contributed this recipe to Bon Appetite didn't check with reviewers on this site to find out that chilaquiles are supposed to have eggs in them. Actually, I find a lot of this on Epicurious. If only chefs would learn to listen to people who don't know anything about what they're writing about or who rate recipes without making them or completely change all the ingredients and then complain that the recipes don't work. Oh well.

The real Mexican chilaquiles are without eggs!! The chilaquiles must be very "picosos"!!! The fried tortilla whit eggs call "Migas con Huevo". And one more tihing, where is the chipotle, don't see it anywere??

Chilaquiles don't have eggs. San antonio is the home of Tex- Mex food. The pan fried tortillas with eggs are called migas. This dish is a a way to use up stale tortillas.

I'm glad I finally read the previous comments as I spent quite a while trying to figure out why the sauce would be called "chipotle sauce". Definately a confusing way to post the recipe

Great recipe for chilaquiles with out the eggs!!!

Well, I suppose if you like soggy chips this would be the recipe for you. When I think of CHILAQUILES there is usually eggs in the dish to make it a bit more substantial...the sauce was good but it was basically soggy chips with cream...sorry but I would not make it again.

I agree with Carla. I am also confused. In San Antonio restaurants, if it says chilaquiles it means a dish with fried torillas and egg. Is this not the same thing?

Just a note, if you don't want to fry the tortillas you can bake them until they are crispy. I do it all the time with regular chilaquiles, so I can't imagine that it won't go well with this recipe. Saludos!

I just realized that the "chipotle sauce" in the recipe above is a link to a recipe for chipotle sauce. However, I maintain that the writing of this recipe is not on par with your usual effort, and it is confusing. Maybe the link color could be more intense. Its underlining made me think it was a heading. Maybe recipes should be whole or complete as printed ... especially when, as in this case, the linked ingredient is the main feature.

To the reviewer in Chicago...the recipe for the chipotle sauce is a LINK. So, if you click on the word, it will take you to the recipe for the sauce and the rest will make sense and fall into place.

I was thrilled to find this receipe as I have just returned from Zijautanejo and had this every day for breakfast.....Even more thrilling it gives me chance to use the Los Chileros chipotles in my pantry.

I had something like this in Acapulco at the Hotel Las Brisas. I was excited to find this recipe. It took alittle time to prepare- frying tortillas is a bit messy but the effort was worth it- my family loved it. I added some shredded roast chicken. Great Mexican comfort food.
