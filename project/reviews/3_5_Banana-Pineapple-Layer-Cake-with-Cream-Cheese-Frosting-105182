Cake was pretty good, my family liked it, especially my little niece, I noticed a little hole in the side from her fork! Nice banana flavor, hardly any pineapple taste. I did not find the cake greasy at all, like some reviewers. Frosting is way too sweet and heavy with vanilla. Maybe next time I will use less vanilla and powder sugar, even though I cut back on the sugar by a cup this time.

The cake is vey moist, nice banana flavor, very little pineapple flavor. I did not find it greasy at all like some reviewers did. Frosting way too sweet and Icut back on the sugar, good thing, also I am not a big fan of vanilla, and this frosting is heavy with vanilla, maybe next time, I will cut back on that, too.

We liked this recipe, but didn't love it. The cake was very moist, but to us it tasted just like banana bread. The pineapple wasn't even detectable. Next time I'd up the pineapple and maybe add some more spices or coconut. The frosting was excellent, and I'd definitely make it again.

This recipe turned out fabulous, and my whole family loved it! We are a Latino family, and appreciate the fresh fruits included in this recipe. For a little variation, we omitted the cream cheese frosting. Instead, we layered the top of the cake with coconut and pecans and drizzled sweetened condensed milk directly over the cake in a zig-zag pattern, then refrigerated lightly for 1 hour. Served with fresh whipped cream on top with a slice of pineapple and fried plantain on the side. Ummm Mmmmm, it was gone-fast!!

I don't do much baking, so I wanted to find a fairly simple but delicious cake to make for my daughter's first birthday. This recipe is super easy, and drew raves at the party. Since I was going to feed the cake to my daughter, I left out the pecans, but that was my only variation. I wish I listened to the other reviewers and halved the frosting recipe, because it does make an excessive amount.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes and it worked just perfectly. The only substitution was a 1/2 c. coconut, 1/2c. nuts instead of all nuts. I too would probably cut down on the oil next time as they were a bit oily. The frosting was delicious! All in all they were a big hit!

6/21/08 I just made this cake. I doubled it and baked in a teflon turkey roater. I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 butter as per some said it was greasy. I also used 2 extra banana's. Baked 1.10 minutes at 350. The caked turned out perfect. I divided it into 2 cakes. One to freeze and one to bring to a potluck. Love the taste per I have been baking yeasted and quick breads for 20 yrs.

This was a great cake for my daughter's first birthday. She liked it so much I made cupcakes out of it since they would be easier to store. I thought the cake was a little oily, so I cut back on the oil and increased the pineapple. The result was even better than the original, even without the frosting.

I made this in a hurry for a summer picnic, packed it and placed it in my trunk--when I arrived at the party, I popped the trunk to reveal that the cake had basically exploded and crumbled to cakey chunks all over the container. Luckily, my family has a good sense of humor! Despite its hideous appearance, everyone devoured the cake, but I agree with other reviewers who thought it was too much like a banana bread. I used 1/ 2 a fresh pineapple and found the flavor almost indistinguishable. If I make it again I'll just make it in loaf form and forget about the slippery (but tasty) frosting.

I first made this cake when it was in the issue from Summer 2001. I loved it and my family and friends loved it. Then my lovely husband threw the issue away before I had a chance to add this to my recipe box. To my delight I found it online and am anxious to try it out again this summer. I love the recipe the way it is. The only thing I like to change from time to time is the cream cheese frosting. Sometimes I find it too sweet, so I substitute it for a whipped cream frosting, keeping it light and cool. It tastes delicious.

This recipe is AWESOME just the way it is written - a huge hit every single time I make it. It is moist & just delicious. I can expect recipe requests when I bring this to a party or picnic. I wouldn't change a thing.

Notes to suit my own taste, but there is nothing "wrong" with the recipe: Oil: use 1 stick butter, melted + 3/4 cup oil=== Sugar: reduce to 1 2/3 cup and add 1/3 cup molasses=== Pineapple: based on a 20-oz can, use 1/3 liquid & 2/3 fruit=== Flour: increase to 3 1/4 cup. Crumb was dense, but not too heavy. Came out easily from baking-sprayed pan=== leavening: used 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder instead of baking soda. Could have risen more, but was very moist and fruity.

Ok, so I made this with modifications suggested by other reviewers -- melted butter instead of oil. I also added 1 cup of desicated (unsweetened) coconut. 3 forks for flavor and also ease of making (I still prefer carrot cake, but this is a nice change). Next time I will use half oil and half butter, or all oil. All butter seems to make the refrigerated cake too stiff.

This is a family favorite for us, the standby cake that everyone loves. I get requests for this cake all the time and make it for every special occasion. Delicious, easy, and always a crowd pleaser.

Very very moist, but definitely could use more flavor. Should've put extra banana flavoring in. My bananas were so ripe that they melted (instead of chopped), so I added about 1/4 more flour and it was still very moist. I went half and half on the oil, adding 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup oil. For the frosting, I added 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut. I halfed the recipe for the frosting, but it wasn't enough! Will make again with added banana flavoring... Very easy to make. I mixed all dry ingredients the day before and made the cake in 5 minutes the next day. Blend the wet ingredients first together before adding to the dry! Tastes like a banana bread, great for breakfast too!

I looked for a banana cake recipe having no idea that the hummingbird cake I used to loved from Harry's Farmers Market in Atlanta was actally based on bananas! I looked at the comments and made my own edits - just used the toasted pecans on the frosting, and added tosted coconut to the batter instead. Used all the spice suggestions but I have to say I didn't get a lot of the subtle flavors... it's pretty much about the moist fruit flavors and the cream cheese frosting. Makes great cupcakes with a dollup of frosting on top... very satisfying, got loads of compliments and it's so damn easy!

I have made this cake several times and it is always a hit. I do double the amount of pineapple to bring out more of that flavor.

Brought the cake to a baby shower and everyone loved it. I thought it was good, but it tasted too much like bananas. I even reduced the amount of banans required by 1/2 and made up the difference with more pineapple. Next time I will just try it with just pineapple alone with just a hint of banana.

Well, I omitted the pecans which I realize is sacreligious to some, and improvised a filling/frosting. This recipe makes two round cakes. One we ate plain with no frosting - it is quite good, although the crust is a little tough - very banana-breadish ... would have liked more pineapple flavor. The second cake we cut in half and place both cut sides up. We sprinkled both cut surfaces with Bacardi select dark rum, maybe a quarter cup each. Then for the frosting, we started playing with what we had on hand. We melted 3/4 stick butter, 1 1/4 cups brown sugar and maybe a third of a cup of rum in a small saucepan. We heated it until the sugar dissolved and the butter melted. When cooled, I placed it in the bowl of my kitchen aid stand mixer with the whisk-type attachment and whisked it for a very long time until it started fluffing up a little. Then I added a tad more dark rum (2-3 T) and half a package of cream cheese (4 oz.) I whipped it some more until it was all incorporated and quite fluffy then added a cup of whipping cream. Whipped it again at which point it first turned to liquid and then eventually became mousse-like. Would have been happy to just put it in dessert dishes at that point, but filled and frosted the cake with it. The idea was that brown sugar and rum would compliment the pineapple and banana flavors and the cream cheese would complement it's carrot-cake-ishness. Oooh la la!

Mmmmmm! I made this as a bundt cake and it disappeared. I used 1/2 cup melted butter instead of 1 cup (!) of veg oil. It was so moist I can't imagine it with all that oil. I also added a Tbs or 2 of dark rum. I think it would be even better with fresh pineapple, which I will try next time with the frosting.

Delicious! Thanks to other reviews, would not make this again without including coriander, rum and toasted coconut in the batter. Baked in a tube pan, l hour 10 min. Didn't need the frosting.

Fabulous! I used fresh pineapple instead of canned. It took closer to an hour (not 30 minutes) to cook and turned out perfectly - just the right degree of moistness, sweetness and flavour. I used Tangy Chocolate Frosting (made with yoghurt) instead of the Cream Cheese Frosting and it was just a delicious combination. The cake was very high and substantial.

Rating: 3
A great start. I thought that the cake was just a bit dark and heavy. next time I would make three layers which would be thinner so that they could bake faster and without such a dark tough crust. But very yummy. I added slices of fresh banana between the layers and it was a big hit.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it always gets rave reveiws; however, after reading previous posts I modified it a bit to increase the pineapple flavor and lean it more toward a Hummingbird Cake. For the batter I used melted butter in place of the oil, I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 cup of unsweetened desiccated coconut. I split each layer to make four and between each layer put 1/2 cup of icing topped with 1/4 cup of pineapple preserves. The icing recipe makes so much that the added layers use up the excess. It looks pretty decorated with toasted coconut and pecans. I haven't tried with the rum yet but intend to the next time around.

I tried this recipe to use up some rapidly ripening bananas and the rest of a can of crushed pineapple. I cut the recipe down by 1/3 and baked it in my 7x11 pan (as a really small sheet cake). The cake came out just fine (texture is much like carrot cake), though I'd probably try fresh pineapple next time (the pineapple flavor wasn't really that evident). I changed the spices a bit -- used a mix of equal parts cinnamon and coriander, and a good pinch of mace. I didn't have the icing ingredients so I made a syrup with dark rum and macerated sliced strawberries in it.. drizzled the syrup over the cake slices and put the strawberries on the side. REALLY GOOD, and not too sweet (and it at least *seems* relatively healthy for a dessert ;-). I definitely recommend the coriander -- I used about a generous 1/4 tsp. This seems like a recipe that could stand up to variations and additions (toasted coconut, dried cherries or apricots). I will definitely make this as a layer cake with the cream cheese frosting sometime, using the cream cheese frosting recipe from the New Basics Cookbook -- I can't imagine a better recipe than that one.

This cake is amazing! I had some bananas that were getting too ripe and didn't feel like making banana bread and this recipe looked interesting. I was a little worried about the batter before I added the pineapple, as it looked similar to wet cookie dough, but the pineapple made it a thick rich batter. I also didn't add nuts to this cake. I brought the finished cake to work and it was polished off in under 5 minutes. This is a great, unique and beautiful cake that's easy to make and tasted incredible! I'm going to make this into cupcakes and bring more into work tomorrow by request! Enjoy!

This is a delicious recipe. I made it with 2 cups crushed canned peaches instead of bananas. For the frosting, I used 1/2 cup butter and added 6 tablespoons of the juice from the canned peaches. Next time I'll add some chopped fresh peaches to the frosting as well. Lightly frosted as recommended since the cake is so dense and rich.

Oh YUM YUM YUM!! I had thought that with the very heavy batter that it would not be as good as this turned out but it was just scrumptious. A very heavy cake that could, like others have said, stand just by itself. I frosted it and my husband and kids all dove in and finished every bite. I'll be taking the advice of a previous reviewer and using this as a "camping" cake as well.

Quite delicious, this. I omitted the pecans, as I really don't appreciate nuts in bready articles, but patted slivered almonds around the layers for a more polished presentation. Topped the top with wafer-thin strawbs cut on the bias, and frosted rather sparingingly (but used three layers) as the cake is rich as Rock-a-fella on its own. I can't imagine how decadent this would be if the layers were rum-soaked -- per the advice of other reviewers -- but I'm eager to find out if ever I make it for a less tee-totaling crowd.

I make this cake from an old recipe which calls for 3 layers and 1-1/2c oil. I tried this w/only 2 layers and 1-1/4c oil. Cake was very moist.Only problem, was it took longer to cook - center was still "wet" when I took it out after @41-42 min. Per others, I soaked layers w/pineapple rum. For frosting I used only 5TBL butter, it was plenty.

yummy-yummy! this was definitly a cake and not banana bread. i didn't have oil so i melted a cup of butter instead. i also used a small can of diced pineapple which i pureed with the juice. i also baked it in a bundt pan for 60 minutes and did without the icing since i didn't feel like going to the store to get cream cheese(even though cream cheese icing is my favorite!). my method would probably make some chefs crazy but i go for simplicity and i have yet to make an unsatisfactory dish...i use my trusty kitchen-aid and mix all the wet together including the bananas, then i add the dry ingredients all at once and mix until blended(don't overmix). easy-peasy and yummy-nummy!

After reading the other reviews, I was cautious to not make banana nut bread. So this is what I did to emphasize the pineapple: Macerate the pineapple in 3tbps of Meyer's Dark Rum. Add 1tbp of cardamom to the batter. Leave out the nuts in the cake batter. Imbibe the cake layers with watered-down Meyer's Rum (just want it to be very lightly rummed, not heavy). After frosting, cover the cake in toasted coconut and a few toasted nuts. With those changes, it actually tasted like a pineapple cake. :)

Although some reviewers found the cake too similar to banana bread, I thought it much moister (largely the work of the vegetable oil, I think), and definitely dessert-like. I was particularly thrilled because it was such a close approximation of the monkey cake I had enjoyed at Amy's Bread in New York -- and had been wanting to replicate ever since! The pineapple's definitely a basenote, here; if you want more flavor, why not follow the advice of one cook who reviewed a pineapple upside-down cake on this site, and try adding a little pineapple rum? I am sure the flavors would suit very well -- plain rum would probably be good, too. The frosting is very good (I add a little lemon juice to cream cheese frosting to cut the sweetness) . If you're eating this shortly after assembly, some sliced banana between the layers is a nice touch, as are finely chopped pecans, pressed against the cake's sides.

I doubled the cake recipe and made two layers in 9"x13" pans. We had a large crowd so this worked out well. The frosting was just about perfect even though there was more cake to cover.
