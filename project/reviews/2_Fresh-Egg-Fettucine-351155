Please note that this recipe is missing 2 cups flour in the ingredients list. This recipe calls for you to combine the flour and semolina, but no flour is listed in this recipe. It makes all the difference -- this recipe is missing 1/2 of the flour! My source for this correction is the Gourmet Italian cookbook (ISBN 978-0-547-84368-1).

I too noticed the discrepancy in the recipe but since I didn't have a copy of the original on hand I went with just straight semolina flour. I used a whole pound of semolina and then kneaded the dough with regular all-purpose. The dough was stiff. I let the dough rest for an hour; it softened up nicely, and then proceeded to work with the pasta machine. It turned out great and my guests loved it. I turned the cooked pasta into a classic Fettuccine Alfredo, which disappeared very fast, and was very good. I will be making this recipe again.

The recipe in the magazine does say 2 cups of each flour. Epicurious copied it incorrectly. Still, it was a difficult pasta recipe. The dough was way too dry with only 5 eggs. I added another egg and still had to add a little water and oil to the dough just to get it to come together. Eventually, I got a dough that would work, but it took time. Next time I will not use a recipe and just kind of wing it.

This recipe as others have noted is incorrectly written. However, if you use a blend of seminola and regular flour to make the two cups you can make this recipe work. As instructed by others make a mound of flour on the counter or board. Make a well and add eggs (2-3 usually works) mixing the flour (with your hands) gradually into the egg mixture. Get a nice wet dough going and keep adding the flour until you get a nice mass of flour and egg mixture. Knead this a little bit until incorporated. Cut off chunks of this mixture and use your pasta machine rollers to do the work you should be able to proceed as the recipe instructs. If by chance you end up with dough too stiff to work with as you go, a little sprinkle of water will help to loosen it up. My very good Italian friend has helped me to make very fine pasta this way. Hope this clears things up a little

I've seen a variation on this recipe that called for 2c flour and 2c semolina. Unfortunately, it didn't work at all; I could not get the dough to come together into a non-crumbly, elastic dough.

"...combine the semolina and the flour..." Er, per the ingredient list the semolina is the flour. I learned from Mario Batali a recipe scaling called "eggs of pasta". Place a pile of semolina on a wooden work surface, make a well in the center, and crack whole eggs into the well. (Roughly, 1 egg of pasta will feed 1 person with leftovers; 3 eggs of pasta will feed 4.) Start the eggs with a fork, incorporating the semolina a bit at a time till you have a thick batter or loose dough, then use your hands to work the flour in, a little at a time until you have a firm dough. When it becomes non-sticky, scrape the excess flour aside and continue to knead. There should be plenty of semolina left on the bench--I sift it and store it. Rest dough in the cooler for at least 30 minutes to let the flour (yes, semolina flour) absorb the eggs.

this recipe is incomplete, don't even bother & stop rating it with 3/4 forks!!

Sorry, but this isn't up to epicurious.com standards...or Gourmet's...and any dried pasta will last more than 12 hours, properly dried. There is NO rush to add recipes, be accurate or you will lose all of us!

This sounded like something I would want to try but..... It tells how much semolina but doesn't tell you how much flour to use.

Why is it that the ingredient list specifies only semolina flour and eggs, while the instructions ask to combine flour and semolina flour? How much flour?

Directions call for mixing flour and semolina but flour is not listed as an ingredient!!! how about proofreading this stuff so we don't waste our time.

Does anyone know how much flour to use? I see the 2 cups of semolina flour but the Marke Dough: says Combine flour and semolina. Thank You

This recipe is incomplete - it says to mix flour and semolina, but only lists the semolina in the ingredients - how much flour are you supposed to use?

The description says both flour and semolina...but the ingredient list only includes semolina. Error somewhere?

The ingredients listed are not correct. In addition to the 2 cps semolina flour, there is also 2cps regular non-bleached flour. We thought the pasta tasted great, but as a first-time pasta maker, I think the timing of the instructions was off. If the pasta dries more than 15 minutes, it is too hard. And yet, it is next to impossible to roll out all the pasta in 15 minutes. So instead, we rolled out some and let it dry, and cut it into fettucine before we rolled out all of it.
