This flan was creamy and delicious. My variation was that I used 3 cinnamon sticks instead of the ground cinnamon, which infused the milk with great flavor and avoided clumping problems. I also doubled the amount of caramel - 1/2 cup sugar and 3 T. water.

This dessert was exquisite. If you want a healthy flan this dessert is fantastic. I used skim milk instead of lowfat milk and it was still delish.

I give this four stars because it is extremely good for something that is also kind of healthy. I used cinnamon extract to avoid the clumping other reviewers complained of.

I am always searching for "healthful" recipes...lowfat, and often gluten-free for someone with a special diet. This turned out beautifully - didn't have the problem some other reviewers had with the cinnamon clumping when whisked into the milk. I did bake a bit longer, as I wanted a firmer custard, and served it with sauteed apples. Very good!

As with the Cook from Nashville, I had a hard time getting the cinnamon and milk to combine well. While I didn't have a bitter crust, it was definitely not appealing to look at, but the taste more than made up for its appearance.

REMEMBER! This is a low fat recipe! That said, I thought this dessert was delightful. I experimented for Thanksgiving dinner, it was a hit. Because of heart disease/high cholesterol/strict diet for nearly my entire family, I took it one step further and used egg substitute. It was fine. Didn't have problems with the cinnamon like one other reviewer. Highly recommend. Will make again and again. Beautiful presentation and tasty. Great for company, too. The best part? Make it ahead of time!

This was really good, but next time I'm thinking twice about the cinnamon. Apparently, cinnamon doesn't like to mix too well in liquid, so it ended up making a crusty formation on the bottom of the flan. It was very tasty, but something about a bitter cinnamon crust was not what I had in mind.

I thought that this recipe was great, but I made a small modification. I thought that there was too little caramel so I used 1 cp. Sugar and 1/3 cp. water. And instead of the 4 - 3/4 cp. dishes I made 6 - 1/2 cp. ones. Everyone loved it!

We all loved this dish!. My wife says it could have been a touch more firm but I was too busy eating seconds to pay much attention. I made these the day before and when I placed the cups upside down on the plate and looked at how beautiful they were, I knew I had a winner!
