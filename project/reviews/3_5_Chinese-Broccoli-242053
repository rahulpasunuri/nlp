Using butter in Chinese vegetables may not be traditional, but it's delicious! I used broccolini and we loved it.

Also its not soy sauce that we use its hoisin sauce.

You must not be chinese because chinese people do not use butter in their food.

Made this exactly as directed, doubling the sauce element. My boyfriend actually said it tasted as if it were made in a real Chinese restaurant. In the future, I'll probably not mess with Chinese broccoli and opt for broccolini instead. Though truth be told, this sauce will work with just about anything.

This is a fantastic recipe! So simple and fast. The ingredients go great together- butter, soy sauce, five spice powder. The peanuts on top add crunch and a burst of salt. WOW!

This is delicious! I made it exactly as directed, minus then nuts. The sauce is simple and outstanding.

So where's your recipe, smarty pants from IN? Not bad but the rappini with the five spice powder were a bit too strong for our taste. Think I will stick with a more traditional garlic, salt & pepper preparation.

Did anybody just make THIS DAMN RECIPE???? These reviews are useless, for those of us who just want to make the recipe as presented!

I really liked this recipe. I used regular broccoli and couldn't find Chinese five-spice powder, so I looked up some of the spices in it and made up my own. I added a little bit of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and coriander. Altogether it added up to about 1/2 a teaspoon. It turned out really well.

This was a great weeknight recipe & very quick. I ran out of butter, so I used 2 teaspoons of lowfat butter spread (the horror! I know) & 4 teaspoons of olive oil instead. I also cut back on the peanuts a little bit. I felt that the 5-spice powder was too strong & I normally like stronger/ethnic tastes(although my husband liked it). This is why I took away a fork. The texture was like the Chinese broccoli you get in a dim sum restaurant, which I love. Next time, I will probably cut back on the butter a bit & use garlic powder instead of 5 spice. If youre watching your cholesterol, I honestly dont think the type of oil matters  the olive oil worked great. Would absolutely make again & add to my "veggie repertoire."
