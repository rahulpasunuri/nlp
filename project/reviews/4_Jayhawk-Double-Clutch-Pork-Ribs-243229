Doubled the recipe, used some steak seasoning mix from the spice drawer in addition to the other spices, and didn't add honey at the end. Absolutely delish!

Absolutely delicious! I used to steam my ribs, stovetop, for a couple of hours to tenderize; however, this recipe is much better and the flavor is great!

This is the same way I have done ribs for years and family and friends always want ribs when they come for a barbeque. The only difference is that I use a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce and about 1/4 cup of good beer instead of water, and I include a coarsely diced onion, a bell pepper and a couple of chopped cloves of garlic inside the foil to season the meat. The rest of the beer goes into the cook.
