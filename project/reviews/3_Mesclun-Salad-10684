I love a simple salad like this. One can also substitute balsamic vinegar. When the greens are fabulous, you don't necessarily need other ingredients. A bit of fresh herb, like oregano or thyme adds a nice touch too. Quality e.v. olive oil is a must here, when the salad is this simple, the flavor of the oil is the star of the show.
