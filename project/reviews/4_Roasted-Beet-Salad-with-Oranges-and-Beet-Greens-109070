I opted to modify the recipe by using 1/2 red and 1/2 golden beets. I kept them in separate containers until I was ready to serve 2 days later. Since my greens didn't look so good I used baby spinach. I took dressing from the marinated beets and tossed it on the uncooked baby spinach then arranged it on the bottom of my platter arranged half the red beets on one side of the platter and golden's on the other side. You would have thought I was a gourmet cook the way the group responded. This is a keeper!

Very tasty healthy beet salad. Like everyone else I love being able to use the whole beet. I scaled the olive oil back to just about 2 tablespoons and it is still very delicious and even lighter on the waist.

A fast, tasty meal that is healthy to boot.

Made this yesterday exactly as specified and it got three thumbs up. The beets in our garden are coming in, so we'll be using this recipe again soon.

I make this recipe every summer at least 3 or 4 times! It's FANTASTIC! When the beets are in the peak of growing season, it is fresh, delicious and even people who turn up their noses at beets seem to love it! A real winner and so easy!

this is a perfect summer salad! made it exactly as the recipe called for to rave reviews. I think it will be in heavy rotation this summer.

Refreshing! I did not roast the beet (too little time) and just made the salad with the tops. Very good and I did not even think (or need) to add salt and pepper. Beet greens were from my garden so it was especially nice to go from harvest to the table in an hour!

Beautiful, healthful salad! I topped mine with crumbled goat cheese and sunflower seeds, and added a bit of fresh baby spinach. The best part about this recipe is that it used the ENTIRE beet. Excellent recipe to serve to those who have convinced themselves that they don't like beets!

I've made this twice now, and it is excellent. Great way to use whole beets. I do the onions and garlic a little different, I thinly slice them and then let sit with the vinegar (I used white wine vinegar) for 20 min or so, then finish salad. If you have some extra greens on hand the salad can handle more than just the beet greens.

Delicious with CSA farm beets & oranges. Quick beet roasting tip: slice beets into 8 wedges first, toss with a little olive oil, put on cookie sheet covered with foil, and roast only 30 minutes. Cool beets on foil in freezer for 5 minutes. Now it's a weeknight dinner.

Beautiful Color! Instead of Wine vinigar, I used Pomegranate Balsamic. Delicious!

This salad is very showy. I added the juice from the segmented oranges and a bit of sugar. Next time, I'll serve indiviually on Boston lettuce leaves for even more dramatic color contrast!

Made as directed the first go around. The beets and dressing were lovely. The onions, even though sliced thin, had quite a bite. Next time, I will saute them in a bit of butter and only use half the amount.

I added a little honey to the dressing to balance the vinegar, other than that it was wonderful!

So delicious! Sometimes I substitute a portion of the vinegar and oil with flavored ones (Tangerine oil, Calamansi vinegar, both from Vom Fass) but the salad is superb just as written. I also might add a touch of sugar if a sweeter salad is desired. We love this recipe!

This has become a favorite dish. We love the big, bold flavors of the vinegary dressing, beets, and oranges. Roasting and cooling the beets makes the recipe time-consuming, or else we'd probably make it every week. I agree with others who add additional greens to amp up the beet & orange-to-green ratio. Any quick-cooking green works well.

I loved this recipe, the combination of oranges, beets and onions is wonderful. I used fresh spinach to add more greens to the mix and it worked very well. Would definitely make it again.

KEEPER !! Used all the ingredients 'but' didn't add the greens and I only had a regular yellow onion on hand instead of a sweet onion which are very strong} so I only used a about 2 T 'minced' onion. I added a little extra oil to tone down the vinegar & oil mixture which I thought was too vinegary. I loved the orange zest so I added 1/2 tsp. extra! I agree with the other reviewer who said the salad could have used an extra orange, next time I think I'll add one. {I also added the excess juice that I could squeeze out of the membranes after I cut the orange segments out of them}. *** Dr. OZ said BEETS are natures Botox thats an added bonus!

I don't know.... maybe I just hate beets! This "salad" was awful. I made it as per recipe, though I sauteed the greens with the onion and garlic. Unless this is a practical joke or something, I don't know how this recipe got all 4 star reviews. I want my oranges back!

I LOVE beets. I am always looking for new ways to enjoy them. This was wonderful, beautiful and healthy! Made with both golden and red beets for an even prettier plate. The guests I served this to actually asked me to make it for them again the next time they came for dinner.

So I HATE beets...but wanted to make them for my 5-yr old son to enjoy. I was SHOCKED that I actually enjoyed this dish. Some tips: -Be sure to have enough oranges (I could probably have added another orange). Tastes best when your forks has one piece of each (onion, beet, orange, greens). -To prevent dirty dishes, I let the beet cool in the foil, which I opened to release the heat/steam. I then placed a paper towel on the cutting board, and the foil on top of the paper towel. This prevented the beet juice from running onto the counter/cutting board. Also, I used heavy duty foil. After peeling and cuting, I just rolled up the foil & paper towel and tossed. -Oil is lighter than vinegar, I used a large measuring cup, poured in teh 1/4 cup oil first, then into the same cup added the 1/3 cup vinegar. The vinegar displaced the oil, sinking to the bottom, so was able to easily measure. I added the minced garlic and orange zest and wisked in the measuring cup. I definitely think it would be good to let this marinate...perhpas overnight. Overall, super easy and a good, healthy dish that even my 5-yr old enjoyed!

The color, texture, and flavor were great. I sauteed the beet greens in olive oil with crushed red pepper, garlic, and chopped onions. Garnished with roasted pecans and Feta cheese.

Really enjoyed this salad. Left out the greens, but otherwise followed the recipe. My husband, who thinks beets taste "like dirt," also raved about this salad. Easy, healthy and I'll definitely make it again.

Very good @ my Polish inspired Christmas get together [Fresh Polish sausage, sauerkraut/caraway seed, mashed Yukon Gold/Turnip, and Polish Rye]and these beets rounded out a great earthy Winter meal. Everyone LOVED the flavor combination, even my non-veggie loving hubby. The greens didn't look too fresh so I left them out, but otherwise didn't change anything else. Nice and sweet using the roasting method. Will make again.

I made this last night with 2 small subs - I didn't use the beet greens & I used Spring Onion greens instead of sweet onion wedges. Hubby & I both loved it. We eat alot of beets, so this is going to be a staple in our house.

I never would have made this on my own, but a friend brought it to a picnic and now I am HOOKED! I am so glad to have finally found a reason to incorporate beets into my culinary repertoire.

I often make this recipe without the greens and it is delicious. Especially if you add bacon and crumbled cheese (feta, goat, blue...). To make this in the summer without heating up the whole kitchen, I simmer diced cubes of beets in a pan for about 15 min, then carmelize them with some onion. This time around I tried them with the greens (mine usually wilt before I get to them). Not sure that the greens were worth it -- they have a very overpowering vegetal taste, like a strong chard flavor. I think you'd have to be one who really loves dark green leafy greens to appreciate it. Next time around I'll just stick to the usual.

I made this with fresh beets from the garden. I forgot to pick up a sweet onion so I used very thinly sliced yellow onion and I added soft goat cheese. It was awesome!!!! Everyone loved it. I never know beet greens were so good.

My husband thought this salad looked weird, but then he asked me to fix it again! The onion needs to be sliced paper thin. I thought the dressing was pedestrian. The concept of the salad is good, not brilliant. But hey, beets never win anything. (Quoted from a frequent cooking contest winner interviewed in the New York Times.)

Roasted beets were far from what I knew of beets, having only experienced the pickled kind. This was good and a nice change as far as salad goes. The only drawback was that my grocery didn't carry beets with the greens, which was disappointing.

Excellent salad! I didn't have many greens to salvage but the ones that made it added a lot. I also didn't have sweet onion or red wine vinegar. I used a regular yellow onion and balsamic vinegar. Delicious. I can't image how good this salad would be with goat cheese!! (Also didn't section the orange slices - who does that? hah!)

This recipe took quite a bit of work and definitely dirtied a lot of dishes but it was delicious. I did saute the onions and garlic. We can't afford good olive oil and wine vinegars so I'm weary of dressings but it still came out great. I just let the salad marinate in the dressing for about 20 minutes then I drained the dressing and let the salad sit for the rest of the time. The citrus is a surprising complement to the beets.

Excellent! Loved that you used the greens. I might try roasting or sauteing the garlic next time to cut down on the raw garlic flavor.

Didn't really make this a salad as the beet greens were to wilted by the time I got around to make this. I sauteed the onions as I am not into raw and I only cooked the beets for an hour (as they were smaller). Next time: using the greens and better quality red wine vinegar.

Yeah this is good stuff. I can get my kids to eat this with smaller amts of garlic and onion, but really healthful stuff!

So Good! the beet greens are key. I had always thrown them out when roasting beets....I never realized how delicious they could be. I used a very good balsamic vinegar instead. Wonderful! I also used other greens to used with more beets...good but not as good as the beet greens.

Good for a change up from our basic greens salad. I carmelized the onions to cut any harsh onion-y taste and added sliced almonds we had on hand for a crunchy texture. Dressing was surprising ly good with the combo of orange peel and garlic. We used orange champagne vinegar (trader joe's) instead of red wine vinegar and it was great! Will add some goat cheese next time to kick the flavor up a bit.

Made a few modifications. I didn't have onions or garlic. Used pomegranate vinagarette. I love how the beet greens were soft from boiling. The citrus flavors are a nice complement to the beets. I used satsuma mandarin oranges which are great because they are small and have a rich flavor and don't have to be peeled. I'm thinking the dressing could be a nice marinade for a light white fish like halibut, or sea bass. I'm soaking some beets overnight in the dressing and I am going to use it as a fish marinade tomorrow.

Lots has been said here. I'm new to cooking beets, and always disliked them unless on the menu in an excellent restaurant. This recipe, for something so simple, really gave excellent results for the quality of roasted beets and taste of the greens (Oh, I'm new to cooking greens, too).

I got some beautiful beets from the farmers market. I carmelized the onion with some fresh orange juice and added those to the roasted sliced beets & cooked greens. I think cheese or nuts might be a nice addition, perhaps pine nuts?

this is an exceptionally tasty, very easy-to- make recipe. i used balsamic vinegar instead of red-wine (it was all i had), and this added a nice sweet tang that went well with the oranges.

Worth the four forks because of its ease and versatility. I also omitted the onion. Added a little orange juice to the dressing, as I didn't have orange peel. The dressing had quite a kick to it at first taste, so I added a little aged balsamic to sweeten it up, but it was still quite punchy. However, my concerns were laid to rest after the salad had finished resting. WOW! The strong flavors mellowed out, the subtle flavors were brought out, and the world seemed in harmony as I ate. Even my beet-hating husband wanted more. I recommend gold beets, as they have the sweetest flavor. I'm trying this again right now with even more alterations: pre-peeling and cubing the beets, tossed in olive oil, sea salt, a little rosemary and thyme, and roasting before adding. Should be great!

I'm rating this a 4 because my shortcut version was a fabulous and easy 3. The secret is to get the beets with the best greens. I bought baby purple beets from the Farmer's Market that had the best greens I have ever tasted. Good greens really makes a difference. Also, I used small California Clematines which are in season now and have very thin membranes and could just be thrown in as is, Since I am not a fan of sectioning fruit, I think I would just use canned mandarin oranges in a pinch. I skipped the onion, but think I would roast it with the beets if I use one next time. Also, I used a left over balamic reduction sauce with just balsamic and orange juice. Although I skipped the garlic, I would add it next time (this is a great use for the garlic spray that is available at speciality stores). What a beautiful, healthy and delicious use for beets!

I HATE BEETS. I got some in a box of organic produce, so I made this for a luncheon for my guests. I forced myself to try it and it was DELICIOUS, and another confirmed beet hater at the luncheon liked them as well. I even ate all the leftover beet salad the next day! It will keep for two days and the marinade really soaks in - esp the garlic.

This result is not worth the time involved to prepare it. The greens were bitter and tough, the combination was not that tasty. I love beets, however, next time I'll just roast them and serve them as is. However, I may use the dressing for other salads.

This was great even though I took some short-cuts: microwaving beets works fine: wrap each in plastic, about 20 mins. Also, I didn't have sweet onions so I soaked the thinly sliced white onions in ice water for 1/2 an hour to moderate their flavor. I was even out of garlic and used powder!

Wearing rubber gloves, I peel and cut the beets before roasting. Put all the beets in a double layer of foil, seal tightly, put in pan and roast. One hour is usually long enough. This is a wonderful salad.
