The polenta part of the recipe was very good, but the the marinade for the shrimp (which I made exactly as described in the recipe) tasted like catsup - If I were to try this again, I'd marinate the shrimp in a red chili sauce or perhaps something soy-based. The tomato paste made it really awful.

I made only the shrimp since I had extra large shrimp in the freezer. I don't know what I did wrong but the sauce as provided in the recipe was not good enough. I will not make this again and will delete it from my recipe box. I ended up adding cayenne pepper to be able to make it taste better, but it wasn't delicious so NO for me.

Huge hit with our family, everyone really loved it! A few variations, I grilled the shrimp, and used dried pomegranate seeds because I couldn't find currants. Really flavorful, definitely a hit!!

very different but very good. I don't think the feta adds anything

This was fantastic...you'll need to season to taste and add hot sauce (Tapatio). I used precooked Polenta and crumbled it into the corn mixture skipping the cook in boiling water part. I'm very much a novice and I'm not sure about the whole Polenta thing. Fast & easy impresive dish!

My boyfriend LOVED the marinade although I'd double the amount of hot sauce (or use a stronger brand or both) for myself. I skipped the polenta and served it over couscous with steamed fresh peas on the side for a very fast dinner.

Not as good as I thought it would be. Will not make again.

I know how to cook and this was just ok. I did a 1 1/2lb of shrimp adn kept the ingrdients the same ok. Probably wouldn't do again guranteed. But ok bland and I spiced it up! Not worth the shopping I did for all the fine ingredients.

one of the better polenta recipes I've had. the fresh corn is definitely a nice touch. The prawn marinade is a little bit over powering in my opinion but I don't dislike it either.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.... I did use 2 teaspoons of Sambal Oelek --ground fresh chili paste--instead of the hot sauce and garlic powder....it gave it a nice "kick." The marinade/sauce was sweet but all three components worked nicely together.

Yuck.

This recipe was very odd... The polenta was excellent - would definitely make that again without changing a thing. The shrimp, however, was another story. Honestly, they tasted like shrimp in ketchup. I like the idea of this recipe and will modify the shrimp sauce so that we can try this again and see if we get better results.

I used a couple of garlic cloves instead of the powder & added some onion to the polenta. I thought it was very good but my husband absolutely loved it. He raved on & on about how good it was and he has a pretty traditional palate. This recipe has definitely earned a spot in my recipe repertoire!

I found this dish to be very tasty and satisfying. It`s a different combination but it works.

I had to make a number of substitutions due to availability, but nonetheless, it was fantastic. Used stone-ground yellow grits, cooked shrimp, canned corn and asiago cheese. All 3 of us raved about this.

When I first looked at the recipe, I thought it sounded a little strange. After making it, however, it is definitely one I will use over and over. The mix of flavors really works well together, creating a flavorful and delicious dish. The colors and the contrast of textures makes it visually appealing. It is a dish I could make for just us or for a large dinner party. I really enjoyed it and would absolutely recommend it to other people.

I have made this recipe from the book itself and it is AMAZING. Really dramatic looking and impressed everyone. And it's easy--most of the work is in the polenta, which you can cheat and use the precooked. Thought that a good summer variation to try is make it with that big, thick Israeli couscous mixed with scallions.

Caveat. Am planning on making this tomorrow because the prawn marinade sounded interesting. I already make a simple shrimp with cheddar grits which I make with coarse ground corn mean (polenta) without the frou frou that was in this polenta recipe (mine is a soft polenta which is more typical of grits anyway). Looking forward to the flavors meld.

This recipe was really strange...my husband called it schizophrenic. It sounded interesting but did not work at all. It really should be two separate recipes, as the shrimp don't go at all with the polenta. That said, it does have some potential split up! The shrimp marinade was tasty--it would go well perhaps with plain polenta, southern- style greens and black-eyed peas. Also, 10 minutes in the oven was too long for shrimp--mine came out tough-- I would cook them for less time or just grill and baste with the leftover marinade. The polenta (minus the honey--that was just weird--it tasted like mexican corn cake) would have been fine with just the currants, feta, capers and parsley, and maybe a simple lemon shrimp preparation--kind of Sicilian? The hot sauce with currants, capers, etc. was just plain gross--think about it! Those are my suggestions for those wishing to try this recipe, as I probably won't try this again since I risk my husband throwing it at me!

Original and very, very tasty! Will also try with savoury rice next time.
