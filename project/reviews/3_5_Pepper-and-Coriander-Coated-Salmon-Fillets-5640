One of my favourites! Such a complex flavour combo, especially with the garnish. Super easy, too.

I love this recipe. How can it not be flavorful with crushed coriander & pepper? The orange & parsley combination is essential. Very easy & quick. Also easy to make for just one person.

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT FORGET THE ORANGE. YOU CAN MAKE THIS AHEAD OF TIME AND JUST REHEAT AND TOP WITH THE PARSLEY AND ORANGE BEFORE SERVING. I HAVE FRIED UP THE SALMON IN THE MORNING AND JUST REHEAT IN THE MICROWAVE ON MEDIUM SETTING. I SERVE IT ATOP ARUGALA AND HALVED CHERRY TOMATOES TOSSED WITH OLIVE OIL, S&P, AND A BAQUETTE. THE ONLY OTHER SALMON RECIPE I'VE FOUND THAT EQUALS THIS IS "SALMON WITH FENNEL AND PERNOD". ALSO FROM THIS SITE.

This is one of the few salmon recipes that I make again and again. Normally, I detest left over salmon, but this still taste good the next day. The topping is a must- especially the orange.

We were shocked how flavorless this recipe was. It looked nice and had a crunchy crust but flavor was sorely lacking.

With all the salmon recipes out there, it's rare for me to come back to one ... but this one has found a permanent place in my recipe box. Love the hardened, spiced sugar crust on the fish. I even fed it to my in-laws, who are suspicious of fish; they were immediate converts.

This dish is a staple at our house. Quick, easy to make. We like it without the parsley.

This was OK if you are not a fish fanatic. I would serve it to company only if I am trying to hide the natural flavour of the salmon. In other words - OK but not a keeper.

We eat a lot of salmon. The world is full of wonderful ways to prepare it. This isn't one of them.

I thought that this was such an unusual and delicious way to prepare salmon that, when I ran out of whole coriander seeds (and was unable to find them in the supermarkets), I traveled many miles to buy the whole coriander at an East Indian specialty store. I will make this salmon dish again and again. Well worth a try; we loved it.

Not worth making again...there are so many better ways to prepare salmon. The spices took away from rather than enhanced the fish.

I may not have done this correctly, but the crust was more of a variably placed hard candy. I envisioned it to be consistent, almost like breading. I think I'll look for other recipes.

This is an easy-to-make recipe that is very good and impressive. The garnish and coating can be prepared ahead of time so all that's left is cooking the salmon. Don't forget the garnish though because it really adds a nice flavor to the coated fish.

This is one of my all-time favorites. Made it for a dinner party once and everyone wanted the recipe. It's one of those dishes I crave quite often and it's very easy to make.

A favorite in my recipe book! I've substituted the orange peel [which can be a bit tedious] with a sprinkle of Grand Marnier atop each filet just prior to serving. This entree is often requested by my friends and family. I treat myself often and prepare it as a lovely dish for one!

I loved the pepper and corriander crust. I didn't have any parsley OR orange, so used basil and lemon AND instead of pouring over, added to the skillet with the fish. Added a shot of Canadian Whiskey and then served fish with pan drippings. It was great!

This is delicious and has hints of the Pacific Rim. I substituted cilantro for the parsley(because I was out of parsley). The cilantro and orange were a great combination.
