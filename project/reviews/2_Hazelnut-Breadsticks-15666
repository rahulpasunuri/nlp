There are so many other better recipes for breadsticks. This sounds so tasty but the result is bland!

This recipe has been a favorite of mine ever since they first published it in the Nov 1998 issue. It's become somewhat of a tradition (two years so far)! I highly recommend it, if you've got the time.

Dough was too thick to mold. Thus they were "drysticks"

If you make this see also the recipe "TO TOAST AND SKIN HAZELNUTS". It seems like a lot of work for relatively modestly good breadsticks.
