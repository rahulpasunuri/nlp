Absolutely our favorite tomato-based chili recipe. We use less beef, making up the balance with beans, only to make it a bit healthier. We use only black beans. We sometimes mash a little of them for some extra body, and we add more jalapenos -- but we like things spicy. We've been making this for years and it is fabulous.

Since I have declared my own chili recipe to be the best, I decided I had to try a few other recipes just to make sure I was right ha! The three forks is mainly for my husband, who really did like this chili. I wasn't overly impressed. It was definitely better after sitting for a day, but I still found it lacking something...it had no depth. I added no extra ingredients or made any alterations of my own...I didn't feel I could rate the recipe properly if I hadn't have followed it. The raisins and olives made an interesting addition...especially the second day when the raisins had lost some of their sweetness and added an intriguing plump little 'pop' to the texture. It was good, but I will stick to my own recipe in the future.

This Chili was OK. Mine got WAY too thick. We like our chili a little soupy and really spicey. So I added more tomatoes and more liquid, plus tons more chilies. I liked the rasins and the olives but think in future I'll be sticking to my own chili recipe.

If I could give a 2.5 fork rating, I would. Overall, it was pretty good. I'd initially planned not to include the raisins and the olives, but I ended up adding the raisins when I tasted the almost-finished chili and decided it really needed something else. The raisins helped a lot to my surprise. By the time I needed to add the beans, the mixture was still too thin for my taste (I hadn't added any extra liquid), so I mashed half the beans to help thicken the chili. I substituted a 12oz. beer for 12oz. of the water, which I thought was a fabulous idea from a previous review. I can't say that this chili is out-of-this-world good, but I'm new to eating beef after 25 years of vegetarianism, so I may have just expected something far better than this recipe delivered.

I omitted the raisins due to family protest and it really turned out yummy. Had a chili "bar" set up with grated cheese, diced red onions, scallions, jalapeno and sour cream. The base was so tasty by itself but everyone added their own extras. The family really liked it.

I made this last weekend for Superbowl - it got raves from everyone and people went back for seconds and thirds. Of course, I changed a couple of things - added a bottle of beer instead of the water and extra cayenne. I didn't find it all that spicy as it was. I also omitted the raisins and olives (my husband hates olives & I'm not really a fan of raisins). I also added more beans, black and kidney. Served it with the lime cream found on here and a cornbread recipe I've got - delicious! I highly recommend this chili. I'll never use ground beef again. The meat was so tender...

The flavor was really good. If I were to make it again I'd chop the raisins and leave out the olives - they weren't terrible but didn't add a lot for me. I think it would be good as a filling for burritos.

Very very good recipe for chili. The raisins, olive and spices give it a nice flavor and the jalapeno pepper gives it a gives it a kick. Great on a cold winter night. Try it!

I've made this twice. We love it. It makes lots of leftovers that are delicious later in the week.

The raisins and jalapenos are great together! I added grated cheddar and sour cream to each bowl. This is an excellent recipe.

This is the best chili I've ever tasted! It's become one of our favorite recipes -- we make it in bulk and freeze. It's great reheated. It is a little labor-intensive -- but well worth it.

Delicious. Best to add the Jalapenos at the very end in round slices for a real kick. Also looks great when served with red and green jalapenos.

I served this recipe along with a Cheddar Corn Chowder, side by side in the same bowl and got rave reviews. This chili was spicy, but with a sweetness from the cinnamon and raisins. Add the smoothness of the Cheddar Corn Chowder (recipe from The Barefoot Contessa by Ina Garten)alongside, and I had people going for seconds and thirds! I served it with a green salad and the Spicy Roasted Red Pepper and Cheese Corn Bread. It was fantastic!

I just couldn't make the same-ole-chili recipe again for the Super Bowl. Got a couple of funny looks when I said this contained raisins and green olives. No complaints come halftime, however. Will definitely save and prepare again -- nice change from the typical and complex flavors. (Not to mention it was really easy!)

I have been making this chili since it first appeared in '92. It is always a hit. Sometimes I omit the raisins and olives.

We thought this was an excellent chili. It had enough kick and a great hispanic flavor.
