I LOVED this recipe! It's simple, delicious, and a very different take on swiss chard. One caveat, you must like the sour/bitter/pungent taste of lime pickle, as it's the most prominent flavor in the dish. One note, instead of boiling the chard, I simply sauteed it after sauteing the shallot. This worked fine and saved a step.

I tried to find the Indian Pickle at ethnicgrocer but was not successful. I found www.indianfoodsco.com instead and ordered their lime pickle - it was sweet but it was excellent. I absolutely love this pickle and it has become a favorite relish in our household. By the way I made the recipe but used the pickle on the side and not in the recipe. Nice recipe for greens and the pickle adds the flavor kick.

This was delicious and a new "take" on preparing chard. I didn't follow the salt additions, and I probably should have. Added salt at the end instead and found it was really better with the additional salt. Remember the chard cooks down quite a bit. Use frozen if you can find it.

make sure you pick through the lime pickle and remove any of the pits/seeds before blending

This was an exceptionally delicious side dish.

We actually threw this out- the taste was really overwhelming, and just not tasty. Tossed some snap peas in sesame oil instead.

Fantastic flavours, very refreshing, easy to make. One caveat: I wouldn't recommend boiling the chard for any more than a couple of minutes unless you want a pulp from which all nutrition has been leeched. I just blanched the chard, drained it, and sauteed it lightly with the shallots and sauce.

I love greens, any kind and this recipe is excellent. I did a search on epicurious to look for new ways to make swiss chard, one of my winter favorites and came across this recipe, Indian cuisine is also one of my favorites. This recipe is quick and easy to make, it's healthy and the flavor has so much punch! It's a great side dish to any meal. Try it with (believe it or not) potato pierogis (also low fat) and plain yogurt for a complete delicious and quick meal. BTW, I used Patak's Mild Lime Relish, which is available in most upscale grocery stores, on-line @ ethnicgrocer.com or in indian speciality stores.
