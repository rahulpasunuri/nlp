This one is a keeper. We made some small mods: broiled the medallions, subbed plain yogurt for half of the creme fraiche, used stone ground mustard because I didn't have any Dijon. Excellent.

loved. i finally got around to making this and its definitely a keeper. used low fat sour cream because that's what i had. also made using a whole loin of pork (about a pound - halved the recipe) and cooked in the oven while making the sauce.

This recipe is fantastic and very forgiving but wouldn't substitute the fresh herbs for dry.

Delicioso! I made a few changes after reading a few others reviews...like low-fat sour cream, and I actually used 2/3's of what the recipe called for. I had pork steaks, bone-out instead, and marinated the pork already with rosemary, thyme, s&p, so I omitted the chives and tarragon that this recipe calls for at the end. Lots of leftover sauce, and extremely tasty-- my hubby loved it!

Great recipe. Made it without the leeks and with plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and thyme instead of tarragon. The combination of flavors worked out really well and I don't think we were missing anything with the subtractions/substitutions we made.

Made half recipe and used sour cream. I also braised the whole tenderloin and then cut into pieces when braising was complete. This is a great dish

Nice sauce, I didn't have chives or tarragon but I did add in some capers which were nice. Will make again, nice change for pork tenderloin.

This is a versatile recipe. Successfully reduced fat content by cutting amount of butter and using low-fat sour cream. Adapts well for vegetarians. Substitute vegetable stock and serve with thickly sliced Portobellos sautéed with garlic and white wine.

My husband loved this recipe-I used sour cream and more wine of course-other than that-don't change a thing! It is a wonderful dish!

Rating: 4
This was so elegant and delicious. I made the sauce ahead of time, and I used leeks and creme fraiche. I skipped the tarragon, though. I followed the cooking times exactly and it turned out a little underdone, but a couple more minutes in the sauce and it was absolutely perfect.

Delicious!!! I made it with the Creme Fraiche. It WAS sinful! I substituted shallots for the Leeks and used dry Tarragon instead of fresh because I didn't have any on hand. Next time I will make with low fat sour cream just to knock off a couple of calories but I doubt it will be any comparison to the Creme Fraiche.

Just made this dish tonight and we loved it. It was so easy, and the sauce was delish. Following the advice of other cooks, I used low fat sour cream (a brand you can buy at Whole Foods that has the consistency and taste of the real thing)and used shallots since I had them and didn't want to make a special trip to the market. It took 15 minutes to make and is worthy of serving to company. I served it with roasted green beans with garlic and fresh dill and roasted red potatoes with fresh rosemary and shavings of parmesan. Gourmet in a flash! Thanks for another winner.

I made the dish with shallots instead of leeks and low-fat sour cream instead of creme fraiche. It was delicious. You really don't need anything richer than the low-fat sour cream. In fact I can't imagine how it would be with creme fraiche - very sinful, I guess!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious!! I made this for my husband me, last night, and we absolutely loved it. This recipe will go into my collection of dishes to serve at special dinner parties. Side note: The suggested wine is a medium-body, fruity red wine... however, the picture shows a very nice glass of white. hmmm ;)

Tender pork in a flavorful sauce- definitely will make this one again. I halved the recipe, used shallots instead of leeks and we had more than enough for four of us. Yum

This recipe was awesome! We used shallots instead of leeks, also. My 13 year old daughter, who puts ranch dressing on EVERYTHING ate every bite. This one is a keeper. I think the sauce would work great with chicken also.

I served this with 2 thick pork chops (cut recipe in half). Used shallots instead of leeks and couldn't find tarragon. I'm usually not a fan of sauce, but this one was amazing.

Tarragon is a great match for pork tenderloin. Even if you use onions or shallots, instead of leeks, this dish will be a big hit.

Rating: 3
This dish was outstanding! Very heavy and rich. My husband and I prepared this for guests and their eyes rolled back in their heads at the first bite. I would not choose this as an everyday type of entree because of the heaviness of the sauce, but it was the ultimate treat! Very very easy to make. We decided against the tarragon and were so pleased with the outcome. A great dish to wow at dinner parties!

Very easy & delicious. I would make this again & again. Eveyone loved it. We had with a red zinfandel & that was also a good pairing.

Just OK...my husband is not a big fan of tarragon, so he didn't like it at all. I thought it was decent for the amount of time spent (little).

Very, very good!! I toned down the mustard to 1 tbs and only used 4 tbs sour cream. The mustard comes through about right for my taste at 1 tbs. 3 tbs would be to overpowering for my taste.

We had all the ingredients available except leeks (used shallots) and creme fraiche (used sour cream), even the herbs right out of the garden - so perfect for a pick-up meal after work, theoretically. Still, we found the dish to be kind of boring. Unusual to be disappointed by an Epicurious recipe, but must be honest!

I was surprised by how easy and yummy this dish turned out to be! I had never cooked leeks before and found the meal and experience a pleasure.

Made this recipe tonight & my husband loved it. Used beef broth & sour cream but still tasted rich. Was nice to use my herbs from my garden. Don't get to use tarragon much.

Yummy. I used cream fraiche and this dish was wonderful. I also used beef broth since I didn't have chicken broth. It was delicious! I also grilled the pork tenderloin instead of roasting. We all enjoyed this dish and will make it again.

Made this last night, mostly followed the recipe, and loved it. I used shallots as well. Didn't have tarragon or parsely, so just used the chives and it was fine. I only had smooth dijon and it also seemed okay to me. I used the creme fraiche, but I wonder if a low-ish fat version could be done with lowfat or nonfat sour cream and get the same effect. I may try that next time. Sauce really was fantastic-I had to stop my self from drowning my side dishes in it (rice and salad). I bet this would be good with chicken too.

Rating: 3
This is a terrific sauce. Used minced shallots (2T+/-) in lieu of the leeks. Smooth Dijon and added whole mustard seeds. Pan fried the pork in 2 big pieces rather than 6 to get more of a grilled effect on the meat and more "bits" to deglaze, which adds flavor to the sauce. Instead of adding the fresh chives to the sauce, I clipped them onto the plated dish instead of the parsley. Lots of flexibility here. A clear winner.

This is a great dish - easy and flavorful. I have made this a bunch of times; it tastes much more complex to make than it is.

Rating: 3
This was great. I also agree that there was a bit too much texture to the sauce - next time I would either chop the leeks extra fine in the food processor beforehand, or else puree the sauce after cooking it. The flavor was great. A keeper.

This was an awesome dish and I will surely make it again and again.

Rating: 3
We loved this, however I must admit I made a few changes. I used bone-in pork chops, 1/2 cup regular cream instead of creme fraiche or sour cream, I only used about heaping 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard and I used dried tarragon instead of fresh. Additionally, I added sliced mushrooms and garnished the top each serving with diced fresh tomatoes and minced parsley. My family loved it and asked for it again.

Lovely, easy, weeknight meal. Replaced sour cream with plain yogurt, as I always do- still creamy & delicious but with less fat. Used shallots in place of leeks because that is what I had. Will make again.

We liked this recipe, but it didn't particularly wow us. We just thought it was a bit bland. This is the first recipe from epicurious that has ever disappointed us; we probably won't make this one again.

My sauce looked nothing like the picture with this recipe. Mine was thick and gloppy and an unpleasant color. I thought the mustard overpowered; could not taste the leeks nor the chive.

Too mustardy - I'd give it one fork, but my husband said he liked it, but he's pretty kind about my cooking. So, I think 2 forks is being generous.

I have to agree with saucytango from CA, this sauce was not "saucy" enough-it needs to be pureed. The overall taste was very good, even though I used dried herbs in place of fresh (and I'm talking CHEAP dried herbs here)z

Rating: 2
I guess I'm not a big fan of Tarragon, but I was not bowled over by this dish. The sauce tasted great before I added the Tarragon. I used low fat sour cream and it was fine. I think I'll pass on making this again. Not a fan of pork and creamy sauces on it, but I wanted to try the recipe since it got such rave reviews.

Rating: 3
Scrumptious! My only critique would be that my sauce didn't turn out "saucy" enough. Instead it was very "leeky," which was fine - still tasted great. Next time, however, I'll either double the sauce or puree half of it before serving.

I really liked this recipe...used fat free sour cream and it still tasted delicious. My husband is already asking for it again

I have tried so many recipes from here and they have all turned out fantastic! I have to say, this was aweful! I threw out the sauce and started over again, I stopped at the chicken broth and added cream, tyme. I simmered and put over wheat pasta. This version turned out wonderful, however it took me 3 hours to get to this point.

A great dish - easy and impressive. I didn't have all the right ingredients and it still came out great: subbed plain onion, fat-free sour cream, smooth dijon and dried tarragon. The addition of the tarragon turned a so-so sauce into something intense and special.

Rating: 4
Amazing recipe - easy and delicious. I didn't have all the right ingredients and it was still terrific. Subbed plain onion, smooth Dijon, fat free sour cream and dried tarragon and ended up with a beautiful and intense sauce. I think the tarragon is what brings all the flavors up - before I added it the sauce was OK but after - well, just try it.

This dish is delicious! Lovely with the leeks. I also threw in some fresh rosemary, and that made it very fragrant. Increase the sauce recipe, so there is more to go around. (I notice the photo shows a glass of white, yet the recommendation is for red!)

Halved the ingredients for the two of us...my store did not have leeks or chives, so like another reviewer, I used scallions & threw in a stray shallot. Dried tarragon worked fine...this is a delicious way to prepare pork tenderloin. Sauce is delicous as well as visually pleasing. Can't wait to make it with leeks & fresh chives & tarragon.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was wonerful. I doubled the recipe without a problem. I kept the pork warm after I sauteed it in a 200 degree oven. I used 2 frying pans & sauteed in 2 rounds. I did this right before the guests arrived. I then did the final steps of the sauce [mustard & I used light sour cream] when I was ready to serve & put the meadllions back in the sauce. I feel like I have a new easy and relatively inexpensive company meal!

Felt like I was "out for dinner". A delicious dish that even my picky son liked. Unfortunately I had no chives (they had just frozen) and didn't have time to purchase any...but it didn't really matter. The "leeky" sauce was divine. This will become a standard in my house. And perfect for company because you can make the sauce ahead!

Im' giving this recipe 2 forks because it took too much time to prepare. The cooking method was easy but it took time to get all of the ingredients together. I thought there was too much butter and oil in it. I like less fat. I didn't think end result was worth the time and effort. I would not make this dish again.

I loved this simple and delicious recipe. I did modify to what I had on hand: I used green onions instead of leeks and thinly sliced green onion tops instead of chives. I used 1/4 cup plain yogurt and 1/4 cup buttermilk instead of the creme fraiche. I deleted the parsley and olive oil and used a hint of dried tarragon instead of fresh. Despite all these changes, it was delicious. Definitely make again for a quick and delish weeknight meal.
