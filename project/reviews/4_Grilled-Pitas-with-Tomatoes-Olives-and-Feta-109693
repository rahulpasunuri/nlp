So yummy with these changes: Increase tomatoes to 1 1/2 cups; decrease red onion to 1/8 cup; replace mint with basil; add 1/2 can artichoke hearts, chopped.

This is a great recipe for a quick, easy and delicious light meal. I added a couple spices besides mint, which I don't like, but otherwise didn't change the recipe.

I added chopped artichoke hearts ...delicious!

another good addition to this combination is goat cheese instead of feta, using basil, and a drizzle of balsamic syrup to garnish

Since I am not a mint lover and as suggested by the previous reviewer, I added basil to the mixture. It was very delicious! Also, to make it faster and easier, I just tossed everything into the broiler for 375C.

This went over quite well at a bbq, but I would make a few changes next time because I thought the saltiness of the feta and olives overpowered the tomatoes (and I used French feta which is one of the least salty fetas). I also had rinsed the olives. Next time I will use more tomatoes and fewer olives and will put in chopped basil instead of or in addition to the mint. I've made it on a grill and also on a cast iron griddle, finishing under a broiler. Either way, you have to watch the pita carefully and get the topping on quickly or it will burn. Definitely a keeper, though

This recipe is incredibly easy, fast and delicious! I left off the mint, but this is now a staple in our house. Every time I make it I can't believe how good it is.

Even a broke, busy college kid can pull off this recipe. Added pieces of cooked shrimp, and it was the perfect addition to make it a little bit more filling.

i haven't been that hungry with the summer heat, but this was one thing that just looked so good. Unlike so many other recipes, it was as delicious as it looks. It's exciting to eat with so many flavors artfully combined. I'd definately eat it again and recommend it to everyone.

As a cook of Greek heritage,this recipe really appealed to me.

I don't have a working barbecue and couldn't find the mint Mom claimed she had in abundance in her garden so I made this minus the mint and under the broiler. The pita got too dark and crispy but the topping is good and was fast and easy to make.

I agree with the previous rater. Easy and delicious. Already a staple week day recipe at home.

This was wonderful, very easy, and quick. A little on the salty side, but a big hit. I'll definitely make this a "regular" weeknight meal!!
