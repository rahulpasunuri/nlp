I made this for Thanksgiving to try something different. I made the sauce and potatoes ahead, which was a big help in getting all the dishes ready right before dinner. I omitted the expresso powder, as I did not want the coffee to over power the dish. I added 1 exra tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tbsp of Grand Manier. Everyone loved the smokey edge to the sweetness of the potatoes and people raved about the flavor. This will definately be added to many more dinners!

Excellent - I did both the potatoes & sauce the day ahead, then reheated each separately & combined before serving on a platter with chopped almonds on top This would be better titled "Sweet Potatoes with Bourbon Red-Eye Glaze". The coffee taste one reviewer didn't like is the defining flavor of red eye gravy, a signature of the South.

Truly delicious...even to the folks who attested to usually not liking sweet potatoes. I made the sauce the day before and was really unsure about it, but once on the sweet potatoes it is just right. The smoked almonds were delicious on top. And like other reviewers, I roasted the sweet potatoes (both light and dark orange) in a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper instead of all the butter the recipe calls for.

I made these for Thanksgiving--made the sauce the day before and had to do it over again because while I was reducing it, I didn't pay enough attention and it went from wonderful to burned VERY fast! I don't like bourbon, so I used cognac instead and it worked well. As far as serving it to children, the sauce is cooked so long that all the alcohol evaporates.

This was a huge hit. I made it once before Thanksgiving to work out the bugs. Reduction of the sauce initially took much longer than expected. The second time I made the sauce ahead and refrigerated it before reheating which thickened it somewhat. Be sure to get those yams browned so keep them intact and improve flavor.

Made this on Thanksgiving and was a huge hit, very good. I used spiced rum instead of the bourbon

This is only an okay recipe....The coffee taste was little overpowering...I would have liked more of the bourbon and maple syrup to shine through. It was a a lot of work for something not so delicious.

Can someone tell me why people bother to post a review on a recipe they have altered as by "A Cook on 11/23/12" did on this recipe? It's not helpful to anyone. I read the reviews to get feedback and suggestions based on the exact recipe.

Forgot to add...I used much less butter and just a drizzle of olive oil. Worked out fine as well.

Made this for Thanksgiving, the entire party loved it. The sauce is a great balance to the sweet potatoes.You can speed up the reduction process by using a wider pan. More heat surface means quicker reduction.

Did not use the sauce...the best part of this recipe is the roasting of the potaotes...finished the sweet potatoes with just some brown sugar, maple, butter orange juice drizzled over potatoes......

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving table. We liked the complex bittersweet flavors. I just saw one reviewer's suggestion of roasting 15 minutes, then pouring sauce over to roast for last 15 minutes, which I will try next time to meld the potatoes and sauce a little more.

OK but not great. The sauce was complex and interesting but the reduction took too long. Also too much butter/olive oil on the roasting potatoes. I'm still looking for a dynamite sweet potato recipe for Turkey Day

Very enjoyable, sweet complex flavors. In addition to serving throughout the year, this will become a Thanksgiving tradition. The whole family, adults and kids, liked the savory, caramel taste.

Loved this! Cooked potatoes 30 minutes, poured sauce over them and roasted another 15. The coffee was a wonderful ingredient!

This is a "Good" dish not a delicious dish. I like Bourbon, so I was happy with the taste and the aroma that comes out while the potatoes are still warm. Having said that, this is not a sweet potato dish I would make for "family." This is a dish I would make for adults. It is a nice diversion from the old stand by... overly sweet potato with mini marshmellows. Not a family favorite though.

This is a good recipe to change up sweet potatoes. The sauce is also great on a roasted pork.
