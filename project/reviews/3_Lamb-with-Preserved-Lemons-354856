Per the previous reviewer, I had to add water to during cooking. Very tasty outcome, but a little dry. I would recommend covering at some point after meat has carmelized,

I'm not sure I would use this for entertaining - it is not pretty. It is really very tasty and as easy as pie. I blended all the ingredients together and poured over the lamb. I did need to add more water twice during cooking, but then I couldn't bring myself to add the all butter.
