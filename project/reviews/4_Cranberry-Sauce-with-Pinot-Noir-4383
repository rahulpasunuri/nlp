a few reviews said this recipe had too much of the ginger and spices, wanting to make a cranberry sauce that had a milder flavor, while still having something more than just the cranberries, i only used 1/2 a tablespoon of the fresh minced ginger, and only 2 tablespoons of crystallized ginger. I didn't however, cut down on the 5 spice or curry powder. the resulting dish came out very good, but the ginger and spices weren't very noticeable, so next time I may very well use the full amounts. If you want a thinner cranberry sauce that still has a hint of the pinot noir in it when you're serving it, I suggest cooking it the same day and serving immediately, if you would prefer the sauce be thicker, and the cranberries subdue the flavor of the wine, make it a day or two ahead and let it sit in the fridge.

Modified this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. Did not use curry powder or Chinese spice and used only a dash of powdered ginger. Added orange zest. This cranberry sauce was very sweet! My husband tolerated it, but he doesn't like sweeter things in general. Next time, I'm gonna try decreasing the amount of sugar and Pinot Noir to 1 cup and adding 1 cup of water.

A guest brought this recipe to Thanksgiving dinner last night and it was fabulous. Can't wait to make it myself.

Beyond exceptional. I hesitated about adding the crystallized ginger, but gave it a try, and it was not overpowering at all. This is definitely going in the WIN column.

This cranberry sauce has been on my Thanksgiving menu for at least 8 years. It tastes best when made a few days ahead. Use it on a leftover turkey sandwich and your taste buds will thank you.

I make this every year for the holidays, but always use half the sugar. Excellent!

Ever since I first made this dish several years ago, it has become the must-have condiment for any holiday meal. Perfect as a relish for traditional turkey dinners, or try it as a topping for brie - just cut the top rind off the brie, spread a generous portion of this sauce over the top, then pop it in the oven until the cheese is warmed through. It's an ideal appetizer or buffet table addition.

Holy bog fruit, batman. I was tipped off to this recipe by friends who raved on and on. They were not wrong! They warned me about the ginger being overpowering, so I used 2/3 the amount called for of fresh ginger, then added minced crystalized ginger to taste. Likely about 2/3 what was called for. I had to adjust all the amounts as I used a 12 oz. bag of cranberries, and I sort of do everything to taste, anyway, which is why I don't have exact measurements of what actually went in.

I just made this recipe (as written except used a good Merlot) and it definitely will be a standard for years to come! One of the best cranberry sauces I have ever had.

I made this last year for the inlaws at Thanksgiving & it was such a hit I made it again for Christmas at my parents! One suggestion: choose a dry, bold wine - it makes a difference!

I make this recipe exactly as presented for every Thanksgiving and Christmas and it is a consistent hit. I always have to make extra because it is on the top of the list of leftovers that everyone wants to take home!

I've made a lot of the cranberry recipes from epicurious and this is one of the best. I only used half the curry, which most people thought was a good move. Even my son, who rarely eats cranberry sauce had seconds.

Incredible flavors, I was a hater of cranbery sauce before this recipe.

my mother-in-law was bringing Indian food for thanksgiving? i just could do without some traditional dishes so i choose this because of the curry powder. It was yummy! i skipped the crystallzed ginger and used only 3/4 c sugar. i had to cook a little longer to reduce. One guest said it was "the best cranberry sauce he's ever had".

Much sweeter than I had anticipated. Maybe my fault-I used sweet curry instead of hot curry. Love the ginger in this dish, but I felt it was too sweet to eat on its own. I paired it with pork chops and it was delicious, but next time I would look at cutting down on the sweetness.

Good, but be sure to make it the day you are going to serve it. Otherwise the ginger takes over.

What a fabulous recipe! I couldn't find enough fresh cranberries to make enough, so I made two batches. One with fresh berries, following the recipe excactly, and 1 with canned. With the canned, I simply omitted adding extra sugar. I also added a bit of orange zest. Both were awesome, my guests devoured it! Definitely the only cranberry recipe for me!

A great alternative to the usual cranberry sauce. I agree with others who said they would cut down on the sugar and curry. I doubled the recipe except for the curry and it was still VERY strong -- and I LIKE curry! I think it depends on the curry you use and probably also on whether or not you make the sauce ahead of time. This would definitely benefit from talking to itself for at least 24 hours. My first taste made me think of a chutney! Delicious! I think it would also serve well as an accompaniment to more robust meats.

This was absolutely delicious. The ginger and curry added such interesting (and addictive) flavors. The morning after making it I had to eat some more before I left for work to remind myself how good it was! If you don't want to spend the money on crystalized ginger, you could probably forgo it and add a little more fresh ginger. Next time I am going to reduce the sugar to make it a little less sweet. I served it alongside chicken and it made the meal.

I've never been a fan of cranberries or cranberry relish, but I love this recipe. It's an elegant addition to Thanksgiving dinner for adults, but kids do not care for it (as if they care for plain cranberries!).

Now into our second Thanksgiving with this recipe, suggested by a gourmand friend, it's risen to become a Turkey Day must-have and is well-shared with those near and far. We use a medium value Pinot, this year a 2001, worth experimenting with other varietals and vintages. While the spicy ingredients seem counter-intuitive to a sweet sauce, the alchemy works.

This has been my standard (grown-up) cranberry sauce recipe since 1997, when I first saw it in the magazine. It's fantastic. And works well with pork, chicken, as a glaze, etc, etc, etc.

Absolutely Fabulous!! Will definetly be making this any time cranberry sauce is needed. Doubling the receipe works perfect too, just follow the recipe to the tee. Was a little worried about the ginger, but the end result was amazing. Such great flavors beyond compare. Non cranberry enthusiastes enjoyed the taste and was amazed by the flavors.

Excellent! I made this to backup Cranberry Sauce with Cherries, Marsala and Rosemary, since this was a first attempt at CS and didn't want to bring soup! I thought this worked better in concert with Turkey rather than stand alone since it wasn't as sweet as the other. Additionally, I would definitely lower the curry by 1/2. It was too overpowering to the other flavors. Overall, an excellent recipe though, and definitely enhances itself after a full day in the fridge.

AWESOME!! Added to my recipes that will make every year.

This is one of the best cranberry sauces that I've ever made. A perfect balance of sweet, tart, and spicy. I also like how it turns out when you fry the cranberries a bit first before adding the water. I think this makes the cranberries hold their shape a bit better and not turn to mush. A new holiday favorite at our house.

This is on our Thanksgiving table every year since seeing it in the Nov.'97 BA - the best issue ever! It's even requested by my father who, until this, preferred the cranberry sauce "straight out of the can, with the little wrinkles on it."

This was a fantastic alternative to the traditional cranberry sauce. The ginger added such a wonderful spicy sweet flavor...I couldn't stop eating it! I agree with one of the other reviewers that this would make a tasty accompaniement to a more hearty meat dish, but I did not find that it overpowered the turkey in any way. It was delicious cold, with leftovers, as well.

My husband and I are not big cranberry fans and I have been looking for a recipe for cranberry sause that we both like (and the cranberry fans in our family like too). I made this for thanksgiving and it was a big hit. It will be on our thanksgiving menu next year for sure. I substituted a Canadian Gamay Noir for the Pinot Noir and it was great.

Excellent texture. The curry and fivespice make this recipe a bit much for a Thanksgiving turkey accompanyment, but I bet it would be great with something more robust, like a pork roast. I'll also probably retry it without those spices as a turkey accompanyment.

Delicious, the spices in this dish are an excellent counterpoint to the tartness of the cranberries and the sweetness of the sugar and wine. Well worth the time and expense.
