I make this every year for Christmas! It is by far the best mashed potato recipe.

It's different, it's delicious! Increase garlic by 200 %. Saffron enhances the yellow collor, making a beautiful presentation with grilled meats and a green veggie.

This is a great recipe. I used 1/4 c. shallots as was out of regular onions. Perfect!

I've tried this with both russet and Yukon Gold and prefer the Yukon Gold - creamier, and I like the pale yellow color with the corn. The addition of corn is great - I like the crunch. This is a family favorite. It's really good with the Chili-Rubbed Rib Eye Steaks on this site.

This was fantastic, I changed the cream to skim milk, came out perfect and not so rich.

Last time I mashed potatoes they were Yukon golds. I used just a bit of butter and enough low-fat buttermilk to make it creamy. Try this!

A fantastic side dish with grilled steak! The difference between this dish and other similiar recipes is the addition of FRESH corn.

this is the best! not for the faint of heart tho - very rich - can cut it by doing 1/2 cream and 1/2 skim or 2% milk - really great with grilled ribeyes!

I have made this dish several times over the last year and each time I absolutely love it. It's the ultimate in comfort food for me. I love the corn and the addition of onions. I used the cream, but only make this on special occasions.

I thought these very very good but didn't "make my tongue want to slap my brains out" good. They did have a very good flavor however.

I made this with fat-free half and half and Butter Buds. Also used the frozen white corn from Trader Joes and mixed everything together in one step. Really yummy!

Made this without the corn and was wonderfull!! The saffron gave it an unbelievable flavor. Was incredibly easy, will make again.

My wife just loved this recipe. She has asked that it be made for her next dinner party.

Great twist to the typical garlic mashed. I made the recipe exactly as shown except lightened it up by using evaporated skim milk and I alwways use extra garlic. I served it with Chili-Rubbed Rib-Eye Steaks (BA 7/2000) and a layered spinach salad. Wonderful menu!

This recipe was okay. I prefer to roast garlic & squeeze the cloves into cooked potatoes prior to mashing. The corn didn't really add anything to the dish. I hope the leftovers make tasty potato pancakes.

Garlic flavor got WAY too strong the next day! But, the day it was make, it was delicious! I might try to lower the fat content next time-- the cream made the potatoes slightly heavy.

I've made this twice - once with saffron, once without. I actually prefer it without - the saffron seemed to cover up the garlic taste. It's a wonderful recipe - everyone loves it!

We liked this dish a lot. I used sweet Vadalia onions, as my husband is not much of an onion fan. Added slightly more corn, and, noting an earlier review stating the garlic flavor to be lost, added two extra cloves. This certainly helped! I could not taste the saffron, and would either omit it next time or add more. I served this with Jerk Pork Chops and black beans.

Yummy! This was sooo good, we loved it. My guest had 3 helpings! Anything with heavy cream is going to be good! I made this just the way the recipe said, but instead of having it sit for 20 minutes, I just had it sit for 10 (Due to time contraints) and it was just fine. I'm making this again!

We have made this dish about 6 times in the last 8 weeks. It goes great with grilled food and is easy to make ahead and keep warm when entertaining. Try it you won't be disappointed.

This was a GREAT easy to make dish that went over with everyone,, I made it with Fresh sweet corn,,, a real keeper...

I thought these potatoes were pretty good, but for garlic mashed potatoes - they had a lot of onions! I thought the garlic taste was lost a bit. Next time I'm not going to use any onion, and probably at least 9 cloves of garlic...

This was very good. I changed the recipe a bit, to make it less fattening. I cut the cream in half and added low fat milk. Tasted creamy and smooth. Needs salt and pepper.

Was easy to make and stayed well in low oven till guests arrived and the ribs were done!

These were excellent...I served them with homemade meatloaf and roasted asparagus with mushrooms. I got several compliments on it. I used extra sweet frozen corn, and made sure it had thawed prior to cooking, and it gave the dish a very sweet flavor which the guests loved. Didn't have saffron, but nobody missed it :)

Without a doubt, this is the best garlic mashed potato I've ever tasted! The flavors in this recipe are delicious. With the whipping cream, it is definately an indulgence, but I would encourage anyone to follow the recipe exactly at least the first time. These potatoes are perfect with any grilled entree. I omitted the saffron threads only because they were not available at my grocery. I'm not sure what they would have added because the recipe was divine without them!

This is honestly one of the best mashed potato recipe's we have tried! The taste is sublime and is a sure crowd pleaser. However, it is a bit rich and something light such as chicken is a good compliment. We changed the recipe a bit and used 1/2 cup whipping cream and a quarter cup 1% milk. Make sure to sautee the onions well so they are nice and soft. Fantastic!
