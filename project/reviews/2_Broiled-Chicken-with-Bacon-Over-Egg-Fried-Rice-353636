This was a complete waste of time, money & food! I can't believe it even made it here.

This was a great little recipe for using up leftovers. I added some hot sauce to the mix with good results. Sometimes frugal can be very delicious!

Instant quick favorite. The sesame oil coats the pan and transfers to the rice to make it smoky and delicious. I did eyeball the ingredients and probably added a bit more than called for on the sauces.

Why so bland? This recipe, entitled "Dinner For Two" would better have been named "Dinner For Two-Year Olds". After tasting, I added more soy sauce and crushed red pepper flakes. Mediocre at best.
