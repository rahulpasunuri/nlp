This is one of only a few dishes in rotation at our house. It's fresh and balanced, and tasty enough to make you forget you're eating healthy food. The recipe is great as written, but can be modified depending on what's in your pantry. I usually double the tuna, and use anchovy paste if I don't have any anchovy fillets. Add some pesto if you don't have enough basil. You can also make the tuna-tomato mix ahead of time in order to make a really quick dinner.

An absolute must when your garden is overflowing with ripe summer tomatoes (or the local market is...) I prefer the addition of 1 T good-quality balsamic vinegar,a minced green onion, and extra pepper and don't skimp on the anchovies :O)

Yummy weeknight meal. I doubled the garlic (crushed, rather than minced) and served with grated Parmesan.

I've made this dish many times and each time it turns out excellent. You can make it with or without the anchovies. Be sure to let the first 6 ingredients stand at room temperature for 1 hr. I didn't do that once and the pasta turned out bland.

BLAND! I FOLLOWED OTHER REVIEWERS. I ADDED CHOPPED KALAMATA OLIVES, RED PEPPER FLAKES AND USED GRILLED FRESH AHI TUNA WITH TOP GRADE OLIVE OIL, AN EXTRA CLOVE OF GARLIC AND IT WAS STILL JUST OK. SOMETHING .MISSING, MAYBE IF THE TUNA WERE BLACKENED? MAYBE SOME LEMON ZEST? DON'T KNOW BUT WON'T MAKE IT AGAN.

I'm never too excited about tuna recipes, but I have a surplus, saw the great reviews, and gave this dish a try. Not only did it look beautiful in color with the fresh basil, tomatoes and capers, but it was delicious! I did use water packed tuna (fewer calories), I skipped the anchovies, put lots of extra garlic, and took the advice of a couple other reviewers by adding balsamic vinegar, mixing the basil into the tuna mix, and heating the mixture up for a minute before adding in the "penne" pasta. Really great, quick and easy!

This is our favorite meal when I don't feel like cooking. It goes together quickly and the flavor is out of this world. Serve it with a garden salad and you have a complete meal. We prefer to use penne pasta instead of the spaghetti.

Very delicious. A great weekday quick meal. I added peas, and shaved some parmesan on before serving.

We love this easy dinner and so does my picky picky picky three year old! Easy to play around with, too. I've used chopped canned tomatoes too, and it is still pretty good. I disagree about having to use the Italian tuna-- the supermarket albacore (in water, drained) works great with some good EV olive oil. It's a great weeknight dish.

This dish was delicious although I did use fresh tuna, grilled, instead of canned and I'm sure this made a big difference. This dish is extremely flavorful and just as good leftover.

yummmm, this is super easy to prepare and so tasty. I prefer to gently cook all the ingredients together(except the basil) for 3-5 minutes to meld the flavors. Also good with a splash of balsamic vinegar and a grating of asiago cheese. This dish really needs the oil packed tuna, IMO, water pack tuna does not work in this dish.

Intensly flavored...and I LIKE that! Next time I may use TWO cans of anchovies because the anchovy flavor got lost. I cut the oil in half--1/4 cup of olive oil is all that is needed. I too forgot to mince the capers...but that was OK. Good pasta, but you gotta like big, bold, flavors.

This is so easy and yet so tasty. Brilliant way to use up mass influx of homegrown tomatoes! My husband has always said he doesn't like tuna and capers yet he loves this (didn't tell him till afterwards what was in it!).

Simple, basic, easy. I used white tuna in water, because that's all I had. Also, I forgot to chop the capers, and the recipe didn't suffer. This is good simple recipe for an easy meal at home.

This recipe is fantastic and SO easy! I made it for a small dinner party. We started off with shrimp cocktail and ended with blueberries and sorbet. Great for a hot summer night on the patio. I recommend using only 1 pound of pasta and chopping the basil fine.

We've made this several times and love it! (but it's best in summer -- there's something about the flavors on a warm summer evening that are really wonderful). The last time we made it, we treated ourselves to fresh tuna steaks - yum!

I absolutely ADORE this recipe. It is excellent for a Saturday or Tuesday night dinner! Do try it!

This recipe is easier (and less expensive) than ordering pizza! I loved this, the flavors are well balanced and sophisticated.

I only had tuna in water, didn't seed the tomatoes and added chopped sweet onions. I also added the basil to the tuna-tomato mixture. This could become our favorite summertime dish!

An easy dish which is quick to assemble with plenty of flavors. Great for a hot summer evening dinner.

With summer fresh tomatos, this was really wonderful. And it was a nice, easy dinner. I had the sauce ingredients marinating on the counter and when it was time to eat, put the pasta on to boil. My husband, who is not a tuna fan, thought this was wonderful and is re-evaluating tuna.

This was OUTSTANDING! I did use fresh tuna that I grilled on the BBQ before. I am not sure I would like canned tuna as much. My hubby is very picky and he ADORED this. Fabulous Dinner and great reaheated for lunch! I also made the green bean and arugala salad to go with this and it was a FAB dinner!

I love this recipe - it is a healthy mix and the assertive flavors blend together deliciously

Finding this recipe was worth the cost of my subscription alone! It is very quick, delicious and the leftovers are just as tasty. I agree with the reviewer who suggested to add the basil to the tuna mixture. I've made this a few times and that makes a big difference. I use canned smoked albacore tuna from Oregon and nix the anchovy fillets so it doesn't interfere with the tuna.

Have made this dish several times and really love the intense flavors. The only negative is getting a craving for it in wintertime when the tomatoes are less than great. Italian tuna a must, try salt-packed capers (rinsed) for less briny (sp?) taste...Fab leftovers.

Rating: 4
It was delicious! My husband doesn't like tuna but loved this dish. And, it was tasty heated up the next day too. One thing I'd do differently is put the basil in with the mixture (tuna, olive oil, etc.) earlier to soak up the flavor - so that the basil doesn't taste too raw.

What a great and simple dish. I think the key is the italian tuna and some lemon at the end. The whole meal took at most a half hour to prepare. I would definately make this again.

Way too "fishy" for my taste. And a waste of my homegrown roma tomatoes and basil.

Delicious. Italian tuna makes a big difference. This is one of my favorites.

I've made this many times using linguini. It's quick and delicious. I add a little lemon juice to the mixture when cooking and lots of black pepper at the end. I've also thrown in chopped artichoke hearts for a variation. It's a family favorite.

A nice way to use leftover basil. I will try the Italian tuna next time and use the anchovies. A pretty good summer pasta meal.

I have made this recipe--with variations--many,many times. The anchovies can be omitted--the flavor suffers(IMO), but one must sometimes cater to the faint of heart..

This was easy to put together and very tasty. Actually, I made the magazine's sides, too. They were warmed spiced olives and a salad of arugula and a walnut oil dressing. The whole meal went really well together.

This was wonderful. Great dish for a warm weekday evening here in Anchorage. I took one reviewer's suggestions and added a little crushed red pepper. Yum. Also added some slivered nicoise olives which were a great addition. I already planned to use tuna packed in olive-oil and thought I'd do a taste comparison. I used one 6 ounce can imported from Italy and one 6 ounce can of StarKist (or Chicken of the Sea...I can't remember now), both packed in OLIVE oil. Surprisingly, there was not much difference. Both were very good. Try it...you'll like it. Bon Appetite!

Love this for a summer-time dinner with home-grown tomatoes. I urge you to buy good-quality Italian, olive oil packed tuna from your local Italian deli or gourmet grocery. Standard super-market tuna, especially the white, water-packed variety, just doesn't work as well. I up the capers a bit, and add a spash of red wine vinegar just before serving.

This is a wonderful quick & easy dish. I suggest a pinch of red pepper flakes & Italian tuna in olive oil. MUCH better product. If not, water packed, drained & your favorite olive oil is still better than tuna in regular oil.

Rating: 2
This was ok but I didn't find it that interesting. I think the addition of olives would help. It is quick (to put together) and easy though so I'll probably give it another try.

I found this recipe easy to prepare and had lots of taste. I used fresh tuna that I grilled in a stove top pan. I also used cherry tomatoes that I cut in half.

So easy and delicious. A great summer recipe when you are wondering what to do with all those tomatoes and basil! We will definately make this again and again!

Used tuna in water, and added my own high quality olive oil. Used kalamata olives instead of capers, and extra garlic. Reheated it the following day and thought it did quite well, actually. I like the idea of yellow tomatoes; summer, homegrown tomatoes will make or break this recipe as far as I'm concerned.

Maybe it was the tuna in oil I didn't like. The best part was all the basil. It doesn't reheat well at all.

What a nice summer dinner dish. I have made it twice, using fresh tuna each time, sauteeing once and barbecuing the other. It's more expensive, but the fresh fish elevates this recipe above the mundane. Sweet yellow tomatoes add a lot. This dish is almost better the next day, eaten cold.
