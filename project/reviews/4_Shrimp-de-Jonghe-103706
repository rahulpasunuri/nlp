This recipe was a disaster. I followed it as written, but the shrimp were still a bit rubbery (even at 13 minutes rather than 15) and the topping was flavorless and mushy. I don't know what Wheatbix is, but if it is a smushy, mushy, soggy brown mash, I can totally see what the cook from Australia was talking about. It needed more garlic to pump up the flavor of the topping. What a waste of perfectly good jumbo shrimp.

All I can say is excellent, exactly as written (with the exception that I used dried parsley). It tastes like a delicious baked stuffed shrimp without the fuss. Company worthy.

We definitely liked this recipe and it was easy, which is good. I did not blanch the shrimp and it cooked up great but added about 5 minutes (we also doubled the recipe). I will cut back on the parsley, crush the toasted almonds and maybe add some lemon or lime next time. Still this is a solid recipe

I prepared this recipe as a main meal so I added some scallops and thick sliced calamari rings cut in half as well as the prawns. I doubled the quantity of the rest of the ingredients. Total cooking time ended up being 20 minutes.The flavour was fantastic. I only rated this recipe with three folks as I followed the recipe exactly unfortunetly the topping had the consistancy of soggy wheatbix (an Aussie breakfast cereal) Don't understand what happened, any tips for solving this problem would be appreciated as I would love to make it again.

Delicious! I was out of garlic so substituted shallots instead and it was fabulous. Also used slightly less butter. A real keeper!

I find that you can easily substitute scallops for shrimp in any recipe for a nice change. I made this with bay scallops and it was delicious. You probably can even use lobster chunks or king crab for a very special dinner. This was the only change. Next time I might add a bit of cream like another reviewer suggested. If you need a wonderful, special seafood entree, this is it.

Tasty and pretty too. But not the best Shrimp de Jonghe recipe.

This recipe is so easy to make. I love the fact that there is a small amount of bread crumbs and you add nuts. It is really good.

This was such an easy and tasty dish. I did make it as the recipe calls for, maybe added another tbsp of sherry, but it was really a hit at dinner. I asked my husband to rate this recipe and he gave it a 4 fork salute. I would not disagree with him. I look forward to making this recipe again soon. Yummy!

Made this exactly as written, except I used fresh Maine shrimp which were currently in season here. They are smaller than the ones called for in the recipe, but are extremely sweet. I also cooked the dish in individual serving-sized tapas dishes, which made a nice presentation. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent, the family loved it!

Easy, elegant and fast - what more could you want? I doubled this for Mother's day dinner last night as a main course. Even though I accidently left out the sherry and the parsley, it was wonderful. I'll probably tweak it a bit next time, but not much. Why mess with success?

I made this for Christmas as a side dish and it was a great combination of fast and delicious, and seemed sturdy enough to hold up to the inevitable delays of a large family holiday party. I used a reviewers suggestion and used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and it turned out great. For younger kids, though, not so much garlic.

This one was the hit of the party. Forget the 30 second blanching - just extra work and makes no difference. I used the Hawaiian sugar cane shrimp and it was fabuloso. 15 minutes in the oven with no blanching was almost a little too long.

HAAE FIXED THIS RECIPE FOR YEARS WITH THE ADDITION OF CREAM TO ENRICH THE RESULTANT SAUCE.

I've made this dish several times and served it over toast points. I also served it over rice but prefer the crunch of the toast points. It is a delicious recipe especially for garlic lovers. It is easy and elegant.

I have made this as an appetizer many times - always rave reviews.

This was delicious. I used frozen cooked shrimp and just defrosted and then followed recipe. Everyone loved it. Can assemble ahead of time, refridgerate and bring to room temperature before cooking.

This dish was simple to make and just delicious. Also, it could assembled ahead and then baked just before serving--an important advantage, in my book. Even though I did NOT assemble the dish ahead the first time I made it, it required about 25 minutes in the oven before the shrimp were done and the topping was lightly browned.
