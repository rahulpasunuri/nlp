I just tried making chocolate leaves--since its winter I don't have any in the garden and thought plastic ones might work -- what I ended up getting where silicone butter moulds - package had moulds for 6 ivy-shaped leaves and 6 roses. If you paint them thinly you can get a fairly thin leaf (but they are very fragile and you need to be careful getting them out. I also did some roses and filled them to see how thick they would be--the thicker ones were less fragile and I made some perfect ones. Worth considering.

I followed this recipe to the letter, but the leaves were extremely difficult to peel from the chocolate. I attempted to make a dozen or so, but only one was a success. There must be a better way.
