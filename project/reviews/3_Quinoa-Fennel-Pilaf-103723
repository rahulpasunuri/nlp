This was a bit of a disappointment, though I used chicken broth rather than water. I love plain quinoa, and I love fennel, but I agree with others that this combo is a bust.

This is a healthy alternative to comfort food (sans the butter - I used olive oil). The trick is not to overcook the veggies so they retain its wonderful flavor and a bit of the crunch and texture. Broth is a great suggestion. I have sprinkled my pilaf with top quality freshly graded parm. Next time I will add toasted pine nuts. I also want to try it with shitake mushrooms.

I think the main thing missing to make this great is some sort of herb, and as the others said, broth. I cooked it in a carrot and fennel broth and with slightly less fennel and half the onion replaced with a leek. I added Italian parsley (all I had fresh) though I don't think it's the right herb for it. Hm.

My family really loves this dish. I use chicken broth instead of water and usually a leek instead of fennel. Sometimes I add zucchini. After finding a pre washed brand of quinoa, I make this even more often. It's quick, easy and delicious. :)

Not that much flavor. the fennel flavor is not as strong as to give the quinoa a delicious flavor. maybe using fennel seeds? I added curry powder and then I liked it.

First time making quinoa and I was amazed at how good it was, and so was my guest. I did use the chicken broth, and I do think that's important.

bland and boring. Am I missing something that everyone else did? Needed a lot more flavor, or cheese or something

Outstanding. Made it with chicken broth and otherwise followed to a T, and it was a real crowd-pleaser. Amazing what a sense of richness a mere one tablespoon of butter can impart.

Very tasty overall. However, the next time I make this I will slightly reduce the proportion of veggies to the quinoa. I used chicken broth at the suggestion of another reviewer and think it is essential to the success of this recipe.

This was my first time making quinoa, and I was favorably impressed. It has a nice crunchy consistency and good flavor. I replaced 1/2 of the water for chicken stock, which I think made it more flavorable. Needed lots of salt and pepper.

This will become a dish I make over and over again. It's so easy and the taste is outstanding! Would be good with chicken broth too, I think (as a side dish with chicken).

This recipe is excellent! The texture is very light, and toasting the quinoa with the vegetables enhances the nutty flavor of the quinoa. Be sure to follow the directions and rinse the quinoa WELL to reduce bitterness. I had broiled salmon with mustard-dill sauce with the pilaf, a great combination!

Try this with the chili glazed salmon that was in the same Gourmet issue. AWESOME!

Although a very simple recipe, this dish was very satisfying, and the fennel shone through. I used vegetable stock instead of just water for flavour, and a little more carrot and celery. Quinoa has the most wonderful texture, i felt very well nourished by this dish.
