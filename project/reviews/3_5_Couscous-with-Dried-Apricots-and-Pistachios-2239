We love Moroccan, so this is a staple side dish in our house. If you think you'll have leftovers, I'd hold back the pistachios as they get soggy overnight. I recommend using the best ingredients you can get with this recipe -- you really taste the difference. We use a persian lime infused olive oil from Stonehouse Oils and it's the BOMB in this recipe.

I have made this recipe many times. It makes an excellent accompaniment to lamb or chicken. I agree with other reviewers to dice the apricots, and toasted pine nuts are a nice alternative if unsalted pistachios are unavailable. If you want to make this recipe ahead, just wait till the last minute to add the basil.

I agree with the other reviewer that the apricots should be diced instead of sliced. Also I think this dish would be richer in flavor by using chicken stock intead of water.

Very tasty, great when done even a day ahead. The only change I would recommend is to dice the apricots instead of slicing, especially if kids are eating it. The strips looked a little worm like!

What a wonderful way to use leftover couscous! We are having a picnic here today and I opened the fridge to find about 3 cups of nice, cold, tri-colored couscous (tomato, spinach and regular) Luckily I have Turkish apricots and garden fresh basil. I made this without the nuts :-( but it still came out very tasty. I am serving it with curried chicken salad and baguettes.

Very good. Has a sweetness to it. Would make a nice accompaniment for lamb. I used turkish apricots, rather than the tart American kind, and it came out really well.

I have made this dish on several occasions now and everyone who has tasted it, loves it. I have substituted toasted pine nuts for the pistachios and occasionally add a touch of tumeric to "oomph" up the colour a bit.

This was not at all what I expected, but we liked it anyway. I made it for a cookout, and the colors weren't great--the allspice and cinnamon make the couscous brown--but it was delicous. Easy, too.

Delicious, easy, a huge hit.

Dry, unsalted pistachios were impossible to find, so this took longer than estimated. Used dried peaches in place of apricots and halved the green onions, but doubled the basil portion for a lovely and light dish -- non-couscous fans really liked this!

Yummy! And so easy. I also added currents to the recipe. Also, I don't use the olive oil and the couscous still stays fluffy, not sticky. I had everything measured out in advance and saved in a ziploc, then all I had to do for my dinner party was boil the water - makes this a great recipe for entertaining. I served it with barbequed salmon and it was summery, yet satisfying and comforting.

I made this recipe for a special occasion and loved it. Instead of just adding apricots, I used the mixed dried fruit variety, with chopped apples, apricots, cranberries, etc. Once I cooked the recipe, (also added a dash of nutmeg), I stuffed the dressing inside (raw) cornish game hens. I cooked the hens with the dressing inside, and it absorbed great flavor. It turned out delicious!

This was really yummy! I made it for a potluck and doubled it and that makes a HUGE amount. I left out the basil and instead of the apricots I used the 7 oz. bags of Sun Maid Fruit Bits (already diced!) which have cherries, apples, apricots, plums, & raisins. Many requests for the recipe, will definitely make again.

I have been making this recipe since the 1996 issue that it was first published in. I just found it online now. This is a summer favorite in our house. It is really quick if you buy the already shelled pistachios that are now available. I made it for a block party and it was great because it could sit out without fear of spoiling in the heat. I highly recommend it!

YUCK! Cinnamon and couscous? I tried it but the cinnamon and the couscous just don't go together. The dried apricots lost their identity in the couscous and just tasted like stringy worms. The strong cinnamon flavor also overpowered the pistachios and totally wasted the taste of the fresh basil. It wa a noble experiment but I'll not make this one again. I find the most simple couscous recipes are the best.

The first time I made this, we were having vegan friends over, so we didn't know what to make. I found this recipe and it looked good so I gave it a whirl. This is now a meat-eater family classic. It's very filling and the combination of flavors is wonderful. Don't skimp on the cinnamon and wait til the very end to add in the fresh basil.

Easy and delicious. I did not wait 6 hours but it would be a great make ahead dish. It could be served to vegetarians.
