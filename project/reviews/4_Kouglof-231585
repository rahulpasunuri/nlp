A bit challenging to make without a stand mixer (I had to stop and scrape frequently to prevent the dough from engulfing my beater) but otherwise pretty simple. Mine rose to the brim in a warm oven in two hours. It was cooked at 20 minutes exactly. I used chopped dried cherries (didn't have any golden raisins) and brushed the cooled cake with orange blossom water before the icing sugar went on. It has a very light texture - kind of like pannetone, but not as dry. Local bakery does mini kouglofs (muffin tin?) - I might try that.

Perfect! I enjoyed this with a glass of Sherry from Spain. Kugelhopf can be googled online under images and you can see all manner of photos and recipes...a whole new world of wonderfulness awaits.
