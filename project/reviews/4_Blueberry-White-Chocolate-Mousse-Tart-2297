Great way to take advantage of blueberry season. Things I changed: Added a bit of cornstarch to the berries and cooked the berries for slightly longer. I also used 4-inch tart pans instead of a 9-inch pan. Was able to get six 4-inch tarts out of this recipe. Recipe was absolutely delicious and well balanced--even for folks like me who aren't white chocolate enthusiasts. Felt the amount of lemon was perfect and flavors complimented each other well. Dough was a little sticky but just required a little extra flour when rolling. Big crowd pleaser and beautiful presentation. Will be making again.

Made this for Christmas dinner since my husband was looking for something to go with a blueberry wine he got at our local vineyard. Since fresh blueberries were not in large supply this time of year, I used frozen blueberries, which worked just fine. This is a good recipie to use a variety of fresh fruit with. Had a bit of trouble with the crust - it was very soft and did not roll well. I wound up pressing it into the tart pan. This made the crust tougher than it should have been, but it turned out okay. Overall a nice dessert and very pretty presentation.

Wonderful and delicious!!! A great summer combination. I made it twice in the past month to rave reviews.

i love blueberries and i like lemon; not so crazy about white chocolate though i am a chocolate fiend. anyway, i followed the recipe to the letter, which, without a ton of experience in the way of baking or desserts, turned out to be quite an adventure. as a novice/beginning baker, this (in my opinion) is a LOT of work, and VERY time-consuming. i got to stiff peaks in the suggested ten minutes, but just barely, and i felt it in my arm the next day--and that's just halfway through! however, given my tastes above, i did find it to be COMPLETELY worth it in the end, and am looking forward to a real event/reason to make it again.

I used a very large shallow, fluted tart pan with a removeable bottom, I had to make more blueberries for the topping, since the pan was so big, but it came out perfect, tasted great and looked pretty as a picture. As an added touch of decadence, I made some whipped cream and added white chocolate and a tablespoon of grand marnier and put it in an ISI co2 whipped cream dispenser.

Fantastic dessert! I found the crust very easy to make and roll out and wouldn't substitute another.

A lot of work but well worth it! Four of us ate the entire tart for dessert! Next time I want to try fresh raspberries!

I used just the white chocolate filling in the "STRAWBERRY AND WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE TART" (Bon Appetit April 02) because I wanted a filling that didn't use raw eggs. This one was wonderful. It set up terrifically, had a great, light flavor, and excellent texture. Now can't wait to try it in this blueberry tart it was made for!

This dessert is awesome! I've simplified by using a shortbread crust! Super! It's often requested at our dinner parties!

the combination of the butter crust, white chocolate mousse and blueberries is sensational. I've made this recipe at least ten times. Everybody loves it. Great summertime recipe

This is an awesome dessert. It is time consuming but worth it. I used Frozen Wild Blueberries, and it worked fine! Would recommend!!! A++++

This is one of the most awesome desserts I ever made. It is simple to make, beautiful to look at, and unbelievably delicious. I will make it again and again.

I was very suprised that I did not like this recipe because I like to go by the opinions of other cooks. But I did not think the flavours blended well together. If eaten seperate they are good, but the white chocolate taste combined with the blueberries was not very appealing to me. Oh well..

This was a delicious recipe! The crust was great. The only minor modification I will make the next time I prepare this is reducing the amount of lemon in the mousse...it was a tad lemony... Overall - I'm glad I made it! It was easy to make, too...the most time was spent waiting for the crust to chill, freeze, bake, and cool.

This was a hit. This is easy but is very time consuming.

When I first made this, the store was OUT of blueberries. I substituted strawberries, and the result was delicious. The next time I made it I did use blueberries. But please don't ask me to choose a favorite.

Very nice "light" ending to any summer meal. My daughter loves blueberry desserts and this is her FAVORITE one. I have made it several times and it's always a hit.
