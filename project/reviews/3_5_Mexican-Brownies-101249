Forgot to say that I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate, and that was great. As others have already suggested, the topping is difficult to whip up but it doesn't matter, because it's delicious and firms up anyway. I had lots of topping left over so I would cut down the amount next time.

I love these brownies! The brown sugar frosting on top send them over the top. However, I would be careful about the baking time. In my oven I baked them 25 minutes and that was too long. Brownies are best when they're slightly gooey!

AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. I left out the topping and the brownies certainly didn't need anything it. I let them cool completely before attempting to cut them. I might try chili chocolate the next time for a little extra kick.

Sticky mess. Too sweet and topping was very liquidy. Not my ideal at all. Will skip this one.

These were probably the most delicious brownies I've ever had. I cheated and used a cheap boxed brownie mix instead of making from scratch, but they still turned out great. I just added 2 tablespoons of cinnamon to the mix and then proceeded as directed with the icing. Since I used a box mix which meant a 13x9 pan, I did not halve the topping and it worked out perfectly. I highly recommend this recipe.

These are really good. I followed the recipe exactly the first time but added 1/4 tsp cayenne for a kick - I also halved the topping and it was perfect. They got rave reviews. The next time I made them I only used 2 eggs which made the brownies denser and more to my personal preference. Perfect cinco de mayo party treat

yummy cinco de mayo dessert. i too was second guessing myself when i made the topping. and agree, now that i've made it, the wording is peculiar. it does thicken but not to the consistency of a buttercream type icing. and believe me, i tried! i whipped the crap out of it in my kitchenaid to no avail. anyway, you pour it on the brownies and it spreads quite nicely. i guess i have good cinnamon because one tablespoon was enough - you can definitely taste it altho not over powering. flavours together were lovely. next year i may try halving the topping as others suggest. the only change i made was substituting bittersweet chocolate for the unsweetened, simply cos i didn't have any. so i reduced the sugar by a quarter cup. very tasty. this will become an annual tradition.

Fun Cinco de Mayo goodie. thanks to the previous reviews, prepped only half the topping. A few modifications: walnuts instead of almonds, added cayenne to the brownie mix. yumm

This is a four-forks recipe because it was perfect for doctoring a brownie mix we had in our pantry. I added 1.5 tablespoons of ground cinnamon to the mix and made the topping with dark brown sugar and a full tablespoon of Mexican vanilla. It was excellent.

Rich and Delicious! If you want an authentic Mexican flavor, you should use brown suger, just cut the the brownies into small squares. I did the topping in the microwave. Watch it carefully and stir about every 45 seconds. Wording is peculiar--it does thicken a little as it cools and is easy to pour over the brownies and spread.

This was pretty easy and really delish. Based on other's reviews, I used the organic cane sugar (not as sweet), no chips, no topping and added walnuts. Really good.

Rating: 3
I've made these several times. I also find them to be a too sweet so I modified by swapping out semi-sweet chips for milk chocolate. And I made 1/2 of the topping rather than the full amount. That way you get the nice caramel on the top but the top isn't too thick and sticky. I also found it odd that this recipe doesn't have a leavening agent so I added 1/2tsp of baking powder (a similar amount is called for in most of my other brownie recipes). They came out fine, not too cakey.

Rating: 3
People liked them, but were critical. I found the criticisms hysterical, though: one person thought they were too sweet. Another, not sweet enough. Another, too cakey. Still another, too fudgey. I guess everyone's a critic. I personally like them very much. Did not make the topping because did not have cream on hand. Will try that next time.

Rating: 3
Made this last night for a party and got rave reviews. Some have commented here about how much cinnamon to use. The quantity of cinnamon specified here is correct, provided that you're not using months-old ground cinnamon you bought at the grocery store. I used Mexican cinnamon and ground it fresh, which gave a vibrant cinnamon flavor. Also, the directions for the topping are very badly written. I followed the steps to the letter, and never arrived at the texture they describe. I wound up rescuing it by making a cream cheese-based frosting and whipping the brown sugar mixture into it.

Absolutely loved this recipe. The only things i changed were...I used close to 3 Tbsp of cinnamon, 1 just was too weak for me. I say 3, but, I just kept adding more and more until it tasted alright. I also used semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate and they came out wonderful. They only took 30 minutes in my oven, and weren't fudgy, but, weren't cakey either. They were the best of both worlds. Highly suggest!

Perhaps I don't like the combination of cinnamon and chocolate, but I was very disappointed with this recipe. I absolutely love brownies and found these to be way too rich and dense. (I prefer a more cake- like brownie.) The topping was fine, but like others mentioned - a bit gooey. Too many wonderful brownie recipes out there to tinker with this one again.

Rating: 4
After reading the reviews, I found myself concerned about the amount of cinnamon as I tasted the raw batter, and about the topping being grainy and not firm enough to spread as I was putting the brownies together. After completion, all of my worries went away. I love the gooey topping, the cinnamon made a strong statement, and overall, the brownies had as much of an impact as any I've ever made. Perfect with a Mexican theme dinner. Of course they're really rich. That's why you cut them in 1/2 in. squares! I agree with using only good chocolate, but then again, that holds true for anything!

Very sweet! The brown sugar topping almost put it over the edge. However those with a serious sweet tooth couldn't get enough of these. The brownies are more cakey than fudgy and the chocolate chips and cinnamon add a nice touch.

I loved the "crack brownies" comment, so I decided to make them for a cinco de mayo party...my friends agreed that they were the most addictive brownies they had ever eaten.

I made these brownies for my fiance for Valentine's day and they turned out beautifully. I didn't bother with the topping. It didn't need it. I replaced the chocolate chips with crushed walnuts and almonds because I love them with chocolate.I also went a little easy on the amount of sugar and added 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder which made them ever so moist and fluffy. Overall they were a great success. Definitely make them again.

Rich and so good. Have over 30 brownie recipes in my "treasure chest," each just a little different and all wonderful. They welcomed the Mexican brownies.

I made these for a Mexican-themed birthday party and they are a great alternative to the usual Mexican desserts like flan and pastries. The topping tastes like dulce de leche and is really delicious.

Can't imagine making the brownie portion of this recipe, tasting it, and saying "I think it needs frosting." These are incredibly sweet and rich way before you put the topping on it. The topping is very good but way overkill. The brownies are delicious and I will make them again but will leave off the frosting (maybe cut back a teeny bit on cinnamon too). Were a big hit though - took them to a Mexcian themed concert in the park.

I have made these brownies since 1996. I've submitted them to local bake sales and sold out right away. I won my husband's heart with them. They are unique and a nice change from your regular, standard-issue brownies. Everyone is surprised by the flavor of cinnamon. I also doubled the recipe and made a round, double-layered birthday cake for my husband's birthday. I frosted and filled it with the brown sugar frosting and almonds. It worked out very well and was a big hit with my husband and our friends. Keep the slices thin though, because of its richness.

These were great-very popular. I served them to four of us at a party on Friday, and we ate thin wedges (I baked it in a round pan) and were a little overwhelmed by the richness. Cut them into tiny little squares for a big 4th of July gathering and they were gone quickly-they are very good. I liked the amount of cinnamon as written. The flavoring of the topping was great, though it was a little grainy.

I made these for a Mexican dinner get-together. Everyone liked them. I thought they were very rich, especially with the topping, which is overkill though a good combination of flavors. But, a scoop of vanilla ice cream evened things out...you might want to drizzle with Kahlua, too.

We had a Mexican potluck, and I made these for the dessert. I tried to make the brown sugar topping, but it crystalized and failed. So, I substituted store-bought cajeta (goat's milk caramel). I also used chopped Mexican chocolate instead of chocolate chips, and I used mexican vanilla (not quite the same as vanilla extract) and a pungent cinnamon from Penzey's spices. Everyone loved them!

Rating: 2
The actual brownie portion of this recipe was delicious, though incredibly heavy. I think next time I make these I will not use regular shelf cinnamon but something a bit fresher and punchier, as the flavor was almost entirely lost in the chocolate. I would also completely skip the topping and instead put the almonds directly into the brownies, it was soooo awfully sweet I was certain my guests were going to go into diabetic shock. I'll definately give them another shot. Another thing to remember, make certain that brownie is COMPLETELY cooled before attempting to do anything with it. Before it has cooled it has a fudgie, pudding-like consistency that is impossible to work with. So be patient.

I have been looking for this recipe for ages! I just want the others to know that I actually doubled the frosting recipe for one 8" by 8" pan. And added a whole bag of milk chocolate chips. These brownies are heavenly. I go into a daze when eating one. nobody is allowed to talk to me when I eat chocolate! just heavenly!!!! yum

I baked these last night and had doubled the recipe. When I tried one brownie last night at room temperature I felt that the cinnamon was overpowering, and since I had used semisweet chocolate chips, I felt they were way too chocolaty, if there is such a thing. So upon another sample this morning, I have to say that the cinnamon flavor seemed to have settled into the brownie and so did the chocolate. I didn't double the topping and I found it yields a large amount, for the double batch it was plenty, even still a little too much. For a single batch I think it would have drowned the brownie. However, I think the topping is deliciouse! It tastes like a soft carmel candy that never becomes hard. I can think of other recipes I would like to use it on. I baked the double batch for 39 minutes at 325 in a convection oven. It came out perfect, not too dry and not soggy. The texter is dense and rich. I only used a little of the almonds on one side of the brownies. Personal preference. I will make these again, but I think next time I will cut the cinnamon in half. I think these are definitely worth another try!

Rating: 4
These are the most delicious brownies and not a lot of work, considering they're not coming from a Betty Crocker box. My sister insists on sneaking in a few more heaping teaspoons of cinnamon, and they still come out incredible. Very moist, almost like a rich, dense fudge. (p.s., I skip the foil because it sometimes sticks to the finished product. I just serve them in the pan I cook them in. It's earthy, but effective.)

Excellent variation of the traditional brownie! I made this recipe for a mexican fiesta and my husband thought for sure I would bring the entire batch home because there was a table full of desserts.

To the reviewers who "cheated" by using a brownie mix -- the brownie recipe is the best part here. Extremely moist and dense, not-to-sweet which complements well the sweet brown sugar topping. And they were really easy. Just melt your butter and chocolate, add in the other ingredients, and voila! Delicious brownies. Also, my topping wasn't grainy, maybe it hadn't cooked enough? I let it boil for about 10 seconds before taking it off the heat. I also let it cool for more like 15 minutes -- it wasn't set up enough in 10 minutes. These were a great complement to a Mexican-themed dinner of shrimp and chicken fajitas and a garbanzo-chipotle side salad. Everyone begged to take home the leftover brownies!

This was fantastic. Absolutely fablous. However, I must admit, I cheated. I used a box-mix to make the brownies, and added a very generous TB of the cinnamon. I don't think it severely damaged the integrity of the brownies in the least, although I'm sure that if I had the time to make them from scratch, they might have been even tastier. Chilled the frosting for a little- didn't have any problems. If you're looking for a quick, easy and delicious dessert that's not run-of-the-mill, you really can't go wrong with this.

I found this recipe for a Mexican-themed party I threw last week. I baked the brownies and froze them, intending to make the topping closer to the day of the event. However, I ran out of time and ended up serving them "plain." My guests ate them all, raving over the cinnamon/chocolate combination. With the chocolate chips in the batter, they are rich and sweet without the topping.

These brownies would be good except that I overbaked them (my fault of course) but I could NOT get the brown sugar topping whisked "thick enough to spread". I use an electric mixer on high for 10 minutes and it was still just syrup. I know I had all the proportions of ingredients correct. I finally ended up just drizzling it over the brownies and it was pretty messy, but still tasty. I refrigerated some of the syrup and it got thick then, so maybe that would be an alternate technique.

Not a bad recipe, but I was dissapointed as choc & cinnamon are one of my favorite combos...Ended up throwing alot of these out as they were just too sweet for our family, which is saying a lot!
