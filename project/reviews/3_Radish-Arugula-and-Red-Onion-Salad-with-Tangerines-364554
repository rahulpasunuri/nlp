Decent easy salad, but not one I'll make a second time. Aside from using mandarins instead of tangerines, I followed the recipe. Although the textures and colors were lovely, the flavors were not zingy enough for me. The dressing was especially dull, in spite of being a lovely rosy tint flecked with red and orange. For me, the minced elements added little flavor (maybe I needed to add more of them, esp. zest), resulting in a dressing primarily lemon-olive-oil in taste--not bad, but not equivalent to the effort. As the first reviewer suggested, lime does perk it up a bit. All in all, I expected a very aromatic salad, punched up with citrus, sweet herbal-y fennel and mint, and sharp radish and arugula, but I ended up with something very muted and lackluster.

We had fresh radishes from our garden that I wanted to use. I did not have tangerines so I used Mandarin oranges. I used lemon zest in place of the orange zest in the dressing. I did not have purple onion so I used green onions for the dressing and sweet onions for the salad. I left out the fennel because I did not have it. I am sure it would add another nice dimension to the salad. However, I was very pleased with the outcome. I don't care for radishes much (my husband loves them). But I thought the salad was really good. Pretty salad would be great for a dinner party. Can be made ahead and add the arugula at the last minute.
