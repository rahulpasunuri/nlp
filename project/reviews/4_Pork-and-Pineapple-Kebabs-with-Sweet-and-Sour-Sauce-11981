delicious. added a bit of pineapple juice to marinade and only 4 hours of marinade made the pork tender and delicious. only need a bit of sauce to drizzle over finished kebabs.. it is pretty sweet sauce. great served with pineapple rice (with cashews) and/or stir fried bok choy with garlic (both recipes on epicurious.com)

This was a big hit - although it was too spicy for my 7 year old. Next time I'll set aside some sauce without the pepper flakes for her.

This recipe was delicious! The only variation was that we cooked the pork on separate skewers than the pineapple. We also added skewers of red, yellow, and orange peppers. The flavors were fantastic. The red pepper flakes added a little kick! Great recipe!

These were delicious and easy to make. I also added orange and red bell pepper pieces to the skewers. The pork I marinated overnight and it had a great flavor, spicy! Would make again for sure, yum!

Big hit with the (picky) kids. We used the ingredients to make a stir fry rather than kebobs, and added some broccoli and carrots. Used pork sirloin (cheap at Costco).

I really should have known better than to cook these kebabs as long as the recipe states. They were much too dry. I would suggest grilling for maybe 6-7 minutes total. It does not take long for one inch cubes of pork to cook. I didn't enjoy the sauce, either. I made my own from boiling 1 cup sugar with 1/2 cup water for ten minutes. Then I stirred in 1 clove garlic, 2 tsp. chili garlic sauce, 2 tbsp. cider vinegar and 1/2 cup apricot preserves.

It was a great combo of flavors - easy and relatively fast when you sub chicken breast for the pork, which cuts the required marination time in half. Make sure to use ripe pineapple - its disappointing to get that sharpness when you wanted sweetness.

Delicious! I made a separate batch of marinade for the pineapple, some green pepper, button mushrooms & baby onions that I yanked from my garden. I put only onions on the same skewers, only pork on the same skewers, etc. Also added some soy sauce to the marinade. Drizzled the sesame oil over all at the end only because i forgot to add it to the basting sauce. It was like a deconstructed Chinese sweet and sour pork,only much healthier. Husband loved it!

We love this recipe and have shared it with many friends. I add the juice from the cored pineapple to the marinade which really makes the meat tender. Great with an asian noodle salad.

Made these for a casual night w/ friends. Being as it is the middle of January, we did not grill outside, but put under broiler. Broiler method was just "ok," but the recipe is highly recommended! Very yummy - used fresh pineapple (much better in my opinion), and also used green and red pepper.... great color, taste, and ease! Will put on the list for this summer!

My husband and I love this recipe for a weeknight meal. It's nice and spicy and very easy to make. The marinade is super simple--I'll do it in the morning before work usually. Served over brown rice it's also quite healthy!

Rating: 3
This was my first time grilling pork... and the meat was extremely tender and the sauce was really good. I didn't give 4 forks only because I didn't get any heat from the red pepper flakes... and though it was still delicious... the hot would've been a nice contrast to the slightly sour pineapple and the sweet sauce. I would definitely make this again however (though would try another heat inducing condiment/spice) and it's a definite keeper for grillin'.

This was good, not stellar, but good. An easy weeknight meal, if pork is marinated the evening before. Next time I'd make a few extra skewers of just pineapple, it was so sweet and yummy (used canned chunks, too!).

Had this at my son's place. What a feast. Some day I will do it for us, though we are only two people, thus have to change the recipe somewhat.

A great pork grill recipe. Loved the sauce. Also did this with chops and it was just as tasty. I will make this again.

Woo, it's hot! But very tasty. I used canned pineapple chunks, which worked fine. I also used a broiler. This didn't take as much time as the recipe indicated, and the results were tender and juicy.

This was easy to make and excellent. The spicy-sweet combination was wonderful. I used a gas grill on med-high for 22 minutes and the pork was too well done. Next time I'll try a shorter cooking time.

I made this with cider vinegar. Is that distilled vinegar or should it have been white vinegar?

Disappointed by the sauce (too sweet). The marinade is a winner.

I was so excited to try this recipe and was very disappointed. Seemed to be a bad "Americanized" take of a great Chinese dish.I tried to convince my three year old that it was pineapple and pork with sweet ketchup and that's exactly what it was.

This recipe is worth the time! Tolerably spicy. My friends ask me to make it when we have a cookout.

Easy and very good! My 13 year old quasi-vegitarian announced that it was a keeper recipe on first bite and dibsed a second kebab. I served the pineapple/pork kebabs on a brown rice medley along with grilled miniature bell peppers. Really nice and easy for a weekday meal.

DELICIOUS!!! Quick, easy and SO good! My husband commented at least 3 times as he was eating how good it was. I only had time to marinate for 2-3 hrs and subbed a little cayenne pepper (abt 1/2 tsp) for the pepper flakes. The heat was just right. I also used canned pineapple and added some green pepper chunks. Although I changed some things, I feel I stayed true to the intent of the recipe and wanted those who may not have the exact time or ingred required to know that basic substitutions still yielded delicious results and to go for it! (They were done in 15 min)

Delicious. I forgot to put the red pepper in and am glad since my two-year-old loved these! The red pepper would have made them too spicy. Used lean pork tenderloin -- only needed to cook them about 18 minutes TOTAL. Will definitely make them again.

Rating: 3
I did substitute olive oil instead of sesame oil and it was fine. I think this is most delicious if you cook the tenderloin whole rather than kebab it. It is good either way though. This is my husband's new favorite pork recipe.

We loved these. I used cubed pork for "City Chicken" which may be a Pittsburgh-area thing. Anyway, it turned out great. I used half the amount of crushed red pepper, marinated for 12 hours and used wood skewers soaked in water. I don't have a grill, so I broiled about 5-6 inches away from heat source and they cooked in about 15 minutes.

I made this with cubed boneless pork chops. Instead of red pepper flakes, I used a Cajun spice mixture. Turned out just wonderful. I will definitely make it again.

I was really impressed with the boldness of the flavor. I didn't use red pepper flakes, instead I used a couple dashes of Tabasco Sauce. I broiled the skewers in the oven, and they turned out perfect.

This was delicious. I had a pork shoulder cut (bone-in) that I didn't know what to do with. I trimmed it and cut it into cubes and this turned an average piece of meat into a fantastic dinner. I did cut the red pepper flakes in half. My husband and I thought it was great but my 3 and 6 year old found it too spicy. Will definately make again.

Too spicy, and didn't knock my socks off like the other reviewers.

This is a definite keeper! I used chunks of canned pineapple. Pineapple here is like $5.19 It is a mouth watering recipe to share with your friends.

I just had to rate this recipe again! I made it for the second time yesterday..decreased the amount of crushed red pepper to 1/4 tbs (I halfed the recipe).. I made the full amount of sweet & sour sauce & I grilled them on metal skewers (which worked much better than the wooden ones). DELICIOUS!!! The pork wasn't as spicey as before - very very good!!! Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
A great and easy dish. I used boneless cutlets just 6 oz. for 2 of us)and added lots of vegetables along with the pineapple. I accidently tossed the marinade and basted with olive oil instead. This produced a much milder flavor.

This is one of the best things I've cooked off the Epicurious site. I made a couple of amendments to the recipe, though. I used pork loin medallions and grilled them (medium heat on the Weber gas grill after initially preheating to maximum)for 10 minutes turning every 90 seconds. I skewered the pineapple and grilled it for half the time so that it was still slightly al dente. I left out the salt in the sweet and sour sauce --the soy sauce has plenty, and halved the dried red peppers as suggested by another reviewer. Truly fantastic, and my wife deemed it guest-worthy!

Super taste! A nice dish but I found it bit too spicy. I would reduce the pepper by 1/2 in the future.

This was very good and so easy. Next time I would double the sweet and sour sauce for dipping. I also grilled zuccini and red pepper and then served it all over rice. YUM! My hubby liked it too.

This was the best, my two kids and girlfriend loved it. I use the Epicurious site all the time, I feel That I couldn't get along without it. Very simple to make, be sure to marinate the pork overnight. I used canned pineapple and put the juice into the sauce, and made it that much better. Served with Jasmine rice.

Outstanding! And like the previous reviewer mentioned, we had all the ingredients in the pantry. We used the full amount of red pepper flakes, and didn't think it was too hot - just flavorful with a kick. We served it with (GASP!) Rice-a-Roni fried rice and broccoli.

Delicious! These kebobs were amazing! I was a little put off at first because I am disgusted by the smell of vinegar, but these were worth the suffering! I made these for a get-together I had for some friends and was a little nervous - seeing I had never made them before. Everybody loved them! **NOTE** The pork seems to turn out a little better if you use metal skewers over wooden or bamboo ones.

FABULOUS! I DECREASED THE RED CHILI PEPPERS TO 1 TSP, AND MARINATED PORK FOR 24 HOURS IN THE FRIG. THESE KABOBS WERE EXCELLENT, NOT TOO HOT AND VERY FLAVORFUL.
