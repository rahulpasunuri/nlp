I improvised significantly, as is my wont and based on holiday leftovers. I had about two quarts of corn which I simmered with the onion, a hefty chipotle chili and 3 cups soup stock. My variations were roasting three red and one yellow and one orange pepper -- also left over from the holiday -- which I then pureed with half the corn and three cups of buttermilk, again left over from another recipe. The roasting effect was tremendous -- added another sweet element together with the corn against the heat of the chile. I simmered it slightly and then added minced fresh cilantro and basil -- more holiday orphans -- since I couldn't decide between the two. Rich soup with multiple flavors/tastes (but without the cream's unnecesary calories!)

i loved this recipe, I added some fresh lime juice for a little bit of freshness. I would recommend using the optional cilantro.

The smell alone deserves four stars. Delicious!!!

I'm incapable of following a recipe properly, so I added additional water, heavy cream, and an extra can of corn. I have to say that this corn soup recipe is the best one I've tried so far! I will definitely be making this again :) Next time, though, I might use fresh corn instead of frozen...

This was delicious with a heartiness and spice that is perfect for wintertime. I made some changes including no cream nor creamed corn. Instead I used what was left in my box of organic corn soup ( I was basically looking for something to do with the remainder to spice it up a bit and this was perfect.) I used half the water since I had the soup. I love spice so I doubled the chipotles. And I found of can of diced tomatoes with adobo that also provided nice roasted flavor. I didn't like the idea of the oregano and omitted it. I bought the cilantro but forgot to put it in. I am sure it would be great with it, but it was wonderful without as well. I made it for a starter at dinner the other day and have had it the last two days for lunch. Its quick and easy and pretty.

This is a fantastic soup. Instead of the chipotles, I use one cup of chipotle salsa (Frontera brand) and reduce the water to one cup. Excellent!

No fail recipe--some soups turn out bland and need lots of fiddling, but this is full flavored, warming, and has a nice bite. I use chicken stock instead of water and never use the cream corn--just canned fresh kernels or frozen--I prefer the texture that way. You can add a little cumin powder to round out the flavor if you want, but if you use the chipotle, cumin is not needed. I also do not blend my chipotle ahead of time, but use 1 canned chipotle pepper (1 tbsp), minced. It disburses well during boiling. All in all, a very tasty soup and a regular in my repertoire.

We have this soup, or a variation of it, quite often. It is an excellent spicy soup if you follow the recipe exactly as written. The soup has lots of calories, so we usually omit the butter, use chicken stock instead of water, and use only half the cream. Sometimes we add roasted vegetables (cauliflower is particularly nice). If we are feeling decadent, we add a cup of crabmeat.

This was a big hit with our gourmet club. Very fast and easy. I also omitted all the water, and used a bit less than 2 cups of 10% cream instead of whipping cream. Couldn't find chipotle peppers, so I added some Asian chile oil and some Tabasco smokey chipotle sauce. Will certainly make this again.

I didn't like this at all. I don't like the flavor of the corn with tomatoes. Also, with the whipping cream that is a lot of calories for something that is not very good.

Other reviewers are absolutely correct in their comments: decrease the amount of chipotle (I used 1 tablespoon and it was perfect) AND decrease the amount of water (I used 1 cup). Soup was easy to prepare with wonderful flavor.

I made this exactly as written, but I think I would decrease the chipotle chilies slightly or almost in half the next time. I do like spicy food, but thought that the chipotle would be more balanced in a lesser amount. I was somewhat reluctant to use the canned creamed corn, but the soup tasted fresh. Pretty quick to put together and a short cooking time make this an easy weeknight soup and a rich, hearty meal! This was a great mix of flavors and textures and I'll definitely make it again!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and got many compliments. I followed the recipe exactly and did not think it was too spicy. I loved the combination of corn and tomatoes. Delicious, thick and hearty, and very easy to make. I will definitely make it again!

Fabulous soup! I will make this again, for sure. I like thicker soups so I took the recommentation from others on cutting the amount of water to the extreme by not adding it at all. (I used just enough puree the chilies and that was it.) I cut the chili amount in half and it was plenty spicy for me. Definitely had kick, but I could still taste to soup - and had my tastebuds at the end of the bowl.

2 tablespoons of the peppers is way too much. One gives it a good kick. Also, I used chicken broth instead of water to make the flavor a bit more rich.

Definitely good. Be careful with the chipotle peppers, they are quite strong.

I love this soup! I've made it four or five times now. I add a couple chopped potatoes (prefereably Yukon Gold, in 1/2 inch cubes) with the tomatoes, and then I puree a portion of it before adding the frozen corn. It has turned out perfectly every time and is a big hit with everyone I've shared it with.

I'm learning to appreciate corn in dishes and love this soup. My changes are adding 2 Tblsp. flour,using 1% milk, and reducing the amount of chipotle. I like it as a creamy, spicy, vegetarian corn soup. Once, I served this as a first course to a Sate meal - my friends loved it mild. My family enjoys this as well. Adding Tabasco's chipotle sauce at the end can perk it up even more.

I made this for the first time tonight. I thought it was very easy to make, and both my boyfriend and I enjoyed the flavor. I did think the consistency was a little thin, and would probably not add as much water next time, or maybe not even at all as another reviewer recommended (perhaps just some chicken broth). I also only used 1 1/4 tablespoons of chipotle chili in adobo and it was spicy, but not TOO spicy. I think we could have handled the 2 tbsp. Next time, I think I will also add some shredded leftover chicken breast, and maybe one small diced potato, just for texture and umph! to soak up all that mild, but very good flavor. Good comforting dish on this rainy night!

Excellent recipe after substitutions - I used about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups chicken broth, instead of water. I also used about 3-4 tablespoons of diced green chilies out of a can (the mild variety), instead of chipotle chilies. The flavors were just right -- got some kick to it, but did not overwhelm the corn flavor. This turns out to be a very rich and chunky soup, so keep some extra chicken broth handy, in case your soup gets too thick.

This is like my mother made it, except for the chipotle chilies. Excellent soup. Thank You.

UGH! I love corn soup, chipotles, and Mexican food, but this recipe didn't do it at all for me. I expected something more like a spicy chowder - this was far too tomato-y. The chipotles completely overpowered the sweetness of the corn, and the dish overall lacks a good balance of flavors. I suppose I could tinker with it extensively, but with so many other great corn soups on this site, why bother?

Rating: 4
I love this soup! I used 2 tbsp of canned chipotle puree and probably could have used quite a bit more without making it too spicy. One other substitution was to use regular (not cream-style) canned corn with just a touch of extra cream. Also, the soup is just as delicious the next day.

I've made this dish several times and it's always a hit. I use vegetable broth and half and half. To store chipotle peppers, keep them frozen. Then when you need more, just chip off what you want and put the rest back in the freezer.

This is a great corn soup. I also used chicken broth instead of water, milk instead of cream, and I used a can of diced mild chilies instead of chipotles. I have a lot of recipes for corn soups, and this one ranks among the best.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful soup. It is actually worth 3.5 stars. I seeded the pepper before I added it to reduce the heat. Can anyone out there tell me the best way to store the remaining peppers? I moved them from the can to a glass jar, covered with the sauce. This is the first time I have used them so I am at a loss as to how long they can be refrigerated or, should they be frozen? Any help would be appreciated.

Great basic recipe...I also toned down the Chipotle peppers to 1T and it was plenty spicy! I also added 3/4t cumin, a finely diced potato, and shredded one bonesless chicken breast....subsituted evaporated milk for the cream...it came out great!! I would serve this to guests anytime!!

For those who don't know chilies, like me, chipotle is VERY HOT!!!!!! I wish I have read the comments about how hot it is. My husband who likes hot foods can't even handle the whole 2T. Next time will make with just the adobo sauce (the sauce in which the chilies are packed in). Otherwise, omitting the chipotle/adobo sauce will make this an ordinary soup.

Yummy, with a great corn taste. I used chicken broth in place of water and just 1 T. of chipotles, which gave it a good smoky-spicy taste without overwhelming the corn taste. I substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream; cream would be better, but then it couldn't be an everyday recipe for me. Next time I'll compenstae for the thinner texture of the evaporated milk by using only 1 cup of broth/water.

Absolutely loved it & have been craving ever since!I used chicken broth in place of the water & served it with crumbled corn tortillas & melted jack cheese on top.Was too spicy for several who sampled it -I would halve amount of chipotle next time -you can always add more heat to individual servings.

Rating: 3
Good--but watch those chipotles in the adobe sauce!! VERY HOT! (and I love spice!) Start conservatively, a teaspoon, taste, then another etc. Instead of adding cream, I added a big dallop of yogurt when serving. I also used roasted peppers which added a great smoked flavor

I thought this recipe was great. It was quick and nice and spicy. I followed the recipe exactly. We did have to add salt at the time we ate it.

This was disappointing. I thought I'd like it because of all the good ingredients, but it really fell flat. The only substitutions I made were using half-n-half instead of cream and crush tomatoes in puree, I don't think that is what did it. I ended up tossing the rest of this. I will be curious to see what others have to say about this soup.
