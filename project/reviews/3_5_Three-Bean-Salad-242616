This is a nice, light salad. I like the twist of serving the beans still slightly warm is different from what I normally do with a bean salad. Most notably, however, I cut the amount of oil in half and I still felt like it was too much oil. I also added some mustard I had in the fridge, a decision that gave the dressing more flavor. I'd recommend adding no more than 1/2 cup oil, if not less!

I made this last 4th of July and just came back searching for it. This was so simple and good and got better as the days went on. Weird, it is one of the only foods I have ever become "addicted" to and craved -- I was eating it by the bowl fulls for lunch a week after the party.I'll post if the same holds true after this July 4th week of party/guests.

This was even better the next day. I would use less oil next time. Also, I am new to cooking and would like to know if anyone has suggestions on how to make this easier. Would canned beans taste as good? I'm leaving the green beans out next time and replacing them with something else. I didn't like how they tasted in this. Any suggestions.

Very tasty, simple and versatile since you could easily switch up the combination of beans. The olive oil gives a richness that isn't overly heavy and the fresh squeezed lemon juice lightens up the flavor of the marinade even more. I drained off the excess oil/juice mixture after several hours and used it as a dressing for cooked fresh spinach, sliced tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. I also enjoyed the bean salad straight out of the fridge when I was too impatient to bring it to room temperature first.

A new summer staple. I made with with canned black soy beans instead of black eyed peas - it was an instant hit.

I've made this twice this week and is it absolutely delicious. My only changes were edamame instead of lima beans because I like it better and canned black-eyed peas instead of frozen because I couldn't find frozen.
