This is a wonderful recipe that surpassed my expectations. I used a mandoline for the fennel and shaved the cheese instead of grating it. . I will definitely be making this one again!!!

Very nice - important to serve chilled. Left out the cheese and added hearts of palm per other reviewers, also a bit more lemon juice. Refreshing and nice after a rich dish.

I made this the first time and because I couldn't find fennel, I used celery and it was good. The second time I made it, I didn't use fennel or celery - I added hearts of palm and it was awesome! I'm making it again just like that again this weekend. It was a big hit!

This salad is okay, but not particulary interesting. I actually preferred it without the parmesan. The salad reminds me of another recipe on this site that I prefer, and which is somewhat easier to make - Italian- Style Cabbage Salad

Excellent and unusual. I substituted artichoke bottoms for the hearts, and liked the texture better. Like other reviewers, I added a bit more lemon juice. Served with Italian bread and a very nice Chianti.

excellent! i made mine with a little bit of basil in addition to the italian parsley. also used shredded parmesan/asiago/fontina blend...i keep the salad fresh longer by not adding the cheese until i'm ready to eat or pack my lunch. thin slices of fennel keep them from overpowering the other flavors. a keeper!!

I made this for a Northern Italian style dinner party and it was so much better than I expected, simply delicious as is.

I wanted to try a dish using fennel and boy did I make a good choice using this recipe! Very good, I just squeezed in the whole lemon. My guest and my self loved it and no left overs. It was the starter for Blackend Ahi Tuna with a crab Bearnaise Sauce and Roasted Asparagus. Have Fun!~

Was excellent. I did not cut the fennel as thinly as I should have and added a bit too much garlic, and it was still a hit. Served with a mustard and mushroom chicken dish and couscous.

I agree with the cook from San Francisco - shaved Parmesan works much better. The first time I made this for a dinner party I wasn't sure if anyone else would like it, especially the guys, but it was everyone's favorite. I'm making it again tonight.

This salad compliments a chicken dish well-- I prepared it alongside a chicken with shitake mushrooms and it was great. I could also see adding cooked chicken directly to this salad for a nice summer picnic dish.

My brother-in-law ate this and liked it after watching me make it and commenting that he did not eat artichoke hearts! This was easy and delicious.

Excellent! Great combination of flavors and very quick to put together. Only change was adding more lemon juice.

This salad was phenominal! The crisp refreshing taste of the fennel and lemon was just what i needed on this sweltering day! I will definitely make this one again!

I don't see what's the fuss. I thought this was dull. Maybe if the dressing came out thicker and stuck better, it could have been great. I'll try it again sometime, but with modifications.

This is a phenomenal salad - I made it in under 20 min! It is totally savory and wonderful. I would make it again, serve it at a dinner party, make extra to put in the fridge....all of the above. Better than most fancy restaurant salads - FABULOUS!!

Delicious, easy to make and a nice change from the standard salad ingredients.

A really delicious and easy recipe. My only modification was to use very thinly shaved Parmesan instead of grated -- the shaved cheese looked prettier and went really well with the finely sliced fennel. Otherwise, this was pretty much perfect.

I've made this dish over 10 times since it was first published...always to rave reviews. Simple, healthy, perfect starter.
