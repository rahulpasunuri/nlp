So tasty and refreshing! I don't particularly care for blue cheese so I substitute feta and it is still to die for! Can't wait to try all the different variations suggested..Yummy!

I substituted chopped kale for the cabbage as a few of my guests do not eat cabbage. Salad well received by my guests and leftover salad was good too. I may tweak the dressing next time; adding more honey as it was a bit vinegary for my taste.

Absolutely delicious!!!! The only change I made was substituting dried cranberries ('tis the season) and adding bacon. Very good without the bacon though!

I make this salad quite often for family, guests and events - every time it disappears because everyone loves it. It is colorful, healthy and tastes exceptionally good. I would rate it 5 stars if I could. What is nice about this salad is that you can substitute ingredients: I make this with mango or with persimmons when in season. I use different pears and sometimes a mix of red delicious and granny smith apples. I always use pomegranates (I buy them fresh and after removing the seeds, freeze them so I have them all winter long). I also add baby greens sometimes. I make it with the cheese and without. It's versatile. Regarding the dressing, I find that olive oil is a bit too heavy for this salad so I use canola instead. Do not pour the dressing over the salad too far in advance as it wilts the salad quite fast. This is a great dish - don't hesitate; try it! It's a keeper.

Really good. A refreshing, colorful summer salad that didn't take that long to prepare. Didn't have hazelnuts, so toasted raw almonds. Couldn't find an Asian pear, so used a firm green variety.

Sorry, I was not a fan of this salad. I should have known better when I read the proportions of oil to vinegar and gone with my instincts. I didn't love the red cabbage in it, either. There are better salads out there.

Made this last Sunday and I'm craving it again. So delish, and different. My mango finally ripened so I'm giving it another go, with the mango. I'm still undecided about the pomegranate...we'll see if it's missed with this version.

Made the salad using hazelnut oil and raspberry vinegar and also used mango instead of persimmon. The recipe was one of the best summer salads I've ever had. Crisp, fresh, seasonal and a delight for the eyes. I expected a lot of leftovers with the guests, but every single shred of salad disappeared.

Very nice did not make with Hazelnut oil used reqular evoo. Did not use pomegranate seeds as out of season. Nice salad for the educated palate. Really enjoyed it!

Excellent. The flavors blend perfectly together. Didn't have hazelnut oil so I substituted walnut oil. This is a great salad to bring to a summer barbeque.

Awesome color and presentation. Taste is unexpected and surprising. Rave upon rave from South American dinner guests. Make often and omit whatever is not in season to avoid ultra expensive ingredients.

So, so good and so adaptable. I would love to try it with sunflower seeds, jicama, etc.

This salad is really good, but the dressing needs to be doubled, and then it was enough salad for 2 dinners for my husband and I. We substituted rice wine for red wine vinegar, feta for blue cheese, Bartlett pear for Asian pear, omitted pomegranate seeds, but added avocado, and it was great. I like it almost as much as the Layered Cobb Salad recipe on this website. Will make it again.

I tossed the fruit and cabbage in the dressing and served it over the lettuce with the nuts and cheese. Had a lot of the chopped fruit mixture left; we ate for breakfast the next two days and it was delicious! We'll make this again, great flavor and crunch!

I've gotten pretty picky about salads after finding an absoutely brilliant raw kale and radicchio salad on the Fine Cooking website. This one comes close and I can now see myself occasionally making something different which my friends and family will appreciate. :)

If you love salads you must try. We made this as part of our Oscar Dinner to represent The Kids Are Alright. Used a bosc pear and omitted the pomegrantes (couldn't fine).The texture, flavor and color were perfect. Wonderful dressing. We passed the cheese since some of our quests did not care for blue cheese. A wonderful year round salad. A must try

I loved this salad. The dressing is delicious and the crunch and color are outstanding. All the flavors come together beautifully. I've made it also w/ substitutions...firm bosc pear for the asian, and walnuts for the hazelnuts. I am a salad lover -- for me, sides and salads are the star of the show, and desserts and main courses are not as exciting. So for me, this salad rates 4 forks...it's exceptional. I might only give 2 or 3 stars to a beautifully prepared roast that others would rate a 4, because I'm not that into meat -- to each his own.

This was good, which is two forks. Pretty hard for a salad to earn four forks (exceptional) in my opinion. I'd like to respectfully request that we stop the "grade inflation" on this site and reserve four for the very best. The only thing exceptional about this salad was how very crunchy it was. Better on day two after it sat a little, which is unusual for a salad, I guess.

Made this for a book club dinner, and I thought it would be just OK, but everyone LOVED it! I tripled the dressing, just in case people wanted more (I tossed the salad with a little before serving), but had a ton left over. Surprising how good this was!

This is so delicious. I made it as is with the exception of subbing garlick for shallot bc that's what I had. I had leftover ingredients and am making it again tonight.

Fabulous salad. Beautiful colors and great textures. You might think it would be too fruity but the hazelnuts, bleu cheese and dressing balance the fruit flavors perfectly. Be careful with the proportions--the dressing is scant so if you make a little more salad you will need more dressing.

Used toasted walnuts, used balsamic for the dressing. It was so delicious that my hubby and I sat with a bottle of wine, 2 forks, and literally licked the bowl clean!

Excellent combination of flavors, crunchy and refreshing. Substituted pecans because I had them on hand. Served with honey-marinated pork with gremolata. Look forward to making both recipes again.
