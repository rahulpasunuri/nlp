Yum with following changes: - served open face on sliced baguette instead of white bread (2 baguettes total) - cut tomato to size of baguette rounds - garnished each one with chopped green onions - used honey mustard instead of dijon - also this recipe made way too much -- i would halve it

I made this into appetizer rounds by slicing a baguette, spreading with the mayonnaise mixture and topping with a slice of plum tomato. Sprinkled with a garnish of chopped green onion and parsley. Made a nice presentation at our Christmas party. It's like a blt without the "L". Yum.

This can be made into a pretty party sandwich by using quality bread and adding a touch of sprouts and a tomato slice to each small sandwich.

This was so simple and basic and yet the mayo topping adds just theright amount of zing. Excellent dish for a summer party!

The recipe was a hit. Light mayo, great smoky bacon flavor, with the fresh taste of tomato. Wonderful!! Change the style of mustard, add additional seasonings (ie.,roasted garlic), change bread type--a whole new taste!
