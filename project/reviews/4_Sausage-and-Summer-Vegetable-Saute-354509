This is a fast, great recipe for a weeknight dinner. I did add some garlic to the mix, and was glad I did. I thought the dill was a little overpowering, and will cut back a bit next time. Otherwise, fantastic! I used some garlic/tarragon sausage I picked up at the farmer's market, and it went beautifully.

This is quick, easy, healthy and delicious. I used frozen mixed veggies (corn, carrots, peas, green beans) for more variety and nutrients. I've used a couple different types of sausages. My favorite with this dish is bratworst.

Another great weeknight recipe. Used Sweet Italian sausage and served with fingerling potatoes. Husband scarfed it and he hates onions AND fennel (or does he?)

The combo of dill, corn, and fennel is amazing. The dish is crunchy, spicy, and delicious. I simply fry the sausage in olive oil, no water. And I leave out the tomatoes. I made a video of the dish for my blog: http://makeityourdamnself.wordpress.com (Sausage 'n Stuff)

This is one of those sneaky recipes. It seems too simple to be so good! My kids (3 & 5) love it, as do we!

I used chicken and apple sausage, already cooked...I added the sausage to the onion, fennel bulb and tomatoes and cooked it all at once - added shoepeg frozen corn and dill at last minute. Very quick and very good...will do it again!

Love it! I used chicken/apple sausage and the flavors were perfect for a great end of summer meal. I also thought that the dill worked really well with the fennel bulb so if you are not a big dill fan you might want to still give it a try.

Really an excellent (and quick!) meal. Sausage works well but so would shrimp/prawns.

This was super easy and unexpectedly good. Used frozen corn because it's winter, which worked out fine. Did not use the fennel as the smell turned my stomach. The tomatoes were tasty. Served with tater tots. Quick and healthy meal.

Just excellent, so easy and tasty. I doubled the tomatoes for more sauce and this won rave reviews served with simple baby potatoes and fresh green beans from the garden

Great and easy. Instead of pork sausage, I used chicken sausage and it was fantastic. Definately a hit!

Great flavor! Prepared it exactly as described. BTW - the recipe says it serves 4; I'd say it's more like 3 servings if this is the only dinner dish.

I made this one night thinking it looked passable and was easy for a weeknight meal. Well, it is simple, but also outstanding. The flavor combo of fennel and dill was just wonderful. This recipe has entered the regular rotation.
