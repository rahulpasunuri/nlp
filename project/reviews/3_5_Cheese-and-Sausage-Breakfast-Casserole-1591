This is a fantastic recipe! It has been a Christmas morning staple for years. I double the recipe, add sautéed sweet onions and mushrooms to the sausage. I also use a sourdough bread from our local bakery. There is never any leftover even with 2 pans!

This is a great breakfast dish. We have it every Christmas morning. I've found the best way to pre- prepare it is to put the bread, sausage and cheese in the baking dish and cover. Then combine all the wet ingredients and store in a pitcher. The next morning, simply pour the wet ingredients into the baking dish and cook.

This is a staple in my Fire Station. I double the recipe and I'm able to feed up to twenty hungry Firemen! Easy and Delicious

So easy and very good. The sausage and cheese you use will make a difference. For 4 of us, I 'sort of' halved the recipe from 8 servings = I used 3 slices of Oroweat White Whole Wheat bread, 1/2 package (4.8 ounces) Jimmy Dean fully cooked sausage links that I 'crumbled' in the food processor, reduced fat Mexican four cheese blend, 4 eggs, 6 ounces skim milk, 1 teaspoon of dry mustard and 1/2 teaspoon salt. I baked it in an 8x8 dish for 40 minutes. The result was perfectly done and very flavorful. You can certainly add other ingredients but this was good as is I did serve with chopped chives which I would add to the egg/milk mixture next time.

I love this recipe. I made it for Christmas Brunch and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I am wondering if anyone has tried to make it in a muffin pan? I think it would be great for a breakfast on the go or potluck idea.

This recipe is very tasty and very easy-a win/win combination in my book. I have made this several times and there is never any left.

Always a hit! Made in disposable foil pan. Double the bread (so you use the whole loaf), double the sausage (Jimmy Dean chub of HOT sausage and JD chub of low-fat sausage), small can of roasted, diced grn chiles, 12 whites & 8 yolks, 2 c. low-fat milk, 1c. grated cheddar and a variety of odd cheeses left over from Thanksgiving hors d'ouevres (mold removed). Keep out a handful of bread cubes to butter and put on top (thanks Colo Spr)....SIMPLY FABULOUS!

Rating: 4
Really good! I strayed from the recipe a little because I used baguette instead of white bread, and I used Gruyere instead of cheddar. I will make this again and may experiment with adding some veges next time. I think it is the mustard that adds such nice flavor to this. Unlike other breakfast casseroles that I've made, the balance between bread and liquid in this recipe was perfect. The only negative feedback that I have is the clean-up. My Staub pot, though greased, was a mess! Also, I'm not sure about this feeding 8 to 10 unless you're serving other things on the side. I am sure that it will re-heat well. Great recipe!!

Rating: 4
Great for Christmas morning. Instead of covering the bread cubes with the egg mixture, I place the bread cubes on top and brush on melted unsalted buttter. I follow the baking time but cover the top if it gets too brown towards the end of the cooking time. This makes for a great crunch with the creamy egg cheese mixture underneath!

I served this at a family brunch yesterday and it was a HUGE hit! I did, however, add my own "touch" that was delicious. In addition to the sausage, I sautéed one onion, and package of sliced mushrooms. I also added a small can of minced, green chiles. I served the whole thing with various salsas, sour cream and my favorite guacamole. Excellent. i was asked for the recipe by all the women there!

Rating: 4
Added 5 hatch green chiles and 1 onion (diced) to the sausage while it was browning. Also I always deglaze the sausage pan at the end with a little white wine and let it cook off before i add the sausage, onion and chiles to the casserole pan. I serve with fresh salsa and sliced avocados as accompaniments. Delicious!

used non fat milk and mushrooms, everyone loved it. I would guess it would come out great with low fat cheese and turkey sausage

This was a great, and super simple recipe! I made the entire thing in advance on Christmas eve and just popped it in the over Christmas morning. It smelled great cooking and set up perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. It tastest like a quiche but isn't nearly as time-consuming to make.

A New Year's Day favorite. I use a box of Pepperidge Farm seasoned croutons instead of bread (don't use extra salt if you try this) and lowfat or nonfat milk works just fine.

Rating: 3
This is one of those recipes of which a variation can be found in every school and church recipe book and it's very good and reliable. I like the dried mustard in it and always use lowfat milk anyway. Great meal for when guests are in town and you want to spend time visiting in the morning, since you put it together the night before. Also easily adaptable - I always add roasted green chilis and more cheese, but this time I also added sauteed onions and peppers. You can also serve it alonside refried beans, flour tortillas, and chili sauce and eat it burrito style.

Rating: 4
This is such a great recipe! so delicious, simple, quick, and very flavorful. I think it would be great with practically any kind of cheese, but we loved it with gruyere, and we also used hot italian sausage. We'll definitely have it again on Christmas morning, and then the only thing I might throw in are a few diced tomatoes and scallions but the recipe is really just perfect exactly as written.

This is a great standby recipe. Many stratas are too wet, dry, or get overcooked. The ratio of milk/eggs to bread in this was just right. I also added sautéed onion, mushroom, small green pepper, and garlic.

I made this dish for Easter weekend, and it served four people for breakfast for two days. It was easy to make and delicious. After reading some of the other reviews, I agree that sauteing some onions and garlic (and mushrooms if you like them) with the sausage would be great. I followed the directions and used whole milk, which turned out well.

Very good. We loved it according to the exact recipe. The only change I made was to use a sourdough boule and cut into 1-inch cubes. It requires a few addional eggs, but worth it. Next time, and there will be a next time, I may take advice and add onions and/or green/red peppers, for flavor and visual appeal. I may also mix the sausage into the bread cubes and then put the cheese on top.

What a huge hit! My son brought home half his fraternity (actually just 5) and I made this. Easy and quick. Didn't have cheddar so used Swiss, Parmesan, Romano and American, just cleaned out the cheese drawer. Sauteed onions and garlic in butter along with the sausage. Will probably add red pepper flakes next time.

Rating: 4
Four forks for three reasons. First, it's tasty (must use sharp cheddar to achieve that result). Second, it's versatile - I added red peppers for colour and used turkey sausage to serve for friends keeping semi-kosher, great results. Third, it's a perfect night-before make ahead dish, and there aren't that many good brunch casseroles fitting that description. Great stuff.

My mother has a very similar recipe she calle "Christmas Morning Casserole." It is so easy and very adaptable to change...it will be fine if you use 8 eggs instead of 10, eggbeaters instead of eggs, and throw in leftover asparagus or onions. I sometimes use spicy sausage instead of regular, and usually use the reduced fat sausage. It is sooooo easy, and perfect for making the night before, hence perfect for Christmas morning when you want something special but easy, or when you have a brunch such as a baby shower or family get together.

i made this for a teachers appreciation luncheon and got great reviews. the next day i wanted to make it for my family but did not have all the ingredients. i used maple bacon instead of sausage, and used sour cream and a bit of skim. i added chopped mushrooms, arugula, and tri color peppers....it was delish!

I made this to take up north for a snowshoeing weekend. So easy to make the night before and just pop in the oven. Next time I will add spinach as suggested by another reviewer and maybe some onions...although one of the people on our trip is allergic to onions so didn't add this time. Will definitely make this again. It's a nice change from my usual blueberry french toast casserole.

Absolutely delicious. It's just as good (cheaper and EASIER) than the Cowboy Christmas Breakfast on this site, with a lot less hassle and effort. We just placed whole slices of bread on the bottom of the dish and did away with cubing it. The kind of recipe that is great on its own, but could handle tweaking depending on what you have on hand.

So easy and always good - my go-to recipe for brunch. It's ideal for cooks who can't/won't follow recipes in the morning. Perfect to bring to a tailgate (morning or mid day game) or to have when guests stay over (I am not a morning person). I make mine the night before in an 8x8" pan (same cook time but it's taller/fluffier) and then cut into 9 pieces. I'd like to try different variations (lower fat, southwest, veg/mushroom) but haven't ventured there yet.

This is really good. I added a bit of chopped up broccoli and mushrooms and it was a wonderful dish. I was skeptical when I first put it in the oven because it did not look very appetizing but when it was finished I pulled it out of the oven and my guests were oohing and aahing. Very good!

This was fabulous. I only had one hour to let it sit in the fridge and our brunch guest arrived late so I had to leave the cooked casserole in a closed oven for over 30 minutes but it still turned out delicious! I added mushrooms, onions and extra cheese (cheddar & swiss). I didn't have bulk sausage so we cut up cooked veal sausage. I used whole grain bread instead of white, more flavourful. This is definitely a keeper!

This was very simple, very tasty, and it serves 8 people fairly well as a side, and more like 6 generous servings as a main dish. I unfortunately was short one egg, but it didn't make a difference. I made it about 2 hours in advance, covered it, chilled it, and baked it as directed and it came out hot, bubbly, puffy, and creamy. There was a tiny bit left over and my husband reheated it in the microwave and said it was just as good the first time around. I will make this again and will definately add mushrooms or perhaps other omlette-inspired fillings.

With all respect to R. A. Street, my aunt published this recipe as Sausage Egg Souffle with slight differences in ingredient amounts in the "Southern Sideboards" cookbook in 1977. Where she got the recipe, I don't know, but this has been a family tradition for a generation. We always prepare it the night before to allow the custard to soak the bread then pop it in the oven the next morning. Delicious!

This is a wonderful, kid-friendly dish that everyone will love. I used it with cubed french bread for Christmas morning. Today I'm preparing another for New Year's Day. I love the ability to make it the day ahead and then bake when ready. Not a great dish for reheating, though. May half the recipe for less than 8 to 10 people.

I made this for my family on a Sunday morning and was a hit! It's so delicious that I made it a couple more times during the summer. I also did a half recipe and used a 7x11 dish instead and cooked it for about 30 minutes which turned out great. I also would recommend preparing all the ingredients the night before (like the recipe says) so the bread can soak up the ingredients and make it even tastier.

So easy...I read other reviews and got great tips on how to "flavor up" this incredibly easy recipe....For the sausage I used "Jimmy Dean" sage flavor. Substituted sharp cheddar cheese with "Kraft Classic Melt" shredded cheese mix (this is a 4 cheese combination of Wisconson sharp cheddar, Vermont white cheddar, American, and Monteray Jack). Instead of white bread cubes I substituted with "Simply Potatoes" southwestern flavor hash browns...(sauteed and stirred til golden in left over sausage oil for about 6 mins) .. The recipe remained simple and quick but added a slight kick to the end results....very tasty

So easy, so delicious, and easy to "customize". I prepared ahead and refrigerated it overnight. Turned out better than expected. Used stale sourdough and it fluffed up nicely. Next time, I will add some diced red peppers or mushrooms to liven it up. If you're going to be cooking for a crowd and want something extremely "low fuss", this is it.

I made this for Christmas morning and it was a HUGE hit. I substituted shredded hash brown potatoes for the bread and my family loved it.

This has become a staple dish in our house and I have made many variations. I love it with chorizo for a Mexican version, with salsa and chilis mixed with a little sour cream...add some black beans (canned) if youve got them and this dish is a winner. For Christmas morning brunch, I make an Italian style casserole, by adding sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, shallots, garlic and topping it with cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan. Delish!

This dish really doesn't need another testimonial yet, here I am. I made this for an office breakfast retreat. It got rave reviews.

I wasn't sure what kind of bread to use and ended up using Wonder Italian (with the crusts trimmed. Simple and delicious!

Excellent with lots of compliments from brunch guests. Really liked the fact that I could make it the night before as I'd rather mingle than cook. Made the sausage version as called for and a veggie version with mushrooms, marinated artichoke hearts, and green onions. Was surprised to see the veggie version was a bigger hit!

It's really good - just as written. The only minor changes I made were that I used French bread instead of white and put sliced jalapenos on half of the casserole. Those were both nice changes. I did kind of wonder how much bread to use because the recipe calls for 8 slices of white, but I just kept cutting cubes until the bottom of the pan was covered. That did it. There was not a bit left after brunch! YUM!

Very easy. Used wheat bread instead of white but if I were making it for a party I would def. use white. I think it needs 12 eggs instead of 10. You do need all 16 oz of sausage as well. Also, I was afraid that if I poured the eggs on before I chilled it that they would separate. However my mother said that the bread wouldn't soften if I put them on at the last minute. I decided to do them last minute anyway and they were perfect.

This is a really reliable recipe. My in-laws were in town for the weekend, and it made it so easy to prepare breakfast in the morning since all the work was finished the night before.

Made this for Mother's Day brunch. It turned out very well, and the leftovers held up well too. This is a heavier dish, so don't expect people to take large portions.

I made this recipe exactly and it was good. I also followed a variation of this recipe similar to a chorizo and chili strata.

This was amazing!

I LOVE this recipe just as it is, comes out PERFECT every single time. One of the beautiful aspects of this dish is that, like other reviewers have expressed, you can really play around with it and jazz it up. We like very spicy food so we usually add chopped Poblano or Anaheim pepper, chopped fresh jalepeno peppers and some chopped red pepper. When we're feeling really decadent, we use half & half instead of the milk. There have been times I have even made it with 1/2 crumbled bacon and 1/2 spicy bulk sausage...delish! This is a real crowd pleaser, easy to make, and can be made the night before, taken out to bring to room temperature and popped in the oven. FOUR FORKS!!

I have not tried this exact recipe, but I have one similar that I make all the time. But over the years I have fiqured out that Eggbeater type eggs bake much better than fresh eggs. No soggy eggs when I use Eggbeaters. Or just replace a few of the eggs with a carton of Eggbeater.

This has become our traditional Christmas morning breakfast - mostly because I can prep it the night before!

I prepared this dish the night before a Sunday brunch and thought the results were just OK. I followed the instructions as is and got soggy results.

I've been making this recipe for the "guys" at work and now they have a collection cup for me to make it every week (they pay me to make it!). I've read all the suggestions and in the end have mastered it using spicy croutons instead of the bread, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of chunky rotel tomatoes...I've also been adding green peppers and onions to the sausage and using sage sausage. I have gotten nothing but great responses and would recommend this recipe to anyone :)

This was VERY good - took it to an Easter Brunch and everyone loved it. I used hot Jimmy Dean sausage and think that helped add some flavor. I also added some green peppers.

The casserole required more cooking time that the recipe says, probably because I had put it into the oven almost directly from the refrigerator.

This was an easy crowd pleaser. I reduced the amount of bread to six slices, added peppers, onions, and mushrooms, used half spicy sausage and half regular, and DID use lowfat milk, which didn't seem to be a problem. I also baked it for over an hour, and the bread wasn't soggy at all.

A sure fire brunch/breakfast pleaser. Have made it four or five times. When I entertain I don't want to spend alota time in the kitchen so the advanced prep aspect of this makes it perfect. Depending on how much time I have I have thrown in fried peppers, mushrooms and/or onions. There are never leftovers.

Wonderful recipe - I've used it for Xmas morning for over 10 years. My family WON'T let me try something new. I do add some chopped onion, and red and green peppers for a "holiday" look. Using spicier sausage is good too for a second dish for the more adventurous eaters.

I made this for my family Christmas brunch. It was a huge hit with every one, especially me. I made it te night before. It was delicious, simple and very little effort. I did not have sage saugage but I sprinled the sausage with dried sage, also cooked some chopped onion with it. Yum!!

I used seasoned croutons instead of the bread for fear of it becoming soggy. I think it had the opposite effect as it was very dry. Maybe I let it cool too much and then reheated it in the microwave to warm.

I used herb seasoned croutons, and lots of an herb seasoning mix. For added texture and flavor added diced peppers and onions and olive oil to sautee. This was delicious and got rave reviews from all who had it at potluck brunch.

My sister's in-laws have been making a version of this recipe for years. The only difference is that we make it up the night before and store in the fridge overnight. I have never noticed that bread makes it soggy - maybe this is because of soaking overnight. Also, I recommend using a very peppery sausage for more flavour.

I've made this casserole for several years for our Christmas Day breakfast -- it baked while we opened our presents which was so much nicer than having to go in and start making breakfast from scratch. I like it better with the bread stuffing cubes instead of bread - not as soggy - and you can make it with turkey sausage, skim milk, and low fat cheese -- it will work! I plan to try som of the variations the others readers suggested!

Using the advice from others, I skipped the bread and used a package of O'Brien potatoes which I cooked for 10-12 minutes in the oven to reduce the moisture (and let it cool). I also used Aidell's new breakfast sausage which is precooked and all you need to do is slice it! The only other addition was some crushed red pepper flakes. Assembled the night before and popped in the oven in the a.m. Great company food (especially for those going to a Rams game and need something in their tummies before tailgating) and my coworkers enjoyed the leftovers which came out fine in the microwave. Would definately make this again - maybe with the bread but the potatoes were so good...Made again with tater tots, no sausage and layered with sauteed onions, red and green peppers, mushrooms and spinach. I cooked the tater tots approx. 10 minutes and let cool. I also added some sliced tomatoes before the eggs and cheese. This is so versatile and everyone asks for the recipe. I actually cooked this the night before and cut squares to bring to work for our breakfast and it microwaves just fine. Cut more squares the next day and was still fine. My co-workers love my leftovers! Try this you won't be disappointed in any variation!

Okay, I haven't baked this yet but wanted to comment before I forget what I did with the recipe. I'm making this for a friend's birthday brunch and she doesn't eat meat. I carmelized onions and added the mushrooms with a bit of butter, thyme, sage and red pepper flakes and sauteed until juices from the shrooms evaporated. I charred two red bell peppers on the stove, peeled and chopped them and added them to the egg mixture with the salt and pepper. I'm using harvarti cheese that I froze and shredded in my processor and will bake in the morning. I'll tell ya how it turned out tomorrow.

Could not imagine why anyone wouldn't like this dish. It's easy and delicious - plus you can make it look prettier if that's important to you. I used Jimmy Dean's sage sausage - the sage added great flavor. To dress up the dish you could garnish the top with fresh sage as well. Also, make sure you use EXTRA sharp cheddar for taste, and preferably white for looks. Finally, I bought nicer "bakery" white bread from the grocery store, and I think that probably helped the flavor and texture out too.

I haven't made this version of the dish, but I have had a lot of variations of the recipie, both good and bad. My mother makes an excellent version and her secret is to substitute a box of Pepperidge Farm Onion and Garlic croutons for the bread and use the really spicy (italian?) sausage and make it the night before. It is much better that way, and has some real flavor.

Yuck. Way too bready- maybe should have mixed in eggs better? No flavor. Not worth the effort- guests who are good friends- thought english muffins, with eggs and sausages would have been better.

I've made this numerous time with rave reviews. It has a custardy texture, so not as dense as quiche. Instead of sausage, I add ham, onions, tomatoes, chives, mushroom, red peppers and whatever types of cheese I have. Great way to use leftovers. The bread cubes completely disappear, unless you don't cut the crusts off. Seems to take more than an hour, but I added a couple extra eggs.

Made this recipe for my husband's work and everyone loved it. I eat very little meat, so substituted Morningstar Vegetarian breakfast patties for the sausage. It was delicious w/o all the fat and by products you get in meat sausage. Everyone was very surprised that this was a meatless dish! Adding other things might make this great recipe even better, so I'll try it again w/onions, chiles, etc. next time. Lower fat, kcal & Yummy all at the same time!

This did not meet my expectations. It had too much bread, even though I only used 6 slices. I would not make this again. I also thought it could have used more seasoning even though I increased the spices.

Everybody absolutely loved this recipe! The only change I made was I added 1 small onion (chopped up and lightly browned) along with the sausage. Great flavor and very easy. I made it the night before and popped it into the oven the next morning - in exactly 50 minutes it was perfectly done. This recipe would work very well with veggies too.

This was great....My better half loved it as well. Instead of bread, I actually used frozen tater tots (which I cooked for 10 minutes before adding the eggs). I know this sounds weird, but was very good! Also, I seriously recommend adding wostershire sauce and chopped onions into the egg mixture (adds great flavor). This dish was great for our News Years brunch and will make again!

I have used a recipe similar to this one in the past and employed some of my earlier additions this time. I had ham so I used that instead of bacon or sausage. I added chopped mushrooms and a can of green chiles. I used multigrain bread and placed it in whole slices in the bottom of the casserole. I used garlic oil to prepare the casserole. I followed the advice of others and used egg beaters for six of the ten eggs. I also used reduced fat cheddar which was okay, but I wouldn't do that again. I think that this recipe lends itself to many possibilities such as sun dried tomatoes, green or red pepper and red onion. My guests enjoyed it and it can be reheated which my husband appreciates.

This is a good foundation for building a breakfast casserole. Fancy or not, nearly everyone enjoys this "gut bomb". I added lots of other ingredients based on the recommendations of previous reviews. I added both browned sausage, and crispy bacon, sautéed garlic, red and green bell peppers, leeks, and Monterey Jack cheese. Instead of the bread (I am allergic to flour), I used frozen shredded hash browns which I precooked in the oven for 10 minutes or so, to help evaporate some of the moisture. This came out very well. Don't be afraid of the fat. It's the carbohydrates we should really avoid! Serve this with light fruit, like strawberries, and melon. The amount of protein in this will keep you satisfied much longer than all those breakfast breads, or cereal. My family loves this one. I would even add some Jalapenos to it if I knew folks enjoyed a spicy dish. The basic recipe is rather bland.

When I made this casserole and the Hash Brown Brunch Casserole from this site for a breakfast we hosted for a large group of relatives, my husband said "it isn't fancy like the food you usually make." Ouch!! However, he and the relatives devoured every bite of both casseroles. Actually, I have to agree with him....this is not a dish you would make if you are going for impressive or elegant, but it is quite tasty (if fattening!) and a great solution if you are feeding a fair number of people for breakfast/brunch and don't want to spend the whole morning in the kitchen preparing individual omlettes. If you really have a crowd, try making it along with the hash brown casserole, fresh fruits and a coffee cake, scones or muffins. Your guests might go into cholesterol shock, but no one will go away hungry, and you will be able to enjoy your party instead of standing in front of the stove. If anyone knows of other nice brunch recipes to feed a crowd (fancy or not!) I would love to hear from you. Thanks!

Made this Christmas Eve when my husband and I had been snowed in for 6 days. Had to use what was in the house: added a sauteed onion and 2 cloves of garlic, a 4oz can of green chiles, a chopped portabella mushroom, and laid 6 slices of Pepperidge Farm thin white bread on the bottom. It was excellent! Even substituted Gimme Lean soy sausage for the real thing and still loved it. A great start to our white Christmas. Will definitely make it again!

Great recipe as written, and very adaptable. I also like it with chopped red peppers, green onions, green chiles and hot sauce added (leave out the mustard with this version), or with mushrooms, green onions and bacon instead of sausage.
