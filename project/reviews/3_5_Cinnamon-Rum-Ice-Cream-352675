The ice cream was delicious and easy to make. It's a perfect match for any desserts that go with cinnamon -- like maybe some fall apple confection! I used Original Myers Dark Rum and didn't think 2 Tablespoons was enough even though I don't like rum or boozy tasting food. I would add an extra tablespoon next time. Maybe this dark rum is a little more mellow than say using Bacardi Dark. I served it with the Rich Chocolate Cake with Salted Dulce de Leche and Hazlenut Brittle also found on this site. Divine.

Incredible. Resist the urge to amp up the rum- 2 Tbsp seems miniscule but it packs the perfect punch. Use the very best quality cinnamon that you can find- I used Saigon cinnamon and 2 tsp was the perfect amount. My 12 year old said that this was the best ice cream that he had ever had- reason enough to make this again & again. The texture and flavor are truly divine. I can't wait to substitute this for whipped cream the next time I make a pie- which will probably be next Thanksgiving.

this is the best custard-based ice cream i've ever made, by *far*. the texture is superlative. i'll use it as a base from here on. that said, we didn't think it was cinnamony enough; the rum flavor was perfect.

My family LOVED this ice cream. We doubled the cinnamon to really amp it up. Served this with a chocolate bread pudding for our Thanksgiving dessert.

i loved this ice cream! I made it to go with the apple tarts but i thought it was just as good on it's own. It would be good over an apple crisp too. I didn't find the texture grainy at all. I used Whole Foods' Whole Pantry Vietnamese Cinnamon (ground). Maybe that matters.

I made this last night, to accompany the Golden Delicious Apple Tart that I'll be making later this week,which is also on Epicurious. Though the two aren't paired up just yet, I think this ice cream will accompany it well. The rum flavor comes through quite clearly, even at just two tablespoons -- any more would send it over the top, and give it a marked alcohol taste -- it's pushing the limits as is. The cinnamon, as mentioned in the recipe description, doesn't add enough of an odd texture to be obtrusive -- although with cinnamon, you can't completely escape a certain amount of "toothiness" to the minute particles -- that's just it's nature. Overall, this ice cream is nicely balanced, and has a good texture to it for its genre. However, if you're not a fan of extremely "custardy" ice creams, this may not be for you.
