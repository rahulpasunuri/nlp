This is a really great recipe. My roommate facebooked that it was probably her first "foodgasm." I did not have the clam juice so I upped the worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and salt a bit and I really like garlic so I added another couple of cloves and it was fantastic. Dont think I would have changed anything if I had had the clam juice,though. Don't forget warm crusty bread to soak up the sauce!

With just a few changes, I transformed this into a tasty Asian stir fry. Sauteed zuchini, peppers & onion before cooking the shrimp. And do take the reader's suggestion to use the peels for stock in place of the clam juice. I added a tiny bit of Bay seasoning. Oh, and used brown sugar and kicked it up to 2T. Served with brown rice, it had a great kick to it!

I wasn't really that impressed with these... Too much work for a not so great result. I didn't think there was enough of a BBQ flavor.

This reminds me of New Orleans BBQ shrimp (which also has nothing to do with a grill) except without all the butter! My family loved the taste and I loved the calorie count!

is it just me, or is the recipe title bbq shrimp? when you read the instructions, the recipe has nothing to do with a bbq....

My true test of a recipe's quality is if I make it more than twice. I've made and eaten this dish many times now so it must be four star item in my book. We've made it for parties of all kinds and people always rave. My husband made it last night for a mother's day super with some crusty warm bread (for dipping in the sauce) and a green salad with toasted goat cheese and pecans and I couldn't have been happier (well except for when my toddler went to bed...). I add an extra tablespoon of tomato paste and one tablespoon of water. Delish!

My only change was to add less worcestershire sauce (1/2) My friends raved about it and it was not spicy! Just enough pizazz to make it great!

I thought it was delicious, easy to make and awesome. I'm frugal though, save your money on the clam juice, take the shrimp shells, a celery stalk, a little onion and parsley, simmer that for 30 minutes and use a cup of that instead.

I expected more from this recipe. My husband liked it, but I wasn't impressed. It didn't taste that great and the sauce looked boring.

I've made this recipe twice now. The sauce is perfectly spiced. I've even made it for friends and everyone raved about it. I will make this again and again.

This was such a winner!! I didn't think I would have enough for my guests once I said to my teenagers, "Try this." I even put a small portion away on the counter for me later and someone ate those! Very easy to make, not very spicy if you follow the recipe, and I thought the aroma was nice.

The aroma of this dish while it was cooking was a real turn-off. The sauce was hotter than I cared for & I didn't think it had a good flavor at all. My husband didn't care for it either.

I made this recipe for a small gathering of friends. It was divine! Just enough spicy heat to make it exotic! the only thing I did differently is substitute vegetable broth for the clam juice, as I am allergic to clams. They have already assigned me to make these for the New Years Eve party!
