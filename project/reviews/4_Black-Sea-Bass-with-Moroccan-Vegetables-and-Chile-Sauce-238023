Do not forget the feta. It is pretty bland without it (which is what reminded me that I forgot it)!

This recipe is bursting with flavors. I think using an expensive sea bass would be a waste with this recipe due to the complex flavors of the sauce. I have made it a few times, this last time with tilapia, and it turns out perfect. The best part is that you can throw everything in 1 pan in the oven and it bakes in the yummy sauce. Once you get all of the veggies chopped, it's very easy.

I was really impressed with this recipe! Could not find bass during the time that I made it, so I used cod and it worked just fine. I wish I had made more sauce, since my "meat and potatoes" husband enjoyed it but said the veggies didn't get enough sauce and he loved the flavor so much. I think I'll also chop the veggies a little smaller next time to make the sauce less chunky but that is a texture preference. The roasted veggies could be just about anything, I'd actually like to try potatoes and tomatoes next time or maybe squash - whatever you like for veggies will probably work if it roasts well. Yum! Would make this for company.

I didn't have fish, so I used chicken instead. I also didn't have pine nuts or leeks, (and used canned whole tomatoes since I was out of fresh!). Can you believe even with the substitutions it was incredible? We will definitely have this again! It is a full-flavored dish that even my little one year old enjoyed. We used a very nice basil feta, which tied the whole dish together (and we agreed is an absolute must!).

I made this just as the recipe called, except omitted the dill because I don't really care for it. It was delicious, and my veggy-hating boyfriend couldn't get enough. Passed this along to some family members, and I will definately make this again.

This dish is very healthy and filling, but it's a bit bland. I used fennel rather than celery and haddock rather than sea bass but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. A good feta makes a major difference.

The prep time is a bit lengthy, but the flavors are fabulous - use chilean sea bass if you can afford it.

This dish was really good, served with couscous and raisins. Yum! The vegetables could have cooked for longer. I used cod filets and the dish tasted very nice.

I thought the flavor of the sea bass was amazing! Definitely one I will do again soon!

Wow! I can't believe how filling and flavorful this dish was. Even my very active hungry husband was stuffed with just one serving of it. I could only finish half of one! Next time, I'll use 4oz fillets instead of 6oz. Also, we used top quality feta, which actually seemed to make a big difference. This is probably not a recipe for the kids.

Since nobody else reviewed, I feel compelled. I didn't quite have the ingredients, so for veggies I used celery, red bell peppers, tomatoes, zuccini and chives. Cooked it all together with spices. But didn't have allspice so used cardamom, cloves, cumin and cinnamon instead, in addition to curry. And yeah, didn't have broth, so just skipped it - it was more like side of veggies than sauce. Having said all that - it was still surprizingly good. I had my doubts about feta (that I did have) but it does work very well with this dish.
