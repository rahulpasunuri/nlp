I haven't tried it yet, planning on it tonight. I typically don't try recipes with such varying reviews, but you all have me so curious. Drama at epicurious, haha!

I had a big bag of left over pheasant hind quarters left over (the legs are tougher and sinuous so I thought they might be stewed). I changed this dish thusly: removed thighs from legs, seasoned with salt and pepper, browned in a large heavy pot and removed. Added a bit more olive oil and sauteed the veggies a few minutes. Added a tbs of tomato paste and cooked it down until the paste clumped up a bit. Added some white wine and a spash of vermouth, then chicken stock. Added browned bird bits with some fresh rosemary. Cooked until bird was falling off bone. At the end seasoned "expertly" with good quality sea salt and ample amount ground pepper. Result, a rich dish with layers of flavor.

While apprenticing in several kitchens, the recipes always ended in "season expertly". You have to take responsibility for seasoning and tasting your food. Too many variables to make precise salt requirements. Unless you are baking, recipes should be considered a guidline to the finished product. The method and food combinations in this recipe are great!

Again, what a meal, many years, yet not tiring of it. I use a larger hen, 7 to 8 lbs. Great with a Cote du Rhone. We love this comfort meal. Watercress must be organic though.

This was really good! I agree with the "Chicken Empress." As for all those people who keep saying how bland, insipid and uninspired this dish is, all I can say is...SALT!! There are only 1.5 teaspoons of salt called for in the entire recipe (which may be a typo)--yes, there are two tsp.s of rinsed capers in the sauce, but that is not nearly enough to add flavor. What about the cooking broth? I wonder how many people used low-sodium or sodium-free stock? Probably most of them; please add some salt before complaining about a recipe (and not Morton's table salt--buy some kosher salt and toss the table salt). I think I used a good extra two or three tablespoons of salt added to the cooking stock, and then a hefty addition while I was emulsifying the sauce (oil requires A LOT of salt)--which also got some extra blanched garlic. And to the person who looks for their own reviews, and then has to blame the moderator for the disappearance of their note, instead of just time moving on...please keep your vanity to yourself--and remember to salt!! Cheers!

My husband said this dish makes me the Chicken Empress, a promotion from the Chicken Queen. The next time I make this, I will either double the chicken or halve the vegetables and green sauce. I also used 2 cloves of garlic in the sauce.

to all those people who feel offended by the disappearing reviews. first, we should make it short and to the point. second, i think theres' only so much room per recipe for reviews, like only so many can be in along w/the recipe, and when the number is reached any new review will delete the earliest one. i doubt the people who monitor the website have the time to go around looking for remarks they don't like.

Wow! I wrote the original message about a year ago and came back to see what happened (just bored one day). Either way, I was appaled to see my post deleted. I did not utilize profanity or any other types of disrespectful language. I thank some of the reviewers here for backing my right to critique a recipe, as this web site's function is to allow fellow cooks to exchange ideas. I do not always write scathing reviews, just on real bad recipes such as this one. Yes, radioactivity may be a little flamboyant, but I was trying to get a point across. I hope this website upholds the integrity of sharing good, clean ideas.

I am an experienced cook and had high hopes of this recipe from reading the article, but we were very disappointed. I found it very bland. But the broth has proved useful.

I found this dish plain and uninspired. I practically doubled all the herbs in the stock, and the chicken was indeed nicely moist and flavoured with thyme. Although the green sauce was excellent (I'll make it again to serve with chicken and/or fish), it couldn't save the fact that this dish was just plain, unadorned chicken and vegetables. Too labour-intensive for the result.

This is a delicious, basic recipe for everyday cooking. I used arugula since I have that in my garden instead of watercress and used it sparingly. That adds a lemony zing. The chicken was flavorful, tender and I had plenty of broth left over to freeze. Please people, show some class and stick to the point in reviews!

FYI, this site will delete a message if it contains filthy language. I emailed Epicurious with such a request and they took care of it.

Surely a big city like Edinburgh has a decent market that carries hydoponically grown items like watercress and mache. It can't really be nothing but hagis and salt cod, can it?

This is not very good. The watercress sauce was bitter, as promised - who the hell can get "hydroponic"? The broth was good primarily because it starts off with canned broth. Parsnips, new potatoes, carrots and leeks have very different cooking times, and I don't find that parsnips or leeks respond very well to boiling anyway. The parsnips do add a nice sweetness to the broth, though.

Just a comment regarding reviews - the only way to 'delete' a post is for the original reviewer to try and post a new review. Only 1 review is allowed per person (or per email address I assume). If you try and post a 2nd review, the first will be automatically 'dropped'. I would assume the cook from 'Atlanta' actually changed his/her posting and is not owning up to it!

Just a comment to Nevada City - I don't think the website people delete negative reviews. There are way too many flaming posts on this site that stay there forever. The original author might have decided to either change his original post or delete it entirely. I think the integrity of the website is safe....

Nice change of pace for chicken. I omitted the potatoes as we are watching the carbs. Served with a nice reisling. Family liked the broth too, but were resistant to the low carb bread. Watercress sauce was great. Will try on Salmon.

I have made lots and lots of epicurious recipes,but lately I find myself coming online to see the reviews because I am enjoying them more than the recipes.I have a great laugh at all the nasty remarks etc. Keep them coming!

This is a traditional chicken stock and doesn't smell any different than any other chicken stock. Maybe Atlanta's chicken was less than fresh. The watercress added a wonderfully fresh flavor to the dish. Would definitely make again.

IT IS COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL TO HAVE DELETED A REVIEW OF A RECIPE, HOWEVER SCATHING. TO CREATE DISTRUST IN SUCH A SYSTEM IS SELF-DEFEATING. I AM DISAPPOINTED. I WILL THINK LESS OF THE REVIEWS IN THE FUTURE.

Aw come on!! Who deleted Atlanta? I want to read a stinging review.

A nice dish on a cold winter's night. Made it for my husband and friends and all enjoyed it. Not a flashy meal by any means, but good classic "comfort" food that healthy too.

Wonderful, sophisticated dish! Too bad, not all can appreciate.... It is light tasting and the chicken is so tender. This is a fine recipe for this classic, French dish. Don't let the negative reviews steer you away. I would bet they never even made the recipe. It is an excellent dish, try it - it is one of my favorites!

I am looking for 1/2 a fork. I don't know how this recipe ever made it to the internet. Take it off please..I'm trying to save the next poor victim!!!!!You ever heard the saying..."Don't try this at home"?

Atlanta - what do you think made this recipe smell so bad? When I look at the ingredients they seem like common soup or stewing items.

A lot of work but then again if you truly enjoy cooking and trying different recipes it could be considered a "labor of love". Hey! Atlanta! I never realized that to be a "food critic" you had to be completely insulting! Maybe you didn't succeed in mastering the dish? Otherwise the aroma would have been tantalizing! What happened to "if you can't say something don't say anything?"
