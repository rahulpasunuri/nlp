Very tasty! I used 1 cup of whole greek yogurt and 1 cup mayonnaise and doubled the remaining ingredients. They were just enough to fill an acorn squash once. Served with baby carrots and red,orange & yellow peppers, this made a beautiful crudite display. Don't forget the salt & pepper. A bit of salt in this recipe brings out the sweetness of the dip.

Too much mayonaise the first time. The second time I drained 2cup of fat free yougurt through a coffee filter. Then, I added 1/2 cup of mayonase and the onions the mint and champagne vinegar. This is great with all sweet veggie as a dip.

I didn't take the other reviewer's comments seriously enough- WAY too mayonnaise-y, even though I only used 2/3 c. and added a full cup of yogurt. I tempered it with lots of pepper and lemon juice- still, not worth making again.

The squash adds for beautiful presentation. It can be a lower fat dip -- I used non-fat yogurt and low fat mayo. I think I may add more yogurt and less mayo in the future. It would also be an excellent sandwich spread...

A refreshing and tasty alternative to other mayo-based dips. I, too, thought the mayonnaise amount was a bit excessive and used a little more yogurt instead. Worked nicely with asparagus spears and radishes alongside the carrots.

I'm going to use one red and one green pepper rather than the squash for Christmas. It will be another good seasonal presentation for this great recipe.

Great do-ahead dip. Pretty color to be served in the acorn squash. I used low-fat mayonnaise for a healthier version and it was delicious.

Maybe you should store ALL your leftovers in acorn squash!

I really liked this but must recommend extra mint as that made it more special and flavorful. FYI: I tried this with other crudites but didn't like it as well as with the carrots.

Very good. Sorry to disappoint and not leave a catty remark. Another idea to add zip if you find it dull is to try using a flavored vinegar. I used rosemary vinegar and it was great.

Golly, didn't realize tupperware was declasse in Palos Verdes. I suppose leftovers are stored on the best china? But hey, nice presumption that Alabama = can't afford acorn squash and doesn't have a nice bowl for the dip.

Wow! I used a whole cup of mayonnaise as well as the acorn squash and it got raves! I did however, add additional raw vegetables.

i can't believe all the ire a squash and a simple dip stirred up! especially the tupperware comment! maybe the person in alabama was thinking more about wasting food than a dollar. and if you don't want to use that much mayonaise, use more yogurt or try something fat reduced. and if you think it's bland then add some minced green onion or lemon juice or something. i thought these reviews were supposed to be written in a spirit of helpfulness not hostility.

An entire CUP of mayonnaise. You have GOT to be kidding.

Please keep in mind that this recipe is from Bon Appetit magazine. Half of cooking is about presentation. Use your head. If you don't want to use an acorn squash to hold the dip, then don't.

Hey alabama, don't spend the dollar (or less) on the acorn squash, put it in an old tupperware container- That ought to look GREAT on the table.

Actually, I just tried it at a friend's Halloween party and it was perfect... and the acorn squash really worked with the Halloween theme. I'm going to make it myself!

Let me get this straight. I'm supposed to buy an acorn squash for the sole purpose of using it as a bowl for the dip?
