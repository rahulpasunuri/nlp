Absolutely awesome and just stunning on the plate! The flavor belies the simple preparation. Can't wait to serve it to our guests.

This was really incredible. So rich and interesting, I almost forgot everything else I served with it. I have never had endive, and I would definitely make it this way again. I couldn't help thinking, however, that it could probably be made with less butter.

This was spectacular for such a simple preparation. Served it for Christmas Dinner with fillet of beef and herb roasted potatoes and it was the hit of the meal. On my hit list for sure.

I love endives, and this was simply delicious. I served it alongside the mushrooms and poached eggs from the same issue - YUM!

This was an excellent way to eat endives. They were full of a creamy orange flavor with a nice crunch from the bread crumbs. I used panko for lack of a baguette, and I didn't have the Chinese five-spice powder, so I just sprinkled clove and cinnamon over the panko before broiling.
