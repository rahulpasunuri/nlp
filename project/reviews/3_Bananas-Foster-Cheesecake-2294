We really loved the cheesecake. I changed the crust to a cookie-based one. 2 cups of cookie crumbes (I used chocolate wafers, but graham cracker or other would do), 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar. Combine and press into spring-form pan. Bake at 375 for 8 minutes, then add cheesecake mixture.

Made this for a party with friends...way too much effort for a desert that tasted like mushy banana bread...would not recommend this recipe.

This recipe was excellent. I made it in two shallow pie plates, which gave a better filling to crust ratio. I also tweaked the topping a bit, and it turned out wonderful.

Warning: The Bon Appetit version of this recipe (I have the cookbook) calls for 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, not a tablespoon. Very good in water bath!

I made the crust and the cheesecake as instructed, but left off the topping in favor of real bananas foster topping. The crust was absolutely amazing and perfect. The cheesecake was a little too banana-y and had a strange texture for cheesecake. If I made it again, I'd try one less banana and maybe that would fix both the texture and taste problem. It's edible, and you'll like it, but it's not an "OMG, I'm going to eat ALL of it!" recipe.

This cheesecake came out looking beautiful -picture perfect. I might not add as much mashed banana in the recipe as it was almost too much banana flavor since you serve fresh sliced bananas on the top anyway. It might taste better as a plain cheesecake with banana. Still, it is a very good recipe. I would make this again.

My teenage son made this and WOW, all the ladies at work and at his school are wanting more. I cannot get enough of it. The only minor change he made was to add about a tablespoon of carmel to the topping mixture. I have no complaints.

After eating a similar cheesecake at a very reputable resturant, I was so happy to have found a recipe for one. I tried this for Thanksgiving and I am so glad that my mother had also fixed some dessert items because this was awful! It tasted like mushed up bananas. There was no cheesecake taste at all. The crust was decent, but that was all. It failed in comparison to what I expected. I would not even attempt to doctor this recipe up and try again.

Don't make this expecting the richness and consistency of cheesecake, but do expect a less heavy treat! Made this for my boyfriend's b-day...he loved it stating it really tasted like Bananas Foster. I made a few changes to try and get closer to the actual thing! The crust was the richest part of the cake, but definitely added to the flavor. I grinded Archway Windmill Cookies (wanted molasses flavor), brown sugar, butter to form crust -toasted chopped walnuts glazed with butter and brown sugar sprinkled on bottom of crust with higher concentration around the edges; baked at 375 for approx 7 min. Added 8oz of fat free crm chs, used Tubinado sugar (only 1 cup)to get the molasses flavoring in the filling without being overpowering, used 3 tbls flour instead of cornstarch, only 1/2 cup of sour crm, and instead of lemon juice - used the zest of one small orange and one lemon, used 1 3/4 teas vietnamese cinnamon (has a richer concentration of oil)and added a 1/2 teas vanilla and 1/4 teas nutmeg to the banana puree. Then lightly shaved whole cinnamon stick on top. Baked in water bath at 500 for 12 min then 250 for about 1 - 1.5 hours. For the topping I cut bananas lengthwise (brushed with lemon to keep from browning) arranged in a "fan" on top and drizzled with a syrup of brown sugar, butter and dark rum. The cake had great presentation with a delicious flavor! I already have a request to make this for Thanksgiving!

i made this for my friend who is a huge bananas foster fan. for the first dinner party she came to, i made bananas foster, then bananas foster cake for her birthday, then this cheesecake in celebration of her upcoming nuptials. this, by far was the richest and extracted the most oohhs and ahhs. (it goes a LOOONG way though. there were 4 of us, and i still have 3/4 of the cake left.) it does require quite a bit of work (i was up until 1 am, then had to set my alarm to wake myself up at 3, so i could refrigerate the cake, but that's my fault i started so late), but it's nothing complicated and, in the end, worth it. couple things i did differently - i used dulce de leche (instead of caramel sauce - you can get it at any latin specialty food store, or in the ethnic aisle of your supermarket), added a little half and half, and added the rum to that. i used walnuts in the crust instead of pecans (for whatever reason, pecans are hard to find in queens, new york). and, i used a food processor for all of the prep instead of a mixer. i just tossed all of the crust ingredients together into the processor and tada! done. i rinsed it out and mixed up all of the soft ingredients as per the recipe. you might have to transfer some of it to another bowl as it gets pretty full, but i just poured the batter into the mold with the bottom of the cuisinart still attached. anything i can do to lessen clean up time! anywhoo! enjoy!

Although it looks great(I loved the ladyfingers around the edge)and tasted good -- I don't think I would make it again. Too labor intensive. I would suggest the Banana Bread Pudding with rum sauce instead!!!

Anyone who likes bananas or cheesecake should stay away from this recipe. The cinnamon was too much and inappropriate for this dish. The baking procedure was time consuming and not worth the effort. And the overall taste and texture of the dish was disappointing for me because I love both bananas and cheesecake. The rating system of this site is also misleading. One fork is supposed to mean the dish is "so-so" according to the rating chart, but I wouldn't even rate it that high. I consider my one fork rating to mean that this is a poor recipe.

This was the perfect ending to a delicious New Year's Eve dinner. Everyone loved the cheesecake. It had a great flavor and texture and was just the right amount of lightness. I used only 1/2 cup of the light sour cream in the filling and in the topping, I use 1/2 cup light sour cream with 1/2 cup fat free sour cream. I have made this many times before and always had the problem of soggy crust (which we ignored since we enjoyed the cheesecake filling so much). But this time it came out great... this time, I wrapped the springform pan in double thickness of heavy duty aluminum foil and for the first time, I prebaked the crust for 6 minutes. The crust was perfect! This is not your typical cheesecake. But if you want a delicious dessert with less calories and fat, this is a good one.

If you're expecting cheesecake, you'll be disappointed, but this is an excellent PIE. Cut the recipe down and use a 9-inch pie pan instead of a springform pan. It's always a hit when I serve it this way. We use Mrs. Richardson's for topping and omit the rum.

The cinnamon is really over powering, the second time I made this cake I used much less. The initial run tasted more like a very rich pumpkin pie than a cheesecake because of the spices. It's a very different kind of desert, if you're up for an adventure, give it a try.

Not good at all. Go to cookinglight.com to find a good low-fat cheeseckae WITH flavor.

everytime I have made a cheesecake in the past that says to wrap the pan in foil and place in a water bath, I have had soggy crust. This time I'm not doing the water bath route and I'll let you all know what happens!

There are much better cheesecake recipes than this. I prebaked the crust and it turned out great, but the filling was very bland.

Use less cinnamon or none at all. It competed with the other flavors too much. This wasnt very good. I'm a cheesecake lover and this was just kind of blah and mushy.

There's better cheesecake recipes out there, like the English Toffee Cheesecake and the Mocha Orange Cheesecake. If you absolutely love bananas, then try this one. The cinnamon is a little too strong, so I would decrease that. My crust also came out a little soggy. I've never had a soggy crust on a cheesecake before. I think I would use softened butter in the crust instead of melted butter, and would bake the crust a few minutes prior to adding filling. The caramel sauce is the perfect topping. Served most of the sauce on the side. Used banana rum in the sauce and it was great.

Good taste, and easy to slice, but a little bit heavy...but maybe because I used a food processor instead of mixer, and over mixed it(?). Did not taste "lowfat"!

My crust was a little soggy. I think I will bake the crust for about 10 minutes next time I make this cake, before pouring in the filling. It was delicious

This cheesecake was so yummy!! I would use only half of the cinnamon required. It takes a little extra time but well worth it.

Delicious and simple!! Rich & delicious even with low fat ingredients. Instead of the topping suggested in the recipe, I made a real bananas foster...melted butter & brown sugar in a pan, cooked sliced bananas in it for a few minutes, added rum, and flambeed it. I served the cheesecake with a generous bit of this on top. Guests were VERY impressed on two fronts: 1) delicious cheesecake and 2) the beauty of a flambeed dessert.

This was the best dessert I've ever made. I used regular cream cheese and sour cream. I also used candied pecans. I got rave reviews! Well worth the extra effort.

I made this for an additional Christmas Eve dessert. It took a little longer than other cheesecakes but the end result was worth it. The carmel rum sauce really added to the flavor and presentation. Very rich and creamy. It presents nicely. My guests all loved it.

If you love bananas foster, this is a dessert for you. Took longer than an average cheesecake to make, but worth it, I think. Definitely does not taste low fat.

My dinner guests truly enjoyed this cheesecake. I thought it tended to be a little bit too sweet, so I would suggest that you don't use overly ripe bananas for this recipe. A great visual dessert, but it doesn't stand up to other cheesecakes or variations of cheesecakes that I have made in the past.

This was a fun cake to make. You didn't notice anything low-fat about it. I shared some with my neighbor who told me two days later that it was so awesome she ate the entire plate (3 huge pieces) herself and the husband and kids didn't get any!
