I have been making this tart since it first appeared in Gourmet Magazine, July 1992 and have always received rave reviews. The mint cream complements the fresh fruit perfectly! A few suggestions - use non stick foil to line the crust when baking it for the first 15 minutes. Also, the pastry cream is very thick after refrigerating for 4 hours - use an electric mixer and beat it until it is smooth, then add your whipped cream in the 2 batches as directed. If you follow the directions as they are written, it should turn out perfectly!

I was surprised to find that the flavor of this tart really fell flat. The mint pastry cream lacked depth. The best part about this dish was the fresh berries I put on top. Usually when I put this much work into a baked good I expect the taste to be exceptional, this was just boring. I am glad that I decided to try it before bringing it to a Memorial Day BBQ. I would not make it again.

Delicious but very time consuming, even with the premade frozen crust that I bought. I probably wouldn't make it again except for a truly special occasion. Be very careful when heating the pastry cream. I'd recommend bringing it only to a light boil, and it's absolutely critical that you stir constantly while it simmers for 3 minutes. Also, I'd recommend using either a fork or a very small wire whisk so you can stir into the bottom edge of the pan; otherwise, the mixture may begin to cook and solidify there.

This tart shell is the best: delicious, sturdy (it won't get soggy), and laughably simple to make, especially for someone like me who's genetically preprogrammed to botch anything involving a rolling pin. The mint cream is light and refreshing. A perfect summer dessert!

I am only reviewing the crust. I also had trouble with it sticking to the foil after first baking period. I may have used a bigger tart pan (I didn't measure) thus it was too thin. It started to come apart, so I just left the foil on for the final 10 minutes of baking AND left it on until it was cool. It peeled off easily then. I just sort of placed the broken layer back on before my own (thankfully thick or it would have leaked through) filling. Texture and taste were very good, though!

I put a thin layer of melted dark chocolate on the crust before adding the cream and berries. When you bit into it you got the chocolate with the mint cream. It was extraordinary!

Wonderful recipe with potential for variation! Instead of mint - lemon, raspberry, vanilla, white chocolate.....Great cookie crust. Beautiful presentation.

Despite the many rave reviews, I found this just okay. The crust was crisp, but it stuck to the pan and was very hard to slice. The filling was much too thick to incoporate with the whipped cream - too much cornstarch? \

this was my first tart, and it went over very well. it was for a mint theme dinner. i wasn't crazy about the mint cream, it was good, but i don't think it added too much. the crust is awesome, agree it tastes like a sugar cookie, and i also glazed the berries with apricot jam. and yes, the pastry cream looks like yellowish green goo, esp after the fridge, so i also used the electric mixer on it to get it going before adding cream.

This tart was delicious! While it set up a little oddly and it was extremely hard to "stir" and "whisk" after it had been chilling for four hours (I paniced just a little bit), it still turned out wonderfully and was quite a crowd pleaser! I would definetly make it again, though it is frustrating that it really does take a day or two of cooking.

My mom used to make this for my father all the time. She has not made this in years. She gave me the recipe and I made it for Father's Day. I compared the recipe to the original 1992 magazine with the tart pictured on the cover. The recipe in the mag calls for 1 cup raspberries and that is all I needed. I think it is a mistype here on the website. There is not enough room for another cup of berries. Anyway! YUM!!

Fresh and delicious. I made this for a bridal shower I hosted. Fortunately, I made another dessert because the tart slid off of the pan bottom and on to the floor as I was getting it out of the fridge. I left it on the counter, and my guests proceeded to demolish it, knowing it had hit the floor. THAT'S a good dessert.

This tart is amazing! However, I did have some difficulties with the shell as it stuck to the aluminum foil after baking for 10 minutes. I think that maybe this was a result of overprocessing it, which resulted in a ball of dough rather than crumbs.

Amazing dessert! Fresh and rather light, considering the creamy filling. Everyone loved it!

This was surprisingly easy to make and tasted delicious. I will definitely use the crust recipe for other tarts / pies.

I loved this recipe, but I'm tempted to add peppermint extract to the cream sauce - it didn't have a pronounced enough mint flavor. The crust is incredible and easy to make - I'd consider substituting it for any other tart I make. I struggled with the cream sauce - once it was chilled, it was difficult to work with, even with an electric mixer - it softened with the addition of cream, but it ended up having a tapioca-like texture which didn't seem quite right. I would definitely make this recipe again, taking special care with the cream mixture.

This tart was AMAZING...I made it for July 4, and everyone loved it---every bite was gone! Definitely be watchful of the pastry cream--like other users have said, it thickens REALLY quickly. It actually looks like a big blobby greenish-yellow science project. But don't fear, the whipped cream creates a great color and really lightens up the filling. Perfect for a summer dinner party! The crust was fantastic as well...like a big, tasty sugar cookie. YUM.

I made this for an elegant summer dinner in the garden and the results were fabulous! The mint adds such a surprisingly subtle and interesting twist and the crust is the best (and easiest) I have ever made! I glazed the berries with some melted apricot jam before serving and the tart glistened. As per other reviewers, the pastry cream is gloppy when chilled, but it lightens nicely when the cream is folded in.

I've had this dish when other people have made it and it is fabulous! Tried to make it on my own tonight and I'm not sure it's going well. The mint cream is chilling now but it's a gelatonous blob - is it supposed to be? And what color should it be? I'd expect green, but mine isn't. Any advice, please?

Made this today and wasn't impressed. The creme was a gelatinous glob for most of the preparation - thick doesn't even begin to describe it! I definitely got a good forearm workout whisking it though. THe creme came together at the end, but wasn't anything spectacular (the mint was a little overpowering for me). Although the overall look of the tart was pretty with the berries, I think the creme could definitely be better. Crust was pretty good and I may use that base again.

I've been making this fabulous summer dessert since it was published 1992. The fresh mint custard blends spendidly with the berries, and I wouldn't change the recipe a bit. Everyone I have served it to has enjoyed it tremendously!

I haven't, yet, tried it with the mint but I've used the recipe for the crust many many times. The first time, since it was Autumn, I substituted fresh and crystalized ginger for the mint and used blackberries--Tonight, I made a blood orange curd mousse (aka "lemon curd mousse" if you want to look it up) and garnished it with raspberries and slices of blood orange. It got raves!!!

It's wonderful! I can't praise this recipe enough. It's simple, if time-consuming, and makes a heavenly tart. The crust is one of the best I've come across, and the custardy filling is simply marvelous. As previous reviewers have said, he mint makes a perfect complement to the fruit. (I have to confess, the second time I made this, I inadvertantly used sweet basil instead of mint--the plants look similar, and my nose was stuffed up. Fortunately, though, the herb was light and sweet enough that it still made a delicious contrast to the fruit, and no one who ate it noticed the mistake!)

This was amazing! I can't make spaghetti, but I had no problem making this tart perfectly the very first time. My husband is convinced I bought it from some fancy French bakery.

I made this for a little dinner party and it was loved by everyone. The shell itself is good enough to eatalone, although it was perfect with the cool crisp bite of the mint and the sweetness of the mixed berries. This was faster and easier to make than I expected as well...a very light summery dessert. One note of warning, the mint/milt mixture thickens very quickly as you cook it and can become clumpy and sticky so pay attention!

You must make this recipe - don't even look for any others. It's easy, beautiful, and the taste is beyond compare. I took it to a get-together and it completely disappeared. Everyone wanted seconds - and every bit of it was gone. People were actually using their fingers to get the little bits of mint cream and crust that were left on the tray.

Definately a keeper! I made this tart yesterday, using strawberries and blackberries. It was beatiful and delicious, with a refreshing minty flavor. All of my guests asked for the recipe!

This was amazing! Everyone loved it. The mint cream was very good. Just keep in mind you'll need at least a few hours to prepare the cream, the crust, and time put it all together.

I have to agree that the crust is the best tart crust I have ever had. I don't care too much for mint so I used the white chocolate cream recipe from "White Chocolate and Summer Berry Napoleons". I also added blackberries. This tart was so incredible that I was requested to make another for a party the next day. Truly FAB!!!Eileen

This was outstanding. The fresh mint flavor in the cream layer is very refreshing and different. It works great to make the components the day before. Assembling it before serving is a snap.

I've been serving this tart since 1992. It makes me look forward to summer berry season. Not only easy to prepare and delicious, but beautiful as well. (Instead of the mint infusion, I substitute kirsh and vanilla extract.) I give it five forks!

i have been entertaining with this recipe since it first appeared, always to rave reviews. I have alternated berries for fruits, when berries were not in season in this part of the country. Sometimes only using one type of berry. A must in all recipe files

This is a four-fork for me, not only because it's so delicious but because the crust is so useful when you want a true cookie crust and not just a pate brisee.

This is very close to a four-fork recipe. The crust is delicious, particularly in combination with the smooth pastry cream. The mint pastry cream is luscious, and I'm not a great fan of mint. It's one of my boyfriend's favorite desserts. Also, the crust is so easy because you don't need to roll it out; you just press it into the tart pan.
