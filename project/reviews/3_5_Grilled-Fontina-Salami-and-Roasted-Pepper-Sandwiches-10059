The flavors in these sandwiches blended wonderfully, even though I made some changes due to ingredients on hand. Subbed light rye bread for pumpernickel, cut back somewhat on the Dijon mustard, could only guess at the roasted red peppers (I had a partially used 12 oz. jar), and subbed Swiss for Fontina cheese. DELICIOUS, and I will make these often. Until tonight I never liked salami!!! And I doubt that my deli's salami was "Genoa".

Used imported fontina and salami and fresh roasted red peppers the finest of ingredients made it the finest of dishes.
