Pretty tasty. It's essentially a low-effort falafel in burger form, which I'm quite okay with. Lowfat, quick, they freeze pretty well, and the recipe can be doubled easily. The only downside is that if someone you cook for doesn't like chickpeas, this isn't going to change their mind. Still, it's tasty.

There are many things to love about this recipe: It is easy. It is cheap. It gives you a tasty way to use up your last bit of pain yogurt. Did I say it is tasty? My husband and I have made this twice. Following the recipe exactly, they're too dry to hold together. The first time we added water for extra stick. The second time we added extra olive oil for extra stick. Both methods initially provided the extra stick we sought, but we ended up with black piles of burnt fallen-off crumbs left in the pan by the time the patties were done. Next time we're going to try adding a bit of egg. Hope it works! Even if it doesn't, we'll keep making this good, easy recipe.

This was very easy to make, and well worth the small amount of effort. I would add spices to taste, and be careful about adding too much salt. I would not limit myself to just adding tomatoes to the sandwiches. Go for cucumber, lettuce, onion, feta, whatever suits you. I believe the freezing and flour do prevent the patties from breaking apart. Nevertheless, they are delicate. So handle with care.

yummy!!! i'm writing this as i eat. SO easy to make, so delicious! i modified the recipe a bit -- partially on purpose, partially by accident. i don't have a food processor so i tried using my blender, which didn't really work, so i mashed the rest by hand. i increased the garlic and cumin, and used ground coriander seed (different flavor from fresh, but i like it a lot w/ cumin, so...) i also forgot to add in the green onion and sesame seeds. even tho i had both. woops. but it's still extremely tasty. also, i didn't dredge in flour or freeze them. i did have a slight problem with them coming apart but i'm guessing the freezing is supposed to counteract this. whatever -- a tasty quick meal was had, and that's what counts. :-)

i didn't think this recipe was that great at all. it was fast and it was easy, but it wasn't that flavorful. the patties were dry and i felt they were too soft to be manageable. the yogurt was tasty though, especially with extra salt, pepper and about 3/4 tsp of ground cumin.

excellent end of the work day meal -- cheap, easy, healthy, and fast. i mashed the chick peas with a fork rather using a food processor to cut down on clean up and give the patties a heartier consistency. i would also add spinach and feta cheese to the sandwiches, yum!

Very fast very tasty. I added green onions and cucumber to the yogurt sauce too. This will feed two very very hungry people...
