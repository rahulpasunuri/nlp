It would be hard to mess up this great pizza. I've made it as written and then experimented with different ingredients (chicken sausage, caramelized onions, ricotta cheese), and each time it has been delicious. I agree that doubling the olive oil mixture adds a lot.

Well made this last night for dinner, and it was good but could not grate the mozzarella so sliced it and it had alot of liquid when it baked , took longer than 15 mins more like 45, did not use a pre baked crust...but hubby loved it and the final taste was good

A no-fail, masterpizza! I use fresh mozzarella and double the garlic drizzle (it really makes the pizza). This is one recipe I come back to in my recipe box time and time again -- and every time it's delicious.

Very good and quick to make. Added some mushrooms and used spicy duck sausage.

I made this for a party and put the sausage on half, portobella mushrooms on the other. It was a great success!

This is a delicious and easy recipe-my favorite kind. I have and will make this again. Served with a green salad this makes a great casual meal.

I've made a version of this several times using sweet turkey sausage. I've added some red peppers, olives, anchovies, etc. I also increase the amounts of cheese and tomatoes. I treat the recipe like a framework to build a great meal, but follow the recipe assembly.

Very tasty. Just enough to make it out-of-the-ordinary. Unable to find duck sausages, I used a good brand of smoked and flavored chicken sausage. My family preferred spicier sausage to a plain smoked variety. Don't skimp on the garlic dressing - it makes all the difference!

Any kind of sausage or cooked chicken would be great.
