Good, but need to bake before adding toppings, or bake 30 mins, otherwise crust is undercooked.

I made this after trying to make pizza using Trader Joe's whole wheat pizza crust and being disappointed. I left out the gluten, since I didn't have it. I added about 2 tablespoons of sugar to the yeast water. I kneaded it using a kitchenaid mixer dough hook and let it rise for 2 hours. It rolled out nice and thin, came out crispy after a short cook time. Made the perfect crispy thin crust pizza and calzones for my family.

Super crust. Rolled out really thin, baked super crispy. Thanks!

This is my new favorite pizza dough recipe. I had to find the wheat gluten at the local health food co-op but it was worth it! Rolls out thin to make a nice crisp crust, can also be left thicker and forms a nice chewy pan-style crust. The gluten does make it puff up more, so roll out thinner than you think it needs to be. I grew up in Chicago and am picky about crusts; this one's a winner.

I love this recipe too. While it is a bit bland, that's a very easy problem to fix: add more salt! I've usually gone with Marcella's pizza dough, but this is so much less fuss to prepare with less rising time and just about the same result.

This is the best pizza dough I have made, and I've tried quite a few recipes. I used it for calzones, but from now on this is my go-to recipe. The vital wheat gluten gives it a perfect chewy/crispy quality. Try it. You'll like it

Blah. Very bland and hardly rose.
