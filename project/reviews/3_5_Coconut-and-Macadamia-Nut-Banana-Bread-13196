Best Banana Bread I've ever made! I followed a few reviewer suggestions and used 4 very ripe bananas and did not toast the coconut. Made a very moist bread. I didn't have any macadamia nuts, but sounds like a good addition.

SO delicious! Agree with other reviewers about using 4 vs 3 bananas -- 4 actually yielded 1 1/3 cups, so the original must have used huge bananas. Made a few other substitutions and changes, too: Ground up the macadamias instead of chopping them, used lime zest instead of lemon, substituted 4 oz of the butter with 3 oz hazelnut oil and 1 oz walnut oil, and used 1 lightly packed cup brown sugar to counteract the sweetness of the bananas. Baked 12 muffins and one ring cake. Muffins took 20 minutes, ring cake took about 40.

I left out the nuts completely and added dark raisins in their place and baked it in 2 medium loaf pans in a 350 oven for just about 35 minutes. One we ate right away and the other we froze. The frozen one actually was moister than the one eaten fresh. My husband took it to work and it was gone in about 10 minutes. I think leaving out the nuts and adding moist raisins helped keep it from being too dry.

This was very good! The kids loved it! The lemon and sour cream add a nice refreshing kick to it! Might add a bit more lemon next time for even more zing! I did not toast the coconut and it was still very good. Probably will toast next time just to see the difference.

After reading others' reviews, I used 1& 1 /2 cups coconut and 4 large bananas. The result was a very moist, dense, favorful bread with a definate banana flavor. I used lime zest in place of lemon. I did have to bake it 48 minutes for it to be completely cooked through.

Just tried this recipe. Except for the lemon (I only had limes) I followed it exactly...toasted coconut, very ripe bananas, sour cream. I don´t understand how anybody can not like this bread when using all the correct ingredients, nor do I think it is necessary to add more banana if you use very ripe ones to begin with (as stated). My husband devoured a half mini loaf at a time. The macadamia nut is sublime, a much better fit than pecans. Can´t say enough good things. Love, love, love this recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes from my Gourmet cookbook! I've done SO many variations I can't begin to list them. But, as stated elsewhere, I always use at least 4 bananas and I've never toasted the coconut (which I think helps keep it moist).

This bread is great: moist and nutty! The lemon zest adds a brightness that I really liked. Will be making again for sure!

Eh...this was okay. It was a great way to use what we had on hand...ripe bananas, coconut, and macadamia nuts. I put in 4 small, super ripe and 2 ripe bananas and 1 1/2 cups of toasted coconut. It was fine but there are many fine banana breads out there.

Rating: 4
I made some changes to the recipe and it turned out great! I added more banana (4) and coconut (1/1/2 cups) and used all brown sugar. I substituted lime zest for the lemon and dark rum for the vanilla. Served it with lime curd spread on top and a scoop of tropical sorbet and vanilla ice cream with toasted coconut on top.

Rating: 2
This was okay, but not as good as I expected it to be. I added an extra banana, as many previous reviewers suggested, so it would have more of a banana-y taste. Overall, though, I thought it was a bit too sweet.

Rating: 4
I took everyone's advice and increased the banana's (4 1/2 actually) and coconut (I used 2 cups) and it turned out great. I made one loaf of bread and 12 LARGE cupcakes/muffins instead of 5 loaves. YUMMY!!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, but as reflected in some reviews, I found the banana flavor to be lacking. After experimenting, the final version that my family loves contains 4 large bananas, no lemon zest, and I grind up the macadamias and toasted coconut, which I believe spreads the flavor throughout better.

Rating: 3
I made this exactly according to the recipe and was pleased with the reults. However, the coconut flavor wasn't strong enough for my taste and as other readers mentioned, an extra banana wouldn't hurt. My husband found it slightly too dry and ate it with Nutella on top, so next time I will definitely add another banana- I used 3 huge ones this time.

Just made this bread this afternoon and I thought it was delicious. It has very a nice texture and good blend of flavors. I would make it again for a change of pace although it was quite a bit more work that the usual whole-wheat banana bread that I always make which doesn't even require a mixer.

Rating: 3
Best banana bread ever. Calls for a lot of butter, but man does this stuff taste GREAT! Yum! You could certainly leave out the nuts and coconut if you don't like them, and just the plain banana bread that this recipe would produce would still be delicious.

I just made this in muffins-style as well and used Malibu Rum to make the confectioner glaze, topped with a sprinkle of the flaked coconut and one whole macadamia nut per muffin. Also, used the pineapple suggestion (2 bananas and one cup crushed pineapple)

Rating: 2
I like the suggestions of the previous reviewer - sounds more like cake! I thought these were good. I made muffins instead of loaves since muffins are much easier to take to work for breakfast - the batch makes 24 and baked for 28 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly except for didn't use the nuts. I'll make again!

I was looking for a tropical type muffin and used this recipe for a base. Substitued 1 1/2 c of crushed pineapple in place of bananas and doubled sour cream. When muffins were cool glazed the with confectionary sugar and coco-lopez (mixed to glaze consistancy. awesome!!!

This recipie is awesome! I have baked it several times, and every time, I have loved it. Also, I added chocolate chips to it, to make it even better.

I thought this bread was a little too dry and needed more banana flavor. I liked the macadamia nuts but probably won't make this again.

Rating: 2
This recipe was ok, but it didn't taste of banana enough, even though I upped the bananas to 4. The coconut and macadamia and banana combination was great though,and in the future I would just add coconut and macadamia to a different banana bread recipe, probably a low-fat one. I omitted the white sugar and substituted nonfat yoghurt for the sour cream and cut down the butter to 1/2 cup and it was all fine.

Everyone who tried this, raved about it. I increased lemon zest to 2 tbsp which added to the flavor and bananas to 4. I have made other banana breads, but this really is excellent!

Excellent recipe! I didn't add any nuts at all like it asked for because of allergies. Loved the flavours of the toasted coconut and the lemon grind together. My family loved it.

I made muffins out of this, and they are very good. My only issue is that the banana flavor is not pronounced enough. Next time, I'll use at least another banana.

The banana flavor of this bread bursts with every bite. Used pecans as I had them in stock. I didn't toast the coconut but will next time...as the taste of the coconut will take on a different flavor. Yum....

Rating: 3
Excellent taste and texture, moist with a nice, chewy crust. I made one large loaf in an 11-1/2 x 6 x 3-1/2 inch Dansk loaf pan, and baked for one hour. Used 4 very ripe bananas, pecans instead of macadamia, lime rind instead of lemon and, borrowing a tip Moosewood, added 1/2 tsp ground ginger. Also used unsweetened coconut. Definitely a new favorite.

I really liked this recipe- tasty and easy! I used toasted pecans vs. macadamia nuts .

Rating: 3
Great banana bread recipe though I thought the flavor of the macadamia nuts did not complement the other flavors at all. The coconut I could take or leave as well--sort of depends on if you like that coconut texture in a quick bread. The bread was moist and I did enjoy the addition of the lemon zest.

Excellent. I cut down the butter, added about 1/3 whole wheat flour instead of all white flour. Does not need sweetened coconut! Very nice.

Very nice, moist banana bread. Followed the directions closely except for using lime zest instead of lemon (I like the flavors of lime and coconut together)and omitting the nuts.

I made this while my 13 yr. old nephew was visiting, so i added chocolate chips. It wasn't too much - it actually tasted really good! I would definitely make this again as it was moist and delicious...

Wonderful way to use up those black bananas! I didn't toast the coconut, and omitted the lemon zest and sour cream. Also, I made two large loaves rather than the smaller ones. The crust got a little darker than I would like so next time I'll decrease baking temp to about 325 degrees. Would have given this four forks if it hadn't come out a little dry; leaving out the sour cream perhaps? Anyway, my spouse loved it, as did I. A keeper!

This bread has a nice crust and was very tender. I used pecans too which were delicious...I also made 2 large loaves instead and had to increase the baking time by 20 minutes. If you need more banana flavor, try using more ripe bananas.

My family and neighbors loved this recipe. I have substituted pecans and the recipe turns out just as wonderful. It is one I make again again and again. It made enough so I could freeze a great amount. I take it out when unexpected guests arrives.

I left out the lemon zest, the nuts and the sour cream (I didn't have any of those things on hand.) It turned out fine. The toasted coconut give such a nice flavor and texture to plain banana bread!

Rating: 3
The coconut is a nice surprise in the recipe. I think one could decrease the sugar without a taste reduction. It was a tad sweet for my taste but that may have been because I added 1 more banana than the recipe called for. I used pecans instead of macadamia (b/c I had them on hand) and a bit of cinnamon. I made muffins instead of loaves, and baked for 30 minutes.

Great banana bread recipe. Delicious hot out of the oven. Next time I'll experiment with adding some spices to it.

I made this dish for a Hawiian style party and everyone loved it. I made 8 batches and it turned out incredible. As a caterer I will be sure to use this recipe again and again.

This is an excellent bread recipe. I made it in the processor and the result was a finely textured, moist fragrant loaf. I used orange peel in place of the lemon, marscapone cheese in place of the sour cream, and omitted the coconut, then baked it in 1 regular and 1 small loaf pan.

yum, hot out of the oven! i altered the recipe some. left out the white sugar, and decreased the butter by two tablespoons and will try even less next time. i also threw in grated orange peel, in lieu of lemon, and added a scattering of white chocolate chips.

I also left out the zest and added mini chocolate chips. I made two big loafs and had to bake it a bit longer. I made this recipe for my family and they want it every week!

Delicious and moist! I did alter the recipe slightly - I chopped up a bar of Baker's Sweet Chocolate and used in place of the nuts. I also omitted the lemon zest. I'll definitely keep this recipe on hand for future use.

I missed out the zest and the nuts (because I didn't have any) and the result was beautiful. I had to convert the measurements which took a while but it was worth it! I could get away with halving the mixture next time though. Yum!

Tried it this weekend, and was disappointed!! The lemon zest took away from the banana flavor and didn't seem to blend well as far as taste. Additionally, the macadamia nuts are not a good choice in this type of bread; the texture is all wrong. I make macadamia and pineapple cookies, and they are fantastic, however this combination did not work well with the bread. Sorry!!

Wonderful flavor, moist. This is the only banana bread I will make from now on. The grated lemon rind adds an interesting texture and flavor. I had pecans and dark brown sugar on hand, so made those substitutions. Since I made two large loaves instead of the small ones, they needed an extra ten minutes baking time.

this taste good, also if you mix in some frozen chocolate chips it gives it nicer tase (not saying it tase bad normal)

This bread is quite moist, which is nice. The lemon peel also adds a interesting twist. However, the banana aroma does not seem to be very strong in this recipe. Perhaps, the amount needs to be increased.
