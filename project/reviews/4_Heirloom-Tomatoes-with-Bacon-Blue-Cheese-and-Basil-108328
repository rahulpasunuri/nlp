OMG! this was soooo good, exceeded my expectations! I made it as written except didn't use the bacon grease. I used one large tomato for the 2 of us so the stack was not as pictured.

Admittedly, I altered the recipe a bit - trading sliced mozzarella for the blue cheese - but it turned out awesome! Next time I'll double the dressing to have some to pass, as well as to dress the plated salads. Otherwise, this is a fabulous salad!

Absolutely fabulous! Of course....the tomatoes make it or break it. Super easy to make and worth all the praise you will get!! Loved it! Ah....we don't care for blue cheese so I used a terrific manchego. YUMMY!

We made this recipe last night. It was fantastic, and a wonderful use of our first big batch of tomatoes from the garden. Only a couple slight changes. We brushed the bread with olive oil and toasted it in the oven while the bacon was cooking. After the bacon finished cooking we poured off some of the fat and sauteed the shallots in the same pan, deglazed it with the vinegar, and then whisked in the olive oil for the dressing. I can't wait until the next batch of tomatoes ripen, we're definitely making this again.

These are absolutely AMAZING! It takes some effort, but is a rare case where it's totally worth it. I tried it per recipe, but found the tower to be slightly unwieldy. I found a better variation using slices of cherry tomatoes and 1-inch toasts instead. Then you can hold the whole tower together with a toothpick and it's easier to server and eat that way. Easily the hit of our New Year's Eve party.

Can't believe how long I've been making this recipe and haven't reviewed it. This is probably my husband's favorite epicurious recipe. I use whatever homegrown or farmer's market tomatoes we have, not necessarily heirloom. And I dry-toast the bread. If we don't have blue cheese on hand, I use feta because we usually have some. All versions are delicious...my husband likes this so much that he's asked me to stop making it as an appetizer...so instead, we maker larger portions and eat it as an entree. Delish!

I thought this was good, not great. The combination doesn't combine to make something unusual--it basically tastes just like all its ingredients. My husband found it difficult to eat. Nevertheless, I'd make again, especially as a starter for a nice steak dinner.

subbed shredded parm for blue cheese and turkey bacon for the real stuff, and it was still great!

What an awesome flavor combo. I've been serving a variation of this recipe at the restaurant I work at for the past 5 years and, needless to say, it is a crowd pleaser! I never thought I would ever see anyone happily pay 10+ dollars for a tomato. :) Can't think of a better way to enjoy perfectly ripe tomatoes.

This is just beautiful and a lovely way to combine fresh, pungent flavors. I used sourdough bread, *fresh* pecorino cheese, (since I have a non-blue-eater in the house) and added a small pan roasted chicken breast to the stack to make something more main-dish-like...it was a perfect light summer dinner.

This was the hit of the dinner. I couldn't find decent heirloom tomatoes so used regular and I used gorganzola cheese and a whole slice, including crust, of olive bread. The dressing was very good. My guests commented that this was a great presentation and unusual way to serve tomatoes.

This recipe is Awesome, Needs the Bread to soak up dressing, Fresh Tomatoes, and Basil, Compliment the Blue Cheese Perfectly.

Have made this several times. Very good and easy to make. Eliminated the bread.

This was a great summer side dish. Used only vine ripe tomatoes and gorgonzola because it was what I had on hand and I don't think it mattered one bit. Halved everything but the dressing, and recommend doubling the dressing if making as is.

I served this as a salad course and modified a bit. I skipped the bread and substituted the blue cheese with fresh buffalo mozzerella from the local farmer's market. I layered about 2 slices of the cheese between the tomato slices. Other than that I followed the recipe. I forgot to double the dressing as other reviewers' suggested, and the amount was adequate. This is a great dish for tomato season.

I ditched the bread and exchanged the blue cheese for goat cheese. Got rave reviews. I think letting the dressing sit for a while and then rewarmed made it better.

dude.. this recipe freakin' rocked! Nothing like perfect heirloom tomatoes and blue cheese combined. Presentation is fantastic! I'm a younger guy, and even my drunk dinner party guests appreciated it!

A big hit! everyone loved it! I took a bit of a short cut and just used a balsamic vinagrette and added very thin rings of bermuda onion.

Delicious and a beautiful presentation, especially using very small (cherry tomato sized) heirloom tomatoes. Skipped the toast rounds, swirled the tomatoes on a platter and sprinkled the bacon, blue cheese, and dressing on top. Wonderful with the Grilled Steaks with Red Chile Sauce this recipe was originally featured with.

Trader Joes had heirlooms, even this late in the season, and had to make this again. This is an excellent combination of flavors and textures. We used apple wood smoked bacon, spanish onion, and red wine vinegar this last time with equal sucess as written. And as mentioned, do double the dressing.

Wonderful combination of flavors. Would make a bit more dressing next time.

I used pancetta and dry toasted the bread and brushed with a little olive oil. All of the ingredients really complement the different features of each variety of tomato. We used brandywine, beefsteak, and hillbilly potato along with some red and yellow currant tomatoes for garnish. Wow!

This recipe seemed complicated at first. But it was well worth the minimal effort. I have made it several times and everyone always loves it. Great use for excess summer tomatoes!

This was an execellent recipe. The only thing I would change is that I would not fry the bread rounds in oil, I would dry toast them. There is plenty of oil in the dressing which also includes the bacon fat.

This was fabulous and soooo gorgeous. I couldn't get heirloom tomatoes but I was able to find yellow and orange vine tomatoes and red grape tomatoes. I made all the other ingredients as written but there wasn't nearly enough dressing. next time I will make double. In fact I think I will make it again this weekend!

This recipe serves well for a light, summer meal. It was easy to prepare and I didn't add nearly the same amount of oil called for. In fact, I didn't even have hierloom tomatoes - just used regular, ripe tomatoes. Didn't have sherry vinegar on hand either. I did lightly saute the shallots and onion so it wasn't too crisp. Awesome stuff.

my sister made this and it was delicious--she could not find sherry vinegar, so used sherry cooking wine (holland house. this tasted fabulous and was very beautiful (she used just the red and yellow tomatoes). we loved it!

This dish is a beautiful presentation. Perfect for summer when heirlooms are at their peak. I used lemon basil and a milder blue cheese. Didn't have shallots, but a sweet red onion did just fine. Everyone raved! Definitely something I'll do again and again.
