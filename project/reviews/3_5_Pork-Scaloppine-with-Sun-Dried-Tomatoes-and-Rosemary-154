I've made this recipe twice now and used boneless center cut pork chops pounded out real thin. The second time I made it I dredged the pork chops in flour and added a tablespoon of butter in the sauce at the end. The flour and butter help make the sauce a little thicker and richer. Very easy and quick to make.

Very simple to make and quite tasty. Added shallots and increased the garlic.

This recipe was very good as is. The next time I make it, however, perhaps I'll add either capers or green olives to jazz it up!

My husband and I both loved this recipe and I will definitely make it again! I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed some shallots along with the garlic, and added a bit of lemon juice to the sauce. I also softened the dried tomatoes in white wine instead of water, and simmered the tomatoes and the pork in the sauce at the end. Yum!

This dish was quick and easy. I used fresh chives in place of the rosemary and floured the chicken prior to sauteeing. Also, added a touch of butter when finishing the sauce. Very good.

This was very easy and delicious. We will definately make this again! It went very well with our Chardonnay also.

Alright I changed the recipe a little. I used tomatoes packed in oil. I sauted the pork in the tomato oil instead of regular olive oil then instead of rosemary I added smoked paprika. Served over pineapple rice it was delicious! I will make it again though with rosemary. I love that herb.

My husband and I just love this dish as it is fairly easy to prepare and delicious!!! We made it on a Sunday night for one guest and he agreed it was simple yet tasty. Definitely staying in my recipe box as a keeper.

I saw this recipe done on TV and thought I'd give it a try. It was VERY easy, even for a beginner and is now one of my husbands favorites. DELICIOUS!

The pork was great not sure the tomatoes did anything for this dish. Next time, I'll try something else, maybe capers.

This was quick, easy and flavorful. Nice change for Pork. I used oil packed tomatoes but patted out most of oil with paper towels.

Very tasty--had it the other night and we both loved it! Will probably like to try with veal sometime too.

Very tasty and easy weeknight dinner. Served with orzo and broccoli.I processed the sundried tomatoes with the broth. Lots of compliments from the family.

HUGE HIT WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY! Hubby is trying to cut calories and this recipe fit the bill nicely. I calculate a single serving to be about 5 points on Weight Watchers. Followed the recipe, but seasoned pork with pepper.

Very easy and a huge wow factor with the intensity of flavor from the tomatoes and the rosemary. Works equally well with pork loin, and the recipe easily doubles.

This has become a household standard; it always receives rave reviews! Quick and easy for a weeknight meal, with exceptional flavor. Always a treat to hear the response this meal gets with such little effort!

Actually, 3+ forks! I love well-seasoned food, and salt is big with me, but the beauty of this recipe is that the wonderful elements of the sauce make it so flavorful, without salt. I made this ahead of time and just put the scallopine back into the sauce to let it slow simmer in it. Couldn't be an easier recipe! Served with the Charlie Trotter recipe for Potato-Parmesan Pave on this site. Enjoy! KIMBER

Took the advice of some reviewers. Used half oil-packed tomatoes and half non-oil-packed tomatoes. The sauce was very flavorful. It went incredibly well with a pear salad with honey-mustard dressing (homemade dressing, not bottled) and vermicelli with lemon-garlic sauce.

I loved it, as did my family...I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil and salted broth. yummy! its worth a few extra calories to me!

I added some shitake mushrooms to sauce. Very good pork!

As written, the recipe is typical of modern recipes that sacrifice flavor in the name of alleged health benefits and doesn't really rate more than one star. Use oil-packed tomatoes, increase the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and add a tablespoon butter (preferably not oleo), and don't forget to salt the meat as you cook it.

I agree. It is hard to get an idea about a recipe when someone changes several ingredients or substitutes ingredients. I think we should just rate it as is and say why we liked it or did not like it. We want the rating on the original recipe, not the revised one.

This was delicious and very easy. I doubled the chicken stock and the wine. Let the tomatoes and the rosemary cook for a minute or two in the chicken stock to bring out their true flavor.

Quick, easy and YUMMY!!! My husband and I both loved it and I will be making it again soon! I served with gnocchi and it was very light and filling. Added this to my favorite recipe book.

This recipe turned out to be even better than I had anticipated. The second time I made it, I put the sun dried tomatoes in the food processor with a little of the chicken broth before adding them and it was wonderful.

Simple, easy, and delicious! The second time I made it I bought turkey cutlets ready-to-go and it was wonderful. My family really loves this dish.

Very Good, and very easy to make. I served it with Basil Risotto and the two recipes go together very well. Although I made this with pork, it could easily be made with chicken, too. I will make this again for sure.

This was incredible. I can't believe how easy it was to make and how rich and flavorful the pork tasted. I served this with Rissotto con parmagian. Both were exceptional and will be a repeat in this house!

Excellent recipe. I did add some sauteed mushrooms for interest. My family asked that I make this at least once a week.

Not sure if I'd make this again. It was pretty good but didn't love it. Actually, think I liked the herbed noodle/capers version better.

What a perfect 4-fork weeknight recipe. It was so easy and so good, I wondered where the catch was! Served it simply with rice, green salad, and crusty bread. Everyone ate it up...even three slightly finicky kids!

My sister gave me the recipe and we loved it - alo served with orzo, and asparagus as well. I didn't put shallots and lemon as a previous reviewer suggested, but I think I will next time. And my sister tried a shortcut of buying thin sliced tenderloin - wasn't half as good as pounding/tenderizing on your own!

I felt like I was cheating, when I made this recipe, because it was so easy and fast to put together, and the meal definitely tasted like it would have been more time consuming to make. When I don't have any fresh rosemary around, I use 1t. dry. I like to double the sauce, and the sundried tomatoes, as I like to serve the whole thing over pasta or orzo. Thicken the sauce abit with 1t. of arrowroot,(or cornstarch could be used instead, but love the silky results with arrowroot),mixed with a little water. Bon apetit!

My Husband rated this a 5-fork!! Easy enought as a quick dinner! I simmered the pork in the pan with the tomatoes for about 5 min's before we ate, and that flavoured the meat nicely!! Very good! Company worthy!!

Very tasty- I would try it with a little chopped shallots and maybe, a splash of lemon juice when preparing the sauce. I think it would be excellent with chicken too!
