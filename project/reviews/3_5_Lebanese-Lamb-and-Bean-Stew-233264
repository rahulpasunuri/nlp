My family and I loved this recipe. I made my own Baharat. I first browned the lamb in my pressure cooker, then added the garlic and salt, when the lamb was fully browned I added the onions. When the onions were opaque, I added a bit of red wine and then used a bit of water. I boiled the lamb for 15 minutes and when I opened the cooker the lamb was melt-in-your mouth tender. I used canned northern beans, which I added at the end, stirred in and let warm up. We served it up with rice. It was so delicious! Will make again and again.

I wanted this recipe to work so badly, but even with all the spices this still came out really bland (and ugly!). I don't really think this can be considered a stew, as there was a ton of watery broth left in the pot. The picture is very deceiving because there's no green garnish in the recipe, and the extra water washes away any color from the spices. I also don't know why they just don't provide a recipe for Baharat, as it's very easy to make (and a cinnamon stick is hardly a substitute for 8 different spices). Luckily you can easily Google the recipe.

This is a wonderfully rich and aromatic stew. I took the suggestion of previous reviewers and browned the lamb shoulder first, then sauteed the onions and garlic, added the tomato paste and spices, and simmered everything in beef broth instead of water. I finished off the stew with a dash of red wine vinegar for an extra dimension of flavor and served it with a sprinkling of cilantro and a dollop of thick yogurt. Lovely.

We really enjoyed this recipe as a way to use up leftover roasted lamb. My baharat mixture was: 1 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. I used 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt for additional flavor. I had this cooking on a Sunday afternoon during a football game and it made a nice change from chili. My family asked for me to make it again.

I made this following the recipe exactly, which I rarely do. It was fantastic! Trust the amounts of seasoning, cooking times, etc. You will get fantastic results. It's perfect comfort food for a cold, wintry New England weekend. I made a double batch of the baharat spice mix and use it in lentil soup - try it! This is a keeper!

We really enjoyed this stew. The leftovers were even better the next day. I used my slow cooker set on the 6 hour setting. The baharat mixture I created was: 1 teaspoon cumin; 1/4 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon; 1/4 teaspoon ground clove; 1/4 teaspoon allspice. I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, but I used chicken broth instead of water. I used canned great northern beans, because that is what I had on hand. I added 1 tablespoon of sugar. I also browned the lamb with the diced garlic. This is excellent with crusty bread and a Greek salad. This will definitely go on the winter stew rotation.

I love this recipe. Over several tries I've tried some of the below advice, and I would decaffeinate recommend browning the meat, and adding a little stock or red wine to enrich the flavor. I also use canned beans to save on time, with no real loss. Bahart is essential, and as with any other Lebanese recipe you really can't use too much. My Lebanese husband loves it served over rice, but i like it just the way it is, extra thick. Have also tried adding some chopped potatoes to the soup, which added another layer of texture and some more variety. Plus, the Lebanese love their potatoes!

Lamb is hit-or-miss for me (I sometimes find it too gamey) but this recipe is fabulous. The Baharat spices bring out the complex flavor of the meat and the slow cook method makes it oh so tender! Even those who pull a face at the mere mention of lamb will appreciate this dish.

Made this with left over lamb. Loved the spicing. Had an awful time softening up the navy beans. Definitely a repeat recipe. Moosem, Ottawa

Made this stew tonight and think it might be one of the best recipes i have ever tried. The spice store was closed, so I made my own Baharat (1/4tsp of each cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, cumin and coriander and a lil spice satchel of whole cardamom and cloves.) Some improvisations.. Browned the lamb first, then added garlic and onions, then the spices to toast them a bit, deglazed the pot with one cup of red wine and then added 8 cups of homemade veggie stock. Cooked it in the oven for an hour at 350. Added the beans (I used Great Northern dry beans, soaked overnight) and cooked for another hour and 15 . OMG! this is maybe the tastiest dish ever! I did it all from start to finish in my Le Creuset. Can't wait to taste the leftovers. Definitely recommend browning the meat and sauteing the garlic and onions before adding the broth/water/wine...

This was absolutely delicious! Great hearty stew for the cold winter.

I buy brisket when on sale, trim it, cube it and store in the freezer. That's what I used instead of lamb and it was excellent. I did increase the amount of spices and substituted left over beef stock and red wine for some of the water. I also used canned white beans. The baharat is easy to make in a coffee grinder and is really worth the trouble, especially if you can't get to an ethnic grocery store. Great comments from company. Will make again with lamb when I can afford it!

Yummy weeknight meal. I used great northern beans, as they were out of navy beans at my store. They were a little mushier than navys, and I will use navy beans next time. Must use baharat! I made it myself with spices I had in the pantry.

This is the Middle Eastern version of cassoulet. I make this in a slowcooker with all ingredients (minus onion/tomato mixture) for about 8 hours on low. Must use baharat. Awesome.

This dish is exceptional! I cut the meat off of a bone-in lamb shoulder, then added the bones to the pot during cooking to give the broth extra flavor. I also put the beans in the pot at the same time as the meat, which, admittedly, resulted in overcooked beans. But honestly, I like it that way. They really thickened up the stew and made it creamy. I also added the onion-tomato mix after only an hour. Finally, I made my own baharat mix (found the recipe online) of Spanish paprika, black pepper, cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamon, and coriander. I'll make this again and again!

very good dish, I browned meat and added wine, bharat, and bay leaves to the water. I also put some canned tomatoes+tomatoe paste as one reviewer suggested. I didnt wait hours before adding everything together. after 20min of cooking meat I added beans and tomatoes and cooked all together for another 2 hours. Delicious!. the rice was excellent too. will probably taste even better tomorow when all the flavors settle in ;)

I love this and will definately make it again. I cooked it a total of 3 1/2 hours and the lamb became amazingly tender. Next time I'll use extra tomato paste, though, and maybe canned tomatoes as well. Baharat is at any middle eastern store, btw.

Simple, but excellent recipe. Like another reviewer, I browned the lamb first, which I think deepens the flavor. I also cut the lamb cooking time down to 30 minutes and it was still tender. I replaced two cups of water with red wine. I found the baharat at a local Middle Eastern deli -- I'm glad I did, as it rounded out the flavor nicely. My beans could have used some more soaking, as they took extra-long to soften on the stove. Overall, it's a keeper.

I accidentally changed this recipe -- didn't realize until it was too late that I had no tomato paste in the house. I think it would have added an important flavor dimension, but the stew was still very good. For the baharat, I used a cinnamon stick, whole cloves, coriander, cumin, and black pepper.

I used Baharat vs the cinnamon stick. My husband googled Baharat and found a few variations. I also browned my meat and added 4 cups of beef broth and 5 cups of water. After 30 minutes I added the beans and at the end added the onion mixture. I believe I would add the onion mixture the same time I add the beans. It was very good and am looking forward to the leftovers.

I made this for a couple of friends last weekend and everyone was happy. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a fair amount of red wine instead of just the water. The scented rice was an amazing compliment to it and everyone wanted more. I'll definitely make it again.

Tried this recipe keeping in mind the comments of the first reviewer regarding the quantity of liquid. In the end, the liquid wasn't a problem, but the cooking time was. A cooking time of 2 to 2.5 hours for leg of lamb cubes seems much too long. Cubes that size are usually cooked (and very tender) after 45 minutes to 1 hour and 10 minutes of simmering. Overall, my husband liked the flavour, so I'll probably make it again and modify the recipe by cutting cooking time by half and using canned beans. The fact that the beans are not cooked for the required hour along with the lamb should not change the consistency of the sauce (tomato paste is usually good for thickening up the sauce). I would also use the technique used for many North African recipes where you start by frying the meat in some olive oil, then add the onions and garlic, fry until soft and then add the spices, fry for a couple of minutes, add the tomato paste followed by water to cover the meat, simmer for 45 minutes, add the beans and simmer for another 15 minutes.

Very good! I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion and used beef stock for most of the liquid. Mine was the perfect consistency (do not be tempted to use canned since it's the beans that will thicken the stew). I think I'll try the red wine next time.

Great dish. I would have liked a little fuller flavor from the stew's broth; I might replace some or all of the water with beef stock and perhaps some red wine. I might also reduce the amount of liquid a little, because we had to simmer it for closer to 3 hours to reduce to proper consistency, which overcooked the beans a bit. Alternatively, it might help to cook a couple tablespoons of flour into the onions prior to adding tomato paste. We garnished with chopped cilantro, parsley, and coarse salt, and accompanied with stuffed onion naan & basamati rice. Spicy red wine (zin) works well.
