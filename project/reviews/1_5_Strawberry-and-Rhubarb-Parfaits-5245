This is plain yogurt with sugary-fruity stuff mixed in. Ok, so rhubarb's not the "usual", but this is too close to my health breakfast of plain yogurt and wheat germ. In fact, I ended up mixing the strawberry-rhubarb stuff with a little more sugar and my trusty wheat germ, and it was quite good. Definitely wouldn't serve this to guests as a dessert item, and certainly not in my good wine glasses! Here's an idea - any fruit mixture cooked down like this could be added to yogurt to replace those preservative-rich expensive things you find at the grocery. Mango-strawberry comes to mind...

This was my first experience with rhubarb, and while I managed to overcook the vegetable, the dessert still turned out well. When I make it again, I'll make the layers thinner and have twice as many to improve the presentation. No one complained about a low-fat dessert!
