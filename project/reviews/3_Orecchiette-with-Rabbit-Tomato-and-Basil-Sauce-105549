i was so freaking underwhelmed by this recipe. it was incredibly bland, no flavor at all. basically, felt like we were eating pasta with some tomatoes on it, nothing else came through. when we did leftovers (we are starving graduate students, too poor to throw food away), i found myself adding more wine, desperately hoping that some flavor would come through...and it worked a little bit, with a healthy dose of salt (when all else fails...). i would definitely not make this again.

This is a great recipe, easy and tasty. Has anyone tried subsituting red wine instead of the white wine in this recipe? Does it make much of a difference?

This was delicious! I used chicken thighs instead of rabbit (rabbits = "Disney characters" to my child) and added some sliced mushrooms. I agree with the reviewer below that this needs to be seasoned generously with salt and pepper throughout cooking. I would definitely make this dish again, it was quite wonderful.

Excellent Recipe. I will definately make again. I used chicken thigh meat as directed. My wife thought it was a winner also. Be sure to generously salt and pepper as written. I will most likely use this as a base recipe to experiment with different types of meat and poultry.

My mother makes a red sauce with rabbit and it's delicious. I tried this one with chicken thighs and it was almost as good as hers. The taste was reminiscent of rabbit and it was easy to make. I'll definitely make this again (with the chicken).
