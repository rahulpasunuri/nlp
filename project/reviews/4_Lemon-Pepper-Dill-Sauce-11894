Quick and great w fish or steamed vegies. It keeps well so we always have it handy.

Yummy! Was grilling shrimp for my husband and flounder (yes it can be done)for myself and at a loss what to use for a sauce. Ran a search for lemon and dill and found this. Added a small bit of honey and rice wine vinegar, and it was delicious. Oh yes, let me add that it was also great with the grilled vegies!

A perfect combination of lemon, dill & pepper. I used this as a dipping sauce for asparagus, mushroom & spinach phyllo hors d'oeuvres. It tasted great with all three!
