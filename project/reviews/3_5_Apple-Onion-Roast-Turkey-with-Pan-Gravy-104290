I made this for Thanksgiving 2004. This is the best recipe for a simple and traditional turkey. The gravy was perfect.

This is the best old-fashioned style turkey receipt. I added oranges and celery along with granny smith apples and onions.Cut celery & onions into chunks, score apples and orange. Heat that mixture in the microwave for 5min. I rubbed the inside of the bird with pepper, then stuff with warm mixture. DELECIOUS> HM HMM HMMM
