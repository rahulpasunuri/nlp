Used combination of flours, no problem. Packed 1/4C with olives, might have liked more, although, the amount was sufficient for flavor. Found the dough to be a little dry, but added a milk wash as needed for each. A bit tedious to make all of them, but well worth it. Baked a little longer than called for, they came out beautifully crispy, and so much better than store bought! Spend the time, and I am sure you will be pleased. I will make again.
