This dish was the way to my girl's heart: Granted, I changed a lot. Tomato, Watermelon, Onion, and Salt was the winning combo. T hen I roasted a yellow pepper and cut them into strips, cut up nectarines into large bite sized peices, sliced almonds, goat cheese, put it over a little spring mix and threw some blueberries on there. The sauce was a flop. I think I went too heavy on the ginger, and too light on the sugar. I would have skipped the ginger completely. The sauce was too much work, because as you will see once you make this, it is a wet and heavy dish, and last thing it needs is more to weigh it down. The longer it sits, the more liquid it produces, so drain it right before you serve. My girl said I have to recreate it over and over again, so I figured I'd jot down what I did so ya'll could give it a try. I'm done ranting.

This recipe is great. A friend made it for a party & everybody really liked it. I must admit, I had my doubts, but I really enjoyed it. I made it myself with little sun gold cherry tomatoes. It was easy, refreshing & used my over abundance of tomatoes & watermelon. A great summer dish.

Just awful. I was intrigued by the combination of watermelon and yellow tomato, but they really do not belong together. A very unpleasant taste. Definitely not something to make again, thoough it did look pretty.

I've made this receipe at least a half dozen times and everybody loves it. It is so pretty and colorful. It is totally different. If you need to bring something to a party, chances are that there will be no other watermelon and yellow tomato salad sitting there when you arrive. I do admit that I don't add the ginger. It may be great but I have not yet taken the plunge! I do highly recommend this dish. A brilliant accompaniment to your summer dining.
