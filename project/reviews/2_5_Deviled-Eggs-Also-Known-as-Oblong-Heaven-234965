Very disappointing recipe. Way too much salt and very dense. I did not serve to my guests. I had to start from scratch and make a new recipe.

This was great and I will make again. The cheddar makes it rich, but that's OK. It is a good vegetarian maindish for a picnic. The cheddar does add salt, so I cut back on the amount called for.

I was not fond of this one at all. Try taking out the cheddar and adding in 3T of cream cheese, lowering the salt to 1/4t and upping the dry mustard 1 1/2t. Now THAT'S deviled eggs.

These were allright... but not special. I never made deviled eggs before. But I think next time I will search for a recipe with a little more zing. And I think perhaps the cheddar makes it a little too rich. A recipe with some minced pickles or bell peppers would be more to my liking.

I made this recipe for Easter apps and I really liked it alot. It calls for way too much salt so I reduced it. I will make these again. I love Worcestershire.

I have had nothing but success with this recipe. These eggs disappear the moment they hit the table.

These eggs were way too salty and tasted a little "off" - so much so, that I decided against serving them to my guests. From now on, I won't try to get creative with deviled eggs - simple and traditional is the way to go!
