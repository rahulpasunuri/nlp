It worked well enough, but it was too mustardy, too garlicy and worst of all, way too salty! It was a good reminder to be careful every time you pick up the salt shaker.

Of course every one likes this garlic Aiolo! It is very close to the original Mayonnaise and is more correctly an emulsion, not a sauce. The wonderful thing about this Aioli is the marvelously simple flavor and the fact you are free to thicken or serve it thin, as real mayonnaise. An excellent addition to any dish

Yum! Very versatile and a great addition to an antipasto platter - you can dip anything into it. I eased back on the garlic and mustard a bit.
