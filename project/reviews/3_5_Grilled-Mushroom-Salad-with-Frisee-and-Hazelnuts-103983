I've made this recipe a few times, but the other night I changed it drastically and it was much improved. I roasted sliced mushrooms (mostly white and baby bell, but also oyster and Beech mushrooms--I don't care for shitake) brushed with a little bit of olive oil for 15-20 minutes. I crushed 2 cloves of garlic into a bowl and added very good olive oil, juice of 2/3 lemon, salt and pepper. Tossed the roasted mushrooms with the frisee and dressed it. Delicious and much better actually than the original recipe. First time using Beech mushrooms--yum! Didn't use the hazelnuts or other ingredients.

Couldn't get frisee so broiled a combo of shiitake, oyster (hard to skewer!) and crimini (ie, baby bellas). Add the broiling by-products (mushroom flavored oil) to the vinegrette at the end. We sliced Belgian endive and radicchio. Next time, we'll fill the leaves and top the mushrooms with vinegrette and the crushed nuts. And it's surprisingly easy to remove the skins off the hazelnuts. Great combo the nuts and 'shrooms plus the optional truffle oil.

This is a fabulous way to enjoy special mushrooms (those $25/pound ones you don't want to just throw in a salad). The flavor combinations in this recipe are great. One of my favorite ways to eat mushrooms.
