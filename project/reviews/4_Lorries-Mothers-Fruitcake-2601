This is the first fruitcake I've ever made and simply the BEST one I've ever eaten! The only modification I made was to use orange peel instead of lemon extract as I didn't h ave any on hand. I also threw in some chopped up prunes. But WOW, this is awesome!

This was a big hit the first time and now that I have had a special request for it during the holidays, you can bet it's great!

My mother was craving fruit cake out of season so we tried this one. It was terrific. We made a few changes. We used almonds instead of walnuts because that is what we had on hand. Instead of raisins, we used apricots and cranberries. As another reviewer commented - the cooking time was much shorter than the recipe indicated. The cake was beautifully cooked at 60 minutes - so definitely keep an eye on it. Enjoy!

This is the best fruitcake my husband and I have ever had. I made one large cake in an tube cake pan and one loaf pan. My husband broke into the loaf pan the day I made it. The large cake we soaked in grand marnier and enjoyed for the entire holiday season. I keep mine in the fridge and then we have thin, cold slices. One of my husband's fondest memories is of his mom sending him a fruitcake while he was serving in Vietnam. He loved this cake -- so did I -- and we will enjoy it every year now. Thank you Lorrie and Lorrie's mom!

This cake was delicious. I used half the sugar--I found that that the dates and raisins made it fairly sweet. Also, mine was ready in 40 minutes! Don't know what I did that was different, since one of the reviewers said hers took an hour and 40 minutes (which is what the recipe says).

Note that I have not made this recipe, I'm putting in a plug for another one. More than 20 years ago Gourmet published a recipe for Fruitcake Haters' Fruitcake which I think is still the best ever:Cream together 4 sticks (2c) butter, with 2 1/4 c brown sugar, and 1 c honey. Add 10 eggs one at a time, beating well. In another bowl sift together 4 c sifted flour, 2 t each of cinnamon and baking powder, 1 t allspice, 3/4 t salt. Stir half of dry mix into the sugar mix. In remaining dry mix dredge 7 1/2 cups assorted dried fruit bits and nuts (apricots, dates, pecans, golden raisins, etc). Combine 1 c apricot nectar, 1/2 c light cream,& 2 T lemon juice, add to batter, fold in the fruits. Divide batter among 4 buttered and floured 9.5 by 5 inch loaf pans and bake in preheated 250 degree F (yes,250) oven for 2.5-3 hours, until tester comes out clean. Let cool in pans on a rack. In a bowl combine 1 c brandy and 1/4 c orange liqueur and sprinkle each cake with 1/4 the mixture. Let cakes stand one hour. Remove from pans, wrap tightly in foil, chill at least one week. Excellent!

This was utterly rich and utterly delicious. I used a springform pan and it worked fine. Used finely grated lemon peel (didn't have extract). It took an hour and 40 minutes. It begins to dry out after the first day, so wrap tightly or reconstitute a piece by wrapping in damp paper towel and microwaving for 10-15 secs. I'll definitely make this again -- this is a real special occasion cake.
