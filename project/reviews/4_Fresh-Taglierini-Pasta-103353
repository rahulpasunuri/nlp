My first try at fresh pasta... and it was relatively simple and delicious! I had a few mishaps with the machine but I probably should have been more organized. This is a somewhat egg-y pasta and goes great with a Bolognese sauce.

I've made this twice now without a pasta machine--I gave mine away years ago. I take 1/3 of the dough and roll it out on a floured surface with a rolling pin. Once it's thin enough, I roll it up like a jelly roll, slice into 1/4 inch spirals and unroll them. I repeat the process with the other 2/3rds of the dough. After that, 3-4 minutes in boiling water and you have a delicious, rustic pasta. My family loves it.
