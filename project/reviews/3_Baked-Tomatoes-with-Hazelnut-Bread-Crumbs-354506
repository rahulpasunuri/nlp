Like another reviewer, I thought this was a terrible waste of height-of-the- season heirloom tomatoes. Was intrigued by the idea of the bread crumbs and hazelnuts, but the ratio of breadcrumbs/nuts to tomatoes was way too much, overwhelming. Also by toasting the breadcrumbs, then sauteeing them, THEN baking them, I don't see how you come out with anything other than overcooked (dare I say burned) breadcrumbs. Ick. Overall worth experimenting with, but I will NOT be making again.

What a great way to use all those tomatoes from my garden and the new thyme plant I bought this weekend. Overall I thought the dish was good, but a bit too heavy on the breadcrumbs. I'd love to give it another try with less breadcrumbs!

Delicious and super easy to make. I would cut back on the amount of bread crumbs. As the recipe reads, they are overwhelming

yummy idea, but here are a few suggestions to make it better: 1. Cut tomatoes no thinner than 1", or simply use halved tomatoes. Any thinner and it's very hard to scoop the tomatoes out to serve them! 2. Try using rye bread, it was great! 3. Add a clove of minced garlic to the topping. 4. No need to butter the baking dish or include butter in the bread crumbs. I thought this was a super easy side to make (used my toaster oven for the bread crumbs and hazelnuts). http://apricosa.blogspot.com

I found the bread crumbs were too heavy for the dish, even though I used less than called for.

Loved this recipe...wasn't crazy about the time needed to make breadcrumbs, but it was well worth it!

This is a really pretty and interesting dish-- but it turns out a bit soggy if you wait until the tomatoes are bubbling, and if you use ripe tomatos. Next time I might cook it for a bit less time, or I might use less ripe tomatoes. And this comes as no surprise, but it doesn't keep at all- assemble and cook right before eating, and don't plan on leftovers.

I made the recipe as written, and found it to be a spectacular showcase for fresh heirloom tomatoes. I definitely recommend using whole wheat bread for the breadcrumbs.

A waste of my good home grown tomatoes. The dish was overpowered by the flavor of the nuts.

I used 1 cup of Panko bread crumbs instead and skipped the toasting (you only need half of pre-toasted fresh breadcrumbs volume). I drizzled olive oil half way through baking. Very delicious.
