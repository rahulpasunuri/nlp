Delicious! I thought it would be weird with the thyme, I don't usually like savory in my sweets, but it was just a refreshing hint and was great. (Just a heads up, it was much thymier tasting the next day). Making the syrup was a little involved, but I don't think I'd make it the day before or else the thyme taste will be more pronounced, which I don't want, but that's just me. Wondering how basil would taste in this..
