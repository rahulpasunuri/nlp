Did anyone even read this stupid recipe before printing it????? It is unbelievably confusing, referring as it does to various "broths", and I was stumped as to which was supposed to go where. If I was supposed to retain the crab-boiling water, it would have been nice to mention it. Like right after the part about putting them in! (i.e., "reserving x amount of liquid for later". As it was, I skimmed the recipe after removing the crabs, wondering what if anything I was supposed to do with this nice crab-flavored water. Seeing nothing obvious, I tossed it, only to read later (on the 2d page of the recipe!) that I was supposed to have drained the crabs in a colander and reserved the liquid!!!! I could have screamed with frustration at the potful of broth down the drain, but if that water was supposed to form part of this dish, shouldn't the recipe have specific how much water I should have used in the first place? Luckily I caught myself and reserved the crab claws for the "crabmeat" referred to at the end of the recipe. Fool me once, etc.... I used clam broth to cook the rice, cursing the entire time. The pot is still cooking, but at this point I have no idea how this is all going to turn out. I used two rock crabs, by the way -- mercifully blue crab is no longer in season. I cannot imagine how murderous I would have felt if I were to have had to deal with 12 miniature crabs in order to come up with the requisite amount of meat per bowl Epic fail, Epicurious. And I am an experienced cook, BTW, not some newbie. The rest of this Christmas' dishes had better not be like this!

This is not a review of the recipe but more of a warning. Do Not buy or use frozen uncooked Blue Crab!!!. The natural water in the crab meat separates from the crab itself leaving you with mush for crab meat and crab flavored water. If you must use frozen then make sure they have been coked already.

This recipe was spot on delicious.It is laborious but well worth the work. I changed a few ingredients though. I used crab/fish broth and good Sherry. I omitted the rice and added cream at the end.

The inclusion of rice in this soup is absolutely ridiculous. Any other recipe will be better than this.

FINALLY a recipe that isn't by some crackpot who thinks mixing carrots, bananas, pigs knuckles or some other bizarre combination's that are a blasphemy to normal tastes! Lets keep the kitchen nuts off the board and stick with great normal recipes like this one! I have made this recipe many times, with only minor variants to the amount whole crab meat in the Bisque. Lay in heavy on the Paprika if you like it spicy.

One further comment. I agree with an earlier poster not to waste the meat on the whole crabs used to make the Bisque. If I were to go to the trouble to steam 12 crabs for this recipe I would certainly pick the backfin meat before mashing the crabs. Use that meat for a portion of the crab meat added for serving.

I live on my sailboat and today it was cold and rained all day. Rather than succumb to cabin fever I decided to try this recipe and it came out very well. A great starter to the evening meal on a cold damp day. After looking through some of the earlier reviews I made a few substitutions and additions to the recipe. (1) Substituted clam juice for 1/3 of the Chick Broth called for. (2) Used a single Dungeness Crab in place of 12 Blue Crabs. 12 crabs appears to me to be overkill to get a strong crab taste and an exorbitant cost. (3) I used ground Chipotle and Paprika in place of Cayenne (none on board). I did make the Crab Butter for serving. There is very little grease in the basic bisque recipe and the butter makes it pleasingly rich. I also experimented with adding chopped clams (came with the juice) and cooked wild rice. The wild rice is a keeper, forget the clams. Finally my Bisque came out a pale brown, not the dark brown shown in the recipe photo. Possibly because of my substitutions and additions.

Beautiful, heart-warming Spanish food; but why would you ever use chicken stock in a crab bisque? Instead of draining away the crab water it should be used for the base of a fish stock. Also, reducing the wine/cognac with the mirepoix by about 2/3s before adding the consomme will improve the flavour.

Made for X-mas using two dungeness (all I had available), but recipe would've been fine with just one. Wasn't sure whether to clean crab first (remove guts), and didn't but wish I had. The broth and butter were good, but half-a-pound of crab meat was not nearly enough. Because getting meat out of the crab would be a pain, next time I'll buy more lump crab meat. Also, 4 sticks of crab butter was WAY too much for the small amount needed to accompany the dish. 2 sticks should be more than enough.

thanks Scotch1 -- but did you use a frozen king crab leg?

Excellent! Didn't have Blue crabs so I used Alaska king crab leg. Being a Virgo, I followed the directions to the letter. As my wife said after, this recipe is a keeper.

will cooked frozen blue crabs work (that's all we can get here in Alaska)

We cannot find fresh blue crab, or uncooked frozen blue crab in Alaska (only cooked frozen blue crab). Will cooked frozen blue crab work, or some other type of crab, such as dungeness?

Now - don't get me wrong, this is a very good soup... but it is not really a bisque. Historically, the rice vs. flour thickening is good, but should be from a rice flour roux - the difference in taste for me is capturing that thick, browned butter flavor when you prepare the roux and then combine with the other flavors (sherry is important). The rice is simply blended here with the stock - A Bisque always starts from the Roux mother sauce. Even by culinary convention they have by-passed the "bisque" preparation by blending the stock as opposed to the actual shellfish "shells and all" as Julia Child woud have insisted.

DanielleBrandyMarie, you do indeed use the crushed crabs just for the broth, and the lump crabmeat at the end is what's put into the finished bowls. If you wish, you can use the meat from the crushed crabs to make the suggested crab butter topping.

Rating: 0
DanielleBrandyMarie: No need to waste the crab you crushed making the broth/stock. When you drain the stock into the bowl (leaving the solids- -spices, celery, carrots and crab) in the colander, pick out the crab meat and put it in a separate bowl. Add it at the end to the bisque with the other lump crab meat called for in the recipe. Too much crab is not a bad thing!!!

This is more of a question than a review. O.K., so I'm not a gourmet chef or anything like that. Just a stay at home mom of 4 wanting to make a nice dinner for my husband. I've never tried to make a crab bisque before and I'm a little confused about this 'crab crushing' thing. There are 2 places in the ingredients that mentions crab. The 12 crab at the begining and the 1/2lb. lump at the end. So, here's my question: If I'm crushing the crabmeat in the shell do I remove the shell from the meat or is that just to make a broth along with using the chicken broth? And the crabmeat at the end is what is to be added to the bisque? It's just that that's alot of crab to waste if I get it wrong, just want to get it right the first time round. Sorry, I must sound rediculous. If anyone can clarify this for me I would be very apreciative.

I'll be the first to write somethign about the quality of the recipe - superb. This is definitely what the Seinfeld crew would call 'Soup Nazi Soup.' As a self-titled soup specialist, I've yet to come across a better bisque.

For hunt2, sorry, I just reread your question and figured out that you were referring to the broth resulting from boiling the whole crabs the first time. You could use it, but you would have to strain it through a cheesecloth or a fine sieve to remove any unwanted solids before adding it to the bisque with the crab meat.

Rating: 0
For hunt2, you may be confused because the recipe mentions "foam" at two different stages. The first time is when you heat the butter and oil in a skillet. The foam that forms is from the milk solids in the butter. Adding oil to the butter allows it to tolerate higher temperatures with less risk of burning, but it still foams a little before it turns a nutty brown color and becomes fully incorporated in the oil. The second time foam is mentioned is after the major ingredients, including the crushed crabmeat, have been added to the broth and brought to a boil. This foam is mostly crab blood from inside the shells. It must be skimmed off, because it doesn't just disappear back into the soup, but lingers in clump form. Skimming it off ensures a clear, clump-free soup, You have to do the same thing when making chicken broth from scratch using raw chicken parts. Hope this helps.

Boil the crabs and then drain them into a colander. Keep the liquid. Heat the oil and butter in the now- empty pot you boiled the crabs in. Butter foams a little when it gets hot. Don't let the butter get brown, the oil allows it to get a little hotter without burning. Good luck!

hunt2 - the recipe calls for chicken broth and asks that it be added to the onions, etc so I believe this is what is creating the foam to be skimmed

Rating: 0
To Hunt2, yes, you put the crushed crab in the pot with the sauteed veggies and liquids. The foam that rises comes from the crab (similarly to the scum that rises when you're making chicken broth). This is what needs to be skimmed off, just don't let it come to a rolling boil until the scum is all removed.

Rating: 0
just wondering, if upon cooking the crab to begin do you save the broth to cook the oil and butter and other ingredients in? The recipe speaks of a foam to skim, and I assume that the broth would have to be in the pot with the butter and oil for foam to occur.? If anyone has made this or knows the answer to my question, I would appreciate a response. thanks.
