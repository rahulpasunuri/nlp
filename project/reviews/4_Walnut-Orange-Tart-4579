This tart has become a favourite at Christmas dinners, as well as other occasions. Everyone loves it. If you're pressed for time you can use a prepared crust, but it's a very easy recipe regardless. I serve it with cream whipped with just a little sugar and a slurp of cointreau. Delicious.

German friends of mine who had visited in the spring came back this summer and requested this tart because they had found it so delicious (and I had made lots of cakes/tarts during their stay). I couldn't remember what it was so it was a good thing I had the sense at the time to save this recipe to my recipe box.

I can't believe no one has reviewed this recipe yet. It is awesome. I made it for Christmas dinner alongwith a couple of other decadently delicious desserts and this was the hands down favorite. It's great because it can be made ahead (I made it 2 days ahead) and it didn't have to be refrigerated. Served it with fresh whipped cream (just slightly sweetened). It was the BEST. The orange flavor is surprising and really adds another taste dimension.
