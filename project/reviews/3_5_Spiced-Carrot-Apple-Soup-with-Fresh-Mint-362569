I added a dash of cinnamon to the spices, and stirred them in with the onion, carrots and apple to 'open up' before adding the liquid. The overall flavour of the soup was delicious but, frankly, didn't taste very carrot-y. My guests - and my son (the 11-yr old resident food critic) - loved it, so I will be making it again.

I really like this soup. I made it with only minor modifications: Upped the ginger to 1 TBS, and used some home-canned spiced pear butter instead of the apple juice concentrate. (There is NO way I'm going to buy juice concentrate for a single dish!) The soup didn't taste like much when I first tasted it in the pot, but it came alive with the mint. But it really shone the next day; the spices had melded, and I ate it at every meal until it was gone! I intended to freeze some, to see how it did, but it was gone in less than two days :) Easy to make, tasty, healthy -- this is going to enter my regular rotation of soups, especially during the winter. Next time I'll scale the ginger back to the amount specified in the recipe; increasing it made the ginger a little too obvious.

Easy, tasty, healthy and quick! Used white cranberry juice. Also added fresh garlic, increased the fresh ginger and spices. Looks like a creamed soup so is excellent for those who are lactose intolerant or have milk allergies. Will serve to company.

A quicker, easier recipe than I was expecting...made a nice warm comfort food that left me with no guilt.

We made this for a vegetarian dinner party (even though we are not vegetarians) and everyone was exclaiming at how delicious it was. I did have to make some changes and followed other reviewers' suggestions. For one thing, I tripled the fresh ginger and tossed in cumin. I also did not have allspice so I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg. Last, instead of garnishing the soup as in the picture, I used heavy cream to draw a zigzag line across the center and then decorated it with chiffonaded mint leaves. It was a huge hit and beautiful as well. One note: perhaps I made a mistake but I needed to boil the soup for double the time indicated in the recipe in order for the vegetables to soften up for the puree.

Wow! This soup was amazing! My middle-school aged friends and I recently hosted a Mediterranean themed dinner party for our family and friends! After the party we auctioned off all of the leftovers from the dinner and this soup went for a very high price! Every person that tried it, loved it and many people asked for the recipe! I was surprised at how much people liked the soup. My friends and I almost didn't serve it because of the smell and appearance. I'm sure glad we did serve it though, because this soup was DEFINITELY a hit!

As written, this recipe is probably three stars, but with some modifications I think it's worthy of four. I threw two finely chopped cloves of garlic in with the onion saute, used applesauce instead of concentrate (this cut down on the sweetness), more than doubled the nutmeg, and was pretty generous with salt and pepper. The soup was delicious with these changes. The mint is essential! Next time I won't bother with the chopped cooked carrot halves.

Really fantastic! Instead of chicken fat or olive oil, I used 1 T bacon fat and 1 T butter. I added another tablespoon of apple juice concentrate for sweetness and a squeeze of lemon juice for some acidity.

This was incredibly filling for such a light tasting soup, and it was super easy to make. Agree with previous commenters about the fresh ginger - very necessary.

This soup was amazing. I followed the directions exactly and it was absolutely fantastic. My husband told me I could open a restaurant with this soup. I would definitely make it again.

The key is to use very fresh (or properly frozen) ginger. If using good quality ginger, and with the mint and freshly grated nutmeg, this soup will be as flavorful as one could want.

What a tasty soup! I usually do a lot of creamy soups, but I wanted to try something new and little lighter. The only twist I added was to throw in a handful of parsnips along with the carrots. This was light and sweet, but I didn't think it was too sweet. The mint was a great addition. Honestly I only made this for myself, but my boyfriend tasted it and said, "Delicious!"

This is the first soup that I have ever made, and I was really excited about it. The ingredients sounded delicious, photo looked good, and the reviews were generally positive. The soup turned out pretty well, but I thought it was too sweet for my tastes. My husband liked it more than I did (especially after adding hot sauce!), but my son didn't like it at all. I think this soup may be hit or miss depending on the crowd.

We made this for Chanukah and everyone at our large holiday table loved it. The soup was a delisious start to our holiday meal. I didn't change a thing - except to double the entire recipe. This soup is easy to make, looks quite pretty with the garnishes, and was great for lunch at work over the next several days.

This was simple to make and very pleasant. I had no allspice so I used Chinese 5-spice instead and it added some zing. To the first "reviewer" on this thread - we have a policy in our house that you don't have to eat anything you don't like, but you can't decide you don't like it until you've tried it. Please spare us your opinion on things you've never tried.

This was good but not great as written. I followed other reviewers recommendations and increased the spices, and added a tsp of cumin as well. However, I took the leftovers the next day and added some smoked salmon as well as the apple on top, and it was delicious!

This could've used a little more zing, like maybe a wee bit of garlic, cayenne and/or cumin, and maybe more ginger or allspice.

Made this tonight and loved it. The only changes I made was to shake in a couple of drops of hot sauce and to offer sour cream as a garnish...Delicious and easy...Two thumbs up!!!!!

For some reason, this didn't taste any different from my usual carrot ginger soup (see Gingered Carrot Soup from Bon Appetit December 1998). I wanted it to have more apple flavor. Perhaps it was the quality of apples I used (conventional). I'll try it again but with organic apples and up the quantity a bit. It's a good soup as-is, but something needs to take it from good to great.

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. It was very good, certainly company-worthy, and not too hard either. Ingredients are in my cabinet, and it cooked up quickly.

Very delicious! Every one of my guests asked for the recipe. I made this with pears instead of apples as I didn't have any on hand. Also, instead of frozen apple juice, added pear juice before reheating. Sauted diced carrots and pears as garnish. Definitely will make this again!

I made this for upper last night. It was very easy to prepare and looked beautiful in the bowls when garnished with the carrots and diced apples. I would make one change - increase the nutmeg and allspice slightly to give it a stronger flavour. Otherwise, a delicious, and healthy dish.

The mint is absolutely a must. The soup is too sweet for my palate, but others seem to like it. I added Tabasco to the leftover, which was a nice change to also cut the sweetness.

Oh Wow! I have not even finished cooking this and I had to come review it. This soup is FABULOUS!!! I used Gold Rush apples instead of Fuji and do not have any apple juice....but aside from those two changes: I love this!! I can't wait to add the allspice and nutmeg and serve it to my husband. He's catching a cold so I made this to help boost his vitamin intake for the day. :) I will make this again. SO GOOD!!!! Thank you!!!!

Wow Illinois, I suggest you stick to your tins of store bought soup and resist the urge to spew your plebeian views on a site cherished by those of us who enjoy discovering new ways to tickle our palates. Fruit and vegetables make brilliant complimentary flavours (check out the Celery Pear Bisque on this site - AMAZING!). This recipe was delicious with a few tweaks (more ginger, used Pink Lady apples & shallots) and I will be making it again.

I rated this recipe at 3 stars as written. But a few minor changes can take this soup up a notch. Boost the nutmeg (about 2x) and add a couple of pinches of cinnamon. The mint provides an unexpected and wonderful twist to this to CLASSIC combination of carrots and apples.

Rating: 4
Excellent as written. In my opinion, fresh sweet carrots are the key to any carrot recipe. Too bad the so called Illinois cook's granny didn't teach her respect for other peoples tastes. This is an excellent site and a great source of information for real cooks.

This soup is rich, amazing, and has a depth of flavor that someone with a developed palate will truly appreciate. Don't bother with it if your tastebuds stopped developing in 1940's Wisconsin.

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it. It was very good and refreshing with great flavors. To the reviewer below, a lot of soups consist of more than an old chicken a handful of veggies and a bag of noodles.

Very good. Spices blend well. I used leaks and added some cooked squash. The fuji apple on top really didn't add much other than a bit of crunch. Might try another type of apple next time.

I am very excited to try this recipe no matter what anyone else on here says. They obviously are not mediterranean and know nothing of mediterannean food combinations. Thank you for the wonderfully unique food choices on this website Epicurious. After I make this recipe I will post my REAL opinion!

How about we save our comments UNTIL we have made the recipe. There are many "unusual" combinations that make delicious soups. One of our favorites is apple & parsnip. Make it first then please comment. I find comments of those wh have MADE the recipe invaluable.

I've made home-made soups for 44 years, my grandmother thought me, and I don't even need to try this recipe to know I wouldn't make this even if Carrots and Apples were the only ingredients left on Earth. Yuk! I'm beginning to see that Soups and other recipe's on this site are getting grosser and grosser, like it's some kind of gross-out contest. Get real people.
