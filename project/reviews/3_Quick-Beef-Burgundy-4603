I will not make this recipe again. It seemed to be in need of a few additions, so I browned the sirloin in 1/2 T each of bacon grease and butter, added a bay leaf and also some fresh minced garlic. It was only OK. Because of comments by other reviews that the meat was tough, I also sprinkled a little Adolf's Tenderizer on the beef. Nevertheless, it was a bit tough and the flavors were not as complex as I think they should have been. My guest thought it was a recipe worth "working with" to improve, but I'd rather find a recipe a really like in the beginning!

Followed the recipe pretty closely. I cooked the carrots for about 10 minutes (that's all it took for them to be crisp-tender), and reduced the sauce for about 25 min. And I dredged the beef in a little bit of flour before cooking to help thicken things. I was really pleased with the results, but the beef was not quite as tender as I would have liked.

This was delicious. There are some wrong times in the recipe though. Obviously it takes longer than 8 minutes to make carrots tender or to boil 2 cups of liquid down to 1/2 cup.

The kids loved this recipe, even the finicky 12 year old girl. I used mostly olive oil instead of butter, and it took about 20 minutes to reduce the sauce instead of the 8 in the recipe [maybe it was supposed to be 18 min.]. Also, I cleaned out the vegetable bin and threw in slices of broccoli and celery too. We ate it over noodles and it was a great hit.

I think it tastes good, but the meat was tough and I had to cook the carrots much longer.

This is really not a quickie dish. If you want it to be fabulous, you really have to do the work and try boeuf bourguignon by Julia Child or Thomas Keller. I'd call this recipe beef soup.

This was quite good, for a quick dinner. For more depth of flavor, I sauteed a strip of bacon, then browned the meat.

I thought this dish was delicious! I agree, the 8 minute reduction time MUST be a typo! I just cooked it down till it was a sauce rather than a watery soup. I also added the carrots and beef during the reduction time. To make it a little thicker next time, I will flour the beef before I saute it. I served it with new potatoes and it was delicious.

I also thought it was too watery. Furthermore, the beef and carrots were flavourless, having been cooked in the sauce for only one minute. But the sauce itself was delicious, so I will play around with this recipe.

I should have listened to the other reviewers, this was very lackluster, with no depth of flavor. It's not worth trying to "jazz" up with other ingrediants.

The recipe is very easy to prepare and yields a very satisfying, tasty meal. I doubled the recipe and substituted venison for beef. Fresh thyme is (always) recommended over dried. I personally prefer a slightly thicker sauce -- so I added a wee bit of corn starch. Don't be misled by the instructions to simmer (for 8 minutes??) to reduce liquid to 1/2 cup. It has to be a typo...

Well, I don't listen to my husbnad or boyfriend or anything like that for my opinions! I thought this tasted awful! I've been kicking myself all day for even making it in the first place. I don't like when people think they can add sour cream or grape jelly or some other weird stuff to make it "salvagable". If you don't like it...throw it out! Don't eat it if you don't like it...oh course, some would have to ask their husbands if this is okay.

My boyfriend and i both really like this dish. I steamed the carrots as opposed to boiling them. i also reduced the sauce almost all the way down so the beef was very tender and highly flavored. It also infused the carrots with the flavor.

Yuck. Chunks of meat and half-raw carrots swimming in watery beef broth just aren't that appealing. The broth did have a great taste, and I will add some cornstarch and sour cream to it in hopes of salvaging.

Remember how the Ranch Style Beans labels (back in the pre-PC days) used to sport a cartoon man licking his lips, and the caption said "Husband Pleasin"? This recipe sure pleased mine.

My fiance picked this recipe out of a few recipes that I printed from this site as his choice for an after work meal. He LOVED the smells coming from the kitchen as I prepared it. I sliced carrots with a mandoline and threw them when the mushrooms were called for. At the end I added a tablespoon of butter to the sauce. I served it with the new potatoes as recommended. My fiance, the meat and potato fan, loved this dish. I on the other hand, thought that it was easy to prepare, but nothing special. I don't know if I would prepare it again.

My husband told me I could make this dish again anytime. I used olive oil in place of the butter for a healthier dish and added the carrots and potatoes (red new potatoes, unpeeled and halved) at the beginning of the sauce reduction, rather than cooking them separately. Truly a meal in one pot.

Quick, easy, and very tasty. Got a thumbs-up from my husband and our guests. I added the beef and carrots during the sauce reduction to give them a bit more flavor.
