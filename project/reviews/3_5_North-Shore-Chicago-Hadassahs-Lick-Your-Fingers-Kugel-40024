I made this recently, adding 1 c. cottage cheese. Next time will also add sour cream. Be sure not to cool for more than 15 minutes (my mistake) or it's a bear to get out of the mold.

I made this with walnuts since I forgot to buy the pecans. Also using the suggestion of other reviewers I wanted to add cottage cheese but I needed this to be parve (non-dairy) because we were eating it with turkey. I made some 'cottage cheese' out of Tofutti brand vegan cream cheese and tofu mashed together with some sugar. It worked really well! Excellent!

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe because it had a few very negative reviews. Then I realized that the negative comments mainly said things like "too sweet" or "too oily", which I chose to interpret that this would be a delicious kugel. It definitely is tasty! I doubled the recipe and made it in 2 casserole dishes. With the pecans on top, it's like a delicious pasta cinnamon bun. Great for someone who wants a sweet kugel but doesn't like raisins.

For anybody who says this wasn't good, I'd say try it again. This was my first attempt at making a kugel - I normally am not a big fan. My mom hates sweet kugel. We both (along with everybody else at my Rosh Hoshana dinner) devoured this! I made it in a bundt pan and it was beautiful... Made it in the morning then reheated it for a few minutes just before serving. The only recommendation I would make is to make sure that there's plenty of butter/margarine in the bottom of the bundt before you add the brown sugar since some of the nuts stuck to the pan when I unmolded it. Which wasn't a big problem since my husband and I were picking off the carmelized pecans and munching on them!

DISGUSTING!!! Great concept but totally inedible. I threw out the whole thing. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS RECIPE!

They call this recipe "Lick your Fingers" Kugel for a good reason. I made this Kugel to bring with me to a family dinner. I didn't know what to expect from this...It was the first dish to go...not one morsel left over. I would highly recommend this to everyone!!!

I doubled the recipe, but wish I had not doubled the butter. Too oily! I've had better kugels.

This was so sweet that it ended up uneaten even by the children who love sweets! My husband who is opposed to throwing out food actually suggested that we not save the leftovers!! Despite following the recipe to the letter, it was dry. Not the sweetest Rosh Hashanah. Would never make it again.

I've been making kugel for years - with cream cheese, cottage cheese, orange & lemon zest, cut up apples & dried fruit. Always good but a little heavy. Didn't think the family would like anything else until this delectable side dish hit the table. The praline like pecans with brown sugar & butter added a whole new dimension. Added 1 cup cottage cheese & sour cream (forgot to add the raisins) at the advice of other reviewers and the results were just right.

Absolutely delicious! I made it for Rosh Hashanah dinner to rave reviews, so much so that I'm making it again and bringing it to the Breaking of the Fast next week along with the recipe.

I'm not even Jewish, but am hooked on this kugel after making it several years ago for a friend. Let's just say it lives up to its name-it's the BOMB!!!!!

I've made this recipe over and over again and each time it comes out perfect. Everyone loves it and there's never enough to go around. It's the best kugel I've ever tasted.

Sorry, but nobody at my Rosh Hashanah dinner liked this kugel. My mother-in-law usually makes the kugel but I decided to try this one. My mother-in-law was not pleased. I made it 2x. The 1st try made per the stated recipe was too dry and bland. I made it a 2nd time (rushing to complete it before dinner)! I added 1 c. cottage cheese, 1 c. sour cream and nutmeg. It looked great! It was still bland and a little dry. My mother-in-law is bringing kugel and her recipe for Yom Kippur...

Fantastic! This kugel was so good and so easy to make. It was a big hit with my Rosh Hashanah dinner guests and is sure to become a regular at our holiday dinners. I am not a fan of creamy, cheesy kugels and this was perfect, and just the right level of sweetness. I couldn't believe my eyes when I unmolded it, it was beautiful. I can't praise this one enough.

This was the best Kugel I have ever made and I have made lots of different Kugel recipes. It is DELICIOUS !!

I made this for an office party - lots of people didn't know what it was but the people who tried it loved it. I added the cottage cheese and raisins but have 2 questions: it calls for 1lb of noodles, the packages come in 12oz size. I think 12 oz might be enough. Also, 2t of salt seems excessive, I only used 1.

I made this kugel for our annual Chanukkah party and it went faster than the latkes! I used the recipe as is and added 1 cup of golden raisins and 1 cup of cottege cheese. It was beautifully formed in the bundt pan. Try it!!

I made this recipes for everyone in my family. That meant a separate one for my cholesterol free husband too. Nobody could tell I used Eggbeaters or Yolk free noodles. They loved both and walked off with my print out that night. And it was so easy. My only recommendation, use medium flat noodles. The curley ones make it harder to cut.

This got raves at our YK break-fast this year. My brother, the kugle maven, deemed it "the best." Go figure! I added cottage cheese and next time will mix some of the brown sugar in the noodle/egg batter for a more uniform golden color. Used a bundt pan and convection bake. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow was this gorgeous! Everyone loved it. Per everyone's comments, I used a little less butter, added low fat cottage cheese and golden raisins. I cut down the sugar just a bit. Made it in a bundt pan and got raves.

This was very beautiful to look at and tasted great....next time I will use a LOT less butter and more low fat cottage cheese (recommended by one of reviewers) to achieve the moistness. I did use a bit of cottage cheese and some raisins and they were great additions.

This is the best kugel ever. And it was easy to make. This will be the third year in a row I'm making this wonderful recipe to rave reviews. Comments I received were that it really tastes like a wonderful dessert.

Easy, tastes great, beautiful. For passover added raisins, used margarine. I think less nuts and margarine on the bottom would still be good. I love how everything looks turned out from a bundt pan! This was great!

My friends have named this the Sexiest Kugel in the World - it's easy on the eyes. I think it's even easier on the tastebuds. If you can find them, I recommend replacing the plain pecans with candied pecans or walnuts. Absolutely delicious!

I served this last night to a group of non-Jewish people who had no idea what kugel was. They all loved it! It was also the first time that I had tried this recipe and I really enjoyed it as well - I will definitely make it again!

I made this for 1st night Rosh Hashanah and my husband asked me to make this again a week later for Yom Kippur! I thought the filling was a little to bland so I mixed in 1 cup cottage cheese and 1 cup raisins which added to the flavors. The pecan topping made an arresting presentation.

I had never even tried kugel before, but this is a very good recipe. This was so easy to make. I brought it to a breakfast meeting and it was gobbled up.

This makes a beautiful presentation and was very good, even when made with non-dairy margerine. It was much better served warm than cold or at room temperature.

Absolutely delicious! There were no leftovers after the first night of Rosh Hashanah so I had to make a new one for the second night! This will become a tradition in our home.

This recipe makes people happy but, it is a touch formal with the pecan placement. I prefer to add dark raisins mixed in and sprinkled on top.

This is a delicious dish - fattening, yes, but worth indulging in once a year for a holiday.
