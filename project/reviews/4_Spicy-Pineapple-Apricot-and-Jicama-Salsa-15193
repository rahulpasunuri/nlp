Served this with our Easter ham. A great marriage of flavors and textures that made for a wonderful complement to the meal. Terrific tastes that meld together very well. And the crunch is wonderful. Will try the leftovers with some chicken on the gril. A winner!

This recipe won the "Quatro de Mayo" salsa contest that our company held. It beat out all the "authentic" type salsas! It definitely needs to sit and let the flavors mingle for several hours. I will be serving this all summer!

A slight variation of one that I sorta borrowed from a Mexican place along the Pacific coast of Mexico. I used Jalapenos (but the habaneros sound better), pineapple, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, jicama and placed them into a container to marry. You get the hot, sweet, bitter, crunchy and cold all at once. Worth the time and effort to use your imagination on variations.

Delicious. Made it without the jicama (not available in my part of the world) but just substituted more pineapple. Great with roast chicken.

I serve this salsa in the summer with grilled chicken thighs - boneless/skinless that have marinated inlime juice and a amount of cumin, chile, garlic.
