I had a trimmed and tied lamb shoulder in the freezer, which I used for this. I should have untied and trimmed it before marinating! I untied it after the overnight marinade, and it turned out to be almost 1/3 fat, but by then it seemed too late. I thought the marinade was lovely and also made a great sauce, but I found the nut crust too cloying and sweet. I would definitely make this again, but I think I would just do the marinade and sauce, without the crust.

This is a great lamb preparation! The sweet nutty crust, with the cool, spicy sauce, and yummy roasted lamb rocked it. My guests said best lamb ever. My toddler kept asking for more meat with "sprinkles".

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, I love to cook and make different meals. It was amazing. In his words, it was the most flavorful, delicious meal he has ever had. Thank you!

Delicious dish and as one reviewer indicated, a nice departure from the usual lamb dishes. I found the dish to be very labor intensive. Good ideas on uses for the left over sauce!

I had a friend make this this weekend, and it was a huge hit. There was hardly any left!

As previous posters said, too much marinade/sauce. Half the marinade recipe would have been sufficient, and I did 3 small lamb roasts for a dinner party. That said, everyone thought it was excellent and a nice departure from the usual lamb recipes.

I had never made anything like this before. I had serious doubt as I progressed through the recipe, but continued on faith. The result was Truly Exceptional (The nut crust is divine) and my guests are still raving about this dish a week later. I followed the recipe exactly and found that the amount of sauce was too much -- I have so much leftover (will try marinating chicken in it later this week!). My butcher did give me the lamb shoulder tied, and I had to decide if that was right or not. I decided to untie the lamb and shape it in the pan per the recipe and I think that was the correct route.

This was delicious, followed the recipe as is. Any extra sauce is good as a dip for crudités

We had this for dinner last night, followed the recipe except used lime juice instead of lemon (I have a lime tree). It was delicious, will definitely be making this again.
