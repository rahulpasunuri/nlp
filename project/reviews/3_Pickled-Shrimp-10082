Use lemon juice instead of the slices. The lemon rind imparts a slight bitter taste.

Thanks to the previous reviewers, I was careful not to include the lemon pith. It meets my test for easy, delicious, and the ability to make it in advance. There is a picture in Gourmet's February 1995 issue!

I have been making this dish ever since it was first published and it has always received rave reviews. Be sure to use fresh lemons and red onion (not white or yellow) and do brush off some of the pickling spice before serving (it can be a little hard on the teeth).

I had to give this 2 forks as written. I, also, thought there was a slight "brackish" taste & thought it might be from the lemon pith. This was really easy & I will make it again with lemon juice & lemon zest. My guests thought this was wonderful.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but the lemon pith gave the shrimp a bitter taste the next day which took a lot of additional flavoring to undo. Next time I would trim the lemons or something to avoid the bitterness from the overnight marination.
