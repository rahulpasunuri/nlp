This is good, but I found it sweeter than I was used to having in restaurants. Next time I'll do red wine instead of the brandy and white wine, and I'll add another cup or two of broth. (Also, in an attempt to counteract the sweetness I added more mustard: not a good idea, since the soup was just as sweet but then had a slightly bitter aftertaste.)

I think this is one of the best French Onion Soups that I have made. It's very easy too. If you don't want to add sugar to the onions, you can add kosher salt instead. Just be sure to use low salt broths if you plan on doing that. I think the brandy and mustard give it the unique and homemade flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe and thought it was delicious. I used vidalia onions and i did have the time to carmelize then I cooked them for 4 hours on low. They melted in your mouth. I wills say that I think that if i had less time it would be fine to do it as indicated above and as long as you use ingredients from a whole foods type market their should not be any reason beef bouillon or sugar should matter it should still taste great and be yummy!

This was great. I used homemade beef stock and added 2 cups more than called for. I like a little more broth with the onions. Otherwise, the instructions and ingredients were followed. My family loved it. Regarding the sugar comment, while those who have time can carmelize the onions without the sugar, many recipes add the sugar and it shortens the carmelizing time without sweetening the onions.

Sorry, but canned broth..sugar? If you properly carmelize the onions the way they should be for an onion soup, you wouldn't need the sugar. And you wouldn't need any other ingredients to richen the broth if you used homemade stock. Beef base is too salty and bouillon cubes? ICK!!!!

Very easy to prepare and excellent taste! I used red wine in place of wine & brandy and all low-sodium beef stock. Added a splash of dry sherry at the end. Taste was far better than most resturant soups! Will definitely make again.

I thought it was a good recipe for a base. I did feel the need to "richen" the broth by adding beef base, Worchester sauce, garlic & Maggi beef seasoning. I also cut back the amount of butter. It was awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made this dish for brunch & my boyfriend & I really enjoyed it on a blustery cold day. I used red wine in place of the white wine & brandy & took my time browning/carmelizing the onions. I also used all beef stock & a honey dijon mustard. When I reheated the leftovers for lunch, at work the next day, my colleagues all commented favorably because of the aroma - not "oniony", but fragrant & appetizing. This is also an easy recipe to halve, or double, or triple.

Great and easy. Rich tasting despite the short cooking time. Perfect for an impressive yet quick meal. I might try not toasting the bread next time - it would be good softer.

I used 6 beef bouillon cubes to 4 cups of water instead of 2C chicken broth/2C beef broth. And we used Gruyere instead of Swiss cheese. Everyone loved it! A great recipe for a traditional, flavorful soup. Served with Christmas Eve crab dinner.

This was a taste and easy meal to make even on a week night. I served it with pugliese and pancetta sandwishes for a satisfying dinner. I did substitute all beef broth for the chicken broth.

I was very disappointed with this. It lacked the rich brothy flavor I expect in a french onion soup. If you must try this, use all beef broth...the chiken broth just didn't cut it. This was just not at all what I was hoping for.

I have made this numerous times, changing it a bit each time, but always coming back to the basic recipe. Really good and easy. Great with a burger on a Saturday night when you want to just hang out.
