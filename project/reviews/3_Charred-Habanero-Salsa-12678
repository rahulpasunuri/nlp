Add roasted onion and roasted garlic, and some lime juice to make an excellent mexican salsa.

I would make this again, but I'd add a few things to make it more interesting, such as lime juice and some more spices. I found roasting the tomatoes and peppers in the oven instead of pan roasting them gave it more of a charred flavor. Worth the effort, but there is lots of room to play with this recipe.

I thought this added nice punch to a roast pork loin in a mango-mustard glaze. However, I did add 1/2 teaspoon lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon sugar to make it work.

This is soooo simple to make, and it's really quite good. I think I'll attempt to "doctor" it next time - add a few seasonings to the mix. Try to get it to the state of addictiveness. Excellent base for a salsa, excellent idea. Too spicy for the majority of my guests, though.

I really enjoy super-hot foods and especially recipes that include habaneros. This is a very good recipe.

Habaneros are wonderful and they do add alot to a dish. But, I own a Mex. Rest. and habaneros and tomatoes alone need a little help to be the "extreme salsa". Come in and see us if you are ever in SW Arizona - Salsa Fiesta - Willcox, AZ
