A scrumptious side dish any time of the year! Reduced butter by 1/2; substituted EVOO. Salt and pepper to taste. Be sure to cut baguettes in small bit-size pieces and cook uncovered for last 15-20 minutes.

This stuffing was delicious. In the past I've always made stuffing that had bacon or sausage as an ingredient. This sage stuffing doesn't have it, and doesn't need it. It's simple yet so incredibly delicious. And the texture was perfect.

Well, I must be a traditional kind of girl when it comes to stuffing... I absolutely love this recipe. In my opinion, fresh sage is the only herb stuffing and I would not taint it with anything else as other reviewers have suggested. But, that's just me. I love simple, intense flavors and sage is the taste I associate with stuffing.

Substituted on-hand ingredients: challah and vegetable broth. Perfect traditional stuffing recipe!

I made this on Thanksgiving in lieu of my usual sage stuffing recipe. I followed the directions exactly, but found it to be very bland. It is a good base, but needs more flavor.

This is a great base recipe for stuffing! I'd never made it before and my only tweak was to leave it in the oven for 20 minutes without the cover instead of 10. Rave reviews from everyone! I did jazz it up with a few butternut squash cubes, fresh cranberries, and pecans. They gave it an impressive look but it would have tasted just as great without.

This is an excellent, excellent stuffing recipe. Definitely use turkey stock rather than chicken (even when eating this with chicken, I just think turkey flavored stuffing is always better). I usually cook the sage and celery leaves in with the onions for the last few minutes. Don't count on this being enough for 6 people, because it's so good... for 8 people I double the recipe and it's a good amount.

This is an excellent, very easy stuffing. I made it for Thansgiving and it was a huge hit. I also make it often with chicken and substitute chicken stock for the turkey. For such a simple recipe it is truly to-die-for.

Added mushrooms, since had them on hand, and thyme, as a previous reviewer suggested. Baked in a 13 x 9 inch pan with de-skinned turkey thighs on top of it. Tasted very yummy with all that good turkey gravy on it.

The flavors were right on but I will make some changes next time. I will cut the bread, onion and celery in to smaller pieces. I will also cook the onion and celery a little longer and perhaps add a bit more stock.

Do they really mean celery leaves???

Have not made this recipe but this is our traditional family stuffing recipe. I would suggest that you add a little thyme to the ingredients.
