Very good and quick week night fare. Definitely not special enough for a major holiday. I also added some poultry seasoning to the dressing. Be sure to baste the birds with a bit of butter or chicken broth if you want a nice brown, crispy skin. The most telling comment came from my partner who declared his grandmother would love it.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve for my daughter-in-law who could not eat the Prime Rib we also had planned and cooked. She absolutely loved it. It was simple and very clssy and the timing of the game hen going in the oven and cooking for 30 minutes after the prime rib came out to rest worked out so well that I will definately make this again.

Simple and classic. I basted the hens with a Raspberry glaze to add color and flavor and served it with a complementary Raspberry Applesauce.

My husband and I loved this! My mother always served Cornish Game Hen on special occasions, and so I thought I'd treat ourselves with this recipe. There was nothing exotic or complicated about it. Just plain elegant, traditional, comforting and taaaasty! The dressing cooked in the pan under the chicken, was absolutely delicious.

I made it for Christmas dinner for me and my boyfriend. A perfect dish for two. I lowered the cooking temperature to 375 degrees about 1/2 through because I was concerned that the birds would dry out from cooking so quickly. They turned out great and my boyfriend and I had a great Christmas dinner.
