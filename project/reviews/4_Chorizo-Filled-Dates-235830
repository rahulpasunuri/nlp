With these flavors, it's hard to go wrong. We didn't use toothpicks, which were really key because the bacon burst open as it cooked. Delicious anyway!

Taste, wonderful. I got the applewood bacon and the dates at Costco. I really don't like the frying thing however. I started that way, and it seemed greasy and inefficient. So I put them in the oven. Easier, less messy and the bacon was more evenly done. This time I used Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce for dipping. Worked well with the flavors.

We made this recipe from our favorite cookbook which calls for breading the dates before frying (I used canola oil). It may be the most delicious thing to ever come out of our kitchen - I would highly recommend dipping in egg and bread crumbs, it made a perfect crust.

Definitely a winner!

I made these for a family gathering on Christmas Eve and they were well received. Stuffing the dates with the crumbled chorizo was a little difficult though. Next time I'll try it with whole pieces.

Just had these at Meditarrano, they were delicious! The restaurant served them on a romesco sauce and used whole pieces of chorizo instead of the crumbled mixture. I probably wouldn't have tried this recipe if I hadn't had them at a restaurant. We plan to serve these at our next party.

I could not find fresh chorizo so used merguez instead. Very delicious and very rich. I would not serve more than 2 per person unless you want to seriously compromise appetites for what follows this appetizer.

Try with pancetta instead of bacon, very tasty. Also nice with a date or fig jam, thinned, as a bit of a sauce for the plate. Tasty with a simple green salad topped with shaved Manchego cheese.

Just had these at Snake River Grill and was pleasantly surprised to find that SRG has released their recipe! Tried them there first and like every item on their menu - spectacular! Made them today at home: Used Costco Medjool dates - worked fine; also, found that I had to get more bacon when I attempted to pre-cook it, as it shrunk too much and would not wrap the dates completely. Has any one tried finishing them in a wood-fired oven?

Raves from everyone at potluck that ate these. Easy to make and tasted great! This is a keeper!

This is a great appetizer. We love the combination of flavors: the sweet date, spicy chorizo and smoky saltiness of the bacon. I get requests for this one often.

we often get fresh dates in Portland, but the quality can vary. I have been happy with the Dole brand whole dates (not dried) which are packed in a bag, found in the baking section.

This and many variants are familiar to me. The key is fresh dates and to answer A Cook from Milwaukee, move to California. Starting about now and going on to late fall, the farmers markets here are piled with Medjool, Barhi and Deglet Noor.

I have a similar recipe using blanched whole almonds instead of the chorizo and it is fabulous! The chorizo is a great idea and I think I will make a platter of each for my next cocktail party. You should be able to get dates at your supermarket. If it's not stocked, your produce manager should be able to order them for you.

where do you get the dates? I am only familiar with dried..

To die for.... This recipe has been on the El Paso cocktail curcuit for years. One bite is addictive.

I've made this with mozzerella cheese instead of the Chorizo; heaven. They are called flavor bombs.
