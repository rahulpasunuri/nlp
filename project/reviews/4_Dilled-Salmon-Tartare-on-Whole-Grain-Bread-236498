This recipe is very good, and quite easy to make. I just serve it with crackers. Tasters want to lick the bowl! We just came from a trip to Alaska and friends asked me to PLEASE forward this recipe to them for the salmon that we caught and shipped home.

My wife says it's the best appetizer recipe yet. Followed the suggestion of rolling up in a lettuce leaf. Outstanding.

Yummy and easy to prepare-- the hallmarks of any functional recipe. I made this for an intimate New Year's Eve gathering. My family teased me, calling it faux sushi. . .but it didn't stop them from scarfing it down! I made the sauce, but used it as a dip for cold shrimp. There were assorted crackers and bread on the table for people to take as they liked. Would also be nice rolled up in lettuce leaves or spooned into endive. Will be serving this at lots more elegant gatherings.

What a HIT! We had an appetizer dinner at the cottage and everyone raved about this one...best on the table. Will certainly make it again.

salmon was great. Use good quality bread. I added a little more lime. does not need the honey mustard sauce, a lighter verison

Surprisingly good recipe. Complements from everyone. Did not add the lime to the Tartar mix. Had lime juice on the side to allow application separately minimizing the cooking from the lime juice.

I went to a restaurant last night and ordered their Salmon Tartare which I enjoyed immensely. When I commented to the owner she told me that the recipe came from Epicurious so now here I am bookmarking it. This was EXCELLENT! I am a bit tired of tartare with Asian flavors and this was outstanding. It was served in a martini glass on a small bed of mesclun mix. WOW!

To the Seattle reviewer, if you ever come up to Vancouver, try to get some of Leslie Stowes' Rain Coast Crisps. Excellent with this recipe.

This recipe was part of a progressive dinner for a New Year's Eve weekend celebration. Everybody loved it,even those intimidated with the idea of consuming raw fish. The only change I would make is to use a rye type craker instead of the soft pumpernickel bread ( I too used the small cocktail rye) for a different texture. Everything was very soft and could have benefited from the crunch and texture of a rye cracker. Trader Joes use to sell a gourmet rye cracker with parmesean cheese toasted on top but they have since (at least in our area)discontinued stocking it. Can anyone recommend a good gourmet rye cracker?

Loved it, and followed exactly except that I only used 10oz of fish--clearly 16oz was way too much. A crowd favorite which I will definitely make again.

This is a great appetizer to bring to any party. I used prepackaged appetizer size pumpernickel bread. Ditto on cutting the salmon while partially frozen.

This is wonderful. We used it as an appetizer while waiting for the prime rib to cook. Everyone enjoyed it. I will make this again.

I'd give it four forks - with a few suggestions. Do partially freeze the salmon for easier slicing, but most importantly - add the salmon to all the other ingredients ONLY last minute. The lime juice will "cook" the salmon (like in seviche) and it will become pale and mushy. The honey mustard and mayo combo is a great hit.

I 1.5 timed the recipe as my salmon filet was larger than 1 lb. The salmon cubed up much better while still partially frozen so I would recommend buying fresh, and then freezing it overnight yourself. I thought it needed, and added more shallot and red onion, probably double what the recipe called for. This was a hit with everyone, and it was simple to make. Use the best Extra Virgin Oilve Oil you can find, the added dimention that super premium oil gives the recipe is crucial to taking this dish to the next level.

Very good. Next time, I will add the lime juice only at the very last minute so the tartar will keep its vivid colour (it paled a little bit due to the acidity of the juice). I chopped the fish a bit smaller than called for, but only for simplicity: while still frozen, made some regular big cubes of salmon and threw them into the food processor. In a few on/offs it was perfect.
