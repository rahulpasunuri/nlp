I love this recipe. I've had it in my recipe box since 2000, and I make it several times a year. I generally use some balsamic vinegar in the dressing. I like to throw in other roasted vegetables when in season to add body to the dish, but the peppers and onions alone are wonderful.

I make this every year when I have lots of colorful peppers. Easy and delicious

This is very, very tasty, and can be made ahead and served as leftovers. The rosemary and orange rind make this a very tasty dish. I used the balsamic vinegar. Guests suggested making it for their company, and I am making it again in a week, the leftovers dissappeared too fast.

Wanting a light meal I tried this for dinner last night. Can't say it is one that I would repeat. Although the orange peel added a unique flavor the quantity was too pungent so if you are going to try the recipe you might consider reducing the amount. Also, 35 minutes was too long to roast the chicken breasts. All in all just not a very satisfying salad.
