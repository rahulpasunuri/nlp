This recipe was absolutely delicious! I also fought with the crust, but finally set the bottom of the glass pie pan in hot water for about 2 minutes, and used a warmed metal spatula(that I also put in hot water) which made dishing it out much easier and the presentation much nicer. Will definately make this again!

i made the mistake of "liking" epi on facebook, where i now regularly see their tantalizing recipe photos posted. when this one came up, i knew i would have to make it for thanksgiving! i'd give it 4 forks for taste (and fun factor) but 3 for presentation; like the cook from ohio, i had a tough time with the crust sticking. i'm thinking of lining just the bottom of the pan with a little circle of parchment next time. however, the crust is worth the fight. absolutely delicious and different! i used "slow churned" vanilla bean ice cream to lighten it up a bit and it still tasted totally decadent. vanilla in the apple filling is awesome. to serve, i pre-sliced the pie, piled some room temp apples in the middle, and served the rest of the apples on the side. that way people could see what it was. guests LOVED it and there was none left!

Great recipe but crust stuck to my glass pie pan. Can anyone help?

This was an easy dessert to make and very tasty. The only thing I did different was to use cinnamon ice cream in place of the vanilla bean, as that is what I served in the past with my regular apple pie.

Was in search of a fall/autumn dessert to serve a crowd that needs gluten free and this fit the bill! Very easy to make and quite tasty. The only thing I would do differently next time (and there will be a next time), it to cut the apples into smaller pieces. My apples looked like the ones in the picture but felt like they were too large, that I had to cut them with the spoon before putting them into my mouth. Other than that, this is a simple, yet tasty dessert that can be made ahead and is easy to travel with (provided you don't have to go far as it is ice cream!)
