correction below - 1 1/2 cups of butter!

whenever i make these cookies, i have to make at least two batches - they go that fast! i accidentally made the recipe with an extra 1/2 cup of butter (whoops) and they turned out even better. i make the recipe with 2 1/2 cups butter every time now, gives it a nice crisp. i also add a little almond extract with the vanilla - gives it a nice round, nutty flavor. i highly recommend!

These cookies are too dry! I followed the recipe and even decreased the amount of oats by 1/2 cup! They were like rocks.

Subbed light brown sugar for dark, added extra walnuts, real salted butter, and used sea salt. I was trying to recreate a cookie from a bakery, this came pretty close. next time I will use extra salt, and try dark brown sugar. I will definitely make this again.

Always perfect, super quick and easy. I use dark chocolate chips and walnuts. Best with real butter.

I absolutely adore this recipe. Whenever I crave cookies, I make these. No additions or omissions, just exactly as the recipe says. (Although last batch I didn't have pecans so I substituted walnuts and that was tasty too!)

This is my go-to cookie recipe but have now tweaked it a bit to make it my own. I love chocolate but I think these cookies are better with raisins than choco chips. Dryness can be alleviated by using less of the oats by 1/2 cup and/or substituting 1 cup of the oats with Nature Valley Hemp Granola. I usually make these with unsalted butter and recommend adding salt to add flavor.

Just made a double batch for holiday gifts. These are fantastic cookies and everyone loves them. The batter is very hard to stir once you add the flour and oats but amazingly it does all come together. My only change is to add 1 tsp. of cinnamon. Yummy!!

These are very tasty cookies. I omitted the white sugar and salt and used salted butter. In also used only half of the chocolate chips. I added about 1T of orange juice to the mix also. I made the cookies larger and they came out like little scones. PERFECT texture and wonderful blend of flavors. They are on the drier side but go so well with a tall glass of cold milk or a cup of tea or joe :)

I think these are the best cookies on the planet, even without the pecans. They are easy and super delicious! I make them slightly oversized and cook them for about 15 minutes. They are chewy and perfect. FYI - I used 2 sticks of butter instead of margarine.

Crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle - perfect. Cooked them a little less than 14 minutes: about 10 - 12 min.

to correct the below review...I used 1 and one half sticks of butter and 1/4 cup of shortening....

Wow....I loved these cookies. However, I made a few adjustments. 1. I used 1 and 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening. 2. I only used 2T. white sugar and used loosely packed brown sugar. 3. Instead of 3/4 t. baking soda, I used 1/2t. baking soda and 1/2t. baking powder. 4. I used 1 and 1/2 c. oats. 5. I didn't chop the pecans...I measured out 1 c. of whole ones. And used only 1 c. of choco chips. The RESULT...amazingness. I also only cooked them for 13 min because I made them with a 1/4 c. scoop. They are ooey and gooey...and lovely. I like to do things a little different...but this is def a great recipe to experiment with...very forgiving.

These cookies are really good. I used unsalted butter and followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a keeper and pretty easy.

I followed the recipe exactly and the result was a cookie that my family loved. I watched them carefully and removed them from the oven as soon as they looked done - around 12 minutes - and they were chewy and delicious. I made a half batch - they were gone in no time.

Think of these cookies as mini-scones. I read the reviews and made a few changes. I prefer butter to margarine knowing that it would make them drier. Eliminated the white sugar, as I don't like very sweet cookies. Used regular oats instead of quick-cooking for more texture. Substituted dried cranberries for one cup of the chocolate chips. Loved the mixture of the oats, chips, berries and nuts. However, it is a dry cookie, so it's perfect for a breakfast scone or anytime with a cup of coffee.

After reading reviews I omitted the white sugar completely, substituted 1/2 c. flour with wheat flour, and used butter. I like my oatmeal cookies oaty, but these were a little dry. they need some moisture, maybe milk? they are definitely sweet enough with just 1 c. of sugar, next time I'll cut oats to 1 3/4 c. and sub. some oil for the butter.

Great cookies. I used 1 1/2 cups oats, 1 cup coconut, and 1 cup chocolate chips. No nuts. Tasted great this way.

Wow, this recipe is terrific! I made a double batch, and after reading all reviews, decided that in addition to butter (what I had on hand), I added about 2-3 tablespoons walnut oil to make up for the qualities of the margarine. I also only used 2 c of oatmeal (per batch), but could have easily added more. The 14 minute time was perfect, but I was using level ice cream scoop portions,and flattened them slightly which worked perfectly. Also, semi-sweet chocolate chunks were used, which fared well for the super sized cookies. A great recipe, I will add it to my repitore!

I used butter and added tart dry cherries, also used banana extract instead of vanilla. I also recommend to cut oats and chocolate chips to 1/3 of what is recommended here. I gave this recipe out to most of my girlfriends since they all loved it!

I used butter and omitted 1/2 cup of the oats and the dough was still a little dry. The flavor was good, although if I make them again I'll omit more oats and maybe add some ginger. I like them without the nuts. A nice, chewy cookie.

I am 7 years old and i made these cookies all by myself. They're really good, I ate 2! I used cashews instead of pecans because I do not like any nuts except cashews. I chopped up about 2/3 of a cup.

I love this recipe! I am a chocolate chip cookie lover and have searched long and hard for the perfect recipe. The oatmeal in these keeps the cookies chewier, which I like. The only changes I make to the recipe are: 1) I use butter, 2) I omit the pecans (my husband doesn't like nuts), and 3) I press the cookie into discs before cooking because they don't spread well for me. All resulting in the perfect cookie!

I left out the pecans due to a child's nut allergy, left out the orange, but added 1/2 c. dried cranberries, and 1/8 tsp ground ginger. They were delicious. Great texture. Chewy on the inside and just crisp on the outside.

A good, simple recipe that will certainly satisfy the desire for cookies but won't send anyone over the moon. I did use the dark brown sugar and I added 1 t. of cinnamon and 1/2 t. of nutmeg because I really wanted oatmeal cookies with chocolate. I agree that they are a bit too sweet, and I should have followed my instincts when I started adding the sugar - I think you could leave out most if not all of the white sugar and still have a nice result. I used unsalted butter and I'm a bit surprised to read all the grumbling about margarine in the recipe - hello, there are people out there who use margarine for religious reasons.

For someone who rarely bakes, I must say these cookies came out pretty darn good... I used others recommendations...butter, light brn sugar, no oatmeal and baked cookies for 12minutes, they actually came out chewy and really good.

These honestly are the best cookies I have ever eaten. Every time I make them, everyone asks for the recipe...they don't last long in my house or at work!! Use butter instead of maragrine...b/c really in my mind margarine has no place in the baking world! Also use light brown sugar instead, a bit extra vanilla. Also cut the oats back to 2 cups instead, otherwise the cookies are too hard and dry. I cut back the chocolate chips to 1 cup b/c I find them too sweet with too make chips. Usually the cookies only take about 11 minutes in the over...be sure to watch them carefully. I love these moist and chewy cookies. I hope they work out as well for all of you!!!

Instead of margarine, used butter, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, cut back on the oats by about 1/3 of a cup, and toasted the pecans... Though I didn't have any vanilla handy, I threw in a good tablespoon of nutella at with the butter and sugar. These are amazing!

Made this recipe with bittersweet chips, all I had, walnuts and old fashioned oatmeal. HUGE hit. The unusual chocolate works fabulously! Had to dole them out so they wouldn't all be gone. Have another package of said chips, so I will make another batch. Who doesn't love CC cookies?

I cut oats by 1/2 cup and used medium weight instead of quick cooking. I also used sea salt, natural sugar instead of refined, Earth Balance sticks instead of regular margarine/butter, and chopped walnuts instead of pecans. The result was amazing. The cookies were full of chocolate, nuts and oats. I am going to try making them next time with a bit of coconut which I think would add even more delicious flavor. I finally have a worthy oatmeal/ chocolate chip/nut cookie recipe.

These are just a slight twist from the standard oatmeal raisin cookies I've always made. I really enjoyed the addition of pecans. I was skeptical of using all of the recommended chocolate chips, thinking it looked very loaded with chocolate. I witheld some for the first batch I baked. I found that they really didn't need the rest, but per my husband's request, I added them and figured he'd eat most (if not all) of them anyway. I baked my cookies for 12-13 minutes.

This is a great cookie! I wanted to try it b/c I loved these cookies from Olive's-a little sandwich shop in Soho. For the infrequent baker, the dough may seem unwieldy by the time you add all the ingredients but don't be concerned! This is a perfect example of the more the better! I did make some alterations after a few times. I've always used butter (a little less than what the recipe says) and walnuts instead of pecans.

I just popped these out of the oven and have eaten three of them already! I decreased the sugar and used half white and half demerara, used spelt flour, and added raisins and dried cranberries in place of most of the nuts. Yummy!

I LOVE these cookies! I chose this recipe to try baking non-dairy cookies for a friend of mine. I used butter flavored crisco, which I softened in the microwave and I also added about a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and the cookies were fabulous! Definately not dry or hockey puck-ish! Next time, I am going to use half crisco, half butter, both softened and use walnuts instead of pecans, but I think that this is now my best chocolate chip cookie recipe!

I altered the recipe a bit and used real butter, semi-sweet chocolate chunks (instead of chips)--more than the recipe called for, no nuts and entered the cookies in a chocolate chip cookie contest at work and won 2nd prize. Next time around I will use nuts and add raisins or dried cherries to the recipe.

Terrific recipe. I increased the vanilla (used Mexican) to a full tablespoon. Also, as suggested by previous users, I used only 2 cups oats, used light brown sugar (instead of dark brown), used butter (instead of margarine), and baked for only 12 minutes (instead of 14). In the future, I'll decrease the baking time further, to ~11 minutes.

This wasn't a "WOWser!!" recipe. Seemed to have something missing, taste wise. I made the recipe exactly to order, then cut the dough in 1/2.

Just finished making the cookies and my husband and I are disappointed in the results. I guess I was looking for an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe, instead of a chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal and pecans. Followed the recipe except I took the advice of previous cooks and only used 2 cups of oatmeal and omitted the pecans. Cookies were neither chewy nor flavourful; edible, but not exceptional.

Very good cookie recipe. I used butter instead of flour, walnuts instead of pecans and regular oats instead of quick cooking oats since these were the ingredients I had at home. I followed earlier advice and just used 2 cups of oats, which was more than enough. I packaged them and gave them to my co-workers for Christmas and I got rave reviews!

Great cookies! Baked exactly as written the first time, then took the advice of A Cook from Baltimore MD - reduced oats to 2 cups and decreased cooking time to 12 minutes - which made them moister and chewier. Used butter instead of margarine and walnuts instead of pecans. These cookies are already a family favorite.

We omitted white sugar and used dark chocolate chunks and walnuts. The cookies were beautiful looking, but too dry and not rich enough for our taste. There is no way that many oats can be absorbed gracefully into the batter. These made nice hockey pucks for the cats.

Good but not perfect. Needs modification. Baking at 12 mins. as suggested by some is good advice. Also needs more salt and think I will use light brown sugar next time because the strong molasses flavor detracts attention from pecans. Will also keep pecans whole and increase amount. Try flattening with fork before baking and the effect of the nuts will be more pronounced.

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe. I omitted the 1/2 c white sugar since I found that the 1 c brown sugar was enough to make the cookies sweet but not too sweet. (I used Egg Replacer and was able to taste the batter before baking which you can't do if you use real eggs.) I baked them for 12 minutes and they were delicious right out of the oven!

Rating: 4
This is a great cookie! If you want them to come out a little chewier then only bake them for 12 minutes. They'll look like they're not done yet but once they're out of the oven, leave them on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes then transfer them to a cooling rack. I promise they'll come out chewier. I used my baking stone (you can get them from Pampered Chef) and they turned out awesome! I'll definitely make them again.
