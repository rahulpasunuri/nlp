I sauteed my shallots in bacon fat. I failed to put the baking dish in a pan of shallow water and regretted it ... although the recipe doesn't call for it, most souffle recipes do, and it's a good idea (to avoid overbrowning the bottom). I can totally see pairing with a ham. Yummy.

This recipe was very bland. I used Gruyere cheese instead of Gouda, but I don't think that was the reason for it to came out so insipid. I think it needs more spinach and more cheese. Good thing I did a tasting before cooking it for guests. Very disappointing.

What a great dish but I made a few revisions. First I substituted the Smoked Gouda for equal parts Gouda and Gruyere. Second, used fresh spinach rather than frozen. I added the fresh spinach to the soft shallots and added 1/4 to 1/3 cup of dry white wine and reduced until moisture was gone. I also added a little thyme and summer savory to the chopped shallots&and olive oil rather than butter to sauté. Finally, I only added a sprinkle of nutmeg. The last bit of advice for this recipe is&dont allow anyone near the oven until the soufflé is set. Other wise, you will have a perfect casserole like we did! It was the hit at Christmas dinner.

I used this as a basis for a vegetarian entree. I added a second box of spinach and 2 boxes of mushrooms that I processed in my food processor until finely ground. I then sauteed the mushrooms in butter with thyme until the moisture was evaporated. I mixed the mushroom mixture with the spinach and shallots and substituted gruyere for the gouda. My vegetarian guests loved it and it will remain as a regular to my holiday meal.

Great recipe. We substituted goat cheese gouda for a creamier flavor. Very difficult to tell when the souffle had set, and we watched in dismay as our souffle deflated into a casserole. Rich and delicious regardless!

This was really easy to make and it went over very nicely. I thought the smoked Gouda was a little overpowering but we all liked the flavor of the cheese so it wasnt bothersome. Not very spinach-y. I would much rather try fresh spinach next time to bring that flavor out more. Also try a variety of soft cheeses. The Parmesan sounds good albeit a little salty. This would work well at a variety of occasions too. Definitely a keeper!

Did not turn out that great for me but could be because I overcooked it.

I couldn't keep my fingersout of the rue mixture after I added the Gouda! The only detour I made from the script was a puffed pastry shell bottom and fresh spinach that I wilted in the pan with the sauted shallot. Oh Yea, I increased the salt and pepper to my taste! Very good!

This was great and I lightened it. First of all, I halved the recipe and it worked well. I used evaporated fat free milk instead of whole milk and used olive oil to saute the shallots. I also used fresh spinach and that worked as well. The next time I make this I think I will add garlic to the shallot saute, use a little less nutmeg than called for and use parmesan cheese on top instead of the smoked gouda. The gouda didn't melt and brown as well on top as I thought. Overall a great dish!

I loved making this dish. Simple and very impressive! Don't change anything.

Don't change a thing, this is the perfect sophisticated side for a special meal. Anyone saying otherwise probably wasn't prepared for handling this dish with everything else--it does take special timing and treating this as a souffle that it is. If you can juggle that, this is OUTSTANDING. I made when it was orginally published in the magazine, and is on my top tier recipe list for my special holidays.

I made this for Xmas dinner and it went really well with our ham and the rest of the meal. The dark brown crust of the cheese became a little plasticy and didn't melt too well on top of the souflee and was also heavy, so it didn't rise much, but the flavors were good.

I made this for supper and it was delicious. I hate nutmeg, so I substituted chopped fresh herbs. I also added some sundried tomatoes and red pepper flakes as recommended. I cannot see how this yummy dish can be tasteless unless you use very inferior ingredients. I tasted the spinach mixture before I folded in the egg whites to check the seasoning.

This souffle was so good we're having the leftovers for breakfast! I didn't find it work intensive because it was our main course for dinner. But if I served it as a side dish, I'd keep the ham, chicken, fish, whatever, very uncomplicated. Also, go easy on the salt in the souffle if serving ham. I saved on pot washing by sauteeing the shallots in the full amount of butter, then adding the other ingredients as listed, but of course heating the milk in another pan. No lumps at all in the sauce. My souffle rose nicely because I sprinkled the sides of the baking dish with grated Parmesan. Dried bread crumbs would have worked as well I think. Tweaked the recipe with 1/4 tsp. of dry mustard and a few shots of hot sauce. Excellent company dish for brunch, lunch or dinner. Would have rated it 3 1/2 forks if possible.

Smelled heavenly when baking and we weren't let down by the flavors. Brought this for a dinner at a friend's Easter dinner yesterday and really was enjoyed by all. The only change I made was using smoked Swiss cheese and it was terrific! Do try! KIMBER

This is an easy dish to make. It has a rich creamy flavor from the smoked gouda. I used fresh spinach in place of frozen. The fresh spinach weighed in at 15oz after removing thick stems to yield the 10oz of after wilting. This was 3 " bunch's" at the market. This was a hit a xmas dinner my kids loved it !! Spinach is now off the yuckie list. The other thing I did different was in the preparation of the sauce. I cooled the butter flour ( white roux ) to room temp before adding it to the warm milk. It mixes easier with no lumping. A general rule when using a roux is to have the roux cool and the liquid hot. It works in reverse but usually the sauce is to be heated to cook the flour so warm liquid speeds the process. I also used clarified butter for the roux. Enjoy

I made this as a side dish with ham...even my father, who doesn't like spinach, had seconds. I'll definitely make this again.

An easy and very satisfying dish. My dinner guests (who scraped the bowl) wouldn't believe there was no bacon in it -- the smokiness of the cheese gives it such a robust taste. This definitely goes in the recipe box.

This was an excellent dish. I tweaked it a little by adding some sun dried tomatoes that I chopped and added to the spinach. It gave this dish a nice balance of depth and flavor. My guests are still raving about this two weeks later.

I made this for Thanksgiving and again for a dinner party before X-mas. Nothing but rave reviews. It is a little time consuming with prep work, but well worth it. This is a great change from the boring creamed spinach recipe.

We were disappointed in this recipe. I felt the flavors were very unbalanced and did not blend well. Although I love smoked gouda, the smokey flavor definitely overpowered this dish. Maybe next time I'll try it with a cheddar or a baby swiss.

My family (including two teens) loved this recipe. The smoked gouda added a nice flavor. It was rich and filling enough for a main course w/o meat.

This was and excellent dish. Be sure to make extra for guests that ask for more. I've made this a few times and my only suggestion is to be sure you are using a good quality gouda, otherwise the cheese can taste a little waxy in the souffle. This is also yummy with smoked cheddar.

Absolutely delicious--makes a perfect spring dinner with a side of mesclun salad, french bread, and chardonnay. If you're going to enjoy this as a main course, though, the recipe only serves four, not eight.

I served this to our gourmet group and they loved it. The smoked cheese was the key. I couldn't find smoked gouda but found something similar but definitely smoked. I used the rind from the cheese which was edible but contained most of the smoked flavor. Try it you'll love it.

I served this to guests without practicing first..my result was a delicious! It was the perfect consistency and works very well if you prepare it with a balloon wisk from W-Sonoma. The leftovers the next day are fabulous(if there are any) and the flavor intensfies. Try this one for sure!

This is a great recipe, but I did make a few changes. I cut out about 1/3 of the butter, used skim milk instead of whole, and doubled the spinach. It's less of a souffle that way, but healthier. I think a layer of roasted red peppers on top would be excellent.
