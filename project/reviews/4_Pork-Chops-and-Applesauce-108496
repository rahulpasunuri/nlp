Used buttermilk in place of milk. Deleted sugar from the sauce, since apples were sweet enough. In fact, would add "Better Than Bullion" to water next time. Found the sauce cloyingly sweet otherwise.

Made a few times now and really enjoy. Typically half the recipe, using gluten-free bread crumbs and adding cinnamon to the applesauce. The pork and apples are just a great combination - this is a favorite weeknight dinner.

This is the second time I made these pork chops. As others have noted, you can use anything for crumbs. This time I used 2 Italian rolls that were in my freezer. I used a whole but small bulb of garlic and twice the rosemary, as I had the time but no thyme. ;) My 9 chops were fairly thick, so I fried them 3 at a time in a cast iron pan on 5-6 on my electric stove. Like others noted, it takes longer with thicker chops, and I kept them warm in a 300 degree oven and then the 2 of us ate the first-done and left the others in a 200 degree oven which will be our leftovers! Well, all I can say is, if you don't love these, then you either don't love pork with rosemary and garlic or you can't follow directions! They are simply delicious. For anyone who put the chops in milk with good intentions to make them then didn't get to them until the next day, no worries! Last time I made this fabulous applesauce, my favorite ever, but this time I found I did not have any apples, so I heated a ripe mango with some grated, fresh ginger and a little cinnamon. Yummy! I served with mashed sweet potatoes and string beans. Note that it is time-consuming to finish the 3 batches, so next time I will be sure to use cutlets or slice thicker ones into 2 as some did.

We LOVED this recipe. Minor changes: I used a food mill to make the applesauce, a method I love, but it would work just as well as written. For the pork chops, I subbed Panko for the fresh bread crumbs (thanks to a previous reviewer), otherwise I followed the recipe. We LOVED the results - the chops were nicely seasoned, and were cooked to perfection. The applesauce is not too sweet, and pairs well with the pork. Everything came together easily once I'd marinated the chops and prepped the breading; I wouldn't hesitate to make this for company, especially casual friends who don't mind chatting in the kitchen while dinner is in the final stages of preparation. LOVE this!

Great and easy! I used oil - left out the butter. Added a little extra garlic. So moist and delicious! I did notice the breadcrumbs came off a little when frying so I may use an egg wash next time.

This is a great new way to dazzle up pork chops. It was delicious...hint of herbs and garlic in every bite with a little bit of crunch from the bread crumbs. The only thing that I modified was the method of cooking it. I pan fried it for a couple of mins on each side to get it brown and crispy and finished it in the oven (to prevent the bread crumbs from burning/ blackening).

My new favorite way to cook pork chops. Something about marinating them in milk makes them stay incredibly juicy and delicious instead of drying out the way they usually do. I always use panko instead of of fresh breadcrumbs and the chops come out deliciously crunchy. The first time I tried this recipe I made my normal, sweet applesauce to go with it. It was fine, but I've since realized that the savory applesauce in this recipe is an even better accompaniment. My family is always excited when I tell them I'm making this recipe!

Hello Everyone, I'm new to the site and this is the first recipe I have tried. I did not make the applesauce, but I LOVE the chops. I followed the recipe, using fresh herbs. I let the chops marinate for 2 1/2 hours. I saw on the reviews that some used non stick and some used cast Iron. I have both so I did some in each. I have to say the non stick chops were much better. They were less greasy and for some reason the cast iron made the meat a bit tougher. Next time I will do them all in my non stick. As for those who had too many bread crumbs, I had just enough for my 6 chops. I used 10 slices of white bread. My bread crumbs were very soft when I coated the chops.I thought maybe they would be too soft but not so, they turned out great and I will always use fresh herbs and the milk marinade from now on!One more thing, I had potatoes in the oven so I could not set it to 200 to keep the chops warm, so instead I put my electric griddle next to the stove with a platter on top set to 200. As I removed the chops I put them on the warm platter and covered them to keep warm.Worked like a charm. I also made some pan gravy with the drippings but we ended up not even needing it the chops were so moist.

Rating: 3
Not a 4 forker but definitely great comfort food. I was looking for a way to use up some apples that were past their prime and this was a great use. The savory twist to the applesauce was a great side to the pork chops. I hate wasting food so used the milk to make gravy with the pan drippings. Served it with some smashed potatoes made with buttermilk and chives. A great fall meal!!

Rating: 4
Oh my gosh, this was so easy and good! Juicy, tender and tasty! My only change was to use dried Italian seasoning instead of fresh herbs because that's what I had on hand. The seasoning also held up better in the fry pan as I used thicker chops and they needed to cook longer. The applesauce was outstanding, and I normally detest applesauce. I served roasted fennel and carrots on the side. (Recipe is on this site.)

This is the first time I give a 4 star review for pork chops because they never turn out good but this time, they were just awesome. I used schar Gluten Free bread crumbs because my son has Celiac. The pork chops turned out great so if you have a friend who has Celiac or has an allergy to wheat, you should make this recipe. BTW, I used 3.5 apples.

Ah, a pork dish where the pork isn't dry and tough! I recommend a low heat on an electric stove - maybe 4 or 5 - so the bread crumbs don't burn and the pork cooks through. I used one dinner roll and that was enough bread crumbs for 1/2 lb (2 pieces) or pork. Easy and delicious. I didn't make the applesauce as I had an apple chutney on hand. I'll try it next time!

I made this recipe for my picky family, and we all loved it. The pork chops were great and cooked incredibly fast. First, it is important to note that this recipe calls for 1/2 inch thick pork chops. These would also be called "thin sliced" at many places. If you get thicker pork chops, you are going to want to cook them on a lower temperature for a longer time. Mine were exactly 1/2 inch thick and cooked so fast I could hardly believe it. It is also important to note that they USDA revised their recommended cooking temperature for pork this year, and now say that 145 degrees is a safe temperature. This means that there can be some pink. This does not include ground pork, but it does go for pork chops! www.fsis.usda.gov/news/NR_052411_01/index.asp Also, I didn't have any fresh bread crumbs, but Panko bread crumbs worked great. I made my own applesauce and didn't stick to the recipe in that regard, because I happen to have a method that I like. When I was kid, when my mom didn't have time to make her own applesauce, she just heated up some from the jar in the fridge, which isn't as good, but I think it is okay in a pinch. I used 3 apples for 3 people, and had just enough sauce. My family loved this recipe, and I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe- but ***cook at lower heat!**** Medium high doesn't work- it leaves the juices pink and the bread crumbs black . I played with it, and it seems like 4 on my electric range (1/3 of the way to high) works best.

My father loves pork chops and these were such a hit that he asked if he could please take the leftovers home. I used a combination of potato buns and wheat bread for the crumbs and soaked the pork overnight. I did not peel the apples and instead of a fork, used an immersion blender for the applesauce. Success! These are "saved" to my box and we will make them again!

Rating: 1
Sigh! Just another recipe for pork chops that can't give a correct time to cook just like all the rest. 5 min PER SIDE wasn't enough nevermind per BATCH. So it's just cook away hoping the bread crumbs don't burn as you cook your way to something less than bloody raw.

The pork chops were very moist. I didn't have a food processor to make the bread crumbs. I never had made applesauce before but it turned out pretty good despite adding more sugar to the recipe by accident. Interesting how I never had warm applesauce before. Quite tasty. 3 1/2 forks !

Awesome and easy! I used soy milk which works equally as well. I buy the large pork loin from Costco then cut up my pork chops individually. this way I can use small chops for recipes that call for frying so I get that nice crispy outer coating while still getting the chop cooked through. This was delicious!

After years of making dried out center cup pork chops I finally made one that was completely delicious. Didn't make the applesauce, had some chutney. Just did the milk marinade and the bread crumbs (trader joes packaged bread crumbs) some fresh rosemary and thyme and six or seven minutes in the frying pan. They were yummy and will definitely do again!

Made this for the in-laws on New Year's Day. Complete success! Great recipe for introducing people to a little more flavor than they may be accustomed to.

OMG...delicious! I used store bought breadcrumbs, but otherwise exactly the same ingredients. My pork chops were also closer to an inch or thicker, so I did medium heat and cooked much longer.

I made this dish this evening. I made everything as instructed except I used Fuji apples for the applesauce because that is what I had on hand. I used dried herbs and store-bought plain breadcrumbs in a can (not fresh). I also let the applesauce cook longer than instructed and put the apples (after they were cooked) through a ricer. A stick blender would have been ideal but I don't have one. Don't be a dummy like me and be careless if you decide to puree or rice your cooked applesauce. I burned myself. This recipe, pork chops and applesauce, is delicious. My entire family loved it. Watch the breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs can brown very quickly. I cooked the chops on medium heat. I will definitely make this again.

Chops are terrific, but I'm not a fan of the apple sauce. The flavor of the applesauce is good but the texture is mooshy and weird. OK yes, I've admittedly grown up on bottled apple sauce. I'll definitely make the chops again and serve with warmed up store-bought applesauce with a bit of allspice and cinnamon thrown in.

I'm only reviewing the applesauce, which I used with the Pan Roasted Pork Chops with Cranberries and Red Swiss Chard recipe. The applesauce was amazing and easy especially if you use your food processor to chop. It took twice as long to boil down though. Will definitely make again with the aforementioned pork recipe.

It took me a few batches to get the hang of this recipe but it was delicious when mastered! My crumb topping kept coming off the meat when it was cooked, so I would recommend cooking the pork on medium heat. It takes a little while longer, but it's worth it in the end. I only had about five slices of whole wheat Dempster's bread on hand, and it still made way too much crumb mixture, so I would cut the amount of bread in half, but leave the same amount of herbs and garlic. It makes for a delicious chop! I also didn't have time to make the applesauce so I used unsweetened organic applesauce from a jar - it was still good. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

Simple and Savory. I use my giant extra large 9x13 electric frying pan and can fit six thick nice chops. A nice touch to this recipe is to add a can of well drained tart cherries to the apples. I use the tart cherry juice from the can to the liquid measurement with the cherry gelatin for a Jell-O Parfait with this dinner using cherry and lime flavors. For us, this recipe has to have either mashed potatoes or scalloped potatoes, and fresh steamed green beans. HOMEY Dinner Deluxe!

The pork is delicious; a sort of modern take on a staple from a bygone era. BUT it's the applesauce that rocks it hard. It's a fresh departure from the typical cinnamon spiced variety. I can barely get if out of the saucepan and onto the table before it's gone. And it's an ideal convalescing food. A pot of homemade chicken soup and this applesauce cures just about everything.

The pork chops here are classic. The applesauce is easy and fabulous. Together they got rave reviews. The only thing I don't get is why so much bread crumbs (3.5 cups)? Surely that dilutes the other ingedients, and much was unused. Next time I'll go with less and see how that works.

Mmmmmmmm... Yummy! Whole Foods only had the double-thick pork chops, so I fried them just enough to crisp up the outside -- about 4 minutes on each side -- and then I put them in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Really juicy and delicious!

Nevermind the applesauce, the star of the show are the chops and they're the best I've ever made - tops even Mom's, which has long been a family favorite. Keep your marinade time to no more than 3-4 hours, otherwise the pork absorbs too much salt and there is no substitute for fresh herbs, ever and they make all the difference.

This is my go to pork chop recipe. The fresh bread crumbs really makes a big difference. I make mine whole wheat bread instead of white.

I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this, I opted for chops when I couldn't find veal in the freezer.

I wasn't as crazy about this recipe as a lot of other people were. I would probably prefer a thick-cut, bone-in, brined and grilled pork chop any day. It's easier, tastier, and healthier. In any case, I did think that this was the best applesauce that I've managed to make (I usually mess it up.) The applesauce may seem like an inconsequential part of the meal, but I think that the pork and applesauce together are delicious. Also, it's better the next day, so don't cut it in half for fewer people. Which reminds, me--two of us ate almost this whole recipe, although I did use very thin pork cutlets. If you're stuck inside I would suggest trying this recipe. Otherwise, do what I suggested above.

Just fabulous! I made the applesauce with the apples I happened to have - I don't know what type they were except to say they had red skin. The applesauce turned out great! I used the bread crumbs I happened to have (I think panko but I am not sure as they were just in a storage container in the refrigerator), and I had pork loin butterfly chops, which are quite thick. I cooked them in the pan and then put them in a 190 degree (Celsius) oven for about 20 minutes because they were getting too brown in the pan. I suggest you serve this with very colourful food because the brownish applesauce and the brown chops (and I made thin fried potatoes, also brown!) made for a very boring looking (but truly delicious) plate.

Rating: 4
These are my favorite pork chops. It's important to use fresh herbs and thin chops. I've left them in the milk mixture overnight with no problems. I recommend a good stainless steel or heavy non-stick pan (not a cast iron skillet) so the delicate coating doesn't burn. I prefer a light olive oil to the vegetable oil. Blended with the melted, unsalted butter it is wonderfully rich as it soaks into the coating of fresh bread crumbs.

I bought bone-in french trimmed chops from Trader Joes and used Panko bread crumbs. I didn't want to burn the crust so finished in the oven and the result was delicious.

NOTE to less-than-expert people like myself: If the pork chop is thicker, it will take much longer to cook. Other than that experience (everyone sitting at the table and the meat isn't ready for another 20 minutes...), these were tasty and moist. Basically followed the recipe except cut it in half. A bit time-consuming for a weeknight dinner, since the chops need to marinate and be flipped before cooking, and it's not something I would serve to company, but worth it if you have the time and some ADEQUATELY THIN chops!

The pork chops were great... my 11 and 8 year old cleaned their plates. I added more garlic then in the recipe. And I had to cook it longer -- I'll cover the pan next time to keep the heat in. Haven't made the apple sauce yet, but will do that once apple season starts. Definately a keeper.

I am reviewing the pork portion of this recipe since my fiancée doesn't care for applesauce. I soaked the chops in milk (2%) for 4 hours. I had 6 pieces of pork (1.3 pounds or so total), each just under a half inch thick. Since I was leery of just dredging in the crumbs without my usual flour and egg, I did some of the pieces with flour, egg wash and breadcrumbs and some with just breadcrumbs. There was virtually no difference and the "just breadcrumbs" was much less messy. The pork was incredibly juicy and tender - a far cry from the shriveled chops with which I grew up. I sautéed them for 3 minutes on each side and since they still needed a few more minutes but were plenty browned, I covered the pan and popped it into a 350 oven for about 5 minutes. They had just a hint of pink in the center (yes, this is safe with pork) and were fabulous. I added lots of extra black pepper to the breadcrumbs for some more zip.

My family is watching calories, so I made some adjustments to this recipe and it turned out great!

The meat was flavorful and juicy, and the fresh rosemary made the dish.

Thanks to the moms who reviewed this, I made it for dinner -- my 3 & 5 year-olds loved the pork (I cut it in strips before cooking, for 'chicken fingers'); 8-month old loved the applesauce. I took another's suggestion & made a pan sauce by deglazing w/ white wine & a little butter, for husband and me. Wasn't planning on making the applesauce, but reading the reviews while the meat was marinading changed my mind. I didn't have high hopes; I usually have unsweetened applesauce, but this was easy, really good & not too sweet, and made my kitchen smell oh-so-homey. Didn't have any allspice so used a little cinnamon & nutmeg instead. I can see this being a regular in my kitchen.

Family loved it. Kids raved on the applesauce, and I was delighted since this was the first time I have ever made applesauce. Used 8-grain bagels for the breadcrumbs, and the chops were the best we've had.

My family enjoyed this one! Warm, comfort food, easy to prepare and delicious to boot. Fresh herbs are the key to delicious breadcrumb costing.

I usually avoid pork chops thinking they will be tough and dry but these were great. Mine were a little thicker so I finished them off in the oven to avoid drying them out. Next time I think I'll deglaze the pan with a little white wine and butter. A very easy and quick meal, which I need since I have a 9 week old!

my husband & i both enjoyed this pork dish very much i would make it again it was a very easy recipe i made only one change i used ready made flavored breadcrumbs

Loved the pork chops, although it took longer than 5-6 minutes to cook them; perhaps mine were thicker than they should have been. They were very moist, as others described, and the bread coating was very flavorful and delicious. I disagree with another reader about using just any apple for the applesauce... I think it's really important to use a particular variety that is suitable for applesauce. I had "pink lady" apples and I don't think they made for good applesauce at all..too dry and didn't fall apart. We'll definitely make this again, this time with different apples.

The pork chops were delicious - so tender and tasty. Everyone loved them - the seasoning in the bread crumbs, just the right amount of frying, etc. The applesauce: cut apples in quarters, place in pan with a little water, skin, seeds and all. Run through a food mill when cooked. I use two or three diff. types of apples e.g., granny smith, courtland, fuji, etc. SO EASY - I MAKE THIS EVERY TIME WE HAVE PORK. I will make the pork chops forever.

I made this recipe last night. It is the best pork chop recipe ever! My husband loves applesauce with his pork. He really, really loved this home made version. The pork chops were the most tender that I or my husband have ever had. This is a recipe that I will be making again and again. Can't wait to serve it to family and friends. Thanks epicurious!!

Made this as written and whole family loved it. Will definitely make again, and probably relatively often. Hated preping the apples, but the applesauce was outstanding. I would serve to company. It's not formal, but it sure tastes good.

YEEEE--UUUMMMM!!! I have used this recipe over and over again! As for the bread crumbs: I have used raisin english muffins that were hours from little green spots, hamburger buns, croissants from France, bagels, squaw bread...ANYTHING works!!! Now I just pulse leftover bread-products in the Cuisinart and toss into a Zip-Lock baggie in the freezer for instant breadcrumbs. Same with the apples: Anything goes...Fuji, Gala, Macintosh...whatever's on the trees! And marinate those chops as long as possible in milk OR buttermilk! This recipe is in the TOP FIVE for my family of five! (...jus' kidding about the France part....)

This is a great recipe!! I didn't make the applesauce, I used my own but I will definitely try it next time. The pork was so tender and flavorful.

My husband said this was the best pork chop he'd ever eaten - incredibly moist. I marinated in the milk for 4 hours and after frying finished in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes. The applesauce was so easy to make and tasted so good served warm with the pork chops. I'll make this recipe again and again.

We absolutely loved the pork chops. I used a baguette instead of white sandwich bread for the crumbs and it was great. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and was very happy with the dish. (I didn't make the applesauce, I served the pork chops with a nice salad instead...so good.)

Why do the pork chops need to marinate in milk/salt for an hour? Just curious about the need for the "hour" in that step...does it really make a difference? How do you think buttermilk would work in place of regular milk?

This is one of thoses recipes that just says "home". Great comfort food. Easy and delicious which makes it a keeper. Applesauce was quick and yummy..I wont be buying store brands again.And who didnt have a crush on Peter Brady?

Every thing was perfect! Except I used fat free buttermilk to marinate the pork chops with fresh dill and garlic. Talk about a tangy dish. hmmmmm. I don't think my folks had porkchops like this before!

This applesauce is great! A little time-consuming, but really tasty. I also loved the pork chops, although I made the recipe with dried herbs, and I think it would have been even better with fresh ones.

Whenever I mention pork chops, my husband cringes as so often recipes can dry out the chops. Not this time! He was ranting all the way through the meal. Made Dave's Tomato & Cucumber Salad with it ... the perfect meal!

I never thought about marinating pork in milk. The pork came out really tender and juicy. The herb coating was delicious. Will be making this one again for sure!

We really enjoy this pork chop recipe. The milk marinade makes it moist and tender, and the herb/crumb coating is quite nice. Tried the herbed corn/couscous side with this, and it made a lovely combination.

Surprisingly good. Soaked the chops about an hour at room temperature. One of my best chops yet. I didn't know I liked applesauce until I made this. Very easy.

This was a great meal to cook on the weekdays, when your busy. The apple chopping took anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. Its just a nice simple family meal! I would make again baby yeah!!

Great quick pork chop recipe. Very moist. I always make my own applesauce, but decided to try this recipe. I loved it - much less sugar than my old recipe.

An easy and wonderful way to make pork chops. The milk marinade makes it deliciously tender. I used rosemary flatbread to make the crumb coating and it was fabulous. Also fewer carbs than breadcrumbs.

I really loved the pork chops. Did not make the applesauce which was ok. Not big on apples. I only used breadcrumbs and garlic and marinated it for 3 hours. The pork was so tender and juicy. Served it with salad, steamed brocolli and ziti with marinara sauce.

The applesauce, with the raisins in it, was so good it reminded me of apple-pie. So the next day, I rewarmed the left-over applesauce, & spooned it over some Ben & Jerry's vanilla ice cream. GREAT! Just like pie with no crust! And fewer calories, too. But the pork chops were too greasy.

I made this recipe tonight for the first time (omitting the applesauce) and these were, hands down, the best pork chops I have ever made! I used very thin boneless pork cutlets. I found with the thin meat, that I did not need three-and-a-half cups of bread crumbs like the recipe calls for. I only used 1 cup. I used 1 tsp. of minced garlic instead of a tablespoon. I stuck to the recipe on all other measurements. It was absolutely delicious!!! My husband and kids loved it! My (picky) 10-year old son told me to make it "once a week!" This recipe is definitely a keeper! :)

didnt make the applesauce but the pork chops were great. I used panko crumbs and added some grated parm and served with buttered new potatoes. I think the key is to use thin chops. Very flavorful coating. Will definitely make again.

Wow! This recipe is as great as most reviewers described! It's a keeper in our family! I added two more cloves of garlic and used store bought bread crumbs. As anyone ever tried marinating chicken in milk?

Excellent recipe. Probably the most moist pork chops we've had. Used Panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) and because the chops were thicker than 1/2 inch, finished them in the oven as suggested earlier. The use of fresh herbs and the addition of a little parmesean make this our new favorite way to prepare pork chops.

This was delicious. I used thicker chops and then just put them into a 350 oven for 10 minutes at the end. This is my standard pork chop recipe now.

Pretty good, but not the best pork chops I've ever made. Not sure if I would bother with this recipe again.

I rarely give out 4 forks and the idea of marinating chops in milk made me a little sick, but I trusted the other reviewers and thank god I did! These chops were awesome. I had four thick chops and pounded them out. The key to this recipe is thin chops! My flame was a little high so the outside cooked very quickly. I just put them in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes and they were perfect. Used fresh breadcrumbs and will try adding parmesan cheese next time for even more flavor! Did not try the applesauce, but eventually will.

I've been lurking around this site for a while and have never been inclined to register and rate a recipe until now. These chops were awesome! I used fresh french bread crumbs-very tasty. Leftover bread crumbs were great on Chicken Parmesan! Applesauce is delicious! Both definite keeper recipes!

I'm not a big fan of pork chops as I find them very dry, but these are absolutely delicious! By far the best pork chops I've ever had. I would recommend leaving them in the milk bath for 4 hours as they come out incredibly juicy.

These chops are AWESOME!!! I, too, was skeptical about a milk marinate, but my husband and I both thought these were some of the best chops we have ever had as they were so tender and moist! Used canned bread crumbs, and they stuck on just fine. In the future I will mix up 1/2 of the required bread crumb mixture, as I have 1/2 of the coating mixture frozen for the next time. Also deleted the applesauce as I had H/M apple chutney in the fridge. These chops can go it alone without any sauce. I used pork sirloin chops, and they needed to fry longer than the recipe states. I think that the thinner the chop the better, so that they don't burn on the outside while still being bloody on the inside. DO MAKE THESE CHOPS AS THEY ARE EXTREMELY GOOD!!!

This recipe is awesome! I followed the cook from Chicago's advice and dredged the chops in egg before crumbs. They turned out perfect and my entire family loved them. Will definitely make again.

The whole family loved it. Followed the recipe w/o a change. Fresh bread crumbs were nice and browned beautifully. The apple sauce was worth the effort. Wonderful fall meal.

Rating: 3
Comfort food is a great discription!! Chops that aren't too thick are important to the sucess of the "crust". If the chops need to sautee too long to cook though, bread crumbs will fall off. Also, the traditional 3 step breading process works well [ 1) dredge in seasoned flour, 2) dip in beaten egg, 3) dredge in seasoned bread crumbs].

Rating: 4
wonderful comfort food, and so much tastier than mom's version -- shake an' bake and motts. :)

I used packaged bread crumbs....perhaps that's why they didn't "stick" so well. I loved it and my teenage boys said they were the best chops they ever ate. I saved and froze leftover pork for chinese stir fry. The applesauce was unbelievably awsome!

This recipe is delicious. It is difficult now that pork is so lean to make a tender chop. But these chops are tender and very tasty without too much effort. A keeper!!!!

Really yummy! The applesauce was so much easier then I expected and just incredible. Did have a small problem-- my chops were too thick and I ended up ruining the crust in my attempt to cook them through. Next time I will have them cut them thin for me, it will be worth the hassle as this is so tasty.

This is a great recipe. I've never marinated meat in milk before, but the result was wonderful. The pork was flavorful and the applesauce was delicious (I substituted apple cider for the water, and used a little less sugar). This recipe was pretty fast too-- it only took me about 30 minutes to make.

Pork chops were delicious... really, it's the breadcrumbs that make this dish so yummy... I often make pork chops with breadcrumbs, and bake them... they never tasted as good as this! Pressed the breadcrumbs on with a fork. Used half the oil/butter recommended, and added as needed. Applesauce was quite tasty, if a bit too complex for the children.

Our whole family enjoy these. I didn't make the applesauce, but I did use some high quality, organic apple-blackberry sauce with them and it was great. I usually cut back on the fat a little bit from the receipe and I have made them crusted with cornmeal instead of bread crumbs, which is really good as well.

I followed the recipe except substituted sage because I had no rosemary. The meat was quite nice and tender, but I found the breadcrumb coating when cooked as directed turned out too heavy and greasy.

YUMMY!!!! I almost never eat fried foods, but this one was great!! I will definately make it again! Hint: When you mix up the flour mixture, cut the quantities by 1/2. It made way too much. I had to dump most of it out. And the thicker the pork chop the better, thats what i found anyway!! Yummy recipie!! Definatly try it!!

Total yum. The milk bath did the trick--the chops were meltingly good. I had never made chops with fresh crumbs (usually use cracker crumbs)--this way is much better. With garlic mashed and baked squash--Happy Autumn!

This was SO good! And how easy can you get? My husband called these the "best pork chops ever". Having never seen a milk bath for pork before I wasn't sure what to expect. The meat was butter tender and the crust was delicious. The applesauce was good. However, I'd say it's not really worth the expense or effort. Three cheers to Peter Brady and pork chopsh and appleshauce!
