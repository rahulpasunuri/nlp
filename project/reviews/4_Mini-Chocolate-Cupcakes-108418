Yummy and very chocolatey. They're not very sweet, so a nice chocolate buttercream frosting helps balance them out. Check them early to see if they're done--mine were fully baked after just 16 minutes.

These were SO good! Tripled the recipe to make 12 regular sized cupcakes. I tried making the Devil Dog icing recipe but it wasn't working out for me, so I gave up and just dusted them with icing sugar for now. They don't even need anything, they're that good! Very moist and tender, and you absolutely can't tell that you've completely subbed the oil out in place of dried fruit. That said, I think I'll do a never-fail cream cheese icing with them next. I can only see it adding to the amazingness of this cupcake. Wouldn't change a thing!

Yum! so good I think I could have put in less sugar! Also made cream cheese frosting for them. Doubled the recipe using two eggs and came out great.

These are delicious. Quadrupled the recipe to make 48 minis and baked for 18 mins. Came out perfectly: super moist and yummy - I used 70% chocolate. Topped them with the white chocolate frosting also found on this site & the quantities easily made enough to ice all 48 cupcakes. This is a keeper.

Awesome. Hubs has no idea there's fruit in them. 15 mins works in my oven - thanks reviewers.Also, good tips on icing, filling, serving different ways. Will make many times.

Delicious. Very moist. I tripled the recipe and it made 36 mini cupcakes. After I tasted one, I knew what I wanted to do with it - make them into mini whoopie pies. I split them and filled them with the traditional Maine version of a whoopie filling - I think there is a devil dog filling recipe on this site that would work. No need for powdered sugar on the top with the filling in the middle- plus they store nicely this way. Traditional Maine whoopie pie filling is a combo of crisco, marshmallow fluff and powdered sugar with vanilla.

made a huge error, i wanted to double the recipe..but instead of 4 tablespoon of flour i put in 4 CUPS!!so i shifted around with the recipe since i could find enough dates to quadruple the recipe with, i added dried figs into the boiled fruit mixture..the tiny fig seeds added amazing texture to the cupcakes..its like crystalyzed coarse sugar among very soft and fluffy cupcakes. NICE~ and added 2 cups of oil and 6 medium sized eggs instead.. Superp hit with everyone even my the picky eaters lil ones love them!

Tripled the recipe for 12 regular cupcakes, and also took the advice of the cook from Va. Beach to strain the batter through a sieve to remove pit pieces. These were delicious, rich and very intense. I topped them with vanilla whipped cream piped thru a pastry bag and they were a perfect dessert for Father's Day.

These were super simple and surprisingly good. You really can't tell there are dates in there and they really add moisture and work well with a 70% Cacao chocolate. I tripled the recipe and used mini muffin pans and I think I still only got 2 dozen. If you use a blender, soak the dates until really soft. These were a big hit! I used a simple white buttercream icing- butter, vanilla and powdered sugar.

These are really yummy! I love that most of the sugar comes from the dates, and the rest is brown sugar! Healthy! I tripled the recipe to make 12 normal cupcakes. I've made these many times and they always come out great! They're dense, moist, and have an intense, dark chocolatey flavor. I like to make the frosting from the epicurious recipe for devil dog cake to go with these cupcakes.

for a low fat cupcake these are outstanding, especially warm. I tripled the recipe, made them into 12 regular szed cupcakes and baked 20-25 min at 350 as another reviewer suggested. also, i substituted prunes for dates. they came out great.

I did not have choc chips so i added a dollop of butter& it tasted great.I baked mine for 15 min at 189 degreesC.

Very chocolate-y & slightly gooey little morsels that tasted pretty good. I doubled the recipe to make 20 mini muffins (in Flexipan tray) and used a few prunes since i ran out of dates. I stored them overnight and then sprinkled the sugar on top. But the sugar kept dissolving so they looked nothing like the photo. Still tasted pretty good and small bite size was satisfying.

These are terrific. I used raisins instead of dates because I already had them at home. I couldn't believe that these were so low in fat. Delicious!!!

A snap to make. I used Giardelli unsweetened cocoa, not dutch processed and Giardelli 60% Cocao bittersweet chocolate chips. I added the chips by sight, did not measure so probably way more than needed but oh so good. They are really worth making! Perfect size for your chocolate fix.

This is the best chocolate cupcake recipe I have ever tried, so dense and delicious. You will never know they are made with fruit. I haven't read all of the reviews so I don't know if this has been addressed already, but the ONLY issue with these is pitt pieces. I have made these several times and have come across a tiny piece of pit in the cake more than once. What I do is push the batter through a sieve into a large pitcher, then pour the batter into the cups from there. I find that you don't need to mess with chopping the dates first either b/c I put mine in the blended instead of a food processer along with the chocolate and it does the job. Then I use a hand mixer to mix the chocolate/date misture with the dry and add the eggs last. Chocolate cream cheese frosting made with ghirardelli milk chocolate chips, cream cheese, butter and powdered sugar is delicious, I get raves for it. If you multiply the recipe by 6, you can get exactly 2 dozen regular sized cupcakes, baking at 350 for 20-23 minutes.

Easy and totally yummy! They are good with and without frosting -- I made a really great cream cheese frosting, but they are so good on their own that it's not necessary.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic. No one noticed the dates and I kept mum that they were so healthy. I topped them with a little white chocolate and a rasberry (cute). I think frosting is the way to make them seem more rich and extravagant.

I increased the flour by a tad, left them in the fridge and ate them over a week. It kept its texture extremely well - dried fruit does amazing things. It wasn't death by chocolate, but it depends on your expectations I think.

Very good cupcakes & easy to assemble! They certainly don't taste low-fat. I had to double the recipe to get 12 regular sized cupcakes.

I thought these were really good. They were very dense, like a chocolate ganache almost. I made them in regular muffin pans and iced them with the dulce de leche/cream cheese/pecan frosting from this site. The icing was very rich, maybe richer than I'd have liked. A vanilla ice cream might have been better. My mother wasn't fond of the cakes, thought they were too dense, though I really think she didn't like them because she found out that they had dates in them. On another note, I made two batches. The first batch was made with only dates and callebaut semisweet chocolate buttons. The second batch I made with a mixture of raisins and dates (I ran out of dates) and used hershey's semisweet morsels. The hershey's batch was flufflier and not as dense. Either way, they're definently worth making because they're good for you but taste quite sinful.mmmm.

I've made these little gems many times and never does one go to waste! Everyone loves them even the skeptics. It's fun not to tell them what the ingredients are until after they tell you how good they are. Enjoy!!

My husband and I liked it however, we did not love it.. It IS moist, and maybe even too moist, but not a delicious moistness. It kind of tasted like some of fat free snackwell's cookies that we used to eat when we were living in california.. I think it would be great if you're in a strict diet and you crave some sugar & chocolate really bad or if you want to feed your kids something that is relatively healthy..

This is great! I used raisins instead of dates, like many other reviewers, because I had raisins and didn't have dates :) I ended up using about 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup water versus 1/3 of each. Because of the extra moisture, I baked mine for about 18 minutes. I also tapped to muffin tray on the kitchen counter halfway through baking, which gave it a very fudgy texture. I also didn't bother to chop the raisins up before boiling them, and they turned out beautifully. Delicious, and they don't make you feel guilty. I didn't put the sugar on them, and they certainly do not need it. A bit of low fat cream cheese frosting would be delicious though, but if you're keeping it healthy, skip it :)

I have made this recipe ten times in the week since I first make it, because my family can't stop eating them. I bake them for 15 minutes, or they get too dry, and I've used almond essence instead of vanilla, which was very well liked.

Very tasty; you'd never know these were low fat. However, triple or quadruple the recipe. One batch is suffice for one munchkin, but not for a group of adults.

I will defintely make these again. No one could believe they didn't have any butter or oil in them, they were so moist and yummy! (I chose this recipe when I needed a dairy-free dessert for a friend's birthday and doubled the recipe for my 24 muffin pan.) I used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate - I'd definitely recommend it!

Wow! This was fabulous. My husband kept asking, "and there's no butter?" "no oil?" I love chocolate and these really hit the spot. I used Sharfenbarger 70% bittersweet chocolate and Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa. Fabulous!

I agree with prior reviews that using good chocolate makes a difference. They're great for a somewhat guiltless chocolate fix.

Rating: 3
First, good chocolate is definitely important for this recipe. Also, I've tried this using dates and using raisins, and the version using dates works better. I've upped the sugar a bit when using very intense chocolate to balance it a bit. But, these make excellent little chocolate fixes! I've even tried them as mini-bundts, and that works well, too! I'm definitely trying the use of the date puree as a fat substitute in other recipes.

I made these for a second time using a good quality chocolate and discovered this was essential. The only reason I made them again was my husband was raving despite a semi-sweet baking chocolate. I thought they were only so-so. This time, I used a bittersweet 70% chocolate and it makes all the difference. Now I'm raving about them too!

These are amazing!! Deep, rich chocolate flavor and very moist. I lined the muffin pans with mini-muffin paper liners (available at cook shops). Also I used raisins instead of dates. Check them after 15 minutes. I made several batches of these and packed them in cookie tins as Christmas gifts. They were extremely popular and my friends loved that they were low-fat.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. My whole family was begging for more! It does not taste like a low-fat dish at all. I will definitely be making this again. Two modifications that I made that other cooks may find useful: 1. I used mini-muffin/cupcake paper liners in a standard muffin pan. 2. I used 1/8 cup of Ghiradelli double chocolate chips for the 1 ounce of bittersweet chocolate. [ I also cooked the cupcakes for 15 minutes as other reviewers suggested. ]

Found this when looking for a recipe to use some leftover dates & what a find. I made the first batch and then proceeded to make a double batch (the processor etc were ready dirty) for the freezer. Used mini muffin, heart and egg pans for variety and the were all great. Great for an upscale party requiring finger food.

Rating: 3
These were very good, and I too am a skeptic about low-fat recipes. I doubled the recipe and baked the second batch in mini-bundt pans. Then I put a bundt in the middle of a platter and the mini-cupcakes around the edges, each with one of my co-workers names. If I had more time, I'd have decorated the cupcakes like bumblebees and the bundt pan was the hive (our boss!)

Rating: 4
I make these just about every week and receive complements from everyone who tries them. They're very rich and very chocolatey. No one can beleive they're made with dates and are not at all unhealthy. As stated, it's preferable to use good quality chocolate. I've used both fine quality 70% and 30% cocoa chocolate and the 70% absolutely knocked me over. The cupcakes are still worth making even if you cannot get good quality high cocoa chocolate. Another addition might be to add a toasted, halved walnut or hazlenut to the top. They really don't need it though.

I was so very, very skeptical when I read this recipe; 'How on Earth could these be any good'? I WAS SO WRONG!!!! These are FABULOUS cupcakes (we call them 'muffins' so we can justify eating more)! Like some others, I substituted raisins, and baked for 15 min. These are so good, I may make a few more batches TODAY!!!

This was one of the best lowfat chocolate recipes I've tasted. I have used prune puree and applesauce before to cut out the oil/butter, but I think I like this date puree the best. Served with vanilla ice cream and dulce de leche (kind of cuts out the lowfat idea, but at least I could have chocolate in my dessert and not feel too guilty).
