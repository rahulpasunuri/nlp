This is my "go-to" caramel sauce. I've made it at least a dozen times and it's wonderful. I do add salt (1/8 tsp) which really makes the sauce extra special. I also love that this recipe doesn't have a ton of butter. Delicious.

tasted OK on ice cream but hardened too quickly and got too chewy

Took way less than 45 minutes to make-only 5-10 mins tops! Very easy and delicious. We put it on sundaes for movie night. Very yummy. This recipe is great because I always prefer to make these kinds of things from scratch rather than to use the bottled kind with their additives like partially hydrogenated oils, etc.
