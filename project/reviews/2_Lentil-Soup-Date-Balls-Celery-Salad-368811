I actually own the Mourad New Moroccan cookbook, and have made this recipe from that book. Reading the book gave me an appreciation for all the steps involved making this soup. In the book, Mourad talks about only using whole spices, toasting them, then grinding them to get the best flavor possible. I do agree that the soup is labor intensive, but I enjoyed making it, and my husband loved it. We liked the fact that it was not heavy (the proportion of lentils is not too high) and the dates were such a nice combination.

A ludicrous degree of complication. I kept wondering when the lentils were going to show up. Try a simple Turkish red lentil soup instead.
