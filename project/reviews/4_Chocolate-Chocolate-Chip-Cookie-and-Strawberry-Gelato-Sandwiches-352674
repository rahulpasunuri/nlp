Delicious! I used raspberry gelato and mint chocolate chip ice cream and they were snarfed up in a heartbeat. Great cookie all by itself ... nice with coffee or afternoon tea that way.

These cookies are outstanding, with or without the ice cream. I found the almond flavour delightful, but a little too subtle. Maybe a whole tsp. next time? If you do use them for ice cream sandwiches, don't skip the flatten-before-baking step, or the cookies will stay too soft. They are an excellent chocolate cookie base, too; such an easy recipe to add some flare: swap regular chocolate chips for mint chips, infuse with kahlua, sandwich between raspberry jam...possibilities are endless! Will definitely make again!

I used a frozen coffee yogurt, although you can obviously use whatever flavor/stlye filling you prefer. All in all I enjoyed the dessert but I think next time I'd bake the cookies as a pan bake, cut in half, spread the filling and replace the top, so that you could cut the sandwiches into nice, neat servings. I am a chocolate purist, but I have to admit that I loved what the almond extract did to the flavor of the cookie. Made it sophisticated.

These cookies are awesome. I have made the cookies just by themselves and people always want more.

These are yummy! I made some with the strawberry gelato and then some with store bought mint chocolate chip ice cream. I didn't bother bringing the butter to room temp or sifting the ingredients and the cookies were great. My husband suggested adding peanut butter chips to them next time!

Awesome cookie recipe. I was short on time so used store bought ice cream, but the cookies are sure to be in my regular rotation.

Very tasty, especially if you are a chocolate lover. The almond extract was a delicious twist that made these cookies stand out from your typical choco chips. Needed to cook the cookies about 6-7 min because they were too soft at 5 min.

These cookie/gelato sandwich cookies are wonderful. I made the two recipes as written; the cookies are delicious and the gelato is just fabulous, very flavorful and creamy. For time coordination, start the gelato first. They make a very fun dessert.

Excellent cookies. I made these cookies and gelato separate from each other. We just wanted to taste them as they are before making the sandwiches. The cookies were moist and really chocolatey. Yummy!

These sandwiches are SOOO delicious. The chocolate cookies are fabulous by themselves; the little bit of almond extract adds a delicious flavor to them. I didn't want to make the gelato, so I just used strawberry ice cream. I am not a big strawberry ice cream fan, but with the chocolate cookies it was delicious. My son had his with vanilla and loved it. They were easy to make and will be a staple dessert in our house come summertime. I will also be making these cookies instead of plain chocolate chip whenever the occasion arises. They're so much better. I used Ghirardelli 60% cacao choc. chips, which are larger than normal choc. chips, and they added a nice extra chocolate punch, especially when they were still warm and melty. YUM!
