What a great dinner! Yes, it's a little complicated but so worth the effort! I served it over pappardelle pasta. It was absolutely fabulous! Can't wait to make it again!

In Italy whe call this dish "Vitello in fricandò", and our recipe is a little bit different (the dish has french origins but has been commonly prepared in Lombardia ever since the Napoleonic ages), and has less ingredients. The traditional Italian recipe is here: http://www.academiabarilla.com/recipes/lombardia/veal-stew.aspx

Tasty, but hideously complex to make. Blanquette is French country food. I've made many, and it can usually be done in one pot. I found this one on the Epi app on my iPhone while in the supermarket looking for dinner ideas (for those with an iPhone, the Epi app may be the killer app for the phone), but did not realize how much prep time and how many dirty pans it was going to take until I had started doing it. Bad planning on my part, I know, but we ended up eating after 8 because of it. There are much simpler versions of this tasty dish.

This recipe is a favorite for special occaisions. I have to remind everyone that it is not polite to lick the bowl.

This is quite a different "stew" recipe given that the bulk of the ingredients are kept separate from what ultimately becomes the sauce. It's good, although a little veal- heavy, and might take well from some additional veggies such as potatoes or if you wanted to go a different direction, snap peas. The last dash of lemon is interesting. It definitely defines the sauce and I don't think the sauce would be right without it. But veal and lemon? It would be great on chicken, but on veal, I just don't know. If I wasn't concerned about its effects on texture, I'd think the better dominant taste would be red wine instead of the lemon.

Oh, please. Use another forum for your whining and quit skewing the review ratings percentages. I've rated this one four forks just to offset your message. I've also lodged a complaint with epicurious.com. (By the way, I'll bet you wear leather shoes.)

Very tasty dish. The veal was so tender it simply fell apart in your mouth. Everyone in my family enjoyed it too. It is not hard to make but a bit time consuming. I think next time I may add a few more vegetables.
