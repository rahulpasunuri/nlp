I used the common mango from the trees in my yard. The common mango does not have as good a flavor as the haden mango.I felt this recipe worked well with my common mango flavor but i changed the lemon juice to lime juice, sugar was perfect. The first time I made it with the 4 egg yolks it did not set enough to put it into a tart and have it hold its shape when cut. I made it a second time with 8 yolks and still the curd was not firm enough to put it in a tart shell and not have it run. For spreading on a cake as a thin layer for flavoring is good with this consistancy. I added some instant vanilla pupdding into the curd to get the consistancy I needed to make 2 inch tarts with a consistancy that would hold. I topped my tarts with meringue and torched the tops. It was a hit.

I made this exactly to the recipe and used one large fresh mango. Sieving was tedious but worth it. I agree that I had expected a more pronounced mango flavour so might reduce the amount of lemon juice next time. I just made it - still warm - so maybe will develop more mango flavour when it cools down.

I was SO looking forward to this recipe. Mango is my favorite flavor. The whole manfo /banana cake was printed in my local newspaper with rave reviews. Perhaps it was my altitute at 7000' or something else but it took well over 1 hour of constant whisking to get to 170 degrees. Also, the flavor, as others have suggested just wasn't mangoey. I have some left over and will use in vacherins with caramelized lemons on top but I will NEVER make this curd again!

I've made this many times over the last 7 years and it definitely requires tweaking. I add more mango puree than called for. I barely add any lemon juice. Also, it calls for way too much butter which interferes with the mango flavor. I put it 1 T. and it's much better. Overall, the recipe was a good spring board recipe.

Well this recipe was not bad but it did not have a mango flavor at all! It tasted like lemon curd...and I did not even add the full amount of lemon juice that the recipe called for. I don't necessarily know if it is the recipe or if it is just impossible to keep the mango flavor once you start cooking because before I cooked the puree, it tasted fine.

I made the banana cake on a hot humid day and the layers slid off. (I'll try the cake again--I now have air conditioning). Well, I needed a dessert, so I made the mango curd again and put in baked Pepperidge Farm puff pastry shells, and scattered a few fresh raspberries around. Awesome! Everyone raved!

This curd wasn't bad, just not really great. It wasn't as mango-y tasting as I would've liked, was a little bland, and a little too eggy tasting. If I were to make it again, I would increase the sugar to 3/4 cup, omit one of the egg yolks (and hope it still got thick enough), and add a little more lemon juice.
