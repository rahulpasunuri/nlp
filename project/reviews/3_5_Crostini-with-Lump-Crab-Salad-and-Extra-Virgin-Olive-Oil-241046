not worth making again - just plain

Excellent! Don't skimp on the ingredients. I used fresh herbs but bought a jarred bell pepper. Used pita chips. Everyone loved it. Expensive (if you used lump crab meat), but worth it! Enjoy.

Had this for a cocktail party & had to adjust at last minute because it didn't hold together on crostini for finger food. Next time I'd recommend making mayonnaise with olive oil & lemon juice. Tastes great & was big hit at party after these minor changes.

I made this as an appetizer for our Christmas dinner. I only had 1/2 lb. of fresh crabmeat so I divided the recipe in half. It still made about 10 toasts with what I consider a generous amount of crab mixture on each one. The recipe had excellent taste with nice layers of flavor. Definitely use fresh lemon juice/zest, it really brings all the flavors together. I chose not to drizzle the olive oil on top as I felt it already had a strong enough taste. Everyone loved it and I'd make it again for a special occasion.
