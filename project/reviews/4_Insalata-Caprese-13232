Great tour of a homegrown, organic, heirloom Caprese -- and the gardeners have a recipe for ricotta --- http://www.yourgardenshow.com/users/Your_Garden_Show/interesting-vegetables-i-have-known/slideshow/24637

With the availability of good tomatoes and fresh basil almost year-round these days, this dish is easy to make and takes you back to summer in the dead of winter. The tomatoes must be at peak, the mozzarella fresh, and the basil delicious. Use a very good olive oil. And sometimes, we use "reduced" balsamic vinegar which is sweet and sinful. To make that just empty a bottle of inexpensive balsamic vinegar into a saucepan and bring to a boil and "simmer" until the vinegar has reduced at least by half. Don't reduce too long or it will caramelize and become burnt-tasting. Just few drops here and there on the plate and it is (sort of) like the really expensive balsamic vinegars that are thick and luscious! Keep in a squeeze bottle in the fridge for "heaven" at your immediate request.

Call me crazy, I make and my friends love Insalata Caprese the old fashioned Caprese way. No vinegar to fight the tomato flavor. It's simple but that's the best part of Italian food.

This is a great go to recipe for ease. Add balsamic and definitely use the freshest of ingredients. I used the leftovers the next day in a hearty bread, grilled in a panini press...delicious!

Agree adding a bit of balsamic really makes the dish. Otherwise follow as written. A nice course before dinner.

The great debate balsamic vinegar or no balsamic vinegar. I experimented both ways and either way is great as long as you have quality ingredients. They key is very high quality ingredients.

Not even the best olive oil on its own can really make this salad. A nice sweet balsamic vinegar will make all the difference. Also...NEVER use bocconcini. I just ate the worst Caprese salad from a "fine foods" market and it inspired me to write this review. Bocconcini was used and guess what? No Balsamic. So this is your recipe for success: Good olive oil, balsamic vinegar that's a bit on the sweet side, and Buffalo mozzarella which is generally richer and more tender. I agree with everything else the recipe calls for.

This is a perfect Summer salad. We serve it as a side dish to bbq of tenderloin or skirt steak to balance the beef with lots fresh flavors. It would also go great with baked or grlled white fish. Adding a tablespoon of aged blasamic vinegar adds a kick, but children prefer it with just olive oil.

No olive oil; a couple of drops of balsamic vinegar; the freshest of local tomatoes and basil; mozzarella buffalo from Whole Foods - absolutely wonderful.

Excellent salad! Be sure to use the best possible garden or farmers' market tomatoes. Also, buy top quality fresh mozzarella. I buy mine at Whole Foods (their brand) and it is great. Use top-quality olive oil, too. Julienne the basil and sprinkle it on top along with salt and pepper. This is a hearty, one dish meal. Just de- lish!

I totally disagree that the addition of vinegar would destroy the delicate flavor of the cheese. I have always drizzled my caprese salad with a bit of balsamic vinegar and I just recently returned from Italy where I was served (GASP!) vinegar drizzled caprese salad!

This is a no brainer. These ingredients combine naturally into one great punch of flavor. I alway use fresh basil and tomatos from my organic garden and the best mozzarella available. Even if the mozz is not perfect, the combination of ingredients will send your taste buds soaring. This is a staple at almost every evening meal in my home during the tomato months. This works very well with roasted red peppers when tomatos are not at their prime. And yes, sometimes I do a light drizzle of balsamic. We love this!

Excellent and authentic. I also added thin small slices of spicy roasted red peppers.

This is the basic, but classic recipe for this Italian salad available and consistent throughout Italy when it is made with basil, skip the Arugula or else you are just making another salad. Good basil can and will be the star of this dish along with good quality oil and cheese. DON'T use the cheap, dry balls of mass produced chesse in the deli section of your local market. Make sure the cheese is basically floating in water. Also, to be truly authentic, use buffalo milk cheese as they do in Italy, its a bit softer and tastier than the standard fare. Serve with some crusty bread, pinot grigio and and some Italian music and you will be in heaven.

So authentic, so classic, so simple and soooo good! Nothing beats Caprese Salad for a light lunch... I serve it with garlic bread (brush on whatever bread leftovers with a mixture of olive oil, crushed pepper, lots of pureed garlic, paprika, oregano and salt, toast in oven). Enjoy!

As someone said, this tastes like summer. I find good quality/good price EV Olive Oil at Trader Joe's, and I will try the BV reduction method. I have homegrown basil and oregano, and this dish sings. Along with a chilled glass of a nice Pinot Grigio, you have a wonderful light summer meal.

I have always loved caprese salad. It was a running joke in my family when we visited Italy that I would always order the Caprese salad, without fail. I made this salad with buffalo mozzarella (I know, not authentic, but I'm Napoletana). I've also never made it with pepper... I like it with just a generous amount of salt, really good oil, and vine ripened tomatoes. And a LOT of basil. SO good if you keep it simple.

I've tried for years to replicate a Caprese recipe from a Chicago hotel with no success. The secret? Leave out the vinegar! Absolutely fabulous -- especially with southern Illinois tomatoes! I must confess -- I pigged out!

Simple, and perfect for summer evenings. Do not add to or change this in any way, it has been around for such a long time, wonderful as is, and too over complicate it would be a waste!!! (Especially no vinegar, no matter no tempting!!!)

Delicious!!! Over time we've made a few adjustments to this salad and it is consistently the crowd favorite! Sliced roasted red/yellow/orange peppers (marinated in olive oil) accompany our sweet tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. We mince garlic and sprinkle on top before we drizzle the platter with Extra Vir. Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar. (For this salad we use our garlic infused EVOO and a whisked BV.) Liberally crack sea salt & black pepper on top. Serve with a crusty bread...grilled if you have the time! ENJOY!!!

Simply sublime! Have made this many times and it is one of the very best summertime taste treats. Recently had a beautiful array of vine-ripened heirloom tomatoes of various sizes/shapes in a colour palette ranging from purple and red to yellow and green to rose and peach. The resulting "jewel box" effect was visually stunning and the flavours were truly outstanding. Like others, I do prefer a splash of balsamic and agree that only the best/freshest ingredients will do this salad the justice it deserves. A treat for all your senses, including hearing, as you are sure to blush with all the compliments that come your way!

Excellent salad. I enjoyed it in Italy, and I've been enjoying it here ever since. To make for a group, or to make when I'm craving it out of season, I often buy a 2 cartons of cherry tomatoes. I halve them, cube the mozzerella, slice the basil, and mix with 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, sea salt and fresh ground pepper. I put it all in a big bowl and let it marinade for a couple hours before serving. It is not as good as the real recipe, but I'm usually the only one who knows it. People rave about it.

This recipe is my favorite classic. I agree that a splash of very good balsamic vinegar is a nice touch. Arugula adds a nice peppery flavor. Best eaten in the late summer/fall with all the yummy heirlooms.

This is my all time favorite salad, which also can be considered an appetizer. Without a doubt a good balsamic vinegar drizzled on this dish, in addition to the olive oil really enhances it. Primo!

Outstanding recipe... we just returned from Italy, and Insalata Caprese was on our menu every night. It varied depending on the quality of the cheese, but the open air dining, the smell of fresh basil, the crunch of the sea salt, oh, to be there again!

Great as is. To the onion lovers out there. Mince a small piece of onion and sprinkle over the tomato slices let sit for an hour to allow the onion juice to infuse with the olive oil/tomato. Slightly chilled and you're good to go.

Agree with KC/Londoner and Napierville reviews about adding a splash of balsamic vinegar. It does jazz things up. Just wishing I had some right now.

I am a huge fan of Insalata Caprese, and have the wonderful fortune of heritage tomatoes of several types, plus several types of basil in my garden this year, planted specifically for this salad! Note to Montclair - not much can truely "ruin" this salad if you have good tomatoes from the garden or farmers market, and good fresh basil. (I always use triple the basil) Even the mozzarella can be less than perfect. Your olive oil will be just fine as long as you like the taste of it. Do you use it for dipping bread? If so, it will be fine here.

I haven't made this yet, however I have read almost all of the reviews and the most frequently repeated phrase is that you must use 'quality ingredients'. Does anyone have a recommendation for a quality olive oil that I can get in a supermarket? I'm having second thoughts about making it with the oil I already own for fear I will ruin it if it's not a certain quality.

I always add a little balsamic vinegar--not authenic, but no one complains!

Wonderful and stunningly beautiful! I couldn't find fresh mozzarella in my market (although it's usually not a problem to do so), so I used fresh goat cheese instead. I skipped the addition of dried oregano, since I wanted to use some fresh oregano from my herb garden. I served this salad as an appetizer with grilled polenta toasts. Very popular -- and all gone before dinner!

Great recipe. Tastes like Summer. Want to impress the socks off all your friends who have had this before? Want to make them think you spent $100 on the best Balsamic? Put 2 cups of reasonably good BV in a heavy sauce pan (Costco own brand is perfect), add one tablespoon of plain old white sugar and simmer VERY SLOWLY until reduced by about half. While cooking you should just see whisps of steam coiming off the top. Stir fairly frequently. Cool well, and drizzle your rich, syrupy, brand new "50 year old" Balsamic over the Caprese salad. You'll never go back.

I've been making this recipe for years, and it's so imperative to use only the best ingredients. I just brought a bottle of olive oil home from Italy, which is cold-pressed, very pure, and has so much more flavor than some of the cheaper supermarket oils. Spend a few bucks on your olive oil - it makes a difference!

Try this!! Assemble the tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. Saute an entire head of minced garlic on medium-low heat in extra-virgin olive oil. Do not brown the garlic! Just before it starts to brown, drizzle garlic and oil over the 3 assembled ingredients. It will release the perfume from the basil and really bring out the delicate flavor of the cheese. Sprinkle with salt and DEVOUR.

This is scrumptious. For a bit more oomph I add anchovies on top of each slice of mozzarella; and top with capers and chives.

Rating: 4
I made this because of the reviews and the introduction. I stacked the tomatoes up with the mozzarella in between and then put the arugula on top (like a tower). I had little yellow and orange pear shaped tomatoes that I sprinkled around the edge and it looked great, then when I realized the only flavor here is salt, pepper, oregano and olive oil I got nervous. Don't worry this is the BEST caprese I've ever had. I must have been messing with this recipe for 15 years and this is so simple, but it is great. I followed the reviews and used only the best ingredients (really ripe flavorful tomato & real buffalo mozzarella).

This has been a family favorite for years. A lot of the dishes the poor people eat in Italy are favorites and very expensive here in America. When I think of summer, I think of Insalata Caprese.

Caprese, in any variation, is one of my favorite dishes. Especially now you can use fresh garden grown tomatoes in the recipe. Absolutely delicious!!!

I know it also is not correct, BUT adding a little minced fresh garlic and grated pepper to the olive oil/balsamic vinegar mixture gives an interesting flavor. So my taste buds are not purists- sue me!

I serve this with bread for a light lunch. I know its not correct, but this does taste more interesting with a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar.
