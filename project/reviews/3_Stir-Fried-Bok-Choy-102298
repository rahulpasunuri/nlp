Very good, very easy. Took others' suggestion and stir-fried chopped stalks first, then added greens.

I may change my rating if I make this again, but take the advice of the recipe: DON'T USE ORDINARY GROCERY STORE BOK CHOY. It's really too tough. I'll know better next time.

Easy and delicious! Will definitely make again.

This is a really perfect Chinese recipe. I've made it several times by now and everybody loved it. Last time I added a tbs of fermented black beans for extra flavour. I stir-fry the bok choy in two steps: first the stalks as they need more time, then the leaves. Mayby I will add some chopped celery stalks next time.

Pretty easy, and a nice change. I have a hard time finding vegetables my husband will eat, and he enjoyed these.

This sauce gave a lovely, subtle flavor to a favorite vegetable. As other cooks have noted I would certainly try it with different vegetables.

Excellent. We'll have this again and again.

Easy, interesting and flavorful. I added cubed Japanese eggplant and spinach to the stir-fry. The result was great. Be careful not to overcook the leaves as they shrink up like spinach. I

I made this last night w/ a few modifications... I added steamed chicken breast and tripled the sauce (except the Cornstarch)... This was a good meal... although maybe I'm just a hog, but I don't think would serve 4-6 (I guess it was only intended as a side dish). I was able to get some baby bok choy, and so it was very tender. I would definitely make this again. The only thing I might change is perhaps try to get a little extra kick (I like some spice). I did add an extra clove of garlic as well.

Made this recipe many times. Have also used the sauce with other stir-fry dishes. I like to add a tablespoon of shaoxing wine to it as well.

When making with full-size bok choy, separate the white stems from the leaves. Cook the stems for 3-4 minutes, then add the greens for another minute or two. Very tasty way to have fresh greens.

So good that I made it twice in a week. You don't necessarily have to use baby bok choy (less than 8 inches). Really fast and easy.

Yum! A fast easy recipe.. I added some marinated tofu into mine, and left out the sugar and most of the cornstarch (it was plenty thick) and it turned out great!

This was my first attempt at cooking anything elaborate... It was very good and easy to make :)

I made this last night with some very fresh young bok choy (green variety), and I thought it was lovely. Very easy, the flavors of the sauce didn't take anything away from the subtlety of the bok choy. Only one thing, I found that the sauce instantly got too thick and I had to add water twice. No big deal though. I will definitely make it again.
