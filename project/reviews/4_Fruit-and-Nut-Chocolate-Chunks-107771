These were great and versatile, as others have said. I used almonds, candied ginger, apricots and dried cherries. It's impressive and a good way to use up bits of things that are in the pantry.

This is a great recipe because it's extremely versatile - you can pretty much sub any kind of fruit and nuts you like and you'll always have a different treat. Looks like it takes great effort too, but it's super easy. I subbed crystallized ginger and cherries for the dried fruit since it's what I had in the pantry. Really good when fresh - people will be so impressed. I still have some kicking around from a couple weeks ago and while it still tastes perfectly good, it is a bit gray so either freeze or eat within a few days.

Easy enough to be worth it -- but I'd lose the fruit and stick with just nuts. Fruit gives it a mushy texture (and texture is almost as important as flavor to me). Definitely use salted nuts -- mine were low salt and unsalted, and I'm missing the salty goodness.

These were so easy and so delicious. I'd add more nuts and fruit next time. Make sure to use salted nuts. Kept well for almost a week before turning grey. Huge hit, loved them!

Great, easy recipe that is now a holiday staple for us. I would agree that is it all in the quality of the chocolate.

Used roasted pistachios and almonds for the nuts and dried cherries and raisins for the fruit. Fantastic! Also used 9x11 pan so it's more like chocolate bark.

We love this treat and have been making it since it first appeared. Lindt 70% gives just the right bittersweet taste. Can't seem to cut perfect squares, but no one ever complains. Making bark as others have suggested sounds like a great idea.

This is a huge hit and much requested. For a change I made it in 13 x 9 pan so it was more like bark - Most everyone prefers it this way. I always substitue Cherry Craisins for the cherries.

This recipe is a keeper. Definitely use a good chocolate such as Ghiradelli.

Easy and delicious. I used cooking spray too, but next time will try another reviewer's suggestion of reynolds quick release foil. I followed the recipe, but I think you can substitute any fruit and nuts you like and still have this come out great. I think to make cutting easier, I would chop the fruit and nuts next time. I tried to make smaller squares but they crumbled.

This is a great, quick recipe. Use the best chocolate available. I also used Pam; it was much easier. It is really fun to experiment with the recipe - I usually use Craisins instead of raisins and whatever salted nuts are available.

I made this for Passover, but no one was interested in eating it. It was OK, but I thought nothing special.

This wa SO easy to make! I made it for a brunch .Had other desserts also, but this was a big hit. I used Ghiardelli chocolate chips, milk-chocolate. Only used pecans since I didn't have any pistachios on hand. I sprayed Butter-flavored Pam on the foil and had no problem peeling it off the chocolate. I broke up the pieces instead of cutting and arranged it on a small plate. Superb!

The easiest, best thing I have ever made! I used a fruit & nut trail mix instead. I may try it next time with white chocolate & dark chocolate!

Very easy to make. I am going to try it with semi-sweet chocolate next time. I'm not a big fan of bittersweet chocolate (Dark either) but friends that are just loved it.

Use Reynolds Quick Release foil instead of greasing the foil--candy peels right off.

This won raves from my coworkers. Make sure that you use the best possible bittersweet chocolate, as it really makes a difference. I added a couple tablespoons of kirsch and substituted dried cherries for the cranberries. Delicious!

These are superb, and so very easy. Once cut, and placed on a beatiful dish, you have an elegant dessert. I plan to keep the ingredients on hand, since it is so quick and simple to make.

This was one of the simplest chocolate/dessert recipes I've ever made. It went over very well at a Superbowl party. I didn't oil the foil and everything came out just fine.
