Love this recipe. I too found them difficult to smash UNTIL...I microwaved the potatoes...4-5 minutes (stopping to turn over halfway through) for 3-4 potatoes. After that, wrap them in a paper towel, place on counter, and gently flatten to 1.5 - 2 inches thick with the bottom of my mortor (or meat mallet). I think the microwave makes the centers more soft and therefore smashes more evenly from the inside out. I also peel a bit of the skin off the bottoms and tops before nuking...as I think the skin does not brown as pretty as the potato itself. YUM!!! SOOOO SIMPLE!

I thought this recipe was so simple and delicious! I used the small Yukon golds - boiled 15 min, let cool a bit then mashed down with any flat surfaced item. Put in fridge as another reviewer had suggested , on cookie sheet. Drizzled with EOO and sprinkled with kosher salt. In oven 450 for 20-30 min and then sprinkled with Parm cheese. Everyone loved them and wanted more.

These turned out very good- I would agree on fully cooking the potatoes, though. They were hard to smash, so I halved the potatoes and then panfried them. But, they came out very good! I served them with a crustless quiche.

I honestly changed quite a bit of this recipe, but in case this helps other cooks... I would have boiled the potatoes til they were done, they were a little undercooked & when smashed didn't hold together. I wanted more flavor, so I diced some bacon & fried it up. Added a touch of olive oil to the bacon fat, then added the potatoes & pepper. Cooked as instructed - 20 min, turning once. Potatoes were fine, not really crispy (more olive oil would have been good!), not very tasty - until I added gravy. Will definitely try again, but will follow the recipe closer next time, I think.

Easy and wonderful. Used mix of small-ish yukons, red, and purple. When tender, drain and return them to the empty pot to dry out for a few minutes and cool slightly. For smashing, while still warm, place on a cutting board that will fit in the fridge and use anything - the bottom of a small bowl, a pyrex measuring cup - whatever - to gently push down until the spud compresses and splits a bit. Don't over-compress! Now here's the trick: yes, there may be a bit of crumbling, but not to worry, gently push the crumbling parts back together and leave on the cutting board, then do the next one. You'll end up with the potatoes laid out on the board like cookies on a sheet. Put the whole thing in the fridge to chill for an hour or two. This will help the potatoes crust up and hold together a bit better. Now when you get your oil plenty hot, just gently scoop them up and into the oil. As they brown they will firm up and hold together. These really do have a wonderful mouth feel with the satisfaction of both a crispy fried potato AND a fluffy inner world. Don't be intimidated - MAKE THEM AND BE HAPPY!

I smashed them with a class coated with cooking spray, sprayed more olive oil on them and then cooked them in a pretty hot oven, 400 degrees I think, to crisp them up. I added salt after spraying with oil, and again after they came out, but we like them pretty salty. Served as a side with the spinach strata from this site and they were a big hit with my husband and guests. Baking them really made it easy to serve to guests rather than having to stand at the stove frying anything. Oh and I didn't use the parm. cheese, just kosher salt.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a bit hit. I've found that purple potatoes and fingerlings usually work best for me. They seem to hold their shape better when I smash them. I don't have a potato masher and have used a meat tenderizer in the past. I've found that a 1/2 cup of the cheese is too much for me. I like to add some fresh rosemary just as the potatoes and fishing frying. The fresh herbs add a lot of flavor.

This recipe is phenomenal and a guaranteed crowd pleaser... after a few minor adjustments. Put a small slice on all four sides of each potatoes. Boil for about 20 minutes, then pull out of the water, put in a glass bowl with a small amount of water in the bottom and microwave for 3 minutes. Then smash the potatoes in the pan with the oil (wear pot-mitts!).

This was a disappointment. It sounded easy enough but the "smash" part of this recipe made my potatoes crumble. I did try to salvage this dish by frying what I had in the pan but they turned out hard and tasted under cooked. Not sure if I will make this again.

I peeled a Yukon, cut into 2" pieces, boiled for 10 minutes, drained, then tossed into the hot pan and used my ricer to mash while frying. Simple. Delicious with eggs and salsa.

I was concerned about the difficulty mentioned in various reviews regarding handling and crushing the boiled potatoes. So I took some advice from a reviewer regarding a similar recipe and modified this one. After boiling the potatoes, draining and letting them cool, I placed a sheet of parchment paper on a baking pan. I put little blobs of evo on the parchment paper,sprinkled kosher salt and pepper on each blob then laid a potato on each. I flattened each potato with a large, flat turner and cooked them in the oven at 500 degrees until they look a little browned and crispy, about 15 to 20 minutes. they came out crispy, on both sides without having to turn them and creamy inside. They were a fun chanage from roasted, or mashed, red potatoes.

I experienced the same difficulties that many other reviewers did. What a mess and really didn't come out great at all.

Because of other reviewers' complaints about crumbling potatoes, chilled them overnight before smashing, and they stayed in one piece after I smashed them with a meat tenderizing mallet. Added cayenne, lots of pepper, and herbes de provence, but still thought this was a little unthrilling. Will add garlic next time, and that will do the trick.

Very good. I boiled and smashed - with a glass - then let cool and fried them several hours later. Fast and easy, a nice twist to potatoes.

Looks easy enough,but the"smashing" did not work out as suggested. My husband and I laughed at how ridiculous this was. Will not be making this again.

Used potatoes fresh from the garden and these were amazing! What a wonderful and easy tapas.

Tasty - I've made these potatoes a few times because they're pretty simple. Each time I've opted out of the parmesan cheese because I don't mind the flavor of the potatoes on their own, though to be fair I did add a few bits of onion and garlic. Like other reviewers I've used both Yukon Golds and Baby Reds but find that the Yukons always come out super delicious. Because I don't have a potato masher I just used a drinking glass and that did the trick just fine.

I agree with others--there are easier ways to get the same, if not better, effect.

These are so yummy! I didn't fry as much as sautee in just a little oil, and they were still delicous! The only thing I would mention is that you need to be careful smashing them, or they fall apart, making them hard to fry later (but still good!)

I have made a similar recipe using Yukon Gold potatoes and prefer those to the Red potatoes. But still pretty tasty.

This is a simple, delicious side dish and low-fat to boot as long as you only put a tiny bit of cheese in it. :)

Used yukon gold - came out very well. Used lots of salt and skipped the parmesan as it might mask great potato flavor.

This was so easy and good. I used baby yukon golds instead of red potatoes just because I like the texture better. They turned out just as photographed here. Soft and creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Topped with freshly grated imported Italian parmesan - delicious!

these things weren't so great. for one thing, the potatoes don't crush very well; when i tried to crush them, they fell apart. they are also very bland. i reccomend lots of salt and pepper (and maybe some herbes de provence).

This one's a keeper! They fell apart when I used the potato masher to squash them, though-- midway I switched to a metal spatula and that did the trick.

Good! I accidentally bought potatoes that were too big and it was still good. We'll definitely make this again, but with the right size potatoes.

It just doesn't get any better than this! Crispy, salty, and comforting, not to mention easy, this recipe will be a classic in my kitchen from now on. Instead of using 1/2 cup olive oil, I mixed 1/4 cup olive oil with 1/4 cup canola oil to increase the smoking point and get an ultra crunchy and golden brown exterior. Simply delicious!
