All i can say about this receipt is blah. I used fresh eggplant, peppers and herbs from my garden and added some ricotta cheese and pine nuts to the goat cheese. The roasted pepper sauce needed some zip. My eggplants were too small to roll so I stacked them. It looked beautiful but was unbelievably bland. I thought it was okay, but my husband didn't like at all. It's something I might make again with some spicy peppers and more seasoning for my vegetarian sister, but definitely not one of my favorites.

This was a lovely dish but I love anything with goat cheese. I made it to the recipe with the exception of adding pine nuts to the cheese. It wasn't very filling and would use as an appetizer for a dinner party but not a main course without doubling the recipe or adding something else to it.

This recipe is fun! I'm working in the field and could only get my hands on one eggplant. So, I rolled up the remaining filling in pieces of roasted red pepper, and used a tomato based sauce. Adding pine nuts to the filling was delicious as well.

Delicious. We roasted our own red peppers and used lemon juice because we didn't have oranges. Our eggplant were small, so we stacked it rather than rolled in in the pan..like a lasagna. Even better the next day!

So Yummy! This recipe gets added to my list of favorite dishes. Based on other reviews I made a few modifications: replaced parsley with basil, added pine nuts to the filling, and tomato sauce to the bell pepper sauce. I loved everything about this dish, the eggplants, the filling, the sauce and the overall presenation was beautiful as well.

So yummy! Used fresh small red peppers instead of roasted (didn't have any) and added some canned tomatoes, as others have suggested. Used feta, instead of goat (didn't have any) and it was so delicious. I don't really care for capers that much, so next time plan to leave them out, since you can really taste them. Forgot the orange, and it was still really good - but will try it with orange next time.

I really enjoyed this dish but i added ricotta to the goat and i have to admit that was just perfect. I cheated and had a spicy tomato sauce instead of the peppers sauce. Delish!

Delicious--good enough to make again for sure, especially because it's healthy! Jar peppers worked just fine for this sauce, and were a lot quicker and easier.

I didn't have roasted red peppers and used fresh ones instead. The sauce was surprising with the addition of the orange juice. A really delicious vegetarian meal.

I changed everything about this recipe, but it's a great idea for low-carb "pasta". I used a store-bought pasta sauce, and substited the goat-cheese with a ricotta and parmesan mixture with spinach and basil. It was excellent and much easier.

didn't care for the fact the sauce was too sweet and the cheese mixture was too sour. I like cheese, goat cheese and all. But it's just... wrong... in this context. love the eggplant part of the rolls but the whole thing needs work. I will try other reviewer's suggestions for ricotta replacement next time

Wonderful! I did slice the eggplant thin, and as a result the "cannelloni" was delicate yet rich tasting. I was in a rush so I cheated and rushed a jarred tomato/red pepper sauce, and I added ricotta to the goat cheese as several had mentioned. My husband raved. :)

Excellent dish. I make this on a regular basis for guests. Very easy to prepare and a makes a great impression.

I made the sauce exactly as directed, but changed the goat cheese to a feta/ricotta mix (I hate goats). I thought it was great. I mean, a main course this filling for 250 calories? The olives and capers meant the filling had lots of flavor and I thought the red pepper sauce was a lovely compliment. If you want tomato sauce, just use it. I think some of the complaints about the sauce are from people who expected the red peppers to taste like tomatos. Surprise! They don't! I ate this with 1 serving of cooked barley and came away from the table FULL!

This is so tasty and healthy, it has become one of my staples. But I do alter the recipe. I chop sundried tomatoes and basil and mix that with the goat cheese instead. I then garnish everything with basil, rather than parsley. I've served it for guests, and it gets great reviews each time.

Great for eggplant lovers. I didn't like them as much as I wanted to. I think I cut the eggplant too think and the sauce needed more seasoning.

This is delicious, added extra olives to the filling and topped with parm.

This was easier than I thought, and tasty. I cooked the sauce down quite a bit as I like it that way, but everything just worked together very well.

I thought it was tasty, but my husband went and made himself a sandwich instead. That has never happened before. The flavor combination was just unappealing to him.

This is great. I made the recipe as written except for ladling some of the sauce on top, and I was a little heavy handed with the Kalamato olives. It serves eight as an appetizer and four as a main course.

My husband loved this. I added some pinenuts to the peppers before placing in the blender, it added a nice nuttiness to the sauce.

I made the sauce as per the recipe and LOVED it. I think next time I'd use the filling in pasta shells, or add to the filling as others have, as I found the eggplant overpowered the filling.

My family and I LOVED this meal!! I added ricotta, parmesan and feta cheese and 1 can diced tomatoes to the filling. I used more olives than the recipe calls for, about 10. I brushed eggplant with olive oil rather than using spray. I ladled sauce over top and added parmesan cheese flakes, then broiled for 2 minutes for finishing touch. So Yummy!!

i thought i would love this recipe but i really didn't. make sure you pick good eggplants and that you like the flavor of kalamata olives and everything in the cheese (which sounds obvious but for some reason i thought everything together would give it a different taste). the sauces was AMAZING and i'm going to save the recipe for homemade spaghetti sauce (i added 3/4 can of tomato paste, so for the pasta sauce i'd probably add the whole thing)

I cut the eggplant at 1/4 and sprinkle with salt and left for 10 minutes,when water of eggplant begin to run out then with a little of olive oil in a pan until light brwon. Tomato on the sauce too.

Loved this recipe. Couple things I did differently based off of the reviews was cut the goat cheese with a little ricotta cheese and added tomato sauce to the red pepper sauce. I added pine nuts to the cheese filling and it was soooo good! Only thing I would do differently is I cut the eggplant in 1/4" slices but the recipe called for 1/2". I should have followed the recipe there because the cheese filling was a little much after while. All and all I great dish!!

To be honest, I was on a time crunch so I had Paul Newman help me out in the sauce department, but this recipe turned out incredible! It was a lot easier than I expected as well, and I mixed a little ricotta with the goat cheese for some variation in texture. Definitely a great meal to cook when you're impressing someone :)

Good recipe! I especially enjoyed the tanginess of the sauce (although I added one tomato to the peppers, so it could be because of that as well). Had no parsley, so used fresh basil instead. Would have wanted to have the eggplant a little softer, but maybe that's due to my oven (electric) and I just needed to cook for a bit longer. Very yummy indeed!

I loved it, and so did my husband. Will definitely make again! I thought it was great as it was, no changes were made.

I too found the goat cheese a little rich and overpowering. I would definitely cut with ricotta next time or use a ricotta cannelloni filling. I did enjoy the eggplant as a pasta alternative. I used Olivieri's spicy red pepper tomato sauce and it was perfect.

Rating: 3
Overall a good dish, with a few changes: cut the goat cheese with some ricotta -less dense that way. Nixed the red pepper sauce and used my own homemade, spicy tom sauce..the kick was nice. I also added chopped spinach to the cheese mixture -like a pesto texture. Husband wanted a protein, mabe add ground meat to the sausce?? Overall a good vegetarian dish, would make for a pot luck.

Very good - husband wanted more protein (maybe add a meat sauce?). But the goat cheese was a nice variation from norm. Used own sause also -a little spicy version. would make again - keeps well

I thought this dish was great. I thawed some frozend homemade sauce and spread on top before cooking in the oven. Will serve with pasta on the side next time.

I didn't read the reviews before making and wish I had. Following the recipe...the red pepper sc was bitter and the goat cheese was just too overpowering. I like the ideas i nthe reviews and would try it again.

Rating: 3
I took the advice of others and used 15oz of tomato sauce along with the red peppers! This was delicious. Next time I think I will try some red pepper flakes in the sauce. I think a little spiciness would have put this over the top. But, even without it, it was delicious.

Rating: 2
The red pepper sauce was amazing. I added red chili flakes and used lemon instead of orange to cut the sweetness and bitterness and it was spicy and sweet and delicious. I also really loved the filling (used ricotta which is cheaper than goat cheese and on hand), though I had trouble getting my eggplant to not be rubbery.

My roommate has high cholesterol, so we substituted soft tofu for about 3 ounces of the goat cheese and it turned out wonderfully! There was still a subtle goat cheese taste and the texture was great. We also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of one of the jars of roasted red peppers and were glad that we did.

Rating: 4
Great recipe; four forks. I used 12 oz of roasted red peppers and 12 oz of tomatoes with excellent results. My wife normally does not like goat cheese, however this dish was the exception.

Rating: 2
The eggplant portion of the recipe is delicious. However, there is a disconnect between the eggplant rolls and the sauce. The sauce is too sweet. If I try the recipe again, I will cut the roasted red peppers in the sauce and add tomatoes instead to reduce the sweetness. Served with pasta.

Rating: 3
A delicious and fun dish. Very easy to make and very difficult to screw up! The next time I make it I will add something to the sauce--not sure what yet--as it was too sweet to me. I wanted something a bit more robust. But all in all, super delicious, easy, and fun to eat.

Great recipe! Made it as written. My family could not get enough of it.

I made this last night for me and my husband and we both enjoyed it. I cut the recipe in half and found that I still had A LOT of the red pepper sauce. If I were to make it again I would cut the amount of peppers in half (i.e. if you make the full serving I would only use one jar of peppers as it goes a long way) or you can serve it over pasta or with bread to absorb the sauce.
