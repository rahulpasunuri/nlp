This is a nice change to the traditional American chop suey. It's easy to make and my son loved it. I used the Jiffy cornbread mix and was fine.

Perfect football food. Filling and tasty. I simplified it by doing it all in one pan. I cook the onion, garlic, and meat in a cast iron skillet and then bake it in the same skillet. A great recipe to play around with as far as seasoning. Will definitely make this again. Very quick and easy to put together.

Existing recipe was pretty good, nothing to write home about. But I LOVE the concept. 3 forks for the original recipe, not 4 because it doesn't reach its potential. I'm glad I tasted it in the skillet to make some adjustments to make this dish livelier. The existing spices seemed to be pointing towards a jerk flavor, so I added clove (under 1/4t), cardamom(1/4t), and amped up the allspice (another 1/4t). The spice additions took the beef flavor to the next level, like the filling of a quality jamaican beef patty. For the cornbread, I added 2T sugar to balance out my added spices and I cut in a spoonful of bacon grease--I like both my cornbread and my cobblers to be crumbly--before adding the wet ingredients. The results were excellent -- 4 forks for sure. I would definitely recommend my adjustments. Wife and house guest were impressed.

My finance and I made this recipe tonight. We omitted the ginger because we were out of it. We used Chili powder instead of the cayanne due to a few family members not liking spicy foods. And we choose to use Jiffy brand cornbread mix (one box) instead of the recipe provided. We prefer this brand over homemade. Overall we liked it and will make it again.

I also use skim milk instead of whole for the corn bread topping, and it comes out great!

I have made this with ground turkey as well as beef, and the turkey version is also delicious. This is one of my and my husband's favorite easy weeknight recipes.

Delicious, simple, cheap and reheats very well. I didn't add the sugar to the beef. The spiciness was just right, and the cornbread rose and baked perfectly, even though I didn't drop it in individual cobbler-like dollops, but spread it out over the beef, like a pot pie. Very good!

Made this for my kids who usually complain about what I'm cooking. I received a rare, "Dinner was good, Mom." The unsweetened cornbread sets off the flavor of the meat well - I did add a bit more sharp cheddar cheese and I used fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic.

Rating: 2
This is OK, but I thought that the meat mixture was overly sweet and the biscuits could have used the sweetness (you might switch the sugar). I was also hoping for more heat. I added one chopped seeded jalapeno along with the onions in addition to the cayenne, but alas not spicy enough for my palate. The biscuits weren't great either. Maybe I should have put the jalapeno in the biscuits? Also I used grated Parmesan as I had no cheddar so can't really say if they would have been better had I followed the recipe exactly. For this reason I give it two stars instead of one.

My husband and I both loved this recipe, it will go into regular rotation. I thought the spice combo was perfection! I accidentally added the entire amount of salt to the beef mixture and so had to add 1/4 tsp to the cornbread and it did come out just a tad too salty; I'll be more careful next time. Also, I used buttermilk and coarse cornmeal because it's what I had on hand and it actually turned out great. I'll probably use regular cornmeal and milk next time, just thought it might be useful info for someone. Yummy dish!

Great flavor, and I am always a fan of unsweetened cornbread. If you choose to reduce the beef down all the way to a quarter cup fluid or less, I might reduce the salt. Definitely would make again!

My phone died when preparing this so I put 1/2 tsp for all the spices and the meat mixture still came out great! The cornbread is..well..horrible. So I put the meat mixture and mixed it with some tomato sauce/water and poured it over spaghetti instead. I will make this again.. but next time I will use my own cornbread recipe.

Yum! Even better the next day. I followed the recipe precisely except I didn't have any allspice, so I eliminated that. Has a very ... Mediterranean flavor. The cornbread with cheese on top turned out beautifully. I used petite cut tomatoes and a 4 cheese blend. I also used Olive oil with the onions and garlic. Will make again!!

Fabulous dish. I made this exactly as described and was so pleased. It was quick, cheap, and great. I will definitely make this more often. As a note, the cheese that I used in the cornbread was a sharp white cheddar.

Really tasty. My only recommendation would be to just cook the beef, onions, etc in an ovenproof skillet and skip the transfer to a pie plate. That makes it a one-pot meal which makes it even easier. Flavorful, easy weeknight meal!

Wowie! I can't believe how tasty this was! I will only buy grass fed beef from a local farm and most days, by the time I get there all they have left is ground beef, so I am always looking for new ways to prepare it. Followed this recipe almost exactly except I forgot the ginger, and I had no cheddar so I used feta. Honestly, I think I will leave the cheese out entirely next time, as it will save some calories and I didn't think it added anything special. But man, oh man did my husband rave about it! We will be making this again and again this fall/winter!

This was amazing and incredibly easy. I made it for my boyfriend last week, and we were beyond pleasantly surprised. We had 4 people over for dinner last night & made it again to rave reviews- in fact, one guest emailed at 9 this morning for the recipe. I took the advice of some reviewers & cut down a little on the cinnamon by a little less than half. We're spice lovers, but this is perfect without throwing in too much extra seasoning. I did toss some crushed red peppers on the top of the cornbread crust. I cannot recommend this recipe enough.

Rating: 4
After reading all the other reviews I expected a good dish but I was still pleasantly surprised how well this turned out. My husband and I both ate much more food than we normally do for dinner. We just couldn't get enough of the taste! I used the full amount of cinnamon and it was amazing!

Rating: 4
This was an awesome recipe. I was pressed for time so i used a prepackaged cornbread mix instead of flour, cornmeal and milk. Also used fresh ginger instead of dried and threw in some fresh chopped thyme! this dish could easily feed 6 and was also just as good eaten as leftovers the next two days!!

This was surprisingly scrumptious! I did change it slightly by eliminating cinnamon and using 1 tablespoon of chili powder instead. Turned out great and my super picky husband, connoisseur of cornbread, loved it. So, thank you for something super tasty to do with ground beef.

The taste of the meat was phenomenal! I used ground turkey instead of beef and would reccommend either using actual corn bread or mashed potatoes to replace the cornmeal and flour mixture becauese it was extremely dry. Will definitely make this again!

Very tasty! I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers: -for beef, used 96% lean, added carrots and went light on the spices. However, it would have been fine to add a little more spice for our taste. -for cornbread, used skim milk and added 2 tbsp sugar and 1/4 cup creamed corn. The only other thing I would have done is add jalapenos to the cornbread, but I didn't have any. Great dish!

I gave this recipe four forks because it is so easy and quick to make. The flavors are good and it makes a great fall or winter meal. I didn't have onion the last time I made it and was worried that it would end up bland but it was still good, I also only had skim milk and the corn bread turned out wonderfully. This is one of those easy things that you can almost always make without having to run to the store first.

I first tried tasted this dish when my sister prepared it for me a few weeks ago. I immediately asked for the recipe. Last night I prepared it for my household and it was a hit! I made a few changes based on what ingredients I had on hand. I substituted skim milk for whole, whole-wheat flour for all-purpose, and colby-jack cheese for cheddar. The dish is sublimely seasoned. The only change I might make is to add a touch more cayenne.

One more note to my review below - I DID half the amount of cinnamon based on a review below and I think it was a good move. It would have been too overpowering.

Rating: 3
Okay - this was a good meal, but it is very difficult for me not to tweak a recipe just a LITTLE bit. I used more than 1lb of beef - more like 1 1/2 and then put it in a casserole dish instead of a pie dish since there was more. OKAY - so eventhough I increased the amount of beef, I still used the recommended amount of spices, HOWEVER, I halved the amount of cayenne to 1/4tsp since I have small children and that was even a little too spicy - but managable. I DO wish that I had added either a second can of the tomatoes to the beef so that it was a little more moist for the cornbread topping, but it was still good without it. OH! I also added 3 diced carrots when I added the meat to give it a little more substance - and veggies. Corn would be good too...red bell peppers - whatever you like. For the cornbread, I added a can of creamed corn and it could stand to have some sugar added to it, too. You will have to compensate for adding more of a wet ingredient and give it a little more of the cornmeal, flour and soda - but it was well worth it! My husband and kids all loved it and it was so easy to do, that I will definitely be making it again! A good twist in ground beef, which I seem to always have in the fridge. p.s. I used a 7% fat content beef and can't imagine using anything fattier or it would be pretty greasy in the end.

A little disappointed with this. The cinnamon was overpowering and the corn bread was bland. Had I read all the reviews first I would have seasoned the cord bread prior to baking but the real issue for us was the spices of the meat. May try again with less cinnamon and additional flavors.

This was really good. I had no cayenne so it wasn't hot, but a nice change for ground beef. Everyone had seconds so it was a hit. I used local beef which wasn't fatty at all.

I like the idea, I like the textures, I like the ease. However, these flavors just don't blend to me. The beef mixture tastes very middle eastern, and the corn bread tastes and feels very americana/mexican. While it's a perfectly decent meal, it seems a little "what's in my cabinet today?" and I think the beef miture would be much better with mexican spices: corn, chipotle, salsa, peppers, etc. I'll try it again with my own spices, but keep the cornbread biscuit topping, which was yummy and a good compliment to the beef's heartiness.

This is one of my favorite weeknight meals and I have made it many times. I add carrots to the meat for more vegetables and use Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten Free Baking Mix in the cornbread topping and it turns out very well. Love the spices.

I'm reviewing this a second time since I'd like to up my rating to four stars. This has become a favorite in my house. As written, it's only three stars, but with the addition of a little salt, pepper, and sugar to the cornbread topping, it's definitely four stars. I like that this recipe is flexible. I make it with ground turkey sometimes, and have used soy milk and skim milk in the cornbread. And I always use whole wheat flour. Next time I will try adding some corn to the filling and topping. With a green salad, this is a wholesome, healthy, and filling meal.

We really enjoyed this recipe, though I would definitely adjust the seasoning a bit next time. The filling was bit too sweetand I would have preferred it spicier.

Just finished with this recipe and I must say it was very easy to make. It was good and I'd probably make it again. I went light on the onions because I don't like them and didn't have any allspice, but otherwise followed the directions. I like spicy food and this was very, very spicy...we were actually sweating while eating it. Still, it was flavourful and the corn bread helped with the spice issue.

I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great dish to make when you have a bunch of stuff in the fridge/freezer/cabinets and are not sure what to do with it. And it's very forgiving as well. Case in point: for the first time in my life, I didn't have any onions on hand, I didn't have any canned tomatoes or cheddar, and to top it off, I was feeling really lazy. I decided at first that I would just make a sort of chili. I threw all 4T of oil (grapeseed) in the pan by mistake, and began sauteeing the beef (1.2lbs, thanks to an over-zealous butcher). and the garlic. I was too lazy to mince the garlic so I had just crushed it. I then threw in all the spices and all the salt (by mistake). :) Instead of the tomatoes, I used the same amount of a high-quality marinara sauce I had on hand, and I added a can of black beans. I threw the cornbread mix together but had to substitute 2% milk and about 1/4 cup of pepper jack cheese. I threw the dish in the oven and 15 minutes later it was perfect. I was afraid the juices wouldn't allow the bread to cook, but it came out delicious. I'm completely impressed that the recipe tolerated so many substitutions/mistakes. :) The next time, the only thing I'll do differently is add a little more sugar (I like it sweeter).

This is a good wholesome recipe. Didn't add sugar or all spice, and used regular milk instead of whole milk. And used a bunt pan! Turned out great. Family loved it. Spices warm up the body nicely.

I've made this a few times and it always comes out well. I definitely recommend adding some seasoning to the corn bread otherwise it's really bland. I add 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. sugar and 1 tsp. ground pepper. It gives it a little flavor without competing with the rest of the dish. I also use skim milk in the corn bread with great success. I use very lean ground beef or sometimes ground turkey.

Very flavorful, especially the next day. I drained the meat before adding the tomatoes and then added a little water with the tomatoes to help cook. I used garam masala instead of allspice, since I like it better, and added 1/2 cup of raisins. Yum!

this recipe was excellent! i wasn't sure that the cinnamon, allspice and ginger wouldn't give it a sweeter taste - it turned out pleasantly spicy. the only thing i would change is to cook the beef alone and drain to decrease the fat and add some tomato paste and beef broth/red wine to give it more sauce.

i was looking for a good alternative way to prepare ground beef and found it in this recipe! i made it for a family dinner, and everyone liked it - even my son, who usually picks tomatoes out of things! my husband was particularly happy, as it reminded him of the meat pies his french-canadian father used to make! to make it quicker and easier for a night when your time is short, use packaged cornbread mix.

This recipe is a lovely concept, but sloppy (if you'll pardon the pun) execution. The meat is low in flavor and texture and there isn't enough cornbread, and in my opinion, the cornbread should be on the bottom. I will keep tinkering with the recipe but it won't bear much resemblance to this greasy pile of ho-hum.

Just made this dish tonight. My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe pretty much as it reads making slight adjustments to the spices (I put only a dash of ginger).

I had a pound of ground beef in the refrigerator, and didn't feel like chili or spaghetti sauce, which is what I usually do with ground beef. This was a good alternative...The beef flavor was great. I liked the corn bread, but it wasn't as moist as I would have liked. I will make this again.

This was good and easy, using the one- pot method. I followed the recipe almost exactly, adding all the spices. I did put some frozen corn into the meat mixture and a little in the corn bread. Hubby thought it was a little hotter than he liked, but that could be from lack of accurate measure - a pinch here, a dab there! Cooked the meat in a cast-iron skillet, drained off the fat before adding tomatoes, and put the corn bread on top. Will make it again.

I couldn't belive this was actually quite tasty--not to mention kid friendly. I used a pack of Jiffy sweet corn bread mix just for simplicity and was very happy with the results. It also reheats well. I plan on adapting this for chicken with more of a creamy/spicy/pepper jack base.

I loved this, although I altered the recipe so much I don't know if I'm qualified to make that kind of judgement anymore. I substituted ground turkey for beef and added a diced green bell pepper with the onion, then omitted most of the spices and instead added a pouch of Old El Paso taco seasoning, one clove of garlic, and a dash of cayenne pepper. I used about 1/2 cup of canned tomatoes instead of a whole can. I followed the basic cornbread recipe for the topping but added half a diced onion, half a cup of frozen corn, some cilantro, half of a diced red bell pepper, and crumbled three strips of browned bacon into it. I also nearly doubled the cheese, and next time I'll do the same to the salt. I served it covered with fresh diced tomatoes. I thought it was delicious but my boyfriend, who usually always has seconds, dutifully ate one portion and then mowed down on a Lil' Debbie nutty bar. After interrogation he revealed that he had been put off by what I had called it (Taco Pie), so I have plans to serve it again next week under the moniker "Southwestern Yummy Bomb".

The beef mixture was really good. I found the corn bread to be a bit bland but I used regular cheddar that I had on hand. Next time I'll try sharp cheddar and cilantro as another user suggested.

I used the skillet that I browned the meat in, added the corn bread on top and put the skillet in the oven.

I saw immediately I could "mess about" with it. I changed a few seasonings to Chinese...sort of. Hoisin and some chipotle dried/crushed flakes with a little frozen corn made it a winner with the grandkids. Of course, a bit of chopped cilantro went into the cornbread batter. Yummmmm....
