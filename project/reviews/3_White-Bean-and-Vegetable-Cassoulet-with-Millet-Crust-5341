I experimented a bit and used double the millet it called for (1.5 c) but only 3.5 c water and scant 1/2 c breadcrumbs. Once the water was absorbed, I added olive oil and some butter (about 1/4c), added the 2nd part of basil to that and put it on the top. I would use a lot more harissa next time and if making this way, increase the tomatoes

WOW! Let me just say that anyone who made this and didn't love it clearly did not follow the recipe. I made this exactly as described with exception of the millet, which I had to substitute bulgar for since I couldn't find it. It was incredible. The harissa is absolutely ESSENTIAL, the flavor compliments the cumin and ties everything together. They sell harissa in a tube I found at my local co-op. I literally could not stop eating this. I will be making this over and over again. I found it funny that most the reviewers made this in the winter, because the ingredients are spring/summer seasonal. I was able to use onions, carrots, garlic, squash, and green beans from my CSA box!

Wonderfull recipe! Everyone always wants the recipe. I have made it about half a dozen times and it is a hit with vegs and meat eaters! You can play with the ingredients and it is always great! Definately a keeeper!

I was expecting something more shepherd's pie-ish -- definitely not this. Anyway, the cumin and red pepper seemed to overwhelm everything all the veggies' different flavors.

I had to use zucchini, couldn't find summer squash in November. Also had to leave out the green beans, I don't think anything other than fresh green beans would work well. It was popular with everyone, vegetarian or not, and I took it to a potluck and it was a hit. I did use a vegetable boullion cube instead of plain water for the millet.

This was one of the WORST recipies that I have ever tasted. The flavors didn't go, and it was a waste of time to make.

This is one of my favorite vegetarian recipes for fall and winter. It is very warming, filling and tasty, yet healthy. The millet adds a nice subtle flavor to the recipe. This is also excellent warmed up for leftovers the next day.

Tast, aromatic, and colorful! My guests loved this recipe, which I have made a number of times, both as a main course and side dish. Preparing most of the dish a day ahead, and adding the topping the next day, works very well. I cooked the millet about 3 minutes and drained off the excess water (I like the millet slightly crunchy) before combining it with seasoned breadcrumbs.

Everyone thought it was delicious, not just the vegetarians in the group. Eat it immediately, it did not reheat well - not even in the microwave.
