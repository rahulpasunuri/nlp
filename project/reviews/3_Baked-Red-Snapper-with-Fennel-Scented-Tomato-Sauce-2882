We are not big fish eaters, but we made this with a 0.9lb fresh ling cod fillet, a 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes, and doubled the red pepper. My husband and I really enjoyed the results -- the flavor and the tender flakiness of the fish was a delight. We will definitely make this again! Especially as it is so nutritious.

This dish was okay. It was easy enough, but it was rather bland (and I added garlic) overall.

This is definitely a keeper. As others have mentioned, I added garlic. And my local fish monger was out of red snapper so I used plain old New England Codfish with excellent results. A great dish when you don't have a lot of time to fuss around, especially since you can make the sauce the day before.

The fish was a little dry, will reduce cooking time and cover for portion next time. The peppery tomato flavor was very nice though.

Also added garlic and 1/2 the tomatoes. Easy and healthy.

This is an absolutely fantastic dish! We ate every bite - nothing left over. Thanks to earlier posters who suggested fewer tomatoes.

Fearing blandness, I added a clove of garlic and a large shallot. The result was fantastic-- perfect for a friend who's usually not a fan of fish!

Easy to make, healthy and delicious! I substituted the snapper with tilapia and served it over basamati rice. I would definitely make it again.

Being a college student, I try to find healthy, easy recipes. I replaced all the good stuff with some tomato sauce and had the fish with some brown rice, and it was great. Very quick and easy. I actually used Tilapia instead of snapper, and it worked well.

I thought the recipe very easy to make but unimpressed by the end result. My husband and I thought it to be flavorless. I have come across better recipes for fish and will pitch this one.

This dish was extremely easy to prepare. We both loved it, and couldn't stop ourselves from going back for more. I took the previous advice and halved the tomatoes. Great dish!!

Very easy and delicious. I made this for two, but only used half the amount of tomatoes (a 14.5 oz. can). That was plenty! I think more tomatoes would have overwhelmed it.

I made this for six, but instead of tripling the tomatoes, I doubled them (and tripled everything else). It was terrific and easy and we all loved it. There was a little leftover that I had the next day - by then the sauce was positively dreamy. Next time I'll make the sauce a day ahead.
