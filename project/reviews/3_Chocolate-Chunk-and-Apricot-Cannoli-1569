I used this recipe as a base and substituted blood red orange marmalade and dark chocolate. It was so good my boyfriend (who is Italian) jokingly said old Italian ladies wouldn't believe a Chinese girl made it!

Super quick, easy, and tasty. A plastic bag with the corner cut off substitutes for a pastry bag.

I think I'll forever be looking for a recipe that matches the cannolis you get in Boston's North End-- smooth and sweet filling, without any additions of candied fruit or whatever. But I thought I'd try this one because it more closely resembled the cannolis folks are used to out here in the desert. But this just didn't work for me. The flavors didn't combine well...I think the apricot and chocolate (while normally a flavor combination I adore) didn't go with the coffee. I'll keep looking.

This was a fine recipe, definately not like the cannoli cream you get in NY bakeries but what can you do. I omitted the apricot and used it as a cake filling. Ill keep searching for the best cannoli recipe but for now this will work.

My wife Carmella made this dish for me and da boys. I work in the Garbage business, so we get hungry a lot at work. My kids, AJ and Meadow also loved it. Good going!

I made it with my own homemade strawberry preserves instead of apricot and used Scharffenberger bittersweet chocolate. I also substituted finely-grated bittersweet chocolate instead of coffee to make it "Mormon friendly" for our LDS guests. I had never had cannoli, but my husband, who loves cannoli said it was as good as the best he's had! It also wasn't as sweet as most deserts. Also I spooned the filling in because a pastry bag was just absurd--the chocolate just got stuck in it. The filling was soft but firmed up perfectly after an hour in the fridge.

I haven't made this recipe before..but on the missing indgredients..My family ususally adds crushed peppermint, touch of vanilla and mini chocolate chips to the ricotta mixture and dip the ends in ground pistacios. Take it from an Italian who knows.

I found this recipe to be quite good used as a variation to the traditional recipe...we enjoyed it. Canolli recipes are hard to come by...and I enjoy adding to my collection. Thanks so much

Followed the directions EXACTLY, except mixed ingredients by hand. Added sugar and vanilla to taste and it was tasty. Cannoli filling came out a bit thin. Maybe one should use cream cheese instead of ricotta cheese?

This needs many ingredients that are missing. Real cannolis have sugar, vanilla, and other ingredients I can't remember. Would be nice if Cannoli shell recipe was added.

I would have really liked to have had a recipe to make my own cannoli shells. The filling was a little bland, so I added about 1/2 cup more ricotta.

Too creamy and bland. The filling needs more flavor and needs to be sweeter.
