Delicious! My guests loved it, even though I had a slight problem with it- the crust shrank when baked, so when I added the filling it seeped between the crust and my baking dish. I was worried it would create a soggy mess, but it was still fantastic! Anyone know where I went wrong with the crust?

I make this so often that I'm thinking of buying a blowtorch for the topping. (The foil collar/broiler method is kind of a pain.) A few changes: I use a smaller 9" pan so the filling layer is thicker, and double the orange zest. Use any good butter pastry for the crust.

Made this last weekend for a spring dinner. Not difficult but time consuming. Would roll the pastry out thinner next time. Was not particularly orang-ey; most thought it was a creme brulee tart, which I guess it sort of is. Took much longer than 25 minutes to set up. Should have sifted the powdered sugar for the carmelized top - and it did not caramelize all the way to the crust edge. But everyone liked it - I guess I just had higher hopes.

I made this twice this year for events at my office, the last one a retirement party. Everyone loved it and thought it was elegant in presentation as well.

Fabulous dessert with a professional presentation. I made this for our gourmet dinner group of 12 people and everyone loved it. The serving size is not very generous but after a big meal it was adequate. Next time I may add fresh blackberries as a garnish.
