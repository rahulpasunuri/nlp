I loved these - I added in a cup of oats to the flour mixture b/c I remember some apricot oatty bars I loved as a kid and that was a nice fit. The one thing I might try next time is cooking apricots down a bit instead of using jam. Straight jam is a bit overwhelming in terms of sweetness and I have a BIG sweet tooth.

This recipe is delicious and gets raves every time I make it. I have also made it with marmalade and seedless raspberry preserves to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Two cautions: (1) don't overprocess; it should look crumbly and (2) check oven 5 min before the end so the edges do not scorch. I'm not a fussy baker, and this recipe is quick, low cleanup, and very satisfying.

I found it slightly too sweet, but delicious anyway. In trying to reconstruct something I'd had at a local bakery, I sprinkled some finely chopped rosemary over the jam, and before the topping. Yum!

These are very easy to make, and my kids loved them. However, these cookies would not win a beauty contest. I baked one batch in a glass pan and another in a metal pan, and the ones in the metal pan burned on the edges before the center was cooked, so I suggest baking in glass. Also the double batch was a bit too much for my food processor, the dough mixed unevenly. Yes, I'll make these again, perhaps with cherry or raspberry preserves.

Very easy and reliable. I often use a stand mixer with paddle attachment to make the crust. Also good with raspberry preserves and walnuts or almonds. However, I always use at least a cup of preserves for apricot or raspberry.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and put in a 13 by 9 pan. It needed a couple minutes longer in the over. I also added chopped up dried apricots and that helped to add to the apricot flavor. I probably only used about a cup of the walnuts.

Yummy and easy! The Cuisinart brings the dough together in a snap. I added extra cinnamon, used pecans instead of walnute, & increaed the preserves about a 1/4C. As another reviewer suggested, I baked at 400 (rather than 425) for 20 minutes. They hadn't cooled enough by the time we were ready to eat them, so they fell apart when sliced, but the next day they had firmed up beautifully. Perhaps next time I'll just use parchment instead of the tin foil & butter routine. Used a 7.5" by 11" Pyrex dish.

These were pretty tasty, but pretty ho-hum in comparison to the apricot-orange shortbread bars, which are similarly easy to make, and far superior in taste (everyone always raves when I make those). I made the recipe as is, but added 1.5 Tbsp of Cointreau to the preserves, which added a little extra taste.

I made these for Rosh Hashana. I used ultra-rich butter (Strauss). They were delicious and got rave reviews. Everyone asked for the recipe

oh my these were SO easy to make and SO delicious! I brought these on my 4th of July camping trip and everyone loved them. I used my cousin's homemade peach jam and it worked great!

I know why people are having problems with too much butter as I made the same error and ended up with a cake-like batter, rather than the crumbly texture I was expecting--we read the recipe wrong--it only calls for 3/4 cup butter--not 1 1/2 cups (that refernce it to the sticks). Yes, it is a silly mistake, but easy to make. Still very tasty though and I look forward to making it correctly.

This recipe was just what I was looking for - easy and oh so good. I will make it again and again. I did however try to use a larger pan and found that I needed to make one and a half times the recipe to fill a 13 x 9 inch pan - perfect size for major holiday baking. Yum!

In my previous review, I meant to advise that the 1/2 cup of preserves be warmed to room temp. This makes them easier to spread evenly with the backside of a spoon or pastry brush. Although I have done so once, I do not double the amount of preserves (as some suggest); subtlety tantilizes.

Fantastic - incredibly easy and fast, and so tasty and sweet. I ended up using 2/3 c of jam. Also, next time I'll melt the jam a little, b/c it was a little hard to spread on the bottom dough layer (which is a bit crumbly, even though I patted it down). Rich but not heavy - I will make this repeatedly!

I made this with Sarabeth's Apricot Peach Preserves and it was fantastic.

I made the recipe as printed except skipped the foil liner. My guests raved about these bars. Very easy to make, too. A nice alternative to chocolate desserts.

I loved this recipe and everyone who ate them also raved. Very high reward for very little effort. Not sure why others had problems. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems and my less experienced daughter made them and also was successful. I cut them with a bench knife (aka dough scraper), which is a tip I've picked up along the way to make clean cuts for brownies and other bars. Then I cut the squares diagonally for a pretty presentation.

these were great, not sure why so many had problems. easy to make with no modifications. my guests loved them, I wish there some leftovers

This was so easy and just wonderful! I added 3/4 cup preserves, though. One half cup seemed a little skimpy.

I'm not a baker, but the butter to flour ratio is off. Added some additional flour to make dough manageable, put in a 9 x 9 pan with a 10 oz. jar of Dickinson's Apricot preserves. These are sooooooo good!!

Brought to an Easter dinner, they certainly did remind everyone of rugelach. But a little too dry -- used Polamer apricot preserves, almonds, baked in 8x8 pan for 20 minutes in 400 degree oven. Corners were scorched. Next time will use walnuts as directed and watch more closely at the end.

Mmmm. My hubby made these when I was laid up with an Achilles tendon injury. I may injure the other, just to have more! Rich & delicious!

I found the dough a little difficult to deal with - but just added some flour to my fingers and it was fine. I also substituted a different jam as my husband does not like apricots.

I made this delicious slice without amendments to the recipe, having discovered that a stick of butter is 125 gm or so, for the cake stall at my daughter's school fete. Each plate disappeared fast. I have since made it again with raspberry jam and pecans, which my family and I enjoyed even more. This slice looks and tastes far more complex than it is to make. It's a definite keeper!

Bars from heaven. Yes, reminiscent of rugelach but much quicker. Made three times so far, I do not change its proportions, yet the recipe adapts well to other ingredients. I have made these with apricot (my favorite) and with raspberry (a bit sweeter but delicious). Using a pastry blender (which I prefer to a food processor) is easy and about as quick; just follow the recipe's procedure. Although my oven is accurate, I have found that baking for 20 minutes at 400° yields a golden brown top with no scorching of the walnuts. Also, a 7.5x11-inch pan (same area as 9x9) works well. So does an 8x8 pan if given the recipe's extra five minutes. Just keep an eye on it; bars are done when filling bubbles and top is golden brown.

great, even with pecans substituting the walnuts. walnuts might give more flavor though. will try next time. or almonds. definitely a keeper recipe in our house.

I can't believe how easy and delicious these bar cookies are! While they are extremely rich, they're fast to prepare and taste better the next day. Great for packed lunches, tea or coffee time. Even delicious with a scoop of ice cream to make a special but homey dessert. My only critique is that there is too much butter in this recipe, as butter was melted in shallow pools under parchment paper. I think 1 cup should be enough the next time I make this. Because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, I made the following substitutions: orange jam (brand from Europe) and used whole wheat pastry flour (instead of all-purpose). I used sliced almonds (instead of walnuts), but only put them on the dough about 8 minutes prior to the end of the baking time (to prevent them burning). This recipe is definitely a keeper! It adapts to jam/nut substitutions and is delicate in flavour, not too sweet and keeps well. I plan to bake another batch and send it in to my daughter's high school for her teachers to enjoy.

These were pretty good. Would have used chunkier jam or doubled the amount of jam as the apricot flavor was lost. I think spreading them out in a bigger pan would have improved them as well, base was too thick. Would make these again for sure.

I followed the recipe to a T - although, I did not use the full amount of walnuts. If I make this again, I would consider using a bigger pan to thin out the crust or reducing the amount of dough. I didn't like the ratio of dough to apricot. It was still good, and others really enjoyed it.

Despite having an oven whose temperature fluctuates, and butchering the recipe, these turned out quite well. I subbed spelt flour for regular, used turbinado sugar instead of white, and raspberry/cranberry jam instead of apricot. Oh, and by accident added a cup of butter. Of course they were a little greasy, but after blotting the top they turned out pretty well.

thought this one was a bit off... a bit too sugary without much else going on... maybe it needs a little more apricot and brown sugar instead of white... i may try this...

This needed much more baking time. When baked according to directions, the base was too soft and the bars fell apart. Taste was good.

Just as advertised. Yum. This is one of the tastiest and easiest recipes I've found in your magazine in years.
