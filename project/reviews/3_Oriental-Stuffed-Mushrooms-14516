I agree that these are not particularly oriental, but they were good. Blanching to prevent wrinkly skins is a good tip.

My guests loved these. Not at all runny, the bread crumbs absorb the moisture. Use 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of the 4 tsp onion.

Ugh. We couldn't taste anything Asian about it. I followed the recipe exactly, but they tasted watery and flavorless. If you want to try it, I'd highly recommend not blanching the mushrooms. Maybe that would help.

The soy sauce and sesame seeds add a delightful oriental flare to this recipe.
