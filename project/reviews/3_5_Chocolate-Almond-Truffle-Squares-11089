very easy to make and delicious. I am using this as a birthday gift for a friend who has a gluten allergy. I have to admit, the first batch I made I used dark dark chocolate- 70% cocoa and it was rich and decadent, but not very sweet. the next batch I used bitter sweet ghiradelli bars and used dried cherries and replaced the amaretto with 2 TBSP of vanilla extract. I also used a little more heavy cream- an extra 2 TBSP perhaps. delish!

Simplicity itself...my only recommendation is to divide the chocolate for the top and bottom, otherwise, you may do like me and use a bit too much on the base layer, leaving not a lot to drizzle on top. Also, I found I could use a bit more amaretto...although I did slosh a bit out when I first started stirring it in to the chocolate-cream mixture!

I've made these "truffles" since the first time they printed the recipe. Everyone always raves about the flavor.

I wasn't too thrilled with the recipe. the taste didn't overly impress me, and when I cut the truffles, they 'split' so I could only slavage half of it to be cut in presentable squares. Not my favorite!

One of many truffles I make for Xmas each year, as a gift that is never returned. I've taken to using almond slivers, and mixing them into the melted chocolate, before spreading into the glass dish I use. I find better texture and the taste is better complemented by the amaretto. Also, very simple to make!

Such a great and easy recipe. Everyone loved these last year - I am so glad I found the recipe again on your website.
