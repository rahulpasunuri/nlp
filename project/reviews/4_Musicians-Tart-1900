Rich and very sweet, served with creme fraiche to cut the sweetness a bit. Not at all difficult to make. The nut and caramel topping is gorgeous. I probably could have found dried pears if I'd looked hard enough, but, instead, and after seeing how thin the pear puree was in the baby food, I just used two firm ripe fresh pears in place of the dried plus nectar. After simmering and pureeing in the processor, it worked out to a delicious thick paste. I'm thinking of using some pear liqueur as well next time. Only difficulty arose with loosening the tart pan sides after baking. Had it been a spring form, no problem, but tart pans with removable bottoms are different, you've got to push up on the bottom to extract the tart. I found that the caramel had securely glued the sides of the pan to the tart and there was no apparent way of loosening it. Instead, I ran a knife around the ins and outs of the rim, which was both time consuming and broke little pieces off the crust. Maybe I missed something here. Anyway, it was a delightful dessert and one I'll happily make again.

Hard to believe it was almost 20 years ago when I first made this recipe. I was then so excited about it I prepared it several times over the next couple of years, then never made it again until this New Year's eve dinner. Well it did not disappoint. After all these years, still a winner. P.S. could not find pear nectar, so used dried apricots intead of dried pears, and used apricot nectar instead. Even better than original.

This was quite the recipe to make! It ended up as a dense, high protein dessert that was quite unique. I can see why it might be sold in cofee shops. I would suggest reducing the dark brown sugar to 1/8 cup. I also followed suggestions from other reviewers to use pear baby food instead of pear nectar and dried pears. I simply couldn't find any.

Delicious! If you like dates and nuts, this is your recipe! Also, did anyone just fall in love with this crust recipe? I found myself just eating handfuls of the dough scraps it was so good! My only substitution was brown rice syrup for corn syrup, but the caramel bubbled oh-so-nicely, and only a couple of nuts got scorched on top for not being down inside the caramel as it baked. Once I removed (and ate) those offenders, it was picture perfect! I'm going to have to come back to this one for the crust at the very least, and I might even throw in some Fiori di Sicilia in the crust dough to make it that much more fragrant!

Outstanding recipe.

This is definitely one different tart! The smell it creates in your kitchen is almost enough to convince you to burn your tongue on it the instant it gets out of the oven... The texture is a wonderful chewy-crunchy thing, and the dried fruit paste that lines the bottom of the tart creates a sweetness that is a great compliment to the slight saltiness of the nuts and caramel. If you want an unusual dessert that is rather simple but looks professionally done, this is your tart. :-)

I followed the advice to use pear baby food as well. This was unique and tasty -- good with coffee. High energy type dessert to serve alongside a chocolate dessert as an alternative. I'd make again for just the right occasion.

A cook in my gourmet group made this with the recipe I gave her. She read the reviews after which she used a variety of dried fruits, and along with the nuts called for she also used chopped macadamias. It was absolutely fantastic!

A big hit with all adult tasters. I did swap molasses+white sugar for the brown sugar and corn syrup--results were great. Also, I couldn't find dried pears but found a mixed dried fruit that included a scant cup of pears.

Yet again i made the Musician's Tart friends and a French Horn player. They all loved it. I think it serves 8 instead of the stated six. Gets rave reviews each time it is served.

I loved this recipe. Like other reviewers, I had trouble finding dried pears. I made a few adjustments that went perfectly. I used more dates (the nice soft kind like Medjool) and then instead of the pear nectar and dried pears I used a large jar of pear baby food. This all pureed in the processor to a perfect paste consistancy which worked well spread on the tart. I am also lazy, so I used a rolled up crust from the supermarket. It worked out great. I will also note that this is an absolutely perfect recipe for people with Interstitial Cystitis. Oddly enough, with a VERY limiting diet, everything in this recipe is IC friendly. A HUGE plus!

Loved it! I now make this cake twice a week for a cafe I supply. It was an instant hit. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 10"deep dish pie. It looks great with choc dipped dates on top and choc drizzled over it. Cuts perfectly too. I took the advice given and held back on the sweetness. Definitely worth making again and again.

I love this tart. I made a few changes because like the other reviewers I couldn't find dried pears. I used dried apricots and dates and water instead of nectar. This may have cut down on some of the sweetness others have commented on. For the nuts I had hazelnuts, almonds and pistachios (toasted the almonds and hazelnuts). I may substitute the hazelnuts next time but all in all it was an excellant dessert. Not too sweet, beautiful and perfect with a cup of tea. My new fav!!

YUM! This was delicious, although I did alter the recipe a bit. I used dried cranberries, pears, apricots, figs, dates and raisins. I also added some crystalized ginger, which definitely added a "kick" to the filling. After reading the reviews I used less sugar in the filling. I also used pecans in the topping in addition to the pine nuts, cashews and almonds.

Afraid I have to agree with the cook from Pioneer, CA. Way too sweet!! Nearly like a nutty caramel bar!

We are certainly in the minority, but neither my husband nor myself particularly liked this tart. I had really been looking forward to it, given the high ratings, but we found it too sweet and rich for our taste.

This is incredibly good. The dough is very easy to nake and the fruit and nut mixture is just delicious. having said that I will admit that mine deviated significantly from the printed recipe and what I saw on the television show this wee. Like some others I could not find dried pears, so I used the mixture. Neither could I find pear nectar. I bought a 6 oz can of sliced pears planning to use the juice instead. I could not get the cooked fruit to puree in my blender (the processor was dirty from mixing the dough). So I added the rest of the liquid from the can with no success. I started adding the pear slices thinking I needed something softer to start the puree. Then I realized I had left out the dates. I ended up with a very coarse chop of all the fruit. However, I was very pleased with the results and plan to make it that way again. The tart is so rich I got many more servings than 6.

Make this recipe. Looks beautiful, tastes fabulous. With a side of fresh whipping cream, fresh berries, this is an dessert beyond compare.

A beautiful & tasty tart! This is what you want: something that's relatively easy to do, that looks great and tastes even better.

Fantastic! I don't give 4 forks easily but this was relatively easy to make, it was delicious, and the presentation was professional. I served this to a dinner party of 8 and put a scoop of Dreyer's coffee flavored ice cream on the side. I have lots of extra ingredients so I'll be making it again soon.

I made this the night before my paella dinner. I used a springform baking pan and served it on a decorative footed plate. It is a beautiful dessert with the glazed nuts on top. It cut easily and I served it with fresh whipped cream and coffee. I did not find it too sweet. I used the mixed fruit as one reader suggested. It doesn't matter that much as everything is cooked down anyway. A definite repeat.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was great. Made several changes, however, that I think improved it. Filling seemed to sweet and thick. Added grated orange peel and lemon peel and a slosh of brandy. Everyone loved it.

I have made this two times and love it. I like serving it with whipped cream. A friend made a Spanish Fish Stew for dinner and this was a great dessert to follow in the Spanish theme. Try it,,,,,you'll like it,,,,,Mikey liked it

I made this for my father's birthday in 1992 when it was first published. Now he requests it every birthday; I have made it so many times I lost the recipe and was grateful to find it on the internet!! Know what I am having Thanksgiving this year!!

A great finish after a spicy meal! I could not find enough dried pears, so instead I used one package of dried mixed fruits (pears, peaches and apricots)and the required amount of dates. It probably cut down on the sweetness a little. I served it with a dollop of caramel-port sauce and a drizzle of fresh cream on the side. Definitely a keeper!

My "foodie" friends and I featured this as the dessert for a Mediterranean dinner. It was an outstanding success. The crust is similar to a shortbread cookie, so follow all of the chilling stages carefully.

I've made this tart three times since it appeared in Bon Appetit and have received rave reviews each time. Absolutely delicious!
