I think this recipe is delicious and make it regularly as a dip. For a thicker, creamier texture, I recommend substituting a good-quality (read: live culture) plain yogurt for buttermilk. A word of warning: the dry mustard and garlic get stronger - tasting the longer the dressing sits! If you're making it a day or two in advance you might reduce those ingredients.

I originally reviewed this dressing way back in 2004 and I'm still making it. It's delicious, but calling it a "ranch" dressing is a misnomer. Maybe that's why some people gave it a bad review. Probably they were expecting something more commercially "ranch-ish." A better name for this dressing would be "Low Fat Herbed Buttermilk Dressing." Even so, I can't believe several people thought this dressing was terrible. I mean, helloooooooooo. Did you read the ingredient list first to make sure you like the taste of each individual ingredient? Yes, this has a strong garlic taste. If you don't love garlic, don't make this recipe, or leave it out. The same goes for the herbs. Decent low-fat, low-cal dressings are very few and far between. The stuff they sell in the supermarket is barely edible. As far as I'm concerned this is one of the best low-fat, low-cal salad dressings I've ever had. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Blecchh! The taste is so-so, and then follows an overpowering wallop of garlic. I let it sit overnight in the fridge, but it tasted the same this morning and I had to throw it. I followed the recipe EXACTLY using the freshest herbs, buttermilk, etc., but clearly something wasn't right. I may or may not try it again just to see if I used a bad ingredient.

I think it's way too runny. Next time, I'm going to add less buttermilk in hopes of making it a bit thicker. And I ditched the vinegar as well. The taste of the dressing is fine.

I'd never tried making my own ranch dressing before but this was easy and yummy. I added some garlic powder, a bit of dill and some paprika. Turned out great. Definatly won't be going back to the bottled ranch any time soon.

This was good for a lowfat dressing, although it was slightly watery- but I will make it again next time, just using a higher ratio of full fat mayo. I guess that defies the purpose of the recipe, but the flavor was great aside from the consistency. If you are not concerned about fat, make this with real sour cream and mayo, it is a tasty dressing and with enough herbs has a really pretty green color.

A BIG FAT ZERO! I cannot believe others gave this recipe such rave reviews.

Fantastic!! I too can't believe this is low fat! I reduced it more by using 1% buttermilk (all I could find) and non-fat mayo and it was still delicious. I think any herbs would work, including dried. The 2nd time I made it I only had dried thyme and I couldn't taste the difference. 2nd time I also used more fresh basil and halved the cider vinegar. Next time I'll skip it completely. One reviewer thought it was more ranch-like without the vinegar and I agree. Definite keeper. Much better than bottled low fat ranch and it doesn't have the high sodium of bottled stuff. Good on fish and turkey burgers too!

This is the best low-cal dressing I've ever had, bottled or homemade. I've made it several times and it's always delicious, especially after letting it sit for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend. I've made it with dried herbs and with fresh, and it comes out great either way. I don't like non-fat sour cream so I use light sour cream instead. I also use artificial sweetener instead of sugar. Comes out sooooooo delish it's hard to believe it's low-fat and low-cal! I do add pepper but the one time I added salt I ended up throwing the batch away. It's definitely better w/o salt and that's from a diehard salt lover!

I've made this twice now, and made a few changes the second time. I think it tastes more "ranch-ish" without the cider vinegar. And though I am a diehard garlic fan, I recommend using about half the amount called for if you're going to store the dressing for a few days. It gets more and more pungent as it sits. For convenience, I double the recipe, bring half to work, and leave the rest at home. It lasts for at least a week.

Perfect in every way!! I made a few changes - added salt and pepper (otherwise a little bland) and added 2x the basil!! everyone loved!

This dressing was very good. Couldn't believe it was low fat!

I really enjoyed this low-fat dressing. I substituted fresh dill for the basil and thyme, because that's what I had on hand. Delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

At last, I have found a low fat salad dressing, which does not taste like low fat. As I use a lot of Buttermilk in my cooking I was delighted to see this dressing has plenty of it. Instead of fresh herbs I used fresh mint - it was delicious. This will be my regular salad dressing when I am eating non-fat.

Very good and easy to make. Next time, if I don't have fresh herbs, cracked peppercorns would be equally delicious.

Instead of addinging the herbs, I put in crushed peppercorns. It was very light in tasting without the added fat. I will use this one again.
