Jook is a personal favorite of mine and I have made it for over 30 years. My changes are; I use ground chicken and make meat balls with water chestnut and 5 spice salt, pepper and an egg along with the scallions. I make the meatballs small. I also use broken rice. This rice is usually quite dry and so when it is made into a soup it absorbs a ton of the broth, which I make from left over chicken backs that I have added garlic, onion, carrot and ginger

good, but it'll be awesome if you substitute low sodium chicken broth for half of the water.
