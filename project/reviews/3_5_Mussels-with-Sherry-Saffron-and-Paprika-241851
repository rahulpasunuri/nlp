I agree with the writer who compared mussels to pizza: it's hard to go wrong, it's basically fine food. But this recipe added zero to the taste, and in a way, detracted from basic good ol' mussels, in my opinion. I'm sorry I chose t make this recipe over the other recipes given 4 forks.

We have made this recipe a half dozen times. Simple yet complex flavors. It never gets old. We have great luck with pkg of frozen mussels; can't tell the difference.

We substituted Calamari for the Mussels and the dish was excellent. Seafood swimming in a sweet, tomato broth with some good bread and good wine. perfect

Reviewed this yesterday, adding a post script. Since I made the full recipe for just me, there were leftovers. Zapped them in the microwave for 2 minutes and tossed with linguini. Wonderful!

Very subtle, very good.Used 1/2 tsp regular paprika and 1/4 tsp smokey as suggested by other reviewers, delicious. The best part was sopping up the tomato/broth mixture with a good baguette. A glass of white wine and a lovely green salad with toasted pine nuts complimented the mussels. I am feeling no pain!

Made this twice. Ssubstituted white wine for the Sherry as previous suggested along with the smoked paprika. Wow! Excellent flavors with the saffron. Soaked up the sauce with warm, crusty bread.

A wonderful recipe for mussels and an easy one too! The gentle flavors complimented the mussels really well. Will definitely do again and serve more bread for mopping up the sauce.

I followed the recipe to the T and it was very good. Next time I would use a dry white wine instead of the sherry, which has a very strong flavor. I also think smoked paprika would add more flavor as the other reviewers said. My husband and I loved the broth left over after the mussels were polished off, so we sopped it all up with crusty french bread. The good thing about this recipe is it is very quick and easy, and mussels are cheap, even at Whole Foods!

I have made this 3 or 4 times already and it's always a hit. Simple, quick, but lots of flavour. The fact that it doesn't use or need cream makes it healthy too.

Have made this twice now and it's superb. I'm such a fan of saffron as well as paprika and it gives a lovely flavour to the mussels. Yum!!

Excellent recipe! Definitely use fire roasted tomatoes, smoked paprika and a quality sherry. I didn't have or use saffron but didn't feel anything was missing.I removed the mussels when they were done, took the pan off the heat, and whisked in about 1/4 cup cream..it elevated the dish from first course to entree. I served it with crispy french bread to enjoy every last drop! Restaurant quality!!

I thought the dish was ho-hum until I added the mussels at the end. the blend of flavours is wonderful and the recipe was quick and easy. I'd definitely make it again.

Very nice. I didn't add the tomatoes. Nice balance of flavors.

This not only is an excellent recipe. It is quick and easy to make, yet restaurant quality. Ask your market for the freshest mussels as we did. We also used 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika and 1/2 teaspoon regular paprika. Really a top quality recipe.

Fantastic and easy. This is a flavorful dish that takes no time to prepare especially if you use canned diced tomatoes. I used the smoked paprika and it added some wonderful depth to the dish. For some added heat you might throw in some red pepper flakes, but as is it is a keeper!

Good but not by any means the best mussels I've ever had. It was easy to prepare, but I will try a different recipe next time I make mussels.

Simple and easy to make! I added clams, scallops and shirmp to mine, plus a little beer - Everyone LOVED it!

This recipe made me think of the saying 'there is no bad pizza, because even bad pizza is good pizza' (or something like that.) That being said the mussels were good, but all mussels are good in my mind. The flavors just didn't come across that well for me.

This has such great flavor. I'm sorry that I had to toss so many mussels from the bag(cracked and open)before adding to the mix. I think this would be perfect over a bed of pasta

Delicious! What a nice change of pace from my usual roster of shellfish. Simple and quick. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful!!!!! I made this recipe tonight for dinner and I am replete! My husband and I polished off all the mussels. The recipe is quick, easy and oh so flavorful. The only change I made was to add 1/4 tsp smoked paprika that was suggested by another reviewer. This is now in my keeper file and I highly suggest this recipe to everyone, it is delish!

Excellent simple supper with good, crisp bread and a salad. A definite keeper.

Easy and delicious. I added 1/4 teaspoon of smoked Spanish paprika otherwise perfect along with large salad for a quick dinner. I will be making this again!
