A non-spinach lover gobbled this up. Moi, j'adore spinach, and this dish is more than the sum of its parts. Which means I will definitely make it often.

Made this as part of Valentine's Day dinner. Turned out great, although it made WAY more breadcrumbs than were necessary. I did increase the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, since 2 Tbsp just didn't seem like enough.

Like several other reviewers I halved the spinach and used the full amounts of the other ingredients. Also added some Romano with the Parmesan and I think I let the spinach wilt just a little too much. We found it to have an odd taste and won't make it again.

this is a big hit!- i made it as a side fot thanksgiving and it was the one thing there were no leftovers of. i used storebought seasoned breadcrumbs then put it in the oven to crisp up some more with a dallop of butter- it held fine since dinner was a little delayed- will make again and again its easy

I thought the bread crumbs didn't add much, but loved the spinach/sun-dried tomato combo.

This was one of the tastiest ways I have ever had spinach prepared. I have to disagree with the cook from Raleigh, though. I think the breadcrumbs made the dish! However, there seemed to be enough breadcrumb mixture for at least twice as much spinach (just saved some for later), and I admit to a couple of minor modifications. Used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and increased the amount of sundried tomatoes, both of which I think made it even better.

Really enjoyed the dish, but additionally loved the fact that the nutritional content was listed. Wish that was the case with all other recipes. As a diabetic, I also wish the Carbohydrate content of recipes was given.

I am not a fan of cooked spinach, but I loved this.

This dish only took about 2 minutes to prepare - it's QUICK! I don't think the breadcrumbs added anything to the dish. Next time I would omit them.

I found this dish had an "off" taste which I think may have been the parmesan combined with the spinach. Not a hit for me!

Great side dish recipe but then I love spinach. For 2 of us I used about 6 ounces of spinach with double the garlic and sun dried tomatoes. I also ended up using fine dried Italian bread crumbs (about 1/3 cup) sauteed with until dark golden and then added grated parmesan and stirred until it was nice and crumbly. It needed additional parmesan which added to the flavor and turned out perfectly.

We loved this recipe. We used 1/2 as much spinach, twice as much garlic & 1/2 as much of the sundried tomatoes. We served it with oven roasted, garlic laced pork tenderloin. Next time we are going to add a few ounces of pancetta to the dish.

Different and tasty, but not sure if sun dried tomatoes marry well here as well as do the breadcrumbs with the spinach. Could leave out and still be good. Served draped over roasted cod, which was delicious.

I used less than the amount of spinach called for (cooking for two), but the full amount of the other ingredients. More work than some other spinach recipes, but definitely worth a try. Watch out when cooking the breadcrumbs, they can easily burn! P.S. I didn't burn them, but it was a close call.
