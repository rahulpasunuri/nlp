Really tasty and better than other granola recipes on this website. Used a little more cinnamon and brown sugar because I like those flavors. Do not omit the ginger or salt - gives good flavor. You must watch this - 40 min is way too long for this. Mine was done between 25-30 min. Used assorted nuts and a bit of sweetened coconut since I didn't have the unsweetened. Very good.

This is the quintessential "go to" recipe in my mind. VERY tasty, classic, and easy to personalize! fantastic.

So easy! I tried this for the first time and ended up having to substitute half of the honey with maple syrup as we ran out of honey. I also didn't feel like running to the store just for unsweetened coconut so just used the sweetened variety I had on hand and cut out the brown sugar completely. I was a bit worried that I accidentally put too much salt in, but it mellowed once it was baked. It did take the full 40 minutes in my oven (stirring every 10 minutes and alternating racks for the two cookie sheets). I would not bother with the parchment paper the next time,

Turned out great. Made to recipe but used walnuts and almonds instead of pecans, added chia seeds, flax and sunflower seeds.

Delicious! Very economically considering the price of granola in the store. I wish they had included the nutritional data.

I love this recipe, it is so easy and delicious, don't skip the ginger. I do increase it to 1 tsp of cinnamon, and use maple syrup instead of honey. I also substitute sliced almonds for the pecans because they are cheaper. I use dried apples or raisins or mixed tropical fruit, but any dried fruit that you like would do.

I like the cinnamon flavor of this simple granola. Next time I will cut down on the brown sugar.

So sad... I doubled the recipe, and cooked at 300 as suggested, but it burned after only 15 minutes! (And yes, I took it out and stirred at 10.) Disappointing...

This granola turned out great! I used brown rice syrup instead of honey because I had bought it to try Molly's other recipe on Orangette. I used this recipe and added some sesame seeds, used the large flaked coconut from Bob's Red Mill, and used the brown rice syrup instead of honey and it was delicious. I added some jumbo raisin medley from TJ and chopped dried apples, and also replaced some of the pecans with slivered almonds.

Yep, Everyday is about right. Last night my 4-year old going to bed says, "Mom, can you make me granola for breakfast?" I do make this recipe about once a week and find it quite yummy by all standards. Recently I've been replacing the honey with maple syrup or agave nectar. The agave is sweeter than honey or sugar, so I use less. Since that makes the mix a bit dry, I add a slightly beaten egg white (weird, I know, but you have to try it) which besides adding protein also keep the granola crunchy when you add milk to it. Also usually throw in flaxseed, about 1/2 cup per recipe. Rather than mix fruit into a whole batch, I usually mix it in as I serve it so I can change based on what's available, using up my fresh fruit first. Have to admit my fav combo is dark chocolate chips with crystallized ginger, but dried cherries and almonds are a close second.

I make this recipe all the time! I omit the vegetable oil and shredded coconut and add 1/4 cup of coconut butter in place of both. I purchase the coconut butter at my favorite health food store in their bulk section. I smoosh the coconut butter between my fingers to make small pebble-like balls

Everyone who tastes this loves it! I usually double the nuts and sometimes skip the fruit.

Rating: 3
Tastes really good, but I think the brown sugar should be mixed in with the honey/oil mixture because it clumps and is hard to incorporate into the oat mixture. Also, I think 1/3 cup honey is too much. I used less than 1/4 cup and it's plenty sweet enought.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious!! The first time I made it, I added some orange zest to the oil-honey mixture in the pan, and it added wonderful flavor. The second time I made it, I added a splash of almond flavoring in there (I made cherry almond without the coconut). They both came out fantastic. I made a batch and gave it to some friends for Christmas, and it was gone within a few days. Very, very good! It is delicious to munch on plain, you don't even need yogurt or milk (though they are nice too).

It is a great recipe, but it didn't clump all that well. For the dried fruit, I bought a bag of Sun Maid fruitbits, which worked well. It goes well with plain or vanilla yogurt. You can even try it over plain ice cream.

Rating: 3
This was a good base granola. I wish it clumped more...I will have to tinker with the recipe over time. I gave it 3 forks because it didn't blow my socks off, as it seems to have with everyone else. I cooked it 35 minutes...I will reduce the time to 30 so it is less dark. That may raise the rating. I made two batches back to back, and both were the same.

This granola was really really good. It made my house smell heavenly. I followed the directions exactly and used dried cranberries and mango. Great as a snack or over plain yogurt. I might consider using less sugar next time.

Awesome and so healthy. Followed directions but added organic flax seed (1/3 to 1/2 cup). Have also made it with various nuts (walnuts, slivered almonds, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower). I make this at least once a month. Also a great gift!

For better results, reduce baking time to 30 minutes. Mix real maple syrup with honey to equal 1/3 cup. Add fresh or dried fruit just before serving.

Really, I would give this 3-1/2 stars if I could. The recipe is fast and easy and made my house smell wonderful. It's really delicious topped with yogurt and fresh fruit. I doubled the recipe as my boyfriend eats about a box of cereal every two days, and I wanted to make sure there was enough for me. I didn't want it to be too sweet so I doubled everything except the sugar and the honey. I only used 2 -1/2 tablespoons of sugar, and used about 3/4 of the recommended honey. It was still sweet enough without the added sweeteners.

Rating: 4
Delicious! This is a great basic granola recipe. I would recommend watching your batch as it bakes - the granola can go from nice and toasty to almost burnt in a matter of minutes. I used maple syrup in lieu of honey in my latest batch, and it worked perfectly. Use any combination of fruit/nuts that you prefer - I used tart cherries, cranberries, peanuts, and cashews (what I had on hand), and it was perfect.

I think I've made this 10 times since the June Bon Appetit came out and am constantly asked to make "my secret recipe"for friends and relatives. My tips are to at least double it and use the cooking time as a guideline. I've made it in 3 different ovens and the total cooking time varies a lot. The key to make it delicious is to toast it until it's a dark gold, almost amber color as the original article stated. Don't under toast it. If you do that, just follow the recipe for proportions and make as many nut/dried fruit combinations as you want. Delicious!

Delicious with or without (soy) milk. I used dried tart cherries and apricots, the colorw as very nice.

This was my first try to make granola, glad I did, we love it! I left out the coconut (don't like it), added unsalted almonds along with the called for pecans. We love the toasted flavor. We also eliminate the dried fruit as we use yogurt and fresh fruit with it. A definite keeper!

This is my new go to granola recipe. I have tried many recipes in the past, and this is the best. I too like it with fruit and thick greek yogurt. Mmmm....comfort food.

Rating: 4
P.S. Dried fruit is a combination of black mission figs, tart cherries and blueberries. Next time I'll try maple syrup instead of honey. Sounds good!

Rating: 4
I love this with thick Greek yogurt, but I did make a few changes. I prefer almonds, so I subbed those. Also added vanilla and almond extract. Don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I cut down on the brown sugar. Omitted the ginger, as I'm not a fan.

For anyone who's interested, I always take Deborah Madison direction in Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone that the oil can be eliminated and I did eliminate the oil with excellent results. Followed the rest of the recipe except doubling the ginger suited me. We are granola snobs...always have home made granola on hand and this is my new favorite!

Delicious. Some suggestions: Cook at 250 for 1 1/2 hours. No need to stir at all. Comes out great. Also no need for the parchment paper. Can substitute maple syrup for honey. No need to heat and stir. Just pour on. For a little crunch add 1/2 c.buckwheat (from the health food store...not kasha). Really good for you. Here's my variation: 2 1/2 c. oats, 1/2 c. buckwheat, 1 c. rolled rye flakes, 1 c. unsweetened coconut(health food store), 2 c. nuts (slivered almonds, chopped raw cashews, chopped pecans), 1/4 c. maple syrup, 1/4 c. organic virgin coconut oil, salt, ginger, cinnamon optional, mix all, spread on 2 baking sheets, bake for 1 1/2 hrs. at 250 without stirring.

Never made granola before but will make this recipe again and again. It's really delicious! Used sweetened coconut (couldn't find unsweetened) so cut back on the brown sugar to 2 T. Also added a "skosh" more pecans (I love nuts!) than called for and hydrated the dried cranberries I used (hot water to plump them up and then well drained), but otherwise followed the ingredients and preparation to the letter. So easy and so good!

It's quite good and very easy to improvise, exchanging the various nuts, spices, and fruits depending on your mood and what's available in the pantry. I'm dying to try it with dark chocolate chunks, as well. It makes for a great cereal in the morning.

Fabulous! I hadn't found a granola recipe that I wanted to try until now. Made it with my 6 1/2 yr old granddaughter today; it was delicious even before it was cooked. I used maple syrup instead of honey; slivered almonds and pecans; a mixture of cherries, blueberries, cranberries and some mango; no coconut on hand so I left that out. If I had more oats on hand I'd have made another batch. As someone suggested I added some vanilla extract, about 1/2 tsp. Made this way it was a bit sweet so next time I'll cut back the brown sugar by 1 tablespoon. So many different ways to make this with a variety of different additions and subtractions. Definitely will make this again, maybe tomorrow!

This was my 1st time making homemade granola and it was EXCELLENT. I made one addition by adding one cup unsalted pumpkin seeds. I made it when we were at our condo in Maine for hiking/breakfast/with yogurt/snacking. Single batch didn't even last the week. Made a double batch today and used dried blueberries with craisins. Also tastes great before it hits the oven! This has become a new staple for my home.

If you eat granola, MAKE THIS! This was my first try at homemade granola, and I'm never going to back to the box again! I made this recipe exactly as is, except I ommitted coconut. It was perfectly crunchy and flavorful without it. I used dried cranberries and it was awesome. It's a great basic recipe and I'm really excited to experiment a bit more with vanilla, maple syrup, different fruits, pumpkin seeds, maybe adding wheat germ or something. I made a double batch, and after 5 days of breakfast for two it's gone. I plan to make a double batch each weekend. Makes the house smell wonderful!

This receipe is simply terrific - cooked it immediately. I doubled the ingredients to have a larger amount and less work. (:-)) What fun to eat this every morning instead of bread. Using less sugar is a good idea since the dried fruit is already a sweetener. I have got one problem with this receipe: I have been following the bloodtype diet for years now: COCONUT is on the avoid list for O's. -How to replace it? -

A few years ago a friend brought me homemade granola for Christmas - yum! I quickly began making my own again, & this recipe is very similar. I also used coconut oil (I didn't heat it, just put on several spoonfuls), agave nectar or honey & usually local hazelnuts. The flaked coconut adds great soluable fiber, & ginger would add nice flavor. I also tend to go lighter on sweetening. Since going Gluten Free last summer, I have stopped making granola - yes, GF oats are available (farmed & milled seperately) but oats are a 'eat rarely' food for folks with Gluten sensitivity. I tend to cook up several seeds/grains - millet, buckwheat, quinoa; with a Tbsp of teff & of amaranth; it would be fun to add these seasonings & coconut flakes!

This recipe is wonderful as is and is also a great base recipe for improvising with your own fruit, nut, etc. preferences. I agree with alipali, being disappointed with reviewers who give low ratings based on calorie count. Especially when their comments are so off base. A 1/2 cup serving (standard) of this granola with 1 c. fat-free yogurt or milk makes for about a 400 calorie (depending on the fruits and nuts used) breakfast rich in fiber & many essential nutrients. This is well within calorie intake guidelines even for sedentary women. To "A cook on 6/1" - please refrain from issuing negative reviews based on your personal perceptions of how healthy a dish is. A healthy diet allows for all foods in moderation. If we all based our reviews on calorie count, there would be no 4-fork dessert recipes on this site - that would be disappointing indeed!

This is a good granola recipe. It was a little too sweet for me though. Next time I would cut the brown sugar down to 1 T. The ginger added a nice twist to the traditional cinnamon only.

I've never made my own granola, but this was delicious! I used coconut oil and a dried fruit combo of peaches/nectarines/apricots/raisins. It wasn't as sweet as I expected (I'm used to packaged granola), but I got used to it quickly. This is the perfect snack to have at my office when I get hungry. As a side note, this isn't that calorically dense, and it is very healthy. It's only about 300 calories per 1/2 cup serving (which is quite filling), and those calories are made up of complex carbs, protein and healthy fats. Make sure to use raw nuts without added salt/oil, and dried fruit without added sugar or oil to avoid adding unnecessary empty calories (I bought mine at the farmer's market, but a health food store should have the good stuff). Sorry for the nutrition lecture, but it bugs me when people give low ratings to delicious recipes based solely on their caloric content. Try this! It's tasty and healthy!

I just made this exactly as the recipe states, and it is fabulous! Boring?! Not with cinnamon and ginger. And, I agree with the previous post that the ginger just adds a little something. I've added dried cranberries as my dried fruit, but I can imagine it with something tropical for the summer like papaya or pineapple, pears for the fall, and dates and raisins for the winter. An all around go-to recipe for good granola.

I personally thought it was boring. I've made other granola recipes I've liked a lot more and will go back to using those. Perhaps it needed some vanilla or something.

Love this recipe. I've made other granola recipes and never repeated them. This one? I made it one day -- it was gone by the next -- and my family requested another batch, so I made it again right away. A few alterations: no ginger, and I didn't stir it when it came out of the oven -- left it so it would have more "clumps." Yum. Delicious with vanilla yogurt for breakfast.

Rating: 4
I used the exact ingredients and I really like this recipe. (I think the ginger gives it a very nice, subtle flavor, not overpowering at all.) I kept mine in a little longer because I like it on the darker side, and only stirred once. And to A Cook From Seattle, if you want it to "clump" so you can eat handfuls as a snack, just leave it on the counter for a bit after you take it out of the oven. Mine hardened so I could break it into pieces.

I thought this was really good - not too sweet and not a lot of fat. I left out the coconut, the ginger, and the cinnamon - personal preference. I also used chopped almonds instead of pecans - very yummy. I took it out at 35 minutes and probably should have taken it out at 30 because it got a little too brown for my taste. But a very good recipe to use as a basis for variations.

I made this recipe without the coconut and ginger and it was pretty good. It is an easy though sweeter version of granola than I normally make. (I regularly make King Arthur Flour's Crunchy Granola with lots of nuts and fruit recipe which is excellent.) Next time I try this, I will only use 2 T of brown sugar. I like the cinnamon flavor of this recipe.

perfect taste, texture, roasted nut flavor - just how granola should taste. Now I only need to figure out how to make it clump a little so it is easier to eat by the handful.
