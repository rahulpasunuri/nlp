This is a winner, as it can be put together ahead of time, refrigerated, and then baked. Any kind of cheese works. I used 2 (2 1/4 oz) cans sliced olives instead of the kalamata.

Everyone seemed to enjoy this recipe but I found it lacking a bit of something... one other review suggested artichokes and I think I will try that next time. I liked it and and would make it again as it is an interesting alternative side dish.

Nice easy recipe for a simple supper on a day we had a hearty lunch. As suggested, I added artichoke hearts.Not sure about the proportions, as I cut it down for two-three servings. This and a green salad made for a lovely meal.

AWESOME. A bit more work than I anticipated but definitely worth it. Very nice to look at too!! A definite do-over -- good for company.

This is a great, simple recipe. However, I did not like the celery at all. I did use the extra broth and used Parmesan on top instead of more mozzarella. I think I'll add spinach next time instead of the celery.

This is my go-to side for Christmas- I sub chopped red and green peppers for 1 c of the celery. Very Festive. Make the day before and just pop in the oven to serve with the beef tenderloin on Christmas eve. Yum.

Really good. I added artichoke hearts, I think this really added something special. It is wonderful for a dinner party- make ahead of time and cooks while you visit.

I've used this recipe many times. Sometimes I will substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth when I know some of my guests will be vegetarian. It is a great recipe for a large group and always gets many compliments. I could not find my Dec. 1990 issue of gourmet and needed this recipe for tonight. I am thrilled that I was able to print it off of this site.

Thanks to the comments from other cooks, I increased the tomatoes (undrained) and used 2 cups of chicken broth. I also used smoked mozarella as that was what I had on hand. It was very tasty -- reminded me of a putantesca sauce. I would definitely make it again.

I rate this 4 stars with the changes I made to the recipe...everybody who has tasted it has loved it. I added 2 cups chicken broth, and used a 28 oz and 14 oz can plum tomatoes WITH the juice. I also used BASKET CHEESE in place of the mozzarella and added about 3 tblsp fresh choppped parsley. I also used Kalamata olives both times...they add a little kick, and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Yummy!

I thought that this recipe was really nothing special. Once finished it tasted pretty much like cayenne pepper and orzo, and I wouldn't bother to make it again, but it was okay.

I too used just a teaspoon of cayenne...it was perfect...a hit with my dinner guests. It's an easy recipe and very colorful.

This was a pretty good dish although it was a bit heavy in the cheese department, I'd skip the cheese on top next time. The 1/4 cup of ceyanne has got to be a type-o! It would be unbearable! I put in a teaspoon and that was plenty! I served this with garlic bread and a green salad with apple cider vinaigrette.

My husband cooked this using 1 teaspoon of cayenne for 1 and a half recipes. It was still pretty spicy. Probably 1/2 teaspoon for one recipe would work fine. I think 1/4 cup would produce an inedible dish.

Really yummy, but watch that cayenne! I used the recommended quarter cup and it was way too spicy. Even cutting it with another cup of plain orzo had no effect on the spiciness.

I have made this dish a few times and love it.
