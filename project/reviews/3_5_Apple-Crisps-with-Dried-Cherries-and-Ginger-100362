Great last minute dessert. The ginger adds a nice twist on traditional crisp. I followed earlier review of halving recipe and baking in an 8 X 8 pan.

Loved this!! Made changes based on combining hints from the lovely reviews. 1. I used 9x12 pan. 2. pecan not almonds 3. golden delicious apples, with peel on and chunks not slices for more mouth feel 4. Ranier sweet dried cherries 5. less sugar 6. convection oven for crisp topping 7. two dashes of nutmeg 8. after putting it together, I added a 1/3 cup of white wine by pouring along the side of the pan so as to not splash the topping. This will be my fall go-to dinner party dessert. I made it early in the afternoon, and warmed it in the oven before serving it with homemade Baileys icecream.

Very yummy! I halved the recipe and made it in a 8x8 baking pan instead of individual ramekins. Dried cherries are one of my favorite foods and they go very well in this dish. The crystalized ginger really makes the flavor fantastic, so don't skip it. I will definitely make this again!

Awesome! Made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews-cooked the crisps while we ate and it came out perfectly.

This is an excellent recipe, one I have used several times, to raves from guests. I recommend 1) chopped pecans instead of almonds 2) a mix of apples such as Black Twig, Winesap, Jonahgold, and other varieties which, when combined, give a more interesting flavor and texture 3) blend together the filling sugar, flour and cinnamon before tossing it with the sliced apples; 4)make sure you let the crisp cook until the syrupy filling starts bubbling up through spots in the topping. You will have a heavenly blend of crispy top and tender filling. 5) If you bake in a metal pan, remove the leftovers to glass. The acidity of the apples will pick up the metallic flavor if allowed to stand. 6) Don't refrigerate the leftovers, if there is any. They won't be around for long (a favorite breakfast with yogurt) and the top gets soggy in the fridge.

This is a really simple and tasty recipe. I left out the crystallized ginger and just made one large crisp instead of individual ones. We ate it with vanilla ice cream and it was really good.

This crisp had a good combination of flavors; the tart cherries were a nice addition, and the ginger in the topping was also good. I made it in a 9x13 pan and baked it for just over 50 minutes. Following some of the suggestions from others, I started with only about 2/3 of the topping on the crisp and added the final 1/3 after about 30 minutes. This worked to produce a fairly crisp top that was brown but not burnt, though it might have been just as good if I'd put the whole amount of topping on. I'd make it again, but I might reduce the amount of sugar that was used with the apples and cherries, as the filling was almost too sweet.

YUM! We made a few changes and will most certainly make this again. We made 1 1/2 times the topping and used walnuts instead of almonds and Penzey's Apple Pie spice and added the ginger to the filling. Other additions to the filling: vanilla, brandy, and a blueberry, cranberry, cherry mix of dried fruit. We also used the apple pie spice in place of just cinnamon. Delicious.

Very good, pretty, tasty, but not the best crisp I've ever made. I reduced the ginger by one half, since too much can taste medicinal, substituted pecans for almonds, mixed grannies and braeburn apples in a 13X9 baking dish, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.

I love apple crisp, so I searched and searched for the perfect recipe. I must have tried a couple of dozen apple crisp recipes, but when I tried this one, the search was over. I do make a few small changes. I omit the almonds altogether, use only half the amount of crystallized ginger, and substitute dried Bing cherries for the dried tart cherries. I like Golden delicious apples for baking, so that is what I use, but that is just a personal preference. With those slight adjustments, this recipe is my idea of apple crisp heaven.

I love this recipe and have made it more than once - the ginger is the key - I used pecans instead of almonds and it was great!

Too sweet. Topping too dry and burnt!

Rating: 1
This was too sweet and the topping burned because the temp was too high, the baking time too long, and there wasn't enough butter in the topping

Rating: 2
I use golden delicious apples (about 1 apple per serving), don't peel them and the crisp still turns out great. I also decrease the sugar in both the topping and the filling due to the use of sweeter apples and Craisins instead of tart cherries. I serve it hot and 'a la mode' to rave reviews!

Excellent, made a little dish for myself to check out before serving to the crowd at a dinner party tonight! I used cranberries and chopped the ginger small. Do not leave it out, it really makes this recipe. Also don't be afraid to pack the dish high with the apples and crisp, it really shrinks down in baking. Unlike some of the others, I do not melt the butter, just leave it out to soften then rub it together with the other ingrediants. It turned out crispy on top, but I have a convection oven so that might help. TRY IT!

Really tasty and easy to make. Great way to use up apples. I substituted fresh cranberries for the cherries since cranberries are in season right now. Good sweet & tart taste!

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. Great play of sour against sweet, soft against crunchy. Almost everyone takes seconds so it serves 8 to 9 at the most rather than 12. One guest had severe nut allergies so I omitted the almonds and used raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas) which baked up good and crunchy. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested melting the butter before adding it to the topping mixture -- worked like a charm to produce a really crunchy topping.

I made this last night as a quick but tasty fall dessert. Like the reviewer before me I (mostly) halved the recipe to make in a 9x9. I actually made more than half of the topping (approx. 3/4), because that's my favourite part. It was very, very tasty. The dried cherries were perfect. As for keeping the top crisp, no need to reserve some and add part way through baking. The key to making a crisp crisp is melted butter. When making the topping, melt the butter before adding and then proceed as directed. My mother spent a long time experimenting with this and found that melted butter was the difference between crumble and crisp!

I loved this crisp. I made half of the recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan for about 45 min.I substituted walnuts in the topping and used braeburn apples. The cherries were great but this would be just as tasty without. I chopped the ginger into small pieces to get small bursts of ginger flavor. As another reviewer mentioned if you reserve half of the topping and sprinkle it on halfway through baking it stay crunchy. That is a good tip for most any streusel topped recipe.

I made this at Thanksgiving and it was excellent. After reading some of the reviews here, I added a little extra lemon juice and didn't use as much topping, but next time I will probably do the recipe as it is. The cherries I used were very tart and I think it the sugar really helped. Maybe if the cherries you use aren't the tart ones or if you use cranberries or something else instead it would be sweeter. I also did this in a 9x13 dish and it came out perfect. I also chopped my ginger very fine and did not think it had too strong of a ginger taste. The ginger really contributed to the taste of the dessert and made it a little different. Loved it and plan to make it again.

Made this tonight for Thanksgiving it was the perfect complementary end to a cider-brined turkey. Excellent and very easy to make, especially since the topping can be made ahead. I love crystallized ginger, I won't cut as small next time because I couldn't taste it. Used tart Montmorency cherries so the sugar in the recipe was perfect to balance the tartness in the cherries. Did as one cook suggested, put 1/2 the topping on, then the other 1/2 halfway through baking....it was awesome, had a really nice crunch and texture....perfect with vanilla ice cream. Will definitely have this again.

We baked and tested four different crisp recipes in order to serve the best apple crisp at a party for 50. This one won by a landslide. You can cut back the sugar and finely chop the crystallized ginger, use cherries or cranberries - it's delicious and easy to make.

This is an excellent dessert - I have made it many times. This recipe alone is great reason to go apple picking in the fall. I always omit the nuts and bake the 12 servings in ovenproof stoneware cereal bowls (since I don't have 12 ramekins).

This was quick, and the ability to make topping ahead was very useful. It had a wonderful golden colour, and the crisp top was wonderful. Unlike most boring crisp recipes.

Good apple crisp recipe. SUGGESTION: To keep the topping from getting soggy, put only 1/2 the topping on and then half way thru the cooking time put the other 1/2 on. That way you still get a little crunch. It's the little suggestions that make all the difference. Also, I doubled the topping.

This is THE dessert to serve for those fussy eaters among your family and friends who will never try anything new. Add the ginger or don't add the ginger; change the almonds to pecans or skip the nuts altogether; substitute dried cranberries for the cherries; serve it in individual ramekins or a 13X9" glass pan. It doesn't matter what you do to this recipe because it always works. If your crabby mother-in-law is coming to dinner for Thanksgiving or Christmas, then please do yourself a favor and put away the ingredients for pumpkin mousse tart or bouche-de-Noel. Put this together the night before your celebration and then stick it in the oven just before you sit down to dinner. Next year your husband's brother is stuck with your in-laws and you can be more ambitious.

This was really good! I made it in a 13x9 pan, and cut back on the sugar. I used dried cranberries instead of cherries, and left out the nuts in the topping (one member of family doesn't like nuts). Make sure you cut apples thickly, or they turn into applesauce!

I made this for co-workers, they were enthusiastic in both their praise & their eating. I added a cup of fresh raspberries also & increased the sugar by 1/4 cup. It was an exciting variation on the traditional apple crisp.

This was excellent!! Made it in a 9x13 pan, too fussy the other way. Next time I will try the cranberries as dried cherries are way too expensive in this neck of the woods. A keeper!!

I made this recipe for my family for Thanksgiving. It was excellent, especially with vanilla ice cream. In response to a previous review, I didn't find the ginger overpowering, but then again I really like crystallized ginger.

Rating: 3
Delicious but the ginger was a little overpowering. Maybe I did not chop the ginger small enough. Next time I will leave out the ginger or use ground ginger in the topping.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it 3 times, one with the cherries & twice with cranberries. We prefer the cranberries. To prevent the Almonds from burning, I lay a piece of foil over the dish half way through the cooking time. I'll be making this again & again. Enjoyed the ginger, too!

I made this last night and everyone raved. I used tart dried cherries, and I think they really added to the flavor (and color). Couldn't find Pippin so used Granny Smiths - cut them on the thick side and they held up well. Did add a bit more lemon juice than called for and was glad I did. Will definitely make it again!

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe! I made it for 8 dinner guests and they all raved. Also, I found it very easy to make; I made the topping ahead of time and I also combined the other ingredients in a bowl beforehand (less the apples). I baked the crisps in shallow quiche dishes which made for a lovely presentation. Topped with Ciao Bella vanilla, it was a winner.

This dessert was a hit. I took the advice of other and substituted cherries for dried cranberries and cut the sugar for the most scrumptious closer to delicious Thanksgiving meal. A definate addition to every holiday spread.

This is a great dessert, very attractive too. After reading the previous reviews, i cut back on the sugar, and was glad that I did. It is quite sweet. I also used dried cranberries instead of the cherries. That helped with the sweetness, and gave a nice sweet/sour kick. Will do again!

I made this last night and everyone loved it. I thought it was good but just too sweet, even though I doubled the lemon juice and reduced the sugar. The cherries were too much, a bit cloying. Next time I may substitute fresh, frozen or dried cranberries and add a few spices beyond cinnamon.

I have made this recipe three times in 10 days - it's addictive! My family goes wild over it, as does the company to whom I've served it. It is a perfect balance of tart and sweet, and the topping is the best "crisp" topping I've ever come across.

I have made this twice, first time it was too sweet, 2nd time less sugar and more apples. It is heavenly. Everyone raved!!

Rating: 4
One of my all-time favorite dessert recipes! The combination of apples, cherries and ginger is unusual and delicious. A few cautions: I had to reduce the baking time because (I think) I sliced the apples too thin, and with the cherries, the dessert becomes too sweet, so I also cut down the sugar.

I made this recipe today in a corning ware baking dish instead of using souffle dishes..I used dried bing cherries instead of tart ones, I used whole almonds instead of chopping them and I added cinnamon sticks as a last topping to the dish before I put it into the oven and a bit more melted margarine to the topping so the almonds wouldn't burn..and voila..55 minutes later it was a delictable wonderful topping to our Thanksgiving Feast..and it was enjoyed by everyone! There were NO leftovers..this one goes quick!

I made this fabulous dessert last Thanksgiving, expecting left overs, but there weren't any. The combination of the cherries and ginger warm from the oven was perfect. Even the guests who do not care for super sweet things enjoyed it. It is on the menu again this year!!

I made the recipe without the ginger. I didn't think that my family would like it. great taste but be careful that you don't burn the almonds.
