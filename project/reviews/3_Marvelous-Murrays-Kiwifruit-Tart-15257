This dessert is light and refreshing. I made it one night when entertaining and my guests loved it! A great dessert.

I have made this confection for a variety of people, and all have found the kiwifruit tart marvelous and refreshing. I can't think of a meal that the kiwifruit tart would not conclude with finesse.
