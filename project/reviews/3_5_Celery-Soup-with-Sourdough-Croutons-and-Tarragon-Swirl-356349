I agree with everyone else - DO NOT skip the croutons and the tarragon swirl. Also give it a decent bit of seasoning.

I thought this was a simple and delicious recipe. I would really only make it if I were trying to use up a lot of celery (which is in fact what I was trying to do) so I'm half-and-half on whether I would make it again. That said, it was light yet filling and was very refreshing. I recommend being liberal with the salt and black pepper. It would also be nice with more complex spices. It seems like a good recipe to play around with--for my part, I added fresh ground nutmeg and thought it was really nice.

I wasn't crazy about the texture of this soup-- pureeing it didn't make it creamy enough to qualify as "velvety," and it wasn't thick enough to qualify as "rustic." I upped the potatoes to thicken it a bit more, but otherwise followed the recipe. I won't make this again.

LOVED IT!

Made this for the family. Only change was I added a leek with the scallions because I had one sitting in the fridge. Very nice soup with a fresh celery flavor - very easy too. Don't skip the croutons, they make the dish!

We've just had this soup for dinner tonight, and it was very good. The only thing I can't figure out is why no salt is called for in the ingredient list. After I pureed it, I added at least a teaspoon, probably more like two, plus a little pepper and a few drops of lemon juice. Seasoning is everything if you want to avoid bland soup. Oh, and the croutons are lovely too, I toasted mine first since my bread was very fresh.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I used Yukon gold potatoes instead and it gave the soup a rich flavor. A cozy meal for a rainy day!

Don't skip the tarragon swirl; it elevates the soup from ho-hum to dinner-party worthy.

I was inspired by this recipe but went a slightly different route. It turned out fantastic! {2 heads of celery, 1 celery root, 1 yellow onion, 3 green onions, 1 teaspoon celery seed, veggie broth to cover, 1/4 cup yogurt (stirred in at the end), sprinkled with gorgonzola & served with rye toast} Give it a try.

I love this recipe because it is easy and I am almost guaranteed to have the ingredients at home already. No need to run to the store! On that note, because of what I had, I made a few (major) changes. I left out the celery seed, used white onion instead of green onion, and didn't stir in whipping cream. Also, one MAJOR change that I'm glad I did: I used sweet potatoes and carrots instead of regular potatoes. Ok, so maybe I totally changed the recipe, but do this and it will taste wonderful! And it keeps well in the freezer.

I shouldn't be reviewing this, as I've not made the recipe as written. Wouldn't celery root ( aka celeraic) be a better substitute for the potatoes? The other question I have is whether this might be better pressed through a sieve, and garnished with the chopped green parts of the green onions? When I test this recipe with modifications, I'll let you know how it went

This was rather nice. I didn't include the green onions and I used dried tarragon instead of fresh. Celery has a tendency to be a little bitter so I would add an extra potato next time.

The recipe didn't blow me away, but it was different. The croutons helped make the dish complete. It helps to be a bit creative add extra spices, such as garlic, lemon juice or something with a little punch to it.

Found the texture of this soup kind of slimy-gloppy. I wonder if using a russet (starchy) potato instead of a white-skinned (waxy) potato would correct that flaw. The flavor of the soup itself was bland, could have used more celery flavor (maybe more celery seed?). However, the tarragon yogurt and sourdough crouton garnishes rescued the dish. If I made it again, I'd recommend doubling or tripling the amounts of the garnishes.

I found this ridiculously bland, and I even used homemade chicken stock as well as full fat sour cream instead of the yogurt. The low-calorie nature of the recipe was not the problem--texture was nice and creamy while not too heavy. The problem was that it has no bright or strong flavors in it, nor any acidity. Perhaps some lowfat buttermilk or more yogurt stirred in would help, extra celery seed, and some dill if you like dill. I won't be expending any effort trying to save this one, though. Too many delicious low-calorie soups exist to bother.

wow, so yummy. I made my coutons with sourdough toasted and added a little asiago cheese. The soup is wonderful and taste so rich even without the fat. My family really enjoyed it.

I love to make and to eat soup. This one is the most bland, insipid and tasteless (redundant, I know!) one that I've ever made or eaten.

Simple and delicious. I did not have the amount of green onions called for so used half green onions and shallots. Will definitely make again.

something about making and eating this soup made me feel very french. so few ingredients yielded a lovely, simple, unfussy flavor. i used a bagel to make the croutons and toasted them instead of frying. also, using an immersion blender (best kitchen tool ever!) makes pureeing the soup a thousand times easier...

We loved this soup. It was fast and easy and the leftovers are great the next day. We did run the soup through a strainer to get that "baby food" consistancy a little smoother and used some lemon and honey in the yougurt with the tarragon and it was perfect. We also used some garlic salt on thr croutons - I'll be eating them for days!

So easy to make and a really subtle, sophisticated flavor - my guests went nuts for this, I will be making this a lot in the future.

This is so much better than it sounds! I added some white wine...Mmmmm! This will become a staple in my home!

This is a delicious soup. Two stores were out of tarragon so I used rosemary and fennel pollen instead, and substituted creme fraiche for yogurt. Celery is such an underrated star of the show. YUM! The croutons are crazy good.
