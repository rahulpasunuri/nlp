Made this for a party and it was a simple and elegant springtime hors d'oeuvre. Paired on platters with a second type of bruschetta, it looked great.

Slow to post my review of this great little crostini - I made it last August. We loved it and with the make ahead steps, it's a last minute time saver. It's also very good served with a Sauvignon Blanc wine.
