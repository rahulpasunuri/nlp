The proportions for the ingredients seem off. With 2# of beef the instructions say to make 12 meatballs. However, I was able to make twice that. When grilling, the meatballs spread and fell apart, which suggests that there was not enough binder. Flavor was ok, but definitely needs some tweaking. The pesto, on the other hand, was excellent.
