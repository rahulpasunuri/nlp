Excllent dark fruitcake. Instead of the glaceed fruit I used dried pineapple and apricots; cooked fruit and left it for 2 days before baking the cake. Can't think of anything that would make it better.

This is the best dark fruitcake recipe I have ever made. It cannot be compared to commercial fruitcakes as it is a REAL fruitcake! Absolutely fabulous and coveted by family members!

Excellent! Very heavy but gets better with time. The Lyle's Golden Syrup reminded me of my childhood when my dad would get some on his trips to Belize.

Actually I have more of a question than a rating. I have never made a fruitcake and dont know much about them. The recipe does not say I should continue to pour rum over the cake for days or weeks on end so whats the story. After I follow the recipe-am I supposed to keep adding more rum?

-- This is an update to my first review on this recipe. I liked this recipe at first, but now after eating it for the past two weeks since Thanksgiving I'm not so fond of it anymore because it is so very heavy and sickly sweet. The dark rum I used has gotten on my nerves too. If I ever make it again I will try the clear rum next time, and may use dried fruit instead of 'candied' fruit to cut down on the sweetness. I just wanted to let everyone know that my opinion about this cake has changed since I first tried it unfortunately.

This came out very well. I candied my own fruits and peel. I used Myers dark rum and I used a La Forme spring form pan. The recipe said you can make it up to 3 weeks ahead. I'm not sure if it must be refrigerated, the recipe didn't say. So I'm refrigerating it till I need it for Thanksgiving just to be safe.

I love fruitcake and have only ever made this one. (I even like the fake red cheeries and green fruit.) I made it for the last three Christmas seasons and have been pleased each time with the results. I would not even try another recipe. Last year I soaked the dried fruits in Cpt Morgan Rum for 3 days and found no difference in taste. I did not have unsalted butter and used salted. I also do not use self rising flour so I added 1/8 tsp baking powder to the 1/3 cup of self rising flour and it worked fine. I make it 6-8 weeks ahead of the first serving and continue fortifying it with Meyers Dark Rum. I keep it packed in 10x sugar during this period covered with a rum soaked white dishcloth and wrapped in tin foil in the fridge. It freezes wonderfully cut into individual serving sizes. If you like fruitcake this one is a pure winner.

Delicious. Also made this fruit cake this year, about 6 weeks ago. Did bit use red cherries either. Much easier than other recipe.

Very good, pretty easy. I used pineapple and apricot for the glaced fruits - trying to avoid the stigma of red cherries in fruitcake. It's delicious. Dense and fruity, not too sweet. I can't wait to see how it is in a few weeks - if it lasts that long!

I made this for my dad who loves fruitcake last Christmas. He loved it when it was freshly made around Christmas time. He saved it all year, adding rum to it every week. He just finished it at the beginning of September and said that the last bite was divine. I am making it for him again this year only I'm starting a few months earlier and will add a little rum to it every week. Definitely search for nice glaceed fruits, it's worth it.

Best fruitcake recipe I have ever made!!! Just for fun I made a second batch of the "fruit mixture" and added a little more rum. At my friends request I now keep this mixture in the refrigerator and use it for ice cream topping!!!
