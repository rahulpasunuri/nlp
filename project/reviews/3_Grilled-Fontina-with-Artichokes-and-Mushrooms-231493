My family has enjoyed these sandwiches many times. I think they are delicious and take only minutes to prepare. That rates high marks in my book!

This was tasty, and easy to prepare, but a little messy to eat.

This really looked like a great combination of ingredients, but I must agree with the other reviewers that it was a bit bland. I had even thrown in some garlic with the mushrooms, but it didn't help. Perhaps sauteeing the mushrooms with some onions would help. The fontina melted nicely, but it was a bit bland; maybe a stonger cheese would help or adding a little blue cheese to the mix?

It's definitely on the bland side. There's not a lot of flavor to the mushrooms or fontina when used together and the marinated artichokes ended up tasting much too vinegar-y. I used thinly sliced portobellas as my mushroom choice. Maybe try a marinated mushroom or stronger cheese??

I had a friend over for a quick lunch while my two year old napped, it was perfect. I used shitake mushrooms for a liitle more flavor. I liked that it was a mild grilled sandwich. It's light and crunchy too!

The fontina melted nicely but it was little bland tasting to me. I think there are better grilled cheese recipes. Maybe use all the same ingredients with a sharp cheddar would be good.

Made this for a luncheon and my guests would not leave!

These were fine, but I didn't think they showed off well what sounded like a great flavor combination. The bread and strong cheese overwhelmed the mushrooms and artichokes. If I ever did this again, I would increase the amount of filling (and add some garlic and parsley) and decrease the amount of cheese and make it openface under the broiler. I might even replace the fontina with a shavings of a harder cheese like asiago and skip the broiler altogether.

I made these last night and they make a wonderful light supper. I served it with roasted cauliflower, but it would also go well with a salad. The Fontina has just the right texture when melted.
