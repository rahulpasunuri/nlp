I make these for my wife, who does not eat gluten. This last time, they were better than the standard pancakes I made for the rest of the family. They were delicious, crispy and hearty, somewhere between a corn muffin and a corn cake. Very simple, but I like simple honest flavors. I fry them in butter and not vegetable oil. Next time, it's jonnycakes for me as wsll! (Confession - I did live for 5 years in Rhode Island, the home of the Jonnycake.)

Follow the recipe exactly, especially the cooking directions, and you'll be pleased. Whenever I've deviated with the ingredients or from the instructions, I've been disappointed. The batter needs to be relatively thin and the pancakes crisp. The corn taste goes so well with maple syrup, don't skimp there-it's worth serving with real maple syrup.

Maybe it was my stone-ground blue cornmeal, maybe it was my skim milk -- whatever it was, I did not love these. They were nearly as thin as potato chips and, unless eaten within seconds of taking them off the pan, they cooled and were somewhat unappealing.
