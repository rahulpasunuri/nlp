I thought this was amazing -- light and refreshing, with a great tang. I used dried Coleman's mustard, which gave it just the right heat. Served it with the cauliflower steak with cauliflower puree and sweet potatoes. Lots of vitamins and colors. My partner loved it!

I found the miso a bit overpowering. I added 1/4 cup lemon juice and would probably cut the miso in half if I were to make it again.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. It is my favorite green bean recipe as it's a nice combination of tangy, spicy and sweet.

I love miso, fresh greenbeans, and all of the other ingredients and so I was anxious to try this recipe. I was disappointed.

Just a note, Japanese hot mustard is the same thing as Chinese hot mustard like you get in the packets with your delivery Chinese food. Crack open a couple packets and you should be good to go!

Delicious -- this was the perfect side dish for a soy-sauce-braised-brisket I made. My husband made the green beans exactly as the directions called for, except we had to use the English mustard because we couldn't find the Japanese hot mustard anywhere, and we halved the recipe.
