I enjoyed these cupcakes. They were exactly what I was looking for; spicy in flavor, light in texture and not too sweet. One note: I substituted butter for shortening.

I substituted the pumpkin as per the suggestion below and it still seemed like something was off. Mine came out bland, I wouldn't recommend.

I substitued 1 cup of 100% pumpkin for the molassass. It turned out great. It gave the cupcakes a very festive color for a autumn snack. The icing was a snap to make also. These "pumpkin" cupcakes were a hit at an office Halloween party!

These turned out very moist nad the frosting is nice, but they tasted like molassas--I couldn't taste any of the spices. I wonder if maybe the 1/2 c. of molassas is a typo . . . All and all, they are good MOLASSAS muffins.
