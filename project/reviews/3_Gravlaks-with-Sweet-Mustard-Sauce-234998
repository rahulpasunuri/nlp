I have been making this recipe for many years and it has always been well received as a gift or served as an appetizer on buttered brown bread topped with a sprig of fresh dill and a couple of small capers. I don't have the recipe for the sweet mustard sauce but if it is very mild it shouldn't hide the wonderful taste of the salmon. Two suggestions - use very fresh wild salmon when available and add a couple of ounces of vodka to the salt mix and use lots of whole fresh dill stems and course freshly ground black pepper.
