To avoid the "wateriness" mentioned by the previous reviewer, I kept the ingredients but changed the method. I sliced the zucchini very thinly using a box grater, then sauted in a combination of peanut and sesame oils in a large hot fry pan,stirring frequently. When the volume had reduced by about half, I added the sesame seeds and coked for about another minute before adding lemon juice and soy sauce. Delicious!

I'd rate this a 2.5. I love sesame oil and I thought it would give a nice coating but seemed on the watery side to me. I would try again but maybe saute in liquid next time.
