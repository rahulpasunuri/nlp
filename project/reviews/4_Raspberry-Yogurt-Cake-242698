A delicious and light cake. I didn't have an orange on hand so I substituted lemon for the orange juice and peel. It would be great for breakfast or brunch. I didn't bother with the glaze, just sprinkled powdered sugar on top. It looked great and tasted even better!

I made this cake for my husband as a Midsummer dessert. It was wonderful! the yogurt makes it very soft and moist. I made it again but with mandarin orange slices--and tomorrow I'm going to try using blackberries. Flavorful yogurt will make this cake even better.

We thought the cake was delicious. The raspberries (I used fresh) gave it a pleasant tartness. Not too sweet. I made a lemon glaze instead of almond. I also used full fat Greek yogurt since that's what we had. Great for a brunch or snack with coffee. I think it might be good with rhubarb rolled in sugar. I baked it for one hour even and it looked lovely when it came out of the bundt pan.

Very humid. would do it again but reduce the amount of yogurt and probably just two eggs. I also reduced the amount of sugar till 1 cup and used honney yogurt instead. I had to leave it longer in the oven so that the humidity would not be so overpowering.

I found this cake really doughy and too moist. I used frozen raspberries--maybe that was wrong?!!

Very moist. I agree with others that almond extract may be overwhelming. I only baked for 35 minutes at 350 and it was done. Let it cool for the full 30 minutes or the cake separates into 2 pieces (sticks to pan). The fruit is tart, so perhaps a bit of sugar with the flour dusting. I didn't use the full 1/2 c of flour (only 1/4 cup). Glaze is not exciting - I think a white chocolate glaze would improve this.

Love it! Like a lot of reviewers I made a few subs based on what I had on hand: Added lemon juice and zest instead of orange, and vanilla extract instead of almond. Lowered the sugar to 1&1/4 cups and only had a 10oz. package of frozen raspberries so I used that, being careful to fold them in coated in flour. This recipe really reminds me of muffins I get at a Heartland Cafe.

A great snack cake. I was looking for something to take for Valentine's Day at my daughter's preschool and adapt it to be dairy-free as she's allergic. Used our favorite vegan spread instead of butter (never would have done that before she came along!) and 3/4 cup plain soy yogurt. Baked in a 13 x 9 pan for ease of serving. Very tasty and moist. For the glaze, I pureed 4- 5 large, thawed strawberries with a cup or two of powdered sugar for a beautiful pink glaze.

The foundation of this recipe is fabulous and allows you to play with the flavours to individual preference. I substituted lemon for orange and vanilla for almond. I also suggest mixing the entire 3 cups of flour into the batter and merely coating the raspberries with a light dusting of flour. Spoon a little cake mix into the pan, drop in some berries and repeat the process until you have the batter and berries evenly distributed. This keeps the berries whole and evenly spread out among the fluffy white cake batter. I also added a little fresh lemon juice to the glaze. Will definitely make this again with whichever seasonal fruits available!

Found the almond flavor to be a bit too strong and the cake a bit too sweet. I'll try vanilla and less sugar next time.

I made this cake today and It is Very good. I followed all the instructions except put a little less sugar and vanilla extract instead of almond. I would make it again.

This is a super easy and forgiving recipe. I had loads of raspberries, so I threw in an extra 6 ounce container. Also, I used vanilla extract instead of Almond, because I didn't feel like buying an entire bottle of Almond extract just for this recipe. The cake was awesome, albeit somewhat moist from the extra raspberries. It lasted less than 24 hours in my house. I will make this cake often (using my changes) during raspberry season.

this was so incredibly dry. I was shocked with the yogurt and all. Needs some fine tuning.

I bake cakes every week that are suitable to eat for breakfast (I have a sweet morning tooth). This is the best one I've made for a long time and the people I've made it for think so as well. One asked me to bake one for his family (which I did) and another couple of people I gave it to "to go" liked it so much they had to text my mobile phone immediately.

My fussy family loved this. Made a second one the day after the first was devoured. Only subs were blueberries for the raspberries, lemon rind for orange. I'm looking forward to trying Albuquerque's yougurt/butter sub. All in all a fuss free, easy cake that seems to please all and holds well.

This cake has fantastic flavor and texture. Very moist and easy to make. I baked mine for an hour and found it was a little too brown, but still great. I added vanilla and lemon juice to the icing which gave it a nice zip.

This was delicious! I made a few minor adjustments: I cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 c., and I subbed in another 1/4 yogurt for 1/4 c. of the butter. I also only had frozen berries, which turned into mush when they thawed, so I just put a layer of berry mush between two layers of batter. It looked quite elegant with the glaze, and was devoured quickly by my guests.

Very easy and delicious. I used Cointreau in the glaze, and I served it with additional fresh raspberries.

I needed a quick and easy cake to take to work, so made this one and it got rave reviews. The texture is similar to a pound cake, but a little more moist. I did not have an orange, so substituted lemon peel and juice instead, and I thought that flavor was great! I did measure the raspberried very generously and would do so again. Keep in mind that this isn't a particularly pretty cake, but what the heck when it tastes so good? I would like to try making it again with a few variations: Replacing the powdered sugar glaze for a cream cheese based glaze, or maybe replacing the lemon flavor with vanilla bean and extract and topping it off with a dark chocolate glaze...
