We made this recipe for a big barbecue using boneless/skinless thighs and pork chops. Everybody loved the chicken...lots of compliments. Made it again using just chicken. This will definitely be a regular in our dinner rotation.

I've been making this ever since I cut the recipe from the magazine in 2004. Agree with previous reviewer, the sauce is habit-forming! I thought it might be too hot for my kids but they loved it too.

Brilliant idea of using soy sauce, cumin and chili garlic sauce for this glaze. I cut the recipe to proportion for my 4 pork chops. I didn't have chili-garlic sauce and replaced it with chili powder and whole garlic cloves that were blended together with other ingredients. We had friends over for dinner and everyone raved about it.

Absolutely delicious!!! This has definitely been a summer favorite in our house. I marinated the chicken in the sauce and then added more at the end of the grill time. The extra sauce is worth having around just for dipping!! You won't be disappointed.

Throwing together this glaze was as easy as falling off a log. We tend not to like sweet bbq, so we lessened the amount of ketchup and oj, and upped the chili-garlic. It was wonderful. Very tangy with a nice spice. We'll be making it again soon.

This was a hit at my house tonight. The sauce was great and to think that it had no honey or sugar was amazing. I will making this many times over. Thanks epicurious!

This was extremely quick and easy, and husband loved the sauce over rice. I would 1/4 recipe for just two.

Exceptional glaze? I used as a marinade. I read the comments and quartered the amount except used more cilantro. Used skinned & defatted thighs & regular legs about two lbs, no pork. Marinated for about two hours, barbequed(smoked)over mesquite then covered with foil and let rest in a low oven. Passed the unused marinade as dipping sauce. Raves! The next day, the cold chicken, dipped in the sauce was habit-forming. I will do this again and again.

This is a quick and delicious marinade. Great for grilling. I've made it a few times and made mistakes twice. Even with the mistakes - just the combo of stuff in any proportion goes well. Feel free to experiment!

I really liked this sauce. It was easy to throw together from things I almost always have on hand. The sweet/spicy combination was very good. I scaled down quite a bit (used 1/2 c each of ketchup and orange juice). Was plenty for 5 thighs, with a lot left over for serving.

I only needed enough for 2 people, so I calculated 1/5 of the sauce ingredients and used 2 chicken thighs and 2 pork chops. Neither the orange nor the cumin were dominant. Not sure if we'll make it again (we're just not huge fans of chicken thighs, but might try it with a bone-in skin-on breast).

Made this for my demonstration cooking partner. She was floored and couldn't stop eating. The remaining sauce and leftover chicken was used the next day at a picknik and went over as well as the night before. Used the previous suggestion of cutting the recipe by 1/2, and it was more than enough. Great flavors with just enough heat, will definately use again.

6+ cups of sauce? This site is notorious for recipes with huge amounts of sauce, but this is really over the top. Cut it in half and you'll have more than enough. I did both the chicken and the pork chops on the BBQ with some mesquite wood chips to add a nice smoky flavor. Very tasty.

This was so good! I made it for company and it was so great! It made a lot and we were able to have it the next night. This is also something that can be made a day ahead. Looking forward to making it again.

Loved this recipe. I love sweet and spicy together. We only grilled pork but the flavors would be great with chicken thighs. Common sense should tell you this, but it makes a ton of sauce. I halved the recipe and we used two nights in a row for the two of us. Next time will quarter.

I served this for Father's Day and it was a huge hit. We only used pork chops instead of pork and chicken.

I just made the sauce and put it on grilled boneless, thick-cut pork chops and served them with the sauce for dipping along with some grilled peaches. It was wonderful. One problem I ran into is I cannot put that much OJ in my food processor without it leaking everywhere, oops. So I just whisked it all together in a bowl with chopped parsley (I did not have cilantro on hand). It was quick, easy and delicious. I have more of the sauce left & I am going to grill some chicken to finish it up. It has a nice balanc of hot and sweet. I will make this often.
