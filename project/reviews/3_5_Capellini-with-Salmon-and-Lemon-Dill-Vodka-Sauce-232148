I made a lower-fat, higher-protein version and it turned out very good, IMHO . I cut the EVOO in half and used non-fat Greek yogurt and skim milk instead of heavy cream. Word of caution, the yogurt and milk must be at room temp or higher before you mix it in with the broth to avoid curdling. Before I mixed the 2 together, I strained the broth, reserved the solids and then mixed the yogurt, skim milk and broth using a Braun hand mixer. I returned the mixture to the pan, added the solids and continued to reduce. I also seared the salmon on the grill briefly, after spraying it with EVOO, lemon juice and S&P. Will definitely add this to our Sunday pasta night list

Have made this twice now. The first time I tried to do a quick version by only using 2 cups of broth so I wouldn't have to reduce as long. Turned out OK, but a little bland. The 2nd time I used the full 3 cups as the recipe called for. Took closer to 1.5 hrs to reduce, but was excellent! I made the reduction, put it in the fridge, then heated it up at dinner time with the dill, lemon & salmon. Will definitely make again.

Excellent dish. Made it as written. The sauce doesn't need to be thickened with flour or butter. It's a nice light sauce that coats the pasta perfectly. Goes great with the salmon. Anything thicker/heavier would be too much. Grilled salmon placed on top of the pasta would make a prettier presentation, but either way works. I grilled my salmon the evening before with a salt-free lemon-pepper seasoning and made it into big chunks. Presenation was fine with the salmon mixed with sauce with fresh dill and a slight pinch of lemon zest on top. Perfect on a spring evening outside with a light white wine. Will make again.

Great recipe! We had some leftover salmon in the fridge and decided this was the best way to use it up. We used wide egg noodles (papardelle) instead of the angel hair and we all agreed the wide was the way to go. We also supplemented with some cold-smoked salmon (warmed), bacon, peas, and scallions. The additions were all fantastic. This recipe is a definite keeper.

This is a top-notch favorite. Sometimes I skip the pasta and do garlic-mashed potatoes. I sear salmon filets in a teeny bit of olive oil and lay whole across the pasta/potatoes, then pour on the sauce. Fantastic. No need to change a thing.

Fantastic! I used a less heavy cream than the recipe called for - about 3/4 cup total - and added peas and crushed red pepper as recommended by previous reviewers. This recipe is a keeper. It's easy to make, but not quick. Note that reducing the sauce takes close to an hour, but it's inactive time.

I have had this recipe in my "do later" book since 2005 when it first appeared in the magazine and I am so sorry I waited so long! It is wonderful and easy to make. An added plus - the kids loved it as well. Two things to remember - use heavy cream - this dish will not work with 1/2 and 1/2. Second, I grilled the fish instead of broiling and that worked fine. Next time I might add capers as they seem always to work well with salmon...

I made the recipe as printed except I used fresh pasta from the farmers market(a mixture of spinache and black pepper) and asparagus. It was very yummy and the sauce was light and dill infused. Barely fed 4. It is definitly a do-over.

Made a huge mistake and accidentally picked up fat free half and half- which curdled almost instantly. However, flavor and general idea good after thickening with some cornstarch. I had some leeks also that I added to the onions and some garlic. Despite my messing it up- still 3 forks. Will try correctly next time...

This was great but I did make a couple of slight changes. I steamed the salmon in a bamboo steamer and put olive oil, salt pepper and crushed red pepper on the salmon before steaming it to give it a little more depth of flavor. Overall it is not heavy at all, it is fresh and tangy. I also added petite peas which gave the dish great color. The recipee did not call for it but of course I added fresh Parmessan as well. This is a great recipe and needs to be enjoyed by all.

At first, I thought we were going to love this recipe. However, it was just so rich. There's one cup of cream for 4 servings! I wish there was some way to lighten the recipe. Flavor combination is really good, just too heavy.

I was trying to find new ways to cook salmon so I thought I would give this recipe a try. Since there are two of us, we had two fillets and grilled them. We made the full sauce recipe and I'm glad that we did. Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream and it reduced almost too much. Glad we added the water from the pasta. Will definitely make this again, but double the sauce if we serve more than the two of us.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed in this recipe as the sauce was oily looking and tasted as such. Perhaps I reduced it too much? I broiled the salmon much less than the recipe called for (about 5 min.) and it was delicious. I put a chipotle glaze over it before broiling.

I have cooked this many times and only had a problem when I was in a hurry (the sauce was thin because I didn't reduce long enough). It has become a traditional meal among friends the night before a long bike ride.

This dish is a favorite of mine. The flavor is fabulous. I follow the recipe and reduce the sauce for about 50 min. and then add cornstarch/water to thicken a bit more. I also bake my salmon with a lemon/pepper seasoning (1/2 stick butter, 1 tbsp lemon pepper seasoning, 1/4 tbsp garlic powder, 1/4 tbsp salt for 2-3lbs salmon). I think this adds a bit more flavor to the end result and then I serve a sauced salmon fillet along w/the pasta. Turns out great every time!

Rating: 4
I have made this three times, as written, and each time the sauce has had great flavor and thickened sufficiently. With due respect to previous reviewers, the key to this recipe is in the reduction. It takes time, and if you don't reduce to the specified end volume, you won't get the flavor or texture intended. This is my husband's most requested dish!

I did not rate this recipe because I made significant changes, but if I did, I would rate it three forks. After reading others' reviews about the sauce not thickening, I added only about 1 cup of chicken broth instead of three. That allowed the sauce to thicken nicely and more quickly. I also added chopped fresh tomato and some frozen peas (no need to precook) at the end, adding color and veggie goodness. All in all, we liked it very much. A glass of cold muscadet and a bowl of fresh cherries for dessert, and yum!

To speed up the process I added the vodka to the onions and boiled to burn off the alcohol before adding the other ingredients. I also used liquid concentrated stock - readily available in the UK though I am not sure about the US - and simply decreased the amount of water to 1 cup making it more concentrated and therefore decreasing the reduction time and with no need to add thickening agents. I also added some well rinsed salted baby capers towards the end of the cooking time. Like others I have also used smoked salmon as a quick fix. Marks and Spencer in the UK also does ready cooked and flaked hot smoked salmon and cooked herb and lemon marinated salmon which just needs warming through in the sauce.

Have made this many times. Also good with steamed spinach and side of pasta. Reduced the sauce by 2/3. The sauce is thin but agree that this is what makes the dish light and flavorful and it should remain light. Seved in pasta bowl with Salmon filet arranged on top and sauce poured over all. Also perferred linguini to the angel hair pasta.

Rating: 3
Three forks for changes I made after reading other reviews. To thicken sauce I added three tbsp of tomato paste which made it pretty salmon colored. This way I avoided using flour. The sauce was still a little thin at the end. I skinned and cubed fresh salmon and added to sauce in last five minutes of cooking. The extra salmon flavor made the sauce delicious. Otherwise followed recipe.

Rating: 0
Made this for friends and everyone loved it - but it did not "pop" for me, as another reviewer mentioned. I think the sauce needs some time to develop flavor, because the leftovers had more intense lemon and dill flavor than they did the first night. I would have liked a thicker sauce and will probably try some other reviewer's ideas next time I make this. Capers would be a great idea too!

Made this for dinner tonight and thought it was great. I was out of chicken stock so I made a quick salmon stock and it worked very nicely. Also garnished with Capers, which added a little flavor kick and some color. The sauce did not thicken enough for my tastes, even after much longer reduction times, so I finished it with some beurre manie. Other than that, the dish was terrific and I will definitely make it again.

I would definitely do this one again. It is easy and very tasty. I used shallots instead of onions, smoked salmon( time saver) and I thickened it with greek yoghurt plus a little sugar and it was enjoyed by all.

I made this dish last night for friends. They seemed to enjoy it. My version was slightly modified, I added 3 cloves of roasted garlic to the sauce and used about 2 tbsp of sour cream as well as a roux to thicken. The salmon was cooked with cracked pepper, lemon juice, dill and a little vodka with snow peas thrown in to saute. It was okay, not spectacular. I may stick to my usual cream sauce with garlic and nutmeg served over capellini with smoked salmon and capers.

Yum yum yum. We used shrimp instead of salmon, because that is what we had on hand, and we added about 8 oz of tomato sauce. It made a beautiful, creamy red vodka sauce, and the dill flavor was so delicious. The sauce was not too heavy at all, just light and rich in flavor. Served it over homemade pasta. We will definitely be making this again.

What a delightful recipe to enjoy alfresco with a glass of crisp white wine! The sauce is on thin side, but that seemed consistent with the light, fresh flavors of this dish. Marinated salmon fillets in a little olive oil, lemon juice, white wine and garlic and herb seasoning and cooked them on the grill. Served whole on top of the pasta then topped with the sauce . Definitely a new favorite -- and perfect for company!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it worked out perfectly, I had no problems with the sauce reducing like other reviewers, I found I had to watch it didn't reduce too much! Also, the dill was perfect, not overwhelming as I had thought it might be. The capellini pasta keeps the taste light and fresh, I would not change the pasta. A worthwhile elegant summer pasta!!

I love the flavors but find that unless I have fresh dill its not worth making. I do add cornstarch to thicken it otherwise its too runny. But other than that I really love the flavors and have made it several times. I serve it in a deep bowl. When the first hints of fall come I start to crave this dish its just comforting.

I had a go at the recipe and it was good. I would like to try it again though. I had to use dry dill (still good 3tsp) b/c the store was out of fresh. I also didn't put enough vodka in, but will next time. (Only have ml spoons and used 50ml) Shells were an excellent suggestion from one of the reviews as well as the flour. I added 2 tbsp of flour. I skipped the zest and added one whole lemon (4 tbsp). A crusty baguette and salad went well with this.

Absolutely easy and delicious. Skipped oil and used cooking spray for onion. Made a bit of a roux with 1 T of butter and some flour - not sure if that helped or not because sauce still not thick but still really good. Used 1/3 cup heavy cream and rest low fat milk. Also, 1 T of dried dill instead of fresh.

I made this dish last night and it was a hit! I used shells instead of capellini though and I think they soaked up the sauce better than capellini would have. It was easy to prepare....just very time consuming (although you can do other stuff at the same time while you're waiting for the alcohol to cook off). It was very good with crusty bread that soaks up every bit of the sauce. Delish!

I made this with leftover grilled salmon (which was delicious the first time around). Recycling it in this recipe was a bad idea: it was awful and had way too much lemon flavoring.

I halved the recipe, then forgot and added twice as much lemon zest and juice as I should have and it still turned out great. Took the advice of another reviewer and used some smoked salmon and fusilli. This dish is filling yet very light and delicate-tasting. I disagree about not letting the broth and vodka reduce; it's necessary to get the right concentration of flavors. This dish is so easy you might as well take the time to do it properly.

Excellent - flavourful but light. Made for 2 so 1/2ed the recipe. Used 18% cream and it thickened fine within 20m. Didn't use a colander, but left the pasta slightly wet after draining (instead of adding reserved liquid). Topped with steamed sugar snap peas for colour, crunch and flavour. Substituted farfalle for capellini. Delish.

I made this for company and made a few changes after reading the reviews. I added 2Tablespoons of flour to the onions and butter to make a roux. The sauce was perfect- thick and rich but delicate at the same time. I also used fusilli instead of capellini and would highly recommend it. Also used a smoked salmon filet because I had it in the refrigerator and it was delicious! My guests loved it, even those who claimed not to like salmon.
