Good ingredients, so it wasn't unpleasant, but this dish lacked something to pull it all together.

This is a healthy and quick weeknight dinner. I even used frozen swordfish and whole-wheat pasta, and it was still fine. I wish I could think of a way to punch it up a little, but it really is fine as is. It's pretty light, too. Everything comes together impossibly quickly, and it tastes great.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe. I just threw the snap peas and carrots in the last 3-4 min. of cooking time for the pasta, drained it and added everything else. The fish stays so tender & moist. Highly recommend

This is a good, basic fish and pasta recipe. While it's not partiularly impressive for guests, it is still quite good and easy to make. I will certainly be making it again for casual dinners. The dominant flavors are the saltiness and tang of lemon, chicken broth and white wine, which complement the mild flavor of swordfish nicely. In terms of texture, the firm swordfish chunks go very well with a slightly chewy semolina pasta. I have one recommendation regarding preparation... I think blanching the vegetables, rinsing them in cold water, and then heating them up again at the end is a little silly, and in my case it led to accidental overcooking. I would recommend blanching the vegetables at the very end (until just crisp-tender, < 2 minutes) and then tossing them with the sauce, pasta, and fish just before serving. -- NOTE: I made two minor modifications to this recipe: 1) I did not use clam juice because I didn't have any on hand, so I increased the white wine to 3/4 cup and the chicken broth to 3/4 cup to maintain the right amount of liquid; and 2) I added three small cloves of minced/crushed garlic to the saute pan before adding the swordfish chunks. Aside from these 2 alterations, I followed the recipe exactly.

It was a very easy recipe to follow & I agree with the cook from Bay Area, CA to do all the prep work before cooking. I followed the recipe with the swordfish and it was very tasty. Since my kids don't care for fish I substituted the swordfish with chicken, eliminated the clam juice, added garlic and 1/2c of milk, the kids loved it.

This is a really easy recipe and a refreshing change from oven-baking. Be sure to do all the prep work before beginning to cook. The cook time goes very fast.
