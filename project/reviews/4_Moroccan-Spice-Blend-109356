I bought a Moroccan spice blend while abroad that I've wanted to replicate ever since I ran out, and this version comes very close. It's great on fish, chicken, anything.

I use this with olive oil on small roasted potatoes accompanied with a yogurt, cucumber, mint sauce to dip. The yogurt cuts the spice. Gets rave reviews. Also a great marinade for grilled vegetables. I love it! I make a large batch and keep it on hand for lots of things.

One of the best versions of this classic blend that I've found. Yes, it works for rice, but is best as a rub or for a couscous. Will definitely use it often. Yes, I also would add some turmeric.

1 tsp cardamon, 1/2 tsp turmeric and a good dose of paprika are good additions to the mix. Garlic powder is also a good addition.

I reviewed this in May of 2007, and it's still a big fave. It has evolved over time, the spices change ratios and others work their way in, but the one constant is that I now make it without salt. Makes an incredible salt free seasoning for EVERYTHING!

I make large amounts of this blend, because it's one of my favourites. I use it on lamb steaks, in a mix of lamb, eggplant, mushrooms, and tomatoes over rice, etc. Delicious and versatile.

I love this blend and I make it in larger batches to save time - I use it at least twice a month. Great on the grill or in a skillet.

Does anyone have any advice about how to use this spice mix with rice? Would you recommend mixing it with yogurt and then blending with cooked rice or adding the spice mix to uncooked rice?

I think this blend is outstanding. I use it for a vegetarian stew with chickpeas and prunes that people go nuts over. Tip - When cooking with it, add it to whatever is being sauteed or cooked in even the smallest amount of oil - it allows the spices to bloom and you get the most depth of flavor out of them. I now make it in big batches, sometimes without cayenne, and use it in everything.

I made this recipe as instructed with the exception of cayenne pepper which I omitted. It was very good and mild. I tried it for the first time on my scrambled eggs in the morning. Very yummy. I will probably try it on fish and tofu soon.

I dip salmon fillets into this dry rub then sear the spiced side in clarfied butter or olive oil before flipping the fish and finishing in a hot oven. Serve simply or in a puddle of saffron cream sauce for an incomparable dinner.

Combined this with yogurt and marinated boneless skinless chicken filets in it; then baked them (with plenty of the marinade) in foil packets for about 25 mins at 450. Came out super juicy and flavorful. Great spice blend!

I used this spice blend to make lentils with lamb and sausage. I used a double batch of the spice and probably should have used a single. It was absolutely delicious as it was, but could have been a little less hot and aromatic. I served it inside of acorn squash and my husband who was skeptical when he first smelled it litkd it a lot. It was definitely spicy but I think cutting back to a single batch would cut the heat sufficiently and I wouldn't adjust the pepper blend.

Great on its own, or mix with yogurt and marinade chicken in it ... delicious.

This was delicious on sirloin steaks. Definitely spicy, but not overwhelming.

Best darn passover dish I've ever tasted, and I don't even like lamb. My husband loved it last Passover, and has been asking me to make it ever since. It will be a Passover tradition in our house (for second night supper) from now on! I'm a food columnist for our newspaper, and I've never cooked a recipe I didn't fiddle with or adjust, until this one. It was perfect as is.

this was great. we rubbed it on hangar steak today (i'm a culinary school student) and grilled it. DELICIOUS!

I do a lot of Moroccan cooking using this palette of spices, and thought this would be a good mixture to prepare in larger quantity and keep on hand. However, after making a double batch just now, and scaling back on both the black pepper and the cayenne, I think it would be prohibitively hot with the proportion of pepper as written.
