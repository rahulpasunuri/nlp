Delicious version of puttanesca.Really yummy. Full of flavor. But I wouldn't call it either "hot" or "spicy".Very good.

I hate to cook, but this recipe intrigued me when I saw it in Parade years ago because I love anchovies and I love spicy. I just loved it and it was easy to make as well as very healthy. The anchovies are a great source of calcium. All the incredients are good for you. Very tasty.

We like it spicy, so it was great. I used a little less garlic than called for.
