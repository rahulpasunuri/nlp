This recipe did not work exactly as it should have. My choux dough was beyond sticky, it was loose and there is no way I could have shaped it. Maybe I should have fried it free form but instead I added a lot more flour (more than 2 cups total when the recipe only calls for one cup) and they were still hard to shape. I almost considered not serving them but actually people really liked them--I made them a few hours before dinner and reheated them for dessert. I also did not use rose hips but otherwise followed the recipe and think actual rosehips would have been overpowering (but the rosewater was good). I also have a lot of syrup left over--not sure how I'll use it. My daughter and her friends loved it and would have given more than a 2 star but I'm a tough grader. I may make it again without the extra flour and see if I get more of a cream puff.
