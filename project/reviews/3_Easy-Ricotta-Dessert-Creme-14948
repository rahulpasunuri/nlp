I followed this exactly and then added limoncello. I'll be making this again!

This was wonderfully smooth and creamy. The secret is in blending it until it gets that way - it took me several minutes. I added a few drops of lemon extract -- yummy. I had about a quarter block of cream cheese left over so I threw that in, too. Even better. It's a very forgiving recipe and I'm betting it would be fabulous with orange extract and orange zest, too.

I really enjoyed this dessert, but I tweaked it to my taste. Instead of Almond Extract I used Vanilla and instead of berries I used 1/4 cup melted Special Dark Chocolate mixed in. It hit the spot. I ate it just like mousse but with a little texture to it!

Delicious and so easy to make. Wonderful for the diet-minded. I doubled the recipe and used both the lemon liquor and lemon zest.

Great over berries and angel food cake. I substituted mascarpone cheese for the ricotta. Everyone had seconds.

I'm not sure what I was expecting... but that wasn't it. I followed the recipe exactly & the resulting flavours were only "ok". (I found the zest really overpowering). I think I'll just use my leftover ricotta in pasta next time.

This recipe demands a 4 for its simplicity alone! I make it all the time whenever I have left over ricotta cheese. It is so delicious, especially with the almond extract! I always use part-skim ricotta, so with whole milk it would be totally sinful! How can you not try it, it's so easy!

This is a quick and simple dessert I learned from an Italian friend a few years back. The critical step is in how long you puree the ricotta in the blender - I usually leave it going at least 2 minutes longer than I think I should, which results in the wonderful creamy texture that makes this dessert sauce special. I usually serve this cream atop fresh fruit (figs, berries, ripe pear are my favorites) and drizzle wildflower honey and a touch of the very best balsamic you can find over the cream. I like serving biscotti or other cookie alongside. This dessert always draws comments from our friends.

Not a good use of ricotta - in my opinion - too grainy and not complimentary to the fruit. Cream cheese would have been better, just as easy, and less expensive.

I used a tablespoon of almond butter instead of almond extract because I happened to have that in the house (finally a use for that almond butter I bought out of sheer curiosity at the health food store!) This dessert tastes absolutely delicious, but it is heavy, so I would split the portion that is suggested for one person between two and surround it by plenty of berries.

I found this heavy and bland. I'd rather top fruit with a yogurt sauce (flavored with brown sugar and cinammon) - it's easier and lighter.

What a spectacular finish to an awesome dinner. I prepared the Salmon Wellington entree found on this website, served long grain and wild rice, along with fresh steamed asparagus. My guests couldn't stop raving! And, I have to say this entire meal was far better than any I had ever prepared. I will serve this many more times.

A great and simple dessert for the summer.

Wow! I served this dessert to our guests last night. It was so quick and easy to make. Following a seafood meal, this dessert was light, refreshing, and delicious. The tang of the lemon zest, together with the honey and almond made it a perfect addition to a great meal. Four forks up for this one!
