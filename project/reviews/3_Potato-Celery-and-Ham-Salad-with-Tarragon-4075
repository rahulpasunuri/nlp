This was simple to make and easy to eat. Unlike another reviewer, I did not think it was bland. And it ain't pasta, either - haha! I used what I had on hand: Yukon Gold potatoes, regular white-wine vinegar, sugar-cured country ham, and dried tarragon. Not having creme fraiche, I exchanged a tablespoon or two of mayo for sour cream, and added a dash of lemon juice. I ate this warm, and it made a great one-dish meal. Definitely would make again!

I didn't like the taste of this pasta at all. Maybe I did something wrong. I can't image what. The recipe is quite simple. My husband had two servings of this pasta, but, I couldn't talk him into a third.

Pretty good but rather bland. I used the creme fraiche. Will make it again doubling the vinegar and perhaps adding a bit of red onion.

This salad is a real four forker according to the fair maiden to whom I am married. If she likes it, it's got to be good. I did double the amount of ham, though. I thought the mayo was a bit thick, so I thinned it with some ranch dressing.

I make this recipe several times during the summer. It is simple, easy to make and very good. I get many, many compliments when sharing with others.
