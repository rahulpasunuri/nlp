I've made this for 2 years now at Xmas time -- one of my favorite cookies and definitely my favorite molasses cookie hands down. Just don't overbake -- easy to do as with all darker cookies.

Definitely a strong molasses and spice flavor; I loved this cookie. Much better texture than other cookies I've made with similar flavors. I'd definitely use the currants vs. raisins. And I skipped the cloves and used allspice instead.

Excellent cookies, but they must have made very very tiny ones to make 64!

These cookies were my favorite of the several recipes I tried this Christmas. Fabulous. I will make again soon.

I made as directed, except for soaking the currants in creme de cassis instead of water. Really good.

These were a lot better than I thought they would be. I also substituted yellow raisins for currants and used allspice instead of cloves. Added 1/2 stick extra butter (mm mmm)and dropped them onto a greased cookie sheet immediately instead of chilling. My beloved stole the plateful to take to work the next day he thought they were so good! I'd make again!

This was one of the best cookies I have ever made. I replaced the currants with yellow raisins and added chocolate chips, froze the rolls for about 45minutes (because I couldn't wait!), and they came out delish!
