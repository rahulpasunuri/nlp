I thought just maybe I would love this despite the previous reviewer's comments (since I love olives so much). I followed the recipe exactly as written, except used half green olives / half kalamata. It was ust blah. Not horrible, but not very good. It's like a non-sweet muffin with olives - kind of a weird combo. I haven't given up on it yet - tonight, I'll try toasting it and smearing it with goat cheese (that can make anything taste good!). I've had other olive breads before (yeast breads - like french bread with olives), which were terrific. I would spend your time making one of those instead.

This sounded so good I knew it was too good to be true. It was salty, had a strong Baking Powder-like flavor and was a strange density. No one here ate it. My satisfaction with the Epicurious recipes is turning out more duds than great meals (and I've been cooking non-stop for 3 weeks for the holidays) but the ones that do turn out fabulously make it worth it. I'll just keep on trying! I don't know who will ever read this because I'm probably the only dope dumb enough to cook this bread but I would like to suggest highly the Turkey Meatball and Escarole Soup as well as the Inside Out German Chocolate Cake from this site.
