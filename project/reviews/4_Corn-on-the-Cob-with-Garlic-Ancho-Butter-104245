Tip - slightly melt the butter before adding all the ingredients. Then let it sit in the frig to firm back up. Makes mixing the lime SO much easier.

We used ancho chile powder for this and it was so so good. We BBQ'd some shrimp with the corn and put this butter on both. AWESOME. Have made it several times.

The garlic-ancho butter is amazing! I haven't even had it on the corn yet and I can't stop eating it. I made it exactly as written and loved it. My only thought is that it is just a tad too salty for me. Next time I might cut it to just 1tsp of salt. (Yes, I used unsalted butter). Make it just for bread or rolls if you don't want to make corn.

Oh- Forgot to add that we roast the corn in the husk on the bbq. This adds smokiness that really pairs well with the cumin and ancho.

Fantastic! This has become a summer favorite for us! Everyone I serve it to seems to really loves it. I do add about a teaspoon of cumin and a green onion to the recipe. Highly recommend trying it!

AWESOME! Used the leftovers on grilled shrimp - fantastic! Easy summer dish. Some guests were even stealing some to put on crackers.

This was overall OK. Some people liked it, others were purposefully avoiding the concoction. Having married into a Texan family (I'm a Yankee) I thought this would be an impressive accompaniment with corn. Instead, they didn't know what to do with it.

I had to double the butter to keep pace with all the other ingredients! Be conservative, especially with the lime, or you'll end up with slime. The butter freezes perfectly, and is delicious when melted over cooked frozen corn. You'll use a full recipe for months.

Loved this recipe, but I substituted parsley for the cilantro and it had a fabulous subtle taste. Our guests were putting on French bread and spreading it on the barbecued tri-tip when the corn was finished!

Incredible taste!! How to impress your friends in one easy lesson. This is one recipe that you will be giving out...alot! The butter makes up a lot but it lasts for ever in the fridge. Try bbqing the corn.....it definately has a superior taste over boiled corn

We grilled our corn slathered in the butter and wrapped in foil. Yum! I made a double batch so people could add even more after grilling, but that wasn't really necessary as the flavor was permeated after cooking in the foil. Easy and excellent - we'll definitely use this again.

We grilled the corn which is good in itself, but the chilies gave a nice flavor.

Why limit this gem to corn - can be used on crackers or bread - its great.

I am a complete novice. This recipe was my first using a food processor. I tried it using the Ancho chile and substituted sea salt for kosher salt. It adds a whole new flavor to corn on the cob which is usually rather bland. The milder chile is just right I think. The stuff is a bit rich so next time I may use margarine instead of butter.
