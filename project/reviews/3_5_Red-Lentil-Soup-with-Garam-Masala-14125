Loved it. Since this soup is so simple (aside from the spice blend), you need good stock and good spices. I made a vegetable scrap stock (save vegetable scraps from on hand until you have enough (mine was mostly onion skins and some fennel stalks), plus I added a couple carrots, a couple cloves of garlic, ginger, a few chicken wing tips, and some dried herbs and spices), and let it simmer overnight. The result was very flavourful (it was my first time making this frugal and easy stock) . Also, many of the spices I used I had ground myself (I made my own chili powder, ground my own coriander, turmeric, black pepper). Grinding your own spices results in a much fresher and stronger end-product than the pre-ground spices that have been on the store shelves for who-knows-how-long. You just need to have the right tools and then you won't have to buy both a ground and whole version of each spice. I also had some store-bought garam masala on hand to which I compared the smell of mine and this was stronger, although I think the blend was slightly different. Anyway, after blending the soup it was thinner than I expected but it thickened up after sitting for a while. Had it with some homemade bread and it was yummy. Quite on the spicy side though so it may not work for some.

I was really excited about making this soup but the mix of spices just didn't work for me. I followed the recipe to a tee but it came out bitter and bland at the same time. will not make it again.

Divine! I made the recipe as written and am enjoying it right now. Very easy and comforting on a cold day.

Absolutely delicious! my only problem was the lentil stayed hard even though I cooked the soup for more than 1 hour, but that could be fixed by cooking the lentil first by themselves and then adding them to the soup :)

I thought this was really good. I didn't have ground cardamom or cloves so threw in 3 whole of each (I halved the recipe). I also threw in one cup of fresh green beans, and served it over rice. I soaked the lentils beforehand and just used a potato masher to mash them in the pot at the end - very easy!

I really liked this, but I did mess with the spice combination a bit. I already had some garam masala on hand (I use this recipe: http://www.ochef.com/r75.htm), so I didn't want to have to make more for this recipe. I used 5 tsp of my garam masala (which is not as hot because it doesn't have cayenne), plus the 1 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp turmeric (because the spice recipe I used doesn't have turmeric.) It was very brightly flavored and spicy, but not hot. I made homemade roti (chapati) to go with it (great instructional video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD4o_Lmy6bU I would definitely make this soup again. It would be great with some smoked chicken or even rotisserie chicken added. I *did* soak the lentils and the soup was definitely creamy textured after pureeing. If you're going for chunky, I would either not soak or not puree or both. I agree with a previous reviewer that a little bit of some sort of tomato (fresh or sauce or paste) would be a nice addition, as well.

Soooooo good. I made it extra thick, and we scooped it up with hot fresh homemade naan. Mmmmmmmm..... Even my husband who claims to "hate beans" (I know, I know, lentils aren't a bean) absolutely LOVES this because it is spicy and flavorful.

Yeesh, this was not a soup that I enjoyed. My GF liked it, but like so many others who commented negatively I thought the flavors were poorly combined. I live in NYC and have a wide and varied palate, so it's not like I'm a foody neanderthal. It did tasted someone mashed together pumpkin pie and lentil soup. I don't understand the spice combination working for anyone else's tastebuds, but apparently some do like it. I ended up adding the juice of 1.5 lemons to balance out the flavors a bit, but I don't even think I'll eat the leftovers. Yuck.

This was good, I mixed up the spices myself and then added an additional TBS or pre-made garam masala since other reviewers said it was bland. I also added some ground ginger, and used veg.broth instead. we picked up some samosa and nan from a local indian place and it was a hit with the BF. I will serve the left overs( of which there was alot) Over some basmati to a vegitarian house guest I am having this week.

Very good with a few revisions: don't soak the lentils (if they are the red ones) or the dal will be too soupy. I suggest adding a large chopped tomato to the onion mixture and cook along with it, half the spices and save the other half for another time. With these revisions it is greatly improved

Fantastic recipe--better than No Fish Go Fish in Portland. I play with the spices each time, but now rely a lot on the Garam Masala blend from Penzeys spices. You can look on-line, and it is better than making my own!

Yum! I reduced the water to one cup and included two diced carrots with the onions... served with minted yogurt and whole wheat naan. Outstanding! (also included 1/2 inch grated ginger for extra kick)

I love this recipe, and use it as a base, throwing in whatever veg is lurking -- sweet potatoes, kale, etc. I often find that adding one or two preserved lemons provides just the right amount of zing. It freezes beautifully, and is my standard wintertime lunch, with a dollop of Greek yogurt.

I used a commercially prepared garam masala and added chicken sausage. Fuond the spicing good, not too hot

I don't get it. I love Indian food, I regularly use these spices and I tend to agree with cooks from Cambridge, but this was borning. The heat overpowers any complexity of spice. I'm hoping that tomorrow, after the spices have time to marry, it'll redeem itself.

This soup was excellent, especially on a cold winter day. The first bites tasted cinamonny, but the spice built up over time. It would probably be great with a little naan on the side. I didn't have time to soak the lentils more than 30 minutes, and it came out just fine.

This recipe is easy to halve. Also, I make a full and healthful meal out of this soup - and break up the delicious but spicy flavor - by serving it with a scoop of basmati or kalijiri rice and some cucumber and yoghurt raita.

After a friend tempted me with a taste of this wonderful soup at work I was hooked. I pestered his wife for the recipe for weeks. I make this dish every few weeks and love it each and every time.

I will definately be making this again, except that I won't be putting as much cayenne in it. My mouth was still burning an hour later! =) Either I'll cut back or add it right before I serve.

Very rich. I uncased and browned some turkey sausage (but you can use just some ground turkey or other ground meat) first and then followed the recipe exactly. Very healthy and flavorful.

The Soup was boring. Yes, definately Garam Masala, but there were so many spices that the soup was gritty. This soup needed some additional textures and flavors with less overall spices in order to cut down on the grit factor.

This has become my favorite soup. It is easy, flavorful, and nutritious. I've made it enough times to know that it is also a flexible recipe--if you're in the mood for some heat, this soup will benefit from some extra cayenne. I also like to add a little ginger, though this recipe is delicious in its original form.

I liked this and my husband really liked it a lot. I thought it had plenty of heat from the spices--in fact, my face was flushed after eating it and through most of the next day! Plus, it was fun to make because I got to use all those spices I don't usually get to.

Rating: 2
I liked it, but wasn't crazy about it. My husband could only eat half of it; he said it tasted "chalky". Would rather have a red lentil dhal....but when you can't be roasting seeds and grinding them yourself, this will satisfy your lentil craving. I would up the spices and decrease the liquid to increase flavor.

This lentil soup is a refreshingly different from the brown lentil soup I'm use to. Not only does the red lentil itself gives a beautiful color for a soup, but the exciting spices of the middle east wakes up the taste buds. I would make this again.

This is a wonderful soup for anyone who appreciates Indian seasoning. Even a friend who had "never had a favorable lentil experience" enjoyed this soup. I add a dollop of yogurt for color and flavor contrast.

Nice soup, just make sure you stick to red lentils- green lentils won't break down to form a thick, consistent broth.

Rating: 3
A flavorful and satisfying meal in a bowl...I pureed half the soup and added it back into the pot, to retain some lentil texture. I used a homemade ground chili blend that's considerably hotter than the normal supermarket-variety bland dust...it definitely spiced things up! The wife has already asked me to make another batch, so she must have enjoyed it as much as I did!

Big thumbs down - I love garam masala and curried foods but this was just plain nasty. The cloves and cinnamon made it taste like a spicy green pumpkin pie filling (which I hate). Greenish in color - not very attractive - and a thick pasty texture. Oh well, live and learn.

I didn't have cumin around, so I left it out and this soup was still very good. i didn't use as much water either, so the flavors were more concentrated. served it over rice for a very quick meal that was filling and nutritious!

A different reason folks might think this soup is not spicy enough with the current proportions: use Indian hot chili powder, not the chili powder commonly found in the grocery store, used for making Mexican chili. They're totally different.

This was a really yummy recipe! I will make it again and again. I think it does need a little more chili pepper, and maybe some more salt to jazz it up a bit - otherwise 4 forks. But overall, excellent!

Very good and more filling than one would expect for a soup. Upon completion, it is quite thick thus very filling. I cut the recipe in half for two adults and found it to be plenty. Served with warm nann or pita bread. I'll definately make it again! Happy Cooking!!!

Delicious and satisfying. Per other comments, I doubled the amount of each spice, except for the cayenne, which resulted in a richly flavored soup. Highly recommended.

Rating: 3
Following previous suggestions, I doubled the spices except for the cayenne, which I omitted in favor of a few red pepper flakes. I also did not bother with pureeing the soup, simply let it cook another hour or so until the lentils started to fall apart and gave it a nice texture. The result was a wonderfully warm, spicey soup that was great served over rice and garnished with a bit of yogurt or feta cheese. I will be making this again, and often. It's simple, inexpensive, healthy, and very, very good.

A great and satisfying soup with wonderful aroma. I made a few changes. First I browned 1 pound of sausage (w/ sage) then added One large minced onion (instead of two medium). I increased the cumin and cinnamon to one tablespoon each and reduced the salt (in case the sausage made it too salty, you can add it later. Then, I reduced the amount of water to 4 cups. Not too many changes and it was a hit. My picky 16-year-old daughter had 4 bowls!

We really liked this soup. Even my husband who isn't a big lentil fan liked it. It was quick and easy - perfect for weekdays. I took another reviewer's suggestion and made it stronger by halfing the lentils and leaving the spices the same(expect the salt and cayenne, which I halfed). Also, garnished it with fresh chopped cilantro and plain yogurt. If you like Indian food, you'll like this soup!

This recipe makes a vat -- use a pot at least 4.5 qts. If I made it again, I'd cut it in half and not puree it so much. Also, it begs some kind of garnish.

Excellent: it is easy to substitute a prepared garam masala spice mix augmented with pepper, ground cloves and cumin. I left off the salt until the very end so as to avoid oversalting.

This soup is extraordinary. I made it as is except I doubled the cumin and increased the salt. I think the people that thought it was bland must have used salt free chicken broth or something. This is a boldly flavored authentic tasting soup that is so complex and without the usual grated ginger etc etc saga ingredients I usually love to use. Only tried this because other than the spices the pantry list is small lentils, onion chicken broth...things I always have on hand. Pleasantly surprised.

This is fabulous! After reading other reviews and noticing that several folks commented that the soup seemed to be missing something, I decided to double all of the spices, except for the cayenne and salt. This step is exactly what this soup needs! Mine turned out extremely aromatic and full of intense flavor, especially after I let it sit overnight in the fridge to allow it to thicken before I served it. I didn't puree any of the soup, as I found it thick enough the following day, and I liked the idea of still having "bites" of lentils. If you do double the spices, don't be alarmed by the thick mixture that results when you add them to the cooked onions. Just keep an eye on the mixture so it doesn't burn and proceed with the recipe. I served this soup with steamed jasmine rice and cucumber-yogurt salad to cool our mouths...simply delish and a new regular main-course soup in our kitchen!

I KEEP HAVING TO MAKE THIS RECIPE ON THE REQUEST OF MY 9 YEAR OLD SON, WHO ASOLUTELY ADORES IT! WE SERVE IT AGAIN THE SECOND DAY (WHEN IT GOES REALLY THICK) WITH FRIES DIPPED INTO IT LIKE A CURRY SAUCE - DELICIOUS - A REAL HIT WITH THE FAMILY!

This soup was good - just not great. I was expecting this combination of spices to be out-of-this-world-wonderful. It was easy to make, just lacked the flavor punch I was expecting. Yes, I'd heed other reviewers advice and watch the heat. I halved the cayenne and it was still almost too hot!

Rating: 3
I recommend reducing the cayenne to permit the other flavours to "breathe". I used a homemade garam masala and added the turmeric,chile powder, cayenne, salt and pepper. The proportions of the spices in my mixture are slightly different as I obtained the recipe from an Indian cookbook.It was still delicious. My recipe uses whole herbs, freshly ground, which enhances the flavour. We pass a sweet mango chutney as a sweetener . I feel this is a better accompaniment than honey if you prefer a sweeter taste.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good but it still is missing something...we added some honey to sweeten it up a little. Next time I'll add some coconut milk to make it a little creamier and instead of pureeing all of the soup, I'll puree only half so the soup regains some substance with the pieces of lentils. Overall, it was great poured over rice.

Spicy but easily adaptable to individual tastes. Wonderfully fragant and filling - try it with a dollop of sour cream or plain yoghurt to combat the spice!!
