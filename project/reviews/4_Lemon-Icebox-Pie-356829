I just made this for Passover (using the crust from the Passover Lemon Cheesecake with pistachios as in this recipe)with Meyer lemons. I served it with pistachio ice cream and strawberry sorbet. It was so easy and beyond yummy. This easily serives 10 or more if you don't have big slices. I am looking forward to eating the leftovers tonight. It's great for entertaining because you make it in advance.

This is as close to a perfect dessert as I've had, and is incredibly easy to make. No adjustments to the recipe are necessary...you will not be disappointed.

This lemon pie is really fabulous! What a great dessert to have in your freezer when you are entertaining. I served a raspberry strawberry sauce with each slice and it complimented the pie beautifully. In fact, I loved this recipe so much that I ordered the cookbook!

Absolutely one of the best desserts I have ever made, and certainly one of the easiest. Recipe works just as described - no surprises. Tastes wonderful, very refreshing. Will certainly make this again.

Strong lemon flavor, very smooth and silky. I made the pie filling and whipped cream as written, however I do not like graham cracker crust so I made a crust with lemon cookies.

Yummy! All of my dinner quests loved it! Easy to make. Baked for 26 minutes, cooled then cooled in refrig for several hours before putting in the freezer. Made on Thursday for Saturday dinner party. Took others suggestion and took out of freezer about 45 minutes before serving....perfect. Added the sweet cream and topped that with a few slices of fresh strawberries...great presentation. Also....following the directions of cutting pie with knife dipped in warm water which ensured a clean cut and no crumble mess.

This is great. I have made it as written, but prefer to make it with lemon thins (such as Anna's or Trader Joe's brand)--I just substitute a 9 oz. box of thins for the graham crackers. I had no trouble with the 25 minute cooking time (I used my convection oven set to the temperature indicated in the recipe). I like mine at refrigerator temp. Good stuff!

I loved this! I've already made this twice once with lime juice and once with lemon juice, and both turned out great. I like that the pie is not too sweet and just the right amount of tart. I would recommend this to anyone.

I made this with Meyer lemons and it was great. I halved this recipe and put into a 7" spingform pan, taking the graham cracker crumbs up to about an inch below the top rim. I just trimmed the crust line with a sharp knife and let the crumbs fall onto the cake in a circular perimeter. Half the volume makes a great cake for 6-8 mini servings, keeps well for at least a week. Just a small piece is enough to finish off a nice meal.

Made this earlier in the week for a dinner party last night. It was fantastic. I did have to bake it a few minutes longer. Served with blackberries.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. I did have to bake it closer to 35-40 minutes to get the outer edge to set. As previous reviewers suggested I took the pie out one hour before serving. It was VERY tart, but everyone loved it. The crust is great, and the sweetened whipped cream cuts some of the tartness. Really tasty pie!

Unbelievable flavor!! Super easy to make and takes no time. The longest time it took was to juice the lemons. My husband literally liked the plate. I followed the recipe to a T by the way.

I was blown away by this recipe. I usually am not a big fan of lemon desserts...but I LOVE this pie! I used 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk (all I could find at the store) and it was perfect. I did not think it was too sweet. This recipe is also so easy and great for entertaining as you can prepare it ahead. I recommend leaving it out of the freezer for about an hour prior to serving so it is not frozen.

Super easy and super tasty! I don't use a food processor so I eyeball the crunched up graham crackers. After I transferred the crust into the pan, I set the pan in the sun while I was making the filling and that helped set the crust. Don't forget--use SWEETENED condensed milk--otherwise I suspect it would be a very tart pie! Will definitely make again!

Made this for a dinner party for 8 the night before the party, and it was definitely a hit. Used a 10-inch springform pan, compensated with additional crust and not as much sugar, and 30-45 minutes out of the freezer it was delicious in very thin slices. There were plenty of leftovers - which I sent home with guests. Didn't bother with the whipped cream and used regular lemons from a regular supermarket. Will definitely make this again in the summer.

This pie was DELICIOUS! I served it with a dab of whipped cream and fresh strawberry-blackberry sauce. It was nice and tart, but not too tart, and the texture was just perfect. It was the perfect finish to a romantic dinner.

I made this over the holidays this year and this has to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. Every one of us oohed and awed as we ate it. So easy and keeps for a week! Thought the recipe was perfectv as is!!!

The recipe calls for 2 14 oz cans. The cans are 12 oz. I worried that 24 oz was not enough so I added several more to make the 28 oz called for in the recipe. It wouldn't all fit in the crust so they must have meant 2 12 oz cans. Also, extremely tart, must have meant sweetened milk?

Rating: 4
Delish! I also added the almonds to the crust and it was nice that the crumbs were chunky and not fine. I found I had WAY too much cream, I would half it next time. And it's very sweet/tart so you don't need a big slice. I only froze it for 9 hours and my guests loved that it was cold but not frozen solid. A definite keeper.

This was a delicious, refreshing dessert. I served it to my family and everyone loved it. I will make this again and again!

Yum. I liked it as-is, and the simplicity also leaves room for improvisation. If I make it again, I'll grind up some almonds along with the graham crackers, and substitute almond extract for some or all of the vanilla in the cream.

I've made this twice, it's delicious and great for summer. However, it is a very tart/lemony desert and a little over sweet for my taste (all my guests love it as written). The last time I made it I substituted the juice of two limes for some of the lemon juice, which made the pie a little more subtle/mellow. This also makes it taste a little less lemon-drop sweet. Either way it's a keeper.

I'm not a huge lemon fan but if I'm going to eat something lemon-flavored, I want it intensely lemony and this fits the bill!

The consistency of this is lovely and cold and smooth, a great summer dessert, but using sweetened condensed milk, this was too sweet. Next time, would either use one can of sweetened milk and one not, or cut the sugar from the crust, or both. Raspberries are really pretty on top, and the tart helped tone down the sweet.

Rating: 3
Giving it 3 forks instead of 2 because I think I must've done something wrong; especially when I read the reviews that say "too sweet"! Where's the sugar? The recipe calls for condensed milk, not sweetened condensed. Was I supposed to use sweentened? I mistakenly also refrigerated the pie instead of freezing it. It was still good; just not great (and pretty tart!)I'll wait to hear from other reviewers, or I'll just make it again using the sweetened condensed (maybe one of each?) and this time I'll freeze it!

I wanted to add one more thing to my comment/review. After baking the leftover pie filling in the two custard cups, I had an idea. One could take the empty lemon halves after the juice has been squeezed, slightly cut the bottoms to make them flat and be able to "sit". The take the cooked and cooled filling that was just baked in a large custard or pie pan, and spoon them into the "cups". Then top with creme and raspberry (framboise) sauce.

Rating: 4
I made this pie not knowing what to expect. The filling is like a very thick, lemony custard. I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, and it is smaller than 9". So I used two custard cups for the extra filling. As it turned out, I needed to bake the pie for 35 minutes, even though it was smaller than the recipe. The custard cups for only 20 mins. I also used canned Redi-Whip. It is a really good, rich and tangy dessert. Definitely not too sweet, so the frozen consistency as well as the tartness is very refreshing. It would also probably be good with a raspberry over the whipped creme.

This was wonderful...12 people raved about the dessert. I made this yesterdeay in the late morning...cooled it on a rack, chilled it in the refrigerator and put it uncovered into the freezer overnight. Covered it this morning and served it tonight. I sliced the dessert late this afternoon and put it back, covered in the freezer, so it was easy to plate with the whipped cream. ...a real crowd pleaser...

As has been said by many of the previous reviewers, this was a delicious, refreshing dessert. My husband, who advised me when he saw I was making this, hates lemon dessert, loved it. Easy and awesome. Just please note-- "condensed milk" is "sweetened condensed milk" .

What a fantastic pie!! I read other reviews and used 16 graham crackers (and more butter/sugar/salt) but I had more than plenty for the crust. Even 12 might have been plenty. The filling is delightful; I thought it would turn out too creamy and sweet, but it tasted like slightly creamy lemonade! So good.

Absolutely delicious. I made mine the night before and I think the extra time in the fridge really did the pie service. Lemon flavor is front and center in this dessert, and the condensed milk makes for a delicious custard-like filling.

This pie was a really good but too rich after a large dinner. It was kind of last minute so it was only in the freezer for 2 hrs before serving, i would recommend the full 6 hours though since it tasted much better the next day after it was in the freezer over night. I really liked how easy it was to make but i'm not a huge fan of custard (my lemon tree was overflowing.) The cream really made the dessert great i it would be a shame to skip it since it is so easy!! Note: I used meyer lemons and it only took 5 to yield 1 1/4 cup juice. I also learned that condensed milk is the same as sweetened condensed milk after a major freak out in comparing the cans to the recipe!

Easy to make and elegant to serve. My husband loves all things lemon and he loved this. Followed the recipe exactly but agree with previous reviews that a few more graham crackers are needed to make the crust go "half way up the side" of the springform pan. Next time I will try it with Meyer Lemons.

Made this pie today for a dinner party. I ended up baking it for ~45 minutes before the wobbliness was confined to just the center. I was only able to freeze it for 2 hrs but it still turned out great! 6.28 delicious radians of this lemon pie: the perfect way to celebrate pi day!

Yummmmy! What a refreshing dessert. You don't need a large piece of it, because it is rather tangy/tart and rich, but you'll keep coming back for more and more (tiny) pieces! I would definitely make this again. It looked beautiful and was super creamy!

This was delicious. I brought it to a friend's for a Mardi Gras dinner party; everyone loved it. I let it sit at room temperature for 30" before serving. Luscious consistency. I did make 1 1/2 times the crust. Will definitely make this again. I bet you could substitute key lime juice rather than lemon for a version of key lime pie.

This turned out perfectly and was delicious and tart. I let the pie defrost in the refrigerator for several hours before serving and it had a perfectly firm but creamy consistency. This will certainly be a recipe I return to for special occasions.

Very delicious! Made this over the weekend for a friends birthday party and everyone loved it -- even the kids! Very rich and creamy (how could it not be with 8 egg yolks) and pretty easy. Beautiful presentation (I didn't have a pastry bag, so I served whipped cream on the side...but it still looked so nice!). Would definitely make again!

Really tangy and delicious, with a lovely creamy consistency. Plus, it looks terrific and got a lot of oohs and ahs. I substituted digestive biscuits for the graham crackers (1.75 crushed cups). I found I needed to let it defrost for about 30 min to get the key lime pie consistency. After 15 min it was still pretty frozen.
