Red cabbage is not unlike collard greens in that it can be cooked a long time and still be wonderful, and recipes don't need to be set in stone. Wish the recipe was 'up there,' but if I remember it correctly as one who loves red cabbage, the apple can be substituted with applesauce, and don't forget a few cloves, and bacon doesn't have to be used, instead use EVOO, and/or bacon drippings, or ham pieces, or nothing. The potato can be "scraped" into the pot, or use a box-shreeder - this thickens the mixture, which if cooked long enough will thicken on its own with the natural sugar in the cabbage and apple(s). Also, the potato increase the simple carbohydate count for those who have Diabetes. One caveat, it was mentioned that the vingar makes this recipe; however, that is not unusual for many recipes, and definely all beans (especially black beans), and greens. Wine can be used, too but let it cook a long time with the veggies.

I made this cabbage to accompany the beef stew and soda bread that my husband and I ate to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and this recipe DID NOT disappoint! It's the most unique cabbage recipe I've ever had. I did change it up a bit - I omitted the apple, onion, and peeled potato (I was serving another side dish of mashed potatoes, I didn't want to overdo it) and it still turned out phenomenally! The red wine vinegar makes this dish in my opinion! I didn't use as much butter either to cut down on fat and calories, but really, you don't need it! It's just as delicious without it!!! Make this, you won't be sorry!

Perfect but doesn't need honey. Great on top of a baked potato for leftovers.

The review below by Victoria from Los Angeles is right on. We make her version regularly to go with good quality German sausage.

We enjoyed this very much. I cooked this dish with sauteed pork chops. I cut the pork into pieces and added them to the finsihed dish. I also agree about omitting the potatoes and honey. However, in place of the honey I used a few spoonfuls of apricot preserves giving it a wonderful backround sweetness. To finish it off, I added fresh nectarine slices as an edible garnish, highlighting the apricot preserves and adding texture.

We loved this dish. We added some pre-cooked sausage and made it a one-dish meal. Used the cuisinart to chop the cabbage and onion, and the grating blade to grate the potato. (The key to getting the potato to cook through is to have it grated finely.)

Unlike other reviewers I followed this recipe and loved it. It is fast, easy and delicious. The combination of all these ingredients really works. Great choice for an inexperienced cook who wants a tasty and very colourful side dish.

I usually hate cooked cabbage but had a ton of red cabbage I needed to use. This recipe was surprisingly tasty! It smelled good and was a nice combination of sweet and savory. I did omit the bacon and I don't think it affected the outcome at all.

I made this for dinner tonight with a few alterations. No potato. 2 medium white onions. 2 small apples. cider rather than red wine vinegar. also added about a cup of beef broth. simmered for an hour. then added wine, sugar, salt and pepper. It was delicious.

I followed the German reviewer's recommendations and fried the chopped bacon first, added the bay leaf and cooked for about 1 hour. I did not try the potato/honey - used 1 teaspoon of sugar. We loved it and it's easier than it looks, especially if you use a cuisinart to slice the cabbage. This was recommended with Pork Chops with Sauce Poivrade and Wine-Braised Red Cabbage (also on this site). The meal was fantastic.

If I might add my two cents without ever having made this particular recipe. My mother is German and I lived in Germany for years, so I know good 'Rotkohl.' First of all, you can skip the bacon if you like...or, you can begin by browning the bacon first, then thowing in the onions and butter, and sauteing that well before throwing in the red cabbage and apple -- and make it a tart apple! Add a bay leaf and saute that with the cabbage too. Instead of water (barely to cover), add some good broth if you like, and some ground cloves. But the key is simmering this concoction over low heat for a good while -- like 90 minutes -- to let the flavors marry. Near the end, when everything is nice and tender, season it all with salt, pepper, vinegar, and sugar and splash in a healthy dose of a big dry red wine (white would also work, but...). Simmer a bit longer and serve.

I agree with another reviewer - skip the potatoes!! Otherwise, this is an great dish with a nice flavor. (We thought that the potatoes were unnecessary and unattractive). We will definitely make this again.

This was a great change from the every day. Though a little labourious is goes well with the Skillet Saurbrauten found on this website. I had no problemts with the potatoes.

I have made this recipe several times. It is easy and goes well with October fest sausage. A good meal in the fall when the cabbage and apples are fresh.

Even after a second "helping" of wine and vinegar this one tasted of nothing and the potato make it look rather unappetising.

My test was going well until the addition of the potato and honey. Even with extra cooking time,the grated potato just wouldn't cook through.
