OK, I think that this recipe is very delicious. My issue is that I don't think you need all of that flavor unless you are trying to mask the taste of something. My recommendation, use a cheaper fish! Halibut costs a fortune and is delicious alone. Or, pair this sauce with pasta - it's vodka sauce, a classic.

We thought this was great. I always try to follow the recipe as written the first time - and did this time - with a minor change - we left the zucchini out. We all loved it. I think I might slice the mushrooms next time and am still not sure I would put the zucchini in - not my favorite. I used sorrel because we love it. I will definitely make this again.

I was a bit bewildered at first, attempting a new recipe with three young children at the witching hour. It was relatively easy to put together and I did not make the "mash" to go with it as we're trying to eat healthier. Instead, I used more spinach and sautéed that with the mushrooms and carrot matchsticks (I didn't have zucchini). It was a beautiful presentation and the flavors were delicious.

This recipe is truly amazing. I used 2 inch thick Chilean Sea Bass and baked between 17 and 18 minutes. Perfect. I also used basil in place of the sorrell/spinach and decreased butter to about 3 tablespoons as recommended by others. Pulsed tomatoes lightly in food processor and drained before adding. Used the Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Chives (September 2003) recipe for the potatoes. It calls for lots of roasted garlic, which compliments the delicate flavors of this dish beautifully. I also think it would be lovely with creamy grits in place of the potatoes. My new "go to" recipe when I really want to impress!

This was excellent. I did make some minor changes - used only two Tbsp butter in the sauce, left out the red pepper, and served it with pureed cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes. I also blanched the zucchini before adding it to the mushrooms in order to remove some of the wateriness you often get with zucchini. This is company fare.

OMG: I used 1/2 of the butter and 1/2 of the cream. I definitely would use basil instead of sorrel. Would top with capers and parsley? Beautiful presentation. A keeper

This recipe was such a hit, and it was surprisingly easy to put together. I used spinach instead of sorrel (not available) and canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I think next time I'll halve the portions of halibut as this recipe (especially with the mashed potatoes) was pretty rich and it will save some money. Also I might sub rice for potatoes as well, but it's great that you can play around with this. Try it! You will be so proud of yourself :-)

The white wine shallot sauce alone is perfect. I left out the tomatoes and sorrel and just sauteed mushrooms with the red pepper - delicious.

Oh My ...this was just spectacular and exceptionally easy. I changed the recipe a little, since I didn't have mushrooms or zucchini. For Halibut - bake as suggested with oil and s&p. For Tomatoe sauce - melt butter, add a few tomatoes (I used whole canned) to simmer. Just before ready to serve, add 9 oz bag of baby spinach until wilted. To serve - place tomatoe/spinach on bottom of plate, top with halibut and cream sauce. Amazing!

the sauce was just delicious... i used chantrelle and added some parmesan with the chantrelle

A great recipe! Many thanks to earlier reviewers for their suggestions, especially for the tip about using canned, diced tomatoes and for doubling the sauce recipe. Now, a few suggestions of my own. Definitely use basil instead of sorrel - spinach just doesn't have the flavour that's needed. I didn't bother to add the butter, it was rich enough as is. Next time, I will roughly puree the sauce to blend the cream, shallots, basil, and tomatoes more. When I make mashed potatoes, I drain the potatoes from the cooking liquid, but not completely. Then I mash, adding margarine a little at a time until it feels right. No cream or milk is necessary. If it's a little too watery, just let it sit for awhile; the starch will absorb the extra liquid. This makes a light, not too dense or heavy mashed potato. Also, on a hot day, you can poach the fish instead of turning on the oven. The one thing that wasn't clear was the chopping of the mushrooms. I thought that it would be too hard to get them brown that way, not to mention that it wouldn't look well with the zucchini, so I just sliced them. It worked perfectly.

Excellent flavors! I ended up scooping the vegetables out of the cream/butter sauce to save slightly on calories. I would cut back on those ingredients next time because this tastes incredible even without them.

This is truly an exceptional dish. I served it with the Mashed-Potato Casserole with Smoked Gouda and Bacon and it was out of this world.

This dish got rave reviews from ny husband and company. They said it was restaurant quality. Next time I would try to thicken the sauce a bit more.

This is the kind of recipe that will really impress dinner guests and it's not hard. The only thing I changed was using brown rice instead of garlic mashed potatoes but I think it would be even more delicious with the potatoes. I followed one reviewers suggestion of using canned chopped tomatoes...I just drained the juice and through them in instead of fresh. Much less work and still extraordinary!

This was as my husband would say a definite do over! Used half spinach and half arugla in the sauce instead of sorrel.Also halibut was out of season so I used cod. As a previous reviewer said you need to double the sauce. There was only two of us and we ate almost all the sauce. Great presentation.

This is great! A bit time consuming and requires several pots and pans but it is worth it. I used scallops instead of halibut - no complaints!

Absolutely perfect! This recipe turned out wonderful. Evreyone loved the potatoes and vegetables as much as the fish. I'll certainly be making this again.

I have had this recipe in my folder since 1996 and never made it because it seemed too complicated. My husband recently went to Alaska and brought so much halibut, I just had to try it. It was well worth the effort. The only downside is that I dirtied many pans with all the sauces. I would definately make it again. It was a hit!

This was my second time making this dish. I used 1/2 white balsamic vinegar and 1/2 dark aged balsamic vinegar. For the chopped tomatoes , I used a can of petite diced tomatoes. What resulted was a heavenly delicate tomato cream sauce with enough tanginess to compliment the halibut perfectly. Very good recipe.

I made this with flounder for a supper club entree, and everyone raved. It was melt in your mouth delicious. I also made the sauce and veggies with chicken and shrimp for a completely different audience, and again everyone raved. Kids, adults, foodies and rednecks alike loved this dish, so it will become part of my entertaining menu.

We all liked this -it was simple and elegant. I will make it again for a dinner party because the presentation is nice and I love halibut with some sort of tomatoes. It's a good standby recipe for entertaining - but for just my family, I'll be experimenting with some of the other halibut recipes. Notes: I doubled the sauce and didn't add as much butter but found it needed a bit of salt and pepper. Next time I will saute the mushrooms and zucchini separately - otherwise, they all come out steamed instead of browned. The garlic mashed potatoes were great with everything. Used spinach instead of sorrel which was fine although I have never tried sorrel so will try that next time. Will play around with different varieties of summer tomatoes in the future.

I keep reading the recipe over again to see if I missed anything. Loved the halibut over the mashed potatoes. Didn't have a zucchini in the house so made the mushrooms without (and would make them again). I think it was chopping the mushrooms and cooking until just crispy - delicious. My problem was with the sauce. It was just too much on top of all the other flavors. I particularly didn't like the fresh tomato taste in the cream sauce. I like either very fresh tomato or a cooked tomato sauce. Even though I let the vinegar evaporate you could still taste an edge in the cream sauce that I didn't like. I also sliced the spinach very fine instead of chopping but don't think that this could have ruined the dish. My husband didn't finish his plate and agreed that it was just too many different flavors competing.

We made this for New Years Eve dinner this year, we had to subsitute marlin (as the halibut didn't look too great at the fish shop) for the halibut and it was AMAZING. I am making it for company this week and hope to have equally stellar results.

Very good. I think the person that thought it was boring forgot salt & pepper. You can tweak this recipe with very good results. I added fresh basil to the sauce (would try to find sorrel next time), put the sauted mushroom with some fresh cooked spinach and made regular mashed potatoes. This is a great make-ahead recipe except for the fish, even the day before.

Delicious and beautiful on the plate. Served it to company and had everyone scraping the last of it off the plate. Definitely make this dish with the garlic mashed potatoes as recommended and place the fish and sauce on top. Used spinach,as I did not have sorrel, but it did not affect the flavor at all. Would definitely make this again.

I have made this several times and change it up slightly each time. More pepper, less pepper. It's good even with Red Snapper (they were out of helibut that day). Personally, I am not too crazy about the vegetable side,and have made it with steamed green beans which I like better and are easier to prepare. All in all, a fabulous dish.

Really enjoyed this dish, but in the future I would drastically cut down or even eliminate the red pepper with the mushrooms. The mushrooms are excellent tasting as is...and the pepper added unnecessary heat but no flavor.

This recipe is wonderful as is, but is also incredibly adaptable. I have been cooking it since the initial printing in the "Ireland" edition (1996). If halibut cannot be found, try Chilean sea bass (a little richer, but yummy). Insted of potatoes, try rice (mushroom risotto is nice). Instead of the original sauce, sundried tomato and oregano salad dressing with fresh lemon juice is a non-alcoholic alternative. How ever you prepare it, you'll be surprised at how easy and delicious it is.

This is a heavenly dish! It pays to have the highest quality ingredients. Fortunately, I had sorrel in my herb garden (although fresh spinach would be equally good) and I recently discovered a new seafood market where the fish is very fresh. This time I didn't serve with mashed potatoes, as this was part of a multi-course meal. Otherwise, I made no changes in the recipe.

My boyfriend and I absoultely fell in love iwth this recipe, he thinks I'm the best cook in the world now. I couldn't find sorrell so I used the spinach, anyways the amount is so little that I don't think it makes a difference. You've GOT to use halibut, it was just amazing in this recipe. It looked and tasted amazing. We'll definately make it again.

I also found the mashed potatoes blended too much with the halibut and sauce. My halibut had some spines in it so they kinda hid in the potatoes.Intresting, but nothing special.

This dish was truly delicious. A tribute to the great halibut. I used yukon gold potatoes and spinach. Next time I'll try harder to find sorrel, but it seems hard to find. I can't say I know what I am missing because it was delicious with the spinach. The sauce was as much a pleasure to prepare as to eat. The rich aromas of the shallots, vinegar, and wine filled the kitchen. What resulted was a fusion of the three that was mellowed by the cream. The other flavors really complement and enhance the flavor of the halibut. Agree that this is a complete meal to the palette as to the stomach. Fish, starch, and vegetables all covered. One thing, next time I think I will use more mushrooms and perhaps use the porcini type. I would make this for company on a very special occasion, but bring a big appetite. This is rich.

This recipe sounded wonderful, as were the reviews. But the problem I found was that the cream sauce was too rich. My family agreed, and could hardly finish it which surprised me since they usually love rich and creamy. I think I'll give this one another try and use half and half or milk. Beautiful presentation, but simple halibut is great too.

This was very tasty. We made it the first time with spinach because we couldn't find sorrel, but remade it with sorrel and it was much better. The spinach substitution is a good idea but doesn't do the recipe justice.

This is one of the best - just delicious and easy too. I substituted Yukon Gold potatoes. I did not add the butter to the sauce and it was still rich and tasty. Our guests raved about it. I'll definitely do it again.

Thoroughly enjoyed by all. We served the fish over the potatoes and this was a creamy dream, different from the usual presentation. No funky ingredients here so it was perfect for my family. Only thing I would change in the future would be to use creamed baby onions with portabellos rather than zucchini and regular mushrooms around the fish. Note that this dish makes a full plate of food and we didn't feel that it needed anything else to be served with it.

I have made this recipe several times since it was first published in 1996. This is an excellent way to serve a very elegant fish dish. It's one of those recipes that, once tried, you will return to again and again. Very yummy. I have used spinach instead of sorrel with same results.

This was delicious. My husband absolutely loved it. My eyes were bigger that my stomach and he finished up what I couldn't. It has a lot of cream and butter so I won't make it too often for that reason only.
