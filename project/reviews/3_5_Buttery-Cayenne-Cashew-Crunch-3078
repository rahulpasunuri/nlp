I've been making this brittle since 1997 and is a requested favorite from friends, family and everyone in between. It's fabulous when it turns out, timing is everything. Ingredients should be melted slowly, then up the heat to med. high for 5 minutes. I do the ice water test too (it's a no-fail way to know if the brittle is done). When it's made correctly, the cashews crunch, the brittle breaks, and you can't stop eating it! Definitely worth it.

This was very easy to make (although the yield wasn't very big). I'm not a heat lover, so the teaspoon of cayenne was more than enough for me. The candy set nicely, but my cashews were more chewy than crunchy. I wonder if I should have toasted them first, or added them towards the end of cooking.

Wonderful! The salt, heat and sweet create the perfect balance. I cooked mine longer than recommended and used the ice water trick (when you think your brittle is done take a spoonful and dip it in ice water. If it firms up its ready if its still dough like keep cooking).

Came out great! I bumped up the cayenne and cooked for 10 minutes rather than five.I started out on low until butter melted. I tested the brittle in water until it was properly to the consistency of brittle. First attempt I did not cook long enough and did not test in the water. It's great, had to make three more batches at the request of friends.

I wasted time, butter, cashews, on this recipe. Followed it exactly. While the taste is nice, it did not harden like brittle and should not be called a brittle-style candy. It also does not "break" into pieces. It only crumbles into soft dough-like pieces.

I thought this was too easy to be true, but the recipe turned out just great. I've passed on the recipe to several others already.

I followed the directions for this recipe exactly. I was very disappointed by the results. The crunch was not hard enough but more like rubber. I had to throw the batch away. It was too buttery and too sweet for my taste. I will try the cayenne in a traditional brittle recipe using a candy thermometer.

Outstanding!!! I bumped up the cayenne to (1)Tablespoon and it really gave this dish the zing that it needed.
