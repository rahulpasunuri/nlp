This recipe is really great. I made it with fresh blackberries from the farmers market instead of blueberries, and my guess is that blackberries were even better than blueberries! My only complaint is that the whipped cream should have been sweetened and maybe have a little vanilla added. Otherwise it was a great recipe.

I've been making this since 97. This one is a keeper. Instead of small individual servings as suggested, I use a trfle dish. It looks great and guests take as much as they want. My friends ask for this one often. A wonderful, light summer desert...

I omitted the cream, used rasberries instead and added extra gelatine. It was so yum, except the sugar mixed with the coconut was kinda crunchy and ruined the texture I thought.

I have made this for guests time and time again with rave reviews. It is fairly easy to make with an amazing presentation and light taste.

Simple to make dessert. Tartness of lemon is s good foil for sweetness of bluberries. I added a bit of mexican vanilla to the whipped cream. I got 5 (rather generous) servings.

Absolutely love this dish. I did not find it too sweet. In fact, the first time I made it I thought the whipped cream needed a little sweetener, as the lemon is so tangy. It does make more like 6 servings. I also added strawberries to the blueberries which makes for a nice color.

Good tasting, but too sweet for me and too runny: more the consistency of a pastry cream than a mousse.

I thought this dessert was good but a little too sweet. As the previous reviewer said, the recipe really only makes 6 portions.

This Mousse is wonderfully lemony, but a little sweet. I would leave out the brown sugar, the toasted cocoanut is enough. I would add more gelatin, not quite stiff enough for me. Very pretty served in crystal wine glasses. Can't wait to make your seafood lasagne this weekend. I'll let you know!!

Very delicious recipe. The recipe didn't make enough to layer 3 tablespoons twice into each of 8 goblets, so I made 6 large portions. Next time I will layer 2 tablespoons of each layer to make 8 servings.

I thought this was a very good recipe-- I omitted the coconut and it tasted fine without it, too. It was delicious and cool, a compliment to a full dinner on a warm summer evening. I have made this three times and have gotten raves from it each time.
