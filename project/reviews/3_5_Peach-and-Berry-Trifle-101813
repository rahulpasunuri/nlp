We will definitely make this again. The lady fingers we used were from the boxed cookie section. They were a bit crisp which add a nice crunch. We served an extra cookie with each helping for something to dip. We served this in November so we ended up using frozen peaches. I let them defrost in a colander for a couple hours and then used them. Frozen worked perfectly. They had the same crunch as a fresh peach and no annoying slime. I will definitely make this again. I would love some tips on keeping the layers a little cleaner. I struggled.

I've made this three times for three separate events and it has gotten rave reviews each time. It is amazingly fresh and light and just yummy.. I added twice the vanilla and you must use very ripe fruit that is in season. That is what makes it great..

Tastes like a a fruit compote and a cream cake put together. Too much fruit. Nothing extarordinary.

Easy to make but not too spectacular

My husband and I had his parents over for Fathers' Day last year, and I made this trifle. I only modified the peach and berries ratio. It was beautiful in the clear crystal bowl, and it was drop dead delicious!!! My father-in-law had more than one heaping helping, and I discovered then that his favorite dessert is strawberries and cream. With pleasure, I am going to make it this week end for Mothers' Day!

Made this dish for a gathering and got many compliments, even though it was a bit soggy because it sat for over 6 hours. I used mangoes instead of peaches and next time I'm gonna try it with the custard. Easy to make, beautiful presentation, and good.

I used peaches and blueberries, both of which were in season, and the results were amazing. I also made one layer using one package of instant vanilla pudding. One guest commented that his English granny used to make great trifle when he was young and that this one was 'on par' - very high praise, as people are always partial to their mothers/grandmother's versions of things!

Beautiful presentation. I made it for Passover, using passover ladyfingers. I used strawberrys and raspberrys and pure raspberry jam. It looked wonderful and was a huge hit, especially with the children. It would be nice with a liquor, but I knew the kids would never try it. A nice, easy and great looking dessert.

This was a great and easy recipe. peaches were out of season so I used mangoes which were fine. I did add sugar to the whip cream, otherwise the cream can be a bit flavorless (I've had this problem with other trifle recipes).

This was an excellent recipe for a first-timer trifle maker--everyone raved about it, despite the fact that there were an array of other tempting desserts. I used blackberries, strawberries and white peaches, and seedless raspberry fruit spread instead of jam. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent, easy, pretty... but too good if you are trying to diet. Use the soft lady fingers... not the crunchy ones.

This was just INCREDIBLE! Its gorgeous, easy (the only thing that takes some time is whipping the whipping cream). Its fun to make the layers too. I used store bought angel food cake and sliced it thinly; then used Dickenson's rasberry, fruit, cream for first layer; then repeated for the second layer but added one prepared package of Birds custard for the middle (between the jam and the fruit); for the 3rd layer, I used angel food cake, jam and topped it off with the beautiful berries (I didn't use the third whipping cream layer). Everybody raves at how great it looks and always asks for the recipe!!

This was a delicious recipe but did not taste like a trifle. It was like a strawberry shortcake with other fruits mixed inside. I prefer fresh fruit with the homemade whipped cream as opposed to this.

We made this for our Fourth of July picnic and it was a big hit. I made a few substitutions...used chunks of angel food cake instead of ladyfingers, and used peaches, strawberries and blueberries for the fruit (a bit more patriotic looking) Easy and delicious!

I took this dish to a pot luck last evening and received a round of applause! I used 6 cups of mixed fresh fruit: strawberries, blueberries, peach,and mango that I strained before adding to the bowl. One pkg. of Bird's custard wasn't enough so I did my first layer with the custard, the second with a jar of St.Dalfour 4 Fruits jam and the third with a container of low fat raspberry yoghurt. Garnished the top of the trifle with fresh raspberries. I NEVER make desserts but this was just too much of a crowd pleaser not to do again.

I made this delicious trifle for a party this past Saturday and received rave reviews. I used Spring frozen Jersey strawberries, local large blackberries, peaches and blueberries. Also added bananas. I did use two packages of Bird's custard added on top of the fruit layer and under the cream layer. It was sooo yummy. Definately will make again and again. And so easy to make too.

This was a wonderful dessert. Will make it again this next summer. Everyone loved it.

May I suggest adding a little cream sherry to the lady fingers, forget the jam, and use custard instead. (Bird's Brand, easy to make) I still used whipped cream but added some Amaretto to the whipped cream and it was yummy.

We made this dessert for a pool party and it was greeted with RAVE reviews (including from one guest who owns a restaurant and is an excellent chef).
