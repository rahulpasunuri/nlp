This soup was a homerun for me. Made recipe exactly as written--but used chicken stock instead of fish. I was looking for a light, kind of flavorful brothy soup for a first course--and this is it. LOTS of work involved: 2 sauce pans, blender, 3 bowls, strainer, chopping, flames! But it's worth the effort if you want to wow someone with unique flavors. I would make again for entertaining.

I absolutely cheated with this one but there's a quick and easy way to turn this rich and flavourful soup into an "any nite" meal. I used home-made frozen chicken stock (gasp) and proceeded as directed. It was REALLY delicious and by cutting out the stock step, it's quick and easy. Next time, I may stir in a tin of crab meat for variety. I think this soup would really impress guests...

I've made this several times and it is delicious and deep in shrimp flavor. I prefer not to strain pureed shrimp through a sieve; I like the texture of the small shreds of shrimp in the soup.

I made this soup for Dinner Club last Saturday and it was FABULOUS! I made it exactly as written and served it as suggested. Definitely a keeper! I used my immersion blender to purée the soup but did not bother to strain.

I make this soup every Thanksgiving by overwhelming request... one change is that I keep all of the shrimp in and just puree it to death so it's more of a bisque. It's a bit labor-intensive, but sooo worth it!

Very disappointing. I ended up throwing half of the soup away because nobody wanted to eat it. I make several recipes from this website each week and have never before rated anything one fork.

I have made this twice. Both times is has been good, but messy. It could use some more texture, I have been reserving more shrimp, but will also try more tomatoes as well. I have never been able to set the pan on fire. Does anyone have any tips on how to do this.

I feel this dish was a bit complicated for the results. I used extra shrimp shells, about double what I got from the shrimp that went into it, to creat a more pronounced shrimp flavor. Also, I suggest reserving some of the diced tomatoes and adding them at end for a nice textural and temperature counterpoint to the creamy, warm soup.

A fabulous soup. My husband thought it was a bit spicy but I thought it was perfect, I'll definitely make it again. For convenience, I used pre-cooked and cleaned shrimp with the tails left on, I made the stock from the shrimp tails but skipped the flaming saucepan step. I tasted great and I didn't miss the mess.

this was ok for a change of pace but doubt i will make it again soon. it's quite messy to make & certainly not worth the time it took.

This recipe was just O.K. The flavors just didn't POP like I was hoping. As an afterthought, it might have improved with the use of sherry in place of the brandy. I'll save my shrimp for something better.

This is in response to Betsy from Seattle: I believe "Tagide" is the region in Portugal along the Tagus River ("Tajo" in Portugese). The river flows to the Atlantic, and Lisbon is situated at the mouth of the river. Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure. Regardless, this soup is great, a definite keeper. :-) MCW

I made this late last evening for company today. This is absolutely delicious. Had to sub sherry for the brandy. Definitely will be one of the first soup recipes I turn to.

This is an elegant, rich soup. Who, what or where is Tagide?

Lordy, Lordy!! You guys need to push this recipe to the forward of your website. I cook from here often and this is THE BEST!! I will repeat this recipe many times. I always try the recipe exactly according to instructions (for example, I didn't substitute skim milk for whipping cream, or olestra for the butter)then modify later. This one I won't modify.....Absolutely fabulous! And great for low carb diets, believe it or not!

This is an amazing soup. It is indeed rich and filling, but it's to be savored in moderate doses. The recipe is fun to make and I absolutely concur that no modifications are needed. I tried the toasted baguette slices and they were a great complement. My stepdad looked at me and said with wonder, "Where did you learn to cook??" ... Nice. ;)

This was a wonderful bisque. No modifications are needed. I served it with crouton made with baguette slices brushed with olive oil and garlic toasted in a 350 oven for about 5-10 minutes. It was a great hit as a first course for my Easter sunday supper.
