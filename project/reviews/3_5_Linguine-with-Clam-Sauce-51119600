Adding chopped black olives and grated parmesean cheese would put it over the top.

I love clams & linguine! I take a little care when cooking the clams to make sure the sand & grit settles to the bottom of whatever pan I've opened them in so as not to get much grit in the meal. I think that makes it so much better.
