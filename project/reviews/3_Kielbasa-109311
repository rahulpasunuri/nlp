I went out on a limb and tried this with the America's favorite tube-meat, a hot dog... it went GREAT! I shook things up by using relish and mustard. I'll try onions next time.

This should NOT be made with smoked "Polish sausage," it should be made the right way, with fresh kielbasa (NOT the same thing). Seek out fresh Polish/kielbasa, add some caraway to the water, simmer it on low heat for about 1 hour and serve with grainy mustard and horseradish.

I finally was able to gather all the ingredients together, but after I cooked it I forgot the final step and I accidentally cut the pieces horizontally. I will try this again and use the traditional method of diagonal slicing.

Good recipe! I simmered the kielbasa in beer, I think it adds a little. And it smells good. The reviews for this recipe are amazing--so bizarre and hilarious. I particularly like the strange Russian woman ("kedicik" from Ukraine) who has convinced herself that the recipe creator doesn't recognize any slavik nations other than Russia. I didn't pick up on that. Maybe it's because I'm not Russian and I just don't understand.

This is one of the occasions when a recipe makes me giggle non-stop... I am part Russian, part Polish, part Ukrainian, living in Ukraine, and I know no one who BOILS -mind it - SMOKED - sausage in Ukraine or Russia. The traditional dish calls for a home-made sausage that is then fried....Easter bread recipe is a complete nonsense, and it does not look like that either, but the best part of it is asparagus.. I love asparagus.... but believe me, it is NOT Russian tradition, not to mention Easter food:-)))) P.S. - it's actually KOLBASA....kielbasa is rather Polish... I wish some authors actually realised that there are many Slavic nations over her, not just Russians:-)))))

So there we were in the middle of nowhere with nothing but 4 bottles of Dasani, 1 kielbasa and a hot pot...thanks epicurious!

Being of Polish extraction myself I felt motivated to try this new method of cooking our favored tube-meat; the French inspired, though costly, was by far the best preparation. My dear departed Babcia, however, would not have agreed with the "prick" part, she preferred to prick her kielbasa a'table so that the boiling juice squirted all over. MMMGood!

I've added a french twist to this recipe by boiling in Evian. it really adds a certain je ne sais quoi. for a german flair i drink several weiss beers and prepare only half of the kielbasa stuffing the other half into my lederhosen.

well, ok, it's a good project for an experienced female cook. but what about us single guys? It it appealing, but just too complicated. tending to it for that much time really interferes with trips to the fridge for that great canadian beer. I got so involved with the beer that i forgot to keep the skillet half full of water! How about some good microwave pizza recipes?

Histarical. That is why this recipe gets four forks. I stumble onto this recipe once in a while and end up laughing reading all the reviews. To defend Gourmet, it does make sense as part of the overall theme.

the technique is tricky, the ingredients obscure, but the result is sublime. I substituted organic niman ranch kielbasa and evian - what a difference!!!

I didn't have any kielbasa so I used hot dogs:)

Great flavor! But I used 1 1/2 lb kielbasa, only 1/3 cup water, pierced it 2 1/2 times, and simmered in a 14 inch light skillet. I covered it all the way, over high heat until still just a little bit cool, about 4 1/2 minutes (check after 2 minutes to make sure it is still cold). I transferred kielbasa with a fork (never tongs) onto a plastic plate and cut vertically into 1 inch pieces. I served immmediately! Wonderful!!

Hey, as a Canadian, I take offense to the wise crack about our beer. Now, while Molson & Kokanee is not ever in my refrigerator, we have some of the best micro-brews in the world...anyways, had to put that out there, go back and sip your Bud! :)

I have talked to many young brides who would like to cook at home but they have never received ANY training. They look at Kielbasa in the grocery store and say "what is that?" and "How do you cook it?" I refer many of them to this site. It is nice to know there is something here for everyone.

Put kielbasa on "Russian Easter bread" (controversial recipe on this site), add 13 different Eastern European nationalities and then discuss both for the rest of the day

My family is of Polish origin and we have Kielbasa for Easter every year. A few notes: if your Kielbasa is bland after this method of cooking, it is because you bought poor quality Kielbasa, not because of the recipe. This is, as far as our family can remember, the traditional method of cooking Kielbasa, and I applaud Gourmet for promoting tradiation. For those of us in the younger generations who are preparing our own Easter celebration for the first time, its nice to have access to traditional recipes as well as more modern recipes.

Substitute a can of Canadian beer for the water. Finally, a good use for Canadian beer!

I have enjoyed the comments too. I thought it was a tad wierd to be here, however I also noticed that this recipe was included as just part of Gourmet.com 's issue: "In Russian Orthodox tradition, Easter is a joyous breaking of the Lenten fast. This feast lasts for hours and makes the air fragrant with roasted meats, vegetables, and saffron-laced breads." Viewed in that light as opposed to a stand alone recipe, well it makes sense. And it does stand for a method of cooking the sausage. Check it out: http://eat.epicurious.com/gourmet/menus/?/gourmet/menus/russian_easter.html ---I sure as heck would not stop the comments. Cooking is fun.

I used hot dogs in my version of this recipe. Everyone wanted seconds! Plus the leftover hotdog water made for a refreshing drink mixed with a little cranberry juice. Wonderfull! four forks.

Hey! This is great as written, but I had to add my own ideas. Saute sliced kielbasa in a skillet. Add sliced potatoes, carrots & onions & a bit of garlic. Cook until potatoes are tender. :) It's comfort food for a quick meal!

A Cook From virginia: As written, the recipe is bland. But trythis to "kick it up a notch". Preheat oven to 350. Gently poach kielbasa in simmering water for 15 minutes. Put kielbasa on baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes or until skin is crackling and just beginning brown. Serve with a variety of mustards and regular or beet horseradish. Delicious.

I tried to make this last night, but I was stumped half way through. It says "check after 15 minutes and add a little more water if skillet is almost dry". Mine was TOTALLY dry, so I didn't add any water. It was terrible. Are all of these recipes written for professional chefs, with no thought for the average cook!

Believe it or not, I know people who make ALL sausage this way; including breakfast sausage and bratwurst. I hope this was a joke; why wouldn't Gourmet tell you to grill the sausage; not as if there would be many more steps. The rest of the reviewers made me laugh; thanks.

Kielbasa is a favorite of mine. It ranks right up there with most other April Fools jokes. OK people, relax just a bit and enjoy life.

I had always used 2 cups of water to boil my kielbasa and it never tasted right. Thank goodness I found this recipe. I can't wait to try it with 1 cup of water.

My mother used to make Kielbasa this way. This is a woman who bless her, thought prego and uncle ben's could equal spanish rice. I hated all sausage till I discovered the joys of grilling.

I think there's a serious omission in this recipe, as some novice cooks might end up with pieces of plastic in their finished dish. Why did they omit the step about removing the kielbasa from the package? Yes, of course I'm kidding, but geez......yet another set of package directions posing as a recipe. Too much of this from Gourmet lately.

Plastic? We don't need no stinkin' plastic. I get my kielbasa wrapped in butcher paper from my local Polish deli.
