Wow -- the worcestershire and balsamic go a long way in giving this tried and true summer favorite an extra kick of flavor. To make preparation a little quicker, I sliced the onions, put them in a 9 x 13 aluminum pan (the throw away kind), tossed in a little olive oil, then grilled them right in the pan on medium to medium- high heat on a closed grill. Of course, you have to stir them once in a while. (This is a simple way to cook certain veggies on the grill, like sliced carrots and asparagus. ) Enjoyed this dish very much.

We made this last night.We wanted to get the review down while we were all here. We all thought it was GREAT the flavor was better then we thought it would be.We used three kinds of sausages hot & sweet Italian and also chicken with sun dried tomato. The peppers and onions had the grill marks and great taste with the Worcestershire and Balsamic. It is already in my recipe box and it will be the only way to make Sausage peppers and onions in our house. Can't wait to make it for friends when we go camping next month.

Great weeknight or casual party dinner recipe. I love the amount of peppers and onions. I actually sauteed (too cold to grill) them and they caramelized a little. I then added the Balsamic and Worcestershire. I also sauteed the sausage - oh so good! Served it with a simple salad.

I also made this in the grill pan and it turned out great. Added some provolone cheese to the roll and smeared with stone ground mustard. Very tasty!

Grilling this classic combo makes it even better. It really brings out the flavor of the peppers and onion. My only addition was to add cheese to the finished rolls.

A great summer dish. Used andouille sausage and added S&P to onions and peppers. Cooked everything in a grill pan, and it was fantastic!

If you don`t want to grill these outside, you can use a large grill pan on the top of the stove, cooking on med-med. high. Add 1 1/2 teas. Liquid Smoke before cooking. Delicious!

I made this with Bratwurst and it was very tasty. We especially liked the Worcestershire and Balsamic Vinegar added to the pepper and onions. It gave a great flavor to the mixture.

I have always loved the sausaage, pepper and onion combination. I'm without a grill right now but I guess I could try it another way.
