This is a FAVORITE!! Our ground lamb comes in 1# packages, but other than a little less meat & a titch more balsamic vinegar, we don't change a thing!

These burgers should be on the Epicurious's list of best burgers. Hands down. My boyfriend, who is rarely enthusiastic about food, was going crazy over them. They are SO delicious and easy! Plus, they didn't break the bank like I thought they would. I went a little easy on the mint since my bf said he didn't like it. & I cut my red onion as thinly as I possibly could. Also, just used a cup of Feta. All worked out perfectly. Will definitely be keeping this in my weeknight repertoire!

I made the entire "Go Greek" menu for dinner. Fabulous. The flavor of the burger was spot on, and when paired with the spinach salad, just heavenly. I would definitely make again!

I made this recipe for a large group of my friends at a cottage barbeque. I quadrupled the recipe. The burgers got great reviews (I'm a vegetarian, so I can only report the reviews I got from the others). The burgers turned out juicy and well seasoned. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used arugula instead of spinach. One of my friends told me that I was ruining all other burgers for her by making these, so it is defitely a recipe that I would use again.

We thought this was ok. Really all I could taste was red onion and feta. I probably won't make this again

Fresh, different and so delicious! Ground my own lamb with a lean cut of tenderloin. Other than that, made it pretty much as written, except used arugula for the salad. I made extra salad and served it on the side with roasted wedge potatoes. Really great!

Wow!!! These were really wonderful and very simple to make. The spinach salad was excellent on the burgers. I didn't have any red onion so I omitted it, but look forward to adding it next time. I had some leftover spinach salad and tossed in some dried cranberries and croutons and served on the side. Will make again.

Really good, fresh taste and easy to make. We served it with roasted beets, which went great with the greek salad flavors on the burgers.

This dish is quite simple. Something you could easily throw together in a handful of minutes if you had the right ingredients. Lamb burgers were well seasoned and the spinach salad with feta was a great match for the lamb.

These were great! I was a little concerned about the lack of "condiments" but the vinegar in the spinach salad really made the flavor of the spinach, onion and feta stand out. Served it with an heirloom tomato salad from the garden.

I have these burgers many, many times with rav reviews. Sometimes I use argula instead of spinach, very yummy!

These were fabulous and easy! Followed advice below and made the roasted potato wedges with cilantro lime dipping sauce - also fabulous!

Made these for my girlfriend and we absolutely loved them! We had them with Roasted Potato Wedges with Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise (Search the site) and they accompanied these perfectly. Sam

My husband made these burgers this evening. The were absolutely scrumptious! He followed the recipe, except the store was out of mint and the paprika was the Hungarian, hot variety. It gave the burgers just the right amount of spicy heat. We will definitely make again and will try with the mint. Also, in addition to the salad, I added with Dijon mustard and accompanied it with my favorite Belgium beer!!

Delicious and fast. Great for nights when you need a quick meal. VERY moist and flavorful. Everyone in the house loved them.

I loved these burgers! I followed everything exactly, but I lowered the cooking temp. The meat was delicious, and the dressed salad was the perfect topper. Yum!

hmmmm, this wasn't bad but I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I followed the recipe exactly. The mint and cinnamon are definite plusses, but it certainly wasn't exciting. Easy, yes. We served them on lovely francese rolls and well, found them sort of ho hum.

Made this just as directed and it was amazing. Made small burgers and served them on fluffy potato rolls. Yum!

None of us liked the cinnamon in this. Loved the Spinach and onion salad on top and an easy weeknight dinner but won't make again.

I'm making this again tonight - it was excellent the first time exactly as written. I was a little leery of the fresh mint - but it was perfect! Even my pickiest eater loved it.

I am not a big lamb lover, but I have to admit these burgers were delicious. The seasonings were perfect especially the fresh mint. I will definitely make them again

I'm a busy Mom, and I am always looking for easy weeknight dinners. I made this recipe, using mint flakes, as I didn't have fresh mint on hand. The results were fantastic. I added kalamata olives and a bit more balsamic to the dressing. My husband LOVED this burger. I am definitely making this again.

Turned out excellent --- juicy and flavorful. Served on fresh kaiser rolls and made the spanakopita and greek salad from this site to go with it.

My 16 year old son ripped this recipe out of the magazine, and said, "Please make this Mom!" It was definitely worth it. We stayed true to the recipe, except we added some cinnamon sugar, instead of , plain sugar, because that was all we had. We also spread a thin layer of Greek Yogurt flovored with a little dill on the bun. Tzatziki(sp?) would also taste great. My husband, Tim who is a chef, thought our additions improved a potentially dry burger. We also grilled the burgers outside. Yum!! Thanks for the great recipe. Christiane Hopkins Timothy S.

Loved this burger! Smells so good when cooking it. This has become a staple in my menu.

Quick, easy, delicious, and a meal in itself. Definitely a keeper!

My family and fiends absolutely love these! I have adjusted the recipe a bit, by incorporating some of the spinach and feta into the burgers themselves. The burger mixture can be made several hours ahead, which only increases the flavors. We have also tried them on the grill, which works especially well.

I used lean sirloin in place of ground lamb as the store was out that day, but otherwise followed the recipe directly with great results. My boyfriend and I also ate most of the "salad" on the side. Served with the quinoa tabbouleh from this site.

These turned out great! They were very easy to make. I went a little light on the mint which was a good call, it was a strong flavor. Also, topping the burgers with a "salad" didn't work out too well, everything fell off. I would wrap them in waxed paper, fast-food style, to eat, or just top them with a layer of feta, then spinach, then an onion ring. Served it with red bell peppers and hummus on the side, boyfriend loved it and so did I.

this is delicious. my boyfriend the meatlover especially loved it! i would definitely make this again.

This is a fantastic meal. The burgers are juicy and ultra fragrant from the spices and mint. I make extra spinach topping and serve it as a side. Add chopped greek olives, cucumber and red bell pepper to make it a heartier greek salad. This is fast and easy, an excellent weeknight meal. I will make it again and again.

I think these are my fave new recipe - what a great combo - and so fast and easy! Yum!!!

The cinnamon was fragrant and delicious. Added a wee dab of greek yogurt to the burger topping mix to make it somewhat more cohesive - will do this recipe again!

I used this recipe as inspiration for lamb meatloaf, and it turned out very good. I mixed frozen spinach, onion, the spices and feta cheese called for in the recipe into ground lamb. Plus an egg and bread crumbs.

Made on a Big Green Egg grill/cooker. Hand ground the lamb with the spices. It was good but not great.

I liked the smell of the mint as the burgers were on the grill. The ciabatta rolls tended to be a bit dry and could have benefited from some butter and garlic prior to the broiler. The meat really does need to be 3/4in thick to counter the immense bun.
