My family and I thought this was pretty good. Not bad for leftover Christmas turkey. And if you're really using leftovers from the holidays, try this side dish from Cooking Light: stuff halved poblano chilies with mashed potatoes, top with Monterey Jack cheese, and bake at 325 until tender. Top it all off with margaritas and you've got a quick and tasty post-holiday meal.

I didn't make individual stacks, I put the tortillas in a 9x13 pan after I dipped them in the sauce. It was easier to make - just dump on the beans, tortilla layer, dump in the turkey, etc. I only made three layers but a deeper dish could have had four. My son said "hey mom, this is pretty good." so I'll keep the recipe. I was looking for something fast and uncomplicated for a family dinner + lunch leftovers for me. This works.

I really didn't care for this dish. The turkey was bland. On the contrary, the beans with chipotles was too spicy. Also, the corn tortillas didn't really go with the flavors in this dish. That may just be my preference.

Too heavy versus a tradional enchiladas suiza

I was disappointed in this. I have had turkey enchiladas that were very tasty and this was a let down. I didn't like the chipotle in the beans; the flavor was bad and too spicy. We threw most of it away.

I agree with previous reviewer. The turkey layer was a little bland, leaving your tastebuds somewhat confused. In hindsight I might have soaked the turkey meat in the enchilada sauce first to make sure the flavors were more consistent throughout the dish. I like refried beans better with crispy corn tortillas so I think I would also just use whole beans with chipotle instead. Muy spicy!

This was awesome. I've made it twice so far. I added more of the chipotle to the beans but I'm obsessed with chipotle. Great recipe and so much easier than traditional enchiladas.

I rarely make Tex-Mex dishes with poultry, and now I know why. The turkey was so bland! I am used to putting some type of seasoned beef in my tacos and enchiladas, so this was disappointing this time. Next time I will definitely spice up the turkey with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, and chili powder!

This was unbelieveable. Even better the second day.
