The sauce is four forks, but the filling is a three, or 2. I dont see why it needs the breadcrumbs. The ravioli/angolotti came out very dense and heavy. Next time I will leave the breadcrumbs out and maybe add parmesan cheese to bring out the nuttiness of the fava beans. I blanched the beans to peel them too.

Agnolotti are a stuffed pasta. That picture ain't no agnolotti! Hello, Epi-Editing Dept.!

I have no idea what agnolotti is, but in the photo it looks suspiciously like some sort of nut bread!

This was excellent; yes, it takes time to complete the recipe, but I made the dough and shaped the agnolotti the day before the dinner I was cooking, froze them, and on the actually day only had to put together the sauce. People literally licked their plates; I mean, they picked them up and lapped the last bits of the sauce, it was so good (and no, they're not the kind of people that would normally behave like this). In my opinion, it is not necessary to peel the beans before cooking them: half-way through that I gave up and cooked half the beans with the peels on, and didn't notice any difference between the two batches (blanching the beans makes them incredibly easier to peel). Otherwise, i followed the recipe religiously, and have since ordered the "French Laundry Cookbook".

Look, there's no doubt it takes time to shell and peel fava beans, but it's worth it for a special occasion. And, now that I know how to make agnolotti, I'm thinking about more and more things to pipe into them! This is much easier and faster than ravioli. People loved the curry sauce. I used Penzey's curry powder -- the one with saffron. My only problem was, I ended up using all the pasta, not 1/2 as the recipe specifies. Oh well...

My dinner guests were wowed with this exquisite and delicious dish. It sounded time-consuming to make (ala Thomas Keller), but was really easy. The flavor of the fava beans is balanced nicely with the curry sauce. Will repeat often!!

Why do fava beans make me think of Hannibal Lector?
