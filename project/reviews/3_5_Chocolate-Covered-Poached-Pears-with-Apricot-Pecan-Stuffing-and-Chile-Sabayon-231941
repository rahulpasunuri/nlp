This is a dairy dessert as part of a meat meal. For Passover, this is unacceptable and misleading. As a reminder, Passover is not just a fun meal - it is a religious observance. Dairy cannot be eaten within 3-6 hours after meat.

Not having made the recipe, I want to note that this is a dairy dessert that is part of a passover menu that includes meat. Generally, one would prepare a parve dessert for a meat meal, because the dessert otherwise could not be eaten for 3-6 hours after the meal. This should have been mentioned in the menu intro.

This is a wonderful recipe. Do not discard the remaining liquid, as suggested in the recipe. Remove pears and reduce the liquid to about 1/2 cup (takes an hour or two). This wonderful thick wine and spice reduction can then be served over a pork dish, such as roasted pork tenderloin.

My pears needed a little longer - I might make an extra test pear next time I poach just to make sure the fruit is in actual fact tender. While the recipe might *look* fiddly, it is in fact incredibly easy - there's not much you can mess up if you follow the instructions to a t. You can even make everything but the sauce the night before - always a plus if you're juggling three courses. And the results are elegant and delicious.

I added pistachios to the stuffing. Everyone I mean everyone, licked their plates clean. This will be made again.

Time consuming but worth every moment. Very elegant in presentation and taste.

This makes a very glamorous dessert presentation, well worth the effort. I did not make the sabayon in the recipe, however, as I was feeding notoriously picky eaters, so instead I substituted french vanilla pudding, and it was delicious with the pears.

This dessert is sophisticated, beautiful and delicous. The chile is just the right amount. Will definitely make again. Had rave reviews at my dinner party for 8 and 2 people asked for the recipe. I melted the chocolate and butter in a measuring cup and it was the perfect size for dipping the pears. I too reduced the sauce and drizzled some on fresh strawberries and raspberries topped with the left-over stuffing for dessert another day.

AMAZING! i did cut the amount of sugar used by half, and used bosch pears. for the stuffing i used no sugar, and added dried crannberries. once your poaching liquid is done with, DO NOT THROW IT AWAY! i reduced it to 1 cup, and used it 4 plating pears together with the sabayon. for the sabayon i used brandy, and added vanilla chai to dilute it.

To: A Cook from Los Angeles: Did you make any of the oher recipes in the menu?

The instructions were unnecessarily fussy (canela would be nice, but cinnamon was fine) and like most restaurant radaptations, have more steps than a home cook might want to bother with, but it made a fine dessert.
