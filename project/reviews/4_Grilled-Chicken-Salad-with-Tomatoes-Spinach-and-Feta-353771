Delicious summer salad, easy, healthy, in season! Always a fan of tomato-feta-fresh oregano combined, this is a new favorite. Followed exactly except for using plain feta with fresh herbs and good evoo. This will be a standard in our house!

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and next time I think I'll put some fresh chopped rosemary on them. I had no idea I was going to go bonkers on the fresh oregano & feta in the tomatoes and it was mostly the oregano. Seriously this mixture was delicious. I kept sneaking big spoonfuls out of the fridge. This is so easy that next time I'd like to complicate it more and make my own marinated feta mixture. Jaime Oliver has this one - red pepper flakes, dried oregano, bay leaf, dried thyme, dried basil, cracked pepper, & fennel seed - pat cheese dry and coat with spices put in a jar and cover with olive oil will keep in fridge for 4 months! I love this salad!

Served this last night for dinner....big hit! Next time I'll add a little lemon to the oil,less tomatoes and more spinach. Beautiful presentation on white platter.

Made this for my book group and it was a hit. I couldn't find feta in oil so I bought 8oz block of feta and cubed it. Used Boar's Head herb/oil in place of the drained oil. I pounded the breasts a little bit to have a uniform thickness for even grilling. Easy to prep ahead and tasty for summer.

This salad was very easy to prepare and yielded flavorful, delicious results. I didn't use nearly as many tomatoes (not a big fan), and it still turned out great.
