This is a great recipe - try adding cumin & garam masala as couscous is cooking. I also added golden raisens & almonds. PIstachios would be great too.

While I am sure this is delicious, it is NOT vegetarian. It is listed as part of the "Exotic Vegetarian Dinner"-I subsitiuted vegetable broth and it was good, but it should not be lsited as part of a vegetariuan meal as written

Very good - pairs well with the Slow Cooked Moroccan Lamb recipe recommended below. I like to use Israeli couscous (look for it in the Kosher section of your supermarket). The grains are larger, similar to acini de pepe pasta. I think the finer grained couscous tends to get mushy. Also added lemon zest and extra juice on advice of others. Can't have too much lemon or herbs in this dish.

Use Trader Joe's Harvest Grains Blend which has Couscous, Orzo, Baby Garbanzo Beans and Red Quinoa - worked well. Did not have basil, so used fresh marjoram, mint and cilantro. Served with Slow Cooked Morocaan Lamb.

Second time i made this dish and this time i added more herbs, lemon juice and olive oil (as in quantity) and it made a great difference. This is a really easy and quick dish to make, even my 2 year old loved it.

Great side dish. You can play with the herbs you use to better complement whatever you're serving it with. And to the cook whose couscous came out soggy, try using equal parts water and couscous. It will always come out fluffy.

From the first time I made this everyone has loved it. I do usually increase the mint to 1/2 cup as that is my favorite herb. This is a regularly made dish in our house now.

Outstanding, we served it with grilled butterflied leg of lamb with lemon dressing. I did add the zest of one lemon to the herb mix, and I think it needed it. I was conscious of the comment to add more salt, and I decided not to add it, and I did not find the dish lacking for leaving it out

This was a bland dish! And mushy too, but it might have been the couscous I used. Italian instead of French, whiter and softer. Definitely needed more olive oil and onion and the idea of the pickled lemon was a good one.

great recipe, simple, fast, and goes great with everything. Exchanged the mint for oregano since I didn't have mint. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delightfull with Thai green curry shrimps. I also mixed in grated lemon peel, raisins and cashew nuts.

Is wonderful. Had left over the next day and needed to add the herbs and the lemon juice again: Is best to eat it all the same day:

I made this as a side dish to the Morocan Slow-Cooked Lamb, and it was the perfect accompaniment. Pair it with something spicy and flavorful. The herbs and lemon add nice fresh flavors to otherwise plain old couscous.

We liked the dish. Some reviewers have commented on "blandness" of dish. We added preserved lemon to the dish and that added a nice flavor kick.

Yummy! I doubled the recipe with the following modifications: I use a tomato basil couscous (use it for the color, the flavor is nonexistent). I substituted the water and used all chicken broth. Added a can of diced (drained) tomatoes with the uncooked couscous. I only had basil and parsley, so omitted the mint and added the juice of 1 whole lemon plus the zest. Fabulous version of couscous and so quick and easy!

After reading other's reviews that it was a bit bland, I too used the juice & the zest of a whole lemon. Didn't have mint, but substituted fresh oregano from my garden, and used all chicken broth for the liquid instead of part water. In the end, it was delicious, and will make it again.

I thought this dish sounded delicious, but it was so bland. I ended up adding the juice of a whole lemon and some lemon zest too but still really couldn't taste it. The onions and garlic disappeared as well. This needs a zingier dressing! I wouldn't make this again without some serious ingredient modification!

I served this with Mahimahi with Onion, Lemon, and Capers (from this site), and it was perfect - light, easy, and delicious. I used more herbs than were called for, and added lemon zest, salt, and pepper. A great, versatile recipe!

Fantastic!! Serve it under the Chile Glazed Salmon, also from this site. A great mix of flavors.

I had no couscous at hand and made this with quinoa. The taste was bright and summery. I used it to accompany grilled lamb kebabs that had been simply but lenghtily marinated in olive oil, honey, lemon, wine, salt&pepper, and fresh mint. I added wine to the marinade and reduced it to a sauce to pour over the quinoa and lamb. Delicious.

I found the dish rather plain, but I added some minced raisins (golden and regular) and a few chopped almonds. Good base dish to use as a shoehorn to add your own ingredients.

great dish!! i added a few things to round it out. diced red bell pepper, sun dried tomatoes, and black olives. using fresh herbs is an absolute must. this dish would be very bland if dried herbs are used. served it with grilled artichokes and pork chops.

Fabulous! I served it as a side to moussaka, yummy! I didn't add any salt, it didn't need any. I will be making this couscous recipe over and over again this summer!

I would definitely make this again and again. In fact, I did just that last summer. I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I add a bit of kosher salt.

Very simple recipe that I've made several times. The only suggestion is that it really needs salt. I'm not one to add salt to recipes very often, but this one definitely needs it. Other than that, it's delicious.

This was my first attempt at couscous and i was really quite pleased with it. However, I added an entire granny smith apple cut into small pieces. i think it gave it just the right kick.

I made this because my children love couscous, but I find that many recipes are too strongly flavored for them. I make this all the time- it is quite mild but goes over well with seafood, simple chicken, and finiky children.

I served this with fish and the texture was perfect. Unfortunately, I didn't have any mint. I added more lemon and my husband thought it was too much lemon. It tasted good, but I feel like is still missing something.

This goes well with Seafood. The flavor was excellent. I have made this 3 times and will keep this in my recipe box for good.

I didn't have mint so I substituted something that mixes well with the other ingredients and is almost always on hand, fresh parsley. My husband and I thought it was excellant.

I thought this was too much work for such a bland dish. I followed the recipe exactly and realized later I should have read the reviews and spiced it up somewhat.

Will add to my "sides" recipe collection. Easy, clean tasting and quick to throw together. A keeper.

This side is a perfect complement to spicy main dishes. I have made it twice now, once with spicy grilled shrimp, and another time with the honey-gingered pork tenderloin. The second time I made it, I added sauteed mushrooms and asparagus. It is so quick and it looks so nice on the plates. Highly recommended.

Pretty good overall with definite extra use of the flavorings used in the recipe. Canned green beans are a good addition mixed right in liquid and all! I happened to be eating them as an additional side dish and discovered they jazzed up the couscous perfectly!

I have made this recipe several times to rave reviews. I add more lemon and herbs than stated and salt.

I added extra lemon and think that I should have added even more, along with salt & pepper. I also added finely chopped green onion tops which I liked a lot. I used whole wheat couscous and didn't have to alter the liquid at all. Tasty!

This was fantastic. My kids even loved it; served it with shrimp scampi. I spiced it up a bit more for the adults.

We thought this recipe was delicious -- but I did add more of all three herbs and the lemon juice. We made it alongside a grilled Grouper and a turkish vegetable salad...great on a hot day.

Here is a good tip to add lemon flavor, without the texture of lemon zest. Peal the zest off of the lemon in one ribbon, if possible. If the ribbon breaks, no problem - there's no need to be a slave to it. Just use what you get, but only use big pieces of zest ribbon. Add the lemon zest ribbon to the liquid. Then, add whatever other ingredients are needed. Leave the lemon ribbon in the couscous until ready to serve. Before serving, remove the ribbon and discard it. This trick also works great with rice.

For the cook from Ontario, I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I make variations on couscous frequently using bulk couscous from the food co-op, it is much less expensive. Regarding using more lemon juice, I would suggest a teaspoon or two of grated lemon peel for a more citrus flavor.

This is a very nice light side dish. I made it with the Foolproof Grilled Chicken from this site. It was very good but I might add a little more lemon juice next time. It is not a show stopper but people enjoyed it.
