This was great and didn't take long to prepare. I adapted it with left over chicken and still got great raves!!

I made this for dinner tonight and couldn't have been happier. I used slightly more wine and slightly less broth than called for and substituted balsamic vinegar and a few dashes of red wine vinegar for sherry vinegar. Following the recommendations of some other reviews I let the sauce simmer and thicken longer at the end, which intensified the flavor. My husband loved it too and we have enough leftovers for another full meal.

Made as written except braised chicken in the same pan I used for searing, as another reviewer suggested. The ras-el-hanout doesn't make it "spicy" in the sense of heat but really complex and flavorful. The braising liquid really permeated the chicken so it was tasty all the way through. Reduced the sauce to a little less than a cup (much less than recipe suggsted) so it was more concentrated. The sherry vinegar added a nice tang to the rich sauce. Made it for myself and my husband thinking there would be leftovers, and we ate every bite!

My family and I thought this was okay, but rather bland. Followed directions exactly using ras-el- hanout that my husband brought back from a recent trip to Morocco. Although, I put in extra thyme because a teaspoon just didn't look like enough. I'm not going to tinker with it, I'm going to try another of the Moroccan chicken recipes on this site.

Great flavors, similar to a curry. I found a recipe for Ras-El-Hout online. Also used large boneless and skinless chicken breasts which worked well. Carrots needed to be microwaved as they did not cook fully while chicken was baking. Will definately make this recipe again.

This was very good-rich and flavorful, feels like fall. I seared the chicken in a heavy roasting pan, took it out, sauted the carrots and shallots, deglazed the pan with the wine, then added the other ingredients and returned the chicken to the pan for braising.

Wonderful flavors, exotic and comforting at the same time. Not a quick prep meal by any means, but very enjoyable. I'm putting it into rotation.

Really flavorful and relatively easy to prepare. We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut in half. I'll add more carrots next time. For the Ras-el-hanout, I googled it and found a nice recipe for the spices, which worked like a charm.

Delicious mix of flavors and great use of fresh figs. I couldn't find the spice mix to buy, but made a version I found in an online search. Also substituted quartered carrot sticks for baby carrots and red wine vinegar for sherry wine vinegar.
