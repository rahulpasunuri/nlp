I've made this a couple times, tweaking each time. The bottom line is that it sounds good and should be good but it's not. I'm deleting it from my recipe box.

this recipe has become a summer staple at my house. have never found garlic chives, so i use regular chives and a couple of cloves of minced garlic. i add a little more white balsamic than called for. yes to the mozz globbing up. adding the oil right away helps, or chopping a ball of fresh mozz into cubes works as well.

All the problems other reviewers note - little flavor, globby cheese. Not worth the effort.

This was an ok pasta dish. I dont know if I will make it again. There was not much flavor in the pasta but it was quick and easy to make.

Fresh mozzarella, for a salad, was obviously never meant to be heated. If there is to be any heat involved, it should be with the pasta taken off the burner and put in a large bowl and left to sit so it's slightly warm but not hot or perhaps let it cool entirely, then gently stir in the mozzarella, carbonara style, so that it is slightly melted if melted at all. Also, I would think you'd want to apply olive oil to the pasta immediately so it's not all sticky...can't remember if she directed to do so or not. Haven't made this one yet, but I tend to be good at picturing how to cook something and avoid impending disaster, hehe. Your comments helped, I'm excited about making it for my Art Club picnic. Marinated fresh mozzarella balls, diced, would be even better!

Cheese globbed, so I will be more careful next time, but it was a real good pasta salad. Did not have white balsamic I used regular. Tasted fine.

Glad I'm not the only one who had a cheese glob problem. I loved the ingredients when I read the recipe so was horribly disappointed with results. Will give it another try with recommendations by other reviewers.

A few changes made this delicious and the multi-colored tomatoes were beautiful! While boiling the pasta, heat a skillet and add oil. When hot, add 2 minced garlic cloves and the fresh herbs. Turn off the heat after about 30-60 seconds. Add the tomatoes and vinegar. Mix tomato mixture with the drained pasta (no heat)--season with salt. THEN mix in the cheese. Pour onto serving dish and sprinkle with slivered basil. The cheese stays small and the whole dish blends together nicely!

Like other reviewers, I found this recipe a disaster. The cheese turned into one big gloopy, rubbery mess. What a disappointment. In order to rescue dinner I fished out the mass of cheese and crumbled some chevre instead. Perhaps adding the mozzarella off the heat might work. And, like others, 6 tbsp of olive oil is far too much. I used 2 tbsp and that was more than enough.

This was a good basic recipe, but I would rate it "delicious" or "exceptional." I couldn't find garlic chives so used regular chives - wonder if that might have made any difference.

I liked this dish and will make it again. The only tweaking I would do is less dressing- I added the dressing Tbsp at a time and ended up using less olive oil and vinegar than was called for.

This was a super-easy last-minute dish I made for a party. True, the cheese hardens as the dish cools, but it's infused with oregano, so who cares?

The flavors are nice together but it needs a little tweeking. Don't return the pasta to the pot as it's too hot and turns the cheese into one big glob. Also, I really don't think the vinegar is necessary. Leave the pasta a little wet and don't use so much olive oil. But really, the chives were nice.

Surprisingly good. I used whole wheat mini shells in place of the orecchiette, and I didn't heat the cheese and tomatoes. Instead I just let the heat of the shells slightly melt the mozzerella. I also used 1 inch cuts of plum tomatoes in place of the grape tomatoes. The garlic chives added a very mild garlic flavor (as the recipe stated).

Sadly, sadly disappointed. Can i rate 0-forks? This should have been a winner since it's everything the kids love. The tomatoes never warmed through, the mozzarella ended up as a giant cheese ball, the oil made the pasta greasy, and the flavors never blended. Try to put all three ingredients on the fork to get the full flavor, and the pasta or tomato half fell off the fork. Next time, make the standard tomato, mozzarella and basil salad with balsamic dressing.

Ordinary and unremarkable. I followed the directions carefully, yet the mozzarella melted into a mess within seconds of adding it to the warm pasta. I would use the dressing again, though: it was light and nicely flavored by the herbs.

Very simple type of Italian dish. I used chives, parsely, and basil from my garden, and no balsamic (didn't have), and it turned out killer. The basil really made it just like a insalata caprese, but with pasta.
