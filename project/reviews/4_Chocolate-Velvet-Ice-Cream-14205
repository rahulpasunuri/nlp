Like frozen pudding. Maybe I should have whipped it longer before freezing for more aeration? Intense chocolate flavor; agree with cook from Lyme it was better the second day but still not the texture I wanted.

I christened my brand new ice cream maker with this recipe today. It was also my very first time making ice cream. Despite my lack of experience, I could not resist altering the recipe. I only had 100% Cacao Ghirardelli on hand, so I chopped it up and added 2 tsp of Ginger Syrup and 2 Tbsp of Grand Marnier to it. I used 2% organic milk in the custard preparation. Also, I whisked in 1 tsp of finely ground cinnamon just before straining the custard. The result was divine, silky, rich, complex chocoholic's dream. I served the scoop with clementines and pecans. I am looking forward to making this again with ancho chilis and lavender.

Have made this twice to rave reviews. It will be my #1 ice cream recipe for a special dessert. Served it with fresh raspberries and it was to die for.

Utterly fantastic and extremely easy to make. I would not change a thing. It is worthwhile to splurge on exceptional chocolate. I plan to make it again and again.

This is my favorite ice cream - rich, dense, intense. Made it with Callebaut pastilles. It sets better after some time in the freezer, so it's best to plan ahead. My sister bought an ice cream maker after I made this for her family!

As a reviewer previously mentioned, this recipe can send you into a chocolate coma. The result was intensely fudgy, chocolatey and moussey. I didn't use an ice cream maker and someone mentioned that it didn't make much of a difference anyhow. I whisked it with the mixer for sometime though before freezing it. Used 6oz of a Hershey unsweetened bar and added 12 tablespoons of soft brown sugar to substitute the 6oz of semisweet chocolate. It was just nicely bitter when it was a custard but the next morning after an overnight freeze, I felt that it was sweeter than I cared for. Next time I would probably reduce the white sugar by a quarter cup. Flakes of bitter chocolate in the ice cream offset the sweetness a bit though. Wish I knew how to reduce the mousseyness and make it more ice-cream like.

Incredibly rich chocolate experience. You don't need more than a spoonful of this to satisfy your craving. Maybe I'm too used to Haagen-Dazs Mayan Chocolate, but I'm really not a fan of the creamy, mousse-like texture. This reminds me of recipes I've seen for people who don't have ice cream makers where you might be able to simply freeze this after whipping enough air into it. I prefer ice cream that a little more solid and less creamy. This fatty cream taste can probably be tempered by using less cream and lower fat content milk. I'd also recommend cutting down on the sugar to achieve a more bittersweet chocolate taste. It might be a nice complement to a dessert dish since you don't need much.

OMG this is absolutely divine! I'd give it five forks if I could. A standout dessert that would overpower any cake or pie. Just serve it solo, add a cookie or mint sprig if you need flourish. I made a lovely fresh strawberry ice cream from Epicurious the same day and it sadly paled in comparison. This is truly exceptional ice cream!

Never make this ice cream if you do not want your relatives to demand you make it every time you come for dinner. Because they will demand it. Every time.

This is the best chocolate ice cream in the world. It's incredibly intense and rich, and I plan to try varying it a bit next time with some peppermint or rum.

I've made this twice with Valrhona chocolate. it is the most decadant, rich chocolate ice cream ever. It is also more pudding-ish than your typical ice cream. there is so much chocolate in it you'd really have to go wrong to get any ice crystals forming at all.

Wow! It was very rich and custard-like. We made it substituting Splenda for real sugar.

Well, this is AMAZING, unbelievably rich and decadent. It may be the most intense chocolate experience I've ever had. And we got two different desserts for the price of one -- after running the ice cream maker for over an hour (!!), the custard was no more set up than when we put the whipped mixture in (maybe less), but we couldn't wait, so we had delicious and (relatively) light chocolate mousse, and put the canister in the freezer overnight to see if it would set up harder. It took about 12 hours, but the result was true ice cream in consistency, and a whole other dessert altogether (the flavors intensified and ripened; don't know if it was the time or the temperature). In any event, this is OUTSTANDING, and we'll make again -- once the chocolate coma subsides.

This is fabulously rich - one scoop will satisfy even the most voracious chocolate lover! I followed the recipe exactly, using plain old Hershey's cocoa and Ghirardelli bittersweet baking bars, and it was great. Scharffen Berger would only make it more amazing. It freezes very fast, so if you have an electric ice cream maker, don't leave it unattended for very long.

Whoa! 4 forks up! Rave reviews from everyone at party. I used Sharfen Berger chocolate. Incredibly rich and creamy results.

Very decadent and rich. I would make it again, but I will omit some sugar and some chocolate because it is too sweeet and a bit too chocolatey (and I am a chocoholic!). There is a variation of this recipe on The Food Network website that looks to be worth a try also as it was provided by Sara Moulton.

This delicious ice cream is a very dark chocolate, one very similar to Haagen-Dazs chocolate. At my son's request, we mixed in chopped bittersweet chocolate (1/2 cup) and frozen homemade cookie dough balls (1/2 cup of 1 t. each)with winning results----literally, he won second place in the chocolate catagory of a very popular ice cream contest in our city. Ours did not have the mousse-like texture, probably because we forgot to beat in in the mixer. It froze up beautifully and tasted better the second day. Yum!

Oh this is scrumptious! My husband complains about the price of premium ice creams, but not about this one, even though the ingredients alone run about $12 for the quart. (I use Scharffen Berger chocolate, organic maple sugar, and organic eggs, cream, and milk.) Ours doesn't have the mousse-like quality that some reviewers report. It's definitely ice cream--a very dense, rich ice cream. It's heavenly and sinful at the same time. It's one of those desserts that renders your dining room silent once your guests have taken their first spoonful.

I've made this chocolate ice cream many times and, while it always comes out great, I sometimes found the texture to be a bit too buttery, melty and mousse-like. So I made some modifications and, as good as the original is, this is even better. It's the best, darkest and most chocolatey ice cream I've ever made, or even had! I think having more milk than cream eases the butteriness, while the additional chocolate makes it just as rich. Here are my changes: 2 cups whole milk; 1 1/2 cups heavy cream; 9 tbsp. cocoa (1/2 cup + 1 tbsp.); 1 1/8 cups sugar; 1/3 cup honey; 9 oz. choc chips; 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla; 4 extra large egg yolks; 2 cups chopped walnuts (or more; it can really take it). I mixed the honey in with the sugar, etc., in the saucepan, and added the vanilla at the very end, before chilling the custard. I also didn't whip the custard in the mixer. The honey makes the ice cream soft and smooth enough, without incorporating too much air.

After reading the reviews i was concerned that I'd end up with a soft result, but that was not the case. This ice cream was rich and creamy - excellent. I have some left and can only eat a spoonful or so as it is so rich. I used the absolute best chocolate and cocoa powder I could find.

I was so disappointed. From the rave reviews I though so much more from this one. Too much sugar, too much... well, it was just too much. I couldn't finish more than a spoonfull. It resembled chocolate mousse, a cold, way too dark and sweet chocolate mousse - and I wanted ice cream.

I brought this into work and now everyone loves me. This ice cream is SO rich, it's almost like chocolate mousse. It's the best chocolate ice cream I've had. You only need a few spoonfuls. Definitely make this to impress your chocoholic friends who are not on diets.

The fudgiest, richest chocolate ice cream ever. This was my first attempt at homemade ice cream, and it was awesome. I used Trader Joe's bittersweet chocolate and Hershey's cocoa. I forgot to whip the mixture before turning it into the ice cream maker, but it was still divine.

Oh my GOD. This is by far the richest, most concentrated chocolate flavored ice cream I've ever eaten. Used Valrhona bittersweet chocolate and Droste cocoa, and it was heavenly. Even the melted puddles are pudding-like. Not for the faint of heart. It didn't make nearly a full quart of ice cream, because we all crowded around the sauce pan - then the ice cream maker - and spooned out the mixture along the way. Definitely a keeper.

My first home made ice cream experience. Exceptionally rich! And extremely chocolaty. My friends loved it. If it weren't so fatty, I would make it again. But then, it's the fat that makes it taste so good...
