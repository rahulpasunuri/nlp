Simple, flavorful, better after a day or two. Easy weeknight dinner with leftovers for lunch!

Delicious, I let it simmer longer, and probably added some more honey and lemon juice. I also added in some Paprika, and herbs de provence. Right before I served it, I added another sprinkle of lemon juice. This will likely go into my regular dinner line up.

Very easy and quick, but bland. Probably wouldn't make again.

Added artichoke hearts, coriander, cayenne, and smoked paprika. Simmered for a lot longer. Sprinkled a tiny bit shredded parmesano reggiano & served with grilled halibut and crusty italian bread. Tasty.

I didn't think this recipe was very tasty. It was a little bland. I probably won't make it again, but if I did, I would add a lot more spices.

We thought it was okay. The flavors were nice, but just not enough for a main course. Just not excited about it and won't make it again. I prefer a similar recipe that I have that includes zucchini, cardomom(sp?), cinnamon, cumin and cayenne pepper, along with the chickpeas and tomatoes.

This recipe was delicious! A hit between 6 people with very different tastes, and it was pretty simple to make.
