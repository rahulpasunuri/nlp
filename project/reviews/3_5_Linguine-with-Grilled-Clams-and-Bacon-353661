We made this exactly on the grill and it worked great. Just lay the clams over high, direct heat and just watch over them until they pop completely open. As soon as they do that, use tongs to grab the top shell and hold them steady to toss them in the pan with the sauce. We put the pan on the grill so the sauce would warm and we had a shorter distance to move the clams. We lost very little liquid from the clams this way. There's a lot of red pepper so if you don't like really hot, cut that down. We love spicy food so it worked great for us!

I put the clams in the disposable pan with the sauce and it was great. The clam juice they added after the opened and the original sauce over the pasta was outstanding. I did no want to loose the clam juice to the grill.

I made this last night for dinner. Fresh clams are little out of the budget, so I used canned. I only used 1.5 tsp of the red pepper flakes and will probably cut it down to 1 tsp next time. The bacon was very nice.

This was very good. It's a great version of linguine with clam sauce, and the bacon adds a great smokey flavor. As with the other reviews, I suggest doing it in a pan, as opposed to on the grill. I will definitely make that again.

I thought this dish was very tasty. I do agree with the others about grilling the clams - not necessary - you loose all the juices on the grill.

I suggest grilling the clams on FOIL so that you do not lose the juices! I've done them that way and it works out fine. Although, no reason to not do them in the pan with the sauce...

Grilling the clams as suggested in the recipe is a waste. It is nearly impossible not to dry them out and loose the juices on the grill. The addition of bacon to the traditional Linguine in clam sauce is really good, but other than that, the recipe as written here is not worth the effort.
