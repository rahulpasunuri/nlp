Not really a salad, but a quick and easy way to do green beans!

This is a great recipe. My whole family enjoys this dish so much. It's a must for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.

Fabulous! The beans were cut into 1" pieces, and also a sweet onion chopped small & sprinkled on top, S&P & EVOO, and I roasted them in the oven at 400 degrees for 35 minutes until tender & flavorful. I cooked the pine nuts on the stove with garlic over low heat, then tossed them in a large bowl with the finished beans & a ton of chopped basil & salt if needed. This is jam-packed with flavor and very delicious. I will definitely make this again!

I made this last night with a mix of green & yellow beans & made 1/3rd of the recipe. I didn't have fresh basil so used some in a tube. Still, the overall result was good but not WoW.

Fantastic recipe! This was a wonderful summer side dish

I've made this recipe for a couple years now. . .usually in summer when basil is really fresh. It truly gets raves everytime; great as a 'leftover'--I make sure to double the recipe everytime--and very nearly addictive. It's great warm or cold. It just makes me happy!

This dish was fantastic - quick to prepare and the flavors were wonderful. Just make sure your green beans are extra fresh, and don't over cook them!

I agree with the reviewer from GA in that the pine nuts would be better as a garnish - they do sink to the bottom of the dish. However, we did find the flavors to be nice. Next time if I make this, I may cook the nuts as written, but reserve some to sprinkle on top of the beans in the serving dish. The others would be good chopped a bit, I think, so they incorporate better with the beans.

Really enjoyed the dish. Fresh green beans, good pinoli nuts made a wonderful flavor together. Be careful when sauteeing the nuts not to burn them. Seemed to me they went from pale to dark brown really suddenly (of course, it could have been that I got distracted...maybe....)

Made this as a side dish for our Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone loved it. Easy!

I could eat this every day! My fiance and I both love it. It goes so well with so many things. Last week we had it with salmon, last night with roast chicken. Simply delicious.

This salad was good but not outstanding. I agree with the previous reviewers who felt there was too much olive oil. Also, although the ingredients alone are delicious, bringing them together in this recipe doesn't add up to a superior taste sensation.

I love pine nuts - & the roasted ones are even better! This was great & easy.

I too ran out of pine nuts so used walnuts - it was really good!

Love this recipe. So easy and tasty! A good way to get some roughage.

I did not have any pinenuts so I used pecans instead and took it to a work potluck. They got rave rewies and were gone immediately.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I love each of the ingredients individually, put combined, they didn't taste very good. Very lackluster. One thing was it had too much oil. The roasted pine nuts were the best part of the recipe.

Went out to the garden and picked beans and basil for this dish.It is really a lovely vegetable dish. My only quibble is with the word "salad" in the title.

Loved this recipe! I also cooked the beans a little longer -- maybe 10 min -- and substituted walnuts for the pine nuts. Definitely not lo-cal but tasty and a different idea for fresh beans.

This was a great, light & simple recipe for fresh summer green beans. I did use pecans instead of the pine nuts since that is what I had onhand. I have to say the pecans made the dish and I will have to add more next time. I did find that the garlic cooked a little too quickly being minced. I think I might try slicing the garlic next time. I would of preferred a sweeter, stickier garlic. Regardless it was still very good.

Needed a guick easy dish for a backyard gathering. Made this ahead of time and let it sit at room temperature. All gone! Even the kids liked it.

My friends and I enjoyed the taste of the salad, however I think I'll boil the beans a lot longer, the texture of the beans were a little to raw for my taste.

Just as good heated up again the next day!!

This easy recipe is a great dish to bring to a summer barbeque. I've substituted walnuts for the pine nuts with very good results.

I halved the recipe and both my husband and I thought it was great. A good recipe for any gardener with an abundance of green beans and basil.

Love this one when green beans are in season. Served with Salmon, beef and chicken. Everyone requests the recipe.

I really liked this dish. I found that adding a few tablespoons of red wine vinager added a nice flavor.

Relied on previous reviews and was still surprised at the great flavor. Received raves from dinner guests. A big plus -- it takes only a short amt. of time to prepare which leaves more time for guests

Good, but not spectacular. Liked pinenuts. Maybe they should be a garnish when serving so they don't sink to the bottom.

Excellant recipe. I agree that it's not really a salad, but more of a side dish. The only problem I had was with the pine nuts sinking to the bottom of the serving dish. Wonderful flavor. I served w/Garlic Mashed potatoes and Filet Mignon w/Merlot sauce.

VERY EASY TO MAKE, EVEN AT THE LAST MINUTE! I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE A NUMBER OF TIMES. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HIT WITH MY FRIENDS. IT IS VERY FLAVORFUL. THE BEST SECRET IS FRIENDS WILL THINK YOU WORKED HARD ON THIS RECIPE. THE ONLY WORK YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO SNAP THE BEANS.
