i thought the marinade was too vinagery. The second time i made it, i added soy sauce and sugar, and it turned out much better.

Made 1/2 the balsamic marinade for 3 mushrooms and I have to say that this came out very good. I will make this again:)

Just made this last night and did not think that it was that great. I was very disappointed. I followed the recipie and even marinated the veggies for a few hours before but they just tasted bland. Maybe you will have better luck but not something I will make again.

My grill on med-high burnt at 12 mins. I even re-read the directions thinking I missed something. What I could salvage was tasty. I will try again, but with a much shorter cooking time or lower temp.

Easy to make. I let the vegetables and mushrooms marinate in the liquid for 30 minutes and then cooked them on the grill using a grill wok. I will be making this one again!

This recipe is wonderful and cooking time is correct. Cook 12 minutes on each side over medium heat so everything cooks through and the peppers get soft. Good advice on putting the onions on a few minutes ahead. Also, don't forget to skin the peppers before slicing. This was a fantastic dish!

Please check the cooking time given in the recipe. It says grill 12 (twelve) minutes each side. Which comes to 24 minutes of grilling time. Should that have been 1-2 minutes each side???

Very easy and tasty. I used yellow squash and zucchini instead of the peppers and onions.

This recipe makes A LOT of veggies. Since this is one of the few vegetable side dishes my husband will eat - we'll be making it regularly in my household. He enjoyed the subtle flavoring of the balsamic vinegar and oil dressing.

Made it exactly as shown and it was great. Next time I will put the onions on first and let them cook a little before adding the rest of the vegetables; they seemed a little underdone in comparison.

Excellent blend of flavors.

I have already made this twice in a week. I make a few changes, I put the dressing in a ziploc baggie & marinate the veggies for a bit (while I prep the grill). I have used portobellos, zucchini, yellow squash, and scallions (instead of sliced onions). I also put the salt & pepper, to taste, into the dressing. I slice the squash lengthwise & just serve the grilled veggies on a nice platter. Yum! Very tasty, easy & versitile.

We sliced our vegetables right away and put them in the oven roasting pan and placed it on the grill. HEAVENLY.

Relatively simple to make and delicious! I used mushrooms, green and red Japanese peppers and it turned out nicely. Excellent when paired with a side of couscous.

This was great. I did mine on the George Foreman Grill instead og BBQ cuz I am an apartment dweller. I served it over whole wheat pasta with a glass of chardonnay. Superb! (Oh and as with any good summer dish asparagus on the side)

Delicious...I used vidalia onions instead of red as they are in season now. I don't know that I would bother with the lemon or thyme next time. The balsamic and olive oil is more than sufficient. Easy to prepare and very tasty! Will definitely make again soon!

I put my husband in charge of this dish since he was also grilling the turkey. It was delicious. I would encourage men to not be too hasty in taking the veggies off of the grill. I had to send my husband back a couple of times because he removed them too early. You may need more than 12 minutes depending on how thick your veggies are.

While Portobellos are yummy, I would probably make this with button mushrooms next time and save the portobellos for something that compliments them in a better way. They kind of got lost in all the other great flavors. I doubled this recipe (it then has 16 servings) and served it to about ten people. 8 had it with a Mediterranean lamb and garlic mashed potatoes. I got several compliments and the whole bowl disappeared.
