Perfect! Getting the whirlpool helps keep the egg together and it came out delicious!

Any tips for making multiple eggs at once - can you keep swirling and adding?

This recipe is why I love epicurious. It's a basic recipe with clear and helpful directions. I used it to help me make my first poached eggs ever. The recipe is so helpful, and the eggs were wonderful.

Sometimes the most basic of recipes are the best. I have never had such nice poached eggs.

I've been doing eggs this way for years. It works. Try serving a poached egg on an English Muffin. Use a glass as a guide and remove the outside of the muffin as a guide Add a slice of Canadian Bacon cover with hollandaise sauce and you will have Eggs Benedict.
