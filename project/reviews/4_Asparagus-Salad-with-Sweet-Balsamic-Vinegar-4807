What a GREAT way to use leftover asparagus from a different meal. Added grape tomatoes and presto, a salad that was even great for lunch the next day. This one's a keeper at our house.

Very simple and flavorful. As with anything, it's best with fresh, seasonal ingredients. I had good, dark, rich balsamic vinegar, and did not need to do the reduction, as I noted in the reviews. So, I used half the amount and it came out Just perfect. I had no nuts, other than sliced almonds on hand. I used those with a sprinkle of feta on top, with a grind of fresh pepper. Very nice- will make it again.

My husband and I love this recipe. For variety, we tried the dressing over asparagus, grape tomatoes, and sliced avocado: Definitely a crowd pleaser.

Easy and delicious, what more could you want? I too had some aged balsamic, mine was Frutti di Bosco, so it was quite sweet. The dressing turned out looking like chocolate pudding, so it was a little confusing to the eye, chocolate covered asparagus?! But it was gorgeous to eat. A trick for making sure you don't overcook the asparagus (crucial in this recipe, or any really), put a whole stalk in the water about 15 seconds before adding the rest of the pieces. When the whole spear has reached a bright green, take the lot out. The whole spear acts as a highly visible early warning (and a treat for the cook).

I think part of the problem may be the type of balsamic vinegar used. I have recently been researching it, and I've found that despite the expense, it pays to buy aged rather than store brand. The one I used was aged 8 years in oak,and I didn't have to reduce it. I also only needed about half a teaspoon, as it is already highly reduced. I did serve it with some prosciutto, which went nicely.

Wonderful salad- good blend of flavors. Allowed salad to marinate for about an hour. Great accompaniment to sweet potato & potato gratin.

I went with four forks because of the simplicity of this along with such a nice flavor. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 4
I thought it was okay, maybe three forks, but my boyfriend loved it and insisted on a four fork rating. He thought it was nice, colourful, crunchy and nice tasting. I thought it was good, but nothing special. Maybe next time make sure not to cook the asparagus too much so it's still crisp. The dressing was nice, had mashed potatoes with the meal and ended up soaking it all up with them and it was yummy.

Made this for Easter Dinner. This is by far the best asparagus salad I prepared, my husband raved about it. Absulutely wonderful!!!!!!!!!!

I'm giving 4 forks, the dressing is delicious! But I'm not able to follow directions exactly. I just snap off the ends of the asparagus, cook as directed, and drizzle a little of the dressing over the stalks. Serve the rest of the dressing on the side. I've served this as a side dish for buffet dinners, including Christmas and as hors d'oerves at a Super Bowl party. I've been asked for the recipe many times. Even my 10 & 15 yr olds ask me to make it.

This couldn't be easier or more adaptable. I made with dried thyme (scant teaspoon) because that's what I had on hand, pine nuts (because that's what I had on hand) and omitted the red pepper (because I didn't have any on hand) and it was delicious. It all comes down to the dressing which I'll use on other things. From other reviewers' suggestions, I added (a very small amount) bleu cheese which provided another "tang". Will keep making and playing around with this one.

This was FANTASTIC! I've given this recipe out to everyone I know. Loved the dressing and the flavors are amazing. We added a little gorgonzola cheese which really added to the flavor.

While marjoram is my current favorite herb, it is quite assertive and completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the asparagus. If I ever make this salad again I will leave it out. The balsamic reduction was nice enough.

I made this salad last night and it was unreal. I did substitute almonds for the pecans because, well I wanted to and I threw in some fresh mozzerella and it just added to it in my opinion. The dressing for this salad is so good, the flavors mix together perfectly. I am not a big aspargus fan, but this is so delicious. I am making it numerous times again.

I LOVED this recipe! I made this on a whim since I had asparagus and didn't know what to do with it. I threw this together in a couple of minutes...so easy but so delicious! I skipped the marjoram and red pepper (since I didn't have any and was too lazy to go back to the grocery store!) and it came out beautifully. I used white balsamic vinegar, too. I will definitely make this recipe again. I'm normally not big on asparagus, but now I am!

I leave the asparagus whole and serve it chilled so that I can make it ahead. It's also nice with some curls of parmesan cheese added right before serving. It's colorful and delicious.

I kept the asparagus whole and could not use the garlic or peppers due to dietary needs. Also had no pecans on hand- but still the family raved about it

i roasted and peeled the red pepper before slicing - i added some of my favorite hot sauce,linghams - 1/4 cup or so of crumbed gorganzola cheese - i used fresh basil for the seasoning herb. made this combo 2 times now , 2nd time better than 1st - will make many more times - was well liked by all my guests.

Are you kidding? When your mother-in-law requests this reciped over and over it HAS to be good. I do prepare the asparagus steamed, trimmed and whole and I substitute white balsamic vinegar which I found makes a better presentation. This is one of my favorite sides for dinner parties because it does not have to be served hot. Enjoy!! I'm bringing it for Thanksgiving!

I roasted the asparagus and used the dressing as a glaze. I've got some leftover which I think will have a myriad of uses. No marjoram - didn't have any.

Rating: 4
I hated this recipe the first time I tried it because I don't like marjoram. I tried it again, using fresh basil instead and it was amazing. I use a fair bit of garlic, too and top the salad off with shaved parmesan curls. Friends ask me to make it every time they come over. If I want to serve it in a more formal way, I leave the aspargus spears whole and drizzle the dressing, peppers, pecans and cheese over top. Warning, this salad does not keep well, serve the day you make it.

I use this recipe with slight modifications in my catering business and receive rave reviews each time. Perhaps the previous poster reduced the balsamic too much, because it does get sticky at that point. I leave the asparagus whole, place on platter and drizzle with the dressing, then top with the small diced red pepper and roasted pecans. This way the dressing doesn't overwhelm the asparagus and the whole presentation is more appetizing.

The dressing is like black tar. Why would you pour black tar over nice bright green asparagus and nice bright red peppers? I threw the dressing out and tossed the veggies with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper.

I'm not a HUGE fan of asparagus - but I loved this! It is the new FAVORITE SALAD in our house. Asparagus will now be a regular item on my shopping list due to this salad alone (the toasted pecans are a MUST)!

This was just OK. The combination of pecans, peppers and asparagus is a bit odd. I prefer steamed asparagus with a simple balsamic garlic vinaigrette.

This was only so-so. The vinegar takes a lot more than three minutes to boil down to half -- try twelve minutes; the pecans don't seem to add much and the balsamic dressing looks muddy on the asparagus.

I have mixed feelings about this dish, which I made exactly as written. Pro: beautiful colors, great for the Christmas table, easy, can be made in advance, nice blend of textures, dressing is good (am tempted to use it on a spinach salad, perhaps). Con: something just didn't click for me--it didn't really come together. I also usually roast asparagus, either in the oven or in a very hot pan, and I missed the added color and flavor from roasting. I'm not certain marjoram is the best herb here--maybe cilantro would add something. I might make this again, roasting the asparagus with salt and pepper and garlic and olive oil, then tossing with a modified version of the dressing. It did look beautiful though, and no one at dinner actually complained about it, though there were some leftovers. So, I might make it again anyway.

This was so great! I did tweak it a bit. In the dressing, I subbed basil for marjoram. I left out the nuts, and red bell pepper and pumped it up by adding baby carrots (cooked just a few minutes more than the asparagus)and tossing with canned beets when I added the dressing. Everyone loved it and it was so colorful!

Excellent. The third time I made it, I forgot the mustard...and the bell pepper with pecans. My husband and son who are not partial to asparagus loved it even more. In my opinion, with peppers and pecans it is more rich and can stand by itself, without them it makes an ideal light side dish for roasted meat.
