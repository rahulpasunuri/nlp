I added 1/2 c additional brown sugar, plus about 1 c dried cherries and 1/2 cup raisins....and it still only yielded about 3 - 8oz jars plus about 1/4 cup after cooking it down to being thickened. It tastes pretty good.

Not a *great* plum chutney, but a decent one. I added 1/2 c. more sugar than called for to cut the vinegar (I tasted it as I added, do the same), and kept the plums larger than the 1/4 inch called for here. It made a lot of difference.

Sorry, couldn't stand the bitter vinegar taste. Deffinitely a huge bomb.

I doubled the recipe and used my processor to chop the plums as it would have taken too long by hand. The chutney turned out very runny, so now I have 8 jars of spicey plum sauce. Would hand chopping have made a difference? I have never had a problem before now in chutney making. Disappointing.
