Not enough lemon--added 2 tsps. lemon zest. Also one tsp. tarragon and scant tsp. "garden blend" sea salt. Delicious with asparagus spears.

The lemon was a bit over powering. Easy to make bUt not worth the eat.

Nothing endearing about this. Took it to a dinner party with close friends and all advised I lose this recipe.

So much better than buying prepared veggie dip. Tastes good with everything and gets better after a day or two. Oh, it is incredibly fast and easy to make.
