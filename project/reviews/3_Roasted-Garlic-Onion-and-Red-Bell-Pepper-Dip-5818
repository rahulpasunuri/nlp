So good! I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious. My family devoured it. Nice creamy texture and great combination of sweet pepper/salty feta.

I too have been making this dip for many years. It never fails to draw raves from my guests. It is critical to roast your own red bell pepper and garlic as opposed to using the pre-roasted kind in a jar...that really dumbs down the flavor. To avoid a watery quality, it helps to dry the pepper really well and do NOT overprocess in the food processor. I did this one time and it destroyed the consistency of the dip...but every other time I've made it it's been a huge hit. I always add a bit of extra feta as well.

I have been making this recipe since I first saw it in Bon Appetit back in 1998. I have also tried some tweaks on it such as the goat cheese and omitting the olives. But whatever small things I do, it gets rave reviews every time I make it!

Note instruction to refrigerate until firm -- I missed that part and thought I had done something terribly wrong to end up with red pepper soup. In the future, I would cut down the cream cheese and add goat cheese, as another reviewer suggested. Given that I thought I had soup, I actually tried adding miso broth and it wasn't bad as a soup either.

I'd have to agree with previous reviewers that the flavor was good but strongly resembled pimento cheese in flavor and color. I expected stronger flavor, but it was surprisingly mellow.

I've made this several times, always a hit. For even more flavor, I use 8-10 kalamata olives, and substitute goat cheese for part of the cream cheese. Awesome. Always a hit when tailgating at Michigan stadium before UofM football games, and really wine friendly!

I served this at a small tapas party. Everyone loved it. If I made any changes, it would be to add a little more feta and a little less cream cheese.

Served this with a couple fresh baguettes to rave reviews. Color was not bad, and the taste was great. I would recommend letting the flavors mix for a while (>4 hours) in the refrigerator, as this improved the taste a lot.

We made this for a couple of parties over the holidays - it needed a little tweaking but guests really loved it. We used a HUGE red pepper the first time and it was a little watery. We then tried an average-sized one the next time and it was perfect. We also cut down the number of kalamata olives to four and used less feta cheese. Also you do need to roast garlic and pepper in the oven, don't use the jar stuff. It is easy, smells soooo good and makes all the difference!

I cannot believe that anyone liked this dip. It was terrible and not worth the trouble of roasting the onions, garlic and red pepper. There was very little taste and not visually satisfying.

This recipe tasted great and got rave reviews from guests. A few amendments to the recipe: I used 8 kalamta olives instead of 6 olives and the capers. I also cut the baguette in half before slicing the crostini pieces -- turned out like 'crostini crescents', but meant there were more to go around, and these smaller pieces were easier to dip.

People liked this when we served it at a party, but we weren't bowled over. It had a good flavor but reminded us of pimiento cheese. Like some previous reviewers, we used roasted garlic from a jar to save time--perhaps this was part of the problem. Overall, I think it just needs a little more spark.

A fellow cook served this to me at a dinner party. It was so good that i asked her for the recipe and have made it many times to everyone's delight. IT IS CRUCIAL to let the flavors meld before serving - otherwise they are too harsh.

This recipe was delicious. I wouldn't change a thing. I've had many requests for the recipe.

If you like feta, this dip is for you. I put this out with breadsticks, and crudites. My guests ate this willingly, but if I make it again I am going to leave out the red pepper. Not that it was bad. The pepper made the dip surprisingly sweet, and lightened the otherwise very thick consistency. But I found the sweet aftertaste a little strange, especially with the other savoury flavours (roasted garlic, onion, feta).

Mmmmm. This was terrific and is always a huge hit at parties. I left out the olives and used roasted garlic from a jar (I tried roasting it in the oven but it burnt).

This was terrible! I made it for a party and no one ate it. The flavors were way too harsh and it tasted like the bottom of an ashtray. I would leave out the olives & capers, if I were desparate enough to make it again.

A real wasy crowd pleasing dip; I served it with vegis and salted bread sticks in stead of French Baguette

I used roasted red peppers from a jar which made this easier. I loved it. Used more garlic and more olives. Yum!

I recommend roasting the garlic without cutting it. The exposed garlic burnt and was chewy and had to be discarded...a lot of waste.

This dip was an assault on my tastebuds - way too many strong flavoured ingredients to be in one dish. Had to make an alternative appetizer as this one was just not good enough to serve to guests!

Delicious! Perfect for a party. It was gone in a flash.

First time I did this I did not char the bell pepper long enough, but I got it right the second time. I can only conclude that people who don't want to just keep on making this over and over aren't doing it right! Yum! Just add home-baked baguette and a bottle of a really grassy Sauvignon Blanc.

Served this along with many other apps. on New Years Eve - my olive/caper hating boyfriend and his football buddies devoured it and couldn't say enough!!! The wives, girlfriends and myself also enjoyed it greatly. Easy to make

I used this dip at a holiday party and found it bland on breadsticks, but perfect on wheat thins. Use it with salted crackers or add a dash of salt. Leftover dip is also very good heated over pasta (with a dash of salt), sort of a "garden alfredo".

Delicious. I will definitely make this one again.

Great recipe! I made this for a party and everyone loved the unique flavor from the roasted garlic & onion. I used light cream cheese and it was still great. The consistency was perfect. Although I served it with a baguette, as someone suggested, it would also be good with vegies.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be easy and delicious. It was great with toasted bread rounds but would also be really good with any raw veggies, like carrots and celery. I will make this recipe again.

We used this as a side dip in our fondue and it was FANTASTIC!! Would definitely recommend it!

I made this for a 4th of July party (about 35 people) and to my surprise a young boy around the age of 10 came up to me and said "That cheese dip you made is great!" The adults loved it as well. I used 1/3 lb. roasted red peppers purchased from a local grocery deli - made the preparation much easier. You definitely need to refrigerate for several hours to let the flavors meld and for the mixture to get firm.

I thought this this dip was great, not magnificent but definitely worth making again. I used spreadable cream cheese which gave a good soft dip consistency and I also caremalized the onions with sugar in the fry pan and then added to the rest of the ingredients. I served it with crostini.

Sorry - but I did not care for this dip. The flavors are at odds with each other. The feta cheese completely overpowers the roasted onion and red pepper. It is very thick, so you need to use it as a spread. I didn't think it was really easy or quick, either. (Roasting the garlic and onion is fine -- but you could buy roasted peppers since the whole things is processed!)

This is a lovely recipe that is quick and easy. A great make-ahead that's sure to fetch rave reviews from dinner guests. We used leftover spread on toasted bagels and even mixed some in with some with freshly steamed rice, SINFULLY DELICIOUS!!!!! (I must admit though, as we are garlic lovers, I doubled the quantity of garlic!) Enjoy!
