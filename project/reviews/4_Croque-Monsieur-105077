I haven't made this recipe but it looks like a winner to me. I love grilled cheese sandwiches in all their forms (see "Great Grilled Cheese" by Laura Werlin), but would do a couple of things differently: Grate the cheese (always) for better, more even melting. When using a griddle, cover the sandwiches for at least the first half of cooking. A reminder: remove the bay leaf before using the sauce (of course), and a question: what's with the chives?

Made this for dinner last night and it was wonderful. I've already given it to my bff this morning. Will be making croque-monsieur many times in the years to come. My husband loved it.

I doubled this for our family of four and still had plenty of leftover Bechamel sauce -- I would suggest not doubling sauce unless you have more surface area to cover (I was using a semi-round French loaf from La Brea at Harris Teeter) or want to serve it on the side as another reviewer suggested. Very filling and subtly delicious! Easy to modify for the under-6 crowd, too. It did take awhile for the sauce to thicken, maybe b/c I was doubling?

My husband, who is French, and picky, said this was the best Croque Monsieur he's eaten. I used an unsliced loaf of "pullman white" - a light weight firm spongey white bread (you can knock on the top of it, but fluffy interior) and sliced it into 1 inch slices.

My husband and I agree this is a hit outside the park. He cant thank me enough for making it.

Had some leftover ham I needed to use up. This recipe was perfect for it. My husband called it a home run.

I've seen the traditional recipe for this dish in my old faithful cookbook, but hadn't made the dish until seeing it on Epicurious. This is by far the best knife-and-fork sandwich I've ever made or tasted. And it's so insanely easy! It takes me longer at the deli counter to get the ham than it does to make this dish. It's simple to scale up or down the number of servings. This recipe has become part of my weeknight dinner repertoire.

Delicious! I used french ham and aged gruyere...the best croque-monsieur I've tasted!

we made this for a potluck brunch. Instead of white bread, we trimmed down two baguettes (so they weren't so bready) so that we could have a nice long sandwich that could be portioned out easier (and visually was a much nicer presentation). We substituted 1% instead of whole (that's all we had) which made thickening the sauce a bit difficult - though some extra flour fixed that.

Absolutely delicious! The perfect main for a long fall lunch with a mixed green salad and a bottle of white bordeaux. Spreaded dijon mustard on one side of the sandwich for a little French heat.

Also did this up breakfast style, subbing thick cut Blackened Maple bacon and a fried egg for the Black Forest ham. Crazy Good!

Just Wonderful! That's all.

I did not serve it with the Bechamel as it's a bit too stodgy for our tastes - instead I beat 1 egg with a Tbsp of water, dipped the prepared sandwich into it and then pan-fried it - this gives it a lovely golden and crispy exterior with a gooey filling!

Rather than broil my sandwiches with the bechamel, I just put the bechamel in a warm bowl in the middle of a warm platter with the sandwiches cut into quarters around it. This is just fabulous (particularly for late night soirees after a few glasses of wine)! It's a famous hit among our friends - the "cock monster"!

Easy and delicious. Nutmeg is essential. Improves with better bread.

I made these in a Croque Monsieur grill with home made bread. Served with cantaloupe, these sandwiches are a perfect summer brunch.
