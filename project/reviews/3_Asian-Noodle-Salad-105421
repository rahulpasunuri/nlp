This is delicious and could easily be modified to any diet. I would double the dressing next time and marinade some protein in it, then grill or bake the protein and toss it into the salad. Shrimp would be a fantastic choice!

I made this for a work potluck. Doubled everything and used celephane noodles. Also added snow peas and red pepper. It was a hit!

Yummy! You can do a lot with this recipe, but you'll need at least double the ginger. I've cut down the prep time by substitution the shredded carrot and radishes with the precut broccoli/carrot/cabbage slaw you get from the salad section.

Not very good. I added sugar like other reviewers suggested, but it still was too strong tasting of soy sauce. I thought it was a little better heated. I won't make this again.

My boyfriend and I loved this dish. I used Asian egg noodles (like Ramen) and replaced the pepper flakes with some wasabi powder). I didn't have any fresh ginger so i used ginger powder. I put it in the fridge and served with dinner! Great and easy dish...

Made as side dish for dinner party and it was fabulous as is. Made it day before and used most of the dressing; then day of party let it come back to room temperature and added balance of dressing. Used the frozen cubes of ginger and garlic to save time, too.

I made the recipe with shallots instead of garlic (I ran out of garlic) and I added the peanut butter and sugar like the reviewer below suggested. I also ended up using way more carrots than the recipe calls for because I over estimated how many cup I would shred with five smaller size carrots. Anyway, the results were good but not fabulous. The kids liked it. My picky eater son had no problems eating it and he wants me give it to him for lunch tomorrow at school.

Great recipe with some changes/additions. Change the radishes to 1 red pepper, sliced and change linguine to spaghetti. Add one bunch of fresh cilantro (chinese parsley) for a fresh flavor that makes the recipe. Also, it could use some extra dressing since it seems to absorb into the noodles overnight.

I thought this was really good--2.5 forks. Next time, I would add more vegetables, like broccoli or peppers. I think this is a very good base to build on.

Overall this was easy to make and would have been quite tasty if it weren't for the overwhelming soy/salt taste. Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of soy sauce and likely add more scallions.

I added another 1/2 recipe of the sauce plus 1 Tbsp sugar as previously suggested. We really like scallions so I added an extra three. I let it sit in the fridge for an hour to absorb the flavors. The family loved the salad.

Not so great exactly as printed, way too much soy flavor, but add 2 1/2 T. sugar to cut the soy sharpness down and 2 T. peanut butter, whip it all together in a blender and you have a four star sauce.

Excellent take to Church covered dish. This was so easy and tasty - a real keeper. Will make for home. Made the night before and refrigerated until the next evening. All understated flavors. Suited everyone's taste. All was eaten and 6 people asked for the recipe. I followed the "dressing" recipe exactly. I left out the scallions all together. I used thin spaghetti #9 instead of linguine noodles. I added package of fresh basil, cup shredded carrots, 1/3 red bell pepper, black olives, cut into thin circles.... sesame seeds... I would want the dressing hotter next time and would add cayenne pepper to the dressing.

As the recipe stands, I give it two forks-- with my personal adjustments, four forks. It isn't that I'm such a fabulous cook, I prefer spicier food. I added a few blobs of Sriacha (I know I butchered the spelling) and some spicy hoisin sauce (from a jar) and I really enjoyed it. I think it didn't quite make the 6 servings it promised.

I thought this was just so-so. It needed something more ... maybe thinly sliced carrot instead of shredded, and maybe some snow pea pods.

as per the other suggestions I added peanut butter, and orange zest. i did not add the radishes. it was ok. i think it needs a little more fire.

Rating: 3
I followed this almost to a t, but added 2 tablespoons natural peanut butter and a tablespoon of water to the sauce. I also blended the sauce, and it was very good. With hoisin/sesame glazed chicken (I used the IronChef brand) it makes a good, easy pasta alternative to a hot red tomato sauce in the summer.

Rating: 2
I would make this dish again, however, I would use less vinegar by about half, and much less orange peel zest if any. It overpowered the delicate seasoning flavors. I can recommend serving it along side the Roasted cornish game hen with sesame ginger sauce, put the game hen on top of the Asian Noodle Salad and have the goat cheese and herb souffle as a pre course.

Made this dish for two parties, everyone at both loved it. Goes well with Hoisin Skewer Chicken. Quick and easy, especially if the sauce is made ahead. A winner!

I've enjoyed this dish store-bought and was very pleased to be able to recreate it at home. Made it over 24 hours in advance to let the noodles marinate. Also, I used a little bit more of the soy sauce, vinegar, & sesame oil to really coat the noodles.

Rating: 3
The dressing is great. I used leftover cooked spaghetti (from pesto and pasta the night before), added green onion, some julianned red pepper and a handful of shreaded carrots (cheated and picked them up at the salad bar in the store). You could use almost any combination of colorful veggies to make it pretty - the carrots add a nice sweetness. Served it as a side with the Glazed Salmon (from this sight) the first night, then with grilled chicken tenders (marinaded in soy and sake) mixed in as a main, one dish entree course the second night. Flavors were even better the second night.

This dish makes for a lot of effort for little reward. Perhaps if the radishes were left out, sub red pepers, minus the red peppers, add cubed fried tofu, and this dish might be good. Better bet to just buy the salad at the deli.

I love this recipe. Served it at a BBQ and got plenty of raves. I skipped the radishes (who likes them anway!) and tossed in some slivers of red pepper. Made dressing ahead of time and let ingredients blend in fridge. Cooked pasta, cooled under cold water and tossed with dressing and served. Presto! What a cinch!!!

This is a summer staple in my house. For veggies, I like julienned red peppers, carrots and green onions. Adding black sesame seeds instead of white makes a big difference in presentation. Also, using a high quality Japanese soy sauce improves both color and flavor.

This is a very good salad. Because of previous reviews I cut back on the red pepper and ginger. The next time I would use the amount called for. Not a strong flavor at all. After cooking I cut the noodles with sissors to make the pieces smaller and easier to handle. Not at all slimy. Even better the next day

Rating: 3
Wonderful! I added some julienned red pepper, snow peas and a handful of large shrimp. I sauteed the veggies and shrimp first, so the dish ended up being more of a pasta entree than a cold salad, but it still maintained a fresh taste. Very easy to make!

My kids (4 and 1.5) loved this for both dinner and lunch the next day. My Asian grocer's Seasoned Rice Vinegar contained MSG so I substituted Sushi Vinegar with great results.

We really enjoy this recipe in our house. In addition to the Asian Noodle Salad I put out bowls of bite sized chunks of chicken, shrimp, beef and pork depending on who is there that evening. Then people can choose how they want to dress it up.

I added a bag of oriental premix salad for a different texture since someone mentioned it being slimy. The flavor was too intense. It was not a favorite amongst our last dinner crowd. Not too many like radishes and ginger.

We tried this for a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. It was kind of slimy. I've had lots of Asian noodle salads and this is not one of the tops. The ginger was a bit overwhelming and I didn't like how it stuck to the noodles. And I am a ginger fan. Oh well, gives me a reason to try another recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the scallions (didn't have any on hand). Snow peas seem like a good idea though. May tweak it the next time around. Very good, very simple, and great for lunch the next day.

I make a similar dish often but I add a lot of bean sprouts and a small bit of peanut butter or a few tablespoons of Thai peansut sauce. Takes it from bland to excellent. Also, I break up the noodles a bit before cooking.

My husband and I thought it was delicious. Changes I made were to increase the amount of garlic, and subbed the radishes for red bells, and snow peas (as someone else suggested), and I also served it with some leftover chicken. The sesame seeds gave a great flavor and texture to the dish. This one is a keeper.

As with many of the recipes in this section - it is good but nothing spectacular - just many comments for some trivial nitpicking. i.e. what type of pasta is appropriate. I happened to have thin Chinese noodles on hand, followed the recipe exactly (unusual for me because like many of you I like to tweak) and it was a good and easy side for chicken on the grill night. It was also tasty the next day for cold lunch. Maybe next time I'll use "Italian" pasta - I'm sure it will be good - just slightly different.

Loved this salad--and it's perfect for a quick summer dinner. I'm not crazy about either carrots or radishes, so I substituted red bell peppers and snow peas, with wonderful results. I also added some cooked shrimp. If you don't like things really spicy, cut the amount of red pepper in half--that's the only other change I would make.

This is a great recipe. I didn't add the radishes or the sesame seeds. I did add smoked bbq chicken but pork would be delicious too. I stir fried one large sliced onion, 3 pressed garlic cloves and 2 C.broccoli. It's definately a keeper.

I thought that this recipe was ok (and I must admit, I had no radishes, hubby ate 'em as a snack after work), but my husband (was he guilty about eating the radishes?) *raved* about it, which is why I'm even reviewing this. I think adding a little honey might be nice, radishes sound like a *great* idea, but I see no reason for peanut butter, the sesame wouldn't be a strong note then.

Rating: 3
This type of meal gets us through the summer. My son is allergic to sesame seeds so I use a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter to replace the oil and seeds for flavoring. I also broil sliced chicken breasts or shrimp that I have sprinkled with soy sauce to add and make it complete. Both cook quickly and easily without adding heat to the kitchen. Snow peas or any crisp veggie in place of the radish/carrots works for variety. I also chill this dish. For us the red pepper is a must have ingredient and our family with it's low blood pressure likes the salt.

A good summer side dish. I used whole wheat spaghetti, hope that meets with everyone's approval, and added some broccoli to the veggies. I also added a few tablespoons of honey to the dressing. Next time though, I will try adding the peanut butter too, as recommended. Served it with grilled skewered shrimp that had been brushed with soy sauce, hoisin, and honey. Everyone liked it and it was simple, which are the things that matter to me...not Asian authenticity or how sophisticated the recipe is.

I loved this dish - delicious and easy! It made a great vegetarian main course and didn't heat up the kitchen. The only "heat" I wanted was lots of extra ginger!

Two out of four forks, and that's being generous. I used chinese egg noodles, so as not to upset that well-known bastion of asian culture -- Boston. And pretty much followed the recipe from there, adding some halved, cooked shrimp. I thought the dressing was just alright, but would probably be improved with the addition of a tablespoon of peanut butter as suggested by previous revewers. But the vegetables were boring. Next time I might subsitute the radishes with a can of water chestnuts, the carrots with chopped red bell-pepper, and maybe add some slivered sno-peas or even straw muchrooms. Finally, a nice handful of cilantro would be in order just before serving.

I made this recipe for a cookout, doubling it. Everyone who ate it really liked the recipe. I left out the radishes and realized I was out of sesame seeds after everything else was completed, so left them out, as well. I added a little extra sesame oil and some crushed red pepper right before serving it. I would make it again as it is an easy and tasty alternative to the traditional pasta or potato salad that shows up at every barbecue throughout the summer. Next time I will try it with the Soba noodles.

Hey Cristobal (Aug. 4): I don't care if you've been a chef for 13 years or whatever. It's not nice to make yourself feel superior by making fun of people in other places, especially if you're not exactly living in the hippest metropolis in the world yourself.

I thought this was just fine - nothing wild, but still good. Hey Cristobal - Just because you've been a chef for 13 years doesn't quite give you the right to cut down us Oklahoman cooks! Given your experience, you should be able to come up with your own recipes, not have to resort to these "common" recipes for us Oklahomans!

I haven't made this recipe. I am rating the reviews, which provided great entertainment after a long few days at work. Wish I had a Sapporo. Maybe I'll just open an American Chardonnay and meditate.

It's just a starting point, folks. From an authentic American mongrel...

I agree with April. I thought it was way too salty...and I don't even have an aversion to salt. I added more vinegar and then a smidgen of sugar to try and counterbalance that.

As other readers have noted, this salad didn't seem all that special to me. I'm not a big salt fan and it was way too salty with 1/4 cup of soy sauce so I'd say to use low sodium or perhaps just 1/8 cup. Also the use of the red pepper did not seem necessary. The ginger provided a good "kick". I added grilled scallops and shrimps which changes the recipe but for my family that made all the difference.

Thanks, all. I am glad to know I wasn't totally out of line by being offended by Bostons comments. It is just a recipe! :) I enjoyed it the way I made it, and so did my husband. Anyway, I probably wouldn't know authentic Asian cuisine anyway, being a Norwegian Midwesterner. So I really don't care! It tasted yummy, and that's all that matters. I'll be quiet now, promise. :)

Curiously lacking in Asian flavor. Adding a tablespoon or two of tahini (ground sesame paste) (or, if you don't have any, some smooth peanut butter) to the dressing would perhaps satisfy the purist who demands Asian noodles instead of linguine.It would add wonderful flavor as well as authenticity to the dish.

Rating: 3
Following my neighbor's advice, I used Asian noodles instead of linguine. I also subtituted Korean hot pepper flakes and Korean radish where appropriate. I doubled the garlic and ginger, but couldn't find real Chinese ginger. Feeling horribly inauthentic, I threw in some fish heads and chicken feet to compensate, put on a kimono, rubbed my buddha, sat on my tatami mat, popped open a Sapporo, opened my Little Red Book, got out my chopsticks, flicked on the TV to the Godzilla marathon on TNT, and ate my salad. It's a recipe, folks. Like it, hate it, change some ingredients, tell us there's not enough oil, make it, don't make it, or refuse to make it because you're offended. We don't care as long as you don't try to show off or bother us with misplaced righteous indignation.

Wow, what a response to a recipe! I always enjoy reading the replies of other folks who take the time to use the wonderful recipes on this web page. Hey if Boston did not like what he/she read fine, we all have our likes and dislikes. There are some recipes I have attempted and they did not come out as I expected. But that is why I keep trying different ones and experimenting. It is fun and relaxes me at the end of a work day. I hope someday I can contribute a recipe to this page.

I thought we were supposed to rate the recipes, not each other's comments. IN any case, this was a delightful dish. I did not have rice wine vinegar on hand so I had to use white wine, and it turned out lovely. Remember no recipe is written in stone.

Italian pasta isn't authentic for an Asian recipe? Better study your World History. Anybody remember Marco Polo who journeyed to the Orient and brought back a common cooking ingredient found there which Italians named pasta?

I am really surprised at how many of your readers just love your recipes, when they change so many of the ingrediants in them! And I agree with your reader that questions the use of italian noodles in an asian noodle dish. Maybe you should change the name of the recipe. Snobbishness has nothing to do with the ability to know what a dish will taste like by the ingrediants used. This is a talent and comes with experience and love of cooking.

Without even making this recipe, I would deduct three forks for failure to specify Asian noodles instead of linguini. It's not as if these aren't readily available in most supermarkets, even if you aren't near a Chinese market. Anyone considering making this dish should use thin Asian egg noodles to get the right texture. As for the cook who substituted peanut oil for sesame -- yuck! They're vastly different. Don't do it.

Served this cold with warm grilled shrimp and scallops on top. Used Lo Mein noodles and orange sweet peppers and vidalia onion instead of carrots and radishes. Only used half of the soy sauce (low salt), red wine vinegar and olice oil. Didn't salt the pasta water and just the fresh ginger was hot enough without the red pepperflakes, for me. Forgot the sesame seeds, which would of been nice. This was great and easy summer supper!!!
