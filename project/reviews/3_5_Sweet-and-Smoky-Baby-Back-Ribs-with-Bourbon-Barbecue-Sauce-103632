Great recipe, the rub was really nice. Except--that amount of salt is way, way, way too much. Maybe ok for 6 racks of ribs but the rest of the rub would be too little for that amount of ribs. I'd cut the salt back to 1 Tb or even less. You can always add salt but can't take it away.

Admittedly, I only used a portion of this recipe; I marinated the ribs in bourbon and then applied the spice mixture(minus the cumin since my husband doesn't like that spice). After that just threw them on the grill and cooked until done, applying my own BBQ sauce towards the end. The ribs were delicious. The bourbon and spice mixture I will use again and again.

My family loves these ribs! The rub makes twice the amount I use so I save half for the next time. I use a Weber grill to cook with indirect heat and they turn out amazing every time. After reading some of the other reviews, I will start making them in the oven during the winter. These ribs are also good cold the next day.

I made these ribs and everyone loved them! awesome ribs. Although I didn't make the bourbon barbecue sauce, I used Sweet baby rays in a bottle, but it turned out great.

This recipe is sooooo incredibly good! We did not BBQ the ribs with the smoke chips, though. So, to create a "smokey" flavor, I used smoked paprika, instead of regular paprika. Delicious! Still soaked the ribs in bourbon, which helped to tenderize the meat. And when it came time to grilling them, we simply put them on the grill for 15-20 minutes, flipping once, and basted them with the Bourbon Barbecue Sauce for the last couple of minutes. Had more BBQ Sauce on the table for extra sopping. I will make these again and again!

Ok, well I made them and cooked them in the oven at about 200-250 F for about 4 hours. I poured some beer in the bottom of the pan to make up for the fact that I wasn't cooking them on beer soaked wood or whatever. They turned out PERFECT! Everyone was absolutely crazy for these ribs. Cooking in the oven on a low temp for a long time works just fine.

I am very excited about trying this recipe for the 4th of July. My Italian friends love it when I cook American style foods for them, and are crazy about ribs. However, I don't think I can do all that fancy grill work with the supplies that I have (and being 5 months pregnant in this heat I simply can't shlep all over Tuscany looking for the stuff) Can anyone recommend an easier way to prepare the ribs that will still give me tender, fall off the bone meat? I have all the flavoring stuff, I am just talking about how to cook them. Can I start them in a low oven for several hours and then move to the grill? I really don't think that even if I looked I would find the wood chips- is there something else I can do to have the smoky, woody, beer flavor? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

I've made this recipe several times now. The first time was for a superbowl party. No practice, never used my smoker before, you know totally unprepared. By the time the ribs were ready, it was half time and most everyone was full. I had bought about $100 dollars worth of ribs and was worried no one was going to eat!!! All it took was one!! LOL Almost all the ribs were gone by about the third quarter. Everytime I make it people are impressed. Matter of fact, I'm deployed now and didn't have the recipe with me. I've been searching the internet and I have found you my lovely ribs!!!! ha ha. So, now I have a big BBQ planned in a couple weeks. I did alter the recipe somewhat to give it a bit of my own creativity, but I tell you, this sauce and rib recipe...and the beans are fantastic!!!

Made this yesterday and I must say...FABULOUS! Just the right amount of kick - delicious flavor. I used the rub on a full slab of ribs (not baby back). Let the rub set on the meat for a little more than an hour and cooked for about three hours, uncovered, in a 325 oven. Cooled, refrigerated. The next day cooked via indirect heat method, in gas grill, with Jack Daniels pellets in a smoker box. They took about an hour at 300. Perfect results. Thanks for a great recipe. This is in my "do again, and again" recipe collection.

To the cook from Long Island NY. You clearly have your recipie review mixed up with some other recipe. Or, am I blind but I don't see cinnamon or cardamon anywhere in the ingredients. I'm going to make these this weekend. They look delicious.

Well, there's a mixed bag of reviews from our house. My 21 year old son LOVED it, I liked it and my husband didn't care for it. I liked the complexity of flavors that both the rub and the sauce produced, but hubby's initial reaction was..."This tastes like an Indian curry"...evidently something he didn't expect or care for when eating pork ribs. I know that the flavor he was tasting was the ground cardamom, which I did reduce down to 1 tsp. along with the ground cinnamon. I do use ground cardamon in various Indian spiced dishes so I can understand why he made the association. I'm willing to make this one more time without the ground cardamom to see if he has the same reaction. The sauce was delicious, but I reduced the amount of brown sugar in that as well as we're not really sweet sauce lovers. I used my immersion blender in the saucepot to smooth things out a bit, but had decided to do this after I'd already reduced the sauce to a thickened state...the pureeing of the veggies only thickened it more (just a heads up...if you choose to puree it, do it before reducing it too much!) so I thinned it out just a tad with additional bourbon, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. ;-)

Very flavorful and worth the time it takes to make the dish. I have made this receipe numerous times and recommend that you grind the rub ingredients so that the rub is a semi-fine powder. This makes for a better mix of flavors and also ensures a more even coating on the ribs.

I made this recipe for a camp, and the ribs were delicious! We wrapped the ribs in three-layered foils and cooked them in a closed grill. When the ribs were completely cooked, the meat was falling off of the bone. I am definitely going to make this recipe again.

Made this for friends visiting from out of town. I doubled the recipe since we had so many people. the ribs were good, but the souce was outstanding!! Everyone loved the ribs, but I think I just do not like the bourbon taste on the ribs..Next time I am going to try dark rum instead...might be a little sweeter...

I made this barbecue sauce and rub for a cook out on Memorial Day Weekend. The sauce was so-so, but one word sums up the rib-rub: VILE. One or two guests manfully choked them down, but others took one bite and hid the ribs under napkins or buns. Luckily we had entree alternatives so the entire party wasn't ruined. Afterwards, I checked the ingredients, they were individually fine, and reviewed the recipe so I'm sure I didn't miss anything. It was just disgusting. Never would I recommend this recipe.

Really tasty recipe and easy to make. May have to cut back on the pepper and use the mortar and pestle to grind down the coarseness of the rub for my hubby. Will make again.

These were most excellent! Everyone who tried them, including my teenage son and way too picky 5 year old daughter, LOVED them. We have a Brinkmann smoker that we use most weekends and had no problems using it for this dish. Spare ribs were on sale and were really beautiful, so we used them instead, but we'll try baby backs next time. The ribs were amazing on their own, but when coupled with the bourbon barbecue sauce -- just bliss!

Bold, spicy and flavorful. Very tasty but not my favorite rib recipe. Used a gas grill with the indirect cooking method. Ribs were tender but may have needed to cook longer to actually fall off the bone. I also used the rub for grilled fish tacos (4 forks!). The rub was wonderful on the fish and I received several compliments and requests for the recipe.

Very good! I've also prepared these ribs in the oven and they are very good. The rub is versatile as is the bourbon barbeque sauce. The sauce was great on grilled chicken breasts. I keep a supply of the rub in my cabinet at all times!

Very tasty and very easy. Instructions sound complicated, but it is basic grilling. Ribs tasted very good, but did not "fall off the bone" like they really should. Recipe not as bad as one reviewer complained - do not use a gas grill.

This recipe was beyond great - in fact, I made it two nights in a row. It's really easy despite the "mind-numbing" barbecue instructions, as one reviewer described - we just followed our normal barbecue procedures and everything came out perfectly. The sauce alone would be fabulous over chicken, which I'm going to try next time. (For those who like a less-spicy sauce, you could try cutting back to 1 tablespoon of red pepper sauce.)

Absolutely love this recipe! I first made it last year when it came out and we couldn't believe how great it tasted! The rub is definitely different, and the sauce is perfect. We've used both the rub and sauce on steaks and pork chops with great results. The rub is also good on chops or london broils by itself and the sauce is great for chicken! I've had a lot of people ask for the recipe - both the rub and sauce are a staple in our house.

Finger Lickin Good! We are BBQ lovers. We really enjoyed these ribs. We used our favorite BBQ sauce on them (Montgomery Inn BBQ Sauce from Cincinnati, OH). We can't wait to make them again.

LOVED this recipe! EVERYONE I've ever served this to raved about this excellent recipe! The dry dub WILL NOT dry out the ribs as another critic claimed, and the bbq sauce is absolutely sweet, smoky and spicy at the same time --- it is HEAVEN! Thank you for sharing this with us!!!

I live in So. California and barbecue or smoke meat on a regular basis. This was the worst rib receipe I have made! Unfortunately if was for July 4th. The salt dried out the meat, other spices gave a poor tasting coating. REQUIRED barbecue sauce to cover up the taste. I Cooked on a gas grill on minimum heat so it wasn't too much heat that was the cause. Just a bad receipe. This is the first receipe I have cooked on this web site that I haven't liked. Others have been great and cook at least one of their receipes each week.

The best ribs ever. I put mine in a low oven for a couple of hours, then on the grill until the meat is really pulling away from the bone, another couple of hours. We've had them twice since Memorial Day and again for the 4th. Awesome.

Wow! I have no grill of my own, but I do ribs in the oven from time to time. Wasn't sure if these would work as well that way, but they did. My friend and I were in a hurry, so we probably ate them before we should have. I reheated the leftovers in foil in the oven for quite a while, and they were much more tender. But either way, the sauce was great. I can't wait to try it on my boyfriend, he likes things with a bit of a spciy kick, which these had (but not too bad for wimps like me, either)!

This is an excellent sauce and the ribs, done on a charcoal smoker were a big hit. Thanks to the reviews I used a longer cooking time. I also tried it with pork chops on a gas grill and this worked well also. I did omit the salt from the rub though, as my dad's diet is restricted. It was perfect without it.

One of the best ways to cook ribs. I'd recommend using slightly less rub than the recipe calls for. Also, I cooked them for MUCH longer (about 4 hours) at 250 F rather than 275.

I like to try different rib recipes (chili recipes, steak recipes...etc.)....this one was pretty good. To the cook from Toronto, the lower rack is the little one the coals rest on and the upper rack is the large one the food rests on. Also, the recipe isn't complicated just described in mind-numbing detail....which comes in handy for those less experienced i'd imagine. If you haven't already tried the recipe since your post, I say give it a shot and you'll be rewarded! Also, the charcoal chimney is a mesh metal device shaped like a vertical standing tube in which charcoal can be easily prepared without using flavor tainting charcoal lighting fluid. Definitely slow cook the ribs longer than the recipe recommends. If you keep the temp. in range you can easily double the time and make them as tender as possible.

The BBQ sauce was very good, but we didn't care for the ribs. They came out much too salty. We cooked them in a gas grill with wood chips at the prescribed temperature for about an hour and half, but they never got tender... But it was probably user error on the ribs.

This was excellent! The barbecue sauce was easy to make and delicious. I made these on my gas grill, as did another reviewer. I kept the temperature between 275 and 325 and smoked them for 3 hours. Next time, I will smoke them longer - although certainly tender, they weren't "falling off the bone" the way I prefer. This recipe is MUCH better than the highly-rated ribs with bourbon-mustard sauce, in my opinion.

I'd lke to try making this-- is it just me or is the procedure hopelessly complicated? We have the standard Weber called for here, but have no idea what is meant by upper racks, lower racks etc.... help! I see one rack on my bbq. Don't own a chimmney starter-- do they mean racks on the starter?? THANKS TO THE COOK FROM TRAVERSE CITY-- I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THESE!

Yeah, baby. Ribs the way I like em. The sauce is great too, but I added a little cider vinegar for some extra tang. I utilized my gas grill for this. It's a two burner, so I used only one and placed the ribs on the other side. I also placed some soaked wood chips in a bread pan and placed this directly on the burner. The whole process took about 5 hours but the ribs were out of this world. To the cook from Toronto: The lower rack is what you place your charcoal on. If yours is missing, you should be able to pick one up where they sell Weber grills. A chimney is a metal cylinder used to start charcoal without lighter fluid. You could start your charcoal with lighter fluid, just be sparing with the fluid.
