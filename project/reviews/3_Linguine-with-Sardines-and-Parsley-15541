I agree that it's a super easy dish and great for pantry staples, but it isn't that flavorful. I added red pepper, Parmesan, and pine nuts.

Did an offshoot of this since all we had was canned sardines in tomato sauce. The pasta on its own was nice despite my going a bit bonkers with the red pepper. Next time I'll do the plain sardines but my kids really liked this version.

Easy and delicious. I added chopped fennel and used dry champagne instead of the white wine. Quick and tasty mid- week meal.

I make a variation of this dish with artichoke hearts and really enjoy it. With canned sardines, dry pasta, and frozen artichokes, this is a great dish to make with pantry staples.

Easy to make. Good if you like sardines. The wine I used ended up being very tart when reduced. Adding butter and salt to the sauce cut the tartness.

My husband gave it a zero, I thought it was "so-so", so I am rating it a 1. It is simple, and the first few bites are good, but the fishiness quickly becomes overwhelming. Maye adding some other things (like the parmesan suggested by another reviewer) would help a lot.

The sauce was okay, but nothing special. My family ate the pasta, but don't want it again. I lightly fried the sardines as per a suggestion on the Fried Sardines with Penne recipe and those we all enjoyed. Oh, I added a few strands of saffron and that didn't help, but the red pepper flakes were a good addition.

Having just spent some time in Sicily, where I fell in love with this dish, it can be a little more original if pine nuts and a little saffron are added. A little dried red chili pepper brings out a lot of flavor. Of course it's a million times better with fresh sardines but this will do. Buono gusto!
