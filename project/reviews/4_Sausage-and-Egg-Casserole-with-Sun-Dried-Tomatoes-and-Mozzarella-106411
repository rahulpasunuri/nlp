This was delicious. I made it for Christmas brunch and everyone at the table raved about it. I followed the recipe closely, only adding a little extra sausage and some crumbled goat cheese on top instead of mozzarella. Will definitely make this again, perhaps with mushrooms next time. It was also very pretty on the table.

I made this casserole for Christmas breakfast and it was delicious. I added mushrooms and spinach and included fontina and gruyere cheese. I also broiled it for a few minutes at the end to get the cheese on top nice and brown. I will definitely be making this again!

I have made this several times, trying various sausages (turkey, mild italian, spicy, etc) and love it every time. The only substitutions I have made are whole milk instead of half and half, and plain yoghourt (2%, drained) instead of whipping cream. And sometimes, if I don't have a recipe to use the egg whites, I use 8 whole eggs.

It is Badger football season once again. Early game always calls for this recipe. It is a big hit for our group of fans! Usually use my own oven roasted tomatoes. Otherwise, the dish is as written.

Rating: 4
A really great recipe. We love exactly as written, especially for Christmas morning, and all the variations we have made thus far. Favorite variation is subbing out half the sausage for chopped artichoke hearts and upping the amount of fresh parsley. It also stands up really well to varying the amounts of cream and half & half when one is feeling a little calorie guilty...stupid skinny jeans.

This has been a hit year after year at our Memorial Day Brunch on the porch. This year we went through 2 regular versions and 1/2 of a veggie version. I follow the recipe but with these adjustments: spicy chicken sausage, I use whole raw milk rather than half and half (but keep the cream), I reduced the amount of cheese to 1.5 cups (it's plenty), and a lot more parsley. Adding basil if you have some fresh lying around would be great as well. I've also used onion rather than shallots when I didn't have shallots around and found it didn't make that much difference, although the shallots are a bit more sophisticated. Next year I'll increase the number of casseroles to 3...people LOVE this recipe!

Made this for a Mom's group brunch. It was the first casserole completely gone and the only one that was completely eaten. I would say that made it a hit. Also you can make it with spicy sausage if you like.

Rating: 4
Wonderful for guests because you can do most of the prep the night before. I recommend using fresh basil instead of parsley, 2 cups half and half (no whipping cream), 8 eggs rather than the 3 yolks, a little more sun-dried tomatoes (a whole small jar is fine), and go easy on salt (if any) because the sausage is salty. It takes longer to bake,about 45 minutes or so. It's really tasty; my guests loved it and I felt great! Will definitely make it again as soon as I can.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe often with just a few changes: I purposely substitute the parsley with cilantro, use a spicy/hot Italian turkey sausage, and even make it zippier with a little red pepper flakes in the meat mixture and a little Cayenne pepper in the wet ingredients. It has never been too spicy - not even for people who say they do not like spicy food. The extra spice, along with the sun-dried tomatoes, makes it a very tasty dish. Without fail, whenever I serve it almost everyone wants the recipe.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I accidentally bought cilantro instead of parsley so I left it out. I made two versions, one with chicken italian sausage and one with pork Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, and liked the chicken sausage version better.

Rating: 4
This sounded great but I worried that one pound of meat for eight servings didn't sound like enough. I added two pounds of ground sausage and it turned out great! You could certainly substitute other items for the sundried tomato (mushroom, peppers, etc.) but I think the shallots and parsley were key elements to this casserole being so tasty!

Served this for dinner with a side of steamed vegetables, and it was a big hit with my husband and two kids. I used more sun-dried tomatoes than the recipe called for (I finished off the jar, which came to a little less than a cup), and I added mushrooms because I had them on hand. A surprisingly satisfying dinner.

I have to be honest - this was okay, but nothing amazing, truthfully. I had high hopes for this recipe after seeing such glowing reviews and ratings, but was disappointed with the finished product, and was left wishing I had decided upon a strata or fritata instead. I followed the recipe to a T, and while it was good, of course, the entire dish was wanting. Kind of a bummer...

Made this for Christmas Day breakfast. Received RAVE reviews! A few of my guests were vegetarians. So, I substitued the Italian sweet sausage with veggie sausage patties; breaking them up with a fork into small pieces. (I used Morning Star Farms "Original Sausage Patties"). It was still delicious! I also made the "Eggnog French Toast with Cranberry-Apple Compote" recipe which is on this site (huge hit as well). The two went very well together... so I highly recommend pairing them! The advantage to both recipes is that, for the most part, they can be made a day ahead. It worked great because it gave me more time to socialize and open presents, instead of being stuck in the kitchen all morning! ;-)

I make this every year for Christmas. I brown the sausage the night before. Last year I did not have sun-dried tomatoes so I added chopped roasted red peppers (from a jar). Turns out my family liked that much better. The colors are pretty with the red and green. This dish tastes great reheated.

Great recipe. Nice to find one w/o bread or potatoes. I added chopped artichoke hearts (same amount as the tomatoes), 2 additional whole eggs and added an additional 1/2 pound of sausage. I also used half spicy and half mild and fat free half and half. Flavors were wonderful. Might use buttermilk instead of heavy cream next time. But will use this recipe again and again! Next time

If you are looking for eggs for breakfast, this is not the dish for you. Just looking at the recipe I should have known. Between the yolks, cream, half and half, and cheese, you have 4 1/2 cups of rich dairy added to 5 eggs in a 9x13 pan. I wanted eggs to feed a hungry group of college students. What I got was cheesy sausage. ...Not that cheesy sausage isn't tasty, it's just not eggs, or egg casserole. It could have used about 7-8 more egges.

Thought this was terrific-one of the best brunch dishes I've made. Added extra 1/4 lb. of sausage. Love that there's no bread/crust. Flavors were terrific. Took longer to bake-approx. 45-50 min. until it was set. Cooled for 15 min. Delicious!!

Try this recipe! This is my favorite recipe of all time. No exaggeration. I only eat it twice a year myself because it is ridiculously fatty, but I love to make it for brunches (with french toast casserole and a citrus dessert), new moms, and potlucks. I make it Christmas morning with lemon ricotta pancakes or apple-cherry pastries. I may just look forward to it a little more than the presents. I often use 1.5 times the recipe in a 13x9in pan. Use sage sausage and add 1 T maple syrup to the sausage mixture before putting into the pan. I use tomatoes packed in Italian herbs and oil. I also serve it as a lunch with garlic bread and salad. I have made it about a dozen times, and each of those times, people have asked for the recipe. This crustless quiche is packed with gorgeous flavor, like a delightful breakfast lasagna. It has improved my quality of life.

I put this recipe in my recipe book 6 years ago and just got around to making it today for an impromptu breakfast gathering. Very easy and quick. I used the precooked sausage links (chopped) as I didn't have the type of sausage in the recipe. It didn't need to cook as long and still tasted great. I also used egg beaters with no problem. I let it sit in the warm oven til I was ready to serve.

Incredible!!! I made this for Mother's Day Breakfast. I followed the directions with the exception of the garlic and shallots (omitted them), added mushrooms, spinach, and chopped sundried tomatoes (which I sauteed wtih the Sausage after it was 95% cooked) and used Parsley paste ( you can get in the vegetable section of your grocery store). I drained the sausage mushroom spinach

I make this recipe all the time, usually substituting 2% milk for the half and half. I sometimes will mix in some fat-free mozzarella and some eggbeaters if for my husband and I, but definitely all "real" cheese for parties.

I definitely recommend making it in advance though, so the mushrooms have enough time to soak up the flavor. Always a crowd pleaser, and has become a Mother's Day tradition!

I have made this recipe on numerous occasions as listed, but last time, tried to do it from memory, no cream, so used 1 cup fat free mocha mix and 1 cup non fat milk for creams, used sweet italian turkey sausage and fresh basil instead of parsley, also, forgot the shallots so used green onion. My guests LOVED it and said they wouldn't change a thing.

Truly exceptional! My house guests gave rave reviews ("best egg and sausage casserole ever"). I am allergic to gluten and am so thrilled to finally find a breakfast casserole I can eat. I used 1 C whole milk and 1 C whipping cream (basically, 2 C half & half), and replaced the 3 eggs yolks with 2 whole eggs. I also used turkey sausage because we don't eat pork. Next time, I want to try using a more flavorful cheese like gruyere or emmental. I'll make this again and again!

Made it the first time according to the recipe and it was very good.

Excellent! I used all half and half instead of the combination of half and half and whipping cream, and the dish was still rich and delicious.

I will make this recipe again (many times) as well as try it with other combinations (bratwurst, cheddar, and sage, for instance).

Pretty good - the sausage, shallots and garlic smell wonderful when they're sizzling together.

Not quite worth the staggering calorie count.

This is the best breakfast dish I've ever made. It was extremely easy to prepare. It could've taken another 6-8 minutes in the oven because the eggs hadn't gotten quite firm enough for my taste in the center.

This was a good dish and I'd make it again, though it didn't knock my socks off like previous reviewers. I found the recipe and read the reviews, but then printed the recipe without adding the comments before my husband cooked the dish, so he didn't know to use 8 whole eggs and cut the salt as previous reviewers encouraged. Definitely do use 8 full eggs, maybe 1-2 more to get a stronger egg component to the dish - it's needed. We also thought it would be great to add spinach and mushrooms. We served it with sourdough english muffins, mixed fruit and vanilla yogurt since we needed something a bit sweet to cut the salty/savory flavor of the casserole.

Rating: 4
This was very good. I took ideas from some reviewers and subbed ricotta for the whipping cream, and used a third cup of half-and-half along with two-thirds cup of skim milk. It still tasted plenty rich to me. I also used chicken apple sausage instead of Italian sausage. It was a bit meaty for me and I would like to try making a vegetarian version to see if it still has enough flavor. The sun-dried tomatoes add a lot of zest, though I am not a huge sun-dried tomato fan normally.

Excellent recipe. Very easy, too. I made the meat filling the night before my Easter brunch. In the morning, I whipped up the egg mixture (I used all 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream because that's what I had on hand) and while it baked we hunted Easter eggs. Well, everyone loved it and went back for seconds. I served it with thick-cut sourdough toasts and cantaloupe and strawberry fruit salad. Leftovers were good microwaved for breakfast the next morning.

I made two batches of this for a brunch for 10 adults. The first tray I made was done exactly as the recipe was written-- it was the preferred choice. The other tray was made with chicken sausage to suit a non- pork eater and was made with basil instead of parsley. I thought both were very good and the perfect brunch choice. For reviewers who complained of the dish being too heavy, I suspect they didn't read the ingredients before baking-- anything loaded with cheese, cream and sausage is bound to be filling. The eggs set up perfectly in my oven with the recommended cooking time.

This is my favorite egg casserole recipe. I have even made it low fat on occasion with turkey italian sausage and egg substitue (of course, tastes much better with the real thing).

EXCELLENT & SIMPLE!! I am so happy with this recipe! I made this recipe yesterday to give to a friend, and made another for my family. I used 8 full eggs instead of the 5 and 3 suggested in the recipe, and I used a mixture of mozzarella and colby/jack shredded cheese. I prepared the sausage mixture exactly, but decided to wrap it all into a paper towel to remove some of the excess grease. The result was really tasty, and my picky husband even commented on how many yummy flavors there were in every bite! 3 of my 4 very finicky children also devoured it. (The hold- out doesn't like sausage!) It looks just like the picture, smells awesome, and is going to become a standard meal in our house for sure! Perfect for Lunch or Dinner, excellent for any Brunch, and would be a great dish for any pot-luck. YUM!

I've been looking for an easy egg dish that I can make ahead and eat for breakfast during the week. This works great! After baking and cooling, I portioned and froze it. It tasted great re-heated. (I warmed it in the microwave for a couple minutes on 60% power.) I made small modifications: used all 8 eggs rather than the 5 + 3 yolks and substituted whole milk for half and half. I am eager to try some variations that include more veggies, or use it as the filling of an egg sandwich.

I've made this dish several times; the result has always been rave reviews. I typically use twive the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, and like the mix up the grated mozzarella with some grated jack or muenster or even provolone. This is a great brunch dish with a light spinach salad.

I made this for our annual Easter Brunch this year. It will be on next year's menu as well. My husband really liked it. I added a bit more sun-dried tomatoes and used 1 cup whole milk and one cup half and half to cut the fat content. It needed about 10 more minutes to set up, but was very tasty! Will try topping with parmesan next time I make it.

I made this for the second time for Easter brunch. A BIG HIT! And easy to make. I used a cheddar/jack combo instead of mozzarella. Would be great with chopped green bell peppers and olives, mushrooms etc. for a pizza-style breakfast casserole.

Excellent and filling. Made a lower-cal version by using apple-chicken sausage, 1 cup 2% milk and 1 cup low-fat ricotta cheese instead of the cup of half and half and whipping cream. Everyone loved it.

This is such a great dish to prepare -- variations and all. I've made it several times, tweaking it a bit each time depending on what cheeses/sausages etc are available. But one thing that has been consistent is that it takes way longer to bake than 30 minutes. I've made it in different ovens, and each time it has taken the better part of an hour for the eggs to set. Otherwise it's a definite keeper!

Doubled the recipe for a large group. It was very well received. Just a suggestion, if you double the recipe, use two containers instead of one. I didn't think I'd ever get the center to set up in the large baking dish I used.

Very nice and different egg casserole. You can experiment with different ingredients (hot sausage, mild sausage, sweet sausage, different veggies, etc.) until you find the combination that suits your family best. Makes more than 8 servings...probably more like 10-12 b/c it's a hearty dish. With some minor modifications, it works very well for a low-carb diet (i.e., no sundried tomatoes). A definite keeper!

I made this as one of two main dishes for a brunch, and didn't even get to try it because it was gone so fast! Everyone raved about it, and most went back for seconds (or even thirds). I used half sweet turkey sausage and half sweet Italian, and 2 cups half & half instead of 1 cup half & half and 1 cup whipping cream. I made the sausage the day before and chilled overnight. It's worth whisking the eggs until there is a fair amount of air in them - people loved that they tasted so light and fluffy.

Made this for an outdoor breakfast. Used a smoked chicken/apple sausage-people loved it,but I might not use again as casings are difficult to remove. would prefer a sweet turkey sausage as suggested before. Also used only 1 C. no-fat sour cream+ 1 C. 1/2 & 1/2 - no whipping cream Used sun dried tomatoes + 1/2 c. (or more) roasted red and yellow peppers. It was a big hit!! Would most certainly make it again!!

I have made this recipe several times pretty much as-is (heavy cream and all!) and love it. I do add an extra egg and a little more sundried tomatoes and sausage than called for. Great for company -- the whole casserole can be made the night before (actually tastes even better) and then reheated. It always gets rave reviews! I'm currently on the South Beach diet and make a lighter version of this for myself. I use non-oil packed sun dried tomatoes (saute them a little with the shallots to soften them) and a large carton of Egg Beaters. A cup or so of fat free half and half gives it the creaminess of the original recipe, but the casserole is still very good without it. I do splurge and use regular cheese though! This reheats very well, so I make it ahead and then have it thoughout the week for breakfast before work -- low carb doesn't get much quicker than that!

i would make this again for breakfast for overnight guests because you can make the meat the day before then mix the egg mixture in the morning in 5 minutes or less. i sprinkled a bit of my homemade cajun seasoning on the top for a little extra kick

Made it on a weeknight when I was crunched for time. I drained the grease from the pan before adding garlic and shallots, and used 2 cups sour cream. It was very well received, and great at breakfast this morning. It is the ultimate comfort food...might be more sensible with turkey sausage to reduce the fat.

I too used 2 c half & half, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Next time, I would double the meat layer, as suggested by others & be sure not to skimp on the tomatoes. I preferred this at room temperature. It seemed to have much more flavor, (I even ate it cold the next morning.) Good!

I think this recipe is really good... I accidently added all the cheese with the sauce and used only half and half in place of the cream. I found it to be very salty though. I'd probably take out the salt completely since the SD tomatoes and sausage add enough flavor.

Have made this dish many times due to the repeated pleadings of my fiance. He is a very picky eater and as a result I have never included the sun-dried tomatoes or parsley, but it's still excellent. Even a large dish such as this between the two of us is half gone after dinner, and all leftovers are always eaten. This is an especially great dish to make for weekends away at our cabin because it is fairly simple and quick, and can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Takes care of at least two meals! This is definitely a family keeper.

This was good and simple. I too used hot sausage. My family loved it and husband brought it to lunch next 2 days. I would like it with a sauce and think that stewed tomatoes boiled down with some garlic, oregano, and basil, and a bit of cream would top it (see the recipe for SOUTHERN SAUSAGE SOUFFLE on this site). The only change I made was to double the cheese and I used a mix of Munster, Parmesan, cheddar, and whatever else I had.

This is a great recipe. I usually make two and we eat it every morning for a week. I've served this at brunches I've catered and have made it for friends who are under the weather, etc because it reheats so well. Great to make when you have a busy week ahead. I've not come across anyone who hasn't loved it. If you're making it for company, cut in smaller pieces--it is rich.

Because of time constraints, I had to cook this the night before and reheat it the microwave the next morning to serve it. Also, I found last minute that I was out of sun dried tomatoes and so only made it with cooked, crumbled turkey Italian sausage and shredded sharp cheddar. After reheating it the next morning, I was skeptical and came close to apologizing as I placed it on the buffet. But even though there were so many other tempting treats at the brunch table, this casserole was the only dish that was scraped clean! Everybody had at least two servings. Even without the sun-dried tomatoes - which would have made it more interesting - the texture was fabulous and creamy and the sausage and cheese hit the spot. I plan on using the base, at least, to make endless variations on an easy do-ahead meal.

This is a very good brunch recipe. Looks good, tastes delicious. Used bulk sausage (w/sage) since my supermarket didn't carry sweet Italian sausage (the nerve!), and used 1/2 C. whipping cream and 1 1/2 C. half and half, and the results were very nice. It wasn't ready at the end of the cooking time, and company was waiting, so I turned up the oven 50 degrees and cooked it another 10 minutes. Am looking forward to reheating the leftovers for dinner tomorrow night. I will definitely make this again.

Made this for my boyfriend's mom for mother's day brunch and it was definitely a success. Intended to follow the recipe, with the only substitution being that of whole milk for half-and-half, based on earlier recommendations. However, aforementioned boyfriend forgot to put in whipping cream, leaving the whole milk and the eggs as the only liquid. It was still great-very flavorful, with a more intense flavor than if they cream had been added, I imagine. I'll try it the "right" way sometime, but for folks interested in cutting a big chunk of fat out of the recipe, try this...and I'm sure Egg Beaters would work great, too.

I've made this twice now and brought the house down both times. This is a keeper and works well no matter what you have to use in your fridge. First time, I prepared it by the letter of the recipe and the second time I omitted the sundried tomatoes and garlic and still received rave reviews. I actually thought the second version was even better as a brunch item (breakfast sausage, shallots, sauteed spinach, portobello mushrooms and roasted red peppers... I kept milk, egg and cheese ingredients as called for). Served with breakfast breads and Citrus Salad with Mint Sugar from Epicurious... A hit!

It was a HIT! I made this dish for Easter Sunday and it was incredible! I added a cup of chopped asparagus which really added another layer of flavor -- nice -- and even though I accidentally bought Monterey Jack cheese instead of Mozzerella, they taste almost identical anyway, it turned out perfectly! Very tasty, really moist and fluffy, LOTS of complients. Served it with a gorgonzolla-walnut salad; great combo.

Well this wasn't quite what I expected. It turned out VERY rich and heavy - you wouldn't want to eat too large a portion.

This dish was a hit at a friend's baby shower. I would definitely make it again.

Doubled this recipe for a large crowd, thinking I probably wouldn't end up using the second pan. Boy, was I wrong. My guests quickly devoured the first dish, and eagerly awaited the second one from the oven. It, too, disappeared quickly, with many compliments. This is the best egg/brunch dish I've found yet--easy to make, distinct flavor from the sundried tomatoes, and soooooo good. A definite keeper. Several guests asked me for the recipe.

Have made this several times and have received rave reviews each time. Easy to make. Sometimes I add fresh mushrooms in with the garlic, shallots, and sausage. We don't eat a lot of pork at our house so use turkey sausage instead. Very versatile recipe

Originally made this exactly to the recipe and was wonderful. Since then it's become a staple but we've made a few changes. We swap roasted red bell peppers for the sun dried tomato. Regular breakfast sausage (the kids like that better). We also stir it a bit before cooking so it's not so layered and we put a mix of parmesan and mozzarella.

I made this for overnight guests and I appreciated not having to get up at the crack of dawn to have breakfast ready! My husband and I are from Texas, as was our company, so substituted smoked jalapenos for the tomatoes and used cheddar cheese - it was terrific. very rich and satisfying and creamy..

Absolutely wonderful! A perfect brunch buffet dish--everyone raved. I used precooked Turkey and Sund-Dried Tomato Sausage that I ground in the food processor. I noticed it was a tiny bit watery on the bottom--anyone else notice that? It was fine when I rewarmed leftovers...maybe it needed to sit longer? Anyway, a great recipe.

Thanks to all previous readers for hints. I agree with those who use all half and half. I've made it twice, successfully making a "recipe and a half" and baking it in a large casserole - perfect for 12 people. I served it with a wild rice and shrimp salad, a fruit salad, and homemade bread.

I tried this recipe for a football tailgate party and it was a BIG hit! I made the first half the night before like the directions say and then whipped the eggs and the creme together the next morning per directions. The second time I made it - I did not have any whipping creme, so I used all half and half and liked it even better!! Definately a keeper.

Rating: 4
This recipe is DELICIOUS! I have made it for a few cottage weekends and it is ALWAYS a huge hit with everyone. Half can be made ahead of time, so in the morning all you need to do is take 10 mins to whip up the egg mixture -- perfect for those who don't like to get up too early on the weekend! This recipe is definately a keeper. You will love it!

Scrumptious! Very easy to make and works well for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. I made this for a quick weeknight dinner and then we ate it again for breakfast :) Any kind of sausage works well...

Yum!! Made the recipe as written (which is unusual for me) and it was great. I did have to increase the baking time by about 5 minutes. Made the night before and it reheated nicely the next morning. Terrific brunch recipe.

I brought this to a brunch and it was a big hit. I altered the recipe a little (since I can't help but monkey with recipes.) I added a tablespoon of minced fresh basil and about a cup of grated parmesano reggiano. I also added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper and about a teaspoon of mustard powder to the egg mix. They added a little heat but not too much. I also used two cups of heavy cream instead of one cup of cream and one cup of half and half, making this a perfectly acceptable dish for people on the Atkins diet. I baked it for about 32 minutes, and it probably could have used another five, but that might just be my oven.

I attended a bridal shower this past weekend and the hostess made this. It was just yummy and I could not eat enough. A number of us asked for the recips.

Everyone loves this dish! I substitute a combination of spicy and herbed turkey sausage for the Italian sausage. I also use 1-1/2 cups of 2% milk and 1/2 cup of creme fraiche or plain lowfat yogurt (depending how decadent I'm feeling)instead of half and half and whipping cream. Served as suggested, it makes a very nice meal for guests.

The only chage I made was to use all half and half and not whipping cream. it was delicious. needed 37 minutes in my oven to get golden brown on top. it was also wonderful left over! I might make a double batch next time just for the next day!

Rating: 4
Very easy to put together -- particularly if you prepare the sausage the day before -- and very good. Leftovers are also good the next day. I did substitute 1 cup of skim milk for the half and half because the cream and eggs were already so decadent and I can't imagine there was a noticeable difference in the taste and texture.

Pretty much a typical breakfast casserole, though I made it for dinner this evening. My husband really liked it because of the sausage. I will probably make it again because it was easy and versatile. Could cut the fat content a little. All I did different was to drain the sausage after cooking and add a small amount of olive oil to saute the shallots and garlic. Then added the sausage back and continued as stated.

I made this for my fiance who is on a low carb diet. I made per recipe except for using all 1/2 and 1/2. He loved it. He usually requests no tomatoes, but he really enjoyed the texture of the sun-dried ones. I browned the sausage in a large, ovenproof nonstick skillet so I simply added the rest of the ingredients and baked. It was delish!

So easy to make and incredibly delicious. I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day and it was possibly even more delicious. I also used turkey sausage (hot). Highly recommended!

I'm not a vegetarian but I used Boca (bratwurst) sausages in this recipe instead of Italian sausage. After all cream, 1/2 and 1/2, cheese and sausage! Put it in the food processor with the garlic and shallots, added marjoram, oregano and even the teenager loved it. Also used 1% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2.

I made this for Easter Brunch. I used vegetarian sausage and it came out great!

YUM! This was great! I substituted whole milk for the half & half to cut out some of the fat. I also used fresh tomatoes because I don't care for sun-dried. I also added some cheddar with the mozz. This is a great dish to make the night before and just pop it into the oven in the morning. I worried that it would be really greasy with all the cheese and meat, but it was surprisingly fluffy and had a really nice texture. I will definitely make this again!

Oooohh my word!! This was so good. Served it for a ladies' brunch. My house smelled profusely of garlic...sort of worried it might be too much for breakfast. But once we dug in all worries were gone. Six women finished the whole pan, so make extra!! I think I'll try it without all the cream, just for conscience sake. Magnifique!

I made this for the folks at work and they loved it. However, I changed quite a bit: used turkey sausage cut out the sun-dried tomatoes used onions instead of shallots and garlic, as I thought that would be nicer for breakfast Added seasoned croutons (like for stuffing) - 1 bag I used the whole 8 eggs, and didn't separate - also added a bit more milk because of the croutons soaking up so much liquid used all half & half and no heavy cream

I made 3 casseroles to serve 19 adults / 16 children (under 2 yrs old) for Saturday morning brunch. 1 whole casserole was leftover. This was a BIG hit! I substituted veal sausage for Italian sausage as some of my guests are not pork eaters. It was excellent with this change and I would definitely do this again if the situation warranted. Everyone wanted the recipe! I am so happy to fine epicurious ... I was going to serve a purchased quiche until I discovered they were $20 a pie and I would need at least 4. This recipe saved the bank. I'm not saying this recipe was inexpensive to make, just so much more economical than the alternative and frankly, much more tasty.

I made this recipe as instructed, but next time I would make changes. It seemed to need more texture - perhaps some sauteed onions or peppers, or parboiled potatoes. It also could perhaps use a crust of some sort - even cubes of bread at the bottom of the pan before pouring. We found that the flavor improved greatly after waiting 24, 48, or 72 hours. I agree with another reviewer that this could probably be prepared with lower-fat ingredients for a delicious result.

This was a delicious egg casserole. I made it exactly as directed in the recipe and my guests and I loved it. You could however, easily change the type of cheese or the type of sausage for a totally different (but probably just as great a taste). I thought that the sun dried tomatoes made the recipe.

For those of us on low-carb diets, this is an excellent find. I thought it was very tasty and re-heated very well.

In an attempt to make this recipe healthier, I made a number of substitutions: soy "sausage" in place of regular sausage, reduced fat Italian cheese blend(with mozzarella and provolone)instead of full fat mozzarella, and 1% milk to replace the half and half and whipping cream. It was delicious! The flavors were very complimentary to each other! I can only image how rich and decadent the original recipe is(although my variation gave me an idea).
