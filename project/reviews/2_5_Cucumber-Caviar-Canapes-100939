Quick, easy, and delicious. I used a pastry/frosting bag thingy to squeeze the sour cream out to make the presentation nicer. It worked well. The only thing I would change is to buy better caviar rather than the regular grocery store variety.

This makes a wonderful presentation for Christmas...peel the cukes into vertical stripes. Cut them into 3/4" to 1" towers with the top on a slant. Hollow out the seed inside leaving just enough for a solid bottom, fill with sour cream and top with red caviar. Serve with champagne or prosecco!

This is very attractive-looking and I would make it again for this reason. I would, however, serve it along side some crackers with caviar, too so that people can also enjoy an intense caviar flavor. The water in the cucumber doesn't "carry" the flavor of the caviar very well. Serving just a few for attractiveness(and for those who don't love caviar) with other canapes makes for a colorful presentation.

Haven't tried this with cucumber, but one of my favorite caviar recipes is artichoke bottoms with sour cream and caviar. Wonderful, I could eat it all night, and I'll make it again this New Years.

It was absolutely one of the worst things I have ever put in my mouth before. It made me gag it was so bad.
