These were very good. Do not over bake!

I love this cookie, added some ground ginger. Also, I do nor do well with roll and cut so I used a small cookie scoop to drop into granulated sugar and coat, this did not require parchment.

I would never make this recipe again. The "dough" was more like a batter. After reading several reviews I learned I was not the only person who had this experience. I added some extra flour and another egg and ended up with a cake-like cookie, but nothing that could be rolled out.

Disappointing - not that strong (and I fresh ground my spices and added a little more). However, the worst thing was the texture - hard to roll out - and BOY, do these things spread. Also, I was disappointed that you did not get any of the chewy-ness of the candied ginger, as it was ground to a powder. There are better ginger snaps out there, I know it!

These are good but the definitive BEST ginger cookie on this site is the Ginger Spice Cookie (B.A. March 2000). I have been making them for years for my customers (have a catering business) and they are the bomb! I am always trying new recipes but always go back to that one. They freeze well and I make them in 2" sizes which people love for parties and teas.

These cookies did not turn out well at all. I added extra flour (1/2 cup) after reading another review and they baked into a big blob. Very disappointing.

I read all the reviews before making the cookies. I did add 1/2 a cup of flour. measured 5 spice closer to 2 tsp. I didn't frost the cookies because I wanted them to stay crunchy. We didn't even try rolling them out, just rolled the dough into a ball and smash to 1/8". I wouldn't mind some extra spice but as a cookie to bring to parties, I would leave as is. The cookie went over very well, great flavor. I would like a tip on chopping the ginger, the food processor didn't do a great job so I ended up chopping it which wasn't as fine as it should have been. As for the golden syrup, I looked it up online and it was suggested as a substitute for Caro syrup and something else. I found it at my store (pricy). I was surprized at how thick it was. I measured using a measuring cup and a knife to level it off as I would flour. Making the whole thing in a food processor was a great idea. Thanks to everyone who wrote reviews.

These are great, and a good balance in the all-very-sweet cookie box. I'm not sure why some say they aren't flavorful or intense; I guess it's the quality of your spices (or maybe not letting the dough refrigerate long enough). Mine were quite intense. I just took balls from the dough and flattened them into shape, which worked quite easily. Some cookie eaters preferred them plain, some with icing -- but with icing, I'd make them a little thicker.

I have made these three times now and found it easiest to roll the dough into 2 logs, chill, and thinly slice, about 1/4". I then top with Sugar in the Raw before baking. I also add more 5 spice and ginger for an intense flavor. The dough also freezes well, just slice and bake.

Ok...Certainly could not get mine to look like yours, BUT they were very easy. They were not spicy at all, which was disappointing, but they have a nice buttery ginger flavor. I would make them again....

What a wimpy cookie! None of the delicious heat of a real gingersnap-more like a puffy sugar cookie with just enough undertone to be annoying. Not for me.

Food processor broke, so I chopped the ginger and added it at the end. Adds a little more bite of ginger. Everyone RAVES about this cookie! I make it several times a year without frosting.

If this helps with deep red, start by coloring it pink (I use Americolor Soft Gel Paste as many consider it better tasting than Wilton). After you have it a good shade of pink, add red (I use Americolor Super Red). Then let it sit overnight to deepen in color.

I have made these twice now and they have been perfect and delicious both times without any changes to the recipe. We did have to use a ton of red wilton gel color, but one tip for the icing is to make one thicker version to pipe a thin outline and then "flood" with a thinned version. This also helped with decorating them like the photo shows, though most weren't quite as pro looking! My only difficulty was finding the golden syrup-- finally got it at some schmancy international gourmet store. Oh, and don't count on cutting these into fancy shapes-- they expand as they cook, so the simpler the better.

Made by my sister- in-law, these were wonderful! She used the print recipe, not the online version so I don't know if there were any changes. While her cookies were not iced, a tip for getting red icing is to use a lot of red gel color and let the icing sit for up to overnight. The color deepens.

love this cookie...made several batches last christmas. There is a misprint in the online recipe, dough should be rolled to 1/8" thick (not 3/4") We used red food color paste and achieved a beautiful red. Tasty and worth the effort! Will make them again this year!

I made the dough with an extra 1/2 cup of flour and refrigerate the it overnight. I had no problems rolling out and cutting the dough. I did as others suggested and rolled the cookies out to 1/4" instead of 3/4". Good flavor and texture. I tried to replicate the bright red color of the photos but with not luck. An intense shade of salmon pink was all I could achieve.

haven't made the recipe but in response to the person trying to make red icing, always use Wilton no taste red, otherwise you get a strong chemical taste. you should be able to get a vibrant red although it can take a lot of red color paste (1 oz of gel to 1 cup icing) to get the red you want. see www.wilton.com/cake/icing/pastecolors.cfm

Just curious, especially in regard to the comment below about the "stunning" decoration. Did anyone actually try to replicate the cookies in the picture? Wondering, because we did not make these at christmas, but for valentines we remembered the striking red/white decorations and thought we'd try to mimic somewhat, though with the icing from the black and white cookie since we don't like the flavor of the powdered egg whites. Anyway, even though my wife uses the Wilton color gels rather than regular food color, the closest to "red" we could get--short of using a ridiculous amount of color--was a medium shade of pink. Did anyone else manage to achieve red, and if so, how?

The receipe sez 3/4" thickness which is way too thick. Should be more like 1/4"-1/2".

These were absolutely terrific. Doubled the spices though, ginger and five spice. Grandchildren loved decorating them. It took us 4 hours to do two batches but they were spectacular.

These were easy to make and very pretty if you do the decorative icing. The icing did overpower the cookie a little, but maybe I spread the icing a little thick. Also, the recipe said to roll the dough out to "3/4 inch". Seemed too thick, so I made mine thinner. Our Christmas guests were impressed.

If you follow the recipe exactly, you will end up with a batter, not a dough. I added another 1/2 cup of flour and was able to plop the dough into the plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a couple of days. It was easy to roll out and cut, and the cookies were quite delicious. Shame on Gourmet though; this was the second recipe from the December issue that had problems. (Fragrant Indian Brittle was the other. If you cook the brittle to the printed temperature, you will scorch the hell out of it). I don't know if the errors are due to bad testing or bad proofreading, but either way, I do a lot of baking for the holidays, and I count on Gourmet to give me recipes that work.

I was seduced by the beauty of the cookie, but didn't find it spicy or flavourful -- way too much effort for a so-so result at best. I ended up throwing the whole batch out -- with no protest from my partner! Shall I say it makes a better decoration than cookie?

These were a pain in the neck. You must work quickly because the dough is very soft to begin with, but becomes more so in moments. I had difficulty pulling up the scraps after using the cutter and I had added nearly a half cup more flour. HOWEVER, they are so delicious that I would definitely make them again. They have a thin, crunchy outside and a wonderful, chewy inside. I may next add a little cayenne or black pepper because I prefer just a little more heat. I haven't even iced them yet and I've eaten 3!

Loved the ease of making this entirely in the Cuisinart. I took other's advice and rolled them into balls & pressed them with the bottom of a glass. They were still a bit sticky, though. I ended up tossing the balls in a bit of flour before pressing them out. It worked great and didn't seem to affect their appearance.

We loved these cookies; they were very spicy and the texture is great - neither too cakey, or too hard. The decoration is stunning. Notes: if decorating, make sure the icing is not too stiff, otherwise decorating is difficult; around the consistency of honey is adequate. Also, we used a plastic straw to poke the holes through the cookies, which worked extremely well. Also, don't bother trying to make any sort of cut-out, as these cookies don't hold a detailed shape well.

These cookies were delicious! Fantastic flavor. The dough was difficult to form into a disk (other bakers had this problem--see below) but we just dumped it on some plastic wrap and tucked the edges around.

Sounded great when I read it; but the hunting down of the Lyle's syrup stymied me. I probably will check my food co-op if I think about it. Couldn't you have suggested a substitute? Karo? Maple syrup?

Silly me I thought I had to buy the Lyle's syrup from your shopping guide. I bought it at World Market and then found it at my local Kroger who knows how many other places carry it. Glad to know I am not the only one to find the dough too sticky. I ended up rolling the dough into a ball, placing it on the parchment paper, then I pressed down with a bottom heavy square low ball glass and then baked them on the same piece of parchment. Very easy, no waste, no extra clean up. The cookies baked perfectly round.

Crystallized ginger adds tiny sparks of ginger to this thin, deliciously chewy cookie. Got off to a slow start as the mixture wasn't solid enough to really form into a disk, so I helped it into a bowl and waited a day or so. Well worth the wait. A worthy companion to that other great Gourmet ginger cookie made with whipped cream. Hmmm! Maybe we'll ice them next year.
