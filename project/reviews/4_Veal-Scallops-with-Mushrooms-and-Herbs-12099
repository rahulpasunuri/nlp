This was pretty good -- in fact, I'd give it 3-1/2 forks if I could. It wasn't difficult to make, but I could see where it could get time consuming if the recipe was to be doubled or tripled. I would have liked a little more crust on the veal. Perhaps I need to have the heat higher? I cooked it on medium-high, as suggested by the recipe. I also wished there had been a bit more sauce. I served some buttered noodles on the side, and it would have been nice to have the sauce stretch to cover those as well. Overall, this was pretty good though.

Made this as a special anniversary dinner for boyfriend and me, and it was a hit! I used pork instead of veal because I'm broke, but the sauce is amazing. AMAZING. A little more intensive than I'm used to, but so worth it for something special!

Maybe I didn't make this recipe correctly but it really wasn't very impressive. Too much work for the mediocre results. Too many mushrooms, the shitakes were a waste - I recommend white button mushrooms only. This recipe really does take a long time to make. More than an hour. I suggest trying a veal piccata dish from Food Network instead. Faster, simpler, tastier.

Delicious. My husband loved it. I don't think I would say it is easy, since there is much slicing and dicing and cooking things separately. It needs attention and can't be just left to cook. I added a bit of butter to brown the veal as some others have said. I also replaced the cream with sour cream and it was very smooth and light. Will definitely make again.

Man, was this recipe good! I did not change a thing. I felt like I was eating at an upscale restaurant. My only issue was the overall time to prepare and cook the dish, as I tripled the recipe to feed my family of six. Thus, the prep work, liquid reductions, etc., increased the total time to about 90 minutes. However, it was well worth it. A definite keeper

I was looking for a simple, different veal recipe and saw this one. The mushroom sauce sounds like the Mushroom Paprika on this website so I am eager to try it tonight. The only thing I will do differently is to use finely grated pecorino-romano cheese (we do low carb). The tang of the cheese would probably compliment the heavy cream mellowness. I'll let you know how the cheese works out. P.S. Try the Mushroom Paprika!!

Easy and exceptionally good! My husband, who does not like mushrooms, raved about this dish. Had enough sauce to serve over angel hair pasta. My only change was adding some butter when cooking the veal so it browned.

Wow! You don't need to change a thing! We used the veal scallops but are going to try with chicken tonight.

Used regular onions, white button mushrooms only (1/2 pound), and chicken scallopini instead of veal. Wonderful flavors! Company worthy!

Made this last night and it was great! Took longer to prepare then I expected (about 1 1/2 hours) but this was well worth the time it took to prepare. I used chicken breast instead of veal and that worked fine. I plan to make this dish over and over.

I made this for valentines and it was a great hit. The cream curdled a tiny bit when I put it in but it still tasted great and was pretty easy to pull together for a novice. I served with egg noodles.

I was looking for an easy veal recipe and this one was great! Unfortunately, I couldn't get veal the day I was going to make this, so I substituted thin sliced pork tenderloin. Served it with the sauce, over egg noodles. Fantastic! This one gets a spot in my permanent recipe box!

I used Herbs de Provence instead of dried sage with excellent results. I had some leftover portobello mushrooms which I used in place of white mushrooms. A very easy dish suitable for company.

I used chicken and only white mushrooms tossed in the juice of half a lemon. I reduced the wine by about a half and omitted the broth. Also we use KETO crumbs instead of flour. I found more olive oil was needed. We doubled the meat to 1 pound and doubled cream, mushrooms, shallots, garlic but not the wine. Excellent and easy to make.

This is a very good dish. I did not have much sauce though in the end. Would double up on it next time as I enjoy more sauce. Husband thought it was great. Will definitely make it again. Veal was great but don't forget that you only cook it as long as the recipe says otherwise it will be tough. I had a mixture of different mushrooms which was very flavourful. I put the veal and mushroom sauce on a platter and then topped it with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Decadent! Great!

This was a fabulous recipe--even my demanding girlfriend, who isn't that keen on veal, loved it. Shitake mushrooms do make a big difference. Fresh herbs, too. This is one of the best recipes I've found on Epicurious.

I used fresh shiitake mushrooms, other than that i followed the recepe exactly. Delicious! Would not change anything! My husband, who's been to the best restaurants, said he never knew veal could taste so good!

I don't know what happened to my preparation but I didn't like this much at all. I used all white mushrooms but that certainly could not make that much difference. I thought is was on the bland side then I over-peppered it. Anyway a real disappoinment after all the great reviews.

I licked the plate when noone was looking. Deep rich flavor in the sauce. Like the other cook, I used green onions instead of shallots. I also substituted enoki mushrooms for the shiitake; yes, they are quite different, but they worked. Leftovers were tasty two days later, gently reheated in the microwave.

Delicious! Made this for Valentines's Day dinner. The perfect thing if you want something special but do not have all day to cook. Mushroom mixture can even be made several hours ahead and kept in the fridge, then reheated w/sauce at last minute. A keeper!

This was a very easy dish to prepare and very delicious. I didn't have shallot so I used green onions instead. Used 1/2 lb of white mushrooms instead of 1/4 lb of shiitake and 1/4 lb of white mushrooms only because I didn't have the shiitakes. Needless to say there were no left overs.

Excellent dish. Made it exactly as directed (but did add some butter to the browning oil) and it was great. Thick, creamy, sauce that coats your mouth with a mushroomy flavor, the tender veal is complimented like restaurant fare. A wild/white rice blend sopped up some of that extra sauce.

Great recipe! I made a few changes though...first of all, I omitted the heavy cream and substituted fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch and H2O. Also omitted the sage and added some capers. I served it with some pesto mashed potatoes.

This recipe is to die for!!I put the veal back into the pan with the sauce and kept it on very low heat until everyone was seated. Add fresh sage sprigs for a beautiful presentation!

I liked this dish, though I used fresh sage and would also recommend adding more than you think you need. The only problem I had was that when I added the cream at the end, the sauce curdled somewhat (affected the looks more than the taste). How do I fix this? I used regular (table?) cream - should I have used heavy whipping cream? If I could fix this, then I would give it three forks.

I prepared this recipe with garlic,buttermilk potatoes instead of pasta. Great! I found the sauce amount just great for the amount of veal. This is a keeper. Having guest on the weekend and will double the recipe.

Yuck, yuck, YUCK! Am I missing something? Did a calf actually have to die to make this recipe? Are the other reviewers tastbud challenged? It was awful! The sage and wine just did not mesh. Even my husband, who can find merit with the worst recipe, couldn't eat this. Beware!! You were warned!

We made this tonight for the second time - first time was MAGICAL, second time was just very good (not that that's bad, it just wasn't as AMAZING the second time.) I would add a smidge of butter to the oil when browning the veal - otherwise, it doesn't brown very well. Great flavors, used fresh sage instead of dried and that flavor really shot through. The shiitakes make a great topping, and guests were impressed.

The many layers of flavor in the sauce make this an exceptional dish! My husband loved it and asked that I add it to my "make it again" recipe collection. To make this dish less costly, I will try this using chicken breasts, and perhaps pork tenderloin as well. I encourage all to try this easy to make company pleasing dish!

This recipe was exceptionally good and I would definitely make it again. It would surely fit the bill for a celebration, for guests, or when you want to show off your cooking skills a bit (they don't have to know how simple it was). A tip though - the sauce is probably more than enough for four servings of veal as opposed to two.

Recipe calls for" all-purpose seasoned with salt and pepper for dredging the veal". I know what this means but my young married daughters will not. This is just an FYI

This was one of the first recipes I tried as a Gourmet subscriber, and it's now my favorite way to prepare veal medallions. As an added touch, I now usually add about a tablespoon of reconstituted dried porcini mushrooms along with the other mushrooms (I'm hooked on wild mushrooms). As far as pairing a wine with this dish, I've enjoyed it with a Rodney Strong Chalk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay as well as a Robert Mondavi Reserve (Unfiltered) Pinot Noir.

Great recipe! I used boneless chicken thighs instead of veal. Easy prep. to do ahead of time (mushrooms) and real quick to put together last minute.
