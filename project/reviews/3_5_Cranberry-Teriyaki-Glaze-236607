This was excellent. I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! It is a great dish for dinner parties because you just let it braise... Love the cranberry teriyaki glaze....

Made this a couple of years ago for Thanksgiving using the glaze on grilled sweet potato spears (as in the recipe on Ming Tsai's website/cooking show.) Loved it and will make it again this year.

This was awesome! I agree that the one bad review must have been because the person used not just the zest, but also the white pith... Pith is notoriously bitter. I used it with the asian ribs and also over some grilled pork chops- yum!!

This was divine! Too bad it has not been reviewed by more people. Jiilianpie's review scared me but I thought I would give it a try because the ingredients sounded so interesting. WOW, am I ever glad that I did! This glaze is the perfect accompaniment to the asian braised ribs. This will definitely be on the repeat list!!!!!!

On paper, this looks like a great recipe. The reality (for me) was these flavors combined disastrously. The orange peel ended up assuming a weird, bitter flavor upon being simmered with the onions and soy, and the final product was a gross amalgam of overly sweet mushy awfulness with an even worse aftertaste. I threw the mess away and dipped my pot stickers in soy sauce. Bummer.

Delicious! This was tasty, easy & festive enough for our Christmas dinner. I seasoned and seared a pork loin, then basted it towards the end of its cooking time with this glaze a couple times. My only regret is that I didn't serve the leftover glaze as a dipping sauce with the pork. This will be made every year!

This is simple to make and made our roast pork loin festive to serve for our Christmas Dinner. I also liked the fact that you can make it 2 weeks in advance! I seasoned and seared a pork loin, then towards the end of cooking, I basted with the glaze a couple of times. Wish I thought to serve the leftover glaze as a dipping sauce or even to pour over the sliced pieces. Will definitely make every Christmas season!
