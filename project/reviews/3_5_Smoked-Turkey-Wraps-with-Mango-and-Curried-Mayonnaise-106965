I love this sandwich. I've made it several times for family and guests. Each time everyone has raved on how yummy and different it is. The flavors go together perfectly!

Fresh and summery sandwich with an unusual taste profile--I certainly would never have slapped this together on the fly. The novelty was pleasing, and I didn't find the curry-mayo at all overpowering (very complementary), but at the same time it's not exactly what I'm looking for in a sandwich. It feels like a salad tucked inside a wrap. A nice one, though. I'll have it again sometime.

These were so great! I made them with tortillas, and followed the directions exactly. They were the perfect summer sandwich and were a big hit!

These wraps are delicious! The curry- mango-cilantro combination is perfect. If you plan on making substitutions for these key ingredients, you may as well find a different wrap recipe. The only change I would suggest is to cut back on the mayo if it is too much for your taste.

Very yummy sandwiches. Perfect for a picnic. (Didn't) and wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe has been a favorite of mine for years! I agree with previous reviewers regarding the mayonnaise; there definitely is too much. Also, I use a bamboo mat to roll up the wraps and then slice them, like sushi rolls. Yummy and fun!

To make this even easier, instead of toasting curry powder, I substitute Indian curry paste (Sharwood brand), since it already has toasted curry flavors. Really yummy; the mango makes the dish.

Probably more of a 2.5 forks. This was an interesting recipe, but nothing truly spectacular -- I used only HALF the amount of curry powder called for, and got plenty of flavor. In fact, my first test batch (with the full 2 tspn of curry) was too much for my tastes (even though I'm Asian and am very used to curry). Don't make the wraps too early -- they tend to get soggy with the mayo, the veggies and all. Good quick recipe and good for picnics generally speaking.

WAY to much curry. It completely overpowers the wrap. I will try again with 1/2 tsp of curry instead of the 2 tsp that is called for.

My boyfriend & I really liked these wraps. I used flour tortillas (9" or so size). For 4 wraps I divided the following evenly: 8 oz. smoked turkey from the deli which I diced, (although I bet any turkey, smoked or not, or even shredded chicken would taste great) 2 cups sliced romaine lettuce and 1 cup sliced cucumber, approx. 1 lg. tablespoon of mango chutney per wrap, 1 good half cup cilantro and half a good-sized avacado. I also threw in a few chopped cashews on top of the mix before I folded them. The smaller amounts are what fit into the smaller size tortillas instead of the lavosh. I thought the recipie made an awful lot of the curry mayo, even so I slopped it on each wrap and still had about a quarter left over. I used "light mayo" but thought it needed more salt. I served this with the "Avacado, Hearts of Palm, and Red Onion Salad with Coriander (Cilantro) salad recipe on this site and a package of Near East Couscous with pine nuts which I topped with about 2 TBL of small dice Roma tomatoes mixed with chopped fresh mint. My boyfriend insisted I not loose this combination of foods as he really liked it. He is somewhat picky but this meal really got to him with all it's wonderful, fresh, clean flavors. A winner!

Made these superb sandwiches as part of my contribution to a family picnic at the beach to celebrate Canada Day. Great complementary flavours, lovely blend of colours and textures, and much enjoyed by all including young children. Instead of lavash or tortillas, I used pita pockets spread with mango chutney and lined with romaine leaves. Also used cubed smoked chicken breasts rather than slices. Diced all the remaining ingredients, added the chicken and mixed with the curried mayo so it was like a chicken salad, then stuffed the pitas so they were fat and almost bursting at the seams. Individually wrapped in saran, they held/travelled very well. Also made the Curried Vegetable Dip (from this site but minus the celery/cucumber) and served with a tray of fresh veggies (the usual suspects) and fresh fruit - chunks of pineapple/cantaloupe/honeydew, wedges of pears/apples/peaches/papaya/apricots and was pleased with how well the curry flavour of the dip complemented the fruit. My dessert contribution was Strawberries in Lavender Syrup (we are at the height of local strawberry season and my lavender is in full bloom)and my daughter's dessert was Nectarine Cake Squares (both from this site) served with blackberry gelato procured at the last minute from a nearby beach-side shop. All in all, a super picnic with great Epicurious food!

Yum! I will definitely make these again. So easy and so tasty. The mango and curry mayo go together amazingly well. I used tortillas and eyeballed the amount of mayo and filling to use--there is no way I could've rolled these things up with as much in them as the recipe calls for!

This recipe is perfect exactly as is. My first impression of the recipe was, very interesting. But this turned out to be the best mix of flavors and the curried mayo tops it all off. I made these as part of a romantic brunch in the park. Love it!

My very picky family really enjoyed this one. I used half of the required curried mayonnaise, and it was perfect.

Yuck -- messy to put together, hard to roll up and keep it rolled. Got soggy fast. Tasted okay otherwise it would have been a 1. Never again!

I replaced the mayo mix with an old recipe I have for vegetable dip: 1 Cup mayo, 2 Ts (table spoon) grated onion, 1 ts (teaspoon) tarragon vinegar, 2 ts chopped chives, 2 ts chili sauce (or seafood cocktail sauce), ½ ts curry powder, ½ ts salt, ¼ ts pepper, 1/8 ts ground thyme. Make mayo fix a day ahread for the flavors to mix. I used all the fresh fruit and vegetables as stated in this recipe with tortilla for the wrap. Very colorful and tasty.

Contrary to everyone else who wrote in, I thought this was truly gross. I followed the recipe exactly (using the fresh mango, not mango chutney). I am not a picky eater at all, and I threw mine away and went out for dinner.

Excellent special sandwich! I added thinly-sliced pears too. I've got to learn how to fold these things right though; it was falling apart and getting a bit messy as I was eating it. I'll make it again; the combination of flavours was wonderful.

The original version of this recipe appeared in Bon Appetit July '89, when it was very difficult to find lavash and no one had heard of a wrap. It called for 8 ounces of cream cheese, 1/4 cu. mango chutney, 3/4 tsp curry powder. I've been serving it off and on ever since. I slice them and serve them on a platter for a cocktail party too.

I made this for a group of women who are discerning cooks. We all loved it. It is great for a warm weather dish. I am not a cilantro fan, so I omitted it. Wonderful, served with a tomato-basil salad with balsamic dressing.

the dish was wonderful and I would make it again for my friends. Bon Appétit. I love that dish @: )

Delicious...like previous cooks, I used mango chutney 'stead of fresh fruit. The leftover chutney from our neighborhood Indian restaurant was far superior to some bottled stuff we also had in the fridge...The curry mayo is very good, though we used a fat-free mayo. This is a healthy recipe that makes eating a big handful of veggies especially flavorful.

I made a couple of minor changes - used mango chutney instead of the mango and omitted the cilantro and avocado. This is a very easy and interesting recipie that I think would work really well as an appetizer if sliced in rounds. The lavash worked nicely but I thought it was a bit too "bready" for this - i'll use tortillas next time.

Wow! Can't beat this for a quick, delicious, unique meal. I left out the romaine lettuce because my husband isn't a fan of "leaves". ;-p I also used flour tortillas unstead of lavosh and made extra of the curried mayo. I think a mango chutney would add even more interest. Sweet, crunchy, smoky and different. Would be a great choice for a luncheon menu or picnic as well. More, more, more of these type recipes, please!

I am a vegetarian and left the turkey out of my sandwich. My husbnd loved the turkey version, and I loved mine as well. I have used tortillas and pita and both have worked well.

A very interesting mix of flavors! I did leave out the avocado since I am not a fan of it, and I used whole wheat tortillas. The curry flavor and the mango really made the sandwich unique. Try it!
