A surprisingly bad dish with so many good things in it. Cooking all of these vegetables at one time and keeping them separated before and after roasting is a huge pain in the butt without a tasty payoff. Each vegetable ends up underdone or overdone in their own special way. My beets took an hour to cook. One or a couple of these veggies roasted for a chicken salad would be nice. As it happened everything ends up looking and tasting like beets on the plate anyway, for four times the effort of beets alone.

I took this salad to a summer birthday party and the guests devoured it. I found that the vegetables can all roast at the same time with zucchini on the bottom rack. Next time on a hot night we may grill them instead. Using the BBQ chicken is a great time-saver.

I could not find small beets, but did have asparagus, so maybe I can't properly judge this recipe, but I thought it far too much work for the result. The vegetables aren't so much roasted as baked, and the dressing needs more punch. Maybe roast at a higher temp.

Very, very good. A little more work than I'd like but worth it. I used 2 large chicken breasts seasoned with salt,pepper and garlic.

I used yellow beets for this salad. Yellow beets have a milder taste than the red ones, and they don't leave stains on your cutting board or clothes. Next time I'll use both yellow and red beets (roasted separately).

I loved this recipe. Now I know what to do with leftover chicken. I didn't have white potatoes or zucchini so I used sweet potatoes and cabbage instead. I also improvised the dressing because I did not have lemon. A very adaptable, easy and delicious recipe.
