Actually I did not have rice vinegar, so I used champagne vinegar.

This was delicious. The only modification I made was that i marinaded the jicama overnight with a little fresh lime and clementine juice.

Very good! I added 1 scallion and 2 stalks celery, sliced very thin, to the salad. I had to substitute canned water chestnuts for the jicama because I made this at the last minute. Also, I used spicy paprika instead of regular paprika. If you do this, cut the amount!!!

This salad was pretty good. I found that the dressing lacked flavor and was missing something. I added extra cayenne pepper, and lots of salt and pepper. I used some of the dressing to marinate some shrimp which I grilled and added to the salad. This was a nice touch. I also substituted quinoa for the greens in order to make this salad a one dish dinner. I would make this again, but would use less oil, and more seasoning.

The dressing was wonderful! I used hot paprika to make a sweet hot compliment. I bet grilled or coconut shrimp would be great on this.

I think this could be really good. But at the farmers market I thought I was buying a spring lettuce3 mix and I got a peppery mix that was very distracting from the flavor of the mango. The dressing, cashews and jicama seemed to to go very well together.

If you're good at picking out a ripe mango, the extra sugar shouldn't be a problem. I used more cashews and crushed the majority. I sprinkled them on top of the salad and garnished with some whole cashews and mango. The dressing is a great compliment to the sweet, crunchy texture of ingredients and makes for a four-star presentation. Everyone raved!

This was just okay. The mango has to be ripened perfectly to get the right flavor for the dressing.

Very simple and delicious, I used green leaf lettuce and arrugula. One of my dinner guests suggested bottling the dressing and selling it!

I followed the other reviewers' advice by upping the sugar(about an extra 1/2 tsp.) which it definitely needed to balance the lime. I found the cayenne to be too overpowering & would add only 1/8 tsp. next time. Great w/the jicama!

Excellent salad - good combination of ingredients. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews!

I loved this salad. It's exactly what I've been looking for. I have to admit that I made some changes straight off based on other reviews and a taste test of the dressing. I added an extra tsp. of sugar to cut the tartness. Next time I think I'll add a total of 1-1/2 tsp of sugar so I dont' loose the zip of the lime. Also, I'll probably cut the oil a bit. All in all though I thought the combination of flavours, colours and textures was wonderful as did the guests at our Thanksgiving dinner last night!

Rating is based on a couple of changes - I reduced the lime juice to 2 tbsp to make it less tart, and cut the oil in half. I've made it twice now for picnics and barbecues and came home with none!

Good salad! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe and it came out a bit tart for my taste. The second time I substituted honey for the sugar and eliminated the cashews and now I absolutely love the salad! Pretty easy to make, too.

My husband and I love this salad and we've made it several times. It goes especially well with Indian food, or if you just want to spice up an otherwise ordinary meal. I think it's easy to prepare, though cutting up a mango is never fun. Still, it's an unusual salad that tastes great.

I found this salad to be unusually tart. It was also time consuming and frankly not worth the effort.

Delicious salad when mango's are in season, a definite make again.

A very lively, crunchy, sweet/tart salad -- you'll never go back to ranch-on-iceberg again. The dressing is such a pretty colour! I added half a chopped, seeded jalapeno to the blender.

This salad is absolutely delicious! So easy to prepare too. Very colorful with the mango and mixed greens.
