Excellent! I used achiote paste, disolved in orange and lime juice (added a bit of garlic and oregano). It turned out perfect. The pickled onions are essential (although they needed a bit of vinegar for the appropriate sourness).

This was good - I added a couple minced hot little chilis and some tequila, to mimic my puerco pibil recipe. Didn't bother with the leaves, just wrapped in foil. Good chicken dish, but it's better with pork.

Wow. The first words out of my husband's mouth after he took his first bite. I served this with Aromatic Yellow Rice (Bon Appetit 6/99). It was great. I did make a few changes when preparing the chicken: no achiote at Krogers, so I used SazonGoya, the only seasoning with Achoite I could find. I marinated the chicken overnight, and used indirect heat on the grill for an hour and 15 min. at 350º. A real keeper!

This was pretty good, but it needed some heat. Next time I will add a chili or some hot sauce.

This was wonderful, and so easy. A storm kept me from going out to buy the greens, so simply used aluminum foil. Definitely a keeper

I was skeptical over the great reviews of this recipe (and seeing the last one made me more so), but had the annatto seeds etc. lying around. Didn't use banana leaves (stuck on an island, no hispanic grocery stores), but had everything else. Nothing short of fantastic, based on overall flavor and extreme ease of preparation. Cooked in triple layer foil on the grill. First five minutes a side on high then slow cook for 40 min. on top rack (if you do not have a top rack cook on very low. Great flavor and even better, low in calories. That's what gave it the extra star. Yeah a pound of butter and cream makes everything taste better...

I am not sure what everyone else like so much about this recipe. The flavors were good, but not outstanding. The effort of removing the skin, which I personally really dislike doing, was not worth it for this dish. Maybe I missed something, but overall just not good enough to make again.

Wonderful light chicken recipe! Next time I will double sauce because it is great served over rice. Banana leaves, 2 layers of foil, and tossed on the BBQ (indirect heat) for an hour, produced fall-off the bone tender chicken! Try it - you won't be sorry.

This dish was a total hit with my guests. I did find the bananna leaves frozen at a Mexican grocery and I cooked the dish over indirect heat on the grill for 45 minutes.

One could also use banana leaves or just parchment, it seems that the collard leaves are there just to maintain moisture.

Delicious! Not too difficult to make. My husband said this is a keeper. I made four individual packets and froze the other two servings.

I didn't use the collard leaves, just baked the dish in a casserole. It was really tasty and a nice change when chicken dishes are getting boring.
