My sister made this as a starter for our Thanksgiving dinner. Very flavorful and not as heavy as you'd expect a chowder to be. Everyone loved it, even my husband, who is not a shellfish fan (he skipped the shellfish and ate the broth/potatoes). We didn't have the salt pork croutons, but the soup was delicious nonetheless.

This is a lovely chowder, very simple, traditional and elegant. Especially as with a meal that is going to be complex, and multi-facted, this simple chowder is a great start. If you don't care for the salt pork croutons, don't add them, or substitute some thick bacon cracklings, instead. Fresh herbs really make the difference, as well.

I've made this recipe 4 times, all to rave reviews. Really great as a Thanksgiving starter. It's absolutely delicious.

I thought this was terrible...it was by far the weakest part of the overall Thanksgiving menu and I've since replaced with Butternut Squash soup. The salt pork "croutons" were awful...didn't like anything about this recipe.

Originally, I made this recipe as a mid-day treat while watching football and preparing dinner on Thanksgiving Day. The recipe is easy and is great served in big mugs.
