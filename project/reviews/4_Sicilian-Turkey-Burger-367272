I tend to think turkey burgers are usually bland but these were wonderful and my husband loved them. Used fresh basil and raisins instead of currants. My hubby hates raisins so he wanted to dislike these when he saw me adding them but he couldn't taste them...delicious!

My husband declared this "one of the best burgers I've ever had...not just turkey burgers, ALL burgers." My market didn't have currants so I bought raisins and ran them with the capers and some fresh basil through the food processor before mixing with the turkey. The result was a moist and flavorful burger, with all the flavors perfectly blended in. This will become a staple menu item in our household!

We really enjoyed this, hearty and healthy. It went well with the Cucumber, Tomato and Feta Salad.

I didn't have currants on hand so I left them out, but aside from that I made these as written along with some oven baked fries. They looked very burnt despite following the cooking times, but in the end it turned out to be from the tomato paste--no burnt taste at all. Both my husband and I loved them!

This looks like an amazing recipe with a fresh take on the turkey burger! Have you ever tried steaming them? My recipe is plain by comparison, but the cooking method is original, I explain it here: http://imunchie.com/mamapeggy/munchies/turkey-burger-with-chips
