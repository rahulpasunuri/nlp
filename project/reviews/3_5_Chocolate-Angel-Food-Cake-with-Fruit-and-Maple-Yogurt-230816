This was great! I didn't think I liked angelfood cake until I found this recipe. The flavor was mild, and the texture was great: fluffy but moist. I brought this to brunch and served it with strawberries/mangos, along with plain yogurt, vanilla, and honey whipped into cream (which was delicious, tangy like cream cheese). I made this because I had a ton of egg whites leftover from making creme crulee, and now I will be making this every time I have leftover egg whites!

I've made this several times and it is easy and delicious. I omit the juice from the yogurt topping and don't miss it. The cake doesn't keep well, however. So better make it for a big group or eat it fast.

Excellent! I just made the cake and skipped the other parts of the dessert. I just served with some fresh sliced strawberries. I used the carton of egg whites to save time and found this to be quite quick and easy.

This was terrific. Served it with decadent Whipped Cream and home canned "Rummed" Peaches. Was a hit with us and our guests. Will definitely make again!

WOnderful and fun desert. It is great that yogurt is used instead of ice cream.

This version of chocolate angel food cake came out excellent! I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream-- easy, light, and delicious. Will definitely make again.
