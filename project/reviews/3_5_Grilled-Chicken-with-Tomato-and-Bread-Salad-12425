I only made the Salad, no chicken. It was really really good, even better the next day. The earlier you make it the better.

I use asiago cheese bagels .... cut into chunks and toasted. Also add mozzarella

It could have something to do with having a 4 month old and just coming out of casserole heaven. However, I thought this was fantastic! Tons of flavor and not too much work. It definitely spiced up my Tuesday night :) Yummy.

Exellent summer supper. Used a store-bought roasted chicken to make things quick and added chunks of fresh mozzarella. Delicious!

This recipe is delicious! Great during the hot summer days, and perfect for cookouts. We omit the celery, and use half of the olives. Serve with corn on the cob and glasses of pinot grigio. YUM!

I have made this several times without the chicken as a side dish at BBQs. It's always a hit!

Wonderfully fresh; make the GREAT salad with other meals too. I use kalamati olives, but buy them PITTED to make prep easier. My children aren't usually salad eaters but they LOVE this salad.

I loved this. I used fresh ciabatta (toasted as per the recipe), an extra tomato, half the olive oil and everything else the same. It was especially good the next day when the bread had really absorbed all the flavors. I think the ciabatta has the tooth that prevents it from dissolving into a gummy clump. Big, fresh juicy tomatoes are a must!

This is a great dish! Especially for all you garlic lovers. I do add a bit more celery and I used a pre-made roasted chicken to make things a bit easier.

I made this dish vegetarian using seitan in place of the chicken. The seitan is fat-free, which makes this a little healthier. I also used 1/2 the oil suggested. I sauteed the seitan in garlic and added feta as suggested by other reviews. My husband hasn't complained yet, but we're eating this at least once a week at this point!

We make this dish often because it has great content for diabetics. I sometimes blanch & chill fresh green beans for additional flavor and color. It will definitely be a summer mainstay and a good winter change-of-pace, when we can get decent tomatoes in the off-season.

SO delicious and perfect for summer. I added about 3/4 cup of small, cubed extra sharp provolone, and garnished each plate with the fresh basil, instead of mixing it in (to keep the color more vibrant). I also marinated the chicken for about an hour, as recommended by other reviewers, in white wine, olive oil, lemon juice, crushed red pepper and dried basil. Perfect!

What did I miss? It was okay but nothing very special. Then again, it's just as well we all have different tastes ... How boring it would be for everyone to like the same things in the same degree!

Loved this recipe. I used balsamic vinegar and heirloom tomatoes. Fantastic!! Summers bounty at its best.

Easy recipe however definitely marinate the chicken with fresh basil, olive oil and garlic. Also I added crumbled Feta cheese and served the salad on a bed of lettuce - it was delicious. Great to take to BBQ's!

excellent and simple version of a bread salad. everytime I serve this to guests I am asked for the recipe. My family also loves it. I love it because it's so easy to prepare and makes a lovely presentation, besides tasting so good.

Excellent! As other reviewers have said, double the dressing (probably not the garlic),and marinate the chicken before grilling. Yum!

Definately double dressing. I also seeded the tomatoes and mixed them together with the onions, capers and olives and let them sit so that the tomato juice became part of the moisture for the bread cubes. Very good. Topped with locatelli

Great hot weather dish; tastes like summer!

This wasn't bad, but I agree, you need to double the dressing (which I didn't, unfortunately). I took another reviewer's advice and marinated the chicken for an hour in the olive oil/white wine marinade and it was delicious! Next time, I'll add more olives, capers and onion, and less bread, then I think it will be much better.

Quick and easy. Just the thing after a long day at work.

This is a great recipe but I always tweak them a bit to guarentee they come out as good as I know they can be. First of all, I doubled the amount of dressing and really added a lot of garlic (some may not want to because raw garlic has a bite), and marinated the chicken for an hour in a half cup each of olive oil, white wine, a TBLS of parsely, a 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper, 1 tsp. of dried minced garlic and 1 tsp of salt. It's a great recipe for a night when you want something that tastes hearty but really is quite light.

A very pleasant and light salad for a summer meal.I would definitely make it again.

Overall, this was an easy and tasty meal. A few suggestions: use one golden tomato for additional color, increase the amount of dressing, marinate the chicken before grilling (I used lemon, garlic and olive oil).

This was OK, somehow I expected it to be better. I think I will try more dressing and more garlic next time.

I will definitely make this again. This dish was delicious. I have heard about bread salads but have never made one. I sure am glad I made this one. My husband even had second helpings and he is a true 'meat & potatoes' guy!

I loved this recipe! The bread and tomatoe salad is so delicious that it could be eaten by itself or as a side to almost any meal. Very visually appealing.
