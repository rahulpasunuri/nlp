These are very good and very rich. We ended up adding more cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger - about 1 1/2 of what it called for in the recipe. Cooked the cookies for 11 minutes and they came out perfect every single time (made enough for 6 dozen whoopie pies). Used a pastry bag to put them on the cookie sheets. It was easier than the small ice cream scoop and also made a pretty design. Ended up with 30 cookies for each batch. Appreciated the person who said they kept well. It allowed me to make them a day ahead of the party without worrying. I also kept mine in the fridge and they turned out great as well.

And as others only used one tbs of batter per cookie, who want's to eat a huge dessert?

I don't usually cook desserts but then things we do for a neiborhood dessert x-mas party... These were great, I only used about cup of sugar in the filling and added vanilla liquor instead of bourbon, great result - favorite at the party.

These were delicious. I made according to recipe- but used only 1 T of batter for each cookie. I assembled them right before I was serving them on Thanksgiving. However, I had some leftovers in the fridge that have kept great- I am still eating them & I made them 5 days ago. They taste the same as the ones that were eaten right away. Next time I will make & assemble them ahead of time.

These were not only easy but a huge hit; my husband - who usually does not like pumpkin desserts - literally raved! The cakes did not spread or flatten at all while baking, so for the first batch I just patted them down a bit before they were finished cooking. For the second batch I flattened them slightly before they went in the oven. They are supposed to be cakey - don't overcook. The suggested small cookie dough scoop was a HUGE help in dealing with the sticky dough and getting the cakes perfectly round and evenly-sized, which is important since you're sandwiching them together. They were relatively small which I thought was the perfect size. The nuts were a tasty addition, though I did half of them with and half without as I knew some would prefer them plain. Be sure to chop the nuts up finely so they adhere and for a nicer presentation - mine were a bit too chunky. I had no trouble with the filling being too soft, but I did chill them again after assembling.

These are fantastic! I made a few modifications. Since I also made Pecan Diamonds for our Thankgsgiving dessert buffet, I used candied hazelnut bits instead. I wanted them bite-sized, so I only used about 3/4 tablespoons of batter per cookie. The batter was sticky and difficult to distribute evenly, so I put it in a ziplock, cut the corner, and piped it onto the cookie sheets that way. And of course I doubled the Bourbon!

These are very easy to make. They had the taste of pumpkin pie but the fun of cupcakes. Loved the filling. It was very light and fluffy. Since these are not cookies, the sponginess, as noted by another reviewer, is in keeping with this type of sweet (cake). Family really liked this recipe.

This recipe had good flavor, however, I did not like the sponginess of the cookie. This recipe goes in the bin.

Amazing. Brought these to a Halloween party and everyone loved. The addition of the candied pecans gives a nice crunch. Will be making again for Thanksgiving. Delicious and easy.

These were very simple to make, but came out delicious and are a bit more special than a plain cookie, I think. Also recommend subbing the bourbon in the filling!

I just got done making these! Well the cake/cookie part at least. I'm not using the nuts and I used a different filling recipe, but the cake/cookie part came out perfect! I just bought a wilton pumpkin & leaves shaped whoopie pie pan, and it DID cook exactly 16 sandwich cookie just as this recipe states!

These are so good! I tried them with and without the pecans - definitely better with the crunch from the pecans. Flavors were wonderful. The cakes were very light and tender. Definitely a keeper!

Very delicious! A super easy and a quick recipe to make! I had a couple of parties to attend this weekend and whipped up a double batch. Rave reviews all around. I needed to make something that could sit out at room temp for a bit and still hold up. Instead of using the recipe for cream cheese filling I made an Italian buttercream and flavored it with some of my dad's homemade maple syrup. Perfection on a fall day!

this was the most awesome whoopie pie recipe ever. i also left out the pecans. delicous and sweet. I definately will be making these again and soon.

These were great! I skipped the candied pecans and though I can't be sure was pretty glad I did-- these were rich enough as is. I thought "scant two tablespoons" was waaaay too big for these-- I did about a tablespoon for most of these and they were just right. If you wanted people to just have one, maybe two tablespoons would be OK. In fact even with the one-tablespoon size, I ended up cutting each pie in half so they would be more "party size" for munching. Will definitely make again.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were delicious! Definitely line your baking sheet with parchment paper, and watch the cookies/cakes the last 2 or 3 minutes of cooking time...the cookies will be shiny, but the edges will be dry and that's when you want to take them out of the oven...any less time and your cookies will be raw...any more time and they will be overdone. I already have requests to do these again next year!
