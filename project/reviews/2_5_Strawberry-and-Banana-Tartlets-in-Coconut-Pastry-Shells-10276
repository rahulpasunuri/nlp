This recipe needs revisions - I followed the recipe exactly and the filling was so thick I could hardly stir it. I added more milk to adjust the consistency, and the flavors were still fine. Then I used 1/2 cup of whipping cream because there didn't seem to be nearly enough filling. Even with those changes the crusts were not full enough. I like the flavors and the basic idea, but it needs work.

Very good! I prefer to bake the shells the same day they are to served. So, it is nice and crisp.
