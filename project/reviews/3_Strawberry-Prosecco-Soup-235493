haven't tried it, but happen to have the ingredient list (from the magazine itself): 1 lb strawberries chopped, 1 cup Prosecco, 2 tsp chopped fresh tarragon, 1/8 tsp salt, 2 to 3 Tbs sugar, 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt, garnish: cracked black pepper. Looks yummy, and I can't wait for the summer to try it with some very fresh berries.

the reviewers here wonder about pepper: Pepper (freshly ground) is a perfect addition to plain fresh strawberries--it enhances sweetness and draws out flavor without the powdered sugar. It works similarly in this recipe.

I made this recipe back when it had proportions for the ingredients, and it was tasty. I've tried to reconstruct it using similar recipes I've found, and the proportions seem to be about thus: 4-5 c strawberries, washed and hulled 1 c prosecco, give or take 2T sugar Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1-2 Tbs tarragon (although I prefer chopped mint!) Put that all in a blender until it's soupy. I like to add a dollop of creme fraiche to each bowl, but you could also put in 1-2 cups of your chosen creamy substance (creme fraiche, yogurt, whipping cream or half and half) during the blender phase. Either way, it's hard to go really wrong!

Sounds yummy, but there are no measurements? How many strawberries? How much tarragon? And what pepper? I think the majority of this recipe has been removed for some reason.

This is a perfect summer dessert to finish a dinner of grilled salmon (or other fish), grilled peaches and side vegetables and/or grain. I increased the tarragon to a little more than a tablespoon and used a high quality vanilla bean yogurt (Tillamook) that rounded out the flavor. The pepper seemed odd when reading the recipe, but it is a wonderful addition. Highly recommended.
