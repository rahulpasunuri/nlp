This is a fine easy base recipe, but the flavoring is way under-spiced. 1 garlic clove for 2# of meat? Really? Anyhow, the recipe is salvageable. I'd put some sort of rub into the ground meat - whether you're using beef or lamb. Perhaps a mixture of black pepper, salt, fenugreek, corriander and fennel seed. I didn't have tomato puree when I tried the recipe so instead I added a couple of Tb of tomato paste to the onion/garlic mixture (x4 garlic). Also, I added a Tb of the aforemnentioned rub to the onions as well. Then I added the meat to the onion/tomato-paste mixture and mixed before adding some tomato sauce. I also didn't use half&half - sour cream instead. I also didn't use chedder, I used some grated parmesan.

If I made this recipe again, I'd use only one onion and leave out the can of tomato puree. They made the dish too sweet for my taste.

This is a great and easy recipe to experiment with. One pound of ground beef seemed like enough. I also omitted the cayenne, added ~1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, and used 1/2 C frozen corn and 1/2 C frozen peas instead of just peas. For seasoning I used Montreal steak seasoning. We all loved it, even my picky and teething one-year-old. I liked that it was easy to prepare, even with a toddler running around. We'll be making this again.

It was "good." But it needs more cheese, and more seasoning. Also, 2 pounds of meat seemed a little much compared to the rest of it. 1 pound was plenty.

If Tanya's grandmother was English, then she should know this is COTTAGE pie NOT SHEPERD'S pie. It's only Sheperd's Pie if it's made with ground lamb.

This is a good starter recipe for Shepherd's Pie. Next time I will cube the potatoes for cooking, as the potato topping tasted pretty watery to me. I also used half ground turkey and real cheddar cheese. To add to the veggie content for my picky toddler, I pureed 1 1/2 cups microwaved carrots with the cooked peas and added the puree to the meat with the tomato sauce. It turned out nice and thick. I also had to turn on the broiler at the end to get any browning to happen. Partner loved it, toddler wouldn't let it in her mouth. I'm sure if she had tried it she would have loved it!
