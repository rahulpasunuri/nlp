This is the best hummus I've ever made. Great flavor due to toasted cumin and not too heavy on garlic.

I received as a gift a jar of smoked caviar. I wasn't thrilled with it - it tastes more like a smoked fish than ossetra (in fact, it tastes nothing like ossetra). I was searching desperately for a recipe to use the smoked stuff, and I came accross this one. Actually, I used my favorite mediteranian crisp bread, and my favorite deli bought humus. The result was astonishing! Not only made it the smoked caviar edible, the combination turned out to be delicious beyond belief. I strongly recomend that if you can't find smoked caviar, use thinly sliced smoked fish rather than caviar. The later is just way too different (and personally, I like to eat it with a spoon.)

These hors d'oeuvres were delicious! Even people that did not like caviar liked this appetizer. However, I could not find smoked caviar, so just use a high quality caviar.
