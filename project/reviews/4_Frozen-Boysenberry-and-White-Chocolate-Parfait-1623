Excellent. Light, refreshing and not overly sweet. With a little organization, not very difficult to make nor as messy as some people implied.

Oh my gosh is this GOOD! My guests were licking their plates, no exageration. It is rich, creamy, not too sweet, and simply beautiful. My guests actually accused me of "going out and buying an expensive dessert." I will definitely be making this show-stopper again!

NOT that impressed. It wasn't awful, but it lacked the richness that white chocolate should bring (I would have been no worse off using a good vanilla ice cream for the white chocolate part). My guests politely complimented me on this dessert, but for the amount of time, effort, and dirty appliances involved, it just wasn't worth it when there are much simpler desserts that yield much better results.

After reading the other reviews which complained about the prep time, I almost didn't make this (my 9-month-old takes up most of my time). But this recipe can be broken into three steps. For example, during the baby's morning nap I prepared the berry puree and the sauce. That chilled in the refrigerator during lunch. And during the afternoon nap I made the chocolate mixture and assembled the whole thing. Very do-able and so delicious!

Really wonderful, but way too time consuming, and I used every dish in my house in the preparation. Not sure I would go through that again, though it was very good.

I made this for Mother's Day dinner, it was really good and worth all the prep to make it. I used frozen rasberries to make the sauce and frozen blackberries to put in the parfait. I think I used every bowl in my kitchen and made a huge mess, I had berry sauce everywhere! We fought over the leftovers for the next few days.

This is a fabulous recipe! I took it to a meeting and really wowed the members. I did use the boysenberries. The only change I made was to reduce the sauce for the topping by cooking the juice & sugar before adding the creme de cassis. I bought a 4 oz. bar of white chocolate & would use all of it next time.

I, too have been making this recipe since it first came out, and with the substitution of rasberries. It can be made several days ahead which makes preparing your dinner less stressful. It is very elegant and beautiful and better than yummy!!!

I've been making this dessert since it appeared in 1991. It's a stunner and everyone who tastes it can't believe how good it is. I substitute raspberries for the boysenberries and it works out fine. The preparation is a bit tricky, particularly with the plastic wrap, but a little patience and you get the hang of it. Truly a gourmet dessert, and loved by even non dessert eaters.

I made this for Mothers Day brunch. Everyone was impressed and loved it. There was a race for the leftovers! Finding frozen boysenberries in Calgary is an impossiblity. I ended up buying the berry melody and picking out the blackberries, next time it all goes in. It is a bit fussy to make and the timing needs to be worked out better ie. prepare the pan somewhere in the middle while your waiting for things to cool. A little more liquor in the sauce never hurt anyone - I used Chambard. This is definitly a keeper!
