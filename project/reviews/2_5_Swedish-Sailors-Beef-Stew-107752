This recipe is in the book "Real Stew". I tried making this just to see if a stew this easy and simple could be any good. Very pleasantly surprised. You get a sweet, rich gravy and very tender meat. Will make again.

Since this is a sailor stew, I don't think a sailor is going to take a bunch of pretentious foodie spices and foods to make a "gourmet" stew. Space is limited on a boat so things have 2 be down to basics. Sometime simple is better. remember the term KISS?

I give this stew (without doctoring it up) just two forks. I added garlic and 1/4 cup of chopped(fresh) rosemary, along with 1 cup of beef broth. The rosemary was a lovely touch, but there are much better stew recipes out there...

So, this is a basic stew. I replaced half the onions with 2" chucks of carrot and added 1 1/2" tsp of both ground cardamom and thyme. I used an almost pale ale and added some beef broth. The beef was organic Black Angus that we raised. It was superb!!!

Surely anyone could have come up with this? Boring beyond belief.

This is great! My husband and I both love it. I made it as is with some carrots. It's so easy and came out perfect. The meat was very tender. I used heineken lager. I think the key is to use a good beer.

Came out wonderful... Used the recipe as a guide line and added some of the things i like in stew : Carrots, italian seasoning, a can of diced tomatoes with mushrooms, cinnamon and clove...the meat came out tender and delicious

This was awful. Someone said it tasted like a sailor. Not even close. This tasted worse.

I agree with "A Cook on 05/15/03", a flop. You stumbled this time Irene

Sorry to disagree with everyone, but I really thought this was a flop! Made as written, except threw in a few carrots, as suggested. Despite extra cooking time, the meat still seemed tough (like it had been cooked at too high a temp?), and none of us cared for the flavors (not to mention the beery odor that permeated the entire house during cooking). There are far better stews out there, even if I just throw the stuff in the crockpot in the morning!

I really liked this. Don't expect a knock-your-socks-off stew; it's just a simple, hearty dinner.

This stuff is great! So easy and tasty. I put all ingredients in the oven on a timer before I went to work, and came home to a fabulous meal. I'll try adding carrots and using a little less butter next time. It's a keeper.
