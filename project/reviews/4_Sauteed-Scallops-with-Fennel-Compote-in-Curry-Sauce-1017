This is the best dish I have ever prepared. My husband thinks it is the best dish he has ever eaten. The only substitutions are that I used homemade fish broth for the chicken stock (fennel) and clam juice (sauce) that I had left over from a recipe I made the day before. Also, I dredged the scallops lightly in some of the curry powder (took that hint from a Mark Bittman curry scallop recipe on this site). Here is a hint to make perfect medium rare scallops. First, use only dry pack scallops. Heat a large saute pan over medium-mod heat, place the lightly dredged scallop in pan for 2 minutes. Turn and immediately take pan off heat and cover. Remove in about 2 minutes (you may want to test one to make sure of level of doneness for you). Don't salt the scallops until after they are cooked; if you salt during the cooking process, they will begin to give off liquid and you can't get a good sear. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

Elegant and simple. Didn't have vermouth and substituted with Grand Marnier and sauce was still sublime. Very quick to come together. I made the fennel with olive oil instead of butter, next time will do a combo of oil and butter for better depth of flavor.

The only place I've been able to find clam juice in the UK is at Waitrose. I haven't made this recipe yet but sounds delish!

This is a go-to recipe for me when I'm looking for something fancy that can be mostly taken care of ahead of time. It's a rich, elegant and addictive dish. Be warned that the clam stock reduction yields a rather salty sauce, so you needn't season the scallops much. I also think the compote is most successful when the bits of fennel are microscopic, so I chop the fennel in a food processor (chopping fennel by hand is hard, anyway). I use an icecream scoop to mold the compote and finish the dish with minced chive.

Thus the reputation of Le-Bec-Fin. I made is as dinner for two. I intend to make it again as an appetizer for guests.

Sublime. Couldn't find clam juice in UK so substituted couple Tbsp Thai fish sauce (nam pla) also didn't have fennel bulbs so used leeks - delicious.

FANTASTIC!!! Made this for a very discerning eater who goes to NYC finest restaurants on a regular basis. He loved it as did the rest of the table. The fennel is a nice contrast.

This dish was delicious, but I did have one major substitution. As I was letting the sauce simmer for 20 minutes, I started cleaning the house. At 20 minutes, the sauce was dark, black tar at the bottom of the sauce pan. I did not have any more clam juice, so I used the left over chicken stock from the fennel compote. The sauce was delicious (and I can't wait to try it with the clam juide!) Hope this helps anyone else who may make the same mistake.

This dish, although it seems like it's too runny and won't have much flavour [at least that was my take] was fabulous! My guests loved it [so did my boyfriend and I]. They left hooked on fennel. The only suggestion I'd make is to be certain to slice the fennel really thin [mine were quite thick and took forever to cook]. Oh, and, I only used 2 fennel bulbs for this recipe which, I thought, was plenty. If you're looking for something that doesn't overwhelm the taste of great scallops, but is still creamy and tasty, this is it.

There is a terrific marriage of flavors to this dish. It did not take me too long to prepare. I let the sauce reduce slightly longer than the recipe called for and perched the scallops atop a thick dollop of sauce. Finished it with several drops of chive oil, which gave the plates a real professional look. Will be making it again soon.

This recipe is soooo good that the Gourmet Girls of Northern Virginia have decided to add it to their "Best of Gourmet Club" menu. I've served it twice now and can't wait to taste it again.

Made this as an appetizer for a New Year's Eve dinner and it was a hit. People had seconds. Le Bec Fin is nearby so if this dish is typical, I know it deserves the high rating it gets. Anyone know of anymore of Le Bec Fin's recipes? Let me know.

A friend of mine made this as a first coarse at dinner the other night. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. What a perfect combination of flavors. Now that I have the receipe I will be making it for my next gathering.

This is absolutely awesome! I'm going to make this again.

Ok, I must've been on crack or something because I actually used leek instead of fennel and didn't notice until the very end. I served it anyway and the end result was spectacular!!! My husband and I loved it. The mixture of flavors was superb - we'll definately make it again (maybe even try fennel next time) :)

Not sure why some people were not impressed with the curry sauce in this recipe. We made the entire dish exactly as the recipe states (we halfed it though)and we both thought it was fantastic. Like eating at Le Bec Fin without having to drive all the way to Philly! I served it with multi-colored orzo with cheese and garlic.

Excellent recipe!! I served this as part of a prelude to a trip to France. I used it as part of a buffet.

This is a fantastic recipe, assuming that the sea scallops are fresh and perfectly done. I actually toss some sesame seeds on the top and the bottom of the scallops before sauteeing to give the dish some more texture. The fennel compote tosses in some completely unanticipated flavors and the main ingredient comes as a surprise even to Italians who are used to eating shaved fennel in salads. I agree with the elimination of the curry sauce. I find that it detracts from the dish. I've eaten at the spectacular Le Bec Fin and hate to criticize anything they do, but sometimes less is more.

The compote is what makes this dish. I didn't have enough fennel so I added a sliced leek instead. Then, I think I added a bit too much chicken stock (I hardly ever measure) so it took over an hour to boil down. But was it ever fabulous. As for the curry sauce, it was too much effort and weird preparation for the results. I would repeat the compote though and would serve it with pork tenderloin or chops. The compote could be prepared in larger batches and frozen I bet.

I served the dish as a main course and it got rave reviews. I am orginally from Phila. and would love to go to LE-Bec-Fin if that is the try of food they present. The dish itself is easy since you can prepare just about everything in advance. I even did the sauce up to the part of adding the butter.
