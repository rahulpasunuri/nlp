this was great- my friend made this for dessert after dinner in the south of France and we served it with fresh strawberries- really tasty and unusual. he strained the peppercorns like another reviewer suggested.

I think this sounds unique and tasty. I haven't tried it yet, but am thinking about it. If I do make it, expect another review!

Unique and delicious! I left the crushed pieces of pink peppercorn in the mix instead of straining them out, and this was a mistake - tasters didn't like chewing on the bits. I recommend grinding some fresh pink peppercorns on top when serving instead, and straining as the recipe directs.

Great recipe! Flavor is very mild and I think I will add more peppercorns next time. The chocolate tart was esp yummy with it.

If you like pink peppercorns you will love this. We did not get a chance to eat this with the chocolate tart, it stands alone very well (only lasting through one Daily Show). Cheers!
