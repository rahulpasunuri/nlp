Oh how I love anything corn-meal based. Like Tamales, they are involving to make, but so worth it to me, and worth making a large batch. I would certainly recommend moistening the filling as you see fit, and deep frying is certainly how they ought to be cooked, but baking is healthier, and less mess. One way I like to keep the filling from getting too dry is to increase the oil, and then cover and simmer after adding the lime juice, instead of boiling off nearly all the moisture. Mmmm chipotles...

I made the filling according to the recipe except I halved the amount of raisins and gave them a rough chop before adding them. The filling is delicious and I will definitely make it again. I did not use the recipe for the dough as I did not have Masa in the house. I made a butter pastry dough, a reliable recipe from epicurious, and it worked really well with the filling. However, the next time I make this I will try it with the Masa dough.

Great recipe. My only suggestion is to make sure than you roll the dough very thin. I don't think I rolled it thin enough and they tasted a little more "bready" than I would have liked. I'll definitely make them again though.

Delicious flavors, but I agree with the other reviews - the filling turned out way too dry. The dough was fabulous though - interesting flavor and very easy to work with.

This recipe satisfied the tummies of my last dinner party. I must rave about the ease of handling the dough. It was a dream to work with.

Very good. I made the mistake of trying this with puff pastry once. Don't go there, make the dough.

Wonderful, authentic recipe! Definately make your own dough...it's fairly easy and worth it! I love that these are baked too! I used ground pork for the filing and added poblano pepper to the mixture. Can really use any type of meat for the filling. Will certainly make this again!!

It was great! I maded this dish for my family and they loved it. My mother has been making empanadas her whole life and she loved how easy the dough was to work with and how great it tasted. I'll make this dish again. Yum!

I only used the dough part of the recipe -- decided to gamble and used non-trans fat butter substitute instead of butter, and I think it came out great. Crust was very crisp. I had leftover dough, so stuffed it with apples, nuts, and raisins -- very good.

Loved this recipe, particularly the dough. It makes the empanadas and is definitely worth the effort. Please no pie dough. I did deep fry them. Thought the flavor was better than baking.

This recipe needs onion and a lot of garlic. The cook from El Dorado Hills had no business rating this recipe when she didn't follow it at all! Masa harina dough doesn't taste anything like her store-brand chilled pie crusts and pork and chicken bear no relation to each other. It's extremely annoying to see these people change the main ingredients of a recipe and then criticize it. Emapanadas made with pie crust? Go back to pillbury.com, where you can make haute cuisine from canned biscuits.

I thought these were very good but the next time I make them I am going to deep fry them like I do with other empanadas. It makes for a moister (and more fattening) dough.

These were really tasty and a great match with the chipotle salsa. The filling is sweet and savory all at the same time. The sweetness is nicely set off by the tangy salsa. This is my second-favorite empanada recipe (my all-time favorite is more savory...it's just a personal taste preference), but my guests who had never tasted my favorite recipe loved them.

Absolutely wonderful! My husband, who is my biggest fan and harshest critic, snarfed these up like they were going to be made illegal. I used a pound of ground pork as that's what I had on hand, added some minced onion (about 1/4 cup, since I can't have picadillo without it), some onion powder, left out the almonds, the buttermilk and replaced the jalapeno (I'm allergic) with cayenne and doubled the spices. I also was concerned that the filling would be too dry, so added 1/2 can beef broth to simmer and make everything come together. The dough was much easier to make and work with than I anticipated, although I only got 18 empanadas rather than the 24 this recipe is supposed to make. Served with hot chipotle plum sauce for dipping and spiced fried plantains - YUM! Can't wait to make this for a dinner party, although I think I'll either double or triple the recipe. Do these freeze well after baking, does anyone know?

I served these at a recent party and had more leftover than were eaten. I made them with chicken instead of pork so don't know if that's what made them mediocre. I also used frozen pie crust (which is typically reliable) so found them very time consuming to roll out, cut, brush with egg, fill and crimp. Not worth it after the unenthused response from my guests.

This was a tuff one to make the dough was kinda hard to work with since it was almost like there was not enuf liquid to add and i think you have to be careful with the liquid and im not a very good cook anyway you no? But it turned out pretty good and the tayste was da bomb, really awesome and I like spicey foods alot! If i becom a better cook mebbe i might trai this one again because its good.

The one thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of liquid left over in the meat mixture. I recommend that it stay a bit saucy, so that the empanadas don't turn out too dry. Will try this next time, as I loved the bold flavors of these empanadas, but wasn't too fond of the texture.

We really enjoyed these empanadas. I was amazed at the ease of handling the dough and had actually thought of using prepared pie crusts before trying it. I didn't make my own salsa, but definitely will next time.

Good recipe - I left out the Almonds and "heated up" the Chipotle Salsa. Prep time was more than I figured. Acutally took about 45 minutes of prep. Probably could've trimmed time by using canned tomatoes for Salsa.

these are so good and easy too. I've made them many times.

Dinner parties are made for this kind-of dish. EVeryone loves 'em. I served with a sweet-and-sour salsa and substituted green chili for the jalapeno, as I love the New Mexico touch.

This is a very delicious recipe and brings back memories of when I ate empananadas in the Mediterranean in the early 1960's.
