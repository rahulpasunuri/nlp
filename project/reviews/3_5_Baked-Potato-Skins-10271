a real comfort food. I'd allowed the skins to soak overnight with onions and garlic. Salt and peppered them with some Bay Seasoning and peparika and it came out scrunchliously delious! As for the previous review, what were you thinking when you decided to put them in a microwave?

This recipe is really easy and there is so much you can experiment with. I was short on time so instead of baking them for an hour first I simply microwaved them for ten minutes instead and it worked just fine. Try them with different sorts of dips and different spices, they are a really fun finger food!

These tasted excellent! I substitued cayenne pepper for the paprika to add a little kick and sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray instead of brushing them with oil to lower the fat content. I will make these often and plan to make mashed potatoes out of the pulp.

This wasn't worth the time to make. I really don't see why it got such great reviews. Don't recommend and won't make again.

Delish! Don't be shy on the salt; light sour cream doctored w/chives and cayenne pepper was perfect (kids liked ketchup). Had a few leftover baked, scooped out shells that I refrigerated & then brushed w/oil & baked the next day and turned out just as good. I wonder if microwaved potatoes would work as well? I'll try next time (would save time & energy). Not too oily; 1/4" shell thickness worked well.

This is a great recipe. I mixed sliced green onions and some cayenne pepper in the sour cream and it was delicious! Will definitely make again.

This was a huge hit at the superbowl party! Instead of sprinkling paprika I added chili powder to the oil and then brushed the skins. I also had no sourcream so I sofened some cream cheese added the new Helmanns tomato and bacon mayo and added chopped scallions to it. surprisingly it turned out pretty good.

A HUGE hit at the dinner party. Tasted excellent with sour cream. Very tasty and easy to prepare. An awesome taste as well. They were gone in about 10 minutes and people were ranting and raving over the taste. GREAT RECIPE i will definitly make these again soon.

This was tasty and very suitable for serving to folks watching football on TV -- easy and clean to eat with fingers and napkins. Next time I would cut the stips a bit shorter, about index-finger length, so that they won't droop when dipping.

boursin and lamb. chives and creme fraiche. parmesan asiago and oregano. it's a great base recipe, but dressing them makes for great appetizers.

A good recipe for potato skins. The whole family enjoyed them.

Just right. This is a good appetizer dish. A money saver for sure. Serve with a dip. A win-win recipe overall.

I added parmesan and cheddar cheese to the baked potato skins. I served them at a Super Bowl party and they were a hit!

My husband and I thought these crispy potatoes were delicious. The only change I made to the original recipe was sprinkling garlic powder on the skins along with the paprika, salt and pepper. I'll make this one again and again!

The choice of this recipe was borne because we had forgot to pick up potatoes at the supermarket and we were down to our last four!!. plus one sweet potato. The potato skins were superp. the potoato that was left was mashed with the sweet potato and loads of black pepper. With steamed cauliflower this accompanied Lambs Liver with port. A glass of Spanish Rioca.......Cheers.

I am a BIG fan of potatoes anyway you slice 'em. I have a great stuffed potato recipe. Bake the large potato, lay it on its side, and slice the very top off only in the middle. Empty out the innards and mash them with milk and butter, mix in crumbled bacon, lots of scallions, tiny bits of broccoli heads, and cheese cheese cheese. Stuff it all back in (you may have a bunch sticking out of the top). Bake again and serve with sour cream and chives (or more scallions) YUM!

I had made this and 1/2 of the skins i used fresh bason(cooked crisp and dice very small) and fresh cheddar cheese topped the skins and the other 1/2 i left with no condiments. My guests really enjoyed the selection.I alaso served it with sour cream mixed with fresh chives.

Needs more than just oil and spices. We made it by adding cheddar cheese and bacon bits and then putting in oven until cheese melted.
