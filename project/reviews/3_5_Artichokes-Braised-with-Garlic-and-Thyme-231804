Finally another way to cook artichokes besides steaming or boiling. I liked this, but made adjustments as others have suggested. 1/4 cup of oil is not needed, just enough to saute as you normally would. I also quartered the artichokes to clean as others mentioned. I put them into lemony water to try to keep them from turning color.

This was amazing. I didn't have parsley, but when I braised the artichokes I added some chardonnay, chicken broth, lemon juice, and some herbs de provence.

This was very good, but not fabulous. I liked the flavors and found it easy to prepare. But the artichokes were greasy. However, we enjoyed them. I don't know that I would make this recipe again.

This was an easy recipe. I did make a slight change: I used 1/4 cup white wine and 1/2 cup water to deglaze the pan. I put about 8 cloves of garlic into the sauce. The artichokes were tender and tasty, but the sauce was to die for! My husband served his and poured sauce down into the artichoke--that made it even better.

I thought this recipe was delicious. We love artichokes and typically just boil them but this was a very tasty and different way to make one of our favorite foods! I particularly loved the garlic. I would recommend adding more of the braised garlic to the sauce. The thyme sprigs are also very tasty to eat whole after they have been cooked this way.

excellent recipe used baby artichokes and this is the best recipe ive found for them. i braised them in a combination of white wine, lemon and chicken broth -- no bitterness

have been looking for a prep other than steam or boil and found this to be really good, followed the recipe closely with the only addition of adding lemon juice to the bowl of water that held the chokes after I cleaned them.

This was very easy & good. Next time I'll add more garlic - the cooked cloves were fantastic in the sauce & spread on bread.

Very good! Definitely cut the artichokes in half and remove the choke. Next time I will add more water and cut down on the oil. I didn't think the sauce needed oil either. Delicious and so easy!

IT HAS POTENTIAL I WOULDNT MAKE IT AS IS I'm not sure how to add forks yet so I will say this is a 2 fork before my and others suggestions. This was very greasy. I would half the oil and add some water. Covered it would help it steam a bit and not brown to much. The method is a good idea and I like not loosing all the flavor in the water as when you boil it. I also quartered 2 really big chokes to aid in cooking. I used some olive oil with finely grated parmesean cheese, lime juice and greek seasonings to dip.

I really liked this dish. I went by the review advice to quarter the artichokes (which made the prep MUCH easier - I don't know how you'd get the hair out without mangling the artichoke otherwise) and to deglaze with wine. There wasn't much left in the pan when it was done, but I added a little oil and sauteed some green beans on the seasoned pan as well and they turned out wonderfully. It was the first time I wasn't tempted to add a butter/hollandaise topping to an artichoke. WONDERFUL!

The artichokes turned out really well. I used only two small artichokes but didn't cut down on the rest of the ingredients... After the artichokes were cooked I removed them from the pot and added 8 or so small organic carrots with the tops cut off. I also used white wine instead of water to deglaze, but I still felt the sauce needed more after, so I added a few lemons and spices. I didn't think the dipping sauce needed any more olive oil. The artichokes, carrots, and garlic all turned out amazing.

This recipe is easy. Once you prep the artichokes you can leave it alone to do it's thing. To make prepping the artichokes easier I just end up quartering them to remove the thistle. I'll never do artichokes any other way again.

Great dish. Liquid seemed to cook off very quickly so added extra water by 1/4 c. as needed. Also, added juice from 1/2 lemon to the braising liquid to brighten the flavors a bit. And deglazed the pan with 1/2 c. white wine as another suggested which made a superb broth.

These were fantastic -- even better the next day. Don't forget the crusty bread!

So, I've never cooked artichokes this way before and I think that I must have gotten the timing/seasonings, etc wrong or something. I didn't have any wine to add, and I think that that would have definitely helped. It was just a little weak. I will make it again, though, to see if it is better a second time.

The artichokes at our grocery store looked awful, so I made a version of this using brussel sprouts instead. With very minor adjustments to the recipe, it was easy and the result was absolutely delicious.

Easy and got rave reviews. A nice change of pace.

Combo of ingredients was good, but process was too much trouble. Easier way: cut 'choke in half, easily cut out fuzz with paring knife, and rub all cut surfaces with lemon. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a roasting pan with 'chokes, cut side down. Cover and bake at 375-ish for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake another 30 minutes until nicely browned. Way easier, just as good.

My husband & I loved it! It was such a different way to prepare than I've done in the past. I have to admit getting the choke out was harder than expected, but it was worth it. The thyme was a wonderful flavor and I also used wine like another reviewer had done. Simply delicious!

I thought this recipe was awesome! My family has been obsessed with artichokes since I was a child, but have never had them braised. My mom and I had these for dinner last week and she is still begging me to make them exactly the same way again. This is our new favorite way to eat artichokes!

loved it. added white wine instead of the water at the end. mine were a little over cooked at the recommended time, but they were delicious!

Haven't tried this yet, but the easiest way to get the choke out is to use a grapefruit spoon.

It was only ok. Not much different than steamed artichokes but with a different flavor and more hassle. I didn't bother taking out the choke before cooking, just removed it when eating the artichoke.

In the review that follows this one, I forgot to say that after halving the arthicokes, I stuffed the parsley sprigs into a few leaves on each half of each artichoke.

I like this one a lot, very easy and the garlic is tasty, as others have said. I used med-large artichokes and cut them in half lengthwise. This makes it easier to remove the choke and to make sure both sides get browned in the pan. I use a melon baller (the end with the straight edge, not the rounded edge) to remove the choke easily. Other than halving the artichokes, I followed the recipe. My family eats a lot of artichokes so this is a nice, quick addition to our repertoire. In case you haven't checked out the artichokes with goat cheese and the artichokes with lemon and dill (both on this site), those are also two favorites of ours.

I don't get it. Mine turned out only OK. I must admit this is the first time I ever cooked artichoke but it did nothing for me. I must have done something wrong....I just can't figure out what. By the way, getting the choke out is a major hassle. Any clues to making this easier?

Wowie! That's the first thought as I pulled off a leaf and scraped the delicious flesh into my mouth. This one is definitely a keeper. Super easy and very flavorful. I did think about the hot oil/water thing, but too late. So my stove got a little splattered, nothing new in my kitchen! Cheer to the creator of this gem.

What a wow for artichoke lovers! Such a different take on them, so much easier in many ways and so much more flavorful than the usual "steam" method! Serving the artichokes on a plate alongside the roasted garlic to spread on the bread, well, just awesome! A note to prior cooks...you never heat a pan and then add water and oil, without getting hurt! This was so easy....place artichokes, garlic, thyme, etc in pot, add oil, water, cover, then turn on heat. Never add oil and water to a pot after heating, or you'll get hurt! I did add at intervals 1/4 cup more water at a time (and pourded on top of an artichoke so as not to hit oil/pan directly) as I didn't believe the chokes would cook sufficiently in the time alloted. WRONG! Follow the recipe, just add a bit more water, from time to time. We're a family that has lived on artichokes with hollandaise and butter, for years, my dad who hated them would go away on business, and my mom, sister & I would purchase 9 artichokes, 3 per person!, and make a triple batch of hollandaise, and feast! Well no more...this is now our most favorite recipe! If you like artichokes, you are going to love this one! And by the way, scraping out the spikes with a spoon took only a few minutes per choke, it was no big deal! And the taste of the parsley on the inner leaves, just awesome! Artichoke lovers, you'll truly enjoy this one!

and (if you will forgive me) to the writer in utah....a 'choke to me is the whole thing. not just the center part (the heart). peeling the stem is essential, because you eat that also. nothing satisfies like taking a 'choke one leaf at a time over time and finding those green and purple ones in the center. make sure you have a 'toss bowl for all the inedible leaf fragments). then grab all of the tender center leaves off and eat 'em all at once, avoiding the harder, stringy parts. after you cut off the 'hair' from the core, eat the heart of it. do it over a candle lit table with a lover or a good friend. while you do all this, talk about love, religion, or politics. you can't do it any other way. light a candle. make sure you have clean sheets on the bed. you will be amazed. an artichoke heart is just the core. take your time, and with someone, with a real artichoke. there is a kind of truth in it. it is a symbol for life. doing the heart only is like having sex with a friend and then not calling her the next day....

ok. short and sweet. i liked this recipe, mainly because i live a short distance from Castroville CA (the artichoke capital of the world) and Gilroy CA (the garlic capital of the world and home of the infamous Garlic Festival). but i gotta be careful. there's a canadian woman out to get me here on epicurious (see shrimp curry, this website). um...ok... so, follow the recipe exactly, but be careful about the 1/4 cuppa water in the second step. hot oil and water do not mix well. i know you better informed folks know this already. the lady in canada knows it i'm sure. but the 'chokes were delicious this way. i could peel away the leaves in the usual way, even with bandages on my hands. it was a nice change from tofu. thanks.

I love artichokes and this was delicious, but what a lot of work & mess to get the choke out! Next time I make it I will just remove the prickly inner leaves and leave the choke in til it's cooked.
