They should call this four-hour lasagna! I made this for Thanksgiving with friends, and it was a huge hit--fed 8 or 9 people, with several going back for seconds, and still had 4 servings left over. However, I wish I'd read further down in the reviews to the people who said it took 3.5 hours before baking--it took me every minute of that and more, and I did as much simultaneously as I could. I made it with butternut squash instead of zucchini, and I'd agree that the porcinis can probably be slightly downsized, but I wouldn't skip the mushroom juice--the porcinis have a lovely meaty flavor that adds to the dish's interest. Anyway, a big hit, but don't even think about it unless you plan to cook all day, or make both filling and sauce the day before.

I first made this about 10 years ago to feed the vegetarians at my Thanksgiving table. It was an instant classic, the vegetarians and meat-eaters alike gobbled it up, and it has been expected every year since. Yes, it's rich - I use 1% milk, and it's just fine. Yes, it's time-consuming. Yes, it freezes well - I assemble it, bake it for about half the recommended time, cool completely, and freeze. I thaw it the night before the big feast, and finish baking it. And finally, no, it doesn't matter what mushrooms you use. I use mixed dried mushrooms and whatever fresh mushrooms I can find.

The reviews are true... this is time consuming, but really really delicious! I made just a couple changes: different mix of mushrooms (used 5 kinds: crimini, portobello, velvet piopinni, dried porcini, dried shitake), and used lowfat instead of whole milk for the beschamel (still came out rich and delicious - definitely recommend!). It turned out great! When I initially read the recipe, I couldn't see how this could take hours to prepare, but I guess I didn't notice just how many steps were involved in making the filling. I made my own pasta, which added to the time issue, but was really delicious. It's totally worth the effort. Next time, I'll try to make the filling the night before.

Delicious; I have made this four times, and it's been a hit without fail, even amongst the meat-and-potatoes, "I don't like mushrooms" crowd. I used shitake instead of porcini.

Rating: 4
Delicious and worth the effort. I had to make substitutions (not too many) because I failed to read in depth before I went shopping. I did use fresh mozzarella and parmesan from the Casa della Mozzarella on Arthur Avenue and fresh pasta sheets. But I only had 1.5 lbs of fresh mushrooms so I upped the quantity of dried mushrooms. I also didn't have zucchini but did have some baked butternut squash which I used instead. It was delicious, rich, gooey and wonderful. My husband said it was better than restaurant fare!

This is a very tasty lasagne! We couldn't find porcini on short notice and substituted with shiitake, which worked very well. This isn't a recipe for the calorie conscious - it is incredibly rich. We replaced the whole milk with 1%, and it was still very heavy. We ended up a little short on filling, and also felt we could've used more of the fresh thyme we'd bought without overpowering the other flavors. If you go with fresh mozarella (recommended!), make sure you buy enough!

This was a very rich dish...almost too rich but a small piece of lasagne with a salad and garlic bread proved to be a delicious meal. Going for seconds would possibly result in an overload but this recipe, with the right sides, is delectable.

Rating: 3
I cooked all the mushrooms at once, and then cooked the onion, garlic and zucchini together and then combined them. Makes for a few less steps, and it came out fine. I also made the filling the night before and then assembled the day of, and again, it worked great. This is a nice, rich, tasty dish -- works well for a vegetarian main course, or for any meal.

Rating: 4
Delicious - but how can you go wrong with mushrooms and cheese?? Very time consuming. I thought I could knock it out in 2 hours. It took me 2 hours just to make the filling. It took another 2 hours to make the sauce and assemble it. I only had 1/2 the porcini mushrooms it called for on hand, but it still had wonderful mushroom flavor.

I love this recipe, and it's the only one I ever make when craving a lasagne! I can't bring myself to move on! I add 227-340g chorizo to the filling, and use about 340-454g of mozza instead of 227g.

Really good. Made it for a New Year's Eve dinner with a couple of vegetarian friends. As others have noted, the recipe easily serves 8 (I ended up with a dozen slices). Obviously, it's a decent amount of work, but it's really not so bad and doing it all ahead allowed me to enjoy spending time with my guests once the party started instead of being stuck in the kitchen doing last-minute prep. The idea of chopping the mushrooms up so small was inspired---it really helped the lasagna stay together for a nice presentation on the plate, and it made for a lovely texture. And the super-reduced porcini soaking liquid really made it---do not skip that step! I served with the Balthazar salad: mixed greens with blanched haricots verts and asparagus plus a little avocado, ricotta salata, and radishes, all topped with a lemon truffle vinaigrette. YUM!

This is a delicious lasagna, though not low cal or low fat. It is a great company dish. As vegetarians, it's always difficult to find a unique recipe to make for company in advance and this recipe fits the bill. I prepped it the day before and didn't bake it until the following evening. Very tasty and very filling. You can easily serve 6-8 people. I used regular lasagna noodles which I boiled al dente during prep, as I don't care for the no-boil. I used a combination of different fresh mushrooms, and added some vegetable stock when I sauteed the drier Shitake mushrooms. I also roasted some asparagus in the oven instead of the zucchini and added that to the mushroom mixture before I assembled the dish. I would say it was about average time to prepare for any great homemade lasagna. Well worth it.

Delicious. I made it for a dinner party and everyone asked for seconds. My only concern was with the directions. (Since no one else seemed to have trouble with them, maybe it's just me?) I'm still not sure about the order of layers. After outlining the first set of layers, I wasn't clear on whether I needed to add a layer of lasagne BEFORE adding the sauce, etc. again?? Otherwise, it's definitely worth making.

I just reviewed this, but did anyone else half a ton of the sheets of lasagne leftover? I had one pound, and used probably only half after following the directions. Maybe I missed something!

This lasagne was delicious. Hands down the best I have ever eaten, left alone made. Yes, it is incredibly time consuming. I probably spent 3.5 hours on it, excluding baking, but I also did dishes and took my time in between, as an attempt to save time (go figure!). Would I make this again? Definitely, but I would have to be in another cooking-all-day type of mood and really wanting to be in the kitchen, which was perfect for today. I only had one ounce of the porcini mushrooms (turns out they are pricey), and I might try omitting them next time as I saw someone else simmered down vegetable broth instead. I might also try adding more veggies for color, or at least do a salad on the side. Please at least try it once if you haven't. Delicious!

I made this for my neighborhood Bunco night for 16 women. It turned out fabulous. I altered the recipe a little. I used 2% instead of whole milk, and I replaced some of the white button mushrooms with Portobello and Shitake. Everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe.

Forgot to add..I just skipped the zucchini entirely. It sounded like a lot of work. I am glad I did, because I think it might have taken away from the intensity of the mushroom flavors.

I was determined to make this recipe in less than the vast amounts of time everyone else said it would take. Here's what I did: chopped the mushrooms by hand (I used a mix of fresh white, crimini, and portabella, plus dried shiitake). I did not bother with the water from the shiitakes and just used what was in the mushrooms I had sauteed. Yes, it was still a significant amount of time in the kitchen (maybe an hour and a half) but it was really worth it. My guests loved the lasagna and so did I.

I've made this dish a number of times and it turns out faboulous every time (and to great review from family and friends). I lightened the recipie a bit by using 2% milk and mostly light mozarella - don't think it hurt the flavor at all. I also used more Sherry then prescribed, an extra zucchini and added a carrot - also a great addition, i thought. my first time through this recipie, i made as is, and it was also great. A bit time consuming, but i appreciate the fact that i can make and assemble the night before and just pop in the oven before guests come (make sure you don't go from the frige straight to the oven, let it get to room temp).

Rating: 4
Made exactly as written EXCEPT used only 1.5 oz porcinis because that was all I could get. The porcini flavour was strong and gorgeous; I think 2 oz might actually be a little too much. Baked a day ahead then refrigerated; left at room temp for about 20 minutes to half an hour before reheating for 45 minutes at 375 degrees. Every guest ate thirds.

I am half way through making this lasagne. I know it will be good since my husband made it once. I have had some problems with it, however. It doesn't say what to do with the zucchini--so I chopped it in fairly big pieces. Also it tells you to boil down the porcini liquid but never tells you what to do with it. I am assuming it goes in the sauce. I'll try it and see how it works.

Rating: 3
My husband and I enjoyed this for a dinner party--would be good with more green vegetable ingredients, since the zucchini disappears into the mix. Very tasty for mushroom lovers! Didn't try to make it healthier. A bit of work but the sauce is good--don't add as much salt as called for since the parmesan is salty anyway. More elegant than your usual lasagne.

Rating: 4
Wow! This was a huge hit. The perfect, interesting comfort food for a cold winter evening. I make a meatless dinner once a month for a group, almost always from Epicurious. This received the highest praise, yet. Made the whole thing the night before and baked before serving. Served with the fennel and romaine salad from this site.

I truly went 'wild' with the mushrooms adding oyster, shitake, and baby bellas to the mix. It was incredible. I served it for a dinner party of ten and there were no leftovers as everyone asked for seconds. Fresh lasagna noodles from the Italian grocer was a nice touch. Yes, it's labor intensive but well worth the effort for something special.

Rating: 4
Made this according to the recipe and loved it. Guests asked for recipe. I am a fan of salt, so I left it as is, and it was fine. Excellent dish for vegetarians, for the non-vegetarians I sauteed some pork loin medallions (with sherry) to go with the lasagne. Roaring success!

Rating: 3
I fed this to 14 people with healthy appetites and 1/3 was left over. In the absence of zucchini, I took advantage of the many carrots I had on hand. I pulsed them in the Cuisinart, and added them to the onion and garlic, which I sauteed first. I added the mushrooms last, so everything ended up equally tender, and with fewer pots to wash. I prefer the flavor of cognac to complement mushrooms than sherry, and there was no reason to use that much salt in the filling and sauce. . .unless you want to induce high blood pressure. The cheeses are salted anyway, and people can always add salt to taste at the table; they can't remove it. Next time, I'll use skim milk. It will still be plenty rich with a whole stick of butter in the sauce. That said, I liked this lasagne a lot and I'll make it again. . .but healthier.

This is a time consuming recipe, but not so bad if you make it over 2 or 3 days. After 1st baking, the noodles looked as if they hadn't softened completely. After reheating, everything looked plump and lush. Everyone loved it. A little chopped parsley on top helps with the beige.

Delicious! I made the filling and sauce the night before and it was simple but time- consuming, so I'm glad I did it ahead of time. I added about 1 cup of toasted chopped walnuts and that really made the dish. The slight crunch was perfect. My guests and I thought it was delicious but not too rich or salty. I had a disposable aluminum lasagna pan lying around and it was nice and deep so no overflow. I'll definitely make this again!

The reviews are so helpful! I made this while vacationing on Maui, found no porcinis despite best efforts (4 stores) so I decided to just reduce some vegetable stock to 1/4 cup and added what mushrooms I could find, oyster and portabella to the buttons. I was feeding a crowd so I made a small vegeterian version, then added spicy italian sausage to the other for the meat lovers. Since I read it could turn out a little rich, I used 2 cups of vegetable stock instead of all milk in the sauce. It did take some time as there was no food processor in the rental house, but once you make it once it's always faster the next time especially when equipment is handy. One of our guests is a professional chef and I got complete props from him which absolutely made my day.

This recipe is easy but takes a little work to cook the duxelle of mushrooms. It is worth the effort to get the intense woodsy mushroomy taste. This recipe is my first choice in the fall and winter when I am entertaining vegetarian friends. I would highly recommend this recipe.

This was a delicious lasagna, but too salty (and I LIKE salt) and rich for my taste. Would lighten up the bechamel next time, using half chicken stock/half milk, and add some lemon juice to brighten it up. Would also add a layer of freshly sauteed spinach. Fewer porcini, more wild mixed mushrooms. Used a single box (15 sheets) of Barilla no-boil lasagna, which was a perfect fit for my lasagna pan. Served with a crisp bitter greens salad dressed with vinaigrette and some crusty bread, a very filling dinner! It was lovely with a very dry Rose.

This is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort, but you must be a big fan of mushrooms. My husband, a mushroom lover, did not stop raving throughout the entire meal. We both especially loved the texture achieved by putting the mushrooms in the food processor. They absorb the bechamel sauce beautifully. The lasagna also comes out the perfect texture, moist yet holding its shape when cut. I only used one ounce of porcini, however, and a mixture of white, crimini, and portabellas for the rest because I had them handy. I think the extra porcini would be a bit overpowering for my taste, but just perfect with the one ounce. I would definitely make this again and again!

I was all nervous to make this dish b/c everyone wrote about how labor-intensive it is....well, it's not, really. I used a variety of fresh mushrooms so I skipped the shroom-water madness and used a bit of chicken broth instead. It was GOOD! Restaurant quality good. I will say that the brownish hue from the mushrooms is a tad unappetizing, but that's the only drawback. Really loved it, and will make it again. Don't be scared of the reviewers who say it's 3+ hours of prep - it's easy and awesome!

I was looking for an interesting vegetarian dish to make for my beau, and this turned out really good. I don't own a food processor, but my good blender worked fine for chopping the mushrooms. I scaled back the white mushrooms and used cremini, along with a pre-packaged blend of wild mushrooms (trumpet, oyster, shitake). I used shredded asiago in addition to the parmegiano, and I added a small jar of drained artichoke hearts and a heaping tablespoon of capers for a little zest. I skipped one layer, since it was getting so high in the pan (!), but it didn't affect the recipe at all. It is a hearty dish and my boyfriend ate the leftovers for several days straight! I paired this with a lightly dressed arugula salad and a bottle of burgundy. Next time I'll go easy on the mozzarella. It is a rich dish to indulge in!

Rating: 4
Worth the effort. Impressed everyone at the table. Made a few changes though: instead of just fresh white mushrooms, used white, cremini, and shitake; instead of just dried porcini, used dried porcini, trumpet, chanterelle, and oyster; and instead of mozz., used mozz., tellegio, and fontina.

This was a major hit at my dinner party. I had vegetarians and ardent non-vegetarians so I made two: one had spicy italian sausage instead of zuchinni. I cut back on the processed mushrooms (white and baby bellas) and added sauteed sliced shitakes and a can of diced artichoke hearts to the processed mushrooms (cheaper and good too). My only other suggestion is that the recipe needs more mozzarella than what is called for if using fresh. Expensive and time-consuming, true, but I really felt the love on this recipe.

I've made this dish several times and it's always a hit. It's a nice alternative to the standard meat lasagne or along side for a party. Thought time consumeing, it's worth the effort. I also found the flavor is bolder if I prepare the ingredients a day or two before I assemble and bake.

All the rumors are true: this takes 3 to 3.5 hours to prepare (before baking). I am not complaining about the time per se, merely about the end results given the substantial time investment. It's okay, maybe even tasty, but I would prefer an honest-to-god non-vegetarian lasagne with tomato sauce. Will not be making this again.

Rating: 2
This was good, but not memorable. I was not put off, as others, by the few ingredients as good Italian dishes often are more about the quality of the good fresh foods than alot of fancy additions. The sauce is very similiar (without the porcini mushrooms) to a quick onion-tomato sauce I learned to make while living in Italy. The dish tastes very authentically Italian...but I have better recipes. The porcini taste just got lost and overwhelmed by the whole dish and it became ordinary. My family liked it...but did not request that I make it again. I was disappointed as it seemed promising. I don't think even adding other mushrooms would make it much better, maybe double the porcinis? It already has $6 worth of porcinis in it...I'd hate to waste more on a mediocre dish.

Rating: 3
One of my favorite lasagne dish. For those who are on the blood type diet "B", use 4 roasted red bell peppers instead of tomatoes for the sauce, and use 1/8t cayenne pepper instead of black pepper in the bechamel. It's wonderful. Note: the "no-boil" version of lasagne noodles works also well.

As others have noted, this is a labor intensive (though not difficult) project. But what a labor of love! The results are very tasty and pleasing.

This recipe is a LOT of work. But I would do it again. The taste is out of thie world. I made it for a dinner party. It fell apart, but no one cared because the taste was so great. To keep together, I would put a little less sauce next time and make it in a smaller (and higher) baking dish.

This was great. Made it for a group with some vegetarians and everyone - not just the veggies - loved it. I left out the squash - just not needed - and let the mushrooms star on their own.

What a wonderful dish! I made this for the vegetarians (and others) at my Thanksgiving table, and it was a huge hit! I used porcini, portobella, crimini, and shiitake mushrooms, and increased the parmesan cheese slightly. The dish was simple to make, not especially time consuming (I made it in shifts, over several days), and received raves. Yum!

This is great for entertaining. Took other reviewers advise and made it over 2 days. Yes, it's time consuming, but worth it. I substituted artichoke hearts for the zuccini, chopped them in the processor and stirred them in w/the mushroom filling. Worked very nicely. Mine was a little dryer than I would have liked but I think that was because my pan was an oversized 9x13. Also, I just used regular lasagne noodles and didn't pre-cook them. Came out great. Will be making it again soon!

This was a very good recipe. We made it as is except for not using porcini's but using a mix of mushrooms - cremini, white, portabella and shiitake, and a little broth in lieu of the porcini water. We also cut the recipe in half and used a smaller (9x9) pan. We ate one dinner meal for two, and have four single servings frozen for lunches. Next time I will not use the food processor but will just chop or slice the mushrooms myself as I think they got chopped too fine in the processor (after the first batch of chopping I hand cut some more to add for size to the chopped mixture). We also think many additions or changes would go well with this recipe ... strips of roasted red peppers or poblano too, maybe even a version with a little meat of some kind ... Italian sausage or something else. There are a lot of things you could add or change to alter the flavors in various good ways. But it is very good as is also, and we will make again for sure.

They will know how much you love them when they taste it.

This is very rich, but very worthwhile. Rather than making this the main course, I would serve it with a lightly-dressed sherry wine vinaigrette salad, and grilled or roasted meat or chicken..it makes a surperb side dish, in small quantities. Great with a full-bodied red wine.

This recipe was chosen for our Annual Shroom Event where we pool our spring morel find and have a dinner party to celebrate the haul.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful dish, but quite time consuming. Make this at least 1 day ahead, so that you're not spending the entire day in the kitchen prior to guests arriving. I think it also allows the flavors to develop and meld. This serves at least 8 people unless they are extremely hardy eaters. I served it with the mixed antipasto, which was another hit. I will make this again, but only for very special guests because of the time it takes to prepare.

I've made many, many recipes from this site, and this is without a doubt the best. It's time-consuming, as everyone else has said, but all that chopping gives you time to think! The leftovers are even good cold. Dried thyme and 2% milk worked fine. Everybody at my house was happy.

Very good. I thought the layering directions were a little confusing. The recipe calls for 18 sheets of pasta, 3 to a layer. That means 6 layers of pasta, but only 3 layers of everything else. I think they intended for the mozzerella to be between layers of pasta, but 1/2 a pound of mozzerella isn't quite enough to do that. So I added extra cheese. After I had it assembled, I was worried that it seemed too dry, but had faith and it was fine. It did take longer than 45 minutes to heat through. About twice as long, even though nothing was cold. It browned beautifully on top, and I covered with foil to prevent over-browning. Thank you to all who suggested making the filling the day before.

We made this last night and it was delicious and reheated the leftovers today and it was still great. Couldn't find dried Porcini mushrooms so we used dried Shitake mushrooms instead and the taste was amazing.

It is fairly time consuming so allow plenty of prep time or make the day before.

Great flavours in this recipe - it was a real hit with company. I had a problem with the noodles though - they seemed to disintegrate, even though the filling was not too moist. Perhaps it was the no-boil noodle variety that was available here in the Netherlands. Next time I will try the boil variety.

This is restaurant quality. And if you do it in 2 stages (make the mushroom filling the day before, then make the bechamel and assemble the day of) it's not that hard, and I made it without the use of a food processor (that's a whole lotta mushroom-chopping, folks!). I also didn't bother with the whole porcini-voodoo thing and it was still delicious.

If you're searching for that next recipe "find" (you know what I mean) this definitely qualifies. Who cares if there's a little more prep time involved if the result is this good. Besides, this dish actually tastes better if you fix it the day before. One recommendation...don't get hung up on the mushroom combination. I've made it several times using whatever is available: domestic, shitake, morels, porcini, some fresh some dried and it's always just great. It looks beautiful on the plate too.

RAVE REVIEWS, but, really, how can anything with this much butter and cheese not taste delicious?!? Moving at a leisurely pace, this dish took me almost three hours to prepare. It really is sinfully rich, so next time I might try sauteing the vegetables in olive oil and using a recipe I have for low-fat bechamel (also uses olive oil). This is the first time I've used no-boil lasagne noodles. They make assembly SO much easier and keep the final product from becoming sloppy when plated.

This is definately not an everyday, week-night dinner kind of a dish. It's expensive and it takes a lot of effort. But it's perfect for a dinner party. It's time-consuming but not difficult, and it satisfied my vegetarian and meat-eating guests alike.

I made this for a dinner party last night. One of my guests was a vegetarian and I wanted to find something that we would all enjoy. This was absolutely heavenly. The filling is slightly time consuming, but I made this a couple days a head of time in shifts. I made the filling 3 days before, and let it chill, then I made the sauce and assembled the lasagne the day before. It really wasn't that bad, and the end results were well worth it!

Excellent! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I substituted poblano peppers for the zucchini. It was fabulous.

Absolutely superb! Yes, it is labor intensive, as previous reviewers have indicated, but it is well worth the time and energy. My guests all said it's the best lasagne they ever had, and I think I agree. A very elegant vegetarian dish that will knock people's socks off!!!

I agree with the other reviewers in that it took some time to prepare. But boy was it worth it!! This was one of the best dinners that I've made --absolutely the best vegetarian meal ever!! Did use non-fat milk, which worked well. Also, store was out of dried porcini mushrooms, so used dried shitake. Still had good flavor. Also, added shitake and portabello mushrooms to the mix. Oh -- and definitely let it sit after you bake it. it has less of a tendency to fall apart after it's cooled a bit.

I made this recipe with homemade spinach lasagne noodles. The texture and the flavor of fresh pasta was incredible. I froze the whole thing and baked it later. Since this dish is so labor intensive, freezing it made easier to have this dish whenever you need want it. Just pop it out and bake it, no need to defrost it.

This was indeed a labor intensive recipe, but the end result was so yummy and gorgeous that I can't wait to make it again for a dinner party or special occasion. I used 1% milk for the sauce with fine results. Just thinking about this dish makes my mouth water!

I made this for a large dinner party of both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. It received only excellent reviews from all and was a perfect party dish as it could be prepared ahead of time. I will make this again!

I made this recipe for a party of 8, one of which was a vegetarian, the rest were pretty serious carnivores. Everyone absolutely loved this lasagne. It is a bit time consuming to make, but well worth the effort. No one missed the absence of meat. Delicious!

This is a really wonderful dish. I used the white mushrooms then fresh sliced portobellos. I used fresh lasagne pasta and did not cook it before layering. For cheese I used quark (consistency like ricotta) and mozarella. The sauce is great. At the top, because I was concerned about the pasta cooking well during baking, I thinned out my final sauce layer with non-fat milk and poured it over. It worked great. Next time I would add more thyme. My husband suggested adding some crunch...so maybe some chopped toasted walnuts. Make it ahead. It just gets better.

This is a great Lenten meal. Served to guests who loved it. However the next time I will make only half the sauce, and mix with Ricotta cheese and beaten egg. This amount of sauce made the whole dish "runny". I will also use more garlic. I agree the prep time is a killer - but worth the effort for something unusual.

This took a very long time to put together, but I felt that it was well worth the effort. It was delicious and got rave reviews from everybody who tried it. I did add more mozzarella than was called for, but otherwise I followed the recipe. Make this lasagne- you won't regret it!

True, lots of work and super rich but also leaves room for some chef creativity - embellish or substitute other ingredients to enhance the dish. I added more zucchini and some onions and mozzarella. Indeed, I was too heavy handed with extra bechamel resulting in too wet a dish. But my guests snarfed up all the excess sauce. Will serve more than the suggested number just because it is so rich in flavor.

This lasagne is excellent. Even my son who hates mushrooms is begging me to make this recipe again. I substituted 3 portebello mushrooms for the shitake mushrooms, added asiago cheese and made a 1/3 more sauce.

This is a winner every time. The only drawback is the time required to prepare. My recommendation is to prepare the day before and assemble the day you bake. The flavor is much better.

Very rich recipe. Lots of prep work. I substituted dried shitakes for the porcini.I only used half the button mushrooms and used portabellos for the other half. Very elegant vegan dish that satisfies us meat lovers too.

An excellent vegetarian make ahead dish and I'm not a vegetarian! I only used 1 ounce of porcini mushrooms and it was fine, but be sure to cut the water in half or it takes forever to simmer down to 1/4 cup (my mistake)! I also made the dish on a Sunday and froze it for a dinner party later in the week and had no problems. It did take quite awhile to make. A regular sized food processor processor is a must, which I used, but when I make it again, I'll make it in stages as suggested in a previous review.

It's the best tasting lasagna. I have found to make this dish the day before I serve, it tastes better that way cause it gives it time soak in all the flavors of the mushrooms.

I agree with most of the other comments. It took a long time to prepare (especially since I had to hand chop the mushrooms), and it could have served more people. Also, I thought the porcini mushroom measurement was off--two ounces was a lot more than one cup. More like two cups. But the dish was very good and I'd make it again (with a helper and a food processor).

I thought this lasagne was wonderful. I made it for this past Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The recipe seemed to make alot more servings than it said, though. I told everyone at work about it and they asked me to make them a batch. I'm sure they will love it too.

This is an amazing lasagne. It took me a very long time to prepare. I spent the whole day in the kitchen, but who cares. It tasted so good. Everyone loved it. My advice is to make it in stages.

This recipe was delicious -- but it took me over 2 hours to prepare (not counting cooking time)! It tasted great, but it was too much work.

We love this recipe. Like most lasagna recipes, it is a little complicated, but well worth it. It is a vegetarian meal that is so yummy no one misses the meat.

This recipe is fantastic! I did substitute skim milk for the whole milk and it still turned out very rich. Co-workers loved it as well. I will definitely make this again.
