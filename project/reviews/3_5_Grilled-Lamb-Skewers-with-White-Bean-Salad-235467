I didn't use the lamb recipe, but I made the salad. It was great!

The taste of this dish was amazing!! The only downfall was the cut of meat, so fatty it was hard to have a bite with just meat. Next time I would make this with lamb steak to avoid the fat even though it is more expensive. I would make the bean salad portion of this dish again in a heartbeat!
