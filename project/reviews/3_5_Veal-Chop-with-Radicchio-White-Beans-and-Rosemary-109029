This is a simple, remarkably delicious dinner. Some of the reviewers complain of "bitterness." Well, Radicchio IS bitter, but not alarmingly so. Moreover, the vinegar in the recipe smooths the bitterness; and the bitterness decreases markedly as the dish sits on the plate. We found that even with the first bites, the bitterness was subdued by having some bean and some veal with the radicchio in the same bite. The veal is best RARE. Use LOTS of garlic and rosemary. Add some balsamic vinegar if needed. This is a great recipe. Richard in Seattle

I made this as written and it was delicious. The radicchio did not seem bitter to me, as suggested by others. If making again I might add a bit of balsamic vinegar for the flavor and add a few more beans. Not pretty, but very tasty.

the radicchio is overpowering. i added more garlic as suggested by another reviewer and still was overwhelmed by the bitterness. Will not make this again.

I've rated this recipe, but I must admit that I made several changes. First, I only had a chicken breast, so I used that. I removed the skin, but left it on the bone. I sautéed the breast and then finished the cooking in a 400-degree oven. I also did not use radicchio, because I did not have any. Overall, very good. And as you can see, this recipe is a good jumping off point.

Incredibly flavorful dish. Used pork chops instead of veal (couldn't find the veal.) Also, I accedentally added more garlic than called for, but wouldn't go back to less the next time. This is a recipe that was simple to prepare and yet so unique that it would make a great company dish. Although it wasn't necessary, I served it with mashed potatoes which were great to sop up the juicy stuff. Sigh - really good.

Good veal and excelent radicchio. I felt that the radicchio overpowered the veal and pairing it with pork chops would be better. Maybe it is because my supermarket was out of veal chops when I went and I used veal cutlets instead

This is fantastic!!! Very restaurant-ish. We have made it with pork chops, too, to save a bit of $. Pork works well, too. I would add a little more white beans, though.

This is excellent, and easy to prepare. I used a touch of balsamic vinegar in the marinade, and spinach instead of radicchio because that's what I had on hand. Don't overcook! Would definitely do this for company sometime.

Excellent!!! I used chickpeas (only white beans on hand) had no radicchio so I used spinich instead and it still turned out great. The vinegar is key to bringing out the flavors to this recipe. Like others I added more garlic than called for, extra rosemary and some even some oregano. I highly recommend this dish. I can't wait to try it with the original ingredients

Delicious. Tasted just like something you'd get in a top notch restaurant. Followed the recipe to a T.

This was absolutely incredible--better than most restaurants. Next time, I will double the sauce because it is so wonderful. I sort of expected a bitter component from the radicchio, but not at all. It was amazing. It would be great with thick cut pork chops, too....if cutting costs. :) My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Delicious, easy & elegant. Made this for a weeknight dinner with my husband, with a veal chop, and it was great. Would definitely make again. For the cook who found it was too liquid, you might increase your cornstarch just a bit.

Really good. In lieu of veal I used bone-in Neiman ranch pork chop and it was great. Also went heavier on garlic and rosemary rubbed on meat.

Pretty good. Veal was excellent. Radicchio might need a little brown sugar. Easy to make. Mine turned out too liquidy...would reduce the amount of broth.

We loved this. The house filled with the scent of rosemary and garlic, and it drew us to the table. We substituted pork loin chops for the veal, and loved it just the same. I'd increase the radicchio next time and I'd serve it with a simple green salad. Perfect winter eating.
