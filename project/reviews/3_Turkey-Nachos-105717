Delicious nachos! They took a while to make, but it was worth it. I didn't add turkey and forgot to use scallions, didnt really miss it though. The red peppers added a wonderful texture to the nachos. A great nacho recipe!

I love all the crunchy veggies. This is a healthy way to use leftover turkey. I miss the traditional nacho flavor and so may leave out the cumin next time. But I like these enough that I will eat it several times this week to use that turkey!

These were a HUGE hit! Everyone loved them! I used chicken instead of turkey and added a small can of mild diced chiles to the layers. Perfect!

Quantities seem off: way too many bell peppers for the amount of chips. Tasted pretty good; took quite a bit of time to chop the peppers and cilantro (more like 45 minute prep). I might improvise my own recipe with this as a backbone.

Great recipe. For those who like a little spice try adding Tabasco Chipolte hot sauce, spices it up nicely.

We really liked these. Like others, I made with roasted chicken. This recipe is a nice one during the holidays because the flavors wake up your taste buds. It's also a good one for improvisation. I'll definitely make again.

Made this for a huge fraternity super bowl party. Takes more time to prepare than I thought it would. Couldn't really taste the lime, but the jalapeno sour cream was awesome. People who were willing to try it liked it, but I think this was just too up-scale for the frat-boys. Like any nachos, if this is left out, like at a party, the chips get soggy. I will make this again, but next time I'll give myself more time and make sure I'll make it for a crowd that will appreciate it.

Made it a little different but was very pleasantly surprised. Left out the bell peppers since we hate those. The turkey in lime is sublime. Used a spoonful of mild green chiles in the black beans, and sauteed onions and garlic (didn't have scallions). Used cumin and oregano but didn't have cilantro. Sour cream on the side. This is a great way to use leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

Yumm-O!!! so good and so different from that standard, I really loved the flavor of the peppers, I used one orange, one red and one yellow. I also used 2 cans of beans instead of one and doubled the cilantro. The sour cream is a must and also I suggest highly some homemade guacamole to go along side. I will be making this again for sure, maybe with rotisserie chicken next time as I wont have my left over turkey very often.

Love it. Perfect Sunday afternoon treat. Made it both times with leftover chicken - the second time with blue chips, extra sliced jalapenos on one layer and added about 1/2 can chopped tomatoes and green chilis (Fiesta/10oz can) around the edges before baking. Also served with a bowl of guacamole and a bowl of plain sour cream for those who aren't so wild about jalapenos.

Nothing like real nachos in my opinion. Pretty bland even with extra jalapenos. There are better recipes out there for nachos and for leftover turkey - make the Great After Thanksgiving Turkey enchiladas - they are great!

great quick meal for leftover turkey that the kids can enjoy. Serving it with a tasty salsa added to the flavor.

These are very tasty. The recipe works quite well with chicken. I have made them several times since discovering the recipe.

I use this recipe for beef nachos instead of the turkey. I made it once and just last week was asked to make it again. That constitutes a hit in my book! So feeling I just make it as a meal. The deli spicy cheese really makes this special. When my family wants nachos, they want real nachos!

This is a great, out-of-the ordinary dinner, especially when served with beer or margaritas. Unlike the usual turkey leftover meals (pot pie, tetrazinni, etc.) it's not at all reminiscent of its Thanksgiving origins. Just the ticket when you can't stand to eat turkey AGAIN.

I've been doing variations on this for years. Also great with shredded roast chicken. It's absolutely delicious and so much lower in fat than ground beef nachos. We eat them by the platter full.

Wow, we loved these! They were very flavorful, and a great answer to the huge leftover bird creating guilt in the refrigerator following Thanksgiving dinner. Didn't seem like leftovers at all. We did skip the bell pepper layer and used plain jack cheese and nacho jalapeno slices, which suits our individual tastes better. Family of 5 really devoured them and appreciated a bit of Tex-Mex following Turkey Day. This may become our Saturday-night-after-Thanksgiving tradition!

I used smoked turkey and I like Cilantro. We served it for a grey cup (canadian football final) with kots of cold beer and followed with carne asada (an old irish dish) and it was great

The best use of leftover turkey I've made in awhile! I used the cumin in the beans--gave them a really nice aroma and taste, I thought. Worthy of serving on their own. I've never been able to acquire a taste for cilantro, so I left it out--a half cup sounds like over-kill to me. It's got a powerful taste and I think it would hide some of the other tastes going on. I also added pickled jalapenos with the red pepper layer, for added heat. Next time I might sauteeing fresh jalapenos with the bell peppers. This will be a post Turkey-Day standard!

Being of hispanic heritage and knowing that we do not use cumin except in beef dishes, I left it out from the beginning and really cut back on the garlic. I would definitely try it again my way.
