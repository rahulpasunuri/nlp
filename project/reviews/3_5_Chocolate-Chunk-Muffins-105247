Made these (no substitutions) in a chocolate muffin taste test with the Dorie Greenspan choc choc chunk muffins, using a mix of Callebaut semi-sweet and bitter sweet for the chopped chocolate and Hersheys for the unsweetened (no weighing necessary - Yay!). From the ingredients to the mixing directions they are definitely more like little cakes. I found them to be quite rich. I think the crumbly-ness and tendency to sink might be due to the amount of chocolate chunks in them and the fact that the time has to be watched closely at the end of cooking. Anyway, even the crumbs were moist, and my family gobbled them up. Made 16 muffin/cakes

normal. that's it. you can either make them to realize you won't make them again, or skip that step and keep searching for the perfect chocolate muffin.

This turned out very well, even though I did not have any eggs, or enough milk or chocolate. I had half the amount of milk, so I added some evaporated milk with water. For each egg I added two tbs of cornstarch and 1.5 tbs of water. I used cocoa powder for some of the chocolate because I didn't have enough bars. But this still came through and tasted wonderful! The texture was a little bit weird but that's probably because of all the substitutes I had. I will definitely make these again, the right way!

I'm not a very good baker and my muffins tend to turn out flat and not very fluffy but I decided to give these a try...they turned out great, plump and moist. Added a little extra flour and baking powder as one of the most recent reviewers suggested, and used my KitchenAid standing mixer for mixing. Maybe I am a baker after all...

My children loved these. I used chocolate chips and baker's chocolate and they turned out great. Also, I used the mini muffin tins and that kept them together without crumbling.

This recipe is wonderful... I did add 1/4 cup more of flour and 1 tsp of baking powder like suggested by others. This one is absolutely a keeper and really recommended for easyness and powerful in chocolate. Everyone who loves chocolate will enjoy them... Gourmet never lets me down.

I had the same trouble with flat tops, but the kids liked the contrast between crunchy top and fudgy interior. I was afraid during mixing that I'd used too much milk, and I did have to bake them an extra 4 minutes over the max time, but they tasted great. I substituted 1/2 t almond extract for the vanilla, and it gives them a nice kick.

Whoops, I mixed the ingredients in a totally different order, but it all worked out fine. I made a double recipe and did 12 regular muffins and 48 mini muffins. Regular muffin, silicon tray, no liners: 22 minutes. Regular muffin, metal tray, no liners: 25 minutes. Mini muffin, metal tray, foil-paper liners: 15 minutes. Also, in place of the whole milk (Pfft, who uses whole milk for anything anyway) I used 3 parts unsweetened almond milk, 1 part canola oil.

I was concerned when making this recipe because a few people mentioned in their reviews that their muffins did not rise. However I found that mine rose really well. Also after the dough was made it had a weird consistency, but they actually turned out quite wonderful. I would definitely make this recipe again.

These were delicious and relatively easy to make. I did not have any trouble with them collapsing/ not rising. I did cook them for about 5 minutes less than the recipe called for, though.

These were very good. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, skim milk instead of whole, splenda brown sugar mix and flaxseed meal instead of butter (3-to-1 ratio).

They came out fantastic. You need to be sure that you don't over mix them. I did not use a mixer at all - just a wooden spoon. They were moist and everyone loved them.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I am going to try it. It seems to me just looking over the recipe, that perhaps it needs baking powder in addition to the baking soda, or buttermilk in place of whole milk so the soda has something to react with. That could be the reason for no rise muffins from the previous reviewer. I think buttermilk would also help with the dryness issue; it seems to have a knack for keeping baked goods moist. Of course, you could use plain yogurt in place of buttermilk; they work the same!

I thought that the muffins were really tasty, but they didn't rise. I followed the recipe to a T and still can't figure out why.

We don't know what we did wrong, but our muffins were really crumbly and really flat. We made 24 muffins and still had extra batter but the recipe says it only is supposed to make 12 muffins. They were also quite bitter. I would not make these muffins again.

I love chocolate and have been looking for a "moist chocolate muffin" recipe. Well, this recipe didn't fit the bill. I followed the recipe with one exception -- I added around 1/3 cup more flour so the muffins wouldn't be super-crumbly. That was a mistake - they came out bone dry! Oh well, I will continue my search for Fabulously Moist Chocolate Muffins.

I thought this was a TERRIBLE recipe. there was so much butter my muffin cases were soaked in oil and my muffins were strangely FLAT. they rose beautifully for ten minutes and spent the last 15 sinking into oily crispy bits.

It was really hard not to eat all the batter before baking these. I also used chocolate chips and the muffins turned out very well. I am definitely going to make these again!

Delicious! Very rich & moist. I made exactly as the recipe stated, except I used chocolate chips. Did not find that they crumbled. Everyone loved them. This recipe is definately a keeper.

Hey guys, it is not difficult. If you have trouble with them being too crumbly, add an extra egg or a tiny bit more fat-oil. Has always done the trick for me.

These were totally yummy.. Best chocolate muffins I've ever eaten. I used good chocolate that I got from King Author Flour. Took the advise of previous reviewer and added the extra fourth cup flour. I had no crumbs.

My 6yr old & I were in a cafe two days ago and she had a similar choc. muffin. She said these were better. Based on the comments, I increased the flour by 1/4 cup. I also cut sugar by 1/4 cup as I find most recipes too sweet. The result was still a very moist muffin but didn't really crumble so much. I had no crumbs and my daughters plate had some. I may increase the flour a little more next time.

not great, falling apart. not worth the trouble

We loved these! I added a little grated orange peel, and used chocolate chips instead of chunks. They are a little delicate, so it's best to bake them in the paper muffin cups. Just think of them as a chocolate cupcake sans frosting, rather than a sturdy breakfast muffin.

Rating: 3
This was a very good recipe. i didn't put water half way in the cups and i didn't use chunks of chocolate. Another thing i did differently was, i cooked them for 5 minutes, then took them out and put in those little reeces peanut butter cups. i kept baking them. they were very delicous, with a chocolate peanut butter taste.

I am a Baker for a Local Deli... I tried these out on my Kids first... And what a MESS... I had muffin all over the place.. The muffin just does not hold together well at all..,but it did have a wonderful favor..

Yes, this is a very crumbly muffin; more cake-like than some other muffin recipes, but worth the mess! I added about 2 tsp. of instant espresso powder that punched up the chocolate taste even more. These are delicious and stay moist for several days when carefully wrapped (and hidden from view). I probably wouldn't serve these as a breakfast muffin, but for a late-morning or afternoon coffee break? Mmmmm . . .

I followed this recipe to the letter. The flavor was good but I definitely agree with some cooks about the texture. There were crumbs everywhere while my kids were eating them (at the table with a plate!)Perhaps it is better to make a mini muffin to avoid this problem.

Stop looking for a muffin recipe and put on your apron... these are wicked awesome!!! This is a 4-forker in taste, a 3-forker for presentation - couldn't get them to rise well. I didn't have light brown so I used white sugar... didn't have whole so I used skim milk. Used big fat chocolate chips - WOW! The result was light, cakey yet rich and chocolately goodie@

Who writes these recipes? IF I am planning, as recipe states, to get 12 muffins, WHY would I prepare 14 muffin tins? My tins come in sets of 12, this requires a whole other tin. Is there something special about filling some of the cups with water??? I did need two sets, as I got 18 muffins, so I filled the extra cups with water. ALSO, I find that a 12 oz. pkg. of chocolate chunks/chips measures to just under 2 cups, so I used 1/2 c. with the unsweetened chocolate, and 2 cups as chunks, totaling much more than 10 oz. Maybe this is why I got more muffins. I would call these brownie muffins, as that is what they really are. They are yummy, but confusing!

i followed recipe exactly except i made mini muffins...yielded 60.. and PERFECT 'structural integrity'.. they were moist and light and ohhhh!! the batter was like divine choc. mousse... probably would have yielded 70 mini muffins except i couldnt stop eating the batter!!

I accidentally melted all chocolate together, so the muffins came out very dark and no chunk. They were, however, very good, somewhat on the crumbly side, but good. They stuck very hard to the muffin tin, since I had no muffin liners. Cannot wait to make them again, right, and serve to friends with morning coffee.

Try making this recipe like you would muffins...melt choc and butter together,blend in eggs by hand,use a lite hand with dry ingrediants. ( I used less milk) Very tasty.

The flavor on these were good but, as my husband put it, "They had no structural integrity." Really crumbly. Good, if you eat 'em over a plate.

I made these for breakfast and they were wonderful.
