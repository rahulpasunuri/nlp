Amazing! I followed the recipe completely. Only change is my pan was a larger square so it baked in 18 minutes. But, worked great- TOTALLY "fudgey" like I love. Will make this recipe again and again and again....

These are amazing brownies and so incredibly easy to make. They are even easier than the cocoa brownies. My co-workers loved these over the cocoa brownies (but they still ate all of both kinds). I would recommend using mini-choclate chips as they chips don't completely melt down while baking. I also added some almond extract the last time I made them-they were even BETTER!

I made a batch 2 hours ago - and there are none left! What better review? (Apart from how easy they were to make). Loved this recipe.

These brownies are amazing!! I melt the chocolate over steaming water to avoid burning the chocolate. I get rave reviews from my friends every time I make the brownies. They come out moist and perfect!

delicious recipe always use this for family and parties. I add about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. It's a winner every time.

I made this recipe and really enjoyed making it, getting dirty and eating it at the end. I had them at my baby shower when I was pregnant and everyone loved them. THe indulgence and flavour just explodes in your mouth. P.S. IF YOU HAVE NOT MADE THEM MAKE THEM NOW!

Delicious, moist, perfect even though I'm not a brownie person. Like others, I used semi-sweet instead of bittersweet chocolate and kept the semi-sweet chips as is. It was more like 35-40 minutes in the oven.

A winner every time. You can get a little crazy with this too. I have replaced some of the butter with a little bacon fat. I have also added bitters. This is a go-to on a regular basis.

Very easy to make, and a little rich for my taste...next time I think I will try semi-sweet instead of the bittersweet. My husband, who has a big sweet tooth, loved them!

i had to substitute 1/2 choc. chips and unsweetened chocolate. they were ok, but not fantastic.

Made these for a dinner party to rave reviews. One guest asked that I make them again for a gathering a few days later! One note: even though I have an oven thermometer and was baking at the correct temp, still took me about 10 minutes longer than suggested and even then they were just this side of "molten".

Easy and delicious. I've made these several times with some variations (used cocoa powder once when I ran out of unsweetened choc, or added nuts) and always had success and rave reviews.

If you love chocolate, this is the perfect recipe. It is quick and easy to make, and the brownies turn out very moist.

A great and simple recipe. I like to go overboard by using Valrhona 71% or El Ray Apamate 73.5% chocolate and topping with a ganache and cocoa nib sprinkles. Rich and decadent as can be!

These are delicious brownies that are incredibly easy to make. I have made these numerous times and they are always a big hit! I like to use semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet, and sometimes I leave out the chocolate chips. No matter what they are always popular.

I'm not even much of a brownie fan, but I loved these - they're dense and not too sweet and basically just pure chocolate. I don't know who cuts them small enough to make 16, though - I made 9, and even the people in my office who "don't like sweets" ate entire brownies!

Really fudgy brownies, very yummy and easy too. I would subsitute more semi-sweet for the bittersweet in the future, but that's just a personal preference. Definitely will make again!

Yummy - I don't know how anyone couldn't love this recipe. It was so decadent and chewy and moist!!!! They went faster than anything I've made before!!!

I have made these brownies several times and always receive rave reviews. The addition of the bittersweet chocolate gives them a different taste. They are delicious just as the recipe is written but I add 1 cup chopped walnuts. This is a winner every time.

These are very dense brownies. They're delicious, but make them if you want a more fudge-like, less chewy brownie.

Great brownies - moist and yummy! I alternate between these and another of my fave brownie recipes on this site (Katharine Hepburn's Brownies). These brownies are a little bit more cake-like and easier to cut into squares. Katharine's brownies are so moist you almost have to eat them right out of the pan, since they are tough to cut. I brought these to a BBQ and they got rave reviews - made recipe exactly as is and dusted with powdered sugar.

A chocolate lovers heaven! Very dense in chocolate flavor. I used 1/2 c milk chocolate chips and they tasted great. Made these for Valentine's Dinner and served it with homemade Vanilla ice cream. Couldn't ask for a better coupling...Need I say more!

Warning: You will eat all of them yourself. This was my first time making brownies from scratch and I will never go back to the box again! These are absurdly fabulous!

These are delicious. It is now my favorite brownie recipe. The 25 min. exactly baking time is perfect. This is one brownie recipe I can make and be sure of the results. I brought them to a friend and kept some for myself but immediately put them in the freezer before I devoured them.

This recipe is our family favorite; we've made it countless times. They're so good my 9-year old son learned to make them by himself and won't allow "regular" brownies. We always use Ghiradelli chocolate chips (and Ghiradelli double chocolate chips for the bittersweet chocolate). Enjoy!

I thought I would be better than this but it is too dry and too sweet even if I use less sugar than the recipe said. Very disappointed.

The very best brownies I have ever baked. They were very rich and moist. My brownies are usually underdone in the center and/or overcooked around the edges. These were perfect! I cannot believe they came out of my oven.

Quick and easy to make and very chocolatey. Might want to add some of your favourite nuts into the batter. I'v tried the Joy of Cooking recipe and wasn't impressed with the results. Use the best chocolate you can get your hands on and you'll be pleased with the results.

I agree with the cook who recommended the recipe from the Joy of Cooking. That is the best brownie I've ever made. I usually add a few tablespoons of cocoa powder and two tablespoons of heavy cream. Seems to make it more moist (and chocalately) Also, I always use Sharfenberger chocalate--by far the best chocalate I've ever tasted.

A very good recipe! Very chocolatey without being too sweet. I added 3/4 cup white chocolate chips, and upped the semi-sweet chocolate chips to 3/4 cup--I'm an over-the-top kind of gal! (Next time I will add 1/4 cup more flour to compensate for the addition of chocolate chips). Mine came out very fudgey, so I cut them in very small squares. These would be pretty topped with a dusting of powdered sugar then placed in pretty paper cups.

By far the best brownie recipe ever created. I made this and Joy of Cooking's recipe using Valrhona dark bittersweet (71% cocoa -- for serious chocolate lovers only)and there was absolutely no comparison. My only adjustment: adding the chips at the end seemed like gilding the lily -- if you're using good chocolate to begin with, the chips are superfluous.

Rating: 4
The best brownies I've ever made--but haven't made the Joy of Cooking recipe that seems to get so much praise. Therefore, these are my best so far--I followed recipe exactly and used quality chocolate--even in the chips--it really makes a difference!

It's pretty hard to imagine a better brownie if you're a chocolate freak... They were so rich I scheduled an angioplasty the next day...

These brownies were OK but I absolutely agree with the cook who recommended the 'Brownies Cockaigne' from the 'Joy of Cooking' cookbook. Those are the standard by which all other brownies should be judged ! Scrumptious ! I've tried many other recipes but always come back to that one. My considerable reputation as a baker of amazing brownies rests on that recipe alone.

I found that using mini-morsels instead of regular size chocolate chips improved the texture of these wonderfully chocolatey brownies.

Never met a brownie I didn't like but usually prefer ones with nuts. This was very good but I would add nuts next time.

If you like this recipe, try JOY OF COOKING's "Brownies Cockaigne" recipe, which is slightly more time consuming but well worth it. I was disapointed by "Triple Chocolate Fudge Brownies", but only because I was comparing the two.

Everyone loves these brownies! Very rich, and fudgy! Serve these with a dollop of vanilla frozen yogurt on the side, for a great dessert!

This is, hands down, the best brownie recipe I've come across. We love it... and it couldn't be simpler to make!!!

Scrumptious! This was by far one of the best and easiest brownie recipes I've ever made. For those of you in California, I used Ghiardelli bittersweet and See's chocolate chips. Very rich!
