I agree with marshagirl: use dried or fresh apricots.....but don't complain about the dried apricots which are available year-round and have a wonderful flavor. Don't want the calories from ice cream? Use vanilla-flavored Greek yogurt. And to the snark: the child is beautiful. Tried the recipe as is: it's very good.

katkaki19, if you want to use fresh fruit, use fresh fruit; it's just a different recipe then. Dried fruit is an excellent source of fiber, and has a different texture from fresh. Obviously, that is the texture the recipe-writer wanted.

You're right, Jenebuck. I calculated the calories, and it came out to 230.7 calories per serving. That is not outragous for a special dessert. A plain apple has 95 calories. This is a light and refreshing dessert for special occasions. I served it at my July 4 party and it was lovely.

Please ignore the first review, it is incompetent and ignorant. Making fun of the cover photo does not a recipe review make! This is a delicious and easy to assemble dessert that, as clearly noted, makes FOURTEEN servings. FOURTEEN. Apricots, granola and vanilla ice cream are a delicious and refreshing addition to the fudge sundae rotation. Folks, let's keep these reviews sensible and focused on the actual recipe. Your snarky prose is not helpful or funny.

No forks here - this is not a "kid-friendly" recipe, it's a step on the path to obesity, as the cover photo of the chunky pre-adolscent shows! Epicurious, this was a big misstep.
