Just not good. Chicken was moist. The pineapple, Oj and buttered crackers were way too sweet. Next time I want Caribbean chicken, I will make jerk chicken. I will not make this again

I will be making this again. It was very good.

Very delicious! I served it for my book club and they loved it. I was able to put it together ahead of time and just put it in the oven prior to serving. Our book assignment was Shopgirl by Steve Martin. I selected this entree with a mango salad because the lead characters had their second date at Cha Cha Cha! The recipe is a keeper!

Had this at a neighbor's dinner party and loved it. All seven of us enjoyed it. The Cook from Los Angeles must have done something wrong, because I'm a very picky chicken eater -- don't usually care for it -- and I thought it was terrific.

This was wonderful!!! I made it for a dinner party of 9 and they all loved it and asked for the recipe! It was wonderful with the Carribean-style Black Beans and Rice Salad as a side dish with some fresh fruit salad and the Keylime/mango Cheesecake for dessert!!

This dish was delicious! I had it at a friends house last night and couldn't wait to get the recipe and make it for my family. It has a wonderful slighlty sweet/nutty crumb stuffing that added a lot to the taste of the chicken. I loved the sauce over rice. Yummy!

This dish was horrid! The dry and salty Ritz crackers ruined what looked like it might have been a good recipe. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I still get teased about my failed Carribean chicken dish. Some of my dinner guests reported having nightmares! So, have a Dionne Warwick moment and "Walk on By" this one. : )

This is really great and easy to make in a hurry. It goes very nicely with rice and I have substituted the Ritz cracker crumbs with regular bread crumbs. Delicious and it is a "get dinner on the table quick" recipie.
