Quick and easy and delicious. The clams I had were small--I would increase the number of clams.

This is one of my absolute favorite dishes. I like to use 1 tablespoon of fennel seeds instead of the recommended 2 tsp. I also add 1/4 c of Pernod. The Pernod really adds a great depth of flavor.

The broth was too salty. Using clams straight from the ocean the day before may have contributed too much salt. I would omit the clam juice next time and use water. Good bread really makes this yummy.

Two words.........Dee Lish!!! Made this for my husband & I. My husband usually turns up his nose when I "sop" things up with bread but this time he joined right in. The fennel and sausage are a great combo.

Really really good and easy. Spicy sausage is key. Warm comfort food for winter week-night dinner.

Made again and was just as delicious. Red pepper flakes, dried oregano, whatever else was on hand and FRESH pasta! so good!

Great and simple. I used chorizo and grilled the slices first. Also FRESH black victorian musells and roma tomatoes with lots of parsley.

The flavors turned out wonderful. I doubled up on the broth so I could serve it with linguine and toasted bread. I also used mild sausage so that my kids could eat it (they loved it), and just added red pepper separately to the adult servings.

This is a very easy recipe and delicious. However, I cut the sausage into slices and cooked first.

Very tasty! And came together in a snap. Was able to enjoy my company as well as put together a great meal. Good over fresh linguine and with a red wine, we chose a J.L. Chave cotes du rhone.

This is very tasty and provides great results for the minimal time and effort involved. I served it over linguine and with bread to soak up the large amount of delicious broth.

this is a great, easy recipe that yields tremendous results. the broth is especially flavorful. the recipe doesn't say to do so, but if you serve it over pasta it's even better.
