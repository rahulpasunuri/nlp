I very much like this recipe. It has become a stand-by at our house due to the ease and speed of preparation. I always keep a package of frozen uncooked shrimp in my freezer from trader joes. As we like the flavoring but not too much heat, I use ONLY about 1/3 of the cajun/creole seasoning. I recently ran out of the seasoning and not remembering the brand bought a different one. This one doesnt have the complexity of the other seasoning and so the dish is less delicious. That may be why some reviewers don't enjoy the dish. i suggest making sure you like the spice mixture or make your own as one reviewer recommended. Do try this easy tasty recipe.

This recipe was really simple. I got frozen pre-cooked shrimp, but it worked out fine. Also after reading some reviews about it being too salty I decided to use a salt-free cajun spice and a low sodium soy sauce, definitely wasn't salty at all after those two changes. I served it over angel hair pasta to make it more of a meal, bread would have been a good addition too. Next time I make this I will be adding more spice to it, maybe some jalapenos or more cayanne pepper.

I've made this recipe many times and always cut the olive oil in half. I think I usually mix up my own cajun seasoning, but tonight I decided to use Slap Ya Mama, which was way too salty. I was concerned about the sodium, since salt was the 1st ingredient, so cut the soy sauce in half and used low sodium (which is all that I ever use). It was still too salty. So I think the cajun seasoning is to blame, not the soy sauce for other reviewers that complained about the saltiness. This was the 1st time we did not love this dish.

I have been usign this recipe since I first read it in the magazine back in 1992. I agree with everyone the oil could be less and sometimes it is salty. It turns out a little different each time depending on the cajun spice you use but it is awesome!! I always serve it over angel hair pasta which makes it a great meal

This is my favorite go to appetizer recipe! I have been making it since it first appeared in Bon Appetit in 1992.It is a hit whenever I make it and wherever I take it! A friend just made this and put the shrimp over fresh spinach and sprinkled with parmesan for a great dinner salad or side salad dish! We have another friend who can't wait for the all of the shrimp to be eaten so he can sop up the olive oil mixture from the baking dish with crusty bread!

We've been using this recipe since 1992! It wonderful! Serve it over rice. The rice soaks up that yummy spicy sauce.

Our family serves this over Uncle Ben's or jasmine rice, with freshly-steamed broccoli. So we make a double batch of sauce and use a bag of the 20 ct. shrimp (frozen/deveined/shelled) from Costco. When doubling the sauce, we only use 1/2 - 2/3 cup olive oil, and keep the same proportions -- except increase the honey to ~1/3 - 1/2 cup. We omit the cayenne and use Weber's cajun barbecue seasoning. Sauce is best when blended in a food processor. Enjoy!

I have been making this recipe since March of 1992 and every time it is a tremendous hit with everyone. Both of my adult boys (now 27 & 30, eek!) have requested this recipe to prepare for their families and friends. Definitely a family tradition and favorite!

I doubled the recipe with the exception of the olive oil. I thought 1 cup would have been overboard. I used 1/2 Creole seasoning and 1/2 no-salt Creole seasoning based on previous reviewers and it was still too salty. I think the soy sauce is maybe the problem. It tasted good but could have been a lot less salty. I will make it again but maybe try low-sodium soy sauce or maybe more of the salt-free Creole seasoning.

I have been making this dish since 1992. It has always been a big hit at home or any party I have brought it to. I make mine with 1lb of 16- 20 count shrimp and 1 lb of fresh u10 sea scallops (big ones). I use 1 and 1/2 T of Creole instead of 2T, 1/3 C evoo and add a splash of granulated garlic. I also try to prepare it the morning I am going to bake it. Bring to room temp and then bake for 4 mins.. flip and bake for 4 more. Don't over cook or it will be tough. It continues to cook in the pan. Make sure you have some crusty french bread warmed for dipping. Yum!! Also don't convection oven cook it. It comes out better if you just use your regular bake setting.

i love this recipe as it is simple, tasty, and so quick to prepare. i do use only a teaspoon of the creole spice as it is salty and i also use low salt soy sauce. i substitue cilantro for the parsley at times and add it after i cook the shrimp. i find that the shrimp only takes about 7 minutes for medium shrimp, they continue to cook after they are out of oven. the creole powder turns the shrimp a beautiful corally pink color and the green cilantro makes a lovely presentation. i serve over rice or angel hair pasta, along with broccoli with garlic and ginger. this is a favorite meal.

I agree with other reviewers... I used Creole seasoning that contained no salt and this dish was still too salty. It was also too spicy and this comes from a person who adds crushed red pepper to everything she eats. No one in my family liked this dish - huge disappointment and waste of good shrimp.

Rating: 4
To the cook from Houston, Tx...it clearly states in the introduction of the recipe in the Bon Appetit Cookbook to use a Cajun/Creole seasoning with little to no salt. Your bad experience with this recipe is clearly due to the creole blend you used. I have nothing but great things to say about this recipe! It's fast, it's easy and it's absolutely delicious. I served it over basmati rice and the rice soaked up all the sauce. WONDERFUL!! The great thing about this recipe is it's good enough for a company meal, but low maintenance enough to throw together on a busy weekday. This will definitely go in the permanent rotation!

I tried this recipe exactually as it was printed in the new Bon Appetite cookbook and it was very salty. There is no mention in the recipe of using a Cajun or Creole spice that does not contain salt. Adding the soy sauce put it way over the edge. I wish the cookbook would have printed their own version of a Cajun or Creole spice with the recipe.

Rating: 4
Delicious - a hit at a party I brought them to last night. The key was creating my own cajun spice (from one of the Epicurious recipes suggested below), and drastically reducing the salt. One question I had reading the other reviews was how to serve this dish if you're serving it to a large group of people as an appetizer and not over rice or pasta as a first course. I broiled the shrimp & heated up the marinade on the stove, then piled the shrimp onto a serving dish with two accompanying bowls (one with lemon wedges, the other with the heated marinade) and a basket of sliced crusty bread. Like another reviewer, I made one example - bread, shrimp, spooned sauce over the top & squeezed some lemon over. Today I made more with leftover marinade & this time I baked it as called for in the recipe. This is the way to go if you want to serve it over rice or pasta. A definite keeper!

This has been a favorite of ours since it came out in 1992. Everyone loves it! I have added scallops with the shrimp for something different. It also tastes great over pasta. You do need to use a seasoning that is lower in salt. Otherwise the salt can be overpowering. This one is a keeper!

I served this for lunch at my ouse for the Canasta Group. It went together quickly, tasted terrific and was perfect for those of us who don't want to be banished to the kitchen for prepping the meal.

While making it, I kept thinking that it was way too easy to be good. Wow - what a hit! I didn't have honey so instead I substituted light corn syrup and a tablespoon of dark brown sugar.

I've made it several times as an appetizer for parties, following the recipe exactly; everyone loves it. I even converted a neighbor who swore she hated seafood. Marinating it too long may make it overly salty, or if your cajun spices are salty already - b/c shrimp seems to have a natural saltiness anyway.

We made this last night as a appetizer for our gourmet club, it was New Orleans night. It was a big hit. Someone in our group also commented that soaking up the sauce in the French bread was great. We did 2-1/2 lbs for a group of 6 and they were all gone. For the Creole seasoning we used the "Creole Seafood Seasoning" recipe also found on this site. For presentation I put the strained shrimps in a bowl in the center of a tray covered with green leaf lettuce with the lemon slices and strips of red bell pepper alternating in a burst pattern from the bowl. I put the French bread in a basket. I also strained some of the olive oil off the sauce and put it in a separate bowl with a small ladel. I explained to the group that they were to put three shrimps on a piece of french bread with a strip of bell pepper squeeze a lemon slice over it and pour a little sauce over it all letting it soak into the bread below. Then fold and eat. Yum. We made eaxtra Creole Seafood Seasoning and definitely plan to make this again. It was fast, easy and very tasty.

Fantastic! I was afraid the marinade would completely overwhelm the shrimp, but instead it brought out a rich, almost sweet seafood flavor. Definately a keeper! Everybody raved. I, too, heeded salt warnings and used half cajun and half creole seasoning (my cajun was salty while the creole wasn't). Doubled the amount of shrimp and made 1-1/2 recipe for marinade. The ratios were perfect. Doubling the marinade would have been too much liquid. Used a larger pan so that the shrimp would fit in a single layer. Made the marinade the night before to allow flavors to blend, then marinated the shrimp for about 3-4 hours (though I'm sure 1 hour would have been fine). They were perfect. Truly delicious.

This is the easiest and best shrimp recipe on the planet! Only problem I had was the first time I made it, I used a regular creole seasoning and it was way too salty (and I LOVE salt - so you know it had to be salty). Second time I used half no-salt creole seasoning and half regular - it was perfect. I also add tabasco. Served it over a lb of angel hair and mixed in some sauted julienne red peppers & carrots and chopped mushrooms.

This recipe is fantastic!! I decided to double it and serve it over garlic rice (Uncle Ben's) as a main course. I took the advice of any earlier review and used Chef Paul Perdomme's Seafood Magic. I can't imagine that a Creole/Cajun seasoning could have been any better. I made the sauce 3 hours ahead of time and let all of the flavors marinate together before combining it with the shrimp for the hour of refrigeration. I will definitely make this recipe again and have passed it along to all of my friends and family.

It still turned out wonderful and now I'm on the hunt for a great Cajun seasoning. YUMMY!!!

I am nicknamed the "shrimp lady" by friends and relatives. Anytime I am only invited to parties if I promise to bring along my shrimp. This recipe is soooooooo easy and it is simply delicious.

Way too salty. Maybe it was the brand of creole seasoning I used. (I used a brand called Konriko which now that I look at the ingred. the 1st ingredient is salt). This might be good if only half the Creole Seasoning and maybe tobasco added. We could hardly eat it beause of the salt. UCK

Very nice accompaniment to grilled fillet mignon. I used 1/4 c. each of olive oil and butter. Also tossed in cloves of mashed roasted garlic. I prefer not shelling the shrimp and sauteed them on the cooktop rather than baking, for more control of cooking. Added the parsley during last few seconds of cooking for a nicer presentation. Could probably cut down on the Cajun/Creole seasoning for more of a balanced flavor.

I didn't have any cayenne pepper so substituted tabasco, it worked great. Served it with orzo and a salad and it was a wonderful quick meal.

It's spicy but that's about all. The marinade, which I didn't much like, completely overpowers the shrimp. Not a keeper.

This is the best shrimp recipe I've ever tasted. I first saw it in the magazine in 1992. I have made it for everyone I know. It gets rave reviews every time.

I've been making this recipe ever since it appeared in '92. It is always outstanding and is a great recipe for company because it is so fast and easy. I usually serve this with brown rice which works out great since the brown rice cooks while the shrimp is marinating.

Good Shrimp Dish. Easy to make. I have been doing a Shrimp dish very close to this for years, and people love it.

I substituted cilantro for the parsley in this recipe and served it over angel hair pasta. I thought it was good, but not great. It seemed to be lacking something. It was spicy, but that was about it in terms of flavor. On the plus side, it was very easy to prepare.

I've had this recipe for a long time, but lost it in a move (my recipe files aren't the most organized). I've been craving it for some time. Thanks so much for providing this site as a companion to the magazine! I've always loved my Bon Appetit!

This is so easy and yet so delicious. I usually serve it with angel hair pasta and a salad and a loaf of french bread. I make it for my family and also for company.

I used this recipe in a Cajun Cooking Recipe Contest. I had to prepare it at a radio station on a Coleman stove. It works just as well pan frying everything as baking it. It was a big hit! The juice is so good with French bread to soak it up with. Could be used as an appetizer or as a main dish. I think it would be delicious over pasta but would double the sauce portion.

This is a great, easy dinner. I use less cajun spice and serve it over linguini for an entree.

I substituted molasses for the honey I didn't have, and added a bit more hot sauce. It is a delightful dish, and makes a great finger food or entree.
