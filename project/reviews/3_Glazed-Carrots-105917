Try adding a little pinch of powdered/ground ginger. Adds a nice fresh zing.

While it was tasty, it would have been even better if I hadn't over-reduced the glaze. (My fault, not the recipe's.) Still, I will certainly make it again, and fix my own mistake.

I made these carrots when my nieces and nephews (all young children) came to visit. They LOVED them. It's a very good recipe and quite easy to make.

They turned out great! I personally chose to use pre-cut carrot "chips", which worked great. On a negative point, I don't think I cooked the glaze long enough at the end because it never thickened that well (but that's an error on my part, not the recipe).

I followed the directions exactly and really enjoyed these carrots. Only thing I didn't have in the house was parsley so I did without and they still were excellent. Not too sweet which was what I was looking for.

This was an easy and delicious recipe that my boyfriend and I enjoyed making together. We used baby carrots and steamed them for a few minutes before adding them to the glaze. I will definitely be making these again!

This is an awesome recipe. I use it every traditional dinner that I have the chance. You need to follow the directions almost exactly to get the desired product. I agree that leaving the heat at the end is better, unless you have some time to kill. I like raw sugar instead of brown. Even sized pieces work best.

Yum!

Glazed baby carrots are one of my favorite "restaurant" vegetables and this recipe captured what I longed for at home. Use baby carrots or smaller organic carrots. Substitute maple sugar (or real maple syrup) for brown sugar, use all chicken broth and no water, and omit the lemon juice (keep it sweet and let the parsley balance the flavor). This is now one of my all time favorite vegetable recipes.

This recipe is both easy and delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and blanched the carrots before cooking, which turned out to be a good idea. The carrots were still perfectly firm when I served them.

I also steamed the carrots instead of cooking them in the sauce. This recipe was okay - a little on the sweet side for me, but my husband thought it was good.

I pre-steamed the carrots (I also used baby carrots for ease and convenience) while I boiled the sugar mixture. This made them al dente but just right in my book. I also left the burner on high and stayed with the glaze. They were awesome - just what I was looking for!

Many of the previous cooks who made this recipe said that the glaze was thin........I found it perfect and watched closely as it reduces to form a syrup and then mixed it with my carrots. Oh! Much better to pre-cook carrots or steam them al dente and drain them. Then, the carrots do get cooked. I would make this again and am very happy with the easy recipe!

The carrots had an odd flavor. I won't be making them again.

Quick and easy with a good result. For the time and effort.....it was worth it.

Good, but missing something. Will look for it instead of remaking this one.

Solid carrot recipe that's easy to make. I didn't lower the heat at the end and it took no time for the sauce to reduce. Unfortunately some carrot pieces were undercooked. You have to make sure the carrot pieces you're cooking are even sized as this recipe just "barely" cooks em and larger ones are likely to be undercooked. I added dried coconut flakes for a nice touch.

This was delicious and unlike other recipes, makes enough sauce to go around. It took a while for it to reduce, though, so next time I might add some corn starch. Very tasty as is.

Will try this again w/o the lemon.
