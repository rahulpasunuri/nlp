although i did not make this recipe exactly (no, i am not usually one of those people) and rarely write reviews, i did use the base (flour, milk, eggs, powder and vinegar) for a fritter with sweet potato, fennel and sweet onion. it was so fantastically tender i had to give it a rating!

I made this as an appitizer for Rosh Hashana. We are not Kosher. It was a big hit and I loved the dipping sauce that goes with it.

I made these recently for just my husband and myself using the chili sauce in the batter and we loved them. However, I didn't use the Tamarind Dipping Sauce which I'm sure is what makes these different. I just had on hand a sauce that had mayo, italian seasoning, buttermilk, garlic powder, red wine vinegar, and grated onion in it. I am going to make it again this weekend for company to serve with paninis.
