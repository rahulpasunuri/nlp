Mmm. So rich and delicious. True, it's not very pretty to look at, and it's a lot of work for eggs, but the end result tasted great and would work for dinner or brunch.

This is all we ate while touring Burgundy. It's an incredible taste pairing; velvety, strong and very pleasing to the palatte. Excellent!

I made this a while ago, but I guess I forgot to rate it. This recipe definitely takes lots of time, and is very messy, and the end result is not that aesthetically pleasing, but the taste is wonderful. Oeufs en meurette is one of my favorite dishes.

I actually think that any discussion on a dish is helpful. We can't take all recipes at face value. All cooks and chefs alike discuss ingredients and processes before taking on a meal. Bravo to anyone who enjoys discussion in a public forum. For those who value a more rigid protocol, stick with your Joy of Cooking and let us enjoy the freedom that this site provides.

I think it's more useful if we actually RATE the recipes rather than think about whether or not a recipe is any good!

This recipe sounds delicious (3 forks) but am concerned as to how much work is involved as well as the length of time to make it. I love poached eggs but try and keep things simple as I am 74 yrs old and tire easily. In view of the fact that it can be made over 2 day time, may be better for me since I try to do as much as possible in advance and then put together just before ready to serve. I am intrigued enough that I probably will try it one day when I am feeling up to it.
