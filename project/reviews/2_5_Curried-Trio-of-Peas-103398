I love curried anything as a rule-however, I think the chicken broth did not serve the peas well. Also maybe the curry spices were a bit much for the crispy pods-this whole recipe was just not my cup of tea.

I used sugar snap peas and asparagus spears, no chicken broth. I sauteed them in butter and chipotle flavored olive oil. Delicious!

Our company loved the recipe. I increased the liquid and added butter sauteed sliced small mushrooms. My company said it was a Gourmet dish.

I made this only with plain frozen green peas and added some chicken breast, and it was great! Really intense flavor. I had to reduce the sauce about 3 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.

My husband adores peas and thought this dish was excellent.
