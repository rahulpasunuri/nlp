The first time I made this I measured the liquid as stated in the recipe and it turned out runny (creamed potatoes, my father-in-law said). So I gave it a fair shake and made it again more carefully a few weeks later. It tasted okay, but I have a number of mashed potato variants in line well ahead of this recipe.

I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything wrong to this recipe and it turned out pretty disappointing. I say it tastes like baby food and twigs, my boyfriend said it'd be good if it was the end of the world and there was nothing else to eat. I think I'll stick with mashed sweet potatoes.

Delicious! Would definitely make again.

Excellent! I made a vegan version with no cheese and soy milk/margarine instead and it was delicious!
