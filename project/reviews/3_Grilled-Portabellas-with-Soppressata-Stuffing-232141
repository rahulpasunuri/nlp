While I made a few changes to the recipe, the general gist of it was quite good (grilling mushrooms with the stuffing). I substituted lowfat sour cream (others in the house have an aversion to mayo) and used random herbs from the garden instead of oregano. I also added a dash of white wine since I used canned bread crumbs instead of fresh (too much trouble) and the filling got a bit dry. We actually had the mushrooms as a main course with a salad, but I could imagine using creminis and doing them in a grill pan for a more finger-foodie appetizer.
