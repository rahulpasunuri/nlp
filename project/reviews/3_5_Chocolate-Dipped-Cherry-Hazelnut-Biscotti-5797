Fun and easy to make. We did not even bother to dip these, we added mini chocolate chips to the dough and they were perfect. I always chop the cherries down a bit before I add them to the dough. A keeper, I will make this again.

I have not made it "yet" but received some for New Years my sister made & it was absolutely yummy, guess what the men are getting for V Day :)

Whenever I bake something for the first time, I read several recipes; in addition to watching its preparation (if available). This recipe was no exception, and yet I felt as if I'd missed a step. The end result was good, not great, and, as one reviewer said, required a bit more sugar and an additional egg. Also, I used one cup less flour, added some freshly squeezed orange juice and a few splashes of spiced rum (Frangelico would have enhanced the flavour more, but I was out). If your oven is well-calibrated, you'll do fine with the recommended times/temps. If it isn't: do not leave your kitchen - you'll need to check their progress on the second baking - often! Finally, the texture was good - like those made by professionals, but the flavour lacked.

Amazing! I made this with a friend and we both liked the idea of, instead of the semisweet dip, white chocolate in the batter. It is amazing as is, though.

I made this recipe for a holiday party with friends lsat year, and it was such a hit that I have been asked to make every single time we get together. To mix it up, I made of the recipe the original way, and for the other half I replaced the cherries and hazelnuts with craisins and almonds, and used white chocolate instead of the bittersweet.

I served this at my gourmet dinner party. Everyone loved it! I used almonds instead of hazelnuts, It was moist and crunchy. I would definitly serve this again

Excellent recipe. I made these for the holidays and they were a huge hit. When packaged in glass canisters they made a great casual gift. I made one small change. Instead of the cocoa powder - I melted dark chocolate in a double broiler and drizzeled it on top after cutting. It was just the little bit of extra chocolate it needed

I have made this recipe for the holidays for several years now, at least one year at former recipients' request (read:pleading)! The only time I didn't love them is when I used dried bing cherries (instead of the usual sweetened tart cherries) which were too sweet and large and ended up burning a bit where the cut edge touches the cookie sheet (although no one else seemed to have a problem with them and they ate them right up anyway.) They are a bit more work than non-dipped biscotti, but the cherry hazelnut chocolate combination when dipped in hot coffee to slightly melt the chocolate is fabulous. A hit every time!

Of all the biscotti recipes I've made, I found this one to be the least successful. I found them lacking in taste and texture, there are surely better recipes out there.

Am I the only person who did not enjoy these biscotti? They were easy to make,and behaved beautifully in the baking,slicing, and re-baking. It was their taste that left me wanting!They were lacking a definitive flavor. I am determined to find a really delicious biscotti recipe that I can proudly share with my Italian relatives. Sadly, this one isn't it!

I THOUGHT THESE WERE VERY GOOD AND QUITE EASY TO MAKE. THE DOUGH WAS A BIT CRUMBLY PRIOR TO KNEADING, SO I WET MY HANDS FIRST AND THEN IT CAME TOGETHER NICELY. I SUBSTITUTED ALMONDS FOR HAZELNUTS AND LOVED THE COMBONATION WITH THE CHERRIES. MADE SOME WITHOUT CHOCOLATE, AND THESE SEEMED TO BE PREFERED IN MY HOUSE, BUT THE CHOCOLATE MAKES A NICE PRESENTATION. WILL MAKE THESE AGAIN FOR MYSELF, AS WELL AS FOR GIFTS.

To the cook with soft dough - yes, check your oven temperature and make sure your oven maintains the correct temperature. Also, the biscotti must sit for a full 15 minutes before you cut it. But after putting it back in the oven and cooking again it should be a bit crisp. The reason why this recipe makes so much is because you will be lucky to have a few pieces left for yourself after your friends sample it. Outstanding - easy to make - freezes.

Loved the flavor of these cookies. I did have a bit of a hard time getting the dough to cook all the way thru on the first baking. Maybe my over was not hot enough? It seemed like the dough was still raw. Is that normal w/ biscottis?

Rating: 3
Great biscotti and easy to make (will never buy biscotti again). These are good both with and without the chocolate. Substituted dried cranberries for the cherries because I had them on hand. They were a very nice addition to our New Year's Eve progressive dinner buffet dessert menu (neighbor's stopped by for leftovers on New Year's day)

This recipe was fantastic! My first time making biscotti and everyone (even my boyfriend, who doesn't normally like baking) loved it! I didn't toast or husk the hazelnuts and it still turned out fine.

I would make this again but decrease the sugar by half. The sugar changed the texture of the biscotti so that although it is hard, it had more of a candy-like hardness from the sugar. Other than that the taste is nice and I would make these again.

Rating: 3
These are VERY sweet, I think you can reduce sugar by one cup. I didn't find dried cherries in my (Australian) supermarket, so substituted dried cranberries, however I will make them again without this ingredient because it makes the biscotti a bit chewy and you get bits stuck in your teeth. You need to really watch these in the oven, mine were done the first time at about 30 minutes, not 55. Also, for the second baking times, you need to be very careful as they can burn from one minute to the next. I'm not sure if they are meant to be quite 'hard' to bite, but will try them again as they were quite delicious and very inexpensive to make compared to buying them in a deli.

These were the best biscotti we've ever eaten! Based on other reviewer's notes I: cut down on the orange zest (used 3 teaspoons); used a variety of nuts (thought the almonds and hazelnuts tasted the best) and shaped the logs a little thinner and longer (11-inch x 2-inch). I can't wait to make them again -- they were gone so quickly that I suspect that some were hoarding bunches of cookies :)

Rating: 3
I thought 1/2 inch was a bit too thick. the logs are large, so 1/4 to 1/3 inch is a nicer size, especially after dipping in chocolate which adds another layer of thickness (at least to one end of the cookie).

This will be my second Christmas making these since they were well received the first. I am going to dip them in white chocolate even though they are yummy plain. One thing I would like to know is if anyone found an easy way to husk the hazlenuts.

Rating: 4
i just made these along with several other biscotti & they turned out great. i had no trouble with the cherries burning but maybe that's because i like softer biscotti. these were great & a nice mix with the double chocolate walnut biscotti (these are my all-time-favorite, gets-the-most-raves, everyone-asks-for-the-recipe biscotti. You've got to try them is you like chocolate!)

Rating: 4
I wondered about the "log" when I put it in the oven...woudl it keep it's shape? These came out AMAZING! So tasty! the only thing I'd recommend is that when you bake them the 2nd time, lower the heat, and stand them upright instead of on each side. Mine tended to get just a wee bit too brown the first time, but maybe it was just my oven?

Better than any cafe bought biscotti I have ever had. Made these as Christmas presents and everyone raved. We left out the cherries and only used a touch of orange zest.

Rating: 3
This is the first biscotti recipe I have made and I have already made it twice. I might think about leaving out the orange peel next time and some of my cherries did get well done, particularly those on the ends. May try dried strawberries for a different taste. Instead of dipping each biscotti, melted chocolate and poured it over biscotti and spread chocolate with back of a spoon. Much faster! Didn't find hazelnuts so I used slivered almonds.

I made 4 kinds of biscotti yesterday and was least impressed with this recipe. The cherries tasted bitter and the orange peel made it too citrusy. The Triple Chocolate Biscotti, however, are excellent.

Rating: 2
One question, for others who've loved this recipe - in the second baking, after slicing, did you have a problem with the cherries browning too much? I ended up with golden brown biscotti, and nearly burnt cherries, which added an unfortunate taste. After dipping in chocolate, not too bad, but these were bitter from the over-cooked cherries. Any suggestions?

Rating: 4
I echo the sentiments of those who love this recipe. Just a fantastic mix of flavors. When I make them again I'll be sure not to chop the hazelnuts too finely - halving them is probably perfect. I dipped them in Valhrona bittersweet chocolate, and dusted them with Valhrona cocoa powder for the ultimate in sinful extravagence. The dark chocolate plays off both the nuts and the dried cherries beautifully.

This recipe was a hit! It was super easy and I loved the fact that the biscotti were nice and long -- that makes them great for dipping in coffee! I made these for my husband's company as Christmas gifts and everyone raved about them! I also recommend the double chocolate walnut biscotti.

After reading the MANY raves about this recipe I had to add it to my cookie Christmas trays. WARNING when the recipe says "logs will spread during baking" BELIEVE IT. Even though I CHILLED the logs overnight they ended up spreading to unbiscotti like sizes. I measured one and it was over 6 1/2" wide and not a very nice depth. I only cooked mine for 50 minutes. The flavor was good but I certainly won't be trying these again. FYI I pulled out another recipe I have had success with. It calls for the logs to be 16 inches long , 1 1/2 wide and 1/2 deep. Obviously the directions for these at 9 inches by 3 and then spreading would result in a HUGE Biscotti.

This recipe is fabulous!!! I have made this for Christmas gifts for teachers and neighbors for the last three years. People rave about it and beg for more. I sometimes substitute dried blueberries which is unusual and delicious. Also, I melt chocolate in a squirt bottle and sqeeze it out in a design pattern over the biscotti. Much faster than the dip method.

This is fantastic. It is now a Christmas tradition for me and I make it as gifts or for holiday pot-lucks. I usually substitute cranberries for the cherries and add a few almonds or walnuts/pecans instead of just hazelnuts.

This one always gets requests for more. It's relatively easy, it works, and the kids love it. I've never found any this good at the supermarkets by me--and the ones close to this are $1.50 a piece.

Although these biscotti got raves from my co-workers, I wasn't that crazy about them. I've bought better-tasting ones from the supermarket. Also, mine didn't take as long to cook as the recipe called for.

This year a pal of mine suggested I include these biscotti in my holiday cookie baskets. And she was right!!! The combination of the tart cherries and the rich, dark chocolate is delicious. And they present beautifully. One batch goes a long way--the perfect gift for sybaritic friends! I won't hesitate to bake them again!

These biscotti taste great, even before you dip them in chocolate. I made three different varieties, and this one was by far the best. I cut the recipe in half, and used a food processor instead of a electric mixer.

I am a major biscotti fan and have made over 6 different recipes of various biscotti. This one did NOT appeal to me as others did. I followed the recipe except I substituted almonds for hazelnuts. The taste of the biscotti itself seems bland and unappealing to me at this stage. I will be dipping them in Lindt chocolate tomorrow ('course what wouldn't taste good then?), but I would expect that for the time spent, these should also taste great without chocolate, and they don't. I'll keep looking for the ultimate biscotti recipe!

My Mom and I first tried this recipe at Christmastime in 1998 and have made it for family & friends each year since. I recently moved and panicked when I realized my 12/98 issue of Bon Appetite had been discarded in the process. Both my Mom and I were very excited to find this favorite recipe online so we can enjoy it once again this year.

This is a favorite of all ages in our family. I adjust the baking time, making a softer bar for my elderly parents, and more traditionally for my husband who enjoys taking it to share as a dunking bar with co-workers.

I halved the recipe, but found the dough too dry to work with. I added another egg, which helped, but did effect the final result. Also, I omitted the cherries and orange zest (I don't like cherries), and added a half teaspoon almond extract (1 teaspoon for a whole recipe). Next time I make these I'll use 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract and use almonds instead of hazelnut. My husband, however, loved them as they were, but what does he know...he's not the biscotti fan I am!

I left out the chocolate because they tasted so good dipped in coffee without the topping. I gave some to my italian mother in law and my wifes italian girl friend as the true test. they both loved this recipe.

I made these cookies for Christmas this year and my results were consistent with those of the other reviewers -- everyone loved them. This recipe was easier to work with than other biscotti recipes I've tried, and the cookies were very crunchy and rich. I didn't have too much trouble with them breaking either, even though I used a lot of hazelnuts, almonds and assorted dried fruit. Like some other reviewers, I also didn't bother with the chocolate dipping -- they got eaten up before I had a chance!

I've made this recipe quite a few times, now, and I always get requests for more. The orange flavor comes through just enough to taste and perfectly complements the other ingredients. Also, I have to admit, this is the best raw dough I've ever tasted.

well I have to agree with everyone else. This is the best biscotti recipe I have ever used! I couldn't find tart dried cherrys so I used dried cranberries instead and since it's so close to Christmas this was a great substitute.

Very tasty and crunchy. One tip is to make sure your hands are wet when working the dough into logs, that helps keep it from sticking to you. I also omitted the turning over step in the second cooking and cooked on one side for a total of 15 minutes. Even though they seem soft when you bring them out of the oven they crisp up as they cool.

This makes a great biscotti--I substituted dried cranberries for the cherries b/c I made it around the holidays, and it worked well. The orange rind gives a wonderful flavor--even if you are not a chocolate fan, just skip it and make the biscotti without it--it tastes great plain, too! (I had to sample, you know, before the chocolate!)

This was terrific. Found (in "The Cake Bible")an easy way to husk the nuts. You boil them briefly with baking soda and the husks fall off - no rubbing, etc.

One of the best biscotti recipes I have ever made-I have even had requests to share the recipe. And, although time consuming, the batter was so easy to make. Beware, though, this is definitely a sweet biscotti, better suited as an after-dinner dessert rather than a mid-morning coffee-break snack.

I work in a restaurant kitchen and make these biscotti often. Everyone who tries these say that they are the best they have ever had. I sometimes omit the dried fruit or substitute the hazelnuts with another nut, and they still come out delicious.
