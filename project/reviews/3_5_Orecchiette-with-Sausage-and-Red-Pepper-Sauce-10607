This was great, and so easy. Of course, I did make changes but kept to the concept of the dish. I added an onion, and used 5-6 red peppers, but only a small can of tomatoes and a tablespoon of paprika. This really made it a red pepper sausage sauce, rather than a tomato sauce with red pepper and sausage. I made it a couple weeks ago for company, who gobbled it down (ages 70-2) Tonight I'm making it again!

Made a couple changes to the recipe and turned out great. Used spicy sausage instead of the sweet Italian sausage. Added mushrooms, onions, capers, red pepper flakes and extra garlic and extra bell peppers.

Tasty once I added: more garlic, capers, sherry, red pepper flakes, bay leaf. Allow to simmer at least one hour to meld flavors.

I thought that this was a delicious recipe, although I did make a few changes. I used sliced chorizo, onions, and added an extra tin of tomatoes. Made sure to add a lot of basil too, and it came out delicious. Was a bit on the spicy side which I loved. Will make this again for sure

If you don't find it flavorful to your liking, just add to it! I added basil, onions, and bay leaves and let it simmer a bit longer. I also topped it with fresh parmesan before serving, and it was quite tasty!

Surprisingly bland. Easy yes, flavorful no. And I did use San Marzano tomatoes. Maybe if I make it again I will toss in some basil at the end, or use a spicier sausage.

This is such a simple sauce to make and totally delicious. I used San Marzano tomatoes, if you can get them use them, it really makes a difference to the sauce. I would definetly make this again.

Delicious! This was a very quick and easy recipe to follow. I used turkey sausage because we're watching our fat intake and used 1 tablespoon of olive oil for browning. There was little to no fat in the dish. Substituted orange peppers b/c red peppers were not available. Sweet tasting. A little grated romano cheese over the pasta would've put this one over the top.

Received compliments on dish. I thought it somewhat bland and too watery.

This was such a simple dish to make! Such great flavor from the sausage and pepper combination and malleable to your taste (I added extra garlic, being a huge garlic fan). I'd highly recommend!

This pasta dish was delicious. I used 2 lbs of sausage and added a can of "recipe ready" tomatoes in addition to the whole tomatoes called for in the recipe. The sauce took little time to make but tasted as if it had simmered for hours. It's a keeper!

After sauteing the peppers, I set half aside. I smimmered the sauce a little longer to really develope the peppers flavor. I added the saved peppers just before serving
